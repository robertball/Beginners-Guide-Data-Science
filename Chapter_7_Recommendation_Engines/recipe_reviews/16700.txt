Re-write of old review (again) - 
I've been making this dish since spring of 2002.  Instead of using salsa, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chili (first time I made this, I was out of salsa so I substituted a can of RoTel..have been making it without the salsa ever since!).  I put the entire package of taco seasoning (low sodium variety) in a ziploc bag, and dredge the chicken breasts.  Next, I poured some of the liquid off the tomatoes into the bottom of an 8x8 glass baking dish (I did this instead of greasing). I then placed the chicken breasts in the dish, and added a little fresh cracked pepper, and topped them with the tomatoes, and a dash or two of chipotle tobasco sauce.  Bake in a 400f oven for 30-35 mins- or if you cook with Science...temp to 140...carryover heat will finish it off)  Remove from oven.  Sprinkle with cheese and place back in oven for 3 mins or till cheese has melted.  (here's where carryover comes into play...) After your cheese is melted, take it out of the oven and remove it from the baking dish.  Cover with foil and let it rest for about 10 minutes.  This lets all the juices reabsorb.  Top with a dab sour cream. I serve this usually with spanish rice, mexican style corn (for this type of corn in a jiff...add some red/black pepper flakes, a little mrs dash,and 2-3 dashes of tobasco sauce..the man will even sometimes top the corn with a dab of shredded cheese), and a salad. Thanks for a great recipe!! Definitely a keeper!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: May 17, 2005. I was surprized to see this recipe roaming around on this site. I've been making this for years, ever since my husband and I first got together.

Sometimes, I will dredge the chicken in melted margerine/butter, then tortilla chips I've ground in the blender
that have been mixed with the taco seasoning. Then I'll use the sour cream/salsa as a dipping sauce, just to change things up.

Either way, it's a favorite in this house. If you don't have time to make a side to go with this, serve it with Zatarains Spanish Rice with a can of drained black beans stirred in.

EDITED: I make this now at least once a month. I now use my own homemade taco seasoning, green salsa sometimes, mexican cheese and reduced fat sour cream. It's good with pretty much anything, either wrapped up in tortillas or served with a side of steamed brown rice and sauteed onions and peppers. We love this dish.

Very tasty and easy meal to make. I marinated the chicken with the package of taco seasoning and 2/3 cup of water so it would not come out so spicy. Worked great! Chicken did not dry out and the seasoning was just right!

Excellent! I cooked this in the crockpot today. I put a very thin layer of salsa in the bottom of the crockpot. Then I took a package of "Taco Time" (the best) taco seasoning mix and put it into a plastic bag...put the chicken inside the bag to complete cover. I then took the chicken and put it on top of the salsa...covered the top of the chicken with a thin layer of salsa. Put the setting on low for about 6 hours...amazing. I didn't have time to melt the cheese on top but I'll be sure to do that next time. This turned out to be very moist...very kid friendly!!

Ok, I swear this is the last time I edit this review!!  I give this recipe 2-3 stars as written, & 5 stars made the way I prepare it.  I have made this many many times - the first time we did not care for it as I followed the recipe to a t - The chicken came out very bland.  With a few alterations on the recipe, I have come up with my husband's very favorite dish!  I toss the chicken in a ziploc bag with a packet of taco seasoning.  Then I pour a little salsa in the bottom of the casserole, add the coated chicken breasts, then pour over the rest of the salsa.  I cook it for about 35 minutes.  Then I remove it, and add some Mexican melting cheese & fresh chopped jalepenos, and cook for another 5 minutes.  It is sooooo good!  I have also found that a slice of pepperjack cheese tastes really good too, but there is something about that Mexican melting cheese & fresh diced jalapenos that leaves my hubby & I salivating!

Very easy and very quick, yet it tastes so good people will think you slaved for hours over this dish! I used "Taco Seasoning I" from this site for the taco seasoning and used Ortega's Medium chunky style salsa (a bit more than called for) and light Mexican blend cheese. After it comes out of the oven I pretty it up a bit by topping it off with some sliced black olives and thin sliced green onions.The chicken is tender, juicy and oh so good! It's perfect topped off with dollup of light sour cream and a side of Spanish rice - YUM!

Very Tasty!  I too used the mild taco seasoning and instead of shaking it in a bag I just eyeballed it and shook some on each side.  Used a slow cooker.  Put down a layer of El Pato Sauce then placed the chicken and topped it with a jar of mild Old El Paso Thick & Chunky.  Cooked it on low while I was at work (use the crock pot liners - they ROCK) and the house smelled wonderful when I came home.  The chicken breasts literally fell apart like a fine roast.  Served it with white rice and steamed "Mexican veggie blend" (white corn, black beans, peppers and onions).  The broth from the pot made a yummy topping for the rice.  Almost like a Taco Soup.  Very nice - husband requested it to be a regular at our house!

The beauty of this dish is that it is so ridiculously simple, with such few ingredients, that I really don't see the point in messing with it. This is good, simple, quick, and easy. Tastes like enchiladas without the tortilla!

My boys have loved this recipe for years, but I have done a slight variation, which they seem to enjoy even more.  Place 4 - 6 boneless chicken breasts in the crockpot, season with 1 pkt taco seasoning, cover with 8 oz salsa mixed with 1 can of crm. of chicken soup.  Cook 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low.  Take chicken out and shred with fork.  Place back in salsa mixture.  Serve over rice with shredded cheese & sour cream or even in tortillas... Yum!!  Update:  add can of drained black beans & corn.  Double Yum!

Our family really likes this dish. I don't use taco seasoning, I think the salsa gives it enough flavor. I also like to make this in the crockpot. I let the chicken cook thoroughly, then I shred it and add cheese just until it melts. I like to serve it with rice & corn chips.

This dish is AMAZING with a few changes! First off, don't use out of the bag taco seasoning. Instead, make your own! I use the following mix: 1 teaspoon paprika, 2 teaspoons ground cumin, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon oregano, 2 teaspoons garlic powder. Secondly, pound the breasts so they're relatively flat- this gives a better spice to chicken flavor ratio, and prevents you from getting the thicker chunks of chicken that are bland. It also helps even cooking. Don't just "sprinkle it on"- rub the spices on both sides of the chicken! I rub it on once side, place that side face down in the pan (which I spray with cooking spray before hand), then when they're all in the pan go and season and rub the other sides. Latly, use a shredded mexican cheese mix blend (also called nacho/taco mix) instead of cheddar cheese. We love this so much, I double the recipe and use a 9x12 to bake all of it. I always serve this with the Spanish Rice II recipe from this site- check out my review on that recipe for great alterations for the best outcome. Bland? Absolutely NOT! You don't even need the sour cream! I serve this to people and they RAVE about it! Give the changes a try- you won't be disappointed!

This recipe is so easy and tastey. Only thing I recommend is, pour the liquid off the salsa, so the salsa, itself; sticks to the chicken. My family loved this.

I was reading over the reviews...People, if you're going to make major changes, rewrite it as your own. All the "re-writes" are crazy. Sorry if, I offend anyone, but the rating scale should be on the recipe itself, and not your complete change of the original recipe. Minor tweaks, are ok.

So good!  I use Pace Thick & Chunky - it works perfectly because it has some body to it and it's already kind of "cooked", so putting it in the oven doesn't drastically alter it.  Really great with Mexican style corn and spanish rice as another person noted.  Easy and good dinner!!

I put the taco seasoning in a bag as others suggested, but it was just too spicy for my taste, even with mild sauce.  Will definitely make again, but go by the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe with us!

WHY THIS IS 5 STARS: Simply because you can make something that is CHEAP and SURPRISINGLY delicious in 5 minutes ...and that's going really slow!  Don't bother looking at the specifics as far as amounts.  Or even what it will taste like with "ick" taco seasoning on it... first off, you won't taste the taco seasoning and that's with putting a large amount over entire breast.  To finish this in 25 min at 375, you should pound these to 1/2" thick (basically take one breast and cut in half).   Put pam in a 13X9, breasts, seasoning (again, don't be shy), then put any salsa on.  I fit as much as I can fit on each breast.  Even using hot, the cheese really subdues the hotness so don't worry about it.  My toddlers eat it and they typically don't like MEAT (guess the key is all the cheese lol).  Bake, and then as stated, sprinkle as much of any kind of cheese on top for the last 5-10 min.  So simple.  If you want an equally simple and QUICK mexican rice, try "BEST SPANISH RICE"  ...you'll be shocked by the taste!

This chicken turned out fabulous.  I used bone-in chicken pieces and served it with spanish rice and tortillas.  Definately will make again.

Great minds think alike! I slapped these ingredients together...then I found the recipe. The only thing I do different is I split my chicken and put salsa and cheese in the middle and then I wrap each breast in individule foil packets and bake in the oven. It's one of my husbands favorite meals.

Good as written, but with a few minor variations, this is an awesome dish. I coat the chicken (either breasts or legs) with the Taco seasoning, pour in a can of Salsa Verde (or Green salsa), add a squeeze of lime, some salt, and a pinch of sugar. Then marinate overnight. The next day, pour everything into a baking dish, add more salsa so it covers the chicken, and bake until done (or put in a crockpot). At the last minute, sprinkle shredded Monterey Jack cheese over the chicken, and put back in oven until melted. Serve over yellow rice. Amazing!

This review has been updated. 

EXCELLENT! Yes, I'm shouting but for all the right reasons. It was so easy and simple to make and it came out very tasty. The sour cream should be included as a 'mandatory' ingredient since it adds a bit more flavor. Next time, as a suggestion to those who like their food spicy as I do, I'll add finely chopped chili peppers and mix them in the salsa sauce before pouring it over the chicken. I'll definitely make this simple yet tasty dish again.  Kudos to the creator of this wonderful recipe.

This is a great and easy chicken dish.  I shook the chicken breasts in a plastic bag with the taco seasoning mix.  I used "Herdez" mild salsa and poured the entire jar over the chicken.  I also added a small can of sliced black olives.  When the chicken was done, I sprinkled a good bit of Mexican cheese on top, baked the chicken the last few minutes. I served this with the Mexican Rice recipe found on this site, a can of black beans and a dollop of sour cream.

This was really good but I used a can of Rotel instead of the salsa and I added a few sprinkles of Mrs. Dash.  I followed the recipe other than that.  It came out moist and very flavorful, sort of spicy due to the chilis in the Rotel.  Next time I will try it with the salsa, but it was great the way I made it. *** UPDATE:  I made it again as written and it was super good...I think I will make it as written from now on.

Yum! I used 6 chicken breasts and a whole packet of dry taco seasoning. I then poured half of the seasoning in a ziplock bag and 3 chicken breast and shook to coat. I then poured the remaining seasoning mix and the other 3 chicken breats in the bag and repeated.  Gave extra zip and family enjoyed! Thank you Faye!

WOW!!! I dredged the chicken pieces through the taco seasoning and then, after baking, topped with dollops of sour cream. It was very good. I served it over rice (minute rice, the rest of the bag of taco seasoning, can of diced tomato, green pepper, and onion) and mixed in some sweet corn. It was excellent and my husband asked me to make it again the next night for dinner!

Easy and tasty! I've used both salsa and Rotel, and both turn out well. I've also done this both in the crock pot and baked in the oven and both methods turn out a delicious dish. This makes excellent leftovers. I've also pulled the chicken for leftovers and put the filling in a tortilla with cheese.

This was really good, especially considering how few ingredients went into it. I spread a can of refried beans into the bottom of the dish and then set the chicken on top. I just poured a packet of taco seasoning into a quart-sized ziploc, threw the chicken in, and gave it a few good shakes. I also used a fiesta blend of cheeses instead. Very simple and easy, and very good!

I made this for dinner tonight.  I had to make a variation in the recipe because I found that I didn't have salsa in my pantry.  I DID have Mexican Style Tomatoes which I felt would work just as well.  I pureed these in my food processor along with the taco seasoning then poured it over the chicken.  I also added Vidalia Onion slivers and tri-color peppers that I purchased frozen at Trader Joe's, placing the vegetables on top of the chicken pieces.  I baked the chicken and added the cheese and my family LOVED this dish!  It just couldn't have been easier to make and even though it didn't have the bite medium salsa would have had, the dish was a hit!  Either way you make the recipe you will end up with a tender, flavorful piece of chicken that your family will be sure to love:)  Most certainly a keeper!

This is one of those "why didn't I think of that?" recipes!  I used black bean and corn salsa, and I was very lazy and just crammed the chicken into the first baking dish I saw ( a 1 1/2 qt casserole) and dumped the whole jar of salsa over the chicken instead of just one cup. Between the smaller dish and the extra salsa, the chicken just stewed until it was so moist and tender you could cut it with a fork! Oh, and by all means, PLEASE use the Taco Seasoning l recipe from this site instead of storebought!

I love these flavors. I put the taco seasoning in a bag and add the chicken to coat it well.  I add 2 cups raw rice sauteed with butter, onions, bell pepper and  jalapeno peppers and place in the bottom  of the baking dish with 1 cup chicken broth. Add the chicken on top and bake. It is a full meal, my family and friends love it!  thanks for the sharing the recipe.

Giving 5 stars is SO rare for me. I give this 5 stars over all.

It was SO easy, and very yummy. My husband loved it, too.

I used 4 ginormous chicken breasts... and a whole packet of taco seasoning on both sides. I used a mix of Chi Chi's & Newmans own salsas and LOADED it with cheese.

I served it as follows - I spread a layer of refried beans over the bottom of the plates... placed the chicken on the beans, surrounded the beans in a circle of spanish rice, topped with a dollop of sour cream and spooned a little salsa on top of the sour cream.

It was very pretty, and so yummy. Clean up and prep time were minimal. Fantastic quick & easy meal. 

Thank you!

FABULOUS!  So moist and great tasting.  I made it for my husband who loved it and then for my girlfriend after she had some surgery.  They were impressed.  I put the chicken in a bag w/ the seasoning and shook it up.  Coats really well that way.  Couldn't have been easier.  I used Pace's Cilantro Salsa...YUM YUM YUM!!

My whole family liked this dish very much. I too cut the chicken into strips and served it in soft tortillas with lettuce and tomato. For a little twist on this recipe; saute chicken and bell pepper in a pan.  Add salsa, 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter, 3 tsp. lite soy sauce, 1 tsp. ginger and garlic to taste.  Simmer for about 15 minutes, serve over rice and sprinkle with peanuts.  You can't taste the peanut butter, but it gives the sauce a wonderful flavor.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome. I marinated the chicken with the taco seasoning on the counter top for 30 minutes before adding the salsa and baking. The chicken was tender, juicy and so full of flavor. I will be making this dish again. It's fast and easy. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I've been making this dish forever!! I serve it over yellow rice and my family loves it! The only difference in my recipe is that I omit the taco seasoning and squeeze fresh lime juice over the chicken when it's done. Delicious!!

Delicious, few ingredients and 5 minutes to prepare...this is definately worth 5 stars! I took a suggestion from another reviewer and cut my chicken breasts into big bite-size pieces, tossed them with the entire pack of Old El Paso taco seasoning in a zip-lock bag and baked for 15 minutes (with black bean and corn salsa on top).  Then added the cheese and crushed tortilla chips and baked for a oouple more minutes.  Served with Mexican rice and refried beans.  So very good!! Full of flavor, husband just loved it!

This has become part of our regular household menu.  You can also try this recipe in your slow cooker.  Just use the whole package of taco spices/seasonings and whole jar of salsa.  cook on low 6 hours or until chicken is done.  Top each breast with cheese before serving.

WOW!  I have never made a meal that was this easy that tasted this good.  I mean really.  THe chicken was done...juicy, and VERY tasty.  I was a little hesitant because my husband does not care for spicey foods but this was great.  I used medium salsa and coated the chicken he would eat lightly with the taco seasoning, and coated mine heavily and added jalapeno's on top of the sour cream on mine.  This is a perfect recipe.  Tasty, simple and very "pretty".  The red sauce, cheese, sour cream and jalapeno's (on mine) were so colorful that it looked GREAT on a plate.  I would serve this for company.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!  I would give it another star if I could.

This was a really good recipe. It was a little spicy for my kids but that can easily be adjusted. I added about 1/2 cup water to make more of a sauce and served it over white rice. Very good!

Pretty darned good.  I'd have given it four stars but it was so simple and easy that it deserved an extra star.  Protip: pound the chicken a little so that all of the pieces are about the same size.  This way they cook at the same rates.

Great recipe/idea. We also like it with green salsa verde, topped with white mexican cheese and chopped fresh cilantro before baking. Served with dolops of sour cream and guacamole.

I've made this before but in a crockpot. You add the chicken breast (4-6) in a crockpot, can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 the pack of taco seasoning (whole pack was too salty for my taste), one small jar of salsa of your choice.. Cook on low for 8 hrs, or high for about 4 hrs.. It's quick it's easy and I put it together before work and it's done when I come home..

Very good main dish. Simple and quick. I used chicken thighs instead of the boneless breasts and Rotel instead of salsa. Also added a lot more cheese. Served with spanish rice and black beans. Delicious! Was a hit with my own kids and their friends who were over for dinner. Thank you!

Like other reviewers have said, this really is surprisingly delicious.  I used Tyson frozen boneless breasts - I did not thaw them.  I used home-made taco seasoning (so much better than the store bought!).  I baked it at 375 for 50 min (since my chicken was still frozen) and then sprinkeled the cheese on and put it back in the oven for a couple of minutes while I finished my sides (white rice and peas).  Served with sour cream on top and it was amazingly tender and so good!

This is one of my favorite recipes to bring to potluck work parties. I usually skip the taco seasoning so it is VERY easy. Just salsa and cheese. For extra flavor I just buy the shredded taco flavored cheese.

I made no changes to this recipe. The chicken was tender and good. My suggestions would be to double the recipe and if you like spicy chicken use medium salsa or hot if you're daring, either way the chicken is great.

Delicious!  I made this in the crockpot using organic mild salsa and homemade taco seasoning mix.  Took all of 30 seconds to prepare.  Cooked all day and then served with cheddar cheese and sour cream on the dinner table so everyone could get as much as they wanted.  Made this with "quinoa and black beans", from this site, along with a sliced avocado.  All of the tastes blended perfectly together.

I think this recipe has possibilities.  It needed some help though.   The kind of salsa you use makes a world of difference.  Make sure it's a great tasting one as it definitely is the dominant flavor in this recipe.  I would try again and substitute the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe listed with All Recipes.  We used left overs to make burritos.

This recipe tastes so great and is very easy to make. I made sweet corn cake and mexican rice with it and everyone gobbled it up and asked for more! My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it.

So simple and so delicious.  This recipe turns out great everytime.  The chicken is always moist.  I never measure the salsa -- I just completely cover the chicken with it.  I told my mom about this recipe, and she tried it with pork chops.  My dad begs for salsa pork chops all the time now.

My husband actually requested this one again!  Last time, instead of salsa which I didn't have in the house at the time, I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead and it came out great!  I put half a pkg of taco seasoning in a bag and toss the chicken to coat on all sides.

Excellent and quick. For a delicious added addition, try garnishing with the Pico de Gallo from Paula Stotts on this site.Its also good served on a shallow bed of refried beans.

My boyfriend is Mexican and he absolutely loved the flavor of this dish and said it was the most authentic I have ever made!  Although this recipe is perfect, I added a few additional ingredients to give it more kick for my personal tastes. Before I put the chicken in the pan, I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I then added about 12-15oz jar of green salsa for my salsa contribution.  Then I cut about 8 small red potatoes into wedgies and placed them around the chick in the salsa.  I also sprinkled fresh cut cilantro and 1 tsp of cumin over the top. I covered with tinfoil and cook 45 min to allow potatoes to soften.  It was not only yummi but the potatoes and chicken simmer in this salsa base so there is extra for topping! YUMMI!  Try it...you won't be dissapointed!  Take the tinfoil off about 5 min before it's done to let some of the moisture evaporate.

This has been a standby favorite for several years.  I give it five stars for it's simplicity and versatility.  Use your favorite seasoning mix (I use Taco Seasoning I recipe), your favorite salsa, and your choice of cheese.

Made this last week for my husband and picky son.  Son didn't have any because he wasn't feeling well but has asked me to make it again because it smelled so good.  My husband quite liked it as well.  I found that there wasn't enough salsa to cover the chicken so will need to add more next time.  My friend made it the same week and shook seasoning with chicken in a zipper bag and she said it was great like that (more evenly coated with seasoning).  Might try it that way next time (this weekend!).  Looks like it's going to be a staple in our house!    Lucyfrog - Hamilton, Canada  UPDATE:  I make this quite regularly now, and the kids (big & small) can't get enough of it!  I've given the recipe to many family and friends and they all LOVE IT!

It should be illegal that something this easy and fast to make tastes SO GOOD!  :)  Was good with sour cream or without.  I like the fact that you can alter the "heat" according to personal tastes by using milk, medium or hot salsa.  A great recipie.  Thanks!

I made this for a luncheon and everyone loved it. I used medium salsa and served it over egg noodles. I accidently left it the oven after putting the cheese on for 15 minutes instead of 5 and it was still juicy!

No taste except taco seasoning and salsa. save time and money, put taco sauce in salsa and heat it up and you will have the same results.

So easy & good. I did what one of the reviewers said & put the taco seasoning in a ziplock bag with the chicken to coat it. We really liked it.

really enjoyed this recipe! The only thing I changed was I cut up the chicken to 4 oz serving sizes and used a 1/2 packet of the taco seasoning. I threw the seasoning and chicken in a bag so that it would coat the chicken without getting fingers dirty. Added salsa and threw in the oven for 20-25 min. Served with some yellow rice. Will def make again.. and it's so easy!

This was by far a wonderful chicken recipe. Unlike most leave the chicken pretty bland. I followed the recipe like it says, EXCEPT, I slow cooked it. I let my boneless chicken breast thaw overnight and in my crockpot I poured a thin layer of Salsa (Pace), then I put the chicken in a ziplock w/Taco Seasoning and made sure the chicken was coated well. Laid it out in crockpot, added Rotel - let it cook for about 4 hrs, turn the crock pot off.... then add cheese, and blk olives. Leave the top on crock pot while you cook sides. I served my dish with Mexican Rice, and Mexican Corn. As folks made their plate, they added sour cream on top of the chicken. Delicious! I will forsure make this again! Very easy and Yes it makes your house smell wonderful! :) Everyone LOVED it!

Just like almost everyone says - this recipe is so easy and tastes really good - it would even be good shredded and used in burritos, etc.  Glad I finally got around to making this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

4 stars because I didnt make this EXACT recipe.  I made a similar recipe I saw on TV.  Make a pocket in the chicken breast and fill it with refried beans.  Follow this recipe and add crushed tortilla chips ontop of the cheese.  Bake 30mins.

SOOOOOO Good!

This is very good and so easy to make. In the summer time i will throw the chicken on the grill. The only thing I do different with this recipe is throw in some black beans in the salsa mixture.

This was very yummy and very easy. We served it with the Quinoa and black beans recipe found on this website- which was a great side dish for this recipe. Will be making this again.

OOOOh, my happy chicken breasts!!!! This is soooo goood! Yummy. I had this in the oven, stirred together the zaterans spanish rice, and then in a smaller pan mixed sweet corn with red, and green peppers cut up in it. Then I had 15 minutes to relax. WOW try this. oh, I cut the recipe in half, sprinkled it with soul seasoning instead of taco seasoning, and used thick and chunky HOT salsa.  Geeze, I wish I had someone to share this with.

I think the difference between people who liked this and people who didn't comes down to your taco seasoning and your salsa. Use varieties you like, and really you're best off using homemade salt-free taco seasoning for this or else I could see it just being too much everything (mostly salt). We enjoyed this a great deal (did not use optional sour cream, that's quite enough dairy in the cheese!) but that would've been lovely. This was by far the most tender baked chicken dish I have ever made (barring the olden days when I baked chicken breasts in condensed soup!). The only drawback was that some of my cheese did not fit on my chicken, so it sort of fell off, and then no one would eat it because it got sort of...chicken-juiced and too wet in the bottom of the dish. So I'll reduce the amount of cheese I use next time, so that I waste none :) Thanks for this easy, tasty, and attractively-plateable recipe.

Great dinner and super easy!  My husband and two sons loved it.  It would be fun to try with some flavored salsas.  I'll have to do that the next time.  Thanks for a recipe simple enough for me to throw together after working all day.

It's a good day when both husband AND child like a new recipe. This was a success for me. I had to make my own taco seasoning(chili powder, cumin, garlic and onion powder,salt and paprika).I also used 2% colby/jack, since it was all I had. It came out beautifully. Thanks!

Delicious!  My 12-year-old daughter made this for dinner tonight, with a little coaching from me.  I had her cut the chicken up into bite-sized pieces to make serving and eating it a bit easier which made the cooking time about 10 minutes shorter, but otherwise we followed the recipe exactly.  We used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from here at AR instead of store-bought taco seasoning.  I didn't have any sour cream to garnish it with, but I'll definitely make sure to have some next time we make this.  Thanks for a new dinner added to our rotation!

Delicious and it couldn't be easier! I made the recipe as written, using only three chicken breasts. Mine took the full 35 minutes to cook as they were thick chicken breasts. I used reduced- fat sharp cheddar cheese and fat free sour cream to top it off. My hubby and 6-year old ate theirs sliced and wrapped in tortillas. I ate mine as is. The chicken was juicy and spicy. My little guy gave it five stars...something he doesn't do too often! Thanks for posting! *****Update****** 2/17/09 I just made this in the crock pot and it was delicious! I used 4 boneless chicken breasts and rubbed them with the taco seasoning. I put them in the crock pot, poured the salsa over them and also poured in about half a cup of water. I cooked on low for 4 hours, took them out and sliced them into strips and put them back in for another 30 minutes. I served them on tortillas with shredded jack cheese and sour cream. My six-year old gobbled his up and then ate half of mine!!!

Love this recipe!  I use less sodium taco seasoning mix and the result is great!  No other changes necessary, this is fantastic! I have also made this with tilapia and the results are equally as delicious.

EXCELLENT!!!  WOW! This was so GOOD! I cant beleive that flavor came form such a simple recipe!  And it was so tender I could cut it with a butter knife! YUM!! I also used a whole packet of taco seasoning and let the chicken marinade in it and  a bit of water for about an hour. Then put it in a 8x8 pan with the other ingredients!  Will defiantly make again soon!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband would like me to give this a 10! It was really very good,and moist. I seasoned the chicken with the taco seasonsing and then marinated it in the salsa in a plastic zip bag for about 1 hr. I added the sour cream on top before serving and that really did make it yummy! A good addition would be black olives(if you like them) and maybe some cilantro.Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  My family loved it also!  It was so easy, and I told my brother about it on the phone and convinced him to make it last night also.  I chopped up some fresh tomatos and seasoned them with chilli powder and a couple other spices to add to the top just for a little extra, but it wasn't needed by any means.

This did not taste good at all. Don't like the taco seasoning on chicken; I'll stick to using it with ground beef.

I made this last night, I only had the frozen chicken tenders, so I used them instead of breasts and I forgot the cheese, but it was absolutely delicious.  I used a little bit less taco seasoning (only because I never use the whole package when making taco's) and it added just that extra flavor that the salsa wouldn't have had!  I made Mexican Rice (from this site) and canned corn to go along with it.  This is an absolute easy meal and a real keeper!!!

Thank You Faye!

Easy, tasty, good.  If I have thick pieces, I salt the chicken a bit before shaking with the taco seasoning.  I use a whole pack of seasoning (we like things spicy) and enough picante sauce to insure there will be good gravy.  I've used thighs and breast...both turned out great.  I usually serve this with corn or black beans, rice (for the gravy!) and cornbread.  Can't go wrong!

I marinated my chicken in a mixture of lime juice, canola oil, and taco seasoning, so I didn't sprinkle taco seasoning on the chicken.  Then I baked it as directed, except I used a Salsa Jack cheese that was absolutely delicious.  My family said it was a little too heavy on the salsa, so I'd use just a tad less.  Otherwise...delicious!  Marinating it definitely added tons of flavor.

Easy and delicious! I didn't grease my pan, no need to. Used chicken tenders. Have also used skinless chicken thighs. Made as written otherwise, and we loved it-I passed the recipe to my family and friends!  Can use less or no taco seasoning as the salsa imparts lots of spicy/saltiness anyway. Sour cream adds that needed cool creaminess to round out the dish, I topped with the cheese and sliced green onion and passed extra salsa too. We had Mexican rice and tossed salad with it.

Rave reviews from my husband and daughter on the flavor of this dish, and a request to make it often. I cooked this in my slow cooker, which turned out great. And I used my own taco seasoning with cumin and garlic powder.

I've made this recipe several times now. It's so good and easy. We love Mexican dishes and this is a nice variation to have. I make exactly as says except I use nearly one whole packet of spice for 4 chickens, covering both sides. Then I use almost a full jar of salsa. I always serve with Spanish rice and cornbread. It's one of my husband's favorite dishes. Thanks for sharing!

This was great. I cut the chicken into strips before baking so we could put them in tortillas. I also shook them in a bag to coat them with taco seasoning, which really helped get the flavor into every bite. I used medium green salsa, which was tasty, and I added onions and red peppers to the baking dish. I served this with Spanish Rice. Very yummy! Will make again.

For those looking to economize and stretch the leftovers, this recipe is it!  Are you compressed for time and need a quick meal for a week night that has good taste, can easily be modified to be as spicy as you'd like, and leftovers can be used in a multitude of ways such as chicken enchiladas, chicken tortilla casserole, etc?  Well folks, as the number of reviews will attest, look no farther as this is it!  Thanks for the recipe Faye.

I decided I wanted rice, so. I added 1 c dry rice and 2 c chicken broth to the bottom of the 9 x 13 ( I used glass). Then I followed the recipie exactly, and everything turned out excellent!!!!  The rice was such a rich and flavorful delight, with all the chicken juices and cheese baking in. Yum!

Such a wonderfully simple and quick recipe, and everyone loved it and requested it again. Great recipe for last minute using things you're likely to have on hand! I used half of the taco seasoning, and found that it still had great flavor.

I am always looking for new low carb recipes and I find I'm quite disappointed with most.  I made it exactly as is and found it to be a pretty good low carb option.  It is so quick and easy to make especially if you are running around with kids all day and then are scrambling for something to cook at the end of the day.  My kids won't eat it but that's okay, they are extremely picky and I didn't expect them to from the get-go but it is definitely something I would make again.

The flavor was really good. Next time I will pound my chicken breasts thinner so it cooks better. I added black olives and tortilla strips to the top. Thanks for a great recipe!

So easy and so yummy! My husband loved it! I used a full package of taco seasoning and put it in a gallon Baggie to fully coat the chicken. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and topped with green onion and sour cream. Delicious!

The recipe as written is great. Like many reviewers I have been making this for years. One time when making it I found my chicken breasts varied greatly in size so I cubed them all to about 1.5 inches each. This worked out great as the salsa and taco seasoning had more surface area to absorb into. If you do the same make sure to watch your cooking time as it will be less with the smaller pieces.

Delicious and easy recipe!  I marinated the chicken in the taco seasoning a few hours before putting together and then dredged the chicken in panko bread crumbs (to add more calories because I'm an American) before covering with Pace salsa (is there really any other kind?).  Other than throwing in a drained small can of sliced black olives with the cheese for the final few minutes, I pert near followed the rest of the recipe as is...yee haw and darn tootin' this is a keeper!

I used turkey breast tenders instead of chicken and they came out great.  I also made my own taco seasoning with the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site.  I rubbed the seasoning all over the turkey, generously coating each piece.   I used El Pato jalapeno salsa which has a really nice, authentic flavor.  The turkey cooked for about 33 minutes and came out super juicy.

Very tasty and a quick supper for a weekday! Yet could easily serve this meal for company too! Such a nice way to do a Mexican flavored chicken dish.  The family all loved it and said they would love to have it again. Followed the recipe using homemade taco seasoning and homemade salsa.  Served it with Spanish rice, corn, and a salad. Garnished the chicken breasts with sour cream, chopped cilantro, chopped avocado and extra salsa sauce on the side. Delicious!

Great! I changed it up a bit by cutting chicken breast into tender size, adding to a zip-loc bag and shaking with an entire package of taco seasoning.  Baked in the oven as directed with salsa and cheese.  I served over some crushed taco chips, topped with fresh cilantro and a squirt of Sriracha sauce.  Yellow rice and black beans  YUM

Just made it.  Super simple, my 13 year old threw it together.  My husband said "I want this for my birthday.  And Valentine's Day.  And Martin Luther King Day.  And Easter...."!!

Our salsa turned to liquid, so I was glad to have extra salsa to serve it with.

Really quick and easy, and for that alone this recipe gets 5 stars.  I didn’t measure anything and probably used more taco seasoning than called for.  I put the chicken breasts in a plastic bag along with the taco seasoning and shook it up to lightly coat the chicken on all sides.  I spooned the salsa over the chicken completely covering it.  I baked mine for 25-30 minutes, topped with cheese and returned them to the oven just for another minute or two.  I served this with Mexican Rice III, also from this site.  Great dinner!

This was awesome and so easy to make.  Kids and adults enjoyed it.  Only thing different that I did was use chicken tenderloins for faster cooking.  In one hour, I went to store for ingredients and had dinner on the table.  Can see this in the midweek rotation.

I make this with a single change. I mix the Taco Seasoning with greek yogurt and marinate the chicken in that for an hour before cooking. I also dress up the sour cream with a bit of lime juice and a spoon of taco seasoning.

Had the grandkids(4) over for dinner.. from 4yr to 14yr.. They didn't think the dish looked good, but said they'd try it..  After a small taste, all asked for seconds, some wanted thirds..  They all decided they wanted to take the recipe home to "mom"..  Cooked 6 thighs.. none left..  served with tortillas, black beans, corn and rice...  All Gone!   I'll keep this recipe for future use..  BTW... I didn't get any!

I made a marinade with 1/4 cup each of canola oil and lime juice and left the chk to marinate for a couple of hours. Added the salsa, mixed and baked.  Served over rice and spooned the salsa mix over the whole thing then topped with sour cream...so easy and soo good!  Thanks Faye!

This was DELICIOUS. I used 4 skinless bonless chicken breasts, chopped them in half, then followed the directions exactly. The exception is that I didn't measure out the salsa, cheddar, or sour cream. 

I then put the chicken on a bed of Spanish rice and needless to say, it was very pleasing to the tastebuds. Easy and quick to make without a ton of ingredients, easily make this a favorite, especially for a beginning cook like myself!

I think this would have been better with cheese, but cannot it cheese due to dietary restrictions. Used one of my favorite fresh salsas, but was not what I had hoped.

Very tasty.  Even my 2 and 6 year old ate it.  I accidently used enchilada sauce mix instead of taco mix...and it was still very good.  I have made this several times.  I usually serve it with the mexican rice recipe off this site.

I looooved this meal.  I took the advice of others and put some taco seasoning in a bag and shook the chicken pieces to coat (we didn't find it too spicy at all).  I put a thin layer of salsa down in the 9x13 dish, and then placed the coated pieces on top of it.  I eyeballed the amount of salsa and ended up using about half of a mild Pace salsa bottle (which was very tasty).  At 25 minutes the chicken was at 165 (I had thin breast tenders).  I put shredded sharp cheddar cheese (also eyeballed, but it was probably about a cup or cup and 1/2) on the dish and cooked for a few minutes more.  I topped with sour cream (def would make sure to have sour cream).  It was tender and delicious.  I made Tortillas II and some quick spanish rice.  Wonderful meal - this will definitely be in my permanent rotation because it's so quick and easy and yummy!

I made this last night. It was delish! The only thing i would suggest is to be sure your chicken breast are not too thick. I used pretty thick breast and it was not as flavorful as it could have been, but overall it was very tasty and it will definitely be a staple in my home! Thanks for sharing :)

Super easy recipe but it tastes like you spent much more time.  No need to change a thing.  I see all the custom recipes, but honestly...why make a simple thing more complicated when it is not needed.  I even served this to our dinner group and they all begged for the recipe. It is a standard at our house.  I like to serve it with sour cream and guacamole along with rice and beans.

This was just okay for me. I cooked it in the crock pot and followed the directions of other reviewers who said it was amazing. Kinda reminded me of cafeteria food. It would be 3.5 stars. It was fine. Not good or bad. It was a dinner on the table. Won't make it again. One thing I did like was the Taco Seasoning in a baggie to coat the chicken. I think I would do that again on chicken cubes, make skewers and then bbq them for a mexican flavoring. Salsa chicken was fine. Nothing great!

Excellent as written.  I didn't change a thing.  Served it over black beans and it did not need sour cream.

Great recipe! Made this tonight for the family and it was a huge hit! The only thing I did different was add a couple slices of avocado to the top as a garnish!

Even better when you  marinade for at least 2 hours in tequila and lime juice, add a few tbls. of olive oil, and then top off with a few strips of bacon at the end!!!

I've been making a variation of this dish for my family for the last 10 years, but I stir honey in with the salsa.  It's always a hit!  I'm going to have to try adding the taco seasoning next time I make it.

I didn't have any taco seasoning, so I just seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cumin. Poured salsa on top and baked. It was really good, but nothing really special either. Will make again, but not exactly sharing it with all my cooking buddies.

very good chicken salsa! Simple and easy to prepare. I marinated the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag with taco seasoning and a little water (1/4cup) for about 6 hours. The baking time took an extra 15 minutes for the three chicken breasts. I used mexican blended cheese to top off the chicken with. I served this with "spanish rice original", from this website. This was a pretty tasty meal, everyone loves salsa, chicken and cheese. An easy meal to put together on a busy weekday night. My family says this dish tastes like enchiladas only without the tortillas. A great recipe that I will add this to my recipe box.

This is a really great weeknight meal. It's not something I would serve for company, but it's quick, easy and satisfying. I used half Cheddar cheese and half Pepperjack cheese for a little extra kick.

Quick, easy.  Added jalapenos to a couple pieces and did as another member posted and put some of the salsa in the pan before laying the chicken in.

This recipe is so easy yet so delicious. The chicken always comes out so juicy. Mmm. I just sprinkled a little taco seasoning on each chicken breast, both sides and put on some tostitos salsa. And some colby jack shredded cheese.

This is a fantastic, easy to make chicken recipe. This chicken had just the right amount of spice and flavor, without being overpowering. The chicken was cooked perfectly moist and tender. Throw some Mexican style rice on the side and you have one of my new favorite meals!

This was an awesome way to change up our usual 'Mexican themed' dinner.  Paired with Mexican Rice II and Buffy's Refried Beans from this site, some tortillas and sour cream on the side, it made for a wonderful meal.   Thank you Faye, for a great recipe.

I usually don't give bad reviews, but this was just not very good.  My boyfriend, who is the nicest man on the planet, could only say, "it is just nice to have a home-cooked meal."  I liked all the ingredients, but together they just didn't do anything special.

Five stars for being good and so, so easy!  Perfect for a busy weeknight.  I covered mine with foil for 40 minutes, cooked uncovered another 10, added cheese and cooked 5 more minutes.  Great served with Spanish style rice and black beans!

This was incredibly easy and delicious! The only things I did differently were use fajita seasoning since that's all I had on hand, and I rubbd the chicken breasts with olive oil before seasoning them. Came out fantastic.

this was tasty.  i used the marinade option, mixing 4T of taco seasoning and 2/3 cup water and letting our 2 chicken breasts sit in it for about 60-90 minutes.  instead of oven baking it, i cooked this dish in a skillet on the stove (oven baked chicken always takes longer than the recipe, it seems to me).  used a T or 2 of olive oil and put in about 1/4 cup of the marinade as well as the chicken, covered and simmered for about 20 minutes.  i added the salsa in for the final 5-10 minutes and then sprinkled cheese on top as it was served.  husband said it was good, it was tender and spicy enough that i wish we hadn't been out of sour cream.  good recipe :)

WOW! This recipe was really good!!! I went through some of the reviews and took advice from a few. I used 1 pkt of Taco Bell taco seasoning and 2/3 cups water to make a marinade. I then put that and the chicken in a plastic bag to coat well and marinade overnight. I used a crock-pot to cook the chicken...thin layer of salsa on bottom and another layer over the chicken. I cooked it 6hours on low. I had to use a large spoon to take the chicken out, it was THAT tender!! We then added cheese and salsa, fantastic!! The leftovers were even better. Only negative (small one at that) is that there is so much salsa left over, it would be nice to find a use for it. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

This is such an easy... yet such a great dish. My husband just loved it. So did I. I used the taco seasoning like a rub and then sauted the chicken in butter. I poured homemade salsa on top and let the juices run around the chicken. I covered the top of the wok in alluminum foil to keep the steam from escaping and let it steam about 8 minutes. The chicken was so tender and juicy. I made white rice in vegetable stock and served the chicken on top. I also served a fresh salad sprinkled with a little taco mix. The taco mix gave the salad a great taste, and we didn't need any dressing which saved calories. I also served a vegetable on the side. This was truly such a wonderful meal. My husband requested it again the next day! because I sauted it in the wok instead of baking it the taste was a little richer. The butter added to the taste and the sauce it created was wonderful on the rice. (Edited April 21, 2011... I regularly use Rotel instead of salsa... which is usually homemade... but I would note that if you use rotel instead of the salsa you should dice up some onions to add since it better resembles a salsa in the end)

A very simple yet delicious dish. Since I was only cooking for myself, I made one serving. What I did differently was I tried following other members' advice and I put the chicken in a bag with the taco seasoning and shaking it to coat. The coating kept falling off I emptied the seasoning on a plate and pressed the chicken onto it. This worked really well.

Then, I cut a large square of aluminum foil and put a shallow layer of medium salsa on the bottom, which I then placed the chicken on. I poured a thicker layer of salsa on top of the chicken and folded the foil around to create a pocket. Then I placed it in a pan incase of spills.

I cooked it for 25 minutes and then unfolded the foil and left the top bare to sprinkle cheese on and then I put it back into the oven this way for five minutes. I only had smoked cheddar but it still tasted great.

The chicken came out tasty and moist. The taco seasoning you use plays a large role in the taste. I used hot and spicy Old Del Paso. It wasn't too bold.

A lot of bang for the easy prep. Amazingly easy to make. I didn't change a thing and everyone loved it.

This is a great recipe and definitely a keeper!!

UPDATE: I've made this a couple of times now and my favorite variation is to use Ortega salsa verde in place of the regular salsa. To me, that gives it the PERFECT punch. I don't even top it with anything else.

Wonderful taste and super easy! I let the chicken cook about 20 minutes with just the taco seasoning so it could brown a little. Then spooned the salsa on for the last 10 minutes. Hubby even loved it and he is finicky about his chicken! Served with some Mexican rice, refried beans and flour tortillas.

I was really pleasantly surprised by this.  I figured I'd try it for something new because we are on a Salsa kick.  I wasn't expecting much!  We loved it!!  I made it almost like the recipe.  I used a Taco Seasoning packet in a ziploc and did the chicken like Shake n Bake.  I used Fresh Salsa (hate jarred) and used a LOT!!!  Completely covered the chicken (remember I said we're on a kick)!!  I also didn't measure the cheese and covered it.  It was GREAT!!!  Definitely a do again!!  Thanks!

Quick, easy and tasty!  I followed others' suggestions and marinated the chicken before baking. Covered the bottom of the pan with a little bit of salsa also. Served over a bed of the Best Spanish Rice recipe found on this website.

I was stunned at how great this tasted, especially considering how simple it is to make!  You can throw this together in the time it takes to remove a TV dinner from the freezer and stick it in the oven.  This is truly 'stress-free' cooking as it can be scaled up or down with ease.  I just put a generous sprinkling of the taco seasoning on both sides of the chicken and poured on enough salsa to cover the top of each chicken piece.  Ditto for the cheese.  The chicken comes out so moist and flavorful.  I am not a big fan of rice, so I serve this with refried beans and frozen corn.  Delish!!!  Don't be fooled into thinking it can't possibly be good because it has so few ingredients.  This stuff rocks!!  For me, the sour cream is required, though.  It mellows the whole thing out and makes it that much richer tasting.

This was a great recipe.  It used ingredients that I already had on hand and the chicken came out nice and moist.  Our homemade salsa went really well with the taco seasoning.  The only change we made was to use a whole cut-up chicken rather than the chicken breasts.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Wow - incredibly easy and very delicious!  I like that I was able to adjust the seasoning on one piece of chicken to accomodate my 7 year olds taste without compromising the rest of the dish. Thanks for sharing!

we've been eating this forever and it's a staple--so easy and fast and all the ingredients are always on hand! we usually cut the chicken into small pieces, coat in taco seasoning, put in a casserole, throw on some salsa, cook 10-15 minutes, then add mexican cheese (just a grocery store mix) and crushed tortilla chips and throw back in the oven to melt the cheese. serve with broccoli and refried beans, and it's superb.

This was soooo delicious!! Before cooking, I "stabbed" chicken with knife to make sure all flavors got into it, then placed chicken into a ziploc bag with half a packet of mild taco seasoning, along with about a 1/8 cup of water. I let sit in refrigerator about an hour before cooking, i then followed the recipe, except i didnt have shredded cheddar cheese, so on each breast i just placed half of a slice of kraft cheese, with some shredded mozzarella cheese. I served it with some white rice. this turned out great and i will definitely be making it again. thank you for such a great recipe :]

Extremely easy and tasty. I think the main thing is to use a salsa you like. Everyone liked it. I will be doing this again! Thanks for this easy delicious recipe!! *****UPDATE**** This has become one of my "emergency" dishes. Everyone likes it, uses items I have on hand, easy and quick. Can't beat that!!

Yummy!  To make it a bit more of a meal, I cooked down 2 8 oz packages of mushrooms and then sauteed 1 sliced red  and 2 small red peppers and put the veggies in the bottom of the pan.  Placed the chicken and salsa (as per original) over the veggies to bake.

This was SO yummy!  And I cooked this on the stovetop, in a skillet instead.  I only had the quick frozen chicken breasts and started them out in the skillet, sprayed with cooking spray.  Put the lid on for about 5 minutes, then sprinkled the taco mix on top.  Covered for a couple minutes more, then added the salsa.  Put lid on again another 10 minutes or so, simmering low.  Then turned up to high, lid off to reduce the sauce.  Turned heat off, topped with cheese, lid back on for a min. to melt the cheese.  Served the sauce over the rice!  SO GOOD!  Even the kids liked it.

I tried this recipe in the crock pot, and my family loved it.  I sliced the breasts into strips, put them in the crock, sprinkled a packet of taco seasoning on top, then covered it all with salsa.  I also added corn and black beans to the pot to round out the meal. I cooked it on low all day.  It smelled so good when I came home!  Right before serving, I added the sour cream and cheese, and served rice with it.  It's definitely going into our meal rotation.

So unbelievable simple and very yummy.  The leftovers didn't last long.  I used more taco seasoning than the recipe called for --- I used a whole packet for 4 large boneless, skinless pieces of chicken.  I put the seasoning in a bowl and patted both sides of the chicken pieces in the seasoning before putting them in the pan.  I also used Roberto's medium salsa, which added a very tasty heat.

Good recipe!  We try a new chicken recipe almost every week, and this was my husband's favorite so far.  I rubbed fresh garlic on the chicken before adding the taco seasoning.  I served this with refried beans and Spanish rice.  Next time I think I will use hot salsa, just for a little extra kick.  Thanks!

"WOW! This is REALLY good!" That was the response my 16 year old son gave as he took the first bite of this chicken dish. I have to say, it is soooo easy and delicious, but looks like you've worked more than the 5 minutes it takes to make it. I used the idea of putting the chicken and taco seasonings into a plastic bag to coat the chicken. Much easier and neater. I used Pace medium salsa and pepper jack cheese vs cheddar cheese. I added a little more than the recommended amount of salsa for enough to put it over the white rice. Your choice. I highly recommend this one to everyone!

Super easy weeknight supper!  Here's a tried and true tip: Cut the chicken breasts into thin strips; put in a ziploc bag with seasoning; seal and shake; add salsa; marinate for a few hours or overnight; Follow the rest of the recipe.  I suggest making spicy rice and corn as sides.  For easy lunches the next day or another quick weeknight dinner, mix the leftover chicken, rice, and corn together; microwave, and serve in warmed flour tortillas!  YUM!

I love this recipe!!  It is so easy to make. I cut the chicken breasts in to strips and cut the baking time a little and it's awesome. I fix with the baked corn recipe that I found on this site. Thanks Faye..

This is so quick, easy and tasty! I put put the whole thing together using frozen chicken, placed it in the fridge and when I got home I just put it in the oven. Great for weeknights.

I made this dish for my parents last night & WOW! It was a hit!  I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was! My dad couldn't resist seconds!  I rubbed both sides of the chicken generously with taco seasoning, used Hot salsa, and used Kraft Mexican blend shredded cheese. It turned out great! Very attractive dish! I will definitely be making this again!

I added cilantro to my jar of salsa(tastes like homemade)I also added Jalapeno peppers on top of the cheese.  Baked for a 1/2 hr and served it with sour cream and guacamole.  Thanks Faye:)

Over 200 "five star" reviewers couldn't be wrong, could they?  Nope!  This dish was absolutely delicious and easy to make.  You can make this as spicy or mild as you like, depending on which salsa you use.  I splurged and topped the chicken with sour cream and sliced avocado after cooking.  Those two "cool" ingredients seemed to complement the heat from the salsa I used.  A real winner!  YUM

This was a VERY easy recipe and turns out tasty.  I would lighten up on the seasoning though, it can be a little too much.

My husband and I did not care for the taco seasoning mix on the chicken.  If I make this again, I will only use salsa on the chicken and then add the cheese.

Attention:  If you are a man and would like to impress a woman with your cooking abilities then this is the recipe for you. Not only is in easy to make but it only uses a few dishes so clean up is easy. It rated two thumbs up and a kiss from my wife and I’m sure the same will happen for you. Sorry I could only rate this with 5 stars. Enjoy and happy eating.

Very tasty, the chicken was really tender and the seasonings were great. Didn't use taco seasoning like suggested, just added various spices and a lot of hot salsa!

I've made a variation of this recipe for a while now, and it's delicious!  I use one jar of salsa and pour a little on the bottom of the pan before I lay the chicken down- since it can simmer in the juices I think it gives it more flavor and tendernes.  I also slice some green peppers and onions and spread them over the chicken before I cover it with cheese.  Easy, everyday gourmet!

Very easy and delicious recipe!  I have made it twice - first by the exact recipe.  Second time, I added 3/4 c. raw rice to the bottom of the pan, stirred in 1+ tsp. of taco seasoning and poured in approximately 1 1/2 cups chicken broth.  I then laid the prepared chicken on top. Covered with foil and baked 45 min.  Uncovered to melt cheese.  YUM!!

This chicken was soooo good and I can't believe how easy it was.  I chopped onions into large pieces and added them to the top and used slightly more salsa than it called for.  The chicken was moist and very tasty.  Served with spanish rice and mexican cornbread.

This chicken was great! I was very impressed at how tender and juicy it came out. I served it with yellow rice with black beans and assorted peppers mixed in. This recipe couldn't be easier to make. We will certainly be making this again! Next time I make it we will try the suggestion of putting it all in a tortilla.

This is one of our favourite weeknight dishes.  We add 1 cup of rice and 1 3/4 cups water in bottom of casserole dish with chicken on top and bake for an hour.  That way it is a one dish meal.

Super fast and easy.  You can use this recipe and change of brands or heat intensity of the chicken to suit your palate. For best results, I would either pound the chicken breasts a little thinner or use breast tenderloins. Enjoy!!

I had to find something quick and easy to make, and this fit the bill. My kids like chicken, cheese and salsa, although we have never tried all together; they were complaining as it was in the oven that it didn't sound good and they weren't going to like it. And then it was gone! So they didn't rave, but they ate it all, and I was told I didn't make enough, so that's pretty good in my book. Thank you...will def make again.

I make this recipe once a week! Its so easy and my whole family loves it. I sometimes replace the salsa with taco sauce. I add chopped black olives to the top, serve with a dollop of sour cream, salad and spanish rice. Its perfect for those busy weeknights!

This simple recipe is easy and mouth watering delicious!!! That's 5 stars in my books. It comes together so quickly and is easily doubled or scaled down, depending on how many you're cooking for. I usually add extra salsa because I like to have some to spoon over the rice I serve alongside. Also extra cheese because, why not??!! This has quickly become one of my go to recipes and it's a definite hit!!

This is easy, quick and so good! I made as directed, only slightly pressing down on cheese a bit to make sure it didn't slid all off the chicken. I served it with Best Spanish Rice here on Allrecipes and some refried beans. A quick and delicious dinner!

This is a nice, easy, no fuss dinner.  I put out black olives, shredded lettuce,sour cream and queso for "toppers". We served it with brown rice and steamed veggies.  This was a hit with the teen boys in the house and made enough for lunches for hubby and I the next day.  Line your pan with aluminum foil to help clean up along!  Thanks for sharing.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. My wife is a PHENOMENAL cook! But, when it's my turn to cook, I try to match her abilities with simple ingredients. This dish allows me to meet that match! It's quick, easy and really good! I should have used a spicier salsa though. Next time...and there will be a next time!

This recipe was good as written. However I am one of those people that like to season my meat which is what I did before doing anything to the chicken. I used Mrs Dash so as not to increase the salt content which I know the taco mix would add. My hubby and son gobbled this up.

This was so easy! I used 6 chicken thighs with the skin on in a crock pot and sprinkled 1/2 pkg of the taco seasoning over added a 16 oz jar of salsa and 1/2 c water and let it cook 6 hrs on low. It fell off the bone and had great flavor. Added Mexican shredded cheese 5 minutes before serving.I didn't use the sour cream, but I'm sure that would have been a great topper. Served with Best Spanish rice and Mexican corn from this site.

Loved this recipe. I did use bone-in breasts because that was what was on sale. Will use boneless next time to make it easier to eat. Put on the seasoning and baked 1/2 hour, then added the salsa (Pace Picante sauce, actually) and baked another 1/2 hour. Then, added the cheese and baked another 15 minutes. The tomatoes actually caramelize a bit, and really enhances the flavor. So very simple, yet tastes amazing! Served with a side of re-fried beans (with salsa and cheese added), and broccoli.

This was a super easy recipe for a woman with a full time job that really hates cooking.  But I love salsa (I make my own)so thought I'd try it.  It was fantastic!!  I don't think I would sub anything, but I may precook the chicken just a little bit so that there wasn't so much liquid in the pan afterwards.  Great recipe!!  Thanks Faye!!

This was good. I think a lot has to do with the quality of salsa you use. I liked it, but my husband didn't (he doesn't like melted cheese) so I don't get to eat it very often, but I would make it again.

I make this same recipe, but in the slow cooker.  Chicken breasts, taco seasoning, salsa - cook for 6 hours and then I shred the chicken and we put it in taco shells with all the "fixins".  We call it, creatively enough, Yummy Taco Chicken.

Everyone in my house really enjoyed this dinner.  I put a little extra hot sauce & jalapenos on my husband's portion but kept the rest mild for myself and the kids.  I served it over Spanish rice and with some broccoli.I will definitely make this again.

This is the best salsa chicken I've ever made. I used the "Taco Seasoning I" from this website, instead of store bought, and fresh medium salsa. It had great flavor but was a little spicy for the kids (nothing a little sour cream couldn't fix). I added about a cup of reduced sodium chicken broth to the bottom of the pan at the beginning and then added some cooked brown rice during the last few minutes to soak up the broth. Amazing!!! Just had the left overs for lunch and it's even better the second time around. This recipe will be going into my normal weekday rotation. It was inexpensive and easy to prepare. I'll never make salsa chicken in the crock pot again. This was is much more moist!

I've made this recipe multiple times with a variety of "audiences" and everyone loves it!  It's simple to make and you can make versions of it in the same meal to spice it up/down depending on your guests/family members. I used fresh lime juice to squeeze over each chicken breast once on the plate, which added a nice tangy taste to the finish.

This was easy, had ingredients on hand. Made Fresh Tomato Salsa recipe from this site a couple days prior. It makes a large batch and this was an excellent use of it. Made Best Black Beans recipe for the side with rice. This was outstanding!   Will definitely be making it again.

So easy and sooooo Good.  The first time I made it, I forgot to add the sour cream and it was good.  We made it again the next day and added the sour cream and it was amazing.

Simple, easy, yummy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Thank goodness because I hadn't planned ahead!  The only change/addition I made was to sprinkle some crushed tortilla chips on top as suggested by another reviewer.  If I had not been short on time, I would have rolled the chicken in the chips. I served this with rice and corn.  1/2 the family ate it as is, the other half shredded it and rolled it in a tortilla along with rice, corn, salsa, and sour cream.  Delicious!

I made the recipe and didn't change a thing. It was very bland. Tasted like salsa (and I used a good salsa that my family loves) thrown on top of baked, very plain chicken. I wouldn't make this again. I don't even know what I would do to fix it.  A lot on here seem to have enjoyed it though.

This is one of my favorite ways to serve chicken and appreciated by many people.  Have also used the same ingredients for haddock and halibut.  This is one of those recipes that proves you do not have to have a lot of ingredients to make a very acceptable entree.

This is a great & simple recipe. I used a sweet mango salsa that complimented the spice of the taco seasoning nicely. It was a big hit with the family.

I have prepared this several times and it's always a hit! It's so simple and quick that I can make it even when it's been a tough day and have no complaints about dinner. My family cuts the cooked chicken it into pieces and eats it on flour tortillas. 5 star for sure

I love this recipe...it's fast and easy to make...not to meant my kids love it too, so that's a big plus. I didn't change a thing I made it exactly as it was written and it came out prefect. To complete the meal I made some cilantro lime rice. What a hit with my family I will be making this again.

This was a hit! I used five chicken breasts,,,added the whole packet of taco seasoning..medium Picante sauce...more cheese and used Mexican four cheese blend and added cut up green onions with the cheese for the last few minutes...and a squeeze of fresh lime before serving. On the side I made a Spanish rice with black beans and a salad with crushed tortilla chips and squeeze of lime before whatever dressing people like..yum..good meal!

For how easy this was, I was surprised at how tasty it ended up being with what I had. I had 4 chicken breast halves, packet of taco seasoning, a can of Zucchini with Italian Style Tomato Sauce, one tomato and one jalapeño. I basically drained the can's juices into my baking dish; drenched the chicken in the taco seasonings; placed the chicken into the baking dish; poured the zucchinis on top of the chicken; put the diced tomatoes and jalapeños I had on top of that; placed into the oven and called it day. I put one portion on top of quinoa and it made for one tasty meal! I'll do this again for sure! Thanks for the recipe which inspired a remix...

This was pretty tasty. I used shredded Mexican blend cheese because that's what I always buy. I opted not to use sour cream, but I imagine it would be good with it. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed 79SHALE97 suggestion and used Ro-Tel seasoned tomatoes with green chilis that are pretty seasoned for chilis recipies..also put my chicken breasts in a bag and did like a "shake a bake" coating the chicken in the taco seasoning completely and my husband and I loved it..so flavorful for such and inexpensive recipe...thank you for sharing!!

Delicious and really easy!  I had huge chicken breasts, and I was afraid they wouldn't cook evenly, so I diced them up into bite sized pieces, sprinkled the pieces with the taco seasoning, and poured the salsa over.  I stirred it while it was cooking, so the chicken was well coated and seemed to soak up a lot of flavor.  I made seasoned rice to go with it, rolled everything up in tortillas with sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes.  Delish!

I made this recipe exactly as directed.  The chicken had great flavor and was very moist, I even added a dollop of sour cream which enhanced the flavors.  My picky husband and 15mo old loved it too.  Easy to make and definitely worth trying!

Easy to do.  Use a can of diced tomatoes with chiles instead of salsa.   Husband like to make taco wraps out of it with the chicken, corn and rice.

Absolutely delicious recipe that's crazy easy to make. I'm new to cooking and this is something I love to make because it's pretty much idiot proof. Also really good if you use a specialty salsa - I like with pineapple salsa.

This was pretty good and really easy to make.  John and I definitely enjoyed it.  We're not really a fan of spicy food so I made sure to buy ingredients that didn't add spice to this (I was concerned that the taco seasoning would give it a bite so I got the one with cheese seasoning in it) but we really could have handled a little more spice.  I paired it with soy sauce mushrooms and a side salad and it was a very filling dinner.

Super easy, super tasty, what more can you ask for?  I made this as directed in the oven and it turned out great.  My one tip is that this gets really wet as written and your chicken ends up boiling instead of baking.  I am very careful to put the salsa on just the top of the chicken and I use a fork to get it out of the jar to get rid of some of the juice.  I pull it out of the oven a couple of times and soak up the juices with a paper towel to keep it dry.  This makes for a nicer finished product.

This was a quick and easy weeknight recipe. I added a can of petite diced tomatoes to the recipe and it tasted great. I served the chicken with Zatarains New Orleans Style Spanish Rice. I will make this recipe again.

If I could grasp the quality and quantity of time in the rest of my day as I was able to do with this recipe, I'd be superwoman! I was surprised how delicious and easy this was. My 13 year old girl and husband went back or 2nds AND 3rd's. I even got 2 "This is really good!" remarks from my husband who enjoys but rarely remarks on my cooking. I pretty much followed the recipe but normally add a little to suit my family's taste. My husband is Cajun so flavor and spice is a must.  I did add some grilled corn which I seasoned with butter, cayenne, cumin, pepper, and cilantro. (Which by the way was delicious by itself) and threw in on the chicken when I added the cheese. After reading the reviews, I will try it in the slow cooker next time. I took the advise on one reviewer and let the chicken rest and absorb the liquid by removing it from the pan when it was done cooking and covering it with foil for 10 minutes. It was incredibly tender for oven baked chicken. Thank you for this recipe! It will definitely be a regular for our house!!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was quick, super easy, and very tasty.  This is a great week night meal.  I used spicy salsa, and it definitely had a nice kick to it.  This goes wonderfully with the Quinoa and Black Beans recipe on this site.

I made this but i changed it a little. I rolled the chicken breasts in taco seasoning/taco sauce i used from a boxed dinner kit(was running short on supplies) then put the chicken in a baking pan that had a layer of corn and mushrooms. On top I layered diced green bell peppers and very chuncky salsa. when the chicken was almost done i put a layer of mexican cheese blend(so much better than plain chedder)on top,melted it until done. Served this with seasoned rice and soft taco shells. This was a huge hit with the family! The reason I give this a 5 star is because this recipe is a great starter recipe for those new to cooking. You can add or subtract to your liking or skill as you go along! Thank you Faye for sharing a great recipe!

I've been making a variation of this recipe for years, and it is a family favorite and frequent request. I add quite a few more items to my version, although the base recipe exactly as listed above is also delicious!

Here's my variation:

Cover chicken breasts with a dash of taco seasoning, plus some garlic powder, black pepper and (the secret ingredient) Cinnamon -- the cinnamon gives it a rich and slightly sweet flavor, which mixes very well with the other ingredients. I add just a pinch of cinnamon to almost all of my Mexican dishes.

Layer salsa (experiment with different varieties -- I have even used corn salsa before with great results). I will sometimes also add a thin layer of chile con queso if I have it on hand.

Crush up a few handfulls of corn chips and sprinkle on top, then add the cheese as directed in the base recipe.

You really can't go wrong, and this is a great recipe to experiment on!

This dish was a million times more amazing than I originally thought it was going to be.  I bought the chunkiest salsa that I could find (Pace Chunky salsa & La Victoria Thick and Chunky Salsa are both great).  When baking, it left large chunks of onion and peppers on the chicken which was awesome to bite into.  It also made the house smell so good while cooking.  My husband ranked this easy dish as the best chicken recipe that he has ever had...and he talked about it ALL night long!  We will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Chicken was very tender. I did not have taco seasoning so I just used cayenne pepper and black pepper. We used for tacos. I had uncooked Foster Farms breast tenders and only cooked for 25 mins.

If your looking for a quick and easy chicken recipe, this one is for you! My family loved it! I served it with rice but I wish I would have thought of re fried beans and possibly Mexican rice instead of white rice. I loved how in this recipe you just throw everything in a pan and let cook adding the cheese at the end. House smelled wonderful!

I made this because my husband is on a low carb diet.  It was very good, but I think it would be better with some refried beans....I found the texture a little lacking (and I hate Spanish rice, so I didn't have that haha.)  Maybe some fried tortilla strips, if you aren't avoiding carbs.

Yum!  So easy and quick, gotta love that!  I used Taco Seasoning I from this site instead of the package; so much better.  This turned out juicy and very flavorful.  Served with Best Spanish Rice and Black Bean & Corn Salad II from this site.  Oh, so good!  All of them together was time consuming, but this alone is quick, great for a weeknight meal.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice in one week now - it is SO simply delicious and crazy quick!  I only make a slight change and that's to combine the taco seasoning w/ a little bit of olive oil brush this on the chicken and then bake as instructed.  This is a quick dinner on those busy nights!

Very easy and quick.  You can control how spicy with the heat of the taco seasoning and the salsa.

This dish is really tasty.  While it is cooking, I like to saute strips of green peppers and onions in a little olive oil to add on top of it when it comes out of the oven.

easy and terrific.  I seasoned the chicken with spices I normally use on my taco meat instead of a packaged seasoning.  It was wonderful and I think saving the extras and shredding it for some enchiladas will be my next step:)

My family liked this chicken dish, but I wasn't that fond of it.  I sprinkled the taco seasoning on instead of shaking it in a bag out of fear that it would be too spicy that way.  I probably should have just taken my chances because it was very bland.  IF I make it again, I'll definitely be adding more taco seasoning and more salsa once it comes out of the oven.

I followed the recipe and used some of the suggestions of the other reviewers, by tossing the chicken breasts in the taco seasoning. Also, I was also generous with the salsa and instead of just using Cheddar cheese, I added a layer of smoked Swiss and even put Parmesan over it to make it extra cheesy. My boyfriend loved this dish and didn't want to share once he tasted it. :) This recipe is definitely going in the favorites!

I made this last night with boneless pork chops instead of chicken (it was on sale) and it was super good.  This was my only substitution. The husband raved about it and wants me to make it again.

This was great! I used Rotel instead of salsa. Also added jalapenos and dab of sour cream before serving. This one is going into rotation!

Absolutely wonderful and so easy to make.  I made it in the crockpot on high for 2 - 2.5 hours then on low for a couple of hours.  My boyfriend loved it.  What was left over I shredded and mixed into the sauce that was left over.  It would be great to make chicken burritos or chicken tacos.  Would even be great to make a chicken taco salad.  Will definitely make this recipe again.  Oh and I didn't use any cheese and it was still wonderful!

Faye, Thank you for a very tasty recipe. My husband dosn't care for chicken, I really like chicken, so I'm always looking for different ways to prepare it. I followed your recipe to a T. I used mild taco seasoning and coated the entire chix. breasts, I used mild salsa, and even used the taco blend cheese. It was not to hot, all the flavors blended in very nicely together. Thank you for a very delicious recipe that even my husband and two 8 year olds even enjoyed.

I love this recipe, my husband does also. I have made it for dinner parties and it is always a big hit. I use more salsa than it says, but that is just because I love salsa. Also, the first time I made it I didn't have taco seasoning at my house, I only had fajita seasoning, it was fantastic and hat is how I have made it every time. I give this recipe out every chance I get! I would highly suggest making it!

4.5 Stars: I put an entire packet on 3 breasts, added the salsa and let it sit overnight.  It's quick, tasty and would make great chicken taco filling.  A fresh avocado on top was the best part.

It's good but not a kid recipe.  None of my kids ate it and hubby just said it was "okay".  Think we will save the salsa for chips.

This was really good and so easy to make.  My husband loved it and asked me to make it again.  The second time I made it I forgot to buy sour cream and it wasn't as good. I also prefer Trader Joe's taco seasoning.

I love this!~! This is the only way we make our baked chicken ... served with a spanish rice, and a creamy cucumber salad. You cannot go wrong! Be sure to top with sour cream if using a "hot" salsa :) I've passed this on to others ... you won't be disappointed.

This is so good and incredibly easy to make! The only part of this recipe that takes any substantial amount of time (like more than 2 minutes) is cutting the fat off the chicken. I made the recipe exactly as it calls for and was quite impressed. I will definitely be making this again.

Made this for the first time last night - "Absolutely Delicious !!" ...per the recipe (though I may have been a bit overzealous with the salsa)  The Chicken comes out so very moist and tender after being cooked smothered in salsa...and simply bursting with flavor...just mouth watering - unbelievable just how easy it is to throw together - a definite keeper for sure !!!

I added about 1 cup of sweet corn and cooked this int he crockpot (low, 8 hours). I love how meat in the crockpot literally crumbles apart. I served this over white rice. If it weren't for the addition of sour cream and cheese I would've given it 2 stars. There just wasn't much flavor...perhaps it was because I cooked it in the crockpot? Either way, this was not a 4 or 5 star recipe for me like so many others think. Perhaps I'll try it once more in the oven. I thought it was bland.

Took me 2 minutes to put together. Used one packet of taco seasoning, dumped it in a ziplock bag then put 2 lbs of chicken tenders and shook it up. Placed a thin layer of picante sauce on the bottom of the crock pot, placed the tenders on top and arranged them evenly. Poured enough picante sauce to cover the chicken. Everything was eyeballed. Cooked it on high for 4 hours and the meat fell apart when we ate it. I forgot to add the cheese on top and didn't have any sour cream. It tasted great without it anyways. It's so easy that my lack-of-cooking-skills hubby could make it. However, he highly doubts that he could make something this tasty.

This is a great recipe that is now in my usual rotations because it is so easy and pretty healthy. I like to add black beans or green chili's for extra flavor.

I uased Sazon Goya con Culantro y achiote instead of taco seasoning, as I had none in the house. Otherwise followed the direction to a "t". Everyone loved it and my daughter wanted to drink the "soup". I'm not sure if the cheese was necessary. I don't think it added to the recipe.

This is so good &.easy to make! I made it using the Taco Seasoning1 recipe from this site and organic chicken tenderloins w/organic salsa. Baked it for only 25 mins. Served it with organic texmati rice and peas for a veggie. Also an avacado! My husband asked me to make again soon please! We both loved it,it will be a regular in our house.

A family favorite already! This is a really simple recipe when you want a flavorful, simple and healthy chicken dish. Goes well with rice and beans ... pretty much like a taco shop dinner but way healthier! A no-fuss, FAST dinner that's in rotation.

THIS WAS AMAZING. I found it while looking for low calorie dinners, and this was perfect. This chicken, the Best Spanish Rice recipe, and tortilla chips makes for a meal less than 500 calories! Rock!

This was a fast and very easy recipe!  My husband and I really liked it!  I used more taco seasoning (just sprinkled it on there until it covered the majority of the chicken on both sides and I used mozzarella cheese instead of Cheddar since that was all I had on hand.  Served it up with sour cream and some tortilla strips sprinkled over it and it was a great meal!  VERY fast and easy!  Perfect for a quick dinner!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish was fantastic! Instead of just sprinkling taco seasoning on the chicken, I dipped the chicken in bread crumbs mixed with taco seasoning. I also served the dish with guacamole.

My goodness, this was excellent!  I made the recipe exactly as written, except used Club House Tex-Mex seasoning on the chicken (not sure if it's the same as taco seasoning, but it's good).  If I have my way, I will make this again...the hubby hasn't had the pleasure of trying it yet as he's on afternoon shift, but I'm sure he'll love it too.  Thanks for the recipe - easy, inexpensive and very, very tasty!

I quickly seared the chicken breasts in a grill pan with the taco seasoning on them. Added 2 tbls of brown sugar and 1 tsp of yellow mustard to the salsa.  Baked for 45 min at 350 covered with foil.

Chick is VERY juicy & tender, plus simple to prepare. The taco seasoning mix gives it an unusual flavor, not bad just different. Will definately fix again:)

I've been making a similar version for years (and here I thought I made it up! LOL).  The only difference in my method was that I sprinkled the taco seasoning on the chicken breasts and then browned them before baking in salsa.  This way is just easier and you don't have the extra pan to wash.  Delicious and good for you!

I find bone in chicken has better flavor.  Used skinless thighs, cooked 45 minutes.  I was surprised to find how good it was.

This was quick, easy and very tasty. The only addition I made was sprinkling it with chopped cilantro after taking it out of the oven. I served it with Mexican rice, black beans, salad and tortillas.  I am cooking for a large crowd next month and will use this delicious and easy recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I've actually been  making a version of this for years.  However, I put the raw chicken in a ziplock back with the salsa and let it marinate overnight.  Never thought to use taco seasoning so I'll have to try that next time.

Tis is really good and really easy.  My husband loved it for dinner and ate the left overs for lunch the next day, said he came home early from fishing because he kept thinking about eating the leftovers for lunch.  While eating the leftovers he said "this is great, you should make this when we have company."  I really liked it also, plus it was simple & easy.  I served it with black beans and yellow rice.

This recipe is so tasty and easy!  The cheese will melt when you put it on when the chicken is done.  I have found it's not necessary for it to go back in the oven.  It's cooking in the oven right now and I have time to review the recipe - it's that easy!

Tasty, quick and easy.  I swapped chicken breast for chicken tenders and didnt measure the taco seasoning, but probably used a bit more than 4 teaspoons.  Paired this with corn casserole III for a terrific dinner!!!

For such a simple recipe, this wasn't too shabby. My husband loved it [he has "simple" tastes...;)], but I thought it was just alright overall. I think a homemade salsa (or pico de gallo with fresh tomato juice) would be better than the jarred variety I used my first time making this tonight. I wouldn't necessarily think of serving such a basic dish for company, but for a quick weeknight dinner, it wasn't bad. I bet it would be even better if the chicken was grilled. We will probably be making this again. Thanks!
EDIT - As it turns out, I found I liked this dish better as leftovers the next day. More time for the flavors to mingle.

This was fantastic! I took someone else's advice and dumped some salsa on the bottom of my baking dish and clean up was a breeze. I used a cinnamon sugar shaker to season the chicken with the taco mix. It applied the perfect amount. I also did what someone else said and covered the chicken once it was out of the oven with foil for 10 minutes to let the juices settle - never had such juicy chicken. Super easy and super delish! Thanks!

So easy to make and tastes great. I did not have cheddar cheese so I used 4 Cheese Mexican.  Will be making this again. Made in my crock pot adding the cheese for about 5 minutes before serving over buttered noodles.

I made this last night and we really liked it.  Very easy, and even my son (who isn't a big meat fan) liked it.  The only thing I did different was drizzle about a Tablespoon of olive oil on the chichen and then sprinkle w/ the taco seasoning.  Will make again!

My changes: It goes into the crockpot! Add chicken, top with mexican style diced tomatoes instead of salsa (OR rotel + plain diced tomatoes); taco seasoning. High 4 hrs. or low 8 hrs. top w/ sour cream and cheese, on a tortilla! Can add black beans and/or corn as well. YUM!

Super Easy!  I have made this many times with a few variations.  I spread a thin layer of black beans on the bottom of the casserole dish before adding the chicken.  In 40 minutes or so you've got a healthy 1-dish meal full of fiber and protein.  I typically squeeze fresh lime juice on the chicken before sprinkling on the taco seasoning for a tangy kick.  I have used both salsa and canned diced tomatoes to top the chicken and both variations are yummy.  A little cheese is nice- I choose a strong flavor like sharp cheddar.  Optional: add a few crushed corn chips or tortilla strips.

My family loved this recipe!  I put it in the crockpot for 3.5 hours on High and it was absolutely amazing!  I served it over Mexican rice and it is amazing!

Was just ok, all of the ingredients went well but just not enough flavor in the chicken for me. Will try again for sure but will marinate chicken or season more in hopes of more flavor.

This a a recipe I never would have made it it were not for the reviews other people gave!  I was really good though and my husband and son liked it too.  I didn't add the salsa until I had cooked the chicken for about 15  minutes and added some sliced black olives on top of the cheese.  I will be making this again soon..thank you Faye!

LOVED this.... made it exactly as it is on chicken thighs and it was YUMMY... I will make it on chicken breasts next time though.     It makes for a pretty good and indulgent little meal on a night off from super healthy eating!

Tasty, simple, and healthy!  I added some frozen corn and a can of black beans to the salsa, plus a packet of taco seasoning; mixed it all together and poured it on top of the chicken, then let it bake for about 40 min. (I lowered the temperature to 350 so it would be more tender).  Will definitely make again!!

Yum!!  And so easy.  I used half the taco seasoning, didn't want to overwhelm a 3 year old. Served with brown rice and corn.  Tasted good all mixed together.  Just finished eating and realized I forgot the sour cream.  But tasted good without it!!

Excellent recipe. Considering using jalepanos next time and 3/4 packet of taco seasoning. I also like to brown the chicken a bit on a skillet to give it a little bit more flavor.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting too much with this recipe, but, I was pleasantly surprised!   It had a wonderful flavor!  The chicken was moist, juicy, and so flavorful!  As some others did, I dredged the chicken in packet of taco seasoning like you would bread crumbs instead of just sprinkling it on.  It was also great as leftovers the next day!

This recipe was okay but nothing special.  The chicken was tender but too much salsa...it overwhelmed the flavor.  I probably will not be making this again.

Started the chicken over half an hour ago and it is still not thoroughly cooked.  I'm thinking 45 minutes -one hour would be more accurate.

The chicken breasts were still frozen so I cut them up in small pieces, spread some home made salsa in bottom of glass casserole, seasoned the chicken with home made fajita/taco seasoning and placed over salsa, then spread the remaining salsa over the top. I baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes, then served over white rice and sprinkled grated cheese over the top with a dollop of sour cream and Frank's Hot Sauce. Delicious, quick and easy. Everyone liked it. Kyle 4 starts, Denny 4-1/2 and me 4-1/2.

I make this all the time, most times in the crockpot because it's so easy!  I throw the chicken breasts in the crockpot, top with taco seasoning, and then put in the salsa (I really like using Black Bean & Corn salsa), and sometimes I put in a can of cream of chicken soup to make it more creamy.  I have added frozen corn in when using the regular salsa.  I usually serve over white rice.  So good and easy!

Yum! I got home from work and realized that I'd neglected to take the chicken breasts out of the freezer.  I plopped 3 large, frozen chicken breasts in the baking dish, sprinkled a packet of taco seasoning over them and spooned some medium salsa on top, then into the oven at 375 for about an hour. Then I shredded them with a couple of forks and put it back in the over for about 10 minutes to make sure every shred was seasoned, then made soft tacos with shredded lettuce and cheese. So easy, very tasty! Even my meatloaf-and-mashed-potatoes husband liked it.

Great recipe - I'm a new mom of twins, so time is of the essence when I'm trying to prepare a meal.  Definitely use the Ziploc method - it's kind of impossible to sprinkle the seasoning evenly.  I used extra mild taco sauce to ensure that it wouldn't be too spicy.  End result was great (was still a little spicy but my 3 year old still ate it.  Next time I'll use the Taco Seasoning I from this site to tone down the spices (I've made that recipe before and I don't think it has enough spice/heat for ground beef but it would be perfect for this recipe and I see quite a few other reviewers have used it).  I also think that I could live without the cheese (if you are trying to make it lower in fat).  Thanks for the recipe - wish I wouldn't have waited 2 years to try it ;)

This is so good and so easy. I recomend doing 'Broccoli in Roast Chicken Drippings' with the juices from this. Very nice.

I have been making this recipe for years and all the kids and grownups devour it-everytime! I have played around with different variations depending on the amount of time I have to cook dinner and it is always good. I do recommend adding a little salsa to the bottom of the dish rather than greasing it. It's a guaranteed great dinner weather you have time for preparation or not. We usually have tortilla chips or Fritos with ours, helps the kids enjoy it just a little more. Leftovers are great the next day, if there are any!

Of course, I changed it up to suit what we had...but the basics of this recipe is great.  I cubed my chicken and coated with taco seasoning and let sit while I sauted onions, garlic and celery (what I had), added the chicken and 2 cans of black beans.  Cooked the chicken for about 15 minutes. Transferred the chicken mixture to a baking dish, added some peppers, poured on the salsa, covered with foil and baked for 20 minutes. Served over brown rice and topped with a little light sour cream and low fat cheese (we are dieting at my house)  And just for fun I cut some strips of corn tortillas and fried in a small amount of oil and put on top!!!

Really enjoyed this dish!  Tastes like a chicken enchilada without the tortilla.  Agree that shaking the chicken with seasoning in a bag makes it very spicy, but we liked that.  We substituted fat free cheddar cheese to make it slightly healthier.

This was just okay. Really easy but pretty bland. I made mexican rice (recipe on this website) with this and it was a good, fast meal. I would probably make this again if I wanted something easy.

This was very good.  I made this for my husband, who was just put on a low fat diet.  I used low fat sour cream and low fat cheese, you could not tell the difference because when you bake it all the seasoning goes into the chicken and gives it a wonderful flavor.  He asked if we could have this once every two weeks.

This was pretty good.  I will definitely make this again when I need a quick supper.  It really doesn't get any easier than this.  I followed the directions and used shredded colby jack cheese.  I used salsa from our local Mexican eatery and it turned out great.  My kids liked this too.  Thanks for sharing.

I absolutely loved this recipe - I actually first heard about it on the the Food Network in Canada - Chef at Home. I came on here to see if there were alterations to it. This added taco seasoning mix - I just used a tex mex seasoning as well as some staples like garlic powder, salt, pepper and chili-chipotle powder. I cooked at 350 for only 20 minutes and then added the cheese, baked a couple minutes longer and then turned on the broil for a few minutes. I added sour cream which to me completes this dish - must have the sour cream. It was so moist and tasty. A new favourite chicken dish. I served with Mexican Rice II on this site. Thx!

The taco season gives this chicken a nice taste.  I like the fact that I can prepare it quickly after a busy day at work.  My whole family enjoyed it and the leftovers were great too.

This chicken makes EXCELLENT tacos! I put the chicken in the crockpot with a can of diced tomatoes and 3/4 jar of Newman's Own Salsa. Coated the chicken with the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site (GREAT recipe!) and cooked on low for 5.5-6 hours. Shredded with forks and popped into toasted corn tortillas with avocado, lettuce, sour cream, feta cheese and a squeeze of lime juice. I will NEVER make ground turkey tacos again like I used to do! This is how we'll do tacos from now on - restaurant quality! Thanks!

Very yummy! We ate this dish with brown rice.
 The next night I threw a can of black beans with the leftover rice and chicken and made them into a burrito.

I think that part of the point of the recipe is to be able to make something quickly.  I made the recipe exactly as is, and added nothing extra.  I simply omitted the cheese to cut out some fat.  I don't think it's necessary to use a bag, marinate, etc. as others mentioned.  I recommend preparing this AS IS...it's very moist and simply wonderful!  I baked it for exactly 25 min.

Great recipe. I just marinated the chicken w/ the taco seasoning & water (like others have done) instead of sprinkling it on the chicken so it wouldn't be quite as spicy. Everything else I did as the recipe said and it came out awesome. My new fav. chicken dish! Good job!  I'll def. be making this again sometime. Quick and easy too.

I've found a great new way to cook chicken that not only is delicious but also fast and easy.  Before I left for work on Tuesday I put the chicken brests in a Ziploc bag with the juice from a can of Rotel and the taco seasoning. Put this in the fridge and left it to marinate.  Got home and just completed the dish.  I mixed the rotel contents that were left in the can with the salsa.  It  had a lot of flavor and my biggest surprise was how much my kids who are picky eaters enjoyed it and complemented me.  Thank you Faye.

Super easy and really good too! I used old el paso hot sauce in the little packets, I was out of salsa and had a whole ziploc bag full of those, so I put some of them to great use. This turned out very good and I will sure make it again. Thanks, this is a fantastic recipe!!

OMG THIS WAS SOOOOOO GOOD. MY BF TOLD ME I WAS REALLY PUSHING HIS TASTE BUDS WITH THIS ONE, BUT HE LOVES IT (HE'S A VERY PICKY EATER)!! I DIDN'T HAVE CHICKEN BREAST, ONLY TENDERS, SO I COOKED UP THE TENDERS, CHOPPED THEM UP AND MIXED WITH MILD PICANTE SAUSE, ADDED SOME CHOPPED RED BELL PEPPERS, AND ROLLED THEM UP IN TORTILLA'S LIKE AN ENCHILADA, BAKED ON 350 FOR ABOUT 20 MINS.

This is a decent recipe. I put the chicken and seasoning in a ziploc bag to get a better coating as mentioned in other reviews. The kids didn't care for it. I probably won't make this again, but I'm glad I tried it.

This was really good.  I used a taco seasoning recipe off this site and served it with hot, home made tortillas and black beans and rice (off this site too).  Thanks.

This recipe is awesome! I changed it up a little (okay...maybe a lot), but my inspiration came from the original recipe. First, I used 6 boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead of 4. I coated the chicken with 2 standard-sized packets of taco seasoning (I used "mild", and it had just the right amount of heat for our family), and I threw the chicken in the crock pot, along with about 2 cups of "medium" salsa. I sprinkled about a teaspoon of Goya brand Adobo over everything, and let it go for about 3 1/2 hours on high. Then, I shredded the chicken up using 2 forks, added 2 packets of Goya brand Sazon and 2 regular sized cans of chicken broth, and stirred it all together. I let it cook on high for 30 minutes more, then we had the mixture over white rice with canned sweet corn. It was LOVED by all of us! Thanks so much for sharing!

Very easy on the cook, and gobbled up by my husband and daughter. Served with Mexican Bean Salad, from this site, and baked whole wheat tortilla chips. Bake in a dish that just fits the chicken and salsa, because the salsa burns if it is spread out in a larger dish. Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh so quick and easy! My 12 year old nephew loved it, I enjoyed it. Basic. I used fajita seasonings vs taco seasoning. Also- for me the sour cream was a must. I used medium salsa, and once it was cooked on the chicken, it was more on the mild side. I think the baking mellows it out. Give it a try, it's worth that!

Amazing!!  I was a little hesitant at first but was impressed with the results.  I didn't use any measurements however which made the quick dish even quicker.  I put the chicken in the dish, sprinkled with seasoning and turned to repeat, spooned salsa on to cover and put a silce of cheddar cheese on near the end of cookoing time.  Once cooked I removed the chicken and added some cooked white rice the the leftover watery salsa mess in the dish to absorb the flavour and then served that along with corn.  Finding a side dished that suited this dish was difficult for me but the rice works really well!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe was GREAT! I love salsa and I seriously think I could eat this chicken everyday! I served it with yellow rice and a side salad. 

It also is a simple recipe method that can be used with other flavors. I used the same recipe to make italian chicken, only instead of taco mix I used italian seasoning, garlic powder, and pepper. Topped it with a can of diced italian style tomatoes and then at the last 5 minutes sprinkled mozarella cheese until bubbly. Great simple recipe that is wonderful either with salsa or made italian style! THANKS SO MUCH!

I took the advice of the person a few posts down and shook the chicken and seasoning up thoroughly in a plastic bag, then coated the bottom with salsa. What flavor! Anything my S.O. asks for seconds on is a hit! I wasn't so enthusiastic about this recipe, but it was very tasty and SO easy to make. I don't think I've cooked a dinner with only ONE pot to clean in years!

Instead of partially using a taco seasoning packet I made the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site.  Used a Mexican blend of cheese and used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  It reminded me of the inside of a taco so that's what we made for lunch the next day with the leftovers: the chicken, left over "Mexican Rice II", leftover "Guacamole" (both recipes from this site), more cheese, salsa and sour cream.  It made one of the best homemade tacos I've ever had!

WOW and double WOW!!  It could not be easier or taste better.  I did just what the recipe said and served with light sour cream and avocado slices!  EVERYONE LOVED IT.  I have made it again two days later to have for my lunches!  I have added extra salsa and put 1 1/2 cup of uncooked white rice underneath with enough chicken broth to equal the amount of water used to cook rice.  We love it both ways.

This was good, however I may not use the whole amount of taco seasoning next time I make it.  I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe.  The salsa I used was chunky, I might puree it a little or I might use a salsa that isn't as chunky.

This is a great weeknight dish. It is so quick and easy to prepare. I used chicken tenderloins, so I didn't bake it quite as long. The leftovers made a nice lunch the next day. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this chicken recipe! I did marinade it overnight with a good Tbs of the taco seasoning and some water because I was concerned that it would be to spicy. Although I do like spice- the kids do not. Afer baking it for 30 minutes it was perfect! Definite change from the same boring chicken!

After all of the great reviews, I guess I was expecting something fabulous. This was just mediocre for us, even for a weeknight dinner. Hubby didn't like it much and asked me not to make it again. Oh well. Thanks anyway!

This dish was so good!!!!  I ended up using Lawry's chicken taco seasoning on the chicken.  And I put a little more salsa on top of the chicken for some extra flavor.  Served with some Mexican rice, it was a huge hit!  Definitely making this again!

This is a delicious and simple recipe.  We added some extra cumin and cooked on a bed of yellow corn.  We also added crushed tortilla chips to the top after it was done baking.  I gave it 4 stars because without these changes, this wouldn't have been quite as good.

My family loves this recipe. I put a little salsa in the bottom of my pan, rub the chicken with taco seasoning mix and then place it on top of the salsa. I then add salsa over the top and sprinkle sharp cheddar cheese for the finishing touch. I do not use the sour cream even though I am a big fan of it. I don't feel that the chicken needs it. I serve this with the "Best Spanish Rice" recipe from this site.

It was okay. The plus side is that it's super easy. I would suggest trying the Monterey Chicken with Potatoes recipe on this site instead for a tastier and more complete meal. Almost as easy as the salsa chicken but much, much better!

This is a great recipe!! I marinated about six chicken breasts to one package taco mix with a little water for about 45 minutes. I baked them with the mixture and made enough thin sauce to flavor the rice!! I forgot  the sour cream and didn't even notice til later.

This recipe was a super easy and very tasty Mexican meal. It goes well with Mexican style rice and refried or black beans. I have also made it with a sort of "topping" of crumbled up tortilla chips which is really good too.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet !  We make this probably once a month -- very easy and flavorful !!  The only change we do is to add some sliced black olives when we add the cheddar cheese towards the end.  Thank you for a great, easy recipe !!

This was surprisingly fantastic. I say surprisingly because it was so easy, I assumed it would taste like nothing special. I was wrong. It tasted like I'd spent a ton of time preparing, etc.  The presentation was beautiful with the sour cream dollop on top. It definitely NEEDS the sour cream on it to make the dish. The chicken was remarkably juicy. I used one whole packet (i.e., more than the recipe required) of taco seasoning to cover the top & bottom of each breast.  I served with a box of chicken flavored rice/vermecelli, which was actually a terrific balance to all the Mexican flavors. A Spanish rice on the side would have been way too much of the same flavor, so I do recommend choosing a non-Mexican/Spanish side accompaniment.  Great fast recipe that will look like you worked a lot harder than you did!!!

Excellent! I received this as my daily recipe yesterday; had all ingredients on hand so I made it this evening. Really a quick, easy meal! My husband has been talking about it since the first bite; it's 2 hours later... This was very good. The sour cream is a total must in this recipe!

One word for this recipe.......Excellent! FYI for anyone wondering what kind of salsa to use, I used Chi-Chi's mild (just because it's one of my favorites).

I wasn't sure if we'd like this but it seemed simple enough for a quick meal tonight without much fuss.  After having a baby 2 weeks ago I needed something FAST.  This was great.  I did use chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and I took a taco seasoning packet and put it in a sandwich baggie and "coated" the chicken that way, instead.  I put a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan while cooking, too.  The "coated" chicken had a BITE to it.  EXTREMELY SPICY.....so sour cream would've been a great addition, but we didn't have any.  If you like SPICY foods...try it this way.  I served it with white rice on the side.  YUMM!  I will make this again.  Thanks!

OMG - YUMMY! 
I changed the recipe a bit 'cause I'm on LA Weight Loss.
First I cut open the chicken breasts and used my own salt free taco seasoning and sprinkled very generously on all sides. The I used 1 TBSP peach pineapple salsa on the inside and 1/2oz of shredded skim dbl cheddar cheese folded the chicken breast half over put another 1 TBSP peach pineapple salsa on the top of the chicken breast. Baked in a preheated oven at 400 degrees for 22 min's putting another 1/2oz of cheese on top for the last 2 min's.  Topped it off w/ 1 TBSP low fat sourcream and dig in, very juicy, moist and flavourful. I will definately make this again.

Great recipe and fast to make. I used a Southwestern Black bean and white corn salsa that I had in the cabinet. I can't imagine regular salsa making it any better, lol.

I love this recipe! I really like spicy, so I don't leave out the toppings like jalepenos, spicy salsa, etc. I do use the Ortega spicy hot taco seasoning. Very good. Only problem for me though is that the chicken breast isn't flavorful inside and it throws off the contrast of the spiciness on the outside. I personally would like to be able to have the whole thing spicy (inside & out) or even just flavorful! Any suggestions for this, please feel free to submit. My family & friends like this recipe, but I think they prefer it to not be so spicy! This recipe is fantastic. Thanks so much!

This recipe was excellent!  I made it last night for dinner for my parents, my husband and myself since I have picky 2 and 4 year olds but to my surprise my 4 year old even ate it!  My husband asked me to put this in my cooking rotation.  The compliments don't get any better than that!  I took the advice of some others as our family loves spicy and used a whole packet of taco seasoning (on 8 pieces of chicken) and it was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the easiest recipe & the tastiest! My husand and I loved it. I used a whole packet of taco seasoning mix & medium salsa. I served it with tortillas and refried beans. It was even better the next day, I warmed the chicken up added the beans & made it into a burrito, very yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

This was ok.  The chicken was overdone after 25 minutes, and I think it needed more salsa or something.  I probably won't make it again, or if I do, I will change things a lot.

Not too bad for a no-brainer. Made a few times, first time pretty much to the recipe, second time I made my own salsa and it was even better, third time I used thighs and drumsticks and added a can of black beans to the salsa, great every time.

I actually use a combination of cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt to season the chicken breasts before covering them in salsa and baking.  This gives it a little more of a kick than usual.  Chunky salsa I recommend to give the sauce more substance.  I've also been known to throw in some sliced mushrooms or zucchini halfway through to provide vegetables with the dish.

Really simple and really good.  I used 1 and 1/2 jars salsa because I served w/rice so I used the salsa as a sauce.  Definitely shake the chicken in a bag w/seasoning - much easier.  Cooked up tender.  Served w/rice and corn that, now that I think about it, if you just added about 1 cup raw rice and corn to bottom of dish (along w/1 cup water or so) it would have made a nice 1 dish casserole.

I have made this several times and my family loves it!The last time I made it I decided to chop the chicken and add corn and black beans, I then spread refried beans on top and added the cheese the last 10 minutes of cooking. I served it with sourcream,salsa and shredded lettuce on the side. I also had soft shells and tortilla chips so they could eat it like dip or a soft taco.Everyone tried it both ways and loved it!

I expected a lot from this recipe, after seeing how it had been reviewed. I was not very impressed at all. The seasoning was a bit much, I didn't like the way it was too spicy and overpowering. I will not make this again.

I really like this recipe, it is so easy too! We usually cook the chicken, then cut it into strips for burritos. But, if you are planning on doing that, I would suggest cutting the chicken up before you cook it, then putting a sprinkle of taco/burrito seasoning on each strip, and covering with salsa. It ensures that every bite of chicken is full of flavor!

A success!  I served this with a box of Spanish rice that you add your own tomatoes too and it was fantastic.  So easy.  I highly suggest!

We really enjoyed this.  Gourmet its not, but simple hearty fare. It's also a snap to make. Instead of taco seasoning which I find very salty, I sprinkled on chilli powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper.  I served it with brown rice.  We'll definately have it again!

I really enjoy this recipe. For something so simple, quick, and easy it's really tasty! We like to have it with the Margarita on the rocks recipe from this site as well.

This was a big hit at my house!  I used 6 chicken legs with thighs, cut them up, rubbed the taco seasoning on them, and poured a whole jar of salsa over top of them and stuck them in the fridge to marinate overnight.  I covered dishes and at 35minutes, they were perfect!  Juicy, moist, and oh-so-flavourful!  I served this on top of The Best Spanish Rice from this site and with grated medium cheddar and sour cream overtop. Thanks!

Oh, this turned out so good.  Here's what we did: cut the chicken in large strips and coated with the taco seasoning.  Then mixed 1C Minute Rice with 1C water, the salsa, about 1C of corn, a chopped jalapeno, and a dash of cayenne.  Poured the rice mixture into the pan, then topped with the spiced chicken.  Baked for 35 minutes, then topped with 1C crushed tortilla chips and a mixture of Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese, and baked for 5 minutes.  It was SO good.  Served with sour cream on top.

This recipe is FANTABULOUS and easy to make.  The only change I made was to squeeze fresh lemon on each side of the chicken after I added the taco seasoning mix.  This gave it a great flavor.

BIG hit! The cheese is great for presentation, but doesn't really add too much flavor... if you want low fat, leave it out, and it doesn't really make that big of a difference.

This was incredibly easy and yummy. I used jack cheese instead of cheddar and served it with a dollop of sour cream, spanish rice, refried beans and a simple salad. My husband said it was the best dinner he's had in a long time, as good as going out for Mexican! Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

This is a wonderfully delicious and easy recipe.  I got this recipe from another source and have been making it for a couple of years.  If I don't have chicken breasts, I sometimes use boneless pork chops and it works almost as well.

Pounded the chicken breasts thinner and rubbed the taco seasoning mix into the breasts. This reminded me of something you would find on a buffet line -- Easy to prepare but it tastes like it was easy to prepare. Not horrible but not that great either. I do think that the type of salsa used makes a big difference and I will make this again but change the type of salsa. Sour cream is a must. Served with a black bean and rice dish from this site.

Holy Cow!!! Faye...this was fantastic.  We doubled the recipe and chopped up the chicken into bite-size peices. I had to drain off quite a bit of liquid before I added the cheese. I also used pepper jack cheese slices along with the cheddar and it was a hit.  I'll definitley be making this again.

Simply put, it was AWESOME! Never has something been so easy and tasted so good! My boyfriend ate it all up and raved about it. I'll be sure to make this again! I also used the Mexican Rice II recipe as a side dish, and both complimented each other very well.

The EASIEST recipe ever.  And TASTY!  I've given this out to all of my who are low-carbing and they love it.  I chose Pace which was lower in carbs than others.

A very good chicken recipe.   Easy and very tasty.    Be sure to watch your cooking time.   The chicken pieces I used were medium size - I cooked them for 30 mins and after adding an additional 5 mins on to melt the cheese - the chicken was a little dry.   I'll cut down the cooking time by about 5 mins next time.

WOW!  It doesn't get much easier than this!  I used the recipe with chili powder rather than taco seasoning just because it was handy; if you pour on some extra salsa and cheese it's delicious with chips or over Mexican rice.  Yum!

Excellent recipe. Very fast & easy to make. I used a spicy taco seasoning, medium salsa, & a shredded tex-mex blend of cheese. I put the entire package of seasoning in a baggie, & coated the chicken that way. I also used about two cups of salsa. This is a keeper!

We did not care for this but I can't blame the recipe.  I couldn't find the usual salsa that we like so I tried a new brand and I feel that it was the salsa that ruined it for us.  Make sure that you use Salsa that you know and love already.

This was FAB!!!! So quick and easy and so few ingredients. I used the low sodium taco seasoning (whole packet), boneless, skinless chicken thighs, shook in a baggie and then covered with cut up onions and peppers and then a whole jar of hot salsa. Covered with shredded cheddar and monterey jack cheeses. Served over white rice. Three things that told me this was a keeper -
1. My husband exlaimed, THIS one's a keeper.
2. HE put away the leftovers.
3. He laughed when he realized that the hot salsa was a little to hot for me and he could have the rest.
Next time - medium salsa. Because this was sooo good I want to eat it too.
Thanks! Faye

Very Easy, Very Quick, Very Good! I used the taco seasoning sparingly, because my family doesn't like spicy things. And all six of my family members loved it! I served mashed potatoes and corn as sides. Wonderful dish.

A good, easy recipe for chicken.  Next time I would put more salsa on top (makes a good sauce for rice).  My husband also thought it could use a little more taco seasoning.  I'll probably make this more often when we have kids since I'll have much less time to cook!  This is a good one for when we don't have much time to prepare something.

Gotta love these easy, tasty recipes that use only a few ingredients. I used a little more cheese than called for, and mixed monterey jack with the cheddar. Other cheese combinations could include mozzarella. I also used Fred Imus (mild)salsa, which I think is the best. Even my teenage daughter said this was good and she says she doesn't generally like chicken.

I modified the recipe and it came out great.  I marinated the chicken breasts overnight in a mixture of lime juice, olive oil, and some spices.  Then I pan fried it in olive oil cooking with shallots, just for a few minutes.  Then I put it in a casserole dish with 1.5 cups of salsa combined with the kernels I cut off 2 corn ears (very pretty).  I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes or so, then I put mozzerella cheese on top and baked it 5 more minutes.  At the end I put a dollop of sour cream on each breast and it came out great!  I served it with tomato basil rice from Uncle Ben's that I livened up with some spices.   Reasonably healthy and very presentable!

This recipe was so easy and so good.  I normally do not like Medium Salsa, however in this recipe it gave it much flavor and a little kick.  Will definitely make it again!

I made it last night & it was wonderful!  I used 3 tsp of a hot seasoning mix then I used a sweeter, medium heat salsa.  I threw in some sweet corn kernels too.  I only used a 1/2 cup of cheese & fat-free sour cream to lower the already low calorie & fat content.  It was extremely easy & ready in exactly 30 minutes.  I paired it up with Spanish rice, fresh broccoli & corn bread.  I will make this again for sure!

Great find! I didn't have taco seasoning, so I mixed up powered onion, garlic, chili powder and rolled it in that. I also lightly sauted the chicken to brown on both sides, then dumped a carton of "Jack's special salsa" in it, put a lid on it, and left. Boys added cheese on their own.
Great new addition to the lineu up!!

I fixed this for my partner and I, and we both enjoyed it. She's not a fan of the taco seasoning so next time I'll reduce the amount on a couple breasts.  Also, we substituted ranch dressing for the sour cream and found it equally appealing.
This is great, and will be a regular item in our rotation.

FABULOUS, EASY RECIPE!  This dish was a HUGE hit with my daughter, husband and myself.  We just love chicken and this is a great way to try something different.  Try having this with a huge plate of freshly steamed veggies...WONDERFUL!  I am definitely keeping this recipe around for awhile and making this dish quite often!  Very juicy, tender and flavorful chicken.

I'll admit I was skeptical about this recipe even with the 200+ five star ratings and the raving reviews.  Let me add my own- this was delicious!  The chicken was moist unlike most baked chicken recipes.  This one's a keeper!

Talk about delicious, and easy too.  Great when your looking for a quick meal for a large gang.  I use my homemade salsa when I have it on hand, but it's still good when made with the store bought salsa too.

Thank you, Thank you!  I was just about ready to give up cooking with blah chicken breasts, but this recipe revived my taste buds!  I used homemade salsa (of course the recipe is from this site Fresh Salsa II - love that stuff) and it helped make this dish amazing.

Tasty! I skipped the sour cream and used about 2 oz. of cheddar, enough to lightly cover the chicken, to stay lower in fat.  Even one of my kids liked it, and it was easy to make!

Very easy indeed. From start to finish, I prepared an entire meal in 45 minutes. I chose to serve it with pasta, bread, and a salad, and kept guests at bay with chips and salsa beforehand.

This was really good.  I had a little nacho cheese sauce hanging around and put that on top instead of the cheddar and it really gave it a good flavor.  I also followed previous advice and shook it in a plastic bag - that coated wonderfully!

Pretty good.  Kids weren't crazy about it.  I failed to use a 'mild' taco seasoning so it was a bit spicy.

This was awesome.  I stretched the sauce a bit by adding 1 cup of plain tomato sauce to 1 cup salsa then served it over white rice with a side of brocolli.  My 4 year old asked when I was going to make it again!

Wow!  I find myself making this about once a week.  The leftovers are great, and it's so quick!  Taco seasoning to taste--I find myself using a little more than the recipe calls for.

Very tasty - quick and easy.  Tossing the chicken and seasoning in a ziploc bag is a good suggestion.

DELICIOUS!  DELICIOUS!  DELICIOUS!  I loved this--can you tell?  I used some kind of pineapple peach? salsa (Safeway Select Brand), Pepper Jack Cheese, Cheddar Cheese and sour cream.  It was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe for weeknights when you want something quick, easy, and yummy.  I suggest using the Pace Chipotle salsa and Mexican 3 cheese blend for a more complex flavor.  I also added sliced black olives with the cheese.

My kids just love this dish. the chicken comes out so moist.  Not only is this dish kid friendly  but also great for dinner parties.  Your guest would never know you spent so little time on the dish. YOu can serve it for adults as well as kids depending on your side dishes you use.  It is great my kids think I am the best cook, little do they know that this recipe is one of the easiest out there.

This was a nice change from "the same old chicken".  Not a recipe I would make for company, but an easy, quick dish to throw together when you're pressed for time.  I made it as printed, but used more salsa and cheese.

This is the greatest!  The first time I made it I accidently cut the chicken into chunks.  I made it into chicken burritos with refried beans, Spanish rice, shredded cheese, black olives, and sour cream.  My family absolutely loved it!

It was great. I added more cheddar cheese then the recipe called for. Yes, I think it needs more of that taco sesoning ( but that's me personally, cause my family thought it had just enough), I'm not even sure how much I put on the chicken, but I think it was more then couple of tablespoons, but everybody's different. I saw a review about Pace medium salsa and me personaly or my family didn't think it was too spicy ( and they don't like spicy foods). But we're cheese lovers, so I put extra cheddar cheese, but I think that extra sharp be even better. Great recipe. Thanks a lot. This one is a keeper.

I am amazed that anything this easy can be so good!  This is a wonderful recipe!  We like it so much that we adapted it for campout use ~ We make foil pouches, add 1/4 cup of rice, half a cup of water, then the chicken, seasoning, salsa, and cheese.  Seal up the pouches, and cook over the coals or fire.  It takes about 20 minutes to cook.  Awesome campout food, especially for tired hikers!  This is what my husband brought when it was his turn to provide meals for the adults at a Boy Scout campout, and it was a huge hit!  They tried to vote him in as perminent Grub Master (he objected).

This dish is easy & good.  You can adjust the 'heat' of the dish through the salsa (mild, medium or hot) and the amount of taco seasoning.  Very flavorful, simple and good.  I used plain rice but I can see how it would be great with spanish rice too.

I made this with leftover rotisserie chicken. I didn't have taco seasoning on hand. (I googled diy taco seasoning) and used 1 jar salsa. I did not use a crockpot, I made this on the stove and cooked it till everything was heated thru. for a quick throw together meal I was surprised how good it was.

I used this recipe as a quick and easy way to make chicken for tacos. Followed the recipe exactly except I never added the shredded cheese or sour cream. After it cooled for a few minutes, I shredded the chicken using two forks. Put this chicken in some tacos topped with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, the works. Perfect and quick and easy! Will definitely use this recipe for chicken tacos going forth.

Simple and flavorful.  Instead of baking in the oven, I did in a foil covered pan on my grill.  When it's 90 plus degrees in FL it's cheaper not to add oven heat to AC bills to keep the house cool.  Will definitely make again!

This is almost a repeat of the cilantro lime chicken recipe, which is my routine go-to, only difference is adding chopped cilantro and the juice of one lime. Thanks for the suggestion of putting the chicken in a ziploc with the seasoning mix first - I'll have to try that next time!

Yummy!
I let the taco seasoning marinate overnight. I also put the chicken on the grill, 2 mins on both sides. I then placed the grilled chicken in a pan, added the chunky salsa, let it cook for 10 mins, added cheddar cheese, and cooked it for 5 more mins. I served it with spanish rice and tortillas on the side. Simple and delicious!

Tasty with a nice bite to it.  Great time saver for weekday nights. You can control the  degree of  "hot" by going form mild to hot salsa.

Nice quick meal. I used hot and spicey taco seasoning and medium heat salsa. Dish had a nice kick. I think next time I will try regular taco seasoning  with a hot salsa just to compare. Forgot the sour cream but it was fine without the sour cream.

I? have made this now many times and it is great! Now one of my staple dishes as it is easy and delicious. Usually just serve over rice with corn. Also sometimes I? use Mexican cheese or pepper jack to change it up and always good.

This was the bomb as far as my family was concerned.  I have 1 that will eat anything and 4 that r so picky it's horrible!!  Like many others I used what I had.  We freeze meat when it's on sale.  I had mine with lemon pepper.  I put it n sheet cake pan, and per reviews added salsa in bottom of pan.  Sprinkled taco seasoning on top then rest of salsa on them.  Drizzled oil over them, baked @ 375 for 25 minutes.  Took out & covered with foil for 10 minuets.  Removed foil & sprinkled with cheese (lots) & put back in oven till it melted.  Wasn't good, was GREAT!!!  NO LEFTOVERS.  Son-n-law took pictures & showed @ work.  Every one wants recipes & thinks there's nothing I can't cook.  Again what was n kitchen was used.  Umm, left over cheese dip would have worked too & I forgot I had any.

Talk about winner, winner, chicken dinner. My family LOVED this along with Spanish Rice, Mexican Corn, and warm Corn Bread. This was all of my favorite things. Tasty, cheap, and quick perfect for a working mom.

I can't beleive I've never made this before.  The reason is probably that I fancy myself somewhat as a Home chef and this is just too easy. There's no chopping or prepping?! Clearly it can't be good enough for MY standards...WRONG! I finally tried it as I am desperate (as a new mom who also works full time) to find quick and easy family friendly but lean chicken dinners for our crazy week nights. This was a hit with everyone including my 1 yr old. I served it with yellow rice, black beans, and steamed spinach. I was pleasantly surprised with how flavorful it was, but the tenderness of the chicken was the best surprise of all. After reading reviews, I tossed the chicken breasts in a ziploc to coat it in the taco seasoning (I used ol el paso original). I placed a tiny bit of salsa on the bottom of the casserole dish, topped with chicken, then 1 cup of salsa ( I used medium tostitos), and baked for 35 min before topping with cheese and baking a few more minutes until melty. I topped the chicken with a dollup of sour cream and a slice of avocado. This is going on our regular rotation for its simplicity and deliciousness! :)

I make this chicken fairly regularly now as it's simple to put together and throw in the oven.  I recommend making your own taco seasoning to spice it up as much as you like.  I always serve it over white rice with some sliced avocado as well.

Peach salsa! That totally made this dish a hit! Will be making this again and again. Made exactly as recipe stated with my salsa choice being Newman's Own Peach Salsa. Fast and simple, perfect to make for the family after a busy work day. I may chop some fresh cilantro next time and sprinkle over cheese before putting it back into the oven for those last 5 mins.

This was so so easy and delicious.  Both my husband (who is not a salsa fan) and my daughter (who loves everything Mexican) loved it and said the recipe was a keeper.  I used Mrs Dash salt-free taco seasoning.  Leftovers for lunch the next day were just as good!

Easy and delicious.  I made my own taco seasoning (salt-free) and served with black beans, sliced green onions and jalapenos.  The leftovers warmed up nicely and were maybe even better the 2nd time around.  I have already past out the recipe to several friend and family members.

I thought it was very good. I shook mine in a bag with the full packet of seasoning like others did. I would recommend this. Seems like it would be bland if you only sprinkled it. I also added the fresh jalapeños on top as I read another person did. But mine is definitely spicy. I'd make it again because it's so easy

Kind of funny, I made this last week for the first time. Looked for a recipe that was simple and had a lot of positive reviews. After browsing the reviews I did the suggestions of others to pound the breast down to 1/2 inch thick and use Mexican style shredded cheese. Everyone really liked it. I told my coworker (who doesn't cook much) about the recipe and he made it for his wife. They like it as well.

Was looking for something new to do with chicken breasts that was relatively healthy and ingredients I already had on hand. This is super easy and all enjoyed it. The taco seasoning is strong and I worried it'd be too spicy for kids, but they liked it. I used Colby/Monterey Jack cheese on top because that is what I had on hand.  I served it with rice and black beans. Will definitely make again.

This is remarkably good given the humble few ingredients. I used more taco seasoning than called for - just easier to dump it on. I also did the following and my hubby really, really like it:
In a 9x13: spread a little salsa, add a layer of crushed tortilla chips, a can of refried beans and a little more salsa. Add the chicken per recipe. Viola! Instant Mexican casserole!

For those saying it doesnt have flavor and is bland... they are CRAZY. This dish has SO much flavor. Use Sour Cream & Guacamole to make even more delicious. For a delightful crunchy texture, add crumbled tortilla chips at the same time you add the cheese and it is amazing

We really liked the dish...with some tweaks. Since several reviews mentioned serving with rice and beans, I decided to make it like my chicken and rice recipe. In the bottom of the 9x13 pan, I put salsa, 1/2 cup rice, 1 cup chicken broth and 1 can of drained and rinsed black beans. I put the chicken on top, covered with foil and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes. Our only complaint was that it seemed to spicy so I will reduce the amount of taco seasoning.  I served it with sour cream and finely chopped lettuce.  Very good and easy!! Thanks for sharing!

Yum! This is a great chicken dish and so easy to prepare. It reminded me of enchiladas and made great left-overs.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It smelled wonderful.  It looked wonderful.  I was disappointed in the taste.  But I'm not giving up.  It may have been the cheap salsa I bought.  Will try again with a better salsa and see how that goes.

Big hit with the whole family!  I put the taco seasoning in a bag and coated the chicken shake and bake style. Chicken was moist and delicious. Really good with a tex mex cheese blend  on top and some spanish rice on the side. Husband said this is a keeper!!

I'm eating the leftovers right now and my mouth is having a major party. THIS IS DELICIOUS. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (6ct) because of the added flavor. Other than that, I only made slight changes based upon my read of many reviews. I put a thin layer of Pace chunky salsa down on bottom of glass baking dish, then I did the taco seasoning on both sides of all chicken and placed it on top of that. I used a can of original Rotel over the top of the chicken (drained), and cooked as recommended to 35 mins. Removed, added copious amounts of cheddar cheese and returned to over for 5 mins longer. When I took it out, I put on top black olives and cilantro, and a few scallions. I served with sour cream and the best spanish rice from this site. Guys, this is superb. Reheated 2 days later, still awesome.

I've been making this recipe for years.  It is great just the way it is written.  We like to sprinkle the chicken with chopped cilantro after it comes out of the oven and add a dollop of low fat sour cream.  To make it even more low cal, use low fat shredded Mexican blend or low fat shredded cheese.  Quick, easy and delicious!

I make a crock pot version of this. I add a can of chicken stock to cook chicken in, in  the crock pot for about 4 hours. Then, i shred the chicken breat up once cooked and let it all bubble away on low for another hour to let the flavors combine. Makes for an amazimg chicken burrito and is really juicy.

I made this the other night with a slight change to recipe, made my own taco seasoning (found here on allrecipes).   The recipe for the taco seasoning had called for a pinch of pepper flakes and a pinch of cayenne but I put in a 1/4 tsp of each.  My husband loved this so I guess this recipe will be in my rotation.

Super easy and delicious! It was perfectly cooked, and there wasn't much to it! You pretty much just lay the chicken out in the baking pan and then pour salsa over it...super simple! The only change I made was that I used Goya's Adobo seasoning instead of taco seasoning (b/c that was what I had). I used a salsa from BJ's, it's a Medium Organic salsa and it is super flavorful. It was SO good! My husband said, "This chicken is fire!" :)

This was amazing! My roommates love it and has become a fast and easy meal for all of us. I find squeezing some fresh limes over the chicken before putting it into the oven gives some good zing! I used 1 lime for every 3 pieces of chicken I had and it was great!

I made this recipe following a few other reviews and just put half a pack of taco seasoning in the bag with the chicken and shook it together. I poured a little salsa on the bottom of the pan, placed the chicken on top of it and then poured the remaining salsa over that. I baked the dish for 25 min and then added Mexican shredded cheese and baked another 3. I topped mine with sour cream and jalapeños but for my boys I only used sour cream. I made Spanish rice as the side. I loved the chicken it reminded me of an enchilada without the tortilla. My 6 year old thought is was great as well but my 2 year old said it was spicy. Next time I'll make his following the instructions and only sprinkle it with a little on both sides. This recipe is definitely a keeper and super simple for the inexperienced cook like myself.

Made this recipe for my family of 10 and some guests, everyone loved it! Prep time was longer then 5 minutes, only because of the amount I made. Anyways, it was a huge success! People came back asking for more! Definitely a great meal (:

Salsa Chicken Haiku: "Gotta say I'm shocked, not only was this easy, it tasted great too!" I made this for lunch just for myself w/ one medium sized chicken breast, and used one of those small cans of Herdez salsa and sprinkled cheese on, not really measuring it. Other than craving cilantro when I went to eat it (w/ lettuce and chopped tomatoes), I was really happy w/ the results. Easy ingredients and foolproof directions. I will gladly make this again for the entire family and probably serve w/ some black beans, rice, or tortillas on the side.

I love this recipe! It's so easy which is great for a beginner cook like me. I did some things a little bit differently-- I used mango salsa which tasted AMAZING. And I squeezed a bunch of lime over everything and served it with sour cream, avocado slices, and a rice, bean, and corn mix! SO GOOD. Definitely making this again.

I made it just like the recipe and it was great. I used Pace Chunky Salsa b/c it's less watery and it worked out perfectly.

Excellent!!! Made just as directed. The chicken was super moist and had great flavor. My husband and I both loved it. Next time (and there will be a next time!), due to low sodium diet I will use the taco season from this site and my own salsa. Tip: Line your pan with foil for super easy cleanup.

I love this recipe! I made it just like it says! When it's done I laid it on a bed of lettuce, drizzle black beans on it, lime slices to squeeze on it, low fat sour cream on top and avocado. I made southwestern corn served on the same plate. It was so good and easy!

I've made this twice so far and we really like it.  I'm not giving it 5 stars primarily because I've not followed the recipe precisely. We really don't care for boneless, skinless breasts so I've made it with chicken thighs, both boneless, skinless and regular. As I wasn't using the amount of chicken the recipe called for, I didn't worry about measuring the rest of the ingredients. I used a taco seasoning recipe I found here and simply coated both sides of the chicken with it. Then I poured a nice quantity of salsa over the chicken so it was well coated. (We always use a medium, thick & chunky salsa and it worked great.)  Using more chicken and thicker pieces of it, I baked it for 45 minutes initially. The first time I made it we had no cheddar cheese so I finished off a package of shredded mozzarella & provolone to top to top it with. The second time we had a quality, really aged NY cheddar that I used. Both cheeses were delicious. My husband's first reaction to eating this was, "You can make this any time you want!"

I had no idea if I'd like this but It's now a regular addition to my menu.  I've since made some changes.  I did what another person did and put the seasoning in a bag and dropped the breasts in.  Then as she did, I put salsa on the bottom of the baking dish.  I also copied her idea of using a thick slice of Mexican melting cheese on top about ten minutes from the end.  I then put grated cheddar on five minutes later.  That makes it a ten star recipe. This is so simple!

Love, love, love this!  Such an easy weeknight meal!  We make it with the quinoa and black beans recipe also on this site.  Also, we follow the tips in the first review - use rotel instead of salsa, cook at 400 for 30-35 minutes, top with cheese then put back in oven for a few minutes then let it rest.  Also like to add a can of green chilis when we make it with 3-4 breasts.  So, so easy!!

My husband is not easily given to complimenting my cooking. He loved this and said he wouldn't mind eating it every night. I served it over canned sweet corn mixed with a quinoa wild rice mixture. It was tasty, and moist even the second night after reheating in the microwave.

Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make. Complemented side dish "Better Spanish Rice" and a couple of cans of Mexican corn very nicely.

Not bad! I made it as written, and the chicken was moist. I might consider brining my chicken next time since not much of the taco flavoring actually soaked into the meat during baking. My chicken breasts were large though; perhaps thinner chicken breast would have absorbed more of the flavor. Will definitely try this one again though!

Simple, easy and delicious! I used a 15 oz jar of mild chunky salsa and homemade taco seasoning. I'd try a bit more cheese next time.

I made it and asked him, "How is it?" He said, "Can't speak ... I'm too busy eating!" Delicious! Flavorful and easy. Don't change or add a thing to this recipe. It's perfect as-is.

I was running low on salsa and didn't have any shredded cheese, but with a little improvisation it still came out great. Instead of cheese I topped the chicken with a blend of grilled onion, peppers and jalapeño. I also added some crushed pineapple to add a little sweet to the spicy. Finally, I decided to use the sour cream and mixed some more of the taco seasoning with it to add some extra kick. Definitely something I plan on cooking again! Yum! :)

I'm always on the look-out for a new chicken recipe since that is one of my family's main staple foods. So happy I found this one. I followed it exactly, except for cutting everything in half because I only had two skinless, boneless, chicken breasts left. Goodness, was it delicious! I will definitely make this again, with four chicken breasts next time. Thank you for sharing this with us.

I added queso on top of the chicken and then salsa on top of that prior to baking it. The chicken was so unbelievably tender and flavorful!! The queso had a great effect on the chicken. Made it with wild rice and sweet corn. I've never seen my parents eat dinner so fast!!

Made this last night with medium salsa. It had a little kick and we loved it.  I put it over brown rice, I'd add more salsa next time just so we can have more "juice" for the rice.

I love the crockpot idea as another viewer tried.  Will def. do that next time.

This was quick and easy!

Personally I would add a little salt to the chicken, too before adding the salsa. Otherwise it was great! The chicken was juicy and tasted wonderful!!!! =)

Very good and very easy. I put sliced avocado on top rather than sour cream and used mozzarella instead of cheddar because it's what I had on hand. I mixed the pan juices into a rice blend which was delicious. I also paired with spicy black beans. YUM!

It's hard to believe a recipe with 4 ingredients, and is ready in 25 minutes, could be so good. After making it a few times I did change it a bit. To cook the chicken more evenly I pound the thick side of the breast so the whole breast is the same thickness, then instead of 1 cup of salsa I add the whole jar (650 ml), the sauce is very good on rice. The thinner chicken only needs 25 minutes to cook.

Juiciest, most tender chicken breasts ever!  This would be a great dish to put out at a buffet for a party.  I served it with Quinoa and Black Beans from the Allrecipes website.  Just added some tortilla chips on the side for a flavorful, delicious meal!

I was surprised how AWESOME this chicken turned out.  Not a single complaint from my wife and daughter, and we made a variation of it a second time with shredded chicken and served over chips.  It is nice to be able to vary the intensity of the heat in this recipe.  My wife and I both liked it a bit spicier, but my daughter wanted it a bit milder.  Definitely a GREAT way to cook chicken and get away from the same ol' same ol' blah of "just baked chicken"

This can be cooked on low in crock pot also. I use frozen chicken. I put it in crock pot before I go to work and it is done when I get home. Delicious, the chicken falls apart it is so tender! Add 3-4 cloves of chopped garlic if you like.

The chicken came out very tender and very juicy :) Next time I would put some fried onions or something crunchy on top of the chicken, since it's so tender. I would recommend also leaving the chicken in the oven for an extra 10-15 minutes, for some reason the chicken took longer than I expected to cook properly. Can definitely see myself making this again!

My entire family really liked this! Very good. I use a taco seasoning recipe from this site, and let my chicken marinate in it for an hour or so in a ziplock. Thanks for the tasty and very easy recipe!!

I absolutely loved this recipe! My husband said it was hands down the best meal I've ever made! (And I cook every night!) I put the chicken in the oven for 30 minutes, added mexican blend of cheese after 25 minutes. I paired it with corn on the cob with spiced butter (paprika, oregano and cummin) and a can of black beans!

Excellent! Thought I had taco seasoning, but didn't so I combined: chili pepper, red pepper, Cayenne, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, fajita seasoning, black pepper and salt. Rubbed on chicken and slathered in picante sauce! We couldn't get enough!

Awesome! I used The best fresh tomato salsa on allrecipes instead of buying salsa. I used chicken breasts that I sliced so that the seasoning penetrates better. The cilantro gave it a great taste! Served it over spanish rice with sour cream. It was absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

I came home later than expected in the afternoon and had some chicken on the cupboard thawed and had no idea what I was going to make with it. I quickly got on allrecipes.com and this recipe popped up. It was delish! I basically poured on the taco seasoning and poured on the salsa. I made regular brown rice ( had no mexican rice on hand) and seasoned it with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. I sauted onions and a green pepper in butter and mixed it in the rice.I served the chicken on top. The dish was so flavorful! Definitly a keeper!

This is a keeper and I did try a reviewer's suggestion to shake chicken in bag with a packet of taco seasoning and pured salsa on bottom and top of chicken. Boneless and skinless that is cut open butterfly style cooks well in about 35 min. and over a few days in frig it makes an awesome "leftover."

I followed the recipe exactly other than adding a few more seasonings and parmesan to the crackers.  I must have done something horribly wrong because my chicken was awfully soggy at the end of the cooking time.  I was able to save it by broiling it for 3 minutes per side.  The flavor was amazing and even after the long cooking time and broiling the meat was tender and juicy! I will definitely make again but probably follow a few of the tips from other reviews.

Great quick and easy. Although I added a 1/4 cup of water and used Newmans own black bean and corn salsa. It was great. I think in the crock pot it would have been even better but i like this option for a quick meal.

This is a good recipe, but as is, you cannot taste the taco seasoning.  I like to coat the chicken in the taco seasoning.  Melt a little Tex Mex cheese, and we're good to go!  Very tasty!!

So easy and delicious! If you don't want it to be spicy go lightly on the taco seasoning. After the seasoning I squirted lime juice over the chicken before putting the salsa on. Served over rice and beans is the way to go!

Super easy and super good.  Would be very easy to make any number of breasts - about 1 tsp of seasoning and 1/4 cup of salsa and a handful of cheese.  I am sending to my kids!

This was a quick and easy recipe and it turned out well.  I added sauteed onion and hot peppers and used Pace Medium Picante Salsa.  When I made the recipe again with a different kind of salsa the result wasn't nearly as good so I'll stick with the Pace.

Liked the chicken and LOVED how easy it was!  I put crushed tomatoes on the bottom of the pan instead of spray, and added instant rice for the last few minutes- yum!  Next time I am going to go a little easier on the seasoning since it was a bit hot for one of my kids.  I also am going to try it in the crockpot in a couple of weeks and see how that goes.

LOVE this recipe! So easy to make and delicious! Living alone, its easy to portion out how much you want to make for one meal. I probably make this once a week.

I found this recipe a little over a month ago and I've made it three times now. I love it!! I followed other reviewers and used Rotel instead of regular salsa and have found it makes the meat more tender and flavorful, without the extra liquid in the pan. My favorite is to pair this with fiesta corn and rice... Delish!!!

We had this for dinner last night and it was a hit with my whole family!  It was simple and still tasty.  I served it with shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes on the side as well as black olives and the sour cream.  I made "Mexican corn" and "Spanish rice" to go along with it.

Honestly I didn't have high expectations for the outcome of this, but only because of its simplicity. It was delicious! I didn't make any adjustments at all. I served it with Spanish rice a green salad. It's a super easy and quick weeknight dinner.

Really like this recipe. Made it as recipe says but have also made this several times there after and have done different variations. I have cut the chicken into strips and added green, red, and yellow peppers and onions in the last 10 minutes of baking then put in soft shells with sour cream. Many options to do with this recipe.

GREAT! Saved time by slicing fat chicken breasts lengthwise in half to make four thinly sliced breasts, & at 15 minutes, they looked perfect for the anointing of the cheese. Used Taco Seasoning I from the site, excellent.

Very yummy! I thought I had some taco seasoning mix when I began to make this & realized I only had chili seasoning mix and thought-what the heck! I also used the slow cooker & prepared everything before church one Sunday-put salsa on the bottom, then the chicken coated in chili seasoning mix, then more salsa. By the time I got home the kitchen smelled very nice. The chicken was so good by itself that I forget to add the cheese, green onions and sour cream as a topping on the first taste. I made Spanish rice as a side dish. Will definitely make again with taco seasoning-but the chili mix worked great!

To say this recipe was super easy would be an understatement. I couldn't believe how easy it was to put it together. I didn't measure anything.I just eyeballed it. My chicken was a little thick. So I gave it a few extra minutes before topping it with cheese. I decided to eat it like a taco: with lettuce and warm flour tortillas. I also ate it with sour cream. Next time I'll try topping it with queso cheese and shredded cheddar. Definitely a good quick meal and it seems to be good when you have to feed a lot of people.

I used homemade taco seasoning from this site with this recipe and we rarely have any leftovers.  The chicken always turns out tender and flavorful.  My only complaint is that it's a little salty for my tastes.  Maybe I will try it with homemade salsa sometime so that I can regulate the amount of salt.

This turned out so good and SO easy and fast to make.  My hubby said to for sure make this again.  I normally don't prepare meals that are only a few ingredients and that are this simple as I love to spend time in the kitchen. I'm on phase 1 of the Adkins diet and can't have carbs so this was a perfect dinner for me.   I served this with 'Calabacitas Guisada' (Stewed Mexican Zucchini) from this site.  what a great VERY low carb dinner

A belated review, this chicken dish was excellent! I actually used the sour cream to mix into the salsa and create a thickened sauce the chicken baked in. Super yummy, and simple to make too!

Incredibly easy, it can't get much easier.  It is a bit bland, this could be improved depending on the quality of your ingredients.  But if you just care to get something on the table with little effort/time, this is tough to beat.

Quick and delicious! I had 3 chicken breasts thawed and had tired of the overused chicken recipes in my recipe box so went searching. Glad I did. This one came together so quickly and turned out to be just what I was looking for tonight. I had already put the chicken in the oven for 20+ minutes but pulled it out and added the taco seasoning on both sides. I also drizzled enough chicken stock onto the breasts to wet them enough for the seasoning to stick. after 40 minutes of cooking (total) I added shredded mexican cheese and covered with foil to rest. I served with home made mexican rice and carrots. YUMMIE!!

Super easy to make!!! Was looking for a new way to make chicken. My sister is on a health kick and i was cooking from her pantry. She had all the ingredients except tacos seasoning so i subed quesadillas seasoning instead. Smells amazing in my house! I served with a combo of roasted bell peppers, onions, and sweet potatoes with the extra quesadillas seasoning... I am so making this again

This recipe is simple, but very flavorful. My husband loves mexican food and he was very impressed. The taco seasoning baked into the chicken is very tasty. I will be adding this one to my rotation!

This recipe was super easy and fun to make.. I changed it a little by adding a little corn and black beans to the salsa before putting it over the top of the chicken. The chicken turned out super moist and was DELICIOUS!

Great meal, family goes crazy for it. I make my own fresh salsa rather than the canned salsa. Gives it a much fresher taste.

This was just okay. Made it exactly as written, and the chicken was nice and moist. I think the success of this recipe really depends on how good the salsa is, and mine was just okay. With homemade salsa, I think this could be four stars.

I've been making this for years, pretty much exactly as written. The prep is fast and no hassle and most of the ingredients are always on hand at home.  Perfect for a weeknight meal and a favorite in our house.  I usually serve it topped with sour cream and black olives.  I add add refried beans along with a shredded lettuce, cheese and pico de gallo salad on the side - just top with a little salsa/sour cream mix for the dressing and voila! you have dinner!

Sprinkle with taco seasoning!!???  I dip/drag the chicken through the taco seasoning; well-coated.  I use Trader Joe's taco seasoning mix.  This is fantastic.  So so so so easy and so so so tasty.  Thank you for the recipe!

I don't give many 5 stars but this deserves a 5.  It is the EASIEST and TASTIEST new chicken dish I've tried in ages.  Followed the directions exactly and it came out so moist and delicious.  What a treat.  I will definitely make this for company.  Do use the sour cream, whether light or Fat Free.  It has a nice toning down affect on the hot salsa.  WONDERFUL DISH!

I feel that this needs a little more spices. I used a medium salsa and it turned out better than if I used a mild one, I feel.

This recipe is so simple, but ridiculously tasty. I did find that I had to cook it about 45 minutes to get it up to 165.. seems like a long time for boneless chicken, perhaps due to the salsa.

So easy, everyone loves it. Comes together super fast on a busy weeknight. Pair it with some Spanish rice and a salad and you're done! I just eyeball the ingredients now. You can also assemble it in the morning and just pop in the oven when everyone gets home.

I took the suggestion of JOESTRATA, and merinated the chicken in taco seasoning & water.  I loved this, as did my picky eaters, but...  when i took the chicken out of the marinade, it no longer needed the salsa, so I backed off one star because without the salsa, it's not really "salsa chicken."  A side note: When I removed the chicken breasts from the taco seasoning marinade, they looked exactly like the chicken we see on the grill at Qdouba and tasted like it too.

I have made similar recipes, but this one was the best. I have two boys, 5 and 10 and they never eat ANYTHING I make. They actually loved this. Couldn't stop saying it was the best chicken I ever made. That NEVER happens. I had sour cream on mine, and it was delish. Thank you for sharing!

I was hopeful after reading such great reviews for this recipe.  I usually like to rate the recipe as written to give it a fair rating. I like that it is easy to make but I give it 3 stars because it sort of lacks flavor.  It was just okay for me.  Next time, I will experiment with different seasonings/salsa and maybe even pan frying it--that's how much I want to like this recipe.  But as written, it is jut ok.

I have never cooked such tender chicken in the oven EVER! Even after re-heating the day after, the chicken was so tender & juicy, I had to check to make sure it wasn't undercooked, lol.  I added some chopped onions & bell peppers to the pan and had to improvise w/the taco seasoning (mixed salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin & cayenne).  Skipped the cheese for a healthier option, but ended up cooking it for 45 minutes total since my chicken breast were huge.

I don't eat-a-the-meat-a but I made this for the 'rents and they were big fans. We had a ton of extra salsa and cheddar cheese already so this recipe is a good staple because we always have the ingredients. They said it was super tasty and my mom's coworkers were eyeing her leftovers with jealousy.

This chicken is so good!  I only used about half of the taco seasoning and 1/2 cup of the cheese.  My entire family loved it.  I served it with pinto beans, Spanish rice, and salsa to dip in.

I really enjoyed the basic recipe, adding the green onions and olives as some suggested.  I took a pork chop out of the freezer next day and, having some leftover taco seasoning, decided to use a similar method to cook it.  It was still partially frozen, so I started it in my toaster oven at 325 - after about 15-20 min, then I put some chicken gravy over it (rather than salsa) and put in the meat thermometer - for about 144.  I didn't add the cheese or anything else - but it was really moist and tasty.  Think I'll cook my pork chops in this similar fashion (maybe different seasoning and sauce) often.  Less trouble for one - and I cooked it on foil - no pans.

Absolutely delicious! I mean to serve it with sour cream but it smelled so good, I couldn't wait to eat and forgot. We had a broccoli/cheddar rice side dish. Fantastic!

Yum yum yum YUMMM!!!!! I didn't exactly measure out any of the ingredients as I made only 2 chicken breasts, but the combination of ingredients was fantastic! The only thing I did different was use cheddar and mozzarella cheese. I highly suggest eating it with sour cream. The first bite I thought it wasn't bad, but the more I ate the more I loved it! My husband had the exact same reaction. I am also in love with how simple it is to make! With 2 kids under 2 yrs, its refreshing to find new recipes that taste great but don't have me working in the kitchen for hours. This will definately be something we make over again it our house!

This is great- and it's delicious even without the cheese, if you're watching your calorie or fat intake. I cook mine with a bed of vegetables (whatever is on hand. Last night it was sliced summer squash, a red pepper, and a red onion). Yum.

My fiancé and I LOVED this dish!. So delicious and perfect as is. I used mild taco seasoning and medium salsa and found it to be the perfect level of flavor and a great compromise for my fiancé, who lives spicy food, and for me -as I do not share the affinity. Used fiesta blend cheese and topped with sour cream, sliced olives. Ate with Spanish rice and southwestern style corn as suggested. Perfect for satisfying that southwestern craving while providing a little variety from the usual tacos and fajitas.

This is a good recipe for slow-cooking shredded chicken for tacos or enchiladas.  I covered the chicken in taco seasoning, lined the bottom of the crock pot with salsa, placed the chicken on top, and added more salsa on it all.  Cooked on low for 6 hours; very easy to shred and a great taco meal!

Delicious, easy and healthy.  Hubby and kiddos asked for seconds.  I like my chicken marinated, so the second time I made it I marinated it in olive oil, lime juice and cilantro.  Then cooked as instructed.   Yum!

VERY good! My boyfriend ate everything! I put taco seasoning in a bag with water and the pork chops and let it marinade for about 30 minutes, but I followed everything else in the recipe. I'll definitely be trying this again!

I didn't have a taco seasoning packet, so I used a southwest seasoning blend from Penzy's line up.  This recipe turned out great!

Super easy recipes. Made it exactly, served with low fat sour cream, which I feel is a must with this. It added more flavor, plus I love sour cream! I'd make again! I served it with mexican rice.

This recipe was ok.  I liked that it was easy and I could easily adapt the recipe to serve 1-2 people.  I found it a little bland.  Maybe if I used the hot salsa instead of the medium it would be a little more flavorful.  Will make again, but not on a regular basis.

So good, so easy, so fast!   You really don't even need to measure anything!  :)  I also added lime juice to the chicken before and after I topped with salsa.  Oh, and I used the taco seasoning from this website-(Taco Seasoning I).  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe! It was HIT! Used Queso Fresco instead of chedder cheese and made our own salsa for freshness. And used organic fajita seasoning mix instead of taco seasoning. Didn't top it with sour cream. Served it with yellow rice, organic seasoned black beans, and had cheese quesadillas with sour cream on the side. Also had a chipotle sauce for those who wanted the chicken EXTRA HOT. :)

Very yummy recipe! My husband is very picky, but surprisingly he LOVES this! Instead of using chicken breast, I use chicken breast tenderloins. They cook quicker. I also add the taco seasoning in a zip lock bag and put the chicken in and shake it, it's a lot easier and coats the entire chicken nicely. I serve with Green Giant Mexicorn and Knorr Fiesta Sides in Spanish Rice. Makes a yummy and filling dinner!

Super easy and super good! I took the advice of previous reviewers and coated the bottom of the pan with salsa instead of oil/spray. Worked like a charm- chicken was moist and didn't stick to the pan at all! Perfect recipe for weeknights or dinner guests. Thank you for posting!!

Really similar to Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken.  Use if you don't have time to wait several hours.  Made by recipe...no changes except I used a salsa seasoning instead of taco.

This is a great recipe. I've already used it several times. It's very easy and very fast. I usually add more than 4 teaspoons of the taco seasoning mix, but that's really all I do differently.

This was so easy!  I loved it.  I also put some Goya yellow rice (just add normal mix ins, water, oil etc) & black beans in the same baking dish, and it became a one pot meal!

Really quick and easy. Made this as written with the exception of using low fat cheddar and low fat sour cream. Next time, I think I will use chile powder instead of the taco seasoning to make it even easier.

My husband and father-in-law both loved this one. Very rarely do they give complements, so when a recipe is "a keeper," it has to be good.

This dish is so easy and delicious.  I make it a lot.  There are others that call for lots more ingredients (cream cheese, broth, etc.) but I don't see any reason to tamper with this at all.  Couldn't be simpler and so tasty.

This was absolutely delicious!  I just sprinkled a little taco seasoning on to each side of the chicken.  I poured a whole 16oz jar of salsa on top instead of just a cup.  Add some mexican rice and a vegetable and this is a great meal.  Will be served again for sure.

Very tasty and very simple to make. It tastes like it's much more complicated than it is. My favorite salsa for this recipe is peach chapotle.

Excellent! I marinated the chicken in taco seasoning with a touch of cumin added. After an hour it was sauteed, the cheese added to melt and topped it with salsa. The suggested side dishes are perfect accompaniements. Tortilla chips also add to the experience.

This was super tasty.  I did most of the suggestions from 79shale97.  I used Rotel instead of salsa.  I also added my own touch; I sliced up 2 Pablano peppers and laid them on top of the rotel that was on top of the chicken.  My family loved it, even the little kids that are not into tacos.  Will definitely be making again

Very spicy! i think it's from shaking the chicken in the taco seasoning.  Not sure.  It was tasty, but a little watery the sauce.

An update: This is our go-to dish. We use different spiciness taco seasoning, all different types of salsa, etc. And it is a weekly dish, easy, and few ingredients. Can't beat that combo!

I love this recipe! It's so easy and very delicious. I used about half a bottle of salsa instead of just a cup, completely covering the chicken. The bubbling salsa is so delicious over white rice as a side dish. Yummm! Thank you!

This was surprisingly good, very moist and flavorful.  I put the chicken in the oven still frozen so waited about 30 min to put the salsa on then continued cooking until done.  I added cheese the last few minutes but forgot the sour cream.  I did however serve it with sliced avacado.  The whole family really liked it and I'll make it again.  Thanks!

When I saw this recipe I thought PERFECT!  I actually used the salsa on both sides and instead used Mexican cheese.  The kids ended up eating theirs as a chicken taco with the Spanish rice, shredded lettuce and whole wheat shells.

Liked crock pot version, easy way to get tasty shredded chicken for tacos or something.  Followed recipe exact and was delicious with homemade salsa.  It really will just depend on salsa you get.  I had leftover salsa and this is perfect way to use it up.  I will shred chicken and let sit in juices for last hour to get it more moist.

So delicious! Didn't have taco seasoning so I sprinkled the chicken with chili powder, garlic powder and seasoning salt then covered in salsa. I will definitely make this again and again.

Made this last night. I threw it all together (cept the sour cream) threw it all in the oven. Was fantastic. My husband and daughter loved it. We ended up putting this in taco shells and it was so good. Gonna make this a pretty regular. Super fast, super tasty

This menu is going into rotation!  So easy to make and so moist! I made rice with spinach and place the chicken over it.  Spoon on juice from the salsa!

Love Love Love this simple recipe!!! To prove to you just how good I thought it was...I am NOT a left over eater, but I ate ALL the leftovers from this. Of course, I forgot to buy taco seasoning but had enough seasonings in my own cabinet to make my own! YUMMY

Added black beans to the spanish rice, only slightly sprinkled taco seasoning on breasts before dumping salsa over them.  It was yummy.

Made this last night...Fabulous! I didn't make any changes to ingredients. I did rinse chicken then poured 1 pack of taco seasoning in ziplock bag to coat chicken on all sides. I poured a little salsa in the bottom of dish before I added chicken. I also used pepper jack cheese along with cheddar and sharp. I love this easy peasy meal!!

We eat a ton of chicken at our house so it's great to find a great new way to prepare it. The only thing I did differently is just throwing the cheese on  before throwing it in the oven (no need to add it 3-4 minutes before it being done). I just rubbed a bit of taco seasoning on the chicken breasts, topped with pace chunky salsa and then cheese. Turned out amazing!! I can't wait to try it again with maybe Mexican blend cheese or another flavor of salsa. This recipe is a keeper :) Thank you for sharing.

Used halibut instead of chicken and got rave reviews. I'll probably try it with pork loin chops next.

Wonderful!!!!  I like to beat the chicken flat with a meat mallet.  It makes it nice and moist and tender.  You can reduce the cooking time when you do this.  If the chicken breasts are really big,  I cut them in half first.  I used homemade salsa and a hot pepper cheese instead of cheddar.  Fab-U-lous dish

I have used this recipe many times with some additions.  I line my pan with foil and place the chicken in it and also add a whole chili on top of the chicken before I cover with salsa.  The chili is mild but adds a nice flavor.  I add the cheese at the end just to melt it on top.  Really is delicious!

I was looking for something to make with chicken and Spanish rice. I'm going to start out by saying I don't like Mexican food and I hate cheese. But my boyfriend loves both. THIS IS AWESOME. Its good but its so much better just because its so easy! I put salsa in the pan as someone else suggested and crumbled tortilla chips over the top.! I used mild salsa so it wasn't spicy. My boyfriend just said "That's definitely on the list from now on!"

This is so simple and tasty. I didn't have taco seasoning and only a little chili powder so I sprinkled that on the chicken along with some cumin. Not sure you could even taste it through the salsa. I crushed some corn chips on top of the salsa and baked it. Added the cheese in the last 10 minutes and served with sliced avocado, cilantro and sour cream, with fresh peppers and polenta as sides. Delicious!

This dish depends almost entirely on the salsa you use, so choose wisely... We were given a jar of salsa from a farmers' market and used it for this dish and it turned out really good. But when we ran out of that salsa, I didn't make this dish anymore.

I love this dish for how simple, yet good it is. It can be altered adapted many different ways, and is even impressive enough for last minute dinner guests. Next time I will poke more holes into the chicken to try to get some of the taco seasoning more throughout the chicken.

One of my absolute favorite go to meals now. I made this a couple of months ago and have probably made it 3 or 4 times since. I use my own homemade salsa. This is so super easy and you can't go wrong, yum!! We have spanish rice and corn on the side.

I added one chopped chipotle in adobo to the salsa for a little extra kick.  Then served it in tortillas.  Next time I'll add some green onions when the cheese goes on!

I loved it and better yet, my picky little kids loved it!  I did do things slightly differently - rather than salsa, I used a can of mild Rotel tomatoes.  I also sliced up some onions and put in with the mix.  I didn't put the cheese on at the end; instead I cut up the chicken and made tacos out of it with soft flour tortillas.  The remaining rotel and onions in the pan made a great topping for the tacos, and we added the cheese as a topping for the taco.  So easy and so good!!

I LOVE this recipe..... but I do have a few changes ;)  I marinate the chicken in a baggie with a can of rotel (we use original) and my spices (I use sea salt, black powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, chili powder and red pepper flakes). I make sure the spices/rotel is mixed VERY well before adding chicken. Allow to marinate in the fridge for a few hours and then put into baking pan, add salsa on top and bake according to original directions. When you go to add the cheese, we use mexican four cheese blend from kraft. The whole family loves this recipe and we serve it with corn and rice - YUMMY!

LOVED THIS! Used all of the ingredients listed, but did not measure, just eyeballed everything. So simple and full of flavor (I used a medium, chunky salsa). This got rave reviews from my hubby and even the little guy finished his whole piece. I will be making this often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Absolutely WONDERFUL -- I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe. I used 8 boneless, skinless breasts and 2 packages of taco seasoning -- shook it all up in a bag, put it in the crock pot on top of a thin layer of salsa, and then covered all with the rest of the 2 medium-sized jars of salsa. YUMMY!

Thank you Faye!  I made this last night and was a big hit with the family.  It was fast and easy.  I did have to increase the baking time by 30 minutes but I think that was because I had prepared it earlier in the day and it went from the fridge to the oven.  We also had huge chicken breasts so I cut them in half.  We have two boys ages 15 and 12.  The 12 year old is very picky and at dinner time he usually complains.  Not last night.  The chicken was very moist too.  GREAT RECIPE!  Will definitely make this again and again.  I am also sharing with friends and relatives.

This is an often-repeated recipe in my home. It doesn't get any easier, and this is loved by everyone in my family, too! There's really even no need to measure. Generously cover both sides of the chicken with the taco powder then pour the salsa over the top. The final cheese layer is simply sprinkled on as you wish and dinner is ready to go with whatever vegetable you choose. This is one of our favorites. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was pretty good.  I think next time I make it, I will use less taco seasoning and mild salsa.  It was a little too spicy for me.

Great recipe. I put a smidge more cheese on that is called for, but i find it helps hold the salsa in place. I've made this recipe several times and enjoyed it. Quite nice.

I thought this was very easy and quite good. I made it in the slow cooker using three in-bone chicken breasts. I put the chicken breasts in a bag with the taco season, then I placed in crockpot with about 20 oz of salsa (leftover fresh salsa). Everything cooked on low for seven hours. The chicken fell off the bone.

Always a hit here.  It's really hard to overcook the chicken with this for some reason.  I think it has to do with the salsa acidity.  I've found that the kick of the salsa mellows when cooked, so even a fairly hot salsa is tolerated well by all in our house.  Also, rather than taco seasoning (was out) I used cumin and garlic and it worked well.

I looked at reader reviews and modified the recipe by adding corn and black beans.  The chicken was moist and delicious - there were no leftovers!  Easy and quick - great recipe for a crowd too!

Tried this as written tonight.  Was very good.  I think next time I'll pound the chicken flat and marinate in the seasoning/salsa for a bit before baking - should reduce baking time by a lot.  Am excited to try this again with a pineapple or mango salsa!!  (also - would use low sodium taco seasoning in the future, too!) Thanks for sharing it!

I think it all depends on your salsa.  This recipe turned out well for me.    I didn't have taco seasoning, so powdered the pan with some cumin, chili powder, salt and onion powder, and threw down a little oil before I put the chicken breasts in.    No problems there.

This turned out great! I recommend using more taco seasoning. I used guacamole instead of cheese and served this chicken with refried beans. I cut the chicken up and mixed everything (chicken, guacamole, beans, and sour cream) together. I will definitely be making this again!

My husband is just learning to cook and very successfully made this chicken.  Although he lacks cooking knowledge, it turns out delicious every time.  I upped the ante and made the Mexican Cornbread II from this site as well.  What a treat!

One of my favorite meals...I serve it with white rice!  I use a can of rotel instead of salsa because it has more of a kick with the jalapenos than salsa does.

12-11-09: A friend of mine referred this recipe to me and it was so good!  I always make my own taco seasoning, so I used that (chili powder, cumin, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder).  I didn't have salsa, so I used a 10oz can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles and everything tasted delicious.  Next time, I will try this recipe as is with actual salsa. UPDATE 2-27-18, stopped making this recipe for some reason a few years ago, but made it again tonight and it's as great as I remembered it was! This time I combined a can of black beans (drained) and frozen corn. Spread on bottom of baking dish, added a couple Tbsp of water, and topped with a little taco seasoning. Then continued with the rest of the recipe, baking the chicken on top of the beans/corn! Excellent one dish meal! Goes great with mexican/spanish rice, cauliflower rice, or even a salad!

This is on a regular rotation at our house, and has been for years.  Serve it with Cornbread and salad for a  quick and easy weeknight meal.  The chicken always turns out moist.  I just liberally sprinkle taco seasoning on both sides without measuring.

The quality of this recipe is determined mostly by the salsa and taco seasoning you use. When made with homemade taco seasoning and homemade salsa, it's phenomenal. My husband calls this "Mexican Chicken Parmesan"... even with the cheddar/mexiblend cheese, it makes him think of a Mexican version of the popular Italian dish. Like others, I serve with Mexican-style rice and corn.

This was so easy and incredibly delicious.  My whole family loved it.  I used Taco Seasoning I and served it with Mexican Rice II, both from Allrecipes.  I will definately make this often.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I have already made it a few times. I cook just as the recipe says. Although sometimes I cut up the chicken to cook faster

Yummy!  This is such an easy and tasty dinner.  Very flavorful, and the chicken was not dry.  I will be making this a lot.  Next time I might add some lime juice.

I made this lastnight and it was absolutely delicious.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I served it with black beans and white rice and put the juices in the pan from the chicken over the rice.  This will be a family favorite.

Although I enjoy cooking, I am not very fast in the kitchen. So I am always looking for SUPER EASY and DELICIOUS recipes. Well, this is definitely just that. My husband and I LOVE this one! The chicken always comes out very tender with wonderful flavor following the recipe exactly as it reads. Thank you, Faye!

Very easy and pretty healthy to boot. Next time I will try marinating the chicken in the taco seasoning mixed with water to see if it flavors the chicken a little more. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Tasty, moist and super easy.  Put some salsa on the bottom and dumped the rest on top. Served with the mexican corn from this site which was equally good and equally easy.

This was great! I used homemade salsa and it was so juicy! Next time we want chicken tacos I think I'll make the chicken this way and then shred it when it comes out of the oven. That would be so easy and delicious

Being single, I tend to freeze meals a lot.  This recipe was great.  I put some salsa in bottom of crock pot, seasoned 6 pieces of chicken in ziploc bag with taco seasoning in it, placed chicken in pot and covered with the rest of the salsa.  Six hours later, I divided the chicken into containers with juice added in each.  Then froze.  They have been so good to take to work and re-heat.  I didn't use the sour cream at all.

Yum.  Used the plastic bag toss method with a taco seasoning recipe from this site.  Served with sour cream and guacamole, mexican rice from this site that I added sauted zucchini and pinto beans and steamed farm corn.  Really good summer dinner.  My 5 year old gobbled it up!

I make this all the time.  Delicious.  Best to pound the chix a little thinner and marinate in the taco seasoning for a cpl hours prior to cooking to get flavor more through the meat.  Use a nice salsa as well.

I actually found this recipe after I had made it, but it is exactly what I did.  It was incredible!  I did use Pace Salsa-Chunky that was medium heat (when it's cooked it doesn't have as much heat to it).  I did have sour cream with it and it was a nice addition.  It is a great recipe when you are in the mood for a bit of Mexican food but a little healthiness as well.

Very yummy!  I did not have taco seasoning, so skipped it, figured all of that sodium wasn't really necessary anyway!  I used my fav salsa (it's a seasoning mix that you add fresh tomatoes and lime juice to, fabulous with some kick and better than your average 'jar' salsa, not to knock them cuz there are good ones!).  I just realized that I forgot to add the sour cream at the end...next time!  Served with Best Spanish Rice from this site and steamed veggies, great meal!

Very yummy, quick, easy and healthy! I used less cheese and added a squeeze of fresh lime juice and some sauteed onions and bell peppers. Everyone loved it!

i can't cook chicken, it always dries out, but this worked and it was fantastic! i dredged the chicken breasts in taco bell seasoning. so easy, and so wonderful. i wanted to do a spanish rice side, but didn't have enough ingredients so i served it with some deluxe mac & cheese, and to my surprise it was a good combo! especially if you have kiddos in the house.

This is the best recipe, but remember to always pound the chicken.  It comes out way more tender and really makes a huge difference when cooking chicken any way...I always cook with black beans and serve with mexican rice.  Very good topped with a little guac.  I could make this every week.

I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it!  I ended up using 2 kinds of salsa (on each half of the pan) because that's what I had.  I served it with a corn bread casserole.  This is a keeper!

Wonderfully simple, and made up of things I sometimes already have in the kitchen. I used Taco Seasoning I from allrecipes, just lightly sprinkling some on and rubbing it in. You don't need much since it's such a strong flavor. I also like to use a combination of mozzarella and cheddar.

I'm giving it five stars because my kids loved it, and so did my husband.  I did do one thing that I won't repeat in the future - I took the advice that said to just put it in a bag with the taco seasoning.  It was too salty for my taste that way, so I'll follow the recipe to the letter next time.

This is by far the easiest and tastiest recipe I've ever made.  I've shared the recipe with friends and family and they all rave about it.  The only thing I do in addition is have soft tortillas to roll it up.  Add a side of mexican rice or southwestern corn-- perfect easy delicious meal!

This is a really easy and quick weeknight meal.  I just lightly tossed the seasoning on both sides, then threw the salsa on top.  I served with brown rice and black beans.  We will make this again.

This is so easy & so good! I sprinkled the chicken with fresh chopped Cilantro before I topped it with salsa. I made it last week & I'm making it again tonight! Thanks for a great recipe. :)

A wonderful, easy recipe! I know in my own home I always have these ingredients on hand and it was a nice change of pace from traditional chicken recipes.  My boyfriend raved about this recipe, went back for seconds and asked me how come I only made 4 chicken breasts!   I didn't have any taco seasoning packets at home so I made my own version. Sprinkled the chicken with Chili Powder, Cumin, Paprika, Onion powder & a little dash of oregano. Overall this tasted very similar to my enchilada recipe and had less work involved.   A definiate staple in my home from now on.

Excellent and easy! I make my own taco seasoning so I used that. I didn't change a thing to this recipe. It leterally took me maybe 3 min to throw it together. Next time I will add a can of chiles to the chicken. Other than that good to go.

I've made this many, many times now and it always turns out great.  However, I use frozen chicken breasts and put them in the slow cooker, but use the rest of the ingredients the same way.  It only takes about 4 hours on low for them to be cooked through.  They are always so tender...you definitely don't need a knife with these.  I usually serve it with "Best Spanish Rice" from this site.  It makes a great meal!

YUM YUM!!!  This recipe is amazing.  I have made it on several occasions and it just keeps getting better.  I use Jack's Special salsa that you can find in the deli area of Harris Teeter.  I think the quality of salsa you use is important.  I add sliced black olives on top of salsa and when done cooking I top off with sour cream and a little cilantro.  I would give this more than 5 stars!

I made this recipe last night (as directed) and was glad that I doubled it--everyone in my house loved it!  My daughter asked, "Are we having that chicken tomorrow night for dinner, too?"  When I said yes, she said, "Good! It was awesome!"  We're all looking forward to leftovers tonight.

This was quick, easy, tasty and tender!  I subbed Mexican cheese blend for the cheddar.I served this with Rice and Black Beans, from Rebecca Tally on this site, along with a dollop of sour cream. * note: I used Lundberg Wild Blend rice and made the beans separately.

This is one I go back to many times.  Good with rice or mashed potatoes.  I use more salsa, extra for the rice or potatoes. Even good without cheese and sour cream but the best way is as stated in recipe.

Yum. Made as written, except I marinated the chicken as suggested by other reviewers.  Only thing I'd change next time is to make my own taco seasoning.  We weren't too sure about the packet seasoning taste with the chicken.

This was Fantastic!!  I didn't really diviate from the recipe much, just used about half a packet of the taco seasoning, coated both sides of the chicken then used the rest of the taco seasoning along with a small can of tomato sauce and brown rice.  YUMMY!

This one was REALLY good!  I just fed a kitchen full of hungry teenage boys and there is none left and I tripled the recipe.  It is so simple but tastes great!!  Served it w/ a boxed Spanish Rice w/ sour cream on top.  Very, very good!!  I will add this one to our regular menu schedule.

A very flavorful chicken! Easy to make seeing you have all the ingredients on hand. I used the Taco Seasoning from this site and used homemade salsa. I should have pounded out the chicken breasts a bit cuz they took about 40 minutes to cook. Tastes great with the sour cream!

Family loves it. I marinate chicken in taco seasoning (with 2/3 cup water per package) for several hours before cooking. At end I take out all salsa, add about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sour cream, and pour back over chicken. Top with cheese and put back in oven for 3-5 minutes to melt the cheese. They love the creamy salsa mixture.

One of the best chicken recipes I've ever made!  The sauce turned my pan black, but it was worth it because the chicken was moist and flavorful!  I'm putting it in my favorites rotation.

I have to say, I was a bit skeptical, it seemed to simple to be a really great recipe. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of taking other's advice and marinating the chicken in the taco mix with about 2/3 cup of water. I also had some peppers and onions that were cooked and left from fajitas last night that I poured on top of the chicken while baking. This was really great! So nice and simple, and one of the nicest things was that all of the ingredients are usually in the fridge and/or pantry. Great addition to the list of meals we will enjoy over and over! Thank you

I LOVED this recipe! I am making it again tonight. My husband and daughter loved it as well. I did use a little bit more taco seasoning and cheese than the recipe called for though. Very simple, easy, and cheap recipe! We also ate Pasta Roni for a side dish.
Highly recommended!!  =)  Enjoy!

I had winged a chicken with salsa recipe before but it turned out bland. The taco seasoning adds a very good amount of tasty goodness to it all. Definitely a keeper of a recipe, and SO easy.

It was all right, but needed more seasoning.  Great with Spanish rice!  I seasoned with taco seasoning, extra chili powder, salt n pepper, and then stirred cayenne into the salsa before pouring.  Good stuff!

I made this recipe exactly as it is listed and it was fantastic! My husband has asked for this dish since I first made it about a month ago. It's so easy! I used whatever cheese I had, Monterey Jack and the salsa had a flavoring to it (Smokey Chipotle) to give it a variety. 
We're making it again tonight.

This was pretty good and extremely quick and easy to prepare.  I didn't measure however, I do believe I used a bit more salsa and cheese than the recipe calls for.

Nothing special. Use a good thick and chunky salsa. Very easy to make and will again.

This dish came out looking awesome - like I'd put 5 times more time and effort into it than I did! I seasoned it with a taco seasoning recipe from this site (though to be honest, On the Border's seasoning packet is still the best!) and topped it with homemade salsa, then cheese. Awesome served with Spanish rice and warm, buttered tortillas - and a great FAST and EASY weeknight alternative!

This was pretty good! I cooked it in the slow cooker as other reviewers had done. Didn't have a ton of flavor, next time I'll add more garlic powder and maybe some onion powder. For the flavor, I give it a 3, but the ease of the recipe can't be beat, so it gets a 5. I shredded the chicken and put them in corn tortillas with black beans and all the fixings. Couldn't get the 3 year old to touch it but hubby dumped habanero sauce all over his and loved it. I'll try this again for sure with a few tweaks.

I wish I could give this 10 stars. I use green chili sauce (friends in Mexico) and skip the sour cream and cheese - it doesn't even need it! SO GOOD!

This was delightful quick and easy dinner! Topped with fresh, diced tomatoes, salsa con queso (basically cheesy salsa), and served with rice makes this meal truly awesome.

This was quite delicious and I'm so glad I finally tried it.  I did use 6 fairly thick breasts which had to cook longer, and dried it out a bit.  Next time (and there will be a next time soon!) I will use smaller breasts or tenderloins to keep it moister.  Yum!

What a great recipe!!! It is the quickest chicken recipe ever and it had so much flavor too!  We used just two chicken breasts and still used the cup of salsa and it was amazing! Will make over and over again!

This is so great - easy and cheap! I didn't have taco seasoning, but I did have a chili seasoning packet - so I used that (just sprinkled on both sides of chicken) and used store-brand mild salsa and Mexican-blend shredded cheese. It was so quick to whip up & it ended up tasting almost like a casserole, which was very tasty, thanks!

I was very pleasantly surprised that this easy dish was so full of flavor. I used my homemade taco seasoning with no salt & had a wonderful smoky salsa that a local Mexican restaurant makes. Yum it was good. The leftovers made a great chicken enchilada casserole. Thanks!

Wow! What a GREAT and EASY to prepare recipe for chicken. My bf and I really, really enjoyed this. I scaled the recipe to 3 servings since I could only find a package of 3 chicken breasts (we could have each easily eaten two...). I was skeptical at first.... How good can chicken seasoned with taco powder, jarred salsa and cheese be? Boy was I wrong!!!!!  I made one modification - subbed taco seasoned cheddar cheese for the regular variety. Served this with taco rice and beer margaritas (also from this site). Thanks. This one's 'goin in the recipe file!

This was wonderful.  I took the taco seasoning packet, combined with water in a plastic zip lock bag and put the chicken in for a few minutes.  I put the chicken over a combination of brown rice and corn.  Squeeze a lime over the top and it's delicious!

I modified slightly by using 2 jars of my favorite salsa (Desert Pepper Trading Co.© salsa -medium) and 3 chicken breasts (6 halves) and homemade taco seasoning. I loved this recipe. Served with basmati rice and fresh spinach cooked in olive oil and garlic. Thank you Faye.

Very easy to make and tastes good too!!  I used fajita seasoning packet and black bean and corn salsa.  I served it over plain white rice for my husband and me and cut my daughters up and made a burrito out of it.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitley make it again especially when I'm short on time.

This was great, nice & juicy! I used the crock pot and  changed it up a bit to make it lower in calories. I sprinkled  each chicken breast with only 2 tsp. of taco mix. Then poured 1 can rotel in the slow cooker, put chicken on top. Cooked on low for 5 hours, topped with smaller amount of cheddar and garnished with jalapeno and sliced avocado.

This was tastier than I expected. The chicken breasts were very tender and juicy. I used the taco seasoning mix from this site which is so economical, convenient and better tasting than the commercial packaged ones. As expected the males of the family inhaled this meal. I served with plain rice but a spanish or mexican rice would have made a better side. Overall very enjoyable and super quick and easy to prepare.

5 stars for how EASY this is. Not a lot of thinking. Great for after work. Used taco seasoning recipe from this site. Too spicy for my kids - used Medium salsa. Next time I'll use mild. They ate it after I scraped off the salsa. Hubby liked it.

Loved it!  Used thighs instead of breasts (what I had on hand), but so easy and so delicious!

If I could, I would give this 5+ stars, I made it with boneless skinless Chicken thighs since I believe that chix breats are too darn dry (no matter how I cook them) & my family agrees! Anywho, Love the flavor. Thank You!! I'll be making this again...

WoW!! I had no idea this chicken would have as much flavor as it did! We were pleasantly surprised! I used 5 chix breasts, and rubbed an entire packet of taco seasoning onto it, & used about a half cup more salsa. Also double the cheese(I use 2%). And 2 TBSP of sour cream? i don't think so! That just doesn't cut it! This dish is definately being added to our "regular" recipes! Yummy! And so good for you!!

Excellent dish!  I was hesitant to make it because of its simplicity.  I did as others suggested: marinated the chicken in one packet of taco seasoning and 2/3 cup of water.  The chicken was very tender and moist, my husband gobbled it up!

My husband was a little skeptical with this one and I wouldn't even tell him how I was going to prepare this. He loves Mexican food and LOVED this chicken dish. After following other reviews about marinating the chicken in taco seasoning first, we found the chicken to be incredibly moist and flavorful. I think that next time I may try to use a peach or mango salsa to add a little sweetness.

Serve this over a bed of Spanish Rice and you have a winner!

My hubby loved this one. I didn’t have taco seasoning so I sprinkled cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper on both sides of the chicken. Pored the salsa and a little bit of water on top baked for 30min then put pepper jack cheese and mozzarella on top and let it melt. MMMM so good, I will defiantly make this again.

This recipe was great! I took an extra step and added a cup of light brown sugar and 1/4 cup (add to taste) of molasses with 1/2 cup of water and marinated the chicked for about three hours. The spicy sweet taste was just what my family was hoping for.

This was very good.  Whole family liked it.  Fixed it just as shown on the website, except didn't have the sour cream and used Mexican cheese instead of cheddar.  Definately worth your time to try.

Another easy chicken dish to add to my collection!  Great quick and easy weeknight meal. Made exactly as stated in the directions-and would do it the same way next time. I highly recommend the optional sour cream.  erved with "best spanish rice" from this site.

This is fast becoming a favorite in my house. I pour the taco seasoning packet into about 1/2 cup of chicken broth or water and let that marinate all day, instead of sprinkling the chicken with it prior to baking. GREAT TIP: for an easy side dish (esp. if you're eating low carb like me), combine 3 tablespoons of the salsa with two cans green beans, drained. Add a little salt and pepper and heat through for a perfect pairing.

My boyfriend and I loved this! I made a few little changes though. I completely coated the chicken with the taco seasoning, used Cabot white sharp cheese instead; which gives it a more mexican flavor and topped it off with some pepperjack cheese. Nice kick to it! The chicken came out so tender great dish!

This was good but too salty. I would recommend using chili powder, cumin, etc. to create your own low sodium taco seasoning. Using fresh salsa might reduce the salt too, but I don't like to bake fresh salsa. It seems less fresh.

Super easy and delicious! I put black olives on mine instead of cheese and use fat-free sour cream; my boyfriend skips the sour cream. My little sister reports good results using her Foreman grill, too.

Very good. I used chicken tenders. I didn't have any taco seasoning because most brands use MSG, but I made my own with some chili powder, cumin, orgeano, & salt & pepper. The chicken was so moist. It was a good change. I have to be honest - I do something similar in the slow cooker and then shred the chicken meat for tacos/burritos. But this is a good variation for when I have a lot less time.

Easy, juicy, and tasty! No taco seasoning on hand so I used a homemade taco seasoning blend. I accidentally baked it for 40 minutes, and it was still very tender and juicy. I will make this again.

WOW we loved it!  It was fast & easy, I like recipes that don't have to be followed to a T.  This is one of them, we will do again and again! Served over spinach and will make with rice as well next time.

this chicken is delicious!! I covered it when it was baking and just added to the cooking time and it was so juicy and the flavoring was so wonderful! Must be served over rice for best results I think!! Sooo good!

It was tasty. My 15yr old scarfed it down in a minute, and snuck the leftovers for breakfast. I liked it but I think next time I make it I'll make a few changes. I think I'll try the "chicken" taco seasoning instead of "beef" and instead of sprinkling on the chicken I think it would be better to put seasoning in a shallow dish and dip chicken in, or shake in a bag as others suggested. That way the excess falls off and you don't get a powdery taste when your dish is finished. Nothing major just a few tweaks, can't wait to try this again. Thanks!

My boyfriend said, "Before you even ask, 10 out of 5 stars." This was really good. I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site and served it with Spanish Rice II. It was awesome.

Very quick and easy, and very moist and flavorful. I used Taco Seasoning I, and I followed the recipe exactly, so I didn't marinate the chicken, and I thought it was plenty spicy. I did use a 4 Mexican cheese blend, and I used the sour cream. We loved it. I served it with Mexican rice and black beans.

Wonderful!  I love how simple this is - I was working with minimal supplies in the house. I ended up making my own salsa - crushed canned pineapple, cilantro, red pepper, onion, tomato. Served chicken on a bed of lettuce with toasted chips and guac. Delicious like restaurant salads.  Very tender chicken!

My husband & I both LOVED this recipe. I used chicken  breasts sliced lengthwise into tenders to speed baking and make smaller portions of chicken for each person. When I sprinkled the cheese on top in the last few minutes of baking, I also added some crunched up tortilla chips. I served this with bowls of toppings at the table:  little shreds of romaine lettuce, chopped tomato, sliced green onion, and chopped cilantro. As other reviewers said, this was a little hot, but we enjoyed it that way. I was really wishing we had some avocado to put on top -- would help balance the spicyness.  Guacamole would be great too. To complete the meal, I made oven fries seasoned with olive oil, seasoned salt, cumin and oregano.

I made this dish exactly as instructed, only I used Tex Mex seasoning, which is just a little different then Taco seasoning. Everyone loved it, including my very picky husband and teenage daughter. The timing was right on the recipe and the chicken came out nice and moist. I served it on top of plain rice, which worked well because as you cut into the chicen, the salsa and cheese mix with the rice. The kid didn't even complain that I used spicy salsa! I was actually asked to make this again!

Very yummy! I didn't make any changes to the original recipe and it turned out really well - and so easy. I also used Pace chunky medium salsa as recommended by others, and used low fat cheese and sour cream to keep it lite. I shared this with some of the ladies from my office and it was a hit with everyone. Served with Spanish rice and corn and black beans. This is a keeper!

I gave this 5 stars because its healthy and delicious!!!  I leave out the cheese and I bake the chicken breast in foil so that it comes out extra moist. Next time I will try it with peach or pineapple salsa for a tropical twist.

good, but not as good as i hoped it would be. very very easy to make, too. i doubled, almost tripled the taco seasoning and i think it made it tastier. i mixed hot and normal salsa for a spicy kick and it turned out great

The overall flavor of the chicken was wonderful. I used homemade salsa with lots of veggies in it and my hubby at them because they were covered in cheese. Next time I think I'll marinate the chicken ahead of time in the seasoning so that the meat takes on more of the flavor. Simple and easy - all the ingredients that I always have on hand.

Yummy!  And I don't even like chicken breast (I prefer dark meat).  My family was skeptical, as they usually are on "new recipe" night.  They loved it.  It turned out moist and full of flavor.  Super easy and fast too.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Very good.  I merinated the chicken breasts for about 2 hours in taco seasoning with about 3/4 cup of water added.
Put into a pan and added salsa on top and baked until done.  About 35 min.
Then added my cheese.
Topped with sour cream before eating.
Also made up some rice to go with it.

I had chicken breast with backs on, so used those.   I used Monterey Jack cheese, and it was amazing.   Tried to stop at only one, but no way.  Going to make it again tomorrow, WAY easy and so very good!

This recipe was really easy to make, and the chicken was tender and juicy. We had it with rice, and my husband loved it. I'll definitely make it again.

So good and so easy.  I used more salsa and cheese than recipe called for.  Reheated in microwave the next night and it was just as good.

VERY simple recipe. Taste was ok but not incredible. Would do this one again - may add something else to bring up more flavor (garlic powder?)..Served it with corn niblets and Mexican rice.

This was awesome! We all enjoyed it, even my young children. I accidentally misread the recipe and coated the chicken pieces in the taco seasoning, rather than sprinkling it with the seasoning. I thought it was going to be too spicy, but by using extra cheese than asked for and topping the finished chicken with sour cream (yummy!), it wasn't too spicy at all. This is a definite repeat.

Wow...who knew easy, could be so good! The family loved it.  I made it just as the recipe states - I pounded the chicken breast to make the uniform first though. Served with Cilantro Lime Rice on the side. Great recipe! This is a great recipe for kids to make, too. It's simple, but tastes really good.

An easy and very tasty recipe. Not at a spectacular-I-will-feed-it-to-prominent-guests level, but I would certainly feed it to family and friends without hesitation. I followed the recipe fairly closely, though I was making it for two so halved everything but the salsa, which I can't imagine only a cup of for a 4-person serving. I will definitely be adding this to my repertoire.

I did a different variation of this recipe--I used Pepper Jack cheese instead of Cheddar cheese and I used hot taco sauce instead of salsa.  It was very spicy & very delicious!

Quick and easy...  I think I'm going to look around for a different taco mix, or make my own, as I think what I used over-powered the chicken.  Otherwise, it's a convenient, flavorful way to serve Mexican-style chicken.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I put the seasoning is a plastic ziplock baggy, and put each chicken breast half in it seperately. Definitely don't need to "mild" it out - as the seasoning isn't very bold once cooked in the oven. This recipe is like healthy taco's! I served with a side of tortilla chips to dip into the extra salsa! Thank you!

My husband loved this. I loved that it was soooo easy. I used a gourmet salsa, which I think makes a big difference, I used a black bean and corn salsa and homemade taco seasoning from a recipe on this site.

We absolutely loved this recipe. Mostly me, because it was so simple to make. I used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from this site and the combination was fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be enjoying this for years to come.

I used Newman's Own brand salsa and I didn't measure the taco seasoning - I just made sure both sides of the chicken were covered. Used Tillamook cheddar cheese, which is always good. My boyfriend liked this dish, but I thought it was just ok. Underneath the salsa and cheese, the chicken just tasted like plain chicken. I had forgotten to top it with sour cream, but I don't think that would have mattered anyway. If I make it again, I will dice the chicken up into pieces and maybe use a different sauce, like the Rotel that other reviewers recommended.

This chicken was delicous! Seriously so tender and juicy and not at all dry. Cooked it exactly to the recipe, just added a little extra chopped tinned tomatoes to the sauce as we cooked extra pieces of chicken for more of the family. Served this with Spanish Rice II from the site and it was a great combo. Great new meal to add to our rotation. Thanks!

The chicken was very moist, I really liked it like this.  I just sprinkled the seasoning on, and I actually forgot about the cheese.  The sour cream and salsa made a nice little sauce though, and I served it with corn and brown rice.  Tasty!

This was just OK.  I was skeptical about trying it because it seems that most of the recipes we try with large amounts of reviews turn out just so-so. Same thing here.  It is quick and easy and tastes OK.  But the chicken was really dry and pretty mush tasted like chicken nachos.. I might make it again when I don't really feel like cooking.  But probably not anytime soon.

Very good. My daughter made this and it was easy. I served over rice with the extra sauce mixed in with it. Yum! My daughter seemed to like it the 2nd time w/o cheese better.

This one gets 5 stars for ease and popular appeal
...everyone loved it! I made the Taco Seasoning from this site and patted it all over the chicken and let is sit for an hour before cooking. Good  quality salsa is a must. It took a good 45min for my chicken to cook, but the breasts were large. A touch of fresh lime juiced over the top perked it up too!

This was really good.  I used only 2 chicken breast halves (it's just me and my husband), but used the full amount of taco seasoning and salsa (for 4 servings)  I also used fat free cheddar cheese and fat free sour cream to cut down on the calories.  I served it over brown rice and will definitely make this again.

This was even better than the last time I prepared it. I used chipotle seasoning mix, which I didn't measure, just sprinkled enough to lightly cover both sides and a shredded mexican cheese blend. The type of salsa can make a tremendous difference. Use one that's rich in flavor, as baking will alter the intensity.  Thanks for the recipe.

I seasoned my chicken with Southwestern spices instead of taco seasoning. I also used fresh salsa. Great recipe. My whole family ate it up.

A nice alternate for chicken. First I marinated my chicken in buttermilk for a few hours as I do with all my chicken(1cup milk 1 TBS vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk) for that extra moistness. I chopped up some fresh cilantro and added in with the salsa.  Topped with the cheese and sour cream this was quite tasty.  Served over rice.  I will make again.

This chicken was not only a healthy choice (I limited the amount of cheese I sprinkled on the chicken breasts), but a delicious dinner.  My family really enjoyed it - thanks for sharing.

This receipe was really good!  It couldn't be any easier.  For my boys (4 & 8), I cut up the cooked chicken and served it over tortilla chips and topped it with a little Ranch dressing.  GONE!  Yummy and easy and the kids ate it - doesn't get any better than that!

Good, basic recipe.  We added black olives.  Served it with salad and mexican rice, and put sour cream on top.  I think I'll make burritos out of the leftovers.  yummy!

I LOVE this recipe!  This is one of my favorite dinners to make.  I usually add a few potatoes and bake it covered for 45 minutes.  Then I take the cover off, add the cheese and continue to cook for 5 minutes.  I've tried it both ways - with and without the potatoes - and it's definitely better with.  It's also good with a few frozen green beans thrown in.  Great recipe - thanks for posting it!

I almost turned up my nose at this recipe because it seemed too easy, but I fixed this last night and I was pleasantly surprised!  It's great!  I used individually frozen  chicken breasts that come in a big bag.  I precooked them on my indoor grill, then followed the recipe exactly.  They were tender, moist and perfectly seasoned.  Everyone at my house loved this dish!

I changed this quite a bit, but it was really good!  Instead of chicken I used prawns and I sauteed them in the salsa and taco seasoning.  I served them with the "Quinoa and Black Beans" recipe, topped with a dollop of homemade guac and some sour cream.  I skipped the cheese.  This dish was to die for!

This recipe was fantastic!  I really didn't think I was going to be as crazy for this as I was, but boy, was I wrong.  I made it exactly at the recipe calls, but added sliced avacado on top of each breast, after it was cooked.  YUM, YUM!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe was spicy and flavorful.  I might use versions to make burritos or enchiladas and use another type of spicy/flavorful cheese to complement the other spices used.

I really liked this recipe!  Unbelievably good for something sooo simple! Although it has been stated to be too spicy by some, using mild salsa and limiting how much taco seasoning is used on the chicken will meet the approval of those with a more tender palate.  I used mild salsa and a whole taco seasoning packet and found the recipe to be delicious!  Definately a keeper :)

I am the title holder of the worse cook of all time so let me tell you how pleased I was when I received a call from my step daughter's mother.  She wanted this recipe!  HA...that's never happened before.  This is now a quick and easy staple recipe for me and my family.  I even cook this for dinner parties!

Easy and quick AND good - what a combination!  I had to make my own salsa, but it would be neat to try this with different salsas just for variety.  Serve it with rice, corn, and/or tortilla chips.  I skipped the sour cream because I didn't have any and I'm the only one in our house who likes it, but next time I'll have some on the side for me.

This dish is fantastic! I usually make a lot of this because for leftovers, I shred the chicken and serve them in tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes, & diced onions- an added twist to leftovers! I followed this recipe to the letter and it worked for me! For those watching your fat  intake, use low-fat cheese & sour cream, you won't miss the taste!!

Very tasty!  I used Pace mild salsa because my kids don't like spicy, but I think next time I would use a spicier salsa to kick it up a notch.  Served with Mexican rice and tortillas.  The sour cream dollop is a must!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe for the taco seasoning and use homemade salsa and it was AWESOME with this. I will definitely make this again. We cut it up and put it in tortillas with avocado and sour cream - YUM! Thanks for a great easy recipe!

I only made this recipe because it received so many great reviews.  The combination sounded a little unappetizing to me but I have to say I was intriqued by all of the 5 stars.  Much to my surprise, this was delicious and will soon become a staple in my home. Thanks for the great recipe!

Four stars for Ease. SO easy!  However, this is only as flavorful as your favorite salsa.  I used chipotle salsa, which gave it a little smokey, roasted pepper flavor.  The thicker the salsa the better, as there was a fair bit of juice in my pan (about halfway up to the chicken).  Tasty.

This was okay.  It was easy to make, but not all that.  I followed the suggestion of others and did the shake n bake technique of coating the chicken pieces and used a whole jar of salsa.  I may try it again with a different salsa, but not anytime soon.

Thanks Faye for a wonderful recipe.  After reviewing others suggestions I made a few modifications.  I used more salsa, I used chicken tenderloins, I also added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the recipe for baking.  Since my tenderloins were frozen I cooked for an hour with aluminum foil cover.  After 1 hour I removed the aluminum foil and covered each tenderloin with slices of jalapeno montery jack and mexican blend cheese.  I also served these with the perfect baked potato (on this website) and refried bean with mexican cheese.

This chicken  is super easy and quick.  And it tasted delicious too.  We ate it just as is one night, and the next night we chopped it up and wrapped in tortillas with some black beans and avocado.  Great chicken!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty. I didn't use the taco seasining. Instead, I mixed in a couple tsps of brown sugar in to the salsa, and sprinkled the chicken breasts with garlic powder. I used Kraft Tex Mex cheese for the topping and it was really yummy! Served it with Oven Roasted Potatoes from this site.

This was fantastic!!  I used one of the Taco Seasoning recipes from this site because I didn't have any on hand, and served it with a Corn Casserole recipe (also from this site!), and it was just like a Mexican Restaurant in here last night.  I think I was a bit too heavy on my spices, but with a dollop of sour cream on top of the chicken, it was scrumptious!  Just goes to show that a really great dinner doesn't have to take a whole lot of time to prepare.

This recipe was quite good.  I used a medium salsa and monterey jack cheese with jalapeno's which gave the dish a delicious spiciness.  I assembled it the night before and popped it in the oven after work.  I'll certainly make this recipe again.

Very quick & easy meal that is nice for evenings when you don't have much time to cook.  I used a chunky salsa and doubled the amount.

Whole family really liked this one.  Used a combo of cheddar and pepperjack cheeses.  Will be making this one again.  Served it with the Spanish Rice Original on this site.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted good to boot.  The only change I would make would be less taco seasoning (actually I think I will omit it altogether - it's too overpowering for my family).  The chicken turned out very moist and all in all, a pretty good recipe.

This dish was very good. I covered it in foil through most of the cooking until the cheese was added. It was very moist and tasty. Was excellent with Spanish Rice and nachos :)

This recipe has made it to our monthly menu list!  I do leave out the taco seasoning as the chicken gets great flavor just from the salsa alone.  One thing that I do differently is to make it in the crock pot- it's easy and I can get it ready in the morning and it's ready when we get home.  Cook it on low for 6-8 hours, transfer to baking dish, top with cheese and bake for a few minutes until cheese is melty and you are good to go!  Even my picky husband who hates salsa loves this.  We serve it with cheesy mexican rice.

This was good but not perfect. The thing that bothered me was that the chicken went a bit dry. I recommend wrapping the casserole in tin foil to keep the moisture in and only bake open once the cheese is on.

Was very easy to make and soooo delicious! Just one tip for parents of smaller children though. Don't use as much taco seasoning on their chicken breast portions. Can be a little too spicy for them.

Very good!  I did what another reader did "cut the chicken in large strips and coated with the taco seasoning. Then mixed 1C Minute Rice with 1C water, the salsa, about 1C of corn, a chopped jalapeno, and a dash of cayenne. Poured the rice mixture into the pan, then topped with the spiced chicken. Baked for 35 minutes, then topped with 1C crushed tortilla chips and a mixture of Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese, and baked for 5 minutes. It was SO good. Served with sour cream on top."
I woulld add just a little more salsa next time.

Very simple recipe, I used half the pack of taco seasonings though and added some green chiles and a squeeze of lemon juice and it added the right amount of kick. Went well with leftover penne pasta---thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe! I followed the advice from another review and added the juice of 1 lime to my salsa before covering the chicken with it.  I also used a low fat mexican cheese blend and low fat sour cream for the topping.  It turned out juicy and moist.  Definately making this one again soon!

This was really good, quick, easy, and healthy (when only a sprinkle of cheese is used - 1 cup is too much, in my opinion). I will make this again. I served it with g-ma's rice and black bean and corn salad II, both from this site. Great meal! By the way, once when I was in a hurry I made this in a frying pan (cooked over low heat w/ a tiny bit of olive oil) and it was almost just as good - I'll probably do it in a pan from now on because it's faster and not noticeably different in taste from the baked version.

This turned out very good.  I do Once A Month Cooking (Freezer dinners) and it worked out very well for that.  I used Medium Salsa and it had a little "kick" to it.  I will make this one again.

Just tried this tonight! Wow! My family gave it thumbs up! Hubby wanted to know where the recipe came from...how many men (sorry guys!) really care!  This is definately an add on to my dinner menu! The chicken was so tender! I took the advice of another "rater" who put the taco seasoning on the chicken & let it set for a while in the fridge for a few hours.  Thanks Faye!!!   Thanks All Recipes!!!

Great flavor! I've tried this recipe before, but the one I used didn't call for the taco seasoning, so it was alittle bland. This recipe however was yummy.

SUPERB! I was hesitant to put so much salsa on, but was glad that I did (actually, a little more would be good). I used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from this site and it was fantastic! Served with "Spanish Rice II" from this site, which was to die for! Next time I serve this (and it will be soon) my husband would like to use breast strips instead of breast halves so that he can make tacos or burritos.  The sour cream was a perfect topping. I'd give this 10 stars if I could! Thanks Faye!

Not quite as good as I expected it to be, but still pretty good.  Plus, so easy.  I poured the pan drippings into a skillet and added some cornstarch and water for a quick sauce.

I had lost this recipe and now that I have found it again I'm making it all the time. It's so easy to do and even company love it.  I have done it up and seared it on a hot cast iron pan and then used it for fajita's.

This was okay.  We love Mexican and this did not live up to the hype.  I had to cut up the leftovers, add more seasoning, and use for tacos.  Will not make again.

Very simple recipe, but needed a zing. I added a layer of pickled sliced jalapenos to the bottom of the baking dish, and a dash of cayenne pepper to taco seasoning. Came our delicious. Thanks, Faye!

This was a really good recipe. I didnt think it would be as good as it was. I used mozz. cheese instead of cheddar- Very suprisingly delicious!!! I also made this with the Best Spanish Rice from this site! Thanks for the recipe, will be making this again and again.

Easy and delicious!  I made them up ahead of time except for the cheese and popped them in the freezer in individual dishes once I had confirmed they were good.  Now whenever I want a meal almost totally prepared I pull out as many as I need. Just have to add the cheese at the end of the baking time.  And Monterey Jack with jalapenos is delicious too!

Very tasty and quick chicken recipe. I usually cook my chicken in crock pot first so that it will be juicy and tender. Goes very well with spanish rice.

This is a great recipe!  I served it to my boyfriend's family with rice and corn.  The chicken was so good!  But, we had to use a lot of sour cream to cut the hotness of the taco seasoning.  I would recommend to anyone trying the recipe to **taste** the taco seasoning first before they put it on!  That way you can adjust the hotness.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I thought it was tasty, but I really appreciated how fast this dish went together.  Like others have mentioned, the sauce was good over rice.  Next time, I may use more salsa so we have more sauce at the end.

Yum!! This was wonderful and I did serve it with Spanish rice and mexican-style corn as the author suggested. I left the cheese off to save fat and calories and it was still delicious! Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is SO easy to cook and it turns out just delicious! Sour cream is hard to get for me, so I did not add that. I added a little yogurt to the chicken and it came out really tender. A to-do again!

This was very good and easy to prepare.  I made it with the Mexican Rice 2.  I also shook the chicken in a bag w/ seasoning, it's easier.  However, if you have a sensitive stomach, stay away.  Both my husband and I did not feel well afterwards.  I won't be making it again.  Too bad, though.

Great change of taste for baked chicken.  It is so simple, I feel like I should have thought of this myself.  But many thanks to Faye for posting it!  I shook the chicken in a plastic bag with the taco seasoning to coat very well and used homemade salsa.  Will definitely make again.  Obvious, but worth stating, you must use a salsa and seasoning mix that you like the flavors of because both tastes are quite strong.

This is the kind of recipe I love to come across.  Delicious, easy, fast, and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  I used chicken tenders and cooked about 15 min on 375 degrees.  I also used "On the Border" medium salsa, which we love.  My son, who doesn't care for chicken, loved it too.

Excellent! Thank you Faye! Since there is some discussion about the type of salsa you use affecting the outcome, I wanted to mention that I used El Torito brand salsa (mild) and it was wonderful (I used the entore jar, rather than just one cup). I agree, it doesn't even need the cheese if your counting calories.

The recipe was easy to make and very tasty.  I used the spicy taco mix and extra cheese and my husband asked to have it on our menue plan for the month.  I served it with spanish rice and corn.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome.  Flavorful, moist, and smelled great while cooking.  I served it with rice & refried black beans.  One note if you're watching fat/calories - it doesn't even need the cheese.  Will absolutely make again!

I found this to be quick, easy, convenient and tasty.  Although it seemed to turn out a little too runny for my liking, the juices, nevertheless were quite tasty and were great served over a bed of hot rice.   I used On The Border Mild Salsa.  My kids said they really liked this dish, so I may make it again in the future simply because it is a fast and very healthy, hot meal to prepare amongst our busy schedules.

This was good. I didn't have taco seasoning. I just sprinkled the chicken liberally with chili powder, garlic salt, cumin, black pepper, and red pepper. I used a medium salsa and cooked for the indicated length of time, served with yellow rice, beans, and mexican corn. The medium salsa lent a lot of heat. I would recommend serving with sour cream to cut the heat (I didn't have any). There are other chicken recipes I like better but this worked well as a recipe using only what I had in my cupboard.

This is quite tasty. I used a jar of taco sauce instead of salsa and I generously poured it over the chicken.  I also use more taco seasoning to coat as I think it adds more flavor.  I've also tried this with boneless pork medallions and it's a wonderful alternative to the standard pork chop fare.

This was good and very easy to make but I think the taco seasoning was a little overwhelming.  I would leave that out next time.  I used the salsa jack cheese previously recommended, which tasted good.

This is one of the only recipes I have that I keep making again and again. It's just so easy, tasty, and healthy. I usually leave off the cheese and sour cream, and top the breasts with cottage cheese to make them even healthier.

We love chicken made this way because it is low fat, quick and easy to prepare, and best of all yummy to eat.  This is now one of my most requested recipes since the first time I tried it in 2001.  I do cut the chicken in smaller pieces to reduce baking time.  Also use more taco seasoning and salsa than the recipe suggests.

This recipe was very good, I substituted chicKen legs for the breasts and i wouldnt recommend doing so. I even marinated the chicken for 2 hours in salsa first. Very tasty though, will make again with breasts...thanks for the new taste on chicken!! (update)I passed this along to a friend who made it the suggested way and she said that her whole family loved it!!

Delicious!  One of my favorite recipes that quickly became a regular at my house.  I like that it is so easy to prepare.  My husband absolutely loves it.  I usually make extra so I can make chicken burritos for dinner the next night.  This is definitely one you should try.

I was very surprised at how this recipie turned out.  The meat was very tender and juicy and had a whole lot of flavor.  This recipie is nice also because you can adjust the "heat" to your preference.  I used mild salsa and I still found it had a little bit of a kick to it (because of thr taco seasoning).  This was also one of the easiest recipies to prepare, takes less than 2 minutes.  I will definetly be making this one a regular in our house.

This recipe couldn't be any easier and the taste was fantastic!  We made this for the in-laws when they came to visit and my food snob mother-in-law even loved it.  I wouldn't give her the recipe because I wanted her to think I had slaved all day to make it!

I've had this recipe on file for awhile and finally got around to using it. I'll tell you what, don't wait as long as I did, this one is outstanding! I used Lawrys hot taco mix, Pace hot picante sauce, and sharp cheddar cheese. Serve with refried beans and rice-a-roni, and it's a little Mexican feast!

I couldn't believe how good this was!  I threw it together thinking it would be an okay, last minute type of dinner.  Boy was I wrong!!  It was wonderful!  I served it with canned refried beans and I made some spanish rice.  It was a delicious meal!!  I will definitely make this again.  I'm glad it was so easy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

this is a pretty good recipe but i would increase cooking time. i had to cut into my chicken (which was still quite pink) and it ruined the cheese/salsa. otherwise the flavor was a pleasant change from beef

This was good, and, more importantly, so easy to make! I used an entire package of Lawry's taco seasoning. I also used the refrigerated kind of salsa that you find in the deli section, so I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than called for, and use a turkey baster to get rid of the excess water. My boyfriend loved it, I loved it -- try it, you'll be glad you did.

The thing I liked best about this recipe is how easy it is!!  Though I did adapt it a little for my own taste (and weight loss issues :0) and used reduced salt taco seasoning, fat free sour cream, and no cheese and it was still wonderful!  We had it with refried beans and baked tortilla chips.  Was sooo yummy! Definately a keeper

Very good.  For as simple as this recipe is, I was quite impressed with the taste!  I used Pace Thick and Chunky Mild Salsa.  I had to scrape off the "chunks" for my kids - they loved it!

Can you say WOW!!!! We all just loved this. My 7 yr old is very picky but she loved this. I made it with a mild salsa from the store which I think helped make it not too spicy for her.This will be on our table again!!!!!

I made this lastnight and it was great.I made it with Mexican rice and salad with artichokes-both from this website.I have 7 kids and only one liked it but that was because of the salsa turned off the other kids. This was so good and the easiers recipe i've ever made.

Made this again tonight for the first time in years.  Stuck to the original recipe but made some minor changes that I felt really elevated it.  I shook the chicken in a bag with the taco seasoning as so many recommended and marinaded it in the seasoning and salsa for about 4 hours.  I used a mixture of hot and medium salsa and I topped it with homemade Ranch dip instead of plain sour cream.  Served over taco rice and with a refreshing cucumber salad.  It was delicious.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried! I have made this 3 times in two weeks, my husband announced it's his new favorite! The only change I made was using more taco seasoning to suit our taste. Lots of Salsa and Cheese you can't go wrong! This will be a regular in our house!!

This is a super easy recipe.  My husband LOVED it, and it was a nice change of pace for us.  My kids wouldn't eat much of it, any they aren't too picky.  It would be a great main dish for an adult dinner party, though.

This was just wonderful!!  It was so simple to make.  I shook the chicken with taco seasoning in a bag, a great idea - thanks to whoever thought of it!  I didn't think the kids would like it but I was wrong, maybe I'll use an extremely mild salsa next time for my extremely mild children... So simple, so good.  Served with recipe 'Best Spanish Rice'  All around fabulous!

I didn't share the same rave opinion as other reviews.  This was just ok and probably won't make again.

Easy recipe! My husband and son loved it.  I used Monterey Jack cheese with a little bit of cheddar and it was even more authentic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really great recipe!  So simple and tastes delicious.  I make plain rice and top it with the chicken and warm salsa mixture.

I did what a few others said and coated the chicken with the seasoning by shaking it in a bag - This was great and will definetly be made often in our home - There were no kids home the night I made this so I really cannot say how they would feel about it - Thanks

This is one of the best recipes I've come upon.  Everyone loves it.  The kids love it too.  It reheats (if there's ever any left) great in the microwave.  I use a mild salsa.

This was a fabulous and EASY recipe.  I took the suggestion of "shaking" the chicken with the taco seasoning in a ziplock and that worked great!  Also used Rotel & Salsa which gave it an excellent flavor.  Used Mexican shredded cheese at the end.  YUM!  I had one left and ate it the next day for lunch, great leftover meal too!

I got married about eight months ago.  My husband is the cook of the house and I have never really cooked. I made this chicken and corn and mexican rice by El Paso and He loved it.  Unfortunately, he thinks I can cook now, but other than that this was great!!!!!!!

This was wonderful.  I put the taco seasoning in a bag, added the chicken and shook the bag to coat the chicken.  I put half the salsa on the bottom of the pan before adding the chicken and the other half on top.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only change I would make is to cut the taco seasoning in half.  We both had tummyaches after dinner that I think was associated with all the spices.

5 stars across the board!!  What more could you ask for...absolutely moist & delicious and incredibly easy!!  I spread the taco seasoning on each piece of chicken using the back of a spoon, and it wasn't "overpowering" at all.  My husband is not generally a fan of taco seasoning or salsa, but even he like it. A definate keeper.  This is even a perfect recipe for an informal dinner with company.

Hubby loved this dish.  Hes always been a spicy food lover.  I thought I had taco seasoning already but it turned out to be chili seasoning, so I used that instead.  Was very good.

Ok, this is definately one of the best chicken recipes we have ever tried!  One of those really good, really easy ones that almost makes you mad you never thought of it before!!  It was so very moist thanks to the salsa on top of each breast, and it was easy to make 8 breasts with one packet of taco seasoning, which was wonderful for leftovers.  I highly recommend this one, you won't be anything but happy!

This was so easy, so quick, so juicy, so tender, and so flavorful!  I loved it!  I used hot taco seasoning and kind of rubbed it on the chicken.  I used Tostitos Salsa (medium) and Kraft Mexican shredded cheese (Four Cheese).  I couldn't believe how juicy it was!  I served it with corn and mashed potatoes.  I can't wait to have it again!

I'm usually a from-scratch chef, but the huge number of positive reviews convinced me to give this a chance.  It is TERRIFIC!  Based on suggestions from other reviewers, I used extra taco seasoning and shook it in a bag with the chicken, and I spread extra salsa on the bottom of the pan instead of greasing it.  Unbelievably easy and delicious!  This one has a permanent place in my quick-meal toolkit.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Like other reviewers suggested, I poured salsa at the bottom of the dish and put the seasoning in a bag to coat the chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I threw everything together, frozen chicken tenderloins, taco seasoning, green salsa, frozen southwest (corn/pepper/blackbean) veggie mix, raw onion, cooked in a casserole in the microwave.  Then added diced, tomato, cheese, sour cream and olives, and heated to melt.  20 minute dinner for hubby and I over shredded lettuce and tortilla chips.

WE loved this recipe!! The chicken was sooo tender and juicy!! I wanted mine to be a little more spicy so I poured the taco seasoning into a ziploc bag and shook it all over the chicken, I also used 1/2 cup hot salsa with 1/23 cup medium.. It was so freakin delicious.. My husband wants it again next week.. I also added some sliced olives on top of the cheese and served it with warm garlic and cheese quesadillas... WE forgot the sour cream, it didnt need it, but we will try it next time... Definitely 5 stars!!!

This was the first recipe I tried from allrecipes.com and was I not disappointed! I used  more taco seasoning and salsa then called for in the recipe but otherwise I did it just like called for by Faye. The result? Incredible super tender chicken with a wonderful taste which I combined as suggested with some instant Spanish rice and corn. I will be making this often!

I've made this a couple of times, and it is really wonderful. So quick and easy!!! I do use more cheese, more taco seasoning{I roll the chicken breasts in the seasoning} and use 2 cups of salsa. Try it, you'll like it!!

This was a truly super recipe!!  The salsa was watery at the bottom of the pan (more like half the pan), but I think that's because of the brand I used.  In New England, it's so hard to get any descent salsa besides making it.  I took it to a party after doubling the recipe, and everyone loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was really quick and easy. I thought it 
tasted really good, but it was a little too
spicy for my husband and way too spicy for my
3 year old. I used Pace medium, I'll try a 
different kind next time.

This recipe is very good.  We are watching how we eat so I use fat free cheese and low fat sour cream which makes this recipe legal for us.  I shared it with my daughter and she has made it several times also.

Wonderful recipe.  And so simple.  I made it with a combination of 3/4 Pepperjack and 1/4 Cheddar, and then broiled it for a minute at the end to brown it.  It was great!

Living in the southwest we roast our own green chilis. Placing a cleaned and seeded chili slice on the chicken when you add the cheese, kicks it up a notch.

I tried this recipe last week and it was wonderful!  The chicken was very moist and tender. I used a Fiesta Picante sauce. Next time I make it, we are going to slice the chicken and put it on some warm flour tortilla's.

Made this recipe this weekend and it was a major hit.  I used chicken breast and thighs on the bone and it was fantastic. I even had to hide  one piece for my lunch this week or they would have gobbled that up too.

This chicken was amazing! I decided to use boneless thighs, and cooked it in my Instapot with the pan. Before I topped with cheese, I crushed some tortilla chips, topped with cheese and popped it under the broiler. OMGOODNESS, this was amazing over rice!! Oh and the only salsa I had was Mango Peach, I’m so glad it was!!

One of my New Year’s goals was to cook more meals at home. I also cleaned out my cupboards and am trying to use ingredients on hand. I had a jar of peach salsa and found this recipe. I had taco seasoning but instead used some Caribbean seasoning with curry (a giveaway from a cruise) since it seemed like it would pair better with the sweetness of the salsa. It was delicious. So juicy and tender and hardly any prep work at all. Next time I’ll make with a more Mexican flair using ingredients as listed.

Not a gourmet delight but adequate on a day when you don’t want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen and a nice break from other chicken recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly and added corn and zucchini as sides.  It was easy to prepare and the clean up was minimal.    I will probably prepare this recipe again.

This was very good as is and is even delicious as leftovers. We also had it with canned corn. I mixed the corn in with everything. But next time I’m going to add black beans and make homemade Mexican rice. I used my new multi cooker so we just sprinkled the cheese on our plates. But this definitely a great meal that is able to be eaten as is or it is a simple recipe that can easily be expanded.

I followed the recipe with one exception. I butterfly cut the chicken breasts and stuffed the center with cream cheese. It turned out great with the medium salsa that I used and put the chicken over Spanish rice. I wanted to drink the sauce that the cream cheese and salsa made mixed together... YUM! I will definitely make this again! This meal was even a hit with my picky eater (husband).

First and foremost, THIS IS SO easy and easy cleanup as well. I used a chunky green salsa and kicked the dish up by stuffing the chicken breast with a whole green chile stuffed with jack cheese.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar to the resulting juices to mellow out the acidic salsa.  It was phenomenal and a new favorite.

This was so much better than I was expecting!  I made this in my ninja crockpot on the bake setting.  It turned out so good and the chicken breast wasn't dried out at all.  Loved the flavor!  It was also really good today reheated for lunch!

Excellent as the recipe says.  I covered the chicken with tinfoil for the first 25 minutes.

This is only getting 4 stars because its so much better and easier in the crock pot than the oven. We just throw the chicken, taco seasoning and sala into the crockpot and let it do its thing. It then pulls apart and goes great in sandwiches or wraps.

I made this dish exactly as recipe noted. I did add some crushed tortilla chips when I added the cheese. I served over white rice and it was delicious!  Hubby had seconds so I know he liked it too.

Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  We have had this dish twice, and it is definitely in the favorites rotation.  The side dishes were Mexican rice, refried beans and sour cream.  It was a big hit!

Super Easy.  Tasted Great.
In addition to the 1C Salsa, I added 1C Pico de Gallo.
Definitely a do-over.
Next time, I am going to try using as slightly bigger dish, & add a can of Black Beans & another of Corn, all in the same dish.

Very easy and tasty.  Follow the directions but subbed a few ingredients.  I used chicken tenders, a can of Rotel  and a only a 1/4 cup of salsa.  Served it with Mexican Rice and and a southwest veggie mix.

This is a great and easy classic with few ingredients! We did the recipe as is essentially except added browned chopped onions and garlic to the sauce mixture. Delicious! We served it with cilantro lime rice.

It’s a good starter recipe. I coated the chicken in a taco seasoning, fresh garlic and added lime & lemon juice. Boneless chicken can be thick pieces so I sliced them in half to keep up with the cooking time. I added black olives and corn to the salsa as well. I served this with Spanish rice and a lime slice with fresh cilantro on top.

A great base recipe. I fixed it according to the recipe for the first time (maybe adding a bit more cheese because who doesn't like more cheese?) and it came out pretty good. I will definitely make this again with some add-ins.

Delicious!! I did mine in the Instant Pot and then topped rice with the chicken, juices, and cheese in the oven for 20 minutes. The sour cream on top was a great addition too.

Used chicken taco seasoning instead of plain taco seasoning and i used the entire packet. Also, I poured the entire jar of salsa over the chicken instead of just using 2 cups. The chicken was yummy and  well seasoned. I will make it again!

Love this simple recipe. I have made this as described many times. I recently used boneless chicken thighs, chili powder, and cumin covered in verde salsa. Delicious! Chicken thighs are done around 20-25 min at 375. Usually serve with rice and steamed green veggie.

Delicious and very easy to make. I didn’t have boneless chicken thighs so I used chicken breasts and baked it a few extra minutes.  I served the Salsa Chicken with Mexican style rice. It’s a keeper!

Super easy. I suppose also super logical, but I hadn't though to do it. This was restaurant quality. I made the salsa with items out of my garden, so I'm not sure how it would work with store-bought.

My family loved this chicken. I used fajita seasoning instead of taco seasoning. Cooked perfectly with instructions. It was so easy. This will definitely be a regular item on our weekly menus.

So easy and delicious! I added more taco and chili seasonings to the chicken, and used a fresh salsa and 1 chopped jalapeño. Served with fresh corn and Mexican rice. Wonderful!

I have made it several times and shared with many.  This is a newer version with all the same ingredients.  Not the best of pictures and I would not have looked at it twice it the original showed it with rice since Phil would not eat rice but Spanish Rice would be nice on the side.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. I made a cilantro Lime rice dish on the side with some corn salsa and chips. Very good. :-)

i like and enjoy making casseroles. This is probably my favorite Mexican type casserole.  Followed recipe except less chili powder and I bought a Costco Chicken and pulled off breast meat. I've made this 3 or 4 times and everyone likes it.

Just tried this using all of RainbowEyes recommended changes and loved it.  The only thing we didn't add was the extra chopped chiles on top of the cheese.  We had a jar of pineapple habanero salsa and used that.  It was excellent.

Yum!  So easy! I used a red salsa and cheddar because that’s what I had.  If my son weren’t so picky, I would try Pepperjack and green salsa and/or green chilies.

I did not have Taco seasoning so I used Fajita seasoning. I also cooked it in a slow cooker. That way my chicken breasts were nice and tender and pulled apart easily. Very delicious recipe. I added extra salsa on top of my chicken. Doing so I had more juice/liquid to saturate my rice with.  Also, Extra cheese! yummy!

Could only give this 3 stars because I made changes.  I used thighs instead of breasts;....won't use chicken breasts in anything unless I've brined them first and was out of brined chicken breasts, plus I like thighs better anyway.  Otherwise followed the assembly as written I did add canned chopped chili peppers that I sprinkled over the salsa.  After baking the chicken dish for 45 minutes, I removed the foil and sprinkled a generous amount of shredded Monterey Jack cheese, instead of cheddar, over the top and heated until melted. I've made my version of this dish several times before and it's delicious.

This was great.  Based on other reviewer feedback I put the taco seasoning in a ziploc bag and shook the chicken.  I added some lightly fried onions and red peppers under the cheese for a bit of crunch in the last 5 minutes of cooking.   Great recipe.  Thanks!

This is fantastic and I wish I knew about this recipe sooner. Super easy and they tasted fantastic with my home canned salsa. Can’t wait to make it again soon! We had with cindys yellow rice and it paired perfectly.

Super simple recipe with a great end result!  Great to serve with mexican/spanish rice, beans, and a salad.  It's great as written, but to kick it up a notch, I add crushed tortillas chips, a squeeze of lime, and cilantro over top when adding the cheese to melt the last few minutes.  Gives it a little something extra to the dish.  Thank you for this super easy, but satisfying chicken dish!

The taco seasoning made it a bit spicier  than I'm accustomed to, but this recipe is *definately* delicious.  Next time, I'll try toning down the taco seasoning spiciness by combining it 50/50 with something else (flour?  maybe some corn meal?) so that there's not so much seasoning.  Overall, a real *winner* that we'll definitely make again so thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great!  So fast and easy to make.  The only thing I changed was I cooked mine in my Crock pot on high for 3 to 4 hours.  And sprinkled cheese on top after plating the food.  With the heat from the chicken  the cheese melted no problem on the chicken.  Served it with Spanish rice, fresh garden salad, and cornbread.

Yummy! I made this recipe almost exactly as stated. The only thing I did differently was take another reviewer's advice and put the taco seasoning in a freezer bag and dredged the chicken that way. It was more evenly coated. 
I used mild taco seasoning and salsa.
This recipe was deeee-lish! Not only will I make it again and again, I have already passed it to family and friends. So easy and so gooood. :) Thanks!

What a pleasant surprise this was. I had misgivings at first because the recipe is so simple, but the flavor was wonderful. I browned the chicken on the stovetop first before baking it.   Serviced it with Mexican rice and corn. I’ll definitely put this in my meal rotation.

I made this recipe using other people's tips of putting the seasoning mix in a bag and shaking it over the chicken breasts.  I put a little homemade salsa in the bottom of the baking dish, added the chicken, poured the rest of the pint jar of salsa over the chicken and baked for 45 minutes (chicken breasts were pretty big).  Took it out of the oven and put Mexican melting cheese and cheddar on it, covered with foil and allowed to sit for 10 minutes.  Delicious!  Will make again.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe.

What a wonderful, quick recipe. I made this in the slow cooker (5 1/2 hours on low) and it came out great. It looked and smelled so good, I forgot the add the cheese! I like that you can adjust the spiciest of this dish by the type of salsa you use. I used medium salsa and it had the perfect kick for my family. I will make this again, possibly in the oven as directed, although it turned out great in the slow cooker, so maybe not!

Holy poop chute batman, this recipe is delicious.  honestly didn't think the taco seasoning on chicken would work (I've only ever used it on beef).

I made this following the recipe exactly. My entire family raved about it. That is a big deal because I thought it's impossible to get my entire family to all like the same meal. This is a first.

Delicious and the recipe is very versatile. I use my own homemade taco seasoning and salsa. Easy to add whatever you like without explaining it here. Thank you for such an inspiring recipe!

This was super-easy and delicious, and perfect for a "use what you've got" meal. I used only 2 breasts and a whole jar of salsa, and sprinkled "Mexican spice blend" on the meat. The chicken was moist, tender, and full of flavor. Rice on the side and dinner was done!

This is so simple and so yummy! The only thing I do differently is use the taco seasoning as a rub on both sides instead of just sprinkling it on, it really helps add more flavor.

This was a fantastic way to make an EASY but delicious dish.  We had some home-made salsa , but I have also made this dish with Rotel (diced  tomatoes & green chile).  I lined the baking dish with some of the tomatoes or salsa and was able to skip greasing the baking dish. Since I  don't like all the additives in store bought package,  I used home made Taco Seasoning 1 from this site.  Husband gave 5 stars too.

I made the crockpot version, just the salsa and chicken and added thinly sliced onion and bell pepper. I ate for 4 nights evening after sharing a healthy portion with a friend. I put shredded cheddar on it when I microwaved it, added Spanish rice and mexicorn and this was filling, delicious and packed with protein. Tasty, simple, great recipe for a bachelor like myself.

This is a great throw-together for a large group. Use good quality chicken breasts and halve them . Add can corn, black beans for interest.

An extremely easy, quick, and delicious meal that can be done on a weeknight. It was very flavorful but a little spicy. I put the taco spice in a bag and added the chicken as others suggested.  That may be why it was too spicy for my 8 year old.

It was surprisingly good. I read some of the reviews before I made it. I used my homemade taco seasoning on the chicken. Since I had chicken thighs that is what I used. I did what a reviewer suggestion removing the chicken from the oven once the cheese melted. I covered it and served it about 15 minutes later. I was surprised on tender, juicy and flavorful the chicken was. I served it with rice. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I use at least a half packet of taco seasoning and I put the cheese on at the beginning so it bakes on top the whole time. I also slice the chicken breasts into 2 pieces so they aren't so thick. The dish is done when the cheese doesn't look smooth anymore and it starts to look more baked on to each chicken piece.  This takes at least 40 minutes or so.

I made this as written, and it was delicious. The next time I used adobo seasoning and roasted salsa verde instead of taco seasoning and regular salsa. It was even better!

This was one of my very first meals that I cooked when I moved out of my parents house in 2011. Here it is 2017 and it still is one of my wife's favorite meals that I make.  It is simple and easy.  A buddy had made fun of me because you it sounds funny but he actually enjoyed it. No need to modify anything and the salsa keeps it moist.

Such an awesome recipe! Our new favorite chicken dish. Used all the ingredients listed only made a couple of changes to how it's prepared. I put on the taco seasoning then lightly browned in a frying pan. I sliced some onions and sautéed them also. Added onions on top then my salsa baked as recommended then added cheese until done. Served with Spanish rice, sliced avocado. On top of chicken I put some sour cream and cilantro! Making again soon!

It was tasty! My family enjoyed it, even the very picky two-year old. I  did top it with sour cream but that just made it better.  Definitely adding this to the dinner rotation.

This is a good simple chicken dish. Perfect for that night you don't really feel like cooking, but know you need to make a meal. Paired this with some roasted potato wedges and a lemon and garlic salad.

Fantastic and super easy. I was able to prepare the sides while the chicken cooked. I used a garlic salsa and I'm glad I did. I think that definitely could make or break this dish. I also used chicken tenders and cooked it a little less. I'll will make this dish over and over again.

Delicious! Just followed the recipe! Made Spanish rice and a pea salad that gave the dish that little added coolness. My husband really enjoyed it! Said, I could make this again! JB

Delicious! Might use a reviewer's suggestion to drain the salsa next time, since there was so much sauce left on the bottom of the pan.  Will make again!

I had to use chili seasoning b/c I didn't have any taco seasoning so it made it a bit spicier and a tad different taste but overall it's good.

Good base recipe with room to adjust to taste - I used Mrs. Dash Hot instead of taco seasoning, sauteed the chicken in a little olive oil in my cast iron pan, then put it in the oven for 25 minutes.  Came out moist and tender although mild in flavor even though I added some jalapeno slices to the salsa.  Still I will make it again and continue tinkering with it to our taste.

Unlike others, I had not heard of this recipe before so I appreciated it being included again. My husband and I really enjoyed the flavors. The only change I made was to add Cotija (Mexican cheese) and less cheddar so that I could cut down on the fat content of the dish. Husband's Drs. orders, you know! Great recipe. I will be making it again. Thanks.

Ive never used the sour cream, it just adds extra calories and it realy doesn't need it. I use a blend of cheddar and monterey jack cheese or sometimes just mozzarella. Its really a good          dish and originaly was a Weight Watcher's Recipe I believe.

I prefer doing this in a slow cooker and shredding the chicken afterwards. When I do it in the oven like this, I like to quick fry the chicken, to get a bit of caramelisation on the outside, then put in the casserole dish and cover with salsa.

This was GREAT!  I baked it for 25 minutes then added the cheese and then another 5 minutes.  It was the most tender, moist chicken breast.  My husband and I were really surprised.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Delicious. Recipe turns out perfect as is. But of course I utilized the fabulous reviews and added green peppers
and sliced black olives. Adding the taco seasoning into a plastic baggie  and coating the breasts  was the best way to do this.

It was rather disappointing. Kind of bland. Chicken was juicy but I would not make it again.

While there is nothing gourmet about this recipe, it's beauty is in its simplicity. Minimal ingredients required for a tasty dish. It's not so pretty and not fancy, but a good, basic and easy recipe.

I cooked it as directed and the chicken was still raw in the center.  Cooked an additional 20 minutes.  Not nearly as good as I had hoped.

Very easy and tasty.  Used chicken cutlets (always have them in the freezer) and just spinkled the taco seasoning on it.  Put the liquid from Ro*tel on the bottom of the dish (no oil) and pour the rest of the can on top.  Will make this again

This was really good! I actually put the chicken and the taco seasoning in a large bag and did a quick "shake-n-bake" thing to cover the chicken breasts.   I cooked  this in the  crock pot and it was so nice to come home and have dinner almost done!  All I did was shred the chicken and left it in the crock pot for about an hour  (while I settled in and got the side dishes going) to marinade in the sauce.  We had it on tortillas and it was delicious!

I put too much of the taco seasoning on this dish and it tasted more like a taco.  I would really very lightly dust the chicken with the seasoning.  I will try this with pasta sauce and the white Italian cheese.

Next time I will salt the chicken breasts prior to baking and use more taco seasoning. I thought I sprinkled liberally, but after baking it didn't seem so. Otherwise, yummy and easy!

The only thing I did different was added some shredded mozzarella cheese with the cheddar. It turned out great tender and juicy my husband loves it! We will definitely make this again.

I don't know what was better, how easy it is to make, or how good it tasted.  I used a chunky salsa.  I think a smooth salsa would not be quite as good.  I garnished with some festive ribbon tortilla chips.

Simple and tasty.  

I followed Jill C's advice with can on diced tomatoes with green chili.  They have a nice little bite to it but not enough to overpower.  

I'm never a fan of packaged taco seasoning.  I put some garlic powder, cumin,. paprika and chili into a sealed bag and tossed the chicken.  Also add some standard seasoning - salt/pepper.  

Very light spray of nonstick oil, and then the juice from the diced tomatoes.  Added the chicken then topped with the rest of the canned tomatoes.  

I happened to have some leftover fresh corn and white onions.  I piled all that onto the dish as well.  The sweet corn helped cut down the spiciness for my wife.  

Baked as directed, then add the cheese and finish baking, then let sit covered with foil for 10min.  We topped with sou cream and chopped lettuce and it was delicious. 

I'll probably look to serve with some nacho chips next time to scoop up all the extra drippings.  Chopping the chicken up into bite size pieces would probably make a really good dip.

Delicious and easy! I did make quite a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used 6 bone-in skin on chicken thighs and cooked covered on the stovetop in a heavy bottom pan with a lid for about 30 minutes on med-low as it's warm here and I didn't want to turn on the oven. I also mixed in about 1/4 cup of chicken broth to thin out the sauce. I mixed my own taco seasoning (1/2 tsp oregano, 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder) and used about half of that on the chicken. In addition to the cheese and sour cream, I sprinkled some chopped cilantro on top to finish. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'd brown the chicken 4-5 mins a side first, and reduce cook time to 30 mins and leave out the taco seasoning (whatever THAT is) I almost always have some fresh salsa cruda around, if not Herrera Salsa Cassera. Squirt of lime wouldn't hurt either  (live in Mexico, can't you tell?)
Not a bad recipe for when you're in a hurry though

I made this recipe using the Home made taco seasoning that has low salt, on Allrecipes and I used mild Chunky Picante instead of salsa and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!  

I tried it with the sour cream but found the flavor was So Wonderful that the sour cream only muted the flavor.

My particular 11-year old son asked me to specifically review this recipe.  He loved it and as he has more than once asked me, "Can you please never make this again?" (on recipes rated highly on this site), I thought it would be helpful to know that it passes with high marks!

I followed the instructions but it was a lackluster meal. I made this recipe exactly as stated for my family (I omitted the cheese and sour cream for myself as I'm dairy free). Everyone ate it but nobody was thrilled. It tastes like chicken baked with salsa.

I didn't do this EXACTLY, but read the reviews first and made some adjustments. I was making this for my husband and I and our 3-year-old.  So, I actually took a packet of fajita seasoning, because it tends to be milder, and put it in a ziploc and shook the chicken breasts in the bag until coated.  I preheated the oven to 400 degrees.  Then, I put the chicken breasts on a foil-lined baking dish with vegetable oil spray coating.  Then I spooned the liquid from a can of diced tomatoes with chilies into the ziploc bag with the remaining fajita seasoning and shook that up, cut off a corner of the bag, and squirted the juice onto the chicken breasts for extra marinade. I put the pan into the oven for 20 minutes.  Then, I spooned the diced tomatoes with chilies with a sprinkle of hot sauce on to our two breasts, and just put fresh cut cherry tomatoes on my sons.  Returned them to the oven for 10 more minutes.  When that was up, I sprinkled shredded mild cheddar onto all the breasts and returned to the oven for 3 more minutes until the cheese melted.  It was so juicy, perfectly cooked, and tasty.  Love this recipe!

I have been making this dish for 2 years now and I absolutely love it. I however made a few changes myself to my own personal liking.

Changed I made:
1- I remove the cheese as I am trying to cut some dairy out.
2- I chop up some jalapenos and add these to the already chunky salsa.
3- I chop into strips and pieces some red and yellow bell peppers and toss them into the already chunky hot salsa.

That's it, no cheese and some extra peppers!

Absolute perfection.

This was truly easy and delicious!!!  We ate the chicken in flour tortillas with sour cream.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been guacamole. 
I followed the recipe to the letter. I did cut my breasts in half to make them thinner. I was afraid it wouldn't be good, but it was sooooo tender and flavorful.

Yes, it's good and worth making. So easy too! It uses ingredients that are always around the house and if you don't have taco seasoning on hand you can just stir up a recipe of the homemade stuff! Also if you are using thick chicken breasts, cut them in half so they are thinner. More flavorful this way.

Excellent and Easy.  Great for large families.  I just made the portions larger and cooked slightly longer.  It is a dish we make almost once a week!  I also sautéed some fresh fajita vegetables that come pre-cut from the fruit and veggie department.  Wonderful dish!

Loved this recipe. Very easy to make. I had some cut up chicken pieces that I shook up in a bag with McCormick Taco seasoning and sprinkled pepper on top. Since I'm from San Antonio I had a whole jar of Riverwalk Cantina Salsa that I bought at Walmart. I didn't have to use any oil or grease I just put some salsa on the bottom with half a cup of water then poured the rest of the salsa on top covered with foil baked at 400 for 60 min then poured shredded cheese on top with oven off. My kids loved it! Will make again.

This was really good. I made some changes though. First of all I ran out of salsa. I only had about 1/2 cup of salsa, so I mixed that with salsa verde and some green chili hot sauce. Next, I cut some lime and red bell peppers and put those on top of the chicken and salsa. I then covered the pan with tin foil. Everything came out perfect! I gave my guests the choice to put it over Spanish rice or a salad. Everyone loved it.

I just made this recipe using Jill C's review instructions. I used the Rotel instead of the salsa and dredged the chicken using a Ziplock bag with the taco seasonings. I used the liquid from the Rotel can instead of greasing the Pyrex. Cooked for 30  minutes at 375f oven. My husband LOVED it!

I don't always use taco seasoning (or I try to use a homemade taco seasoning if I have some made up) and it's still a quick and tasty meal, and fairly healthy depending on the salsa you use.  This is also great for chicken tacos, very versatile.

Made 10 chicken breasts with 2 taco packets & 2 cups of salsa. Removed 1/2 just before it was fully cooked and refrigerated it for another night's dinner. Delicious and easy for a working mom!

It tasted better the second day once flavors had the chance to blend.  I imagine the salsa you use makes a big difference.  I used tostitoes mild and will probably try a different one if I make it again.  overall it tasted like chicken with salsa dumped on it.

Made this using Newman's Own Corn & Black Bean Salsa, McCormicks Chicken Taco seasoning. Covered with Walmarts Fiesta cheese blend.  Served with Rice Roni's Spanish Rice. My wife is reluctant to try new things. She a good 'ole southern girl that cooks with 2 standard spices . . . salt & more salt.  Anyway she went back for seconds.

Lots of water in the pan after cooking. I would do more to drain the salsa/tomatoes/Ro-tel next time. Served with queso rice, broccoli, sour cream, and taco chips. No left-overs!

I love this chicken recipe!! it is so easy and a real family favorite! I basically follow the recipe as written with some minor changes.
I find that most chicken breast are huge so I split them in have longways and sometimes pound them so they are all an even thickness.
I make my own taco seasoning from this site 
Taco Seasoning 1
I rub both sides with the seasoning and let them sit for a bout 15 minutes.  I top the chicken with fresh pico de gallo, I like the fresh taste of it, and it doesn't matter to me if it cooks a little.  
I serve this with Mexican Tomato rice ( from this site as well), roasted peppers and guacamole.  A great dinner.
Thank you for the very flavorful recipe!!

I loved this recipe. The chicken is tender, juicy, and flavorful. I would recommend less taco seasoning if you don't like spice. Also, chicken breast halves aren't necessary. I just used 4 regular breasts.

As for the process and cleanup, the recipe is super easy to make and clean. I am not an experienced chef (as in I'd never handled raw chicken), and after figuring out the size of the breast, it was super easy. Plus, you only really need to clean the pan.

I loved this chicken recipe, and I don't usually like chicken. Thumbs up for this family favorite!

I followed this recipe to the letter and I did not care for it.  I really wanted to like it because it's very easy to make but I didn't like it.   The taco powder is too overpowering, and to be honest I don't care for store bought salsa.  Maybe I'm to spoiled on my mom's authentic Mexican salsa she makes from scratch but no one in my family liked it.  Sorry.

This was excellent!  The chicken was moist and really tasty.  I didn't put the cheese on the chicken.  I served with cauliflower and put the cheese on that.  The sour cream was an excellent touch.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

As written, it is just ok.  To make it a 4-star I cook up some Spanish rice and cook up 2 diced zucchinis.  When the chicken is done I slice it up then put a bed of rice on the bottom of the casserole (13 X 9) and then the cooked zucchini.  I sprinkle on cheese then layer the chicken on top with more sprinklings of cheese.  Next I sprinkle on some chopped fresh cilantro and put the dish in the oven to melt the cheese.  Just before serving I sprinkle on some finely diced red onion.  Green onion would be great on top, too.  Love it with the suggested sour cream. Make sure to line the pan with foil as the chicken/taco seasoning burns.  Thank you for the inspiration!

This is an excellent and easy recipe! I read the reviews and decided to try the changes suggested by Rainbow Eyes the second time I made it. I am glad I did because it made the chicken very flavourful. I also a 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro that I had on hand and needed to use up. The recipe is a keeper, one that I will add to the rotation. Thank you!

Added some Ortega hard taco shells with ground beef and all the works and some soft shells for the chicken salsa to be wrapped in. I also heavily coated the chicken in Old El Paso seasoning on the stove top in olive oil flipping the chicken until it was no longer pink.  Then I placed it in the oven taking it in and out  to add other ingredients such as the Tostitos salsa, cheese, then finally wrapping it in the soft shell and putting it back in to slightly harden the shell.

A hit with the entire family.  Instead of salsa (which I'm sure is EASY and GREAT) I used Jill Canfield's suggestion of diced tomatoes with chilies.   I added the dash of Chipotle tabasco, which created some hot spots, so next time I would mix into the tomatoes and stir, before placing tomatoes on top, just to even it out a bit.  I made the Spanish Rice II by John Mac located on this site.  I used minute rice and used 2 cups instead, then of course you need 2 cups liquid.  I made my own chicken broth with bullion cubes to add more flavor (vs just water).  VERY VERY GOOD!  Will try again using Salsa like original recipe calls for, just to see which I prefer.

I didn't think it could turn out very good but it actually did. I was really short on time and threw the chicken in the oven after seasoning it with the taco seasoning and then covering it with Pace salsa (mild because - kids). Then baked it for about 45 minutes because my breasts weren't 100% thawed. Temped them to 165F and then added the cheese. I used a pre-shredded blend I had on hand and let it bake for about another five minutes. 
Served with some Mexican rice I made, corn, and tortilla chips. Added sour cream to the chicken and it was a super easy dinner I'll make again. 
My daughter gave it two thumbs up.

As written, the recipe was very good. The kind of salsa you use really matters, as a lot of them become bland when cooked. It's also very good with a can of rotel tomatoes instead of salsa, if you like it very hot!

This is my go to recipe now! Super easy and really yummy! I used mango salsa and it gave the dish a good amount of sweetness the complimented the chicken very well.  I also tired the recipe with a green salsa and didn't care for it too much. Definitely prefer red over green. Going in my cookbooks for sure!

So easy and so tasty. I used the leftovers to make burritos - chopped it up and wrapped it in tortillas with some refried beans, then poured a little more salsa and cheese on top. A side of guac - yum! Two easy and delicious meals.

Easy to make. Used chicken tenders .  I usually have to ask my husband how the food is but before I asked, he said, "This is excellent!"

Fantastic!! So simple and quick. Made it with brown rice and the salsa pan drippings on the rice. Also steamed carrots with a bit of honey. To put a contrasting sweet flavour on the plate.

Quick and easy. I pounded/flattened the chicken breast slightly, just to be a little more uniform in cooking time. Next time I will only cook for 25 minutes and then add the cheese for just a couple more minutes so they are a little moister.

I used MrsHappyHomemakers  changes (for the most part) except I put provolone cheese and jalapenos. I put a layer of medium salsa on the bottom of the cookware, placed the chicken, dumped the rest of the salsa on the chicken, then added the cheese and jalapenos. In the future I might try adding beans and corn to the mix as well.

This was a great recipe. I had homemade salsa and I used that. It had more onion than store bought salsa but I think that just added more flavor. I also used a recipe for the seasoning from allrecipes. It smelled so good while cooking! The chicken was very tender.

Made this for my family and I got more than I expected when I cooked it in the oven! It took 55 minutes in total to prepare with frozen chicken breasts (they had to dethaw in microwave). I didn't have any taco seasoning, but I made my own, which turned out great! I used oregano, black pepper, chili powder, bayou Cajun powder, and kosher salt. It turned out delicious and my whole family enjoyed it!

I followed directions with what I had on hand and it was a great dinner. Needed a quick way to use left over rotisserie chicken, slides, wings, legs Etc. Greased bottom of pan, added the cooked chicken pieces, sprinkled both sides w taco seasoning, poured a habanero chunky salsa on top, shredded cheese and warm for 15 min in the oven on 375. It was still juicy. 

As a side,  I microwaved uncle bens chicken rice and mixed with corn. Served with sour cream. This was super easy and delicious for a quick dinner.

I made this as specified, except I used a homemade taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I on here) and first oiled the chicken breasts and then rubbed the seasoning on them.  Since my husband and little man are not huge fans of "spicy" food (I know, its a sin) I ended up one day putting some salt, pepper and olive oil on the chicken, pouring pasta sauce (whichever I have on hand) on top, and later melting an Italian shredded cheese mix on top.  Its basically the same recipe, but "Italian"(and not "spicy")! Either version takes pretty much 0 prep, and always comes out juicy and flavorful.  It is a hit in our house especially when making supper after work can't be a big production! I always bake it in a glass dish, covered with the glass top.

I made this for company the other night and it was considered a "keeper".  It was very moist and tender and best of all so simple.  I rubbed the chicken on both sides with the seasoning and put it in my baking  pan in the refrigerator for a few hours before baking it.  Served it with Mexican rice and a tossed salad.

This was very easy to make and all ingredients I had on hand. Had very good flavor and will be making this again. Next time I will use smaller chicken breast and maybe flatten to have more surface area covered with sauce.

I really liked this recipe! I didn't make any changes..Actually, the only change I made was accidentally putting more taco seasoning on it.  But it still came out great! And it was so easy to make! I used Texas Texas salsa.  I added a side of spanish rice and a side refried blackbeans with jalapeno for this and it came out great.

I have to admit I am not a fan of baked chicken, so I was nervous about how this recipe would turn out.  After making and tasting it I can honestly say I am very impressed.  The only real issue was that the salsa I used was a bit too hot for my little one, but otherwise rave reviews from the whole family. I didn't even make any changes to the recipe.

Very easy recipe to make! I used McCormick Perfect Pinch Mexican Seasoning instead of taco seasoning,it's  a sub I often make. I also used sliced cheese instead of shredded. I just think it melts better... my family loves this easy recipe.

Although I have made this exactly as listed, and it was very easy and good,  I did take the advice of other reviews and my family prefers the new results better.  Since it was quite a departure from this recipe, my family decided to give its own name.  It is listed as Tortilla Chicken.

This was easy to make and the family enjoyed.  It was quick to assemble and not a lot of mess to clean up. Next time I would use a different cheese  maybe Monterey Jack .    This was good but not off the charts.

A very simple, but tasty recipe. The chicken came out so tender and flavorful. It is my favorite quick meal.

Made this and decided to kick it up a notch. Stuffed it with the cream cheese mixture from a baked jalapeno popper recipe I found on All Recipe and added some fresh, diced jalapeno. Definitely gave it the zing it needed.

Wow. I have to say this was amazing. So quick and so delicious! I didn't make any real changes that would have made a big difference. I rubbed the taco seasoning in the chicken both sides, and placed it in the oven at 350 for an hour. I added some Mexicorn into the pan to cook with it and at the end smothered the chicken in Mexican cheese and cooked it for another few minutes til the cheese was melted. So yummy! Definitely will make again! Oh I used Pace Mild Chunky salsa if anyone was  wondering.

We love this in our house and make it at least once per month.  I follow the recipe as is but also add thin tortilla strips when sprinkling the cheese on at the end.  This gives it a bit of crunch.  Kids love it.

Love the recipes that are so easily adjusted to suit your "heat" level and preferences.   I used thin Chicken cutlets,  mild Taco seasoning and Green Mountain Gringo Mild salsa and Monteray Jack Cheese.  Grandpa and grand-kids approved.  Kinda looked like pizza and took no time to cook.  Roasted some baby potatoes and served with broccoli.  "kid food" nothing,  can't wait to make it again for us old folks

I really enjoyed how easy this meal was. I just put the chicken on a cookie sheet, coated both sides with taco seasoning, and use a mild mango flavored salsa to cover the chicken. Baked it for 30 minutes and then added the cheese and baked for 5 more minutes and added sour cream to the top. It looked really nice when it came out too!

Absolutely delicious!  And so easy!  Substituted store bought taco seasoning for homemade (an All Recipes recipe!)  My husband doesn't like "taco" anything so I didn't tell him it was considered taco seasoning until after he fell In love the taste.  This will become a staple in our household!

Followed the recipe exactly, but made it in the crock pot.  Simplicity itself and so delicious!  There are only two of us so I have plenty of left overs to shred to use in burritos.  I served it with homemade quacomole  and sour cream and tortillas.   Hubby loved it and is looking forward to the leftovers.  As an added note, pick your favorite salsa to use in this recipe.  The salsa is what gives it the flavor so you don't want to use just any old salsa.  I'm going to try it with green salsa next time and  maybe even throw in some diced green chilies.  Great starter recipe.

Made this in May 2016 for the first time and it was very good, quick and simple. I have nothing but boys and I have to say it's really inexpensive, filling and my boys loved it. My husband loved it too. It does indeed taste like chicken enchiladas without the corn tortilla. Thank you for posting this dish and sharing.

This recipe is so simple and so good!  I make it exactly as written, and it's perfect every time.  I usually serve it with rice (throw some Mexican spices in the water and cook as directed) and a green veggie or salad.  Although I love sour cream, I've never served it with this... it doesn't need it.

This recipe is great and so easy.   I made this as submitted except I pounded the chicken to make it  tender and cook faster... and used 4 TBSP of taco seasoning,  Baked at 350 for 35 min.  and turned the over off  and topped  with cheese and just let it sit in the  oven until the cheese melted (2 min.)  Served with sour cream and mexican rice.   Thank you..

I made this last night, and it was very tasty.  I might want to try marinating it overnight next time, as the seasoning was all on the surface.  Also, I think the chicken breasts I used were too thick.  I might try pounding them so they are thinner, too.  It was definitely good enough to try again!

Made this exactly as the recipe stated and we loved it.  I had made enough for left overs but we ended up finishing it all off.  Very easy, especially considering the great taste.  I will definitely make It again and it will probably become a regular dish of ours.

Sooooooo good! Very easy, too! I put my chicken breasts in a gallon ziplock and added fajita seasoning (that's all I had!) and let it sit for about 3 hrs, added diced jalepenos on top and then baked according to the directions. When I took it out of the oven, I topped it with chopped green onions. It couldn't have been any easier!

This Salsa Chicken recipe is delicious. I followed the recipe with the exception of the cheese. I used four cheese Mexican blend and this came out perfect. I will be making this again soon.

This is my husbands new favorite. The only change I made was to coat the chicken in taco seasoning instead of sprinkling it on according to one of the reviews I read.

I love this recipe. I actually use a combo of mayo and light sour cream to dredge the chicken in before breading with panko crumbs mixed with taco seasoning mix.  So delish and my family loves it.

Needed something easy after a long day working in the garden. I made  this with two boneless chicken breast and used about the same amount of seasoning and salsa. Maybe a bite more of the salsa since we love salsa. This was great! Especially since we were very tired and hungry and it was so easy! Thanks All receipes!

Amazing!   A hit with the whole fam, even my picky 9-year-old.  Tonight I didn't have the taco seasoning, so I used McCormick Beef Stew Seasoning instead and just sprinkled it lightly on each side of the chicken, then used the salsa and cheese like the recipe calls for.  We had it with herb and butter small potatoes and whole kernel corn.  It was perfect and we will definitely be having this again!

Depends on how fresh the salsa but good overall. I also add Italiano seasoning sometimes / parmesan cheese.

I followed another readers review and toss the chicken in a ziploc bag with a packet of taco seasoning. Then I pour a little salsa in the bottom of the casserole, add the coated chicken breasts, then pour over the rest of the salsa. I cook it for about 25 minutes. Then I remove it, and add some cheese (pepper jack is good, but any kind would be delicious), and cook for another 5 minutes. It is sooooo good!

I used a hot pepper oil to grease the pan and a fairly chunky salsa. This was tasty, and I think the addition of sour cream seals the deal. If I had a little more time, I would have pounded the chicken breasts out a bit. I served with beans and rice, and overall it was pretty good. I can see this becoming a regular on the menu on "lazy" cooking days.

Oh my!  This will absolutely be in my monthly rotation!  I used boneless chicken thighs (our preference), but it would be excellent with chicken breasts, too.  I Served this with Mexican Rice and Sweet Cornbread.  Yummy!

I made this a month ago for my husband and he loved it!  I did as suggested by another reviewer and put the taco seasoning (along with some additional cayenne pepper and chili powder) in a ziploc and gave it a good shake.  Then I added some salsa to the bottom of the baking dish before putting in the chicken.  I topped with a good dollop of sour cream and with some Spanish rice and refried beans this makes the perfect week night supper!

This was really good & really easy!  I used a package of taco seasoning mix, sprinkled it on top, then added some salsa (the rest of the jar: not sure of the amount), baked 50 min, then added cheese on top, baked until cheese was melted.  I did not use sour cream, as I didn't have any on hand.
I usually just cook chicken breasts on the stove top, then add salsa & simmer for like 45 minutes.  This is quicker, less time in the kitchen, and tastier.  Will definitely make again.
UPDATE: I made this as is, using the AR  Taco Seasoning I Recipe, and it was delicious!  My husband said the sour cream was a nice addition :)

I made this recipe because I had a lack of ingredients. After following the recipe exactly, it came out good and juicy, but I didn't love the flavor because of the taco seasoning I had. Next time I'll use real tomatoes and chilies instead. This makes a really good chicken burrito with black beans and sour cream!

Made a written using a homemade taco seasoning from this site, "famous taco seasoning". 
It was an awesome change from the regular chicken breasts Dinners I've been making. The flavor of this dish will definitely depend on the quality of your salsa and taco seasoning. I can't wait to have my leftovers cold on top of salad or in a wrap tomorrow. Not sure why it took me so long to make this, but I'm glad I finally did.

Turned out great! Omitted the cheese and served it with Black bean salad. I drizzled Frank's Buffalo sauce on top. I also let the chicken rest, covered, for 5 mins to let the juices seal.

Just too bland.  Haven't seen anyone offer suggestions on how to liven it up.  Probably avoiding this one in the future.

I skipped the taco seasoning and just made a little chili powder, cumin and cayenne pepper to add on. Perfect easy dish. Will be making all the time.

I had other plans for my chicken I thawed out but was missing a critical ingredient. I saw this and gave it a shot. I am shocked at how good this was. Few ingredients and hardly no prep. I already want it again.

Very easy and fast to prepare.  Taste was good -- not amazing.  The sour cream is a must.  My family enjoyed it with tortilla chips.  Reasonably healthy if you cut back on the cheese and serve with light sour cream or Greek yogurt.

I loved this recipe for it's absolute simplicity very very easy to make. I tweeked just a bit . . . only did 2 chicken breasts . . . 1/2 tsp taco seasoning per side (keeping the 1 tsp per chicken breast format) . . . then . . . I used a full cup of fresh salsa (this is the tweek - recipe calls for 1 cup of salsa for 4 chicken breasts) The full cup kept the chicken very moist during cooking. I used a full cup because fresh salsa does not have all that juice that jarred salsa has and I did not want it to dry out . . . also,  I had the fresh on hand and wanted to use it up as it usually goes bad before we can use it all! I could have covered  the pan as the tip below suggests . . .but I kinda liked the idea of the salsa getting a little 'baked'. If I had used jarred salsa I would have only used 1/2 cup for the 2 chicken breasts & I am sure it would have been fine. I really liked it but my husband not so much. He doesn't care for food that is even mildly spicy . . . and this was mild . .  used mild fresh salsa.

I love this basic recipe because it's easy to add whatever else you want with it. A can of diced tomatoes, onion, peppers...
I love putting mine in the slow cooker. 
I've even shredded it and made chicken tacos!
5 stars for basic and versatile!

So quick, easy and tasty.  Decided to use  Rotel instead of salsa.  Didn't need sour cream - very cheesy with Mexican Blend cheese.  Served with Mexican Rice, Mexi-corn and salad.

Made it as written. Had as sides rice mixed with crumbled bacon and black beans. It was a winner with my 8 yr old son, who normally likes all his food separate and plain, but did not mind the salsa and cheese on the chicken.

I have made a similar Salsa Chicken.  I cube the chicken and season and brown it.  I then add salsa and cooked rice (white or brown).  No taco seasoning.  It is a one pan meal.

This was OK. It was really easy to prepare  which is always a plus. Unfortunately I found it pretty bland.

In Northern Alberta you can,t bake chicken with bone in for less then 45 minutes.  So  I baked the chicken with the taco seasoning for 30 minutes at 400 F.  Threw on the salsa and baked for another 40 minutes.  The chicken was raw!!!!!

Substituted boneless chicken thighs by accident (turns out that's what I had on hand) and it STILL came out great! I also used 79SHALE97's tip to cover in foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes after cooking. I'll be making this recipe again and again.

My boyfriend absolutely loved it. I am not a fan of spicy and the taco seasoning was spicy, even though it doesn't say "spicy" but if you like spicy then this is for you!

Delicious! Not too bad for my first attempt! Very filling and tasty! Used some tips from 79Shay79 with the "shake and bake" taco seasonal route and using Rotel tomatoes. Took 45 minutes total. Had white rice as a side and sprinkled some lime juice over to add some tang.

I will definitely make this again.  I made it with a can of original Rotel and pineapple salsa(what I had on hand). I added a little cayenne pepper to the taco seasoning.  It was really good and incredibly easy.  The best part is that you don't have to pre- cook the chicken.  I would drain the Rotel next time.

Very good meal and easy enough an inexperienced cook can handle.  I had to make a couple of modifications. I only had a half cup of salsa so I mixed with queso cheese and poured one cup onto chicken. Baked at 400 degree's instead 375 for 35 minutes. My daughter took seconds so that says a lot about how easy and tasty this meal is. I have only been cooking for four weeks.

I made this exactly as written, using Easy Taco Seasoning from this site.  

Pros: simple to prepare, very few ingredients, inexpensive and low-cal, very quick to make
Cons:  It just didn't taste that good.  The chicken wasn't tender, the sauce was too thin and it didn't have much flavor even though  it had the taco seasoning.

I won't make this again.

Easy, great meal to make in the slow cooker.  The house smelled great and our gang could not wait to eat it.   I used a slow cooker liner for easy clean-up.  I pounded the chicken breast flat, mixed a packet of Ortega Taco Seasoning with 2/3 cup of olive oil and brushed on the mixture to both sides, poured some salsa on the bottom of the pan, placed two chicken breasts on the salsa, poured more salsa on top of them,  placed the other two chicken breasts on top of that, poured the remainder of the salsa on them, and cooked them for four hours on high.  After they were done, I placed the breast in a pan, sprinkled on shredded cheese, and placed them in pre-heated oven to melt the cheese.  I served them over Near East Spanish Rice and with Birdseye Southwestern Corn.  Good, easy meal which I have been asked to make again soon.

This is a super easy and quick dinner to put together; sometimes the baking time needs to be adjusted depending on chicken size. I make this dish with a side of Mexican rice and beans, and leftovers make good shredded chicken sandwiches or tacos! You could also use the leftover chicken shredded on a salad with tortilla chips and guac.

This is good as is, but I prefer my version- I use fajita seasoning for a smokier flavor, and pair it with a sweeter salsa (I use On the Border restaurant style salsa, found at Wal-Mart). Family favorite!

I made this recipe as stated with mild chunky salsa. We try to eat healthy through out the week and this was a nice edition to our healthy eating. Will definitely fix again. My husband likes it a bit Spicer so he added jalapeños to his.

I cut the chicken breasts halves into half again and seasoned them liberally  with fajita seasoning a little chili seasoning and black pepper. I spooned on diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers that I had in my cabinet and followed everything else the same, I served it with rice that I made with chicken bouillon...my family loved it and even my picky kids asked for me to make it again. I had everything in my pantry and it was soooo easy and delish!

What a tasty, quick meal which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Happened to have four chicken thighs on hand, as well as the other ingredients, so marinated it overnight, baked for dinner tonight for the two of us which we loved.  So quick and easy, definitely a keeper!  Please continue to publish delicious easy recipes like this one.  Thanks!

With a homemade salsa and sour cream this recipe couldn't be any easier.  It was good with a baked potatoe and corn, but not something I will crave.

I made it in the crock pot for 6 hours. Really didn't change the recipe. I did add a tiny amount of water in n the bottom but other than that my husband and I loved it. I made Spanish rice as a side and it was great. Very easy to make.

I made this and it was really good and simple to make. I changed it up a little to avoid going to the grocery store. First I used chicken tenders and topped it with pepper jack with a little Mexican cheese on top.  This was very good and quick to make.

This recipe was simple and delicious! Due to the warm weather, we opted to cook the chicken on the b.b.q. The chicken breasts were marinated ahead of time in Italian dressing then a mexican rub was put onto the breasts. We had homemade salsa on hand and sour cream. Next time we will add the black beans and chopped green onions and pair the chicken with rice to make it a full meal. This is definitely a staple recipe!

Really easy and pretty good!  I used thighs instead of breasts since that was all I had.

Very easy to make and tasted great! I made it with Old El Paso fajita seasoning and served with Minute Rice (Mexican style)  and it paired together perfectly. I loved this.

Whoever said it was so much better coating the chicken with taco seasoning was WRONG. it's almost inedible this way. Way way too much taco seasoning. Stick with the original recipe and just sprinkle it on. I love highly seasoned food but this was just awful. Sorry I listened to the review that claimed her way was so much better

I have been making this for years and we love it....great flavor and so simple.  I toss the chicken in a bag with the taco seasoning and then place it in pan and top with the salsa.  About 15 minutes before its done I sprinkle over a can each of black beans and corn kernels (both rinsed and drained), and then top with the cheese and bake for about 15 minutes longer.

Cooked chicken smothered in low sodium taco seasoning in a crock pot on low for about 3 hours then I put in 1/2 the salsa and cooked another 2 hours. once done I put the chicken and all sauce in a glass pan. I added sauted green peppers and sweet onions on top of the chicken. then put the layer of cheese that I shredded. I used the Mexican brand cheese "quesadilla".   Lastly I added the other 1/2 of the salsa and put in the oven til cheese melts.

Just made it tonight and we both absolutely loved it.  It was very easy and I made some black beans and rice to go with it.  I used skinless thighs and breast both were tender and juicy. Followed the recipe exactly.  I did cover it for the first 25 minutes just to keep it juicy before adding cheese.  Your friends and family will love this dish and it is very budget friendly.

Been doing this one for years, sans "Taco Seasoning Mix". It's a go-to "Simple" work night dinner. We do 350 for 45min to an hr, but it's the same dish. Also, recommend covering for the long cook, and uncovering for the cheese melt. 
Last observation: Cheddar's a great cheese, but when you have four cheese Mexi-blend on store shelves across the world, well... why cheddar?

This is a good recipe for a quick weekday dinner. I used Tositos mild chunky salsa which had an overwhelming flavor, so I might use fresh salsa next time! :)

Pretty good.  I'll make it again.  The instructions didn't say one way or the other, but I put a lid over the chicken until it was time to add the cheese. Covering the pan produced a nice sauce to go with the rice.   I used Havarti cheese with Jalapenos, and served the chicken with Spanish Rice from this site.

This is a favorite at our house. I thought I had made it up! I often pound the chicken breasts first. I sprinkle with salt and a teaspoon of chilli powder. I brown the chicken breasts and put them  in a glass baking dish. I use a fresh salsa, not the cooked type. Pour the  whole jar over the chicken. I like to pour a mini-carton of quality chicken broth over the top. Finally I sprinkle with cheddar cheese. I bake it cover with foil at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. I usually serve it with saffron rice, fresh corn, and/or fresh pineapple. The chicken comes out tender and yummy!

Super quick and easy! Didn't really follow the measurements but there's really no need; used the taco seasoning more as a rub, then doused in salsa. So easy, so yummy!!!

Excellent and easy.  I did slice an onion and placed it on top which gave it more flavor.  Used the crock pot to make it even easier.

These were wonderful and easy!! I used five skinless bone-in thighs that I had on hand and followed the recipe. I baked them at 385 degrees for about 50 minutes to reach the correct temp (high altitude). The husband loved them! Served with my Mexican rice recipe and corn. Great week day meal...but could be used for guests as well.

Excellent! The only change I made was that I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, as I do in most recipes that call for breasts, because the chicken is so much more tender.

A couple alternatives to this incredibly good recipe.  I put a layer of salsa in a crockpot, add frozen ( how simple is this?)boneless, skinless breasts, then top with remaining salsa.  I leave this for 6-8 hours on low. I also throw in a cubed block of low fat cream cheese, yes there is till extra calories...so it's not everyone's option.  This makes the salsa a more creamy texture to top the breasts with upon serving.  I have also shredded the chicken and placed it on a bed of Spanish rice or a rice and bean blend.  Great recipe and couldn't be easier!

It was pretty good, not the best though. Did exactly as recipe said. Although I did overcook it a little, the flavor didn't really stay with the chicken. Just needs some TLC.

This was absolutely amazing, yet so simple wow! Literally the highlight of dinner. Only thing we might add next time is a hotter salsa or some jalapeños. Maybe some Cajun seasoning? That has become my secret ingredient in many dishes haha.

It was rather bland.Too much going on on the outside of the chicken. Very sloppy.

This was really good everyone liked it!  I make a similar one with BBQ sauce instead of seasoning and salsa which I like but even the kids loved this one!

I tweaked the recipe some. I didn't have enough breast for a family of 5 the first time I made this, so I cubed it instead, then I put chicken in quart size bag and added seasoning to bag and let sit for about 20 minutes. I line my dish with foil, put instant rice in the bottom and put enough water to just cover the rice. Then follow the rest of the recipe. My children ask me on a weekly basis " Mommy when are we having that chicken salsa stuff"  Even My husband asks for it. So glad I found this easy to make recipe.

Made this in the slow cooker and added a drained can of corn and a drained can of black beans for last half hour.  So easy and delicious.  Will be making again for sure.

This is a great meal for a frantic week night!  I cubed the chicken breast and followed the rest of the instructions.  Then created a chicken 'nacho-ish' salad with tortilla chips, rice (didn't have any black beans handy), and lettuce/tomato.

The first time I made this, I felt like it needed something.  The second time was much better; I poured a 15 oz can of drained and rinsed black beans on top of the seasoned chicken and then poured an entire 16 oz jar of salsa on top of it.  FYI, a 1 oz package of taco seasoning mix holds 12 tsp, so this recipe only calls for 1/3 of a package.  Also, in case you buy chicken by the pound and not by the breast like I do, I found that 2 lbs (maybe a bit more) worked well.  Tasty and very simple.

It has potential BUT came out very bland. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I'll have to add a few twists and see if it turns out better.

copied from another review....substituted a can of RoTel..have been making it without the salsa ever since!). I put the entire package of taco seasoning (low sodium variety) in a ziploc bag, and dredge the chicken breasts. Next, I poured some of the liquid off the tomatoes into the bottom of an 8x8 glass baking dish (I did this instead of greasing). I then placed the chicken breasts in the dish, and added a little fresh cracked pepper, and topped them with the tomatoes, and a dash or two of chipotle tobasco sauce. Bake in a 400f oven for 30-35 mins- or if you cook with Science...temp to 140...carryover heat will finish it off) Remove from oven. Sprinkle with cheese and place back in oven for 3 mins or till cheese has melted. (here's where carryover comes into play...) After your cheese is melted, take it out of the oven and remove it from the baking dish. Cover with foil and let it rest for about 10 minutes. This lets all the juices reabsorb. Top with a dab sour cream. I serve this usually with spanish rice, mexican style corn (for this type of corn in a jiff...add some red/black pepper flakes, a little mrs dash,and 2-3 dashes of tobasco sauce..the man will even sometimes top the corn with a dab of shredded cheese), and a salad. Thanks for a great recipe!! Definitely a keeper!

I tried this with my own homemade salsa and it was delicious!!!!! Also I made extra with monterrey jack instead of cheddar it gave it a much more distinguished flavor. This is a very good recipe and I will be making it a lot more often!!

This is a fantastically delicious and easy recipe. I paired it with some Spanish rice and corn bread. Yum! 
I pounded  my breasts to about 3/4 inch thick as this ensures that each bite has its fair share of chicken, salsa and cheese. Oh, and I did use a Monterey cheese blend - which is a must for this recipe if you ask me.

This is my favorite "i have no idea what im going to cook tonight but i need to figure it out fast" recipe.  It's so easy and delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly as written except i use Perdue perfect portions chicken breasts.  This might help the reviews who say the recipe is bland is it cuts down the chicken to topping ratio.

LOVED this!  Even my kids liked it (I have picky kids).  It was very easy to make.  I used the homemade Taco Seasoning (found on AllRecipes.com) and a canned salsa...although homemade will be my next try.  Super easy and super delicious.

I am stingy with my stars, so 4 stars is very good to me.  The only time a recipe is getting 5 stars is if it just  the absolute yummiest thing Ive ever had.  That being said, this was very good chicken.  The salsa adds such yummy flavor, and keeps the chicken moist, and who doesn't like cheese?  I like the addition of sour cream. actually making this again tonight with cous cous and homeade creamed corn off of this site.  yummy :)

btw, my husband said this recipe should have 5 stars.  He talked about it for days.

So simple and so good!!! Along with melting the cheese on top I added a bean and corn mixture around the chicken, this gave the dish color and added another element. I served this along side Mexican rice.

I used black bean and corn salsa, then added a a can of corn (drained) and a can of seasoned black beans, then sprinkled with more of the taco sauce. I followed the rest of the recipe and it was DELICIOUS ! Everyone loved it at my house !

I was blown away with how easy this recipe was to make. I only cooked the chicken 25 minutes and it was essentially ready. Next time, I won't use chunky salsa, though.  The hubby and I approve!

Wow!  So easy.  I'm a very bad cook, but my husband of 21 years said this was the best I ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and I'll give it 5 stars.  I'm making it again right now!  I vary it next time.  Maybe . . .

UPDATE:  I tried it again with a can of tomatoes with chiles and mixed in some salsa and black beans.  Sure is good.

Soooooo easy. Very flavorful, chicken always stays juicy. No need for variation. Great choice for a week night entree.

This was seriously SO good!  And it was the easiest thing to make, perfect for busy weekdays! I followed the instructions, used a package of low sodium taco seasoning and 5 pieces of chicken.  It turned out perfectly.  You can use cottage cheese instead of sour cream to spare some calories, but I doubt it is unhealthy either way.  Serve it with a salad or some rice and beans and it makes a perfect meal!  Thank you for sharing this!

We have 5 kiddos ranging 6-14 years old, and it's difficult to find a recipe that everyone loves.. But this one was a hit across the board! The chicken was flavorful and moist, but not too spicy. My husband and I loved it too! Served it with Spanish rice, and asparagus as a side.

Loved it! I also put the toco seasoning in a bag and seasoned the chicken pieces. Rice, corn on the cob and picketed beets, topped off with a dark brew beer were a nice addition.

It was barely adequate.  I made it with The Best Spanish Rice recipe from this site, which saved the meal because the rice was exceptionally good.  This is not worth making ever again.  I will cut up the left overs and make fajitas with it. Sorry, wished I liked it.

Loved this! Tasted amazing and sooo easy....followed the recipe pretty straight but put the chicken (tenders instead of breasts) in a bag with the spice and shook to cover evenly. Boyfriend loved it. Served with Mexican rice and quesadillas, dinner was a quick hit! 5 stars!

I didn't use the taco seasoning but used a few other seasonings I had in the cupboard.  I used a chunky salsa but think it would have been better with a blended salsa.  My husband, kids and I absolutely loved it.  It was super easy to make.

This is an amazing recipe!  Each time we do this recipe we love it.  Didn't have taco seasoning this time but used Cajun seasoning and it worked just as great.  Didn't use sour cream second time as we didn't have it but it is still just as good :)

This recipe is exactly what I would call "simple genius". If you use your favorite seasoning, salsa and cheese, you will be rewarded with an incredibly simple and delicious dinner. This has become a favorite for busy weeknight dinners!

Very simple and very good. I did use half salsa half Rotel, but kept the recipe the same otherwise. Will make again for sure.

Oh my goodness loved it! Did not have regular salsa on hand, but had "Newman's Own Black Bean & Corn Salsa" - perfect substitute, especially for the taste (& I would think texture- it was creamy)..Even my picky 3 year old loved it!!! - we were shocked!

This would be fine if I liked white meat. But really -- it only tasted good covered with sour cream and guac. I guess I could try boneless thigh next time.

Pretty good dish in and of itself.  The beauty of this dish is how easy and quick it is.  It's the perfect thing to throw together when it's six o'clock and I've got nothing planned and the result is pretty fantastic.  I served this with rice and some mixed vegetables and it made for a wonderful dinner done at a moment's notice.

use low fat sour cream, 2% cheddar cheese, low sodium taco seasoning, Newman's Lime Salsa and use bone in and chicken skin on as there is only a 14 calorie difference and the flavor difference is amazing. One can choose to remove skin if desired. Make sure to not overcook and let chicken rest before serving, on yellow rice and or blacks beans (rinsed). Garnish with fresh cilantro! OLE!

I made this is as and it was very good.  It's easy, simple and tasty.  I didn't measure the taco seasoning or the cheddar cheese, just eye-balled it to my liking and I used taco bell salsa.  I imagine Rotel would do in a pinch...probably would be better.  Thank you for the recipe!

i was pleasantly surprised how good this tasted. it as extremely easy, and the kids said they liked it and would eat it again, but not too frequently.  One said that if we were in the mood for mexican food, this would satisfy the craving.

We had this for the 1st time tonight, so good, thanks! Picky kids ate it up. I used a whole tub of 'fresh' salsa from the store (not a jar); this was the 1st time I cooked w/ that versus the jar & it was way better than my usual "salsa surprise" meal that my husband doesn't exactly rave about. We loved this though & will definitely make again! I made homemade taco seasoning & probably used closer to 6 or 7 teaspoons & added a t. of flour to that, shook it in a bag with the chicken per other reviews. Thanks!

So easy and tasty!!  The spice wimp in the family had a hard time with it until she scraped the sauce off and dredged the chicken in sour cream. Very tasty, I will try it in the slow cooker as others have recommended. Oh, I used Costco Organic Salsa.

I love this I use my homemade salsa and I coat the chicken in the taco seasoning in the morning and just let it sit all day like that. This is one of the few recipes that gets made at least every month in my house. It is so good I always make extra.

I found the chicken to be dry and bland. I didn't taste the taco seasoning at all. I used more than the 4 tsps in the recipe, but now I see others are suggesting the whole package of taco seasoning. Regardless, I probably won't bother trying this one again.

Easy.  Anyone can do it.  Tasty with sour cream (or plain yogurt if you're in a pinch), cheddar, bacon bits, and green onions on top.

Made this for the first time this weekend and absolutely loved it.  I did slightly alter the recipe based on another reviewers advice.  I ground tortilla chips and mixed these with the taco seasoning.  I coated the chicken with this mixture.  The salsa went into the baking dish first then  the coated chicken was placed on top.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was that instead if salsa I used a can of drained Ro-tel tomatoes. I will definitely be making this again!

The biggest downside to this recipe is the packaged taco seasoning, which is pure salt, caramel color?  and all kinds of mystery ingredients.  I would give this all thumbs up if:  use homemade taco seasoning, lots of nice recipes out there;  reduce the cheese; AND use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

My whole family loves this recipe! Super yummy. I use mild taco seasoning and extra mild or mild salsa, just so that it doesn't burn the little one's taste buds.

Wow!  Super Easy!  Great Taste!  Super flexible.  Use less seasoning and mild salsa for those who don't like spicy.  More seasoning and hot salsa for those who do like spicey.  Use small prepackaged breasts that thaw quickly or huge breasts for those who like lots of meat.  Serve over rice, serve over pasta, or serve with a baked potato.  Love it, love it, love it!  Thanks for the recipe!  This recipe is going in our permanent rotation!

This was very enjoyable, made it as the recipe stated and my husband said that the chicken was very moist and juicy. I used medium salsa and it was a tad bit too much spice for my taste but he thought it was perfect. I served this over rice and it made enough juices to flavor the rice too.

Pretty good but a little too spicy for my family.  I will make again but with WAY less taco spice.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have taco seasoning so I used fajita seasoning instead. I loved the smoky flavor mixed with the sweetness of Pace mild picante sauce. Definitely making it again. Simple and tasty!

Great recipe! Perfect as is. I didn't make any changes and it was great! I did use the taco seasoning I from here and I'm so glad I did. Very simple, quick and delicious weeknight dinner.

The reason this recipe received 4 stars was the lack of taco seasoning taste. I think the chicken breasts were simply to thick. I would suggest using thinner breasts, so the taco seasoning is more dominant than the chicken flavor. If that works, my family would rate this a 5 star.

I am eating this right now.  I made this with a tortilla chip taco seasoning coat as was mentioned in another review.  I also cut my breasts in half to cut down on the cooking time, done in 25 minutes and was so juicy and nummy! Will be making this again!

I am working with a very easy to please husband and a very difficult to please 10 year old who thinks the only chicken is in nugget form.  This was super easy to make and we all enjoyed it very much. We modified the recipe in that we used dry Italian Dressing mix instead of Taco Mix as I am a spice wimp and salsa AND taco mix would have been too much.  It is in our favorites and I can see how easily it can be modified to individual tastes by varying the seasonings!

This recipe was really good but, most importantly, it was soooo easy and I had all of the ingredients at home already!  I didn't measure out the taco seasoning or bother putting it in a bag, I just poured some on the chicken breasts, patted it in, and flipped them over and did it again. Based on another review's suggestion, I used the Pace thick and chunky.  It was great!  I used Old El Paso's low sodium taco seasoning and medium salsa and it wasn't very spicy.  Next time I may do something to kick up a bit.

Like others suggested I marinated the chicken in the taco seasoning for a few hours before baking. I followed the recipe exact except I did not measure the salsa and cheese. I spooned the salsa over the chicken and made sure they were covered and sprinkled the cheese in the same fashion. It came out awesome. The only thing I may try next time is to add a tablespoon or two of lime juice to the marinade, other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

This was the best and easiest chicken casserole I've made in years!!  Didn't have to add anything extra.  Followed it exactly.  For taco seasoning, I used McCormicks Mild.  For salsa, I used Tostitos Mild.  Perfect blend of spices and flavors.  I love cheese so I was generous.  You really need to let it set for several minutes after baking to let the sauce thicken a bit and served with a dollup of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped green onions.  I prepared this dish a few hours before guests arrived, then let it set out a few minutes because it was chilled, put it in the oven for less than an hour and done.  I used skinless, boneless thighs, (personal preference)I served Spanish rice, corn and salad for my sides.  My guests loved it!!  Keeper forever!

Easy, Easy and Tasty. I used chicken tenderloins, lighted pounded and sprinkled the taco seasoning accordingly. Added some picante on the bottom as opposed to salsa, because we prefer a wetter chicken and than more picante  on top. Followed the rest of the recipe accordingly. I served this over white rice, topped with shredded lettuce with tomatoes , black olives and sour cream..... Perfecto.... Delicious... Thank You for Sharing.

Delicious!!! Great way to get your taco fix without having plain old tacos. I followed the recipe as written except I seasoned the chicken with poultry season before hand. My 6-year-old daughter gave it 100 and then asked more as leftovers the following night. Will definitely make this again.

This was really, really good and so simple to make! I was actually surprised at how good it was.  I tossed the chicken breasts in the taco seasoning and baked mine a little longer (they were big) and melted two cups of cheese on top.  My husband and two teenage boys gobbled it up!

This is so rediclously simple and so freaking good! My husband loved it and I loved it! I used a whole jar of chipotle pepper salsa, chicken thighs and the whole packet of spicy taco seasoning, other than that I did everything as directed. So yummy topped with jalapeños and avocados!! Te Amo Mucho!

Great recipe! It's simple, fast, easy, and tastes yummy. Everyone loved it! As someone mentioned before, I don't see the point in messing with this recipe. The only thing, next time I will try to make my own salsa.

I wasn't sure I was going to like this -- it looked too simple and pedestrian to be great. Boy was I surprised. I used organic chicken, Newman's Own pineapple salsa and the taco seasoning 1 recipe from this site.  Shook the chicken breasts in a ziplock bag with the taco seasoning until they were coated. Layered the bottom of a ceramic baking dish with salsa. placed the chicken on top of the salsa. Spooned more salsa over the top of the chicken. I baked it at 400 for about 40 minutes (thick breasts). In the last ten minutes I sprinkled the top with green onion and covered with lots of Mexican shredded cheese blend and baked until cheese was melted. I served this with Near East Spanish rice (which is the bomb) and made my own guacamole and severed it all with sour cream. This was an excellent meal for a weeknight. Fast, super easy and very tasty. You could even slice the meat and toss everything into a soft tortilla. This will go into the regular rotation.

This is amazingly good!  I dredged the chicken breasts in the taco seasoning as others suggested and used home made salsa since I didn't have any store bought on hand.  So easy to make.  Thanks!

This was AWESOME! I took some of the tips from other reviews and dredged the chicken in taco seasoning before baking it. Really good and not too spicy at all! My one year old loved it (minus the sour cream that I served on top my husband's and my piece).

So easy and delicious. Chicken always comes out juicy. I like a little more taco seasoning than it calls for. It's my go-to on nights when I'm too tired to "cook".

This recipe is unbelievably simple and a huge hit! I cooked it a little longer than it said, but the salsa kept the chicken so moist. We served with with brown rice and every single plate was clean. my one recommendation is to make your own taco seasoning-- it only takes a minute but it adds so much more flavor than the overly salty store-bought mix.

Absolutely astonishing. Take the number one advice. Instead of salsa, use tomatoes and peppers, instantly better.

Made this for lunch today with a friend.  We shook the chicken in seasoning in a bag as many of you suggested.  Also we weren't too particular about measuring any of the ingredients, and it turned out very good.  Topped it with sour cream and seasoned tortilla strips for some crunch and served with Mexican Rice II from this site.  Tasty and easy lunch!

I came across this one night when my boyfriend and I didn't want to order out, but didn't want to spend the evening cooking in the kitchen (there was a hockey game on!) and it was AMAZING! We served it with rice and black beans and with the leftovers the next morning we made huevos rancheros. So good.

First time with this recipe. My husband loved it. I took the advice of another reader and used the crushed tortilla chips and the taco seasoning mixed together to cover the chicken. I used olive oil instead of butter. Will be making this again.

So simple and very tasty.  I used boneless thighs (our preference) and the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site except I used 1 T. cayenne instead of 1 t.  Very easy with few ingredients.

We liked it. I would make it again. I followed the recipe exactly, except we needed at least 20 minutes more for cooking time as our chicken breasts were real thick.

I just made this as dinner. This was a good recipe and easy to follow. It's easy to make and you don't have to have a lot of ingrediants to make it. I love the combination of the salsa and chicken, two of my favorite ingrediants.

I was not expecting much from this recipe since there were only a few ingredients the recipe called for. I cooked this and my fiancé fell in love! We have now put it on our favorites! I added spaghetti sauce to the salsa mixture and poured it over rice. MMMM!

I absolutely LOVED this.  Was easiest thing ever & tasted delish!  Used ingredients suggested.... which is very rare for me to do.  I did accidentally add cheese at the same time as the other ingredients.  I was afraid the cheese may burn but decided to give it a whirl... turned out perfect!

I made this last night. My sons loved it! I added some frozen corn kernels to the pan after it came out of the oven. There was plenty of juice and the corn added a nice sweet taste. I served the chicken with plain white rice which was popular wiht my two year old. I also used a homemade taco seasoning to control salt and cost. I will be making this again!

I've been hearing about this recipe for years but for some reason haven't tried it. Good and very simple. I needed far less cheese than called for. I might use my slow cooker next time, because I find that it makes the chicken more tender than baking. Thanks!

AWESOME recipe for the working mom.  Put a layer of salsa on bottom of crock pot, lightly dredge chicken with Taco Seasoning (I used about 1/3 of the packet, low-sodium - otherwise, too salty!).  Per other user's recommendations, in addition to the salsa, I poured in a can of cream of chicken....cooked on low for 8 hours...mmmmmmm, perfect!!  served with the Quinoa and Black Beans on this site.  YUM!!!

AWESOME and easy!!  We baked the chicken over brown rice so we had to bump the cooking time up but the taco seasoning lended its flavor to the rice as well.  Due to the rice we had to cover the chicken tightly with foil until we added the cheese but this turned out so flavorful, easy as can be!!  We will have this again

All of these reviews sound absolutely wonderful.  I may consider making some changes every once in while to mix things up.  Fortunately this recipe works well on its own.  The only thing I did change (out of necessity) was the seasoning.  I didn't have taco seasoning and was too lazy to make my own (which I have done before using a Allrecipes recipe.) Instead, I used Tastefully Simple's Yahoo! seasoning.  Not sure how or if that changed the recipe significantly but the the chicken was incredible.  It was fast and easy, and my husband and kids enjoyed it.  All was right with the world.  :-)  Enjoy!

This was very easy to make, but didn't blow me away for flavor.  This is an easy weeknight dish to make (serve with refried beans and mexican rice) but isn't going to make anyone ask you for the recipe.

Very easy and tasty. Make sure not to overcook and feel free to add some chopped cilantro and olives for a better presentation.  My kids request this quite frequently.

Used as main dish at Christmas party.  Eight women who are all great cooks raved and wanted the recipe.  It was so simple and fast.  I used large fresh chick breasts and increased cook time to 45 min.  served also with dollop of guacamole, over yellow rice.

I have made this several times and it has been requested often! The ingredients are almost always on hand. So simple, yet tasty! One evening a friend was planning a dinner for some company of ours. She had looked high and low for the recipe she had planned to cook, but could not locate it. I offered to help her come up with something quick since dinner time was quickly approaching & she was running out of time. We decided on this, because we needed a quick solution. It was ready in no time and the company loved it! Even though it is not fancy like something you would normally serve your company, they didn't mind a bit! In fact they raved on and on about how good it was! Fancy isn't always better! :)

Perfect! I barely changed a thing. Only differences: I used shredded monterey jack cheese (we don't like cheddar in my family) and I used another recipe from this site for taco seasoning since I had no packaged on hand. Now, I'll never go back to packaged seasoning again, and this salsa chicken will become a staple in my home.

This was so simple to make and it tasted great.  I browned the chicken first, and used burrito seasoning in place of taco seasoning (store didn't have taco seasoning).  It's great as is, but could be made more elaborate by adding sauteed onions and garlic.  This is going in the recipe box!

I thought it was a great way to season the chicken breast. I've been making Salsa Chicken for awhile (not this recipe) and it didn't call for the taco seasoning which I thought was a nice idea. The salsa I used was pico de gallo (which lacked any juice) so I put some white wine in the baking dish to make it more aromatic. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is definately a keeper .After reading many of the reviews I picked what worked for us . Spray the bottom of the dish as well as putting a thin amt of salsa on the bottom ( I use the mild salsa ) the 1st time I made it I had fajhita seasoning and taco seasoning to make up for the amt needed it was awesome !I also use almost an entire jar of the salsa when cooking Yummy! Top with lots of extra cheese. The sour cream is a must just compliments it beautifully : )

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe and it was so easy to make. I  dredged the chicken with the taco seasoning by placing the seasoning in a ziploc bag and coating the entire breast. Instead of Cheddar Cheese, I used the Mexican Cheese mix. We had this with Mexican Corn and white rice.

This has become one of my go-to/easy-all-around dishes! The ingredients list is short, simple and inexpensive. It's easy to prep. And, it's Scrumptious (with a capital "S")! I use the chunkiest salsa I can find... usually with black beans and corn.  I've served it with a mashed potatoes and rice.  I recently made this with chicken tenderloins (vs. breast) and used it as filling for burritos along with sliced avocado, sour cream and a little lettuce.  Mmmm.... mmmm.... good!

Very simple yet very good. This was my first time making this. I was really looking for a reason to use the rest of my salsa I had in the fridge. Next time I'm gonna follow the other reviewer's advice and marinate the chx in the seasoning for a few hrs. I bet it will be even better.

This was pretty good. It was very easy. Thank you for sharing. I made the taco seasoning recipe from this website. I also used the Fresh Tomato Salsa recipe. I reduced the taco seasoning to 3 teaspoons as I had 3 chicken breasts, but I still think that was a little too much for us. If I make this again I will use even less.

Chicken ends up moist inside.  A quick and tasty recipe - not quite entertaining quality, but good for a weekday dinner. I used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream... it is sort of essential to this recipe if you eat it in a tortilla, so would say it's not really optional.  Otherwise, chicken can taste a bit one note with not enough textural variation.

I really wanted to like this because it was so easy.  But it wasn't a hit for me or my family. I was surprised we didn't like this more.  Sometimes I simmer shredded cooked chicken in salsa on the stove, and serve in flour tortillas with cheese.  My family loves this.  Maybe it was the taco seasoning in this recipe we didn't care for.  But 3 stars for being so easy.

I loved this recipe! I did not have cheddar cheese, but I had cheese dip so I used that. For the taco seasoning I used the recipe titled "Famous Taco Mix."

My "after-the-fact" observation is that this recipie is a no-brainer, but I never thought of it. It is super yummy! I did change it a bit given what I had in the pantry and how we wanted to eat dinner. I am a HUGE fan of the Taco Bell seasoning (in my humble opinion, it is the best out there short of going to the Mexican trucks parked on the side of the road - THOSE ARE THE BEST!!!) I used the Taco Bell Chipotle Taco Seasoning for the chicken, I reserved a little over 1/2 of the package and was very generous with the salsa. I did not bake it with the cheese at the end, instead, I shredded the chickn in the hot salsa and mixed it all together. We used the chicken on the top of taco salads and the sauce in the pan was more than enough for the salad. I used the remaining package of seasoning to season the rice while it cooked. Very yummy! Thank you!

This will definately be a keeper in our household. Cooked it for the first time (with a few necessary changes/substitutions) and love it! Very flavorful. I will say that I did not have any taco seasoning as the recipe called for so I just seasoned with chili powder, salt, pepper, and a little cumin and instead of salsa I used Pace Mild Picante Sauce (not much difference there).

Awesome recipe! Very, very tender! Based on reviews I added a little water to the seasoning, threw it in a plastic bag and coated the chicken. I also cut the chicken into smaller chunks because I was feeding little boys too. It was very easy for them to handle and not too spicy thanks to the additional water. I served the chicken over plain white rice and some salsa.Thanks bunches for the GREAT recipe.

This was ok, but the chicken turned out dry and most of the salsa and cheese sort of slid off while trying to eat it. I think I will try it one more time, using smaller chicken breasts. The ones I used were very large, and I think this recipe would work out better with a thinner chicken breast. My boyfriend did like it though, and ate the leftovers so I will give it a 3 star rating.

I made recipe as written... Good.... But then I made recipe as top reviewer, 79SHALE97, writes... except I do not use rotel, I just use salsa. Coat dish with semi drained diced tomatoes, with the same time and temp, and let it sit with foil.... and WOW. Maybe we just have similar ovens, but it comes out PERFECT. The chicken is crazy juicy yummy. Thanks! I've made it a dozen or so times now- and my husband and I both crave it so bad sometimes, we don't wantr anything else.

Love love love it! I have a two year old so I don't have a lot of time to cook. Not only is it fast and simple,  but it doesn't skimp on the flavor for us adults but isn't to harsh for the little one!

This was my first allrecipes dish, and remains the one that I cook the most! My husband loves it and requests it a lot (except in the summer when it's too hot to bake). I have no changes, other than I don't use exact quantities for the ingredients, just eyeball what looks/tastes good.

Very quick, very easy. I was able to clean the house and chop up a salad while it cooked. The chicken was tender and absolutely delicious. I added tobasco and jalepenos, and instead of salsa took the chopped tomatoes suggestions (we didn't have salsa). A-mazing. For how quick and easy it was...the taste is astounding!

Very easy to prepare. I didn't sprinkle the chicken evenly with the taco seasoning so some spots were too heavy while others were too light. I will try using a shaker the next time. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

I read someone's review and put the chicken in a ziplock bag to cover the chicken with the taco seasoning.  It turned out so juicy and fabulous!

I used spicy taco seasoning and salsa.  Too much heat for me at that point, but the boyfriend enjoyed it.  I'll make it again, this time with regular seasoning.

Delicious!  We all loved it!  After my 4-year-old took a bit he said, "Oh wow!  This is very yummy!", which is huge because he doesn't like anything with tomatoes.  We had Spanish rice on the side and it was a nice compliment to the chicken.  My husband went on and on about how much he liked this recipe.  He even did the cooking!  He accidentally put in about twice as much salsa as the recipe called for, and it was still great and not at all overwhelming.  Tasty, easy recipe!

Fantastic.  Chicken was so flavorful and moist and prep time was less than 10 minutes.  Great weeknight meal and relatively healthy.  Added black olive slices under the cheese for one child and jarred jalapeno slices under the cheese for the other, which made a great addition.

Great easy recipe for those busy weekday evenings.  Allrecipes put this one in my email in box.  I thought I would give it a try.  My family loved it, which isn't an easy feat.  Didn't alter the recipe at all.  Served with some Mexican rice and steamed broccoli....perfect!

I make this all the time. I serve it over rice. I omit the cheese and sour cream for health reasons, and it is very good.

delicious. i followed the reciped to a T except, i used an entire packet of taco mix. i just coated all 3 breasts thoroughly w/ it. i can imagine if i had only used 4 tsps, the chicken would not have been as flavorful.

I made this last night and it was very good.  I rubbed the taco seasoning into both sides of the chicken breasts rather than sprinke it over it.  After it was done cooking, we sliced it up and used flour shells to make fajaitas/tacos with it.  Will make again.

Very tasty.  Of course for a healthy option we used low sodium seasoning and low fat sour cream.  Very simple recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe! Including my picky father-in-law who is a salt and pepper kind of guy. SUPER easy and very inexpensive to make. I do not out the taco seasoning n the chicken because I get the garlic & lime salsa and the black bean and white corn salsa and mix them together. It is very yummy

Tried and LOVED this recipe, but next time I will adjust the Taco Seasoning or use something else.  I find it to be a tad too salty.  This was a simple, easy recipe that can be made for dinner on a busy night!  LOVE IT!

Wow, so EASY and so MOIST! My Toddler ate this up! We used mild salsa and spread liberally over chicken and it was so good and done in 20 minutes. A great go-to recipe with ingredients on hand!

I made this for the first time recently and it was a big hit.  I used skinless thighs since my family prefers dark meat, a medium roasted tomato salsa and forgot to add the dab of sour cream, but it wasn't missed.  Next time I might try it in the crockpot.  Great recipe and I look forward to trying different salsas with it.

Made exactly like the recipe, using Taco Seasoning II from this site instead of packaged seasoning and a homemade salsa.. Incredibly moist and flavorful. LOVED it and will make again soon!

I followed what another reviewer wrote and used Rotel tomatoes and green chillis and it came out too spicy for hubby.  Next time I think I will use cheesy taco mix and mild salsa :)

This was SO easy and tasty!!!  I used an Archer Farms salsa from Target...the corn and bean one and it really added to it...even my boyfriend said "Wow...I am so surprised at how good this was!"

I am forever looking for new ways to fix chicken and this will defintely go in the rotation!  Awesome recipe, very flavorful!  The only minor adustment I made was using a can of Rotel instead of salsa.  It turned out great!

Delicious, spicy and oh so easy.  I use white sharp cheddar and leave off the sour cream, it's perfect.  I can't get enough of this recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

So easy, and so tasty! I pulled the chicken out at the end, shredded it, then back into the sauce. I used a couple tablespoons of corn starch to thicken up the sauce, and added a bit more sour cream (mixed into the sauce). After all ingredients marinated in a warm slow cooker for awhile I piled the shredded chicken into soft taco shells. Yum! Makes great leftovers too.

Very Good! Tastes like it should be so much work, but really quite simple!
I used what I had on hand. For the salsa I mixed- RoTel (lime and cilantro), Pace medium salsa, Sliced black olives, and some minced garlic. Served it over 90 second Spanish rice.

You look at this recipe and think, "It's too easy. It can't be that good." But it is. Easy, cheap, fast, good. It's even healthy for you, if you go easy on the sour cream. For a busy cook, this is a great go-to chicken recipe.

Great recipe! Very easy to make. I didn't add the cheese and used the chicken for the filling of chicken tacos. I've seen others comment that it was too spicy, but I thought it was just right and I prefer my Mexican dishes to be mild. The chicken was very tender and shredded easily. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was absolutely awesome! It was super incredibly easy to make and came out wonderfully. I added some black olives just for a little extra texture, but other than that it was perfect as is.

Very good quick meal. I rubbed the chicken breasts with a marinade of olive oil, crushed garlic and the taco seasoning and let it sit in the fridge for an hour prior to cooking and it came out great.

I used home made pico de gallo, so it's wasn't as flavorful.  I compensated by adding more taco seasoning, but it just the dish still didn't have that bang.  I think it's healthy, and good with the corn tortillas I baked in the oven and rice and beans.  Nice mix of flavor and texture.

Excellent! We seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash southwest chipotle seasoning and topped with a mild, chunky salsa...skipped the cheese and sour cream for a tad healthier version.   Definitely will be making this again.

I needed a quick recipe for Saturday night dinner and this definitely filled the bill! It was quick, easy, and delicious. I used a roasted salsa with chipotle and it gave a wonderful depth to the flavor.l I, too, used the Mexican blend cheese. This one is a keeper! Thanks, Faye!

I have made this several times and my family loves it and it is so easy.  My Daughter doesn't care for tomatoes or salsa so I cook the chicken with the salsa covering it and then scrape it off before putting the cheese on it to cook the extra few minutes.  This is definately a go to recipe

Excellent recipe. I sprinkled taco seasoning on both sides, but found that it was too spicy for my taste. Next time, I will just sprinkle it on the top. I used less cheese and salsa than called for, but the recipe still came out wonderfully. Also had trouble with both chicken and salsa sticking onto my nonstick pans, even though it was greased. I'll use foil underneath my chicken next time.

I always check out reviewers' tips before I cook something from here to see if there should be any modifications, but I followed the recipe this time. The only thing I did differently was I used chicken breast tenderloins because I was out of breast halves. This was absolutely delicious. Thank you! I will be making this again.

Could this be any simpler? And wow, the chicken comes out SOOOOO tender. It's crazy. This is the perfect dish to make when you're low on ingredient or simply don't feel like making a lavish dinner, but sitll want something yummy. I served with cilantro lime rice and black bean soup. Fantastic!

Very good and so easy to fix. The chicken stayed nice and moist and it was great with some rice and a fresh corn salad. It only took a minute to put together and that is precious time when you have a toddler.

Super easy and nice flavor. I would recommend butterlying the chicken if they are thick as the seasoning didn't make it into the breast. If you are planning ahead, put the taco seasoning on the night before and let it really sink in. Topped with some black beans for fiber and texture and the presentation was really nice. Can't wait to make quesadillas with the leftovers!

I don't know what everyone was raving about.  I thought this was pretty boring.  I think I'll shred the chicken and use it in some enchiladas or queso.

I've made this a couple times and can't believe I keep forgetting to rate this!  This makes such moist and juicy chicken!  To make it hotter, replace some of the salsa with the Rotel can of hot tomatoes!!

This was a great inspiration! The only modification we made was to add panko crumbs to the coating. It turned out juicy and crunchy and the salsa on top was great!

This was so easy and good.  I just seasoned both sides of chicken breasts, threw some salsa on top and cooked until done - threw on some mexican cheese at last minute to melt.  My hubby and kids ended up cutting up the chicken and putting in wraps.  served with spanish rice and black beans.  hit!!!

LOVED THIS! I changed it a bit, i used tenderloins instead but i wish i had breasts. I also used taco sauce instead of salsa, so amaazzzingg. I also used some of the taco seasonings and pepper mixed into white rice as i cooked it and it made an amazing bed to put the chicken on. this is a quick easy and delicious reciepe i love

This was fantastic. I made it today and the only thing I changed was cooking it in the crockpot. It was a nice warm surprise for friends who had been on vacation and came home to lots of snow. I will definitely make it again!

I was skeptical at first...but this was great!  I varied it based on what I had in the kitchen...fajita sauce vs. taco seasoning, and left out the cheese and sour cream, and it was still delish!  Note:  Make sure you get a higher quality salsa, the flavor is important

Perfect recipe!  Simple, quick, delicious.  When I went home to make this a few weeks ago I found that what used to be a full jar of salsa was now only a couple of tablespoons.  So I changed things up a bit with great success.  Next to the near empty jar of salsa was a half jar of leftover homemade pizza sauce.  So I sprinkled the chicken with some Italian seasoning and a little garlic salt, covered them with pizza sauce, baked as directed, topped w/cheddar cheese and finished baking.  Fantastic!!  Not sure which way I prefer - the Mexican or Italian version - but excellent recipe!

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes.  It's so simple.  I only use the salsa and after the chicken is done I top it with provolone cheese & serve it over rice.  Super easy & delish.

Love this recipe. I had three breast that were cooked perfectly after 25 min. Make sure to pound them down first. I used Taco Seasoning I from this site and Trader Joe's salsa. A little cheddar on top...Yum!

I made this last night and all I can say is WOW!  Easy and super-delicious.  I didn't change a thing except I sprinkled a bit more taco mix on the chicken breasts.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe.

Had some frozen chicken breasts that were Tequila lime flavored and was in a hurry for dinner.  Thawed them, cooked according to the directions here.  I omitted the taco seasoning since they were already flavored.  the only other change was some black olives added to the top and some fresh cilantro when I served them.  As others have said, great flavor for such a simple dish.

I love this recipe because it's super simple, but it tastes like quite a bit of work went into it.  The chicken comes out moist and flavorful.  I've made it twice, once with monterey jack cheese and the other with cheddar.  I think i prefer the monterey jack cheese a little bit more, but regardless of the cheese this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Awesome!! for 3 reasons. 1. picky eaters in my family love it. 2. easy to make 3. versitile can add a bunch of other things. I pounded the chicken out and made corn muffins alongside. My picky hubby says "honey, add it to the list"

This recipe is so easy and good.  I mix up my own taco seasoning and sprinkle it on the breasts and serve with rice and corn.  My husband, who isn't a big fan of chicken, also really likes it.  A keeper for sure.

So easy and very tasty - my niece and nephew loved it!! I prefer using boneless, skinless chicken thighs rather than breast meat.  Also, I use the Taco Seasoning I recipe also found on this site.

Baked at 35 Minutes and it came out wonderfully juicy! I basically altered the entire recipe but used the cooking directions and loved it! I coated the chicken in my special cajun seasoning.  Mixed up a small batch of fire-roasted salsa and ranch. Put a thin layer of that concoction on, then placed more fire-roasted salsa on top.  Finished it with pepper jack cheese. YUM!

This was great!  Super easy to throw together and very flavorful.  It's one of those "Why didn't I think of that?" recipes.  I subbed 5 skinless chicken thighs instead of 4 skin/boneless breasts and omitted the sour cream to make this even more economical.  I paired it with Mexican Rice I from this site and some refried beans & shredded lettuce.  We will definitely be making this again!

I made this tonight and, while the flavor was great, the directions were horrid.  I did ad about a teaspoon of cumin and shook the chicken in a bag with the spices.  However, after 30 minutes at 375 degrees the chicken was raw.  I ended up broiling it on high for 20 minutes so I could get dinner on the table, next time I'll just broil it.

Very good. I made it exactly as the recipe states. I don't see the need to mess with it. It's supposed to be a simple, tasty recipe. It bothers me how so many reviewers took this easy recipe and tried to make it difficult and completely different.  It's good as is.  I gave it 5 stars because I did it the way the original poster wanted it and loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I could give this recipe 4 1/2 stars. Its a great quick weeknight recipe. It couldn't be simplier and it has a great flavor, but I like to save 5 stars for recipes that are truly outstanding. I made this exactly as described and I'll definitely be adding it to the rotation.

This chicken was absolutely delicious! Very easy and quick to preper, I added my homemade taco seasoning the night before. I also reduced the salsa to only 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup tomato sauce just because other reviewers mentioned that it was too much salsa. It turned out very juice, nice and tender. Served with mexican rice, homemade guacamole and steamed veggies.

LOVED LOVED LOVED this! F All of my kids loved it and my youngest kept telling me he loved it so much! I did make one substitutions from the original recipe and that was 2% mexican blend shredded cheese as that's what I had on hand.  This is a keeper and a new regular to our meal rotation! The kids all suggested that next time I put some olives on with the cheese, and I tend to agree! Otherwise, FABULOUSLY EASY!

The only reason that I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because my boyfriend and I love spicy food, so we tweeked the recipe a tad.  Instead of 4 tsp of taco seasoning, I used a whole packet and sprinkled it over the 4 chicken breasts along with a sprinkling of seasoning salt.  I also added onion slices and fresh mushrooms on top of the chicken and then added the salsa.  I used up 2 slices of pepper jack cheese that I had left over and also added shredded cheese (mexican style blend).  My boyfriend and I really liked it!  We ate it with sour cream on top, mexican rice, and tortillas.  We ended up ditching the tortillas and just ate the chicken! I would definitely make this again!

I always pound boneless chicken for recipes like this as i find the chicken is so much more tender and flavorful. I know it's not fun to pound chicken but its worth the effort. I cover the chicken with tin foil and use my rolling pin. I made this with homemade taco seasoning and it came out very moist and quite delicious.

I am rating this so highly for two reasons 1) I love recipes that are simple - 5 ingredients or less.  2) It was really quite tasty, and my hubby absolutely loved it, as did I.  So so simple which is always a big +.

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING! I'm not a huge salsa fan and neither is my husband, but we somehow had 2 jars, and not a ton of ingredients on hand. I used the taco seasoning and salsa, and then some cheese sauce (from a jar), and I sprinkled some random shredded cheese that we had, and mashed up some Fritos to add some crunchiness. This is truly one of the BEST chicken recipes that I've made. I will DEFINITELY be making this a LOT in the future. Thanks!!!

I gave it 4 stars because it is so dang easy.. Lacked a bit in flavor for me. I made it as suggested but next time will experiment with fresh salsa and make my own seasoning.

Perfect weeknight meal! You can get this in the oven in 2 minutes. I used taco seasoning I from this site (you can really cut down on the sodium when you make your own). Chicken turned out tender and delicious.

This recipe was VERY easy and tasted great.  I spread some fat free refried beans over the chicken before the salsa, and used reduced fat cheese, and fat free sour cream to make it a bit lighter.  My whole family enjoyed it!

This was AMAZING!!!  Tender, juicy.  I lightened it up with low fat cheese and low fat sour cream...I'm SO glad I have leftovers!!!  A side of multi-grain rice and broccoli and it was gone.  Thank you for this wonderful piece of heaven!!!

Good recipe. I cut each breast in half then put them in a gallon size plastic bag. I pounded each piece until they were between a quarter to half an inch thick. Using a fork I poked holes in each piece before adding the taco seasoning. I also added extra cheese. Very tender and tasty.

Phenomenal!!! This was one of THE BEST chicken dishes I've ever had!!! I seasoned the chicken with Taco Seasoning I from this site and spooned enough salsa over the breasts and around the dish with some extra salsa liquid poured in. I put the dish into the fridge for about 10-15 minutes while preparing Mexican Rice II from this site. I let the chicken bake for 30 minutes before throwing a couple of slices of colby jack (closest thing I had to cheddar) on top of each breast. At that time, I also threw some spinach into the dish and mixed it into the liquid. I turned on the broiler until the cheese was bubbly and golden. The chicken was sooo moist and tender from baking in the salsa!!! It also had great flavor from the seasoning! My mom, who hates chicken breasts because they tend to be dry, loved this dish! She couldn't believe chicken breasts could actually be so tasty and tender! I can't wait to make salsa chicken again! Thanks! I just realized I had forgotten all about the sour cream. Either way, it was still delicious!

Actually made a sort of "shepherds pie" - Mexican style!  Made this chicken - cut it up small and layered it with corn/onions, and sauteed then mashed potatoes with some hots for spiciness.  When serving, put out sour cream and salsa for guests to add to taste. Excellent!  Thanks for the inspiration!

Five stars because it is super fast and super yummy! I used chicken tenders rather than chicken breasts so that each  bite of chicken would be seasoned. I'm so glad I did. DELICIOUS. I served it with steamed veggies, spanish rice, and refried beans. Will make it again!

My boyfriend and I definitely enjoyed this.  I put the chicken in a ziplock bag with the taco seasoning, which I think is a must!  Per 79Shale97's review, I used the Rotel tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro and am glad I used that instead of salsa.  I also used blended monterey jack with cheddar cheese because it was what I had on hand.  Other than that, I did everything the same as written.  It was a lot more spicy than we were expecting, but just right for our tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Taste like enchiladas without tortilla.  Used 2 chicken breast, half jar of salsa, and half package of low sodium taco seasoning.  Spicy! YUm. Great use of leftovers!

This recipe was good, not great.  I think the use of the taco seasoning mix along with the salsa was too spicy.  I made one for my son w/o the taco seasoning mix and liked that much better.  Will make again, but w/o the taco seasoning mix.

Great Recipe, I changed it up just a little. First I pound out the chicken breast then I season with Salt, Garlic Powder and pepper. I then use two packs of taco seasoning in a ziplock bag and coat each breast with the taco seasoning. I cook two boxes of Spanish rice and put the rice in the baking dish. I place the chicken breast over the rice and top with chucky salsa and bake for 30 minutes. The last 5 minutes I add the shredded cheese and crunched tortilla chips. This is a regular in our house!

This really is quite yummy! I always end up shredding it up after it's cooked and making chicken tacos. Very good! I'm going try some of the other's suggestions this time around like adding black beans, corn, sweet salsa, etc... Sounds great!

I loved it and my husband gave it an 8 out of 10. The only change I made was to put salsa on the bottom of the pan. Probably would have been better if I followed the recipe and just greased the bottom. Hubby said there was a little too much salsa. I will definitely make it again and follow the recipe exactly! Yum!

So easy to make and SO very delicious! I pound the chicken breasts and cut them in half (if they are big.) I also add about 1/2 cup of corn. Tonight I used PINEAPPLE SALSA and it was YUMMY!

Excellent :). I used chili seasoning because I didn't have any taco seasoning and it turned out delicious. The chicken was so moist. My kids (2 and 5) loved it.

I've upped my review to 5 stars, because in retrospect, this dish was very tasty considering how quick and easy it was!  I did not grease the pan--instead I did what another reviewer suggested and put a little bit of salsa on the bottom of the pan before adding the chicken.

This was extremely tasty. I used a little more taco seasoning and a can of petite diced tomatoes in place of the salsa. Yum!

I pan fried the chicken instead of baking and it still turned out pretty good. Used Taco Seasoning I from this site and marinated for about an hour beforehand. Served with Spanish Rice Original.

I make this a few times a month. Now, I skip the taco packet. I just layer salsa and cheese on top of the chicken. We like it better this way.

This recipe is wonderfully simple and delicious. I, too, used a plastic zip bag into which I poured a package of Old El Paso cheesy taco seasoning. I used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs and most of a bottle of Pace mild chunky salsa. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I'll be making this one regularly.

LOVED this recipe. Very easy and used simple ingredients I already had at home. Husband loved it. Use a really good salsa though, as that will make all the difference. Chicken was very flavorful and moist

I made this in my slow cooker today and it was amazing!  I actually added some cream of chicken, then added the salsa.  It made an amazing sauce!  My husband even liked it - and he's hard to please!

Wow so simple but so delicious! I did make a couple changes...My family has their own taco seasoning recipe, which is quite spicy so I marinated the chicken for 8 hours in a mix of water, 1 T hot taco seasoning, some minced garlic and about 2 t of fresh lime juice. I cooked it with medium Mission salsa with cheese and it was absolutely delicious...My husband loves salsa so he gobbled it up and wanted me to "add it to the recipe box" Thanks for the delicious and EASY meal!

This is one of my favorite dishes from this site! I make it just like the recipe states except I use Velveeta cheese and Joe T. Garcia's salsa. I serve it over Spanish rice. The chicken is sooo tender and juicy. LOVE IT!!!

This was great and very easy to make.  I poured enough salsa to cover the bottom of my pan and poured more over the top of the chicken.  I loved that I didn't have to measure anything for this recipe!  Very tender chicken.

Didn't change a thing. This was so flavorful and easy to make.  Used Taco Seasoning I from this site.

This was great and so fast and easy. I cut the chicken breast in half so I could take out the thinner part, and it doesn't dry out while trying to cook the thick part. I used Essentia Southwestern Salsa-Medium. This salsa has black beans and corn and is very tasty. Served it with tortillas. My husband loved it.

This was SO DELICIOUS!!!!  First, it was so easy to make, with very little ingredients.  Second, it was full of lots of flavor.  I shared my piece of chicken with my four year old since I never eat a full piece.  I wish I hadn't shared because I could've devoured the entire piece.  I absolutely recommend this recipe!!!

Sooo good! Used half the taco seasoning packet with 40% less sodium and it turned out perfect.

This was just okay. The spiciness drowned out any other taste. I will try this again but will tweek the taco seasoning.

I didn't have any taco seasoning, and noting other reviewers' comments regarding the saltiness I decided it would be OK to skip that.  I just seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, and cumin, then put it in the baking pan and covered with the salsa.  I used cheese slices instead of the grated cheese, which ends up being a little neater.  This turned out very tender and tasty, and couldn't have been easier.

The only change I made was to use light sour cream.  Excellent taste.  My husband loved it.  Not real good reheated the next day but wonderful straight out of the oven! Thanks for a recipe that offers a different taste.

I used Pace Picante Medium Salsa (cuz we get the big jug from Costco!) and I used "Hot" taco seasoning. I thought the flavor was perfect. I put all the ingredients in a crock pot and the chicken was oh so moist and juicy! The only thing I would change next time... is I think it would be better used for a burrito filling.

My husband loved this recipe.  Me on the other hand, I didn't care for it.  Thought it had way too much taco seasoning.  If I did make it again (for my husband), I wouldn't coat the seasoning on both sides and would cut way down on the other side.  On the plus side, it was very easy to make and the chicken came out very tender.

Very simple!  An easy, quick weeknight meal.  I made my own taco seasoning from the Taco Seasoning I and rubbed it in.  Perfect amount of seasoning.  I didn't measure the salsa; just dumped it on, and it was perfect.  Baked for 35 min, then 5 min for the cheese. Thanks!

Really good and so easy!  I'm always looking for good, quick chicken breast recipes and this is a keeper for week night dinners.  The chicken was very tender.  I served it with steamed veggies, bean dip and some baked tortilla chips.

YummmmYummmmmYummmmm.....I used three large chicken breasts and sprinkled the taco seasoning on them freely (no measuring here) then covered each with an equal amount of salsa (probably more than the 1c called for in the recipe as the pieces of chicken were quite large).  I baked until just done, sprinkled cheese over them and finished cooking as the cheese melted. I then sliced the chicken into 1/2 thick strips and placed 3 or 4 slices on a warmed low carb tortilla that I had spread liberally w/ low fat sour cream, then I topped then with a smidgeon of freshly grated jack cheese.  These were wonderful....kudos for sharing such a simple yet wonderfully flavorful recipe.

Yummmmm.  This is so easy and so good.  So many possibilities for the resulting moist and flavorful chicken, if you want to take it a step further.  Sliced over salad, shredded into taco shells, chopped and paired with rice and black beans and sour cream/cheese/guacamole/you name it for an amazing burrito.  I plan on making this A LOT!  (Incidentally, used a whole package of reduced sodium taco seasoning and a whole jar of mild salsa on 6 breasts and all my kids loved it--ages 2, 3, and 7--"spicy" is definitely in the eye [tongue?] of the beholder.)

Excellent! Took me 2 minutes to whip together. I didn't have to measure anything-- just sprinkled everything over each piece of chicken. I made my salsa (D's famous salsa from this site) and dipped the chicken in fat free sour cream while eating. Yum!

This is one of the easiest recipes ever, and it is also excellent tasting. The chicken was juicy and tender. I added taco sauce, hot sauce, and some chopped zuchinni to the salsa. I served it along with sweet white corn. very good!

I gave this 5 stars, not because it's gourmet by any means, but because it looks and tastes wonderful and is accomplished with next to no effort (a big plus when you have a child to help with homework after school while chasing a one year old!). Plus it's a big hit with the kids and company too! Have made this numerous times, and have also experimented by making it Italian for variety (just substituted spaghetti/Italian seasoning for the taco seasoning and spaghetti sauce for the salsa, and mozzarella for the cheddar). It worked out well too, but our fave is still the original recipe.

This recipe was awesome for how cheap it was and how little work I had to put into it. Even the picky boyfriend who HATES Mexican food (I know right?) went back for 2nds. 

I used Salsa Verde instead of regular salsa and it was delicious. Also, next time I might pound the chicken breast so they are thinner.

All in all it was tender, flavorful, and CHEAP! Woo! Will definitely make again.

This is easily the easiest recipe I have ever made.  It turned out really good both times.  Once I made it with frozen chicken breasts (bought frozen and thawed) and once with regular chicken.  It came out more tender with the frozen.  everyone in the house liked it as well even my dad who hates spicy stuff.  I used mild taco seasoning and mild salsa.  I didn't measure anything out.  I did add the whole jar of salsa instead of just a cup.  I am not sure how big the jar was but I would say about half a cup more of salsa.

This is really good. Quick and easy too!
I make my own blend of spices instead of the taco seasoning packet.

As written, this is an easy peasy and tasty recipe. It's easy to oomph it up a little too - I added a couple of finely diced serrano peppers and some lime juice to the salsa mix. I also sprinkled some fresh cilantro over the melty cheese. Thanks!

This is a great simple recipe for a weekday dinner.  I have also modified it slightly to accomodate different ingredients I had on hand.  Usually I take a package of taco seasoning (sometimes two) and dump it into a freezer bag and then I toss the chicken in the bag.  I put the chicken in a baking dish and cover it with taco sauce (versus salsa) and cheese.  I usually serve it with mexican rice.  Delicious!

Our entire family enjoyed this recipe. I make my own salsa (very hot) and so I didn't top the chicken that my boys at with it. My only critique is following the advice of others of putting chicken in a baggie and coating it with the taco seasoning. That made the chicken too salty with coating on all sides. We'll sprinkle it on as stated in the recipe. Thanks!

This was the best and juiciest chicken I have ever made!  I was skeptical bc of the lack of ingredients but it was delicious.  The only thing I did differently was that I lined a casserole dish with aluminum foil and then put one can of black beans (drained and rinsed) before putting the chicken on top. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I actually used ground beef for this dish.  It turns out very good.  I think you can use any kind of meat and still have a good result.

ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!!!  i used greated fresh parmesan, white sharp chedder and mozzarella instead.  I'm the world's toughest critic when it comes to food and this was a GREAT chicken dish!!!    i paired if off with a spicy green bean recipe that was also wonderful (it wasn't spicy but delicious):   http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Spicy-Green-Beans/Detail.aspx?prop31=2

YUMMMM can't wait to eat the leftovers.  oh yeah , i also used organic chicken breast b/c it has no growth hormones and is very tender!!!

Love this recipe!  I have been making the slow cooker version (which is a goopy mess) for so many years that it never occured to me to just bake it in the oven.  This version is SO much better!  I am tossing the other recipe and replacing with this one.  Thanks for sharing!

Tasted good, quick and easy to prepare.  Fantastic but not outstanding.  I used a refrigerated "restaurant style" salsa.

Could not believe how easy this was.
I was nervous to use fresh salsa, but it turned out fantastic.  We also added black beans to our chicken and then covered with cheese.  This one is a quick fix meal that I will use for many years!

Very good recipe. We liked it very much. I think that the taco seasoning is too salty, so instead I sprinkled chili powder and cumin on both sides of the chicken breasts for flavor. At one time I shredded the chicken and mixed it back into the salsa/cheese mixture for chicken tacos. YUM!

Pretty good. I reduced taco seasoning for myself and left the same for my husband - he likes spicy food. I also used provologne cheese, all I had. Quick and easy.

I made this for my 4 kids, 10 to 4, and my husband. My husband really liked it but it was a little strong for my kids and I thought it was a little overpowering. I think this is a more adult dish and may hold off on making this again.

Wowza was this salty.  I will either try the low salt taco seasoning or less of it next time.  The salsa/cheese/sour cream combo was very good and the chicken came out very moist.  It was the salt factor that ruined it for me though.  But I think it has the potential to be a '5 star' recipe with some modifications to the taco seasoning.  Extra points for coming together in minutes!

This recipe is so easy my husband loves making it.  It is so good!  I suggest lining your pan with aluminum foil, and sour cream is a must!

You cannot get any easier for such a great dish!! This dish is so simple to make, just assemble the ingredients and bake, nothing else to it! I would not recommend changing a thing. I will serve this with spanish rice, or on a bed of lettuce, or in a tortilla...always with some extra salsa on the side. So good!

Simple, tasty, & fabulous dinner choice for this mother of 3.  27 minutes in the oven was all it took - like a chicken soft taco with half the effort.

Based on previous suggestions, I marinated the chicken with the taco seasoning package and 2/3 cup of water for about 1-2 hours before baking.  Spiciness was perfect!  Chicken came out very tender and flavorful.  Thanks, Faye!

Wow! This was easy and delicious. I coated both sides well with taco seasoning. I used hot salsa for the topping. The chicken was moist and tender and full of flavor. Great for a quick dinner.

VERY easy recipe! No marinating needed, which was perfect for a quick last minute idea.  The chicken tasted wonderful and stayed moist.  We made it with Mexican rice, as someone else suggested and it was really delightful.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I made this one last night, used salsa and a spicier chili salsa found in a local latin market.  I also added some fresh onion and garlic and a few teaspoons of cumin to add a dash of depth and a more homemade taste to the chicken.  I baked it on 375F for 40 minutes and it was fabulous!

Here goes another great review.  Very simple and tasty.  I split my chicken breast so they would cook faster.  Seasoned both sides with the taco seasoning, baked for 20 minutes then added the salsa and cooked 5 minutes more, added cheese i used the shredded mexican mix, served over rice with a little of the juice and topped with sour cream.  Quick fast and tasty, great weeknight meal.

I made this in the skillet instead of turning the oven on. I added a squeeze of lime and skipped the sour cream but it was certainly tasty.

This is one of those recipes that is *so* easy that you wonder why you hadn't thought of it before.  A snap to put together, ingredients I typically have on hand anyway, but easily accommodating and/or changeable.  I used mild salsa, taco seasoning that I had left over from a couple weeks ago (half of a spice pack) and 2% colby jack cheese.  I used five thin chicken cutlets and they only took about fifteen minutes to cook; who needs a thirty minute meal when you have a twenty minute one?  Served with Spanish rice (from a package, I'm lazy), fat free refried beans and corn.  Made great leftovers, as well!

Super easy and yummy! I just sprinkled the taco seasoning on the top of the chicken adn I found that was sufficient. The seasoning I has was labeled "hot" and I used Pace Picante "hot" salsa and it was nice an dspicy. My boyfriend loves spicy so it went over well. Served it with the black beans and rice recipe from this site. Nice flavourful and colourful meal. Thanks!

SO simple and adds so much flavor to the Chicken. I did not change a thing - well I didn't measure the sauce just dumped some on.I also covered it - uncovered it at the end when I topped it with cheese. Super Recipe !!!

Tastes like a quesadilla without the tortilla!  I marinated the chicken breasts in the taco seasoning for about 1 hour prior to cooking, then followed the recipe.

My picky husband loved this chicken. That fact all by itself gave this 5 stars! Would taste great shredded up and served over nacho chips or in taco shells.

I used Taco Seasoning III on this site to coat the chicken. I liked it but I think I did not like the salse hot. Next time I will cook this without the salsa and add the salsa on afterwards.

My family loves this. They would eat it every night if I would let them. My 7 year old think's that it is "fabulous!" I like to use the thinly sliced chicken breasts. They do cook faster though. 15 min. or so.

I thought this recipe was great for how easy it was.  I marinated the chicken in the taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I) and water and used Rotel tomatoes.  I'll definitely do it again for how quick, easy and convenient everything was.  Thanks for the recipe!  Went great with potatoes and green beans.

Made this tonight, and as predicted, my son scraped off the salsa and cheese...oh well. My DH and I liked this just fine as a quick and easy meal. I used chicken thighs, which I do not recommend. Much easier and neater with breasts I'm sure. Decent dinner w/o much difficulty.

This was really good and easy.  I pounded the chicken breasts thin so they'd cook evenly and be tender, and I used low-fat cheddar and fat free sour cream.  Didn't know how to tell when the chicken's juices ran clear, since it was covered in salsa, but I just took it out and sliced into one to see if it was done.  Will make again.

This was a good, easy chicken recipe.  I think for people that love salsa, this could be a five. I pounded my chicken breasts to about 3/4 inch, so they would bake faster, took about 20 mins. at 375 deg. oven.  Oh, and used a whole jar of salsa to cover three flattened, spread out breasts.  I will make this again, and might try slicing up cooked chicken to put in a tortilla.

This was really good. I needed something for a Weight Watcher's meal, you get alot of flavor, without counting it into your points.
I used a pineapple salsa and it was really good even without any cheese.  On my husband's I topped his with cheddar, which he enjoyed.

This isn't a five-star recipe, necessarily, but this chicken is delish!! I worried that it wouldn't have much flavor, since it wasn't marinated before hand. But I followed the recipe for the first time and I'm glad I did! It has a great great taste ... without being overwhelmingly "taco-" or "salsa-flavored." The salsa gives the chicken a delicious flavor. Will definitely go on repeat at my house.

I liked this overall but it was still pretty spicy. (I let it marinade like another reviewer said...but it was still too spicy.) The chicken was still very moist, which was great. I don't know if my chicken breasts were thicker but it took about 45 minutes to get them cooked through. I rate this a three since it was good for me...but we probably won't make it again since the rest of the house doesn't like so much heat!! Thanks though....

It was really good, but we added 1 tbsp of butter, and 1 roma tomato, 1/4 yellow onion, 1/2 lemon, and 1/2 jalapeño as the "fresh" salsa that got added to the canned salsa. We also added avocado as the finishing touch. We found this yummy dish to go great with Spanish rice!

Soo good! I used Herdez Hot Salsa and I love the heat. Perfect balance of cheese, taco seasoning and salsa. I had no idea I would like it this much. It's great tex-mex without the heavy, fatty sauces. Incredibly healthy and it doesn't skimp on the flavor. I will make this again, and again, and again! Thanks, Faye!

Everyone loved this chicken.  Even my husband who swears he doesn't "like" chicken!  It's one of the few he will eat.  Simple to make...I keep forgetting to add the cheese at the end.  It's still wonderful.

Very good. I misread the taco seasoning measurement and ended up using 2 tablespoons instead of teaspoons, but it turned out great. I'll definitely make this again.

My husband and I love this easy and very tasty meal.  It is very unique tasting so it gives a change to the normal chicken dinner.  We like it because it is so flavorful and also very juicy.  I like to accompany with mexican rice.

I used the taco mix recipe from this site and replaced the cheddar cheese with mozzarella.  I also was concerned about the chicken drying out so I covered with foil for the first 15 minutes.  Served with mexican rice II recipe, also from this site. For our taste buds this was okay, not great.

Very easy and so good!  Didn't have taco seasonings so i used fajita seasonings and it worked out well. I used homemade salsa and served with rice to soak up the extra juices. Will make this again. Thanks!

So simiple but so delicious. I was skeptical at first but it turned out delicious. Besides cutting the recipe in half, I changed nothing. Next time I might add some green onions or a bit more spices but it is definitly not needed.

A very nice entree with items I often have on hand.  I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and added black olives, and that was a good addition; we used a mild salsa (BF doesn't like picante), but even still, tasty and a dish that we'll have again.  Thanks for the submission!

This dish is better the next day because the taco seasoning has a chance to blend into the salsa. Not sure if I'll make again.

I loved this dish. My husband, who never eats chicken, loved it. I think next time I'd add some sliced black olives to the top to give it more of a chicken enchilada flair.

I LOVE this recipe,it is my new favorite  way to make chicken! The ONLY thing I do different is add some jarred jalapeno's on top of the salsa. The sour cream is also a must! I crave this chicken and will be making it tonight!

Great and easy recipe.  I followed the recipe and it turned out great very moist and tender.  I used reduced sodium taco seasoning and sprinkled it on both sides of the chicken and it was perfectly seasoned.  My family loved it --I wish I had made more than the 4 breasts.  There were definitely no leftovers!

This was excellent!  Made exactly as written, it was quick, easy, and tasty.  Taco seasoning is what gives it that "something" - this would be great w/rice and salad, a tasty but not too heavy meal. Thanks so much!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because of the simplicity of it.  The taste was good for maybe a quick weeknight dinner. Wish I had some sour cream to top it off. Easy enough for a supervised child to make.

This is excellent! I sliced 3 chicken breasts in half to reduce cooking time. I followed the recipe pretty much - used a bit of seasoned salt and taco seasoning from the "Taco seasoning 1" recipe from this site. I sprinkled it on and let stand for 1.5 hrs. I used X-sharp freshly shredded cheddar and a Medium salsa. Baked about 20 mins then added the cheese and baked about 7 more minutes. The chicken was juicy and just so yummy. I made a mix of corn, red peppers, green chili peppers and black beans w a touch of cumin. I also used the Spanish Rice II to complement the rest of the meal. Can't wait for tomorrow to finish the leftovers.

We love this recipe! It was really easy. I decided not to add the sour cream because my kids don't like it. We ate every last bite of this chicken! It's great!!

My husband and I really liked this dish. It is quick and easy to prepare after a day at work and is filling and very flavorful. Served with Spanish rice you will have a complete meal, and even the kids will like it, I am sure. Thanks for this good recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I was afraid it was going to be to spicy but it wasjust right.  My children all loved it.  I also used bone-in chicken and had no problems.  It was really delicious.

Coat with more taco seasoning for additional flavor.  Cook 20 minutes (25 was a bit much).

I am a single person and this recipe is easy to make and freeze and keep for later quick dinners. I also put a strip of bacon on the chicken before putting the salsa on. Gives a whole new flavor along with the seasonsings of the salsa and the taco seasoning. very very good

Way better than expected. I cooked three breasts, using about a half a jar of salsa, and half a package of Lawry's taco seasoning. Chicken came out moist and very tasty. Food Club's "Spanish Rice Medley" goes great with this. We omitted the sour cream and used reduced-fat shredded cheddar.

This was good.  My husband gave it a 3, I gave it a 4 and my brother in law a 5.  I did marinate the chicken in the taco seasoning with some water though.  But other than that, I did it just as stated.

Wow! This was amazingly easy AND tasty! I made my own seasoning mix to use instead of the taco seasoning as we don't cook with salt in our household, and it still turned out wonderfully. My husband loved it! I'm adding this to our meal rotation.

This was so easy and good. I used more seasoning than called for (about 1/2 a packet) and, as recommended by other readers, just put it in a plastic bag to coat the chicken. Simple, simple, simple and very tasty. The chicken would be great in fajitas, too.

This is very good. My husband really, really liked it, my daughter was eating it but I'm not sure how much she enjoyed it. I don't usually cook with direct measurements so it's always a little of this, some of that. I liked the combination of flavors, it will be interesting to taste different salsas. Thanks!

I was looking for quick dinner recipes and stumbled on to this one among others. The others were not as quick they claimed to be but this one...it was not only quick and easy but it was so delicious!  I used the all of the taco seasoning packet for 4 pieces of chicken and just used a whole jar of the salsa.  No measuring nothing.  This was a great recipe.  Thanks for posting something that allows me to eat and spend less time in the kitchen and more with my baby!

This is so amazingly easy and incredible tender and yummy. It is going into my files to be used again and again. I used Zadie's Mexican seasoning instead of taco seasoning. It seemed like a lot, but the flavor did not overwhelm the chicken like I thought it would.

This is hands down the best dish with chicken that I've ever made. I did the marinade thing, as a couple other chefs have suggested, and the breasts were juicy and flavorful. No more shriveled up breasts for me, at least not until I approach my twilight years, but that has nothing to do with cooking.

LOVED IT!!! Per others' suggestions, I marinated the chicken and the taco sauce with water, about 3/4 C, over night actually. Put 1/4 C of salsa over each piece, baking uncovered for about 30 minutes, topped with Mexican blend cheese (that's what I had) and served with seasoned black beans, garnished with sour cream. AWESOME!!!!

I marinated the chicken in the taco seasoning as well.  I served dinner with rice and the leftover chicken went into tortillas for the next day's lunch.

This is now a staple in our house. Changes made were I coated the taco seasoning on the chicken the night before, then I put it in the crock pot on high for 3 hrs. I used low fat sour cream and topped w/ sliced black olives. Sometimes I'll put a thin layer of beans under it and I usually serve it w/ mexicorn.

So moist and delicious.  My husband had seconds.  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours in the taco seasoning with about a half a cup of water.  From there, I followed the recipe exactly.  I turned out great with Mexican Corn and black beans as side dishes.

I marinated the chicken w/the taco seasoning, as someone have recommended. Used Mexican style cheese blend I had left over &  homemade salsa. I liked that it was quick/easy and I was able to use ingredients I had on hand. But I wouldn't say it was the best chicken. I would make it again just for the convenience.

Quick, easy, and delicious. The chicken was flavorful and moist.  I served black beans, brown rice and sliced avacodo on the side and got rave reviews from my family. This will become part of the rotation of our family favorites.

I made 2 great meals out of this.  For sake of time, I used canned shredded chicken and I put the chicken, seasoning and salsa in the crockpot and cooked it for a few hours.  I put it on tostadas and added the cheese and sour cream to it, along with some beans.  The next night, I made tacos out of it, used corn tortillas and added some avocado.  Awesome, easy recipe that can be so versatile.

We thought this was really good. I made it exactly as the recipe stated - could have let it sit in the taco seasoning a bit. Served it with Spanish rice and black beans - great Mexican meal. Quick and easy too!

I followed the recipe as it was, except I didnt measure the taco seasoning, I just sprinkled it on until I liked the way it looked. I made Spanish rice & corn with it. It was great; my husband loved it. It was so easy to make. This one will definately be a keeper.

This was absolutely amazing! I can't believe how much flavor came out of such a simple recipe! My husband can't stop talking about it. I followed some of the reviewer recommendations and marinated the chicken for about an hour, and I put a can of refried beans and about 1/3 of a chopped onion on the bottom of the pan.  I also poured most of the marinade on top of the chicken before putting on the salsa.  I served with spanish rice, but will try cornbread next time.  I will be making this very often.

Very easy...very good!  We love chicken, but the kids get burned out of chicken (about 4 nights a week) so we try to do something different each time...this was a success!  WE served it with corn and VIGO rice...

Good. Tastes like chicken with taco seasoning on it.  I have always done this when I use chicken for tacos insted of beef, and top with salsa and cheese in the taco shell.

OK, funny story about this recipe...  I was sick so my BF offered to make it since it was super easy.  I get home from work, go upstairs to change and he comes up 2 min later with a sad look on his face confessing he already "messed it up."  He cut the chicken into chunks and dumped all the taco seasoning on it.  At least he tried.  The chucks actually worked out (no cutting as we sat infront of the TV to watch a movie), but we did have to wipe off a lot of the seasoning.  We served it over brown rice and I think we might add kidney beans next time just to add some nutritional value.  Such a yummy quick and easy recipe.  Thank you so much!  We will def make this again (and read the directions).

I fixed this chicken dish for dinner tonight. It was so easy and really good. I served it with Spanish Rice. I let the chicken bake for 35 minutes before putting the cheese on top. My husband, sister-n-law and 3 year old niece thougt it was great. Thanks for sharing!:o)

Super easy, ingredients were on hand, followed recipe exactly, was a bit skeptical, but the whole family enjoyed it! great for those nights when have not thought out a dinner, served with saffron rice and salad, as reviewers recommended that Mexican rice was too overpowering! will certainly use again!

My picky family loved this!! I used mild seasoning and salsa(for the kids) and turned out great. The pickier kids just removed the salsa and still enjoyed the chicken. This is for sure a keeper.

VERY VERY VERY GOOD.  I used 1 cup of Pace Picante and 1/2 cup of Fresh Garden Gourmet Salsa (in refrig section).  Also used fat-free Kraft Cheddar Cheese.  VERY GOOD-THE BEST Kids loved it and so did husband.  Served refried beans on the side.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  The salsa made the chicken very tender.  I took the advice and made with the Mexican corn and a side of spanish rice.  It was super!  I plan to share this with my cooking group.

This is a GREAT recipe! So super quick and easy. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Moist and tender. I used a nacho/taco shredded cheese mix. The sour cream on top is a must. This will definitely become a staple recipe in my house. Thanks so much!

This was surprisingly good, considering the simpicity of it. I always prefer using this method (baked @350)for boneless chicken breasts (with various different coatings/toppings) because it comes out very moist. We forgot to use the sour cream until halfway through, and it was fine with or w/o. The only negative was, it was a little salty... probably from the salsa cooking down. Will try a low-sodium or different brand next time. Excellent for a weekday or even a company dinner! After reading reviews, I served with "Vigo" brand  saffron (yellow)rice and green beans. I agreed with the reviewer that said a non-spicy/Mexican side dish would pair better. Thank you for the great recipe!

I ended up not having any taco seasoning, so I seasoned it myself, but it was just as good! I also used some peach mango salsa, which added a different flavor that was fantastic. I will definitely be making this recipe again, because it was quick, easy, and delicious!

We had this for dinner last night. My husband said that this was probably his favorite baked chicken. The chicken was very juicy and had great flavor! I loved dipping it into some low fat sour cream. I served this with homemade Spanish rice, and cornbread. I think I'll be making this again very soon!

I made this for me and my husband and were left disappointed that we hadn't made more! It tasted wonderful and was easy to make. I even made it for my picky sister and although I put too much salsa on it for her liking she still enjoyed the dish. Will make over and over again.

Awesome stuff!!  I took others suggestions and poked small holes in the chicken then I used the plastic bag trick to coat it.  I also used a small baking dish so it wouldn't dry out.  I served the chicken with refried beans and spanish rice, everyone loved it!  This is a keeper!

Absolutely the best! I made this just for myself because the guys were having stromboli.  My youngest wanted this after tasting it instead of the stromboli.  I used Pace Picante mild, Taco Seasoning I from Bill from this site, minimal cheese and low-fat sour cream.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was GREAT!!!  And SO easy! I marinated the chicken in the taco seasoning and the salsa overnight and it had so much flavor - not overwhelming though - just perfect. We did add the sour cream as others recommended, but i think it would have been great as is too. We paired it with Mexican corn (nothing fancy, just out of the can) and this was just enough balance. Yummy! I will definitely make this again!!

Received also in my daily e-mail.. Quick & easy to make.. Great flavor!  Gave a twist to plain old chicken breasts.. Will definitely add to the rotation!

This recipe is great - easy, with hardly any clean up. I didn't have taco seasoning, so I just used come chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper flakes, and some garlic pepper. It had some kick, but you can manipulate the amount of spice. This will definitely be a staple in the rotation.

This is a great recipe- fast and easy. I cut the chicken in bite size pieces (to make two chicken breast feed three people) and served with refried beans. Very good!

Very good, I had about 1/4 cup of refried beans left over that I added to the salsa. It seemed to keep it place when cutting the chicken, might do that again.

I made this for dinner last evening and for a week night dinner this is great! So simple and fast and very good too! The only change I made was to add the crushed nacho chips on top of cheese. Really nice touch. My boyfriend's kids will love this. I made this with Mexican Rice from this site. They go great together. Also made a plate of warm nachos with cheese and salsa in micro for a special touch.  This is a keeper!

Tasty recipe! I shook the chicken and taco seasoning in a plastic bag as others suggested and it turned out very nicely flavored! Not too hot for me, and always easy to add hot sauce on top for the brave.

I really liked it but my wife thought it was OK. Maybe that was because I was in the mood for salsa and she wasn't. Anyway we will have this again.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  I used a spicier salsa than I normally use for chips and it came out perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!

This is an incredible recipe and so easy! We call them "naked fajitas: because we use fajita seasoning instead and add guacomole at the table.

I like this one, it's simple, tasty, fast and uses things I usually have on hand. Since I'm not all that great at planning ahead, that is really key to my recipe rotation. Tonight I'm going to try it using 'Taco Seasoning I' from this site...I bet it'll be even better than the packet.

This was so easy and so delicious. I tried it because I had all the ingredients on hand, and was pleasantly surprised! I served it with yellow rice. I think the trick is to use a salsa that you really love.

So a few things here. I used really big chicken breasts and while they were very juicy they were completly bland. All we tasted was chicken & sour cream, none of the salsa, cheese or seasoning. I even used 4 tbsp taco seasoning. So if you plan on using big chicken breasts, either add more taco seasoning or wait until you have smaller. I do plan on trying again using smaller ones. I figured it would turn out good with all of the good ratings and it sounds really good too.

So easy to make, you don't even really need the recipe!  Toss the chicken in a sealable bag with seasoning, add salsa, cook, add cheese, cook a little more.  It's all about personal preference.

Kids loved it ... husband not so much.  Very easy - which is always a plus.  Make extra ... cut up leftover chicken for a FABULOUS chicken salad the next day!

Quite good! Had to drain water twice but I did use homemade salsa, bought salsa may have less moisture. Actual cooking time was more like 35-45 minutes for me and last half was @ 400F. My breasts were quite thick though (the chicken) so that may have contributed. Family loved it!

Fabulous.  The chicken stayed very moist and was done perfectly.  I like how you can change up the salsa to suit your taste - from really hot picante to a flavorful mild salsa.  We served with Old El Paso Spanish rice.

Excellent!!!  I used a homemade salsa that I had leftovers of, and it has some kick to it; not sure how this would taste with jarred salsa, but the way I made it, was a huge hit with my husband and I.  Definitely a keeper recipe and didn't change a thing!!

Very Good!  Easy!  I actually forgot about adding the cheese and it was still good.  I served it with Southwestern Style Rice by Knorr Sides Plus.   Will definately make it again and share the recipe with others.

Wow!! We had absolutely no leftovers with this. I followed the recipe exactly and used a Chipotle blend cheese I found at the grocery store, it gave it just the right amount of kick!! Can't wait to make this one again and its super easy!!

Was ok, kind of bland. Not sure if I'll make this again, if I do I will put more of the seasoning on the chicken.

This won me accolades at dinner last night and I do like to give my guys what they like. I used the taco seasoning more as a rub and then used Muir Glen Fire-roasted tomatoes to cover. Better than awesome!

mmmmm!!!  So good and easy to make!  I used way more taco seasoning than the recipe said, as well as a whole jar of salsa and some chopped olives.  The salsa is great because it gives so much flavor and it is vegetables!

I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken cooked perfectly.  I sliced each breast in strips after done cooking.  It was moist and very flavorful.  Great with rice and warm tortillas. So quick and easy.  I will definately cook this again.

I can't believe how good this was, especially because it was SO EASY.  I always have the ingredients on hand, so I'm sure this will be a regular meal in my house.  I served it with corn and spanish rice.

So good! I didn't even follow the recipe, I just added seasonings and salsa to taste and it was delicious and easy. I mixed frozen corn with brown rice and a little Emeril's essence, put the salsa chicken on that, and topped with cheese and sour cream. Next time I'll try it with black beans mixed in the rice. It's good cold too, we ate it for lunch the next day!

This was amazing and sooo easy.  My husband doesn't care for chicken and he went back for seconds.  We had it for dinner last night and he was still raving about it this morning.  The one thing I did differently was cover the dish with foil before baking.

It really is as wonderful as people say. The chicken comes out very moist. I used reduced fat everything to make it even more healthy-friendly.

This is a good way to spice up boneless skinless chicken breast. It is also easily adaptable to be Weight Watchers friendly!

Excellent and so easy!  I used Medium salsa and it definitely had some bite to it.  My husband loved in and he normally doesn't care too much for chicken.

this was good, though I think the salsa you use on top makes a big difference, since that's where you are getting a good percentage of your flavor from.  We used COstco's 'Jacks Special Salsa' which was just perfect.

I don't cook very often.  I had some family over for dinner and made this.  This was so easy to make and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe to feed everyone.  There were no leftovers and even my picky sister ate it.

I used the RoTel tomatoes and the taco seasoning. I let the chicken sit in a ziploc bag with the taco seasoning for a bit then I cooked it with the RoTel tomatoes. It turned out so juicy, I almost cried (I was really hungry). I give it five stars but a warning:  my children did not like it b/c it was spicy but since I served it with rice, mexican corn and salad they just dipped the chicken in the dressing and they liked it that way.

This tastes great and is so easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand.  The perfect thing to make when you haven't given much thought to dinner but want something that tastes great.  Not to mention it's healthy.  Go easy on the cheese and it's a great option for anyone on Weight Watchers.  This is one of the few dishes that hubby and all three (picky) kids will eat.  That makes this a definite keeper.

Fabulous!  I made slight changes which were: 2 pkgs of taco seasoning mix placed into a large ziplock bag. I rinsed chicken, shook off excess water then placed one breast at a time in the bag and shook to coat the chicken.  Shake off excess seasoning.  I used 2 cups of salsa and a bit more cheddar cheese.  Absolutely a keeper!!  My husband, who is not a particular fan of sour cream said that the sour cream was an absolute must with this recipe.  Perfect blend of flavors.  
As another member had done, I made the Best Black Beans to go with this.  Slight changes on that recipe were I used 1/2 tsp Cumin instead of the Cilantro and I added 2 tsp of lime juice.  (Other ingredients I used per recipe.) Brought everything to a boil, then covered the pan and simmered on low for 20 mins.  I served the beans over Mahatma (brand) yellow rice which I cooked in the microwave.  A wonderful dinner!!!

Yum! Used home-made salsa, and I think it makes all the difference.  The chicken is so moist!  I served this with "Best Black Beans" on this site, and dinner was a hit!  I will be making this again soon!

This was a great chicken dish.  Super easy and fast.  I would add more taco seasoning the next time, just for more flavour.  I also added some more shredded cheese after I brought it out of the oven.  Serve it with rice and a salad, and you have a great meal.

This is the best. I did use the taco seasoning off this site. I think it made the recipe. It will become one of our favorites. I did cut our chicken to make them thinner. And I did use all of the taco seasoning mix. I didn't cook as long as they were thinner. Also used alum to cover. Thank you for the recipe.

I wasnt crazy about the way this came out.  I read a lot of the reviews before I made it and still thought that I would enjoy it.  I guess I shouldve expected it taste like tacos, but the taco flavoring was just too overwhelming.  It was ok, but I definetly wont make it again.

This was an excellent recipe.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and used the extra sauce as an appetizer with tortilla chips.  Then I served over pasta noodles.  This is a great dish.  The family loved it!

I'm an almost six month newlywed who is trying desperately to learn to cook. I am always a wreck after work attempting to find something to whip up in a hurry. This recipe was PERFECT. I had everything on hand and my husband loved it. Served with spanish rice and shoepeg corn, the meal was an absolute winner.

I made this chicken for dinner last night and neither my DH or I were thrilled with it.  I felt that 1 tsp of taco seasoning was too much for each breast and the flavour of the cheese was lost amongst the bold flavours of teh salsa and taco seasoning.  In the end, the dish wasn't offensive, it was just a little on the boring side (but I guess what did we expect with a 5 ingredient recipe!)

Very very tasty! My husband and mother-in-law were as surprised as I was at how juicy the chicken was, and how great the salsa with cheese and sour cream was as a sauce. I served it with black beans, spanish rice, and warm tortillas and there were NO leftovers! :)

WE THOUGHT THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT! THE INGREDIENTS SEEMED LIKE A LITTLE MUCH, SO I USED LESS OF THEM. I SPRINKLED THE TACO SEASONING ON AND SPOONED THE SALSA ON THE CHICKEN. WORKED OUT GREAT. EVEN MY 4 YEAR OLD ASKED FOR SECONDS. THANKS FOR A QUICK AND EASY RECIPE.

this was truly an easy recipe!  i changed it just a bit and got a can of green enchilada sauce and chopped onion and mixed it with the salsa and baked the chicken in that covered in the cheese.  wow!  it was really good with the enchilada sauce and onion!  the cheese and sour cream made it fantastic.  i made 11 pieces of chicken and they were all eaten!  served with just white boil in the bag rice and black beans from a can mixed together.  i had enough extra sauce to pour over the rice!  it was a hit with our dinner guests!!

this was surprisingly good!  the chicken came out real juicy and the flavor was great!  I actually used a non-chunky, very spicy fire-roasted red salsa and crumbled cotija and sharp cheddar cheese on top.  We cut up some avocados and made chunky guacamole and rice & beans for sides.  It was a fantastic meal!  Thanks much

Great for a quick, easy meal with a very few ingredients.  For a little less spice, leave off the taco mix.

I thought this recipe was terrific: it was easy, inexpensive and delicious! Very tender and juicy also. I added mushrooms on top of the salsa for a little extra flavor/texture, and baked it per directions. Yummy!

My four year old made this and it was great!  That proves that you really can't go wrong with this one.  We cooked it covered and served the juice over spanish rice.  A sprinkling of fresh chopped green onion added eye appeal as well as a nice flavor.  Try it!

Everyone really enjoyed this recipe, except DH.  There are 5 of us, so ea person gets a vote, therefore only 4 stars.  We especially like using the chicken as a filling for chicken burritoes, add some sour cream, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, olives, refried beans and a touch of guacamole - yum. Very, very filling.

Yummy! Quick go to meal,with only a few ingredients. Had this with the Spanish rice II from this site. Flour tortillas went great this as well. Nice use of taco seasoning besides using it on ground beef all the time.

We give this somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  Although I really wanted to love it (b/c of it's ease and common ingredients) we only thought it was okay.  Definitely go with the "fresh" salsa in the refrigerator section over the jarred stuff.  Maybe we did not love it b/c we live in San Antonio and get great Mexican food on a daily basis?  Probably won't make it again...but was really hoping to love it.

Great!! Busy moms must try this.  Next time I would pound the chicken a little (to 3/4 inch).  Definitely use a good salsa-look in the refrigerated section for a specialty salsa that is more like homemade-worth the extra money for the fresh flavors of cilantro and tomatoes (I used "Jack's").

Very good... must use a good quality salsa or make your own.  I put sour cream in a squeeze bottle and drizzled over the top of the chicken.  Very nice presentation.

This was very good and incredibly easy to make!  I scaled the recipe down to two servings and added an extra half teaspoon of taco seasoning and used peach salsa.  I marinated the chicken overnight and then added some olives to the cheese on top.  Yum, I'll definitely make this again!

Yumm - so easy and great! I have spent so much more time in the kitchen and not had something as tasty. Made two smaller pans- spicy for us and mild for the kiddos - also added sliced black olives. Loved it!! Served with black beans, and flour tortillas. Use a good salsa for best results. Thanks!

My husband made this... it was very easy and tasty. Nothing fancy, but good. We served it with black beans and a green salad. Next time I may saute up some onions and peppers fajita style to go with.

Super easy, super fast to prepare and very tasty.  I didn't measure.  We like extra seasoning so I just sprinkled the taco seasoning on both sides of the chicken and smothered it with salsa and cheese.  All three kids loved it.

My husband wasn't excited about the recipe - until he tried it!  We thought it tasted like chicken enchiladas minus the tortillas.  Great idea for low-carb menu.  Sour cream is the crowning glory - don't forget this finishing touch.  Yum!

incredibly simple, amazingly good. I skipped the taco seasoning and instead sliced some garlic and sprinkled with some chili powder (we like spicy food). I also used boneless chicken thighs instead - they came out tender and absolutely wonderful. We even dipped our tortillas in the chicken juices ...yummy!

This recipe hardly needs more reviews, but I'm adding mine because it has become such a family and company favorite at our house.  So easy, foolproof and delicious.  I often serve it with a Black Bean and Corn Salad, and it's like eating at an upscale Mexican restaurant. This is one of the best recipes on this site, proving that great food doesn't have to be complicated.

This is simply the easiest, yet tastiest chicken recipe I have made to date...It goes to show that good food doesn't have to take a lot of prep work or fancy ingredients to be fabulous!  I love salsa and I am always looking for new ways to incorporate it in my recipes!  I topped it off with some sliced black olives and sliced jalapeño peppers to kick it up a notch!  I served the chicken with some Spanish rice and no-fat refried beans!  It is a healthy, low fat dinner, and unless you tell…no one will ever know!

This recipe is FABULOUS as written.  I read many of the reviews and decided not to change anything but I did add chopped black olives under the cheese at the end.  Used Taco Bell Thick 'n Chunky Medium Salsa.  Topped with the sour cream as recommended.  Dee-lish!!

I did not have any taco seasoning so I followed anothers advice and used cumin, chile powder,I used too much cayenne, and I aslo used paprika.  I think the choice of your salsa plays a pick part in how it comes out.  It's one of those, why-didn't-I-think-of-that kind of  recipes?  Thanks for sharing!  It's GREAT!

I'm not a master chef by any means, however this was very quick, easy and tasted great! The salsa kept the chicken from drying out.  I served it with refried beans and Spanish rice :-). Yum!

Wow! Very easy and super quick to make!  I added 2 small chopped tomatoes to salsa and a dash of hot sauce to spice it up.  Smelled great, looked yummy and tasted delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

This is very easy. If you are looking for a quick dinner this fits the bill. The only change we made is to use velveeta instead of cheddar b/c it is all we had in the fridge, turned out well.

This recipe is so easy and yummy! The zesty flavor and the fact that the few ingredients are the kind most people have on hand already make it a great meal for a quick throw-together. I used a woody mesquite-type salsa and it was delicious. Goes well with a side of black beans and rice. Definitely a dish I will use again and again.

This recipe for salsa chicken is so easy and delicious! The chicken turned out really tender due to being immersed in salsa and the cheese added some creaminess to this yummy dish!

It took longer to pre heat the oven than to prepare.  It was very easy and quick.  We keep these things around so we can still eat when we dont have much time.  It was very tasty.  I usually have to cook my chicken for about 40 minutes, but that is just my oven.

First of all, the SMELL of this cooking in the oven is SOOOO GOOD!!!!!  We are eating more healthy these days so I used low fat monzorella cheese instead of cheddar.  It was REALLY good.  I used mild salsa, and it STILL was pretty warm & tangy.  My husband LOVED it.  It was super easy and tasty.  I would recommend to anyone who likes salsa! (I didn't add the sour cream this time but I might try it next time).

Quick and easy.  If you like mexican and love salsa you will enjoy this dish.  I think the taco seasoning rubbed on the chicken breasts makes this recipie better than similar ones I have tried.

Just OK.  My husband liked it, but I thought the chicken tasted kind of bland.  Maybe it needs to marinate in the salsa?

I gave this 5 *'s because it's extremely simple, very quick and taste good.  It's not awesome but it is by far one of the quickest entree's.  I used green chili salsa but next time I'll try a red salsa.  I served it with refried beans and corn and it was a good combination.

This has become a favorite in my house. Everytime I have chicken out my boyfriend requests this recipe. The chicken always comes out juicy from the juices of the salsa. Great recipe! We serve over white rice and always add extra salsa to the dish.

This definitely doesn't have an authentic Mexican taste as some of the reviewers have noted... You can tell just by looking at the list of ingredients (although Faye didn't claim and I wasn't expecting for it to have). However, I do agree that this recipe is very simple and tasty.

I have made this several times, and everyone always loves it. I use original old el paso taco seasoning (I've tried other seasoning, but this is the one that I think is the best) and lots of cheese (cheddar and mozzerella with garlic). I've also found that I like the thin cut chicken breasts better than the thick ones...not sure why, but the thin ones definetly are more liked in my house. Enjoy!

Easy way to get great, juicy chicken!  I love this recipe.  I even skip the seasonings part- no need to add sodium. :)

Very good and sooo easy.  I used mild salsa (I'm a wimp with spicy foods) and it was just a tad spicy, lol.  Followed recipe exactly, but didn't use as much cheese or the sour cream.  Will make again.

This is the easiest chicken dinner yet!  And very good!  Everyone thought I must have worked so hard on it! I did add some cayanne pepper to the chicken and did not need the sour cream.  Definately will make again!

This was excellent!! Couldn't be simpler and it's so versatile too.  You could use lots of different salsa flavors for a different taste each time.  I used a picante lime medium hot (Trader Joe's).  The flavor was awesome and the chicken was tender.  Everyone raved.  Will make again!!

It took less than 5 minutes preparation and tasted like I had spent hours slaving over a hot stove.  It was great as it was but next time I would increase the cheese (because I like the taste of cheese).  The sour cream added a touch of luxury to the taste.  I served it with Mexican rice and green salad

We just did not care for this. Maybe it was the salsa that we used. Being from Texas maybe we are spoiled on our Tex-Mex tastes. If we ever try this again with a different salsa I will re-rate if better.

Just like a famous television chef would say, it's easy peasy!  I kept the chicken sitting in the taco seasoning in a baggie in the fridge for several hours before baking.  It was the wonderful accompaniment to my favourite Mexican rice.

I'd make it 3.5 if I could...it was good, and I'd probably make it again b/c it was fast and easy.  Different salsas may help it out, but to me and my roommates this was "good" but nothing special.  Okay for a quick dinner though!  I served it with "Daddy's Fried Corn & Onions" from this site.

This was a very easy & quick recipe. I did not exactly measure out the taco seasoning & may have put too much because it was very strong - needed something else.  I'll try it again & measure the seasoning next time. A friend has tried this recipe & makes it almost every week - they love it. Thanks for sharing!!

This is awesome!  I use a little bit more of the taco seasoning, just kind of eyeing it, and about 3X the salsa and cheese.  I serve it with chips!  My family loves it!  Thank you so much!  ***Three days later--We had a recipe contest at work and I submitted this.  It won!!!!!  THANK YOU, FAYE!

This was wonderful! Made it for dinner last night and my boyfriend and I loved it.  I used a whole packet of taco seasoning and coated 6 pieces of chicken, laid them in the 9X13 and poured a mixture of medium salsa with mild picante sauce all over the chicken.  Topped with Cheddar cheese until all bubbly.  Served with spanish rice and steamed veggies!  Wonderful dinner and this will become a staple in my recipe book!  Easy and delicious!

This was a very tasty dish that was easy to prepare.  We had it with black beans and yellow rice.  Even my picky 6 year old ate it up!

We had this for dinner tonight and it was DELICIOUS. The chicken was moist and flavorful. It took me a grand total of 5 minutes to get this dish ready for the oven. The Boy said to give this recipe 20 stars. Thanks so much Faye!

My husband and 3 year old both liked this a lot. I didn't try it myself because I'm pregnant and can't bring myself to eat chicken right now.  :)  Easy to make and a nice change to baked chicken.

I got overwhelming "mmmmm's" from my husband and 11-year-old son. This was as easy to prepare as it was delicious. I served it with a side of black beans and warm tortillas and it made a great meal.

i tried this recipe once before, preparing it as directed. it turned out ok...but nothing amazing. tonight i made it slightly different and it turned out great! i used thin sliced chicken breasts, and pico de gallo (fresh salsa) instead of the kind sold in a jar (such as pace). i dumped almost the entire container on the 5 pieces of chicken, threw them in the oven and cooked them until white. i then shreaded cheddar cheese on top and put back in the oven for about 3 minutes. last, i topped it w/ fat free sour cream. it turned out so good and it couldn't be easier! it was much fresher tasting than the last time.

I cook the chicken and and then shred it first. Then i add the salsa, taco seasoning and cheese and cook it for another 10 minutes or so. Then i use it as a burrito filling and it is great. I usually don't measure the seasoning but i add a little at a time and then taste it. Serve with Mexican Rice, avacado, tomato in a flour tortilla and it tastes fabulous.

I rated this four stars because it was SO EASY! I wouldn't rave and say it is the best meal ever, but it was good and I would make it again.  Next time I will flatten out the chicken breasts, they were a little too thick. I also made a side of spanish rice and black beans to go along with it.

My husband and I thought this recipe was great! My chicken always turns out too dry and the salsa made the chicken so moist!!! I made spanish rice to go with it and didn't even need to use sour cream. I will definatly be making this one again and again!

My lovely friend Elizabeth made this for a mid-week dinner for friends.  (Hi Elizabeth!)  What a tasty, juicy and healthy dish!.  With a Mexi-Cali themed tossed salad and fresh tortillas it made an impressive company meal (especially for a weeknight)   It is now in my recipe box and ready for when I have to quickly bring together a wonderful meal.   THANKS FAYE!

What a wonderful, easy recipe to make.  I have made this recipe many times at home and for potluck lunches at work.  Everyone raved about it.  I especially like the fact that diabetics and people who want to lose weight (I use low-fat sour cream) can eat this without worrying about how it will effect their diet.  When I am working, I really need recipes that are as easy as this and that have flavor and are not bland.

My goodness!!  This was the best chicken recipe I have tried in a long time.  I used chicken taco seasoning which has a slightly different taste from regular taco seasoning and it was fabulous...I can't say enough.  Will be making this a lot.

Oh my gosh, if I could give this recipe TEN stars I would!  Who knew something soooo simple and quick could be so darn delicious? I used half a packet of taco seasoning which we thought was perfect.  I also used a little more than a cup of Picante mild salsa.  And of course we added extra cheese. Can you ever have too much cheese?:-) This is a new regular recipe around our house. It's beautiful when it comes out of the oven, smells heavenly while cooking, and will impress your guests or your family.  Happy cooking!:-) EDIT: STILL delicious! I LOVE this recipe!

Great recipe! Even my 6 yr old son raved for this one! The salsa was the perfect flavoring, although I added more cheese just because we really like cheese. My husband enjoyed the leftover sauce mixture with his chips later. There literally were no left overs. I use salsa in my meat loaf too...something about salsa that just adds the right amount of everything needed.

I really liked this dish!  A lot of flavor.  I forgot sour cream, but it really didn't matter.  It was delicious anyway.  My husband only thought it was okay, but that is because he is not a fan of salsa.

This recipe was awesome. I made it at my mother-in-laws house and we all loved it.
we did add mozzerella cheese with it.
But we loved it very quick and easy to make.

Super easy, good flavor and the salsa kept the chicken very moist. Good for those nights where you have no idea what you are going to have for dinner!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe and I probably won't make it again.  I'm not sure if it was because I didn't like the salsa that I used or something else.  The chicken was moist, but it didn't suit my taste buds.

Didn't have any breats so I used thighs and increased the baking time. They were very moist. My 2 year old barely stopped to breathe between bites.

Wonderful!  Very simple and one of our favorites.  I serve the chicken breast on a bed of rice using the Mexican Rice II recipe also found on this website.

This really was good. I think next time I will pound the chicken a little so that it is thin, or maybe use chicken tenders. I loved the sour cream on it.YUM!

Yum!  This was so good, my husband said it was the best chicken I have ever made.  I used Herdez salsa (our personal favorite).  I also used a whole packet of taco seasoning.  I used light sour cream on top.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and easy to prepare.  I used Chicken taco seasoning mix instead because it was what I had.  We like spicey so I used the entire package instead of only 4 teaspoons and just coated both sides of the chicken with it.  Will definately make again!

YUMMY!! The ohnly change I made was to not put the taco seasoning on the chicken because I didn't want it too spicy for my kids to eat. Very good!! I served it with the "Best Spanish Rice" recipe from this website. Tasty!

Amazingly easy to make, healthy and delicious.  My entire family loves this dish.  I'm sure it is destined to become a regular around here.  We used a chunky salsa with corn and bean in it.  Yummy!

Very good and tasty. Different, too, which is a nice change from the everyday chicken dish. The only thing I changed was I used the Mexican-blend cheese and it was great. One of our new favorites.

This recipe was excellent.  My husband and I loved it.  Just the right amount of spice and the chicken was very moist.  I will definitely be making this again!
