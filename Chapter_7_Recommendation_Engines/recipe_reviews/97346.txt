Tastes great. The recipe, however, leaves out where to add a third of the ingredients! My amended Step 3 is:

Stir the texturized vegetable protein and vegetable flake mixture in with the mushroom and onions. Mix bread crumbs, pepper, sea salt, thyme, savory, cloves and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add bread crumb mixture into vegetable mixture. Pour the beer into the skillet with the vegetable mixture; remove from heat and cool. 

I used 1/4 tsp marjoram and 1/4 tsp sage instead of savory. I also used a frozen pie crust and only used 2/3 of the filling inside the pie. 

Fantastic with cranberry chutney!!

I was given a box of beef-style TVP and was floundering around looking for something to make. This recipe was very, very good. Beware! Most refrigerated pie crusts contain lard. Mrs. Smith's is the only brand I've found that doesn't.

I'm not vegetarian, but I do eat vegetarian meals once in a while.  I have to admit though, this vegetarian tourtiere leaves something to be desired.  I always wanted to find an excuse to try TVP, but never could find a use for it.  Having tried it, however, I don't think I'll be eagerly awaiting another opportunity.  Looks like ground meat, but tastes... uh, unique.  To make matters worse, half the recipe instructions are missing.  Thanks Jkalea for your step 3!

The disjointed instructions are a bit hard to follow, but the end result is very delicious!

This is a good recipe despite the fact that it is a little disjointed.  My niece is vegetarian and I am always looking for something to cook for her when she comes over.  The beer you choose does make a big difference, I went with  heavy winter lager  very distinct taste.  I will make it again with a different beer.

Tried this dish and was not pleased.  The taste left little to be desired and the directions were very disjointed.
