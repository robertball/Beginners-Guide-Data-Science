11.19.17  I started out in my large skillet, but after adding the water and tomato juice to the skillet, it was so full that I decided to just switch to my dutch oven before adding the rest of the ingredients (next time I’ll start in the dutch oven).  This does take an hour to cook, but you have only one pan to clean, it just couldn’t be simpler to make, and all ingredients are ones that I always have on hand.  Made exactly as written, tasted, and then adjusted to our personal taste by adding some sriracha and basil.  Nothing fancy here, but this is a solid weeknight meal that really does taste good.  Simply served with salad and some garlic bread which I made from a ciabatta roll.
