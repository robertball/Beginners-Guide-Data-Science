These were great. I used pastry whole wheat flour, and to cut calories I used half the sugar, and half the butter. They worked ou great and they were very easy.

These were good - but nothing spectacular - they were better right out of the oven, after that they are dry tasting.

I used what I had on hand and ended up with the following substitutions: splenda not sugar, margarine not butter, skim milk, a dash of nutmeg, and a drop of almond extract.  I also added some dried cranberries in some of them.  The cranberry cookies weren't bad - I really wish I had added them to all of the cookies.  They were a little dry overall and pretty simple/bland tasting but puffy and light.  Maybe some kind of gooey frosting would do the trick.  They needed to be pressed down as they stayed in balls when they cooked.

These are really good. We pulled them out a little earlier, flattened the tops with a spoon and sprinkled sugar over them. YUM!

Yummy!  I substituted the sugar for splenda and used margarine instead of butter since it was all I had.  I also  added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the recipe.  These turned out not too sweet and very moist.

Great recipe, with a good flavor. A pleasure to eat and a treat to make! Very quick to make, would be a good children's recipe.  I put 1/2 the sugar in and still found them sweet.

I noticed just about everyone who rated this recipe, had altered it.   It's a great recipe as is and a great base cookie recipe to begin with and add whatever else your tummy desires!!!!

These were great.  I added chocolate chunks, but I don't know exactly how much.  I just eyeballed it.  The cookies were fluffy and not to sweet.  My boyfriend did not even mind that I had used whole wheat flour.  These are worth a try!

I made a half batch because they were just for myself. I made a few changes to the recipe to make them more healthy. I used a mix of brown and white sugar for flavor, I used 1 tbsp of almond milk, milled flax seed, sun flower seeds, and 1/2 tsp of olive oil to moisten it a bit. I added nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon. I used a 1 inch disher to scoop the batter, I got 27 cookies out of a half batch. These were good, I really like the flavor of the whole wheat flour and they weren't overly sweet.

Nice mild flavour; not too sweet and perfect with a cup of coffee or tea! They baked a bit crumbly, but tasty anyway. I made a batch to put some on a Christmas cookie tray for a family with a diabetic mom, so I substituted the sugar with Splenda with no trouble.

I made these as a new way to use whole wheat flour.  I made them exactly as shown and both my husband and I really liked them.  I plan to add chocolate chips to the next batch.   I believe that if you want a less sweet cookie you need to reduce the amount of sugar.
