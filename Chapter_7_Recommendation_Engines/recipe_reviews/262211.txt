I loved this! It makes a ton, which is great, because it lasts a long time. I have a big ol' sauerkraut crock that I used to let it ferment for the first night, before transferring it into two big containers for the fridge. I used the slicing blade on my Cuisinart for the cabbage and the shredder for the beet and carrot, so it wasn't an overwhelming prep chore, either. It makes about a gallon; we ate it up over the course of a month. Oh--I omitted the vegetable oil. Sometimes I drizzled good olive oil over my portion, sometimes I didn't. The picture is of one last ramekin of salad! Time to make more.
