I made this with an oreo crust and crushed oreos mixed in the second layer, then I cut oreos in half for the top.  This got great reviews from our dinner guests.  It was smooth, creamy and very chocolatey!

I used sugar free pudding and fat free milk. It was good. Very rich though. I used a regular graham gracker crust. Will make again.
