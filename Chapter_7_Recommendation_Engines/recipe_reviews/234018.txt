I'm a huge cretons addict, having be raised on it in my French Canadian family. I always love trying different variations. This was definitely a huge change for me as I'd never tried making them "healthier" using turkey...and you know what, I bet you could trick someone into thinking it was pork just on flavor alone. The texture was a little off, since gelatin is the binder instead of fat and bread. I wasn't a huge fan of this since it ended up very firm and hard to spread. But, that said, I think you could use less gelatin, and/or bring the cretons to room temp before serving. The one major thing I suggest is to add salt! It will be way too bland without. Try 1 tsp to really bring out the flavors. I always eat this the traditional way...on toast with yellow mustard. Yum!
