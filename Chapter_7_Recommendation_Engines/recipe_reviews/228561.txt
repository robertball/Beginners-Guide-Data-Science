I  love this stuff - have not made it but want to.  I wanted to share a helpful tip for making the crushed peppermint candy easier.   Save the inner sack/liner of your next box of cereal or crackers.  The flexible bag that is so hard to open most of the time.  It is perfect for pounding almost anything and doesn't break, tear or leak.  Then you just throw it away once you're finished.  I've used them for years and especially like how it holds up when I'm pounding boneless chicken breasts to flatten them.  So try this easy tip and happy holiday cooking to all!

Have been making this for years and great for gifts and bazaars.  An easy project for Scouts, Sunday School, or classroom use.  Try using hard mint discs in red or green or multi-colored candy canes.  Can use almond bark coating instead of white chocolate chips.

I've been making this candy every year for Christmas and we love it.  Not only you can make it with peppermint candy, you can add pretzels with salted peanuts or you can add chinese noodle with salted peanuts in white chocolate or almond bark.  They all very good.

Couldn't be easier.  I make this at Christmas and have just winged the proportions in the past.  I normally use a little more candy cane than this.  It works equally well with the almond bark they sell in bigger packages too.  If you plan to make a bigger batch, it's more economical.

I have tried this receipe several times. I used chocolate chips the first time. It was just okay. I decided to try the Amond Bark. I loved the white almond bark the best. I quadrupled the recipe, 24 ounces of Almond Bark to 12 regular sized peppermint sticks. I prefer to crush the peppermint sticks very well otherwise they stick in your teeth. I put in a jelly roll pan and chilled for 1 hour. YUMMO! This makes a more chunkier bark, which I loved. I have even done the Chocolate Bark,  White Almond bark and even did a layer of chocolate bark, chilled for an hour, a layer of White Almond bark on top, chilled for another hour. It was good but the White Almond bark is my families favorite. I even told a friend about this recipe and she made it  for her family this Christmas. They loved it too. It's easy and cheap and tastes like store bought. Merry Christmas!

I've made this many, many times. I just vary one little detail. I like to add the candy on top after the melted chocolate has been spred out onto wax paper. The colors look so much more festive when you can see them! I gently and carefully press them into the chocolate with my hand but you can still see the colors of the candy canes. I hope you and your family enjoy making this as much as we do!

This is as easy as it gets - and yet so tasty and delicious! Super creamy and the peppermint flavor goes so well with the white chocolate. This is my son's favorite Christmas treat and is on the "to make" list each Holiday season. I like to smash the peppermint pieces pretty (leaving a few larger pieces) to really infuse the flavor throughout the white chocolate. I use a 12-oz package of white chocolate chips and about 30 pieces of round peppermint candies, crushed.

Been making this for years with white almond bark. I love it, the family loves it, and it's SUPER easy!!!! I use a whole package of bark and a box (12, I think) of candy canes, though sometimes I add more because I like it really minty.

Easy! Made this last Christmas for the first time and have made more complicated recipes in the past. This was quick, easy, and just as tasty as the more time consuming ones! Thanks Morgan.

Can't get much simpler than this.  I crushed candy canes (in an empty cereal bag I had saved for such use) and set aside a little to sprinkle over the top then mixed the rest into the white chocolate.  Came out tasty and attractive.

Yum. My son's girlfriend only likes white chocolate so I made this for her. She loved it! I used almond bark and added a bit of mint extract. Easy and very good.

I love peppermint for Christmas, so I knew I would like this.  Very simple to make, and quick too.  I did add a tablespoon of shortening to the chocolate while melting as others did and had no problems with melting.  I will make this again at Christmas time.

I have made this before, but had used another recipe, which was not nearly as easy!  This is so easy and so delicious, don't expect it to last very long! Make a double or triple batch!!

Super easy!  I did put a few drops of peppermint extract in it to beef up the flavor.  Sprinkled additional peppermints on top.  Gordon's Food Service has pre-crushed peppermints.  I know it is easy to do it yourself, but these are crushed to the same consistency.  I liked that part.

yum!  I used 8 oz of melted vanilla candy coating mixed with 12 small candy canes that were crushed to almost a powder, then pressed 6 coarsely-chopped small candy canes onto the top of the mixture.  My 13 year-old step-son and I enjoyed making this together!

So easy to make.  However, this amount makes a very small batch.  I bought  24oz of Vanilla Bark to make it for small gifts.  I also added a small amount of Almond Extract also.  I stirred in the crushed peppermint and then also sprinkled some on top.

This is a very easy recipe and a great gift to give to neighbors, teachers etc. I made this twice and the second time I add about a 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract and a couple more candy canes per batch. Between the two batches, I preferred the one with the added extract and extra  candy canes.

So Easy and SO YUMMY!  If you need a quick and easy candy for a gathering or present, this is the one.  My special needs 3 year old and my 9 year old boys were able to help me make this with minimal help.  I did have to hide them afterward because they kept sneaking pieces when I wasn't looking.

Simple and effective receipe.  I do tend to make a double batch (at least) because this won't make an abundant amount.  I usually make it when I'm making Christmas cookies and want some for each platter of assorted cookies I may have/give away.  

I also prefer peppermint MUCH more than white chocolate, so I like to use 5 candy canes per 2oz white chocolate, whereas the recipe calls for 3 candy canes per 2oz.  This is just my own preference of masking some of the white chocolate sweetness.

Absolutely delicious! I microwaved mine for about five minutes on melt, and it turned out fine.  The only  other change I made was adding about  1/4 cup more crushed candy cane, because I like mine minty, and I sprinkled some on top. I made it for a thank you gift and we LOVED it! Super easy and tasty.

Easy recipe. I added more crushed candy cane on top for more color but other than that it was so easy!

Because I burnt the first batch of white chocolate, I ended up using my double broiler which worked great!! After the white chocolate was spread out, I also sprinkled some crushed candies and put it on the top of the melted  white chocolate as someone suggested, and it really turned out pretty!

Had to come up with a quick snack for a potluck at work... not much simpler than this! Made an extra batch to keep for home.
