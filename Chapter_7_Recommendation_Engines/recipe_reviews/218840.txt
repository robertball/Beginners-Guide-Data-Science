I'm giving it a 4.  It gets a 5 star for the simplicity of it, but taste wise it's on a 3.  The spaghetti sauce I used was Bertolli fire roasted cabernet sauvignon, and it gave it some flavour, but I prefer a homemade sauce.

Scaled this down to half a recipe, used fresh oregano and parsley which I had on hand, and my own marinara sauce (which is always in the freezer).  I wanted to eat it the day it was prepared, so I did cook the noodles, and baked for about 40 minutes.  This turned out well, and I would make it again.

We all thoroughly enjoyed this. The sausage was a bit overwhelming but that was my only issue with it. Next time we'll use 1/2 sausage and 1/2 beef. We also used Johnsonville ground sausage instead of the links (personal preference.) Quick and easy dinner!

When I sauteed the sausage, I threw in a chopped onion and a good amount fresh minced garlic. I also added italian seasoning to the sauce. I chose to use "trim" cottage cheese instead of ricotta but I added 1/3 cup of Kraft parmesan cheese to thicken it up a bit (cottage cheese is quite a bit runnier than ricotta). I did also use a few more lasagna noodles in this recipe. Very simple lasagna recipe that was easy on the wallet. All three of my men had seconds.

I made this last night and my family enjoyed it.
Instead of Hot sausage I used Johnsonvilles Sweet Italian Sausage which gave it a really nice flavor and I used Ragu's galic and onion sauce. Boiled the noodles first and then put together and started cooking right away instead of refrigerating 8hrs.
Will definitely make this again!!! 2dachsielover
