Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe! Mine didn't spread out much, so I wonder if substituting butter-flavored shortening would make them flat like regular chocolate chip cookies and not a clump like mine turned out). The taste was outstanding.  When I made them for a staff meeting, everyone had difficulty trying to stop eating them, and one guy got a stomach ache from eating so many!  I would say these are the ultimate chocolate chip cookie!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

OK...seriously...Barb, could you be any more of a genius?  This recipe was to DIE for.  These cookies were hard to stop eating.  Ask my husband.  Hubby ate the whole  tin full before I could offer any of my friends one.  Hmmm... A true husband pleaser.  I also got whatever I wanted after making these cookies for him. He even cleaned out the garage.  Nice!  Thanks Barb.

Good cookies!  My husband enjoyed them.  To lower fat and calories I used margarine; half the amount of milk chocolate chips; have the amount of nuts (used walnuts) and toasted them then ground them.  Without these changes cookies would be even better!  Will make again.

Mixed reviews again from our house.  I tried one, then reserved my review until Hubs was able to try one too and offer his review, which I fully expected would be different than mine. It's an attractive enough cookie, and I appreciate that  they baked up to a nice thickness - not flat, but not cakey poofs either. As I do with all cookie doughs made with butter, I chilled the dough for about an hour till it was somewhat firm. But I thought these were too soft (but then I don't care for soft cookies) - if I was to make them again I'd use half white and half brown sugar to help with that.  They also had just a tad too much "stuff" in them for me - "stuff" overload.  My vote is three stars, for being too soft with too much of the chips, toffee and nuts.  But I figured that exactly what I DIDN'T like about these cookies would be the very things Hubs did. Sure enough - as he was chewing he held up 5 fingers (rare).  He said what he liked about them was that that they were gooey (my "too much stuff") and soft.  Tastes and reviews are so subjective!  Four star average between the two of us.

THE HIT OF THE SEASON! Not a soul who tried one of these couldn't pass on seconds! I did use 1c brown sugar ~ 1/2c wht.  Also, we purchased a bag of milk choc chips that also had Christmas Trees and Red stocking shapes mixed in and used the whole bag of that instead of combining semi-sweet & milk choc (also making them look more festive).  Finally, I did half a batch w/ pecans and half w/out (therefore only using 1/2c pecans).  Even non-cookie lovers (like myself) had snatched a handful here and there.  Thanks a bunch Barb.  Every Minnesotan I served to agreed to these being the best on my platter!

I was really disappointed with this cookie...it sounded so good, but it just didn't taste right to me.  I think it was the brown sugar cookie base that I didn't like.  If all these toppings were in a regular, chewy cookie I'd have liked it better...definately not making again.

These cookies were delicious and I will definitely make them again.  I've already
been asked for the recipe too.  My only problem was that I couldn't find actual 
toffee baking bits, so I crushed Heath bars and used those instead. They worked fine!

I decided to surprise my husband with these (he's originally from Minnesota). They were wonderful & chewy gooey- just the way I like them. Between the two of us and our daughter, we scarfed down all the cookies within 2-3 days!

This is an exceptionally good cookie recipe. If you follow the directions and remove the cookies after 10 to 12 minutes, they will still be wet and undercooked. They finish setting up on the cookie sheet as directed. The people who complain of the cookies not flattening are not following directions -- they're waiting for the cookie to be done in the oven. The cookie will fall/flatten on the cookie sheet as they keep cooking. If you follow the directions these work out great. The reason this isn't a five star is because it needs more Heath chips -- at least a full cup if not more. At 2/3 cup they're undetectable. Also, for those who complain this cookie is too sweet -- it has THREE kinds of chips/candy!! It's a cookie! What do you expect? It's supposed to be sweet! Great recipe.

I was disappointed with the way this cookie turned out.  Maybe my butter was too soft because the cookies were flat and brown, although the flavor was still pretty good.  I'm going to give it one more shot before I decide to keep or toss this recipe.

This cookie is very good!  It was soft and chewy and tasted great warm!  I followed some other reviewers and used ½ sugar and ½ brown sugar.  I had better luck cooking the cookies for 10 minutes then taking them out of the oven and leaving them on the cookie sheet a couple of minutes.  It seemed like they just got too done when I cooked them in the oven for 11 or 12 minutes.  Thanks for a good cookie recipe!

I found these on another site under the name Minnesota Munchers.  They are so good!  Very rich tasting.  I undercook them a little because I like softer cookies.  I also used a combination of semi-sweet and white chocolate chips because I didn't have milk chocolate ones.  Definitely will make again!!

It's a good, easy cookie recipe.  Put a little pecans in it, and it turns out perfectly.

These cookies are great - I added 1/4c extra flour because I don't like cookies that are too flat.  I also drizzled melted chocolate on top to dress them up for a cookie exchange I took them to.  I was able to get 5 dozen from this recipe.

I kind of made these a 'garbage' cookie. I had some left over white, butterscotch and chocolate chips that needed to be used up. So I used those with the toffee bits. They baked up nicely and I was left with a chewy chocolatey cookie. I made a coupple into a homemade ice cream sandwich and it was 5 stars that way! Otherwise, I think maybe some oats in them would be good, and maybe a touch more brown sugar.

These cookies were to die for! Between me and my other females roommates, the batch didn't last through the weekend! The only adjustments I made were using white chocolate chips (more like 3/4 instead of 1/2 a cup) instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips and slightly more than two teaspoons of vanilla, and the results were phenomenal!

Well, I'm proud to be a Minnesotan if these are the state's best cookies!  These are awesome.  The toffee bits are what make the cookie.  Mine came out flatter, most likely because I used room-temp butter.  If you want yours a little thicker, then chill the dough.  I baked them for 12 min., then I let the cookies cool on the sheet for 5 min., then removed them to a cooling rack.  Thank you for this recipe!

I used egg replacer and they were still delicious!  Remember to cook them no longer than 12 minutes, though.  They get rock solid (though still passable when dipped in rice milk)  :)

Husband loved them (5 stars from him), I think it is fine, just a little too sweet. Made them as written with the pecans. If I make it again, I'd use less sugar and alittle more salt. Putting the dough in the fridge did help the cookies stand a little taller.

This recipe is truly a treat! It has so many different flavors within one cookie. I am tempted to try this cookie as an oatmeal cookie. I believe that would be a hearty, delicious version of this recipe.

These are probably the best cookies I've ever made. Like others suggested, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I also used a full cup of toffee candy. They are truly incredible. My kids were literally fighting over them. Hubby wouldn't keep his paws off of them... or the dough while I was baking. A definite keeper!

Great cookie.  Love the milk and semi-sweet combination as well as the addition of the toffee chips.  These didn't last long.

I ran across this recipe while searching for a cookie that would incorporate odds and ends I had leftover after my holiday baking.  I used white chocolate chips, Heath bar bits and a couple of Hershey bars that I chopped up.  Like other reviewers, I used equal amounts of white and brown sugar.  My kids asked me not to use nuts.  I think I would have preferred them with nuts to counter balance the sweetness. I think the real key with this cookie is to underbake them slightly.  I cooked them in my convection oven at 325 and really watched them.  As soon as the edges began to brown every so slightly, I removed them.  When cooled, they were crispy on the outside and still slightly tender in the middle.  Mine spread perfectly - but I DID flatten them just a bit before baking.

It was really good. I used an ungreased cookie sheet and put 2 1/4 cups flour and used butter flavored crisco instead of butter and it was even better!
They were soft yet flaky on the outside~!

This is a very good, tender and rich cookie.  The taste and texture is similar to a sandies type cookie.  This most likely will appeal to adults more than to children - my younger kiddos, who are typically cookie fiends, didn't care for them.

A word of caution, this cookie did not spread at all and the first batch came out high, rounded and spoon-shaped - not very attractive.  The second batch came out beautifully after I flattened them a bit before baking.

Yummy cookie! Mine did not spread out too terribly much. I baked in the convection oven at 325 and they took 9 minutes. I changed nothing about the recipe itself. I found them to be on the edge of too sweet, maybe could cut down on the milk chocolate next time, or try with dark chocolate chips...yummy...thanks for sharing the recipe, Clogger!

I have never heard of this famous cookie and decided to try it. I did a half a recipe and got 34 cookies with a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop. I thought they tasted very much like a Nestle Toll House cookie with added pecans and caramel like bits. They are a bit sweet, for my taste with the added toffee, but they did dissapear quite fast.

This is the best cookie!! My husband doesn't like many cookies, but he can't keep his hands off these. I did use 1 cup of brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar and only milk chocolate chips. Delicious!

We loved this cookie. Who doesn't love chocolate and toffee? I did chill the dough before baking and they turned out great. This recipe makes alot of cookies. Thanks for a great alternative to a plain chocolate chip.

Made as the recipe was listed and it turned out perfect!  The only change I made was to cook on parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets.  They were delicious!  Took them to work and they ate them all within minutes.

This is definitely a delicious cookie - I made a batch for a bake sale, and used the 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar suggestion. I would never make these for my own house due to the ridiculous amount of butter, though! I may try a modified version.

Although it was a very good cookie, I thought it had too much stuff in it.  I wouldve liked it better with just the toffee, semi sweet chocolate chips and nuts.  the addition of milk chocolate to me makes it too sweet for my liking.  I do agree with other reviewers this tastes great for a day or two, after that the cookie gets crumbly and dry

These cookies are delicious!  I didn't have many of the 'extras' around the house, so I made these with just chocolate chips and chopped almonds.  Yummy.  They stayed nice and fluffy, even in my high-altitude CO kitchen!  

...Plus, I'm more than a little proud that these hail from my home state:-).  From now on I'm including these along with 'hotdishes' in listing MN recipes...

I was looking for a cookie recipe which didn't have a need for Baking SODA (which my bf who I love had ruined by letting a soda can explode in the freezer...) HAHAHA
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe... The cookies turned out really well - I had to flatten them a little but they baked well, and I also had to drop the cook time slightly to 9-10 mins ( I think my oven is hot).  I used parchment paper, and it was a dream to clean up. 

Reccomend this recipe to anyone :)

I had high hopes for these, they sounded so good!  My cookies didn't flatten hardly at all.  I'll probably try the chip/nut combo again but just using my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe (Tollhouse).

Good cookie. Good taste.   I also did only 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  The edges seem to bake much quicker then the center of the cookie so you really have to watch them.   I actually turned down the temp alittle so the insides had a little more time to bake. Probably will not make these again.

These cookies are good, but not great. I followed the recipe to the letter (one exception - I left out the semi-sweet chips because I don't have any and I only had 1/2 cup of pecans left) and they just don't seem right to me. Maybe its just me!

I was looking for a recipe that would use toffee bits.  I made a couple of changes to it though.  I used 1 cup of toffee bits, and 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  I also changed the brown sugar amount.  I changed it to 3/4 cup br sugar, and added 3/4 cup white sugar.

They were delicious and my whole family loved them!

These cookies are sinfully delicious!  I made a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand, and also to try to cut down on the fat a smidge.  I added a heaping 1/4c of chopped walnuts, semi-sweet chips & white chips then added around a 1/2c of mounds coconut flakes.  Dangerously addictive!  Thanks Barb!

This was a positively scrumptious cookie with lots to love! It's delightfully unique from any other cookie I've ever eaten--- and there have been SO many! We left outs the nuts...(with apologies to squirrels everywhere), and the toffee makes it heavenly! These cookies also just look way cool and the bake up real plump. YUM!

Too soft of a cookie and the bottoms got done before the tops.  I'm guessing solid shortening would help but I'm not trying again. I guess we are all different in our tastes!

This seemed like my kind of cookie, with the addition of toffee bits. However, contrary to most other reviewers who ended up with puffy, cakey cookies (which I love!), mine turned out flat.....but very chewy, which is a good attribute for a cookie. Granted, I didn't chill the dough and probably left my butter at room temp too long. Because I didn't want that much "stuff" in these cookies, (and largely because I'm not really much of a chocolate chip cookie fan), I only added the chocolate toffee bits (since I halved the recipe, I added extra toffee bits.) I want to play around with the texture, so next time (and there will be a next time), I'll take some reviewer suggestions of using half white and brown sugars, using a smidge more baking powder, chilling the dough, and adding some mini chocolate chips to appease the husband. I'm a sucker for any recipe with a toffee addition, so thanks for this tasty submission!

I was so disappointed in this cookie. I am an experienced cookie baker. First, the bottom cooked way before the top. I semi-fixed this by lowering the oven temp to 340deg and cooked for 11 min, taking out when the top is still moist (I do this with all cookies). Second, there is not enough salt in this recipe. Assuming you use unsalted butter (which is the norm in recipes unless notated), 1/4 tsp is not enough. Granted, I left out the toffee bits, and that would add some saltiness, but still, I would up it to 1/2 tsp. They were just too bland. Third: texture. This was a fluffy cookie, no chewiness at all, which really disappointed me, since it is a 'brown sugar butter cookie'. I'm not sure how to fix that issue. Next time, I will make my tried and true favorite chocolate chip cookies with all brown sugar and have much better results than this one.

My boyfriend and I love these cookies. I ended up adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour - the batter was slightly too thin, substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the milk chocolate, and macadamia nuts for the pecans. Yummy!!

Three & A Half Stars... Texturally perfect cookies, but they're soooo sweet.  I did use Butter Flavor Crisco, and only half a cup of the pecans (DH is not a fan of nuts).  I'm gonna try these again, but cut the brown sugar by at least 1/2 a cup.

The title of these caught my eye, and I'm glad they did. These are wonderful! I've never used toffee bits in cookies before, and they are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly (except I did not use pecans) and they turned out great. I also used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets. The dough was really soft so I was worried at first, but it firmed up after I added all the dough and it sat in the fridge 5-10 minutes. 
Thanks for the great recipe!

I did 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar... doing it again I think I would do more brown sugar but less butter (or rather, I'd like a less buttery taste but don't know if putting in less butter would mess up the consistency). I also just used chocolate chips and dark chocolate chunks rather than all the morsels the recipe called for. I think it came out tasty - more buttery than I had expected but very good.

It sounded terrific, but I think there is just too much going on in this cookie. I will probably just play with my normal chocolate chip cookie and add some toffee bits.

This recipe was pretty easy and the cookies cooked very quickly. I took the advice from others and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I could not find toffee bits, so instead of chocolate chips and toffee chips, I used Heath Bar bits. It worked nicely, everyone at work raved about them and asked for the recipe.

Great cookies!  I loved the brown sugar cookie base - might just become the base for all my 'chocolate chip-type' cookies!  I would suggest underbaking them a bit, or removing them immediately from the baking sheet, to avoid crispy cookies...  still great, but not our preference!  By the way, these freeze GREAT!  Great for company!  Thanks for the recipe Barb!

This cookie was pretty good.  I think the combination of chips & toffee was good but combined with the brown sugar dough, it made it a little too sweet for my taste.

These were really good cookies. Halfway through baking them my oven broke, so I pressed them into the pan from my toaster oven and made them into bar cookies, which I ended up liking more than the drop cookies. Sweet, chewy, and gone way too soon:)

This is an outstanding recipe in texture, taste and it's a simple drop cookie.
