I am the submitter of this recipe and realise I forgot to mention that the fresh mozzarella should be shredded into pieces by hand before mixing with the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Hope you like them.

really lovely recipe with lots of options!  I made it as written and loved it, but I will put the battered blossoms in the freezer on parchment paper for about 20 minutes next time to help maintain a thin crispy and complete coating.
