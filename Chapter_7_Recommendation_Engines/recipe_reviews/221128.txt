I made it for my mother on Mother's Day and everyone loved it!  This recipe is a keeper.  I ran out of ramekins becasue I made such a big batch.  So I  baked the rest in sprayed cupcake papers.  When they were done, I set them out, and they looked and tasted delicious!

My husband loves Eggs Benedict and he rates this as a keeper.  I made it for dinner as I'm not of fan of crab for breakfast.  This makes 2 hearty servings so can be made into 4 smaller servings.  It's a rich dish so I would prefer the smaller serving.

LOVED IT! Made this for an early Mother's Day Brunch and it was devoured! This was the epidemy of brunch. It captured every flavor you could want and more. I made a couple modifications...Dungeness crab is super expensive so I used 1/2 crab and 1/2 smoked salmon. Oh my goodness, this was a super fabulous idea. I might make this with only smoked salmon next time because we loved the subtle smoky flavor it brought to the dish. Aside from this, I followed the recipe to a "T". I will most definitely be making this one again and again! Thanks Chef John and Allrecipes!!

This is a great breakfast dish, with all the essentials in one dish.
The bacon crab bread pudding mixture makes two large portions, and as the chef suggested, I topped each portion with two eggs. I did not have large ramekins and personally did not care for the "overflowing" presentation. Instead, I used two - 12 oz square (4.75 x4.75) Corningware dishes. The plus side to this was it gave the bread pudding more surface area for crunch and the eggs and hollandaise stayed contained within the dish, making eating much easier. After 20 minutes at 400 degrees my pudding was still a tad moist so I just place it under the broiler till dry (about 1 minute). I used the Blender Hollandaise Sauce also found in AllRecipes. Nice combinations of flavors and a new favorite for breakfast.

Great recipe! I went heavy on bacon and crab and added a little more cream but turned out perfect. I also did my peppers and onion in food processor together and saut√©.  Love this recipe will be a family favorite

One of the more complicated breakfasts I've made, but totally worth it! One of my wife's favorite dishes when we go out for brunch, and this was even better. I used king crab, no substitutions.

Was not a fan of the "bread pudding." Did not feel it added anything to the dish.

This was an awesome brunch with roasted asparagus! I made the recipe just as written. I needed to double it and the only thing I did not double was the tarragon. I recipe make 2 large servings (could be easily 3) I used the 18.6 oz ramekins for 1 serving and had room at the top for 2 eggs and asparagus. I will definitely make again!

This was really delicious, I had leftovers and needed to sprinkle some water on it to keep from drying out while reheating in the oven. Worked out great!

Elizabeth the vinegar would go in the water you poach the eggs in.
I rated it only because I couldn't post my comment without rating. I have not made it yet.

It was great! I accidently added too much lemon juice from the fresh lemon, and had to use two slices of bacon because when cooked it shrunk a lot... But it was still amazing. Definitely making again. Except less lemon juice and more bacon.
