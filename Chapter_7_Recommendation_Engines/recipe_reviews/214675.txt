I made this recipe for the first time for a 4th of July last year.  It was a winner and I made several batches becuse it became a regular request for the rest of the cookouts during tht e summer of 2010.  I was looking for this again so I can use it today because of the beautiful weather here in Florida.  Wonderful flavor and great reason to get together with friends and family.

I use the recipe basically as is except for the marinating time.  I always get shrimp when it is on sale.  I purchase at least 10 lbs in two pound portions.  When I get home I make the marinade x5 and place each portion of marinade in gallon zip lock freezer bags.  I place the shrimp in the marinade and freeze making sure they are laying flat so they freeze into a flat sheet of goodness.  When I know I will be needing one of these, I place it in the refrigerator to thaw.  During the thawing process they merinade and I cut down on my prep time because I already did this ahead of time.  Happy cooking and thanks for this delicious recipe.

Made 6lbs as an appetizer a large party, served COLD.  It was excellent & so much easier for a crowd because it was made the day before.  Served with Amy's Cilantro dip.  Everyone loved this, I even got calls the next day about it.  EDIT: Per another reviewers advice I froze a portion of this to use another day.  It did not taste the same.  MUCH better fresh.

I made this for our appetizer on Memorial Day, since we were doing everything on the BBQ.  I don't do fish OR spicy, but my family does.  I put in half the amount of red pepper flakes, and let it marinate for little over an hour.......have to say they are AWESOME, my family can't wait until next weekend so we can have them again, thanks for sharing!!  I was also happy to take a picture and post it.

Yummy, yummy!  Prepared exactly as written and these were a huge hit!  Not a ton of liquid in this recipe, so don't overcook, and brush with a little butter/lemon towards the end of cooking time or serve with a sauce for some moisture.  Really loved these, Sue!

If you like shrimp and you like spicy chipotle you will LOVE this recipe.  I had a bag of frozen shrimp and some chipotles that I had leftover and frozen from a previous recipe.  This was easy to do and so tasty.  Didn't change the recipe at all except for adding some extra chipotles because I didn't want to refreeze them.  We chopped up the shrimp to use in tacos.  I threw some more cilantro on top with chopped red onions then gave them a squeeze of lime juice- YUM!  My husband loved this meal and asked for it again already.  I'll have to cut back on the chipotles to make it kid friendly, but this one is a winner.  Thanks for sharing.

These were quite possibly the best shrimp I've ever had.  They were super HOT the night I made them -- I might cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.  When we ate them as leftovers with black beans and rice, however, the heat level was perfect.  I'd definitely suggest the beans -- I think they cut down on the heat!

Deliciously spicy - the flavors marinate in no time.  Great for a last minute cookout.  We used this as an appetizer because it cooks so quickly.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

You really have to like spicy to like this, and my husband does.  I ate it, too, but had a glass of water nearby.  The shrimp had great flavor, and this recipe came together very quickly.

Did this with fresh lime juice tonight, (no lemon).  Just as good!! This is my original recipe.  Thank you for all the kind reviews.  WE love this recipe!  Can also place all ingredients (sans shrimp) into blender or food processor.

if you're looking for shrimp with a kick, this recipe is it!! i marinated the shrimp overnight instead of just for 30 minutes because the marinade smelled SO good! the shrimp were a huge hit with the guys - even they had to choke back tears! i will be making this recipe as often as i can.

I made this recipe as is (except I forgot the cilantro) and it was awesome!  I will definitely make it again.  I think that the marinade would do really well with chicken as well.  Just the right amount of spice!

This an amazing marinade.  I'm addicted to it now.  It works well on chicken, too.  Ridiculously easy to make - I have all of the ingredients handy, so it's a no-brainer.  I add a bit more olive oil, to ensure the shrimp or chicken don't stick.  I opt out on the cilantro - it's not necessary.

Wowzers!  For the 1st time ever, I bought Chipolte peppers in adobo sauce!  I did a tiny finger taste before adding them to the marinade and decided we were not really made for each other :)  I added 1 tsp of finely diced hot red pepper and added no cayene as I know I am not a fan.  I still found them a bit spicy, but DELISH!!!!  I only realized now as I came back to review that I doubled the red pepper flakes by mistake.  We loved them!  Served with cuke/sweet pepper salad tossed in tzatizi dressing.  Rice would have paired nicely also, but dieting and without it, this recipe and salad is in the rules!

Made according to recipe exactly.  One of the best marinades for shrimp ever. has a nice kick but more flavorful than spicy. They were gone in minutes. Perfect for shrimp tacos with feta crumbles. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe twice already and love it! Just made it at a BBQ for about 15 people and everyone who had them loved them! I did substitute lemons for limes and it's still wonderful!

I did freeze some of the marinade that I didn't use. A week later I took it out of the freezer, put some frozen chicken tenders into the marinade. Let sit in frig all day and grilled them up for dinner. Perfect! Conclusion: if you like this marinade, make it in a big batch and freeze portions of it for future use!

I made this exactly by the recipe except I substitued a lime for the lemon and used a lot more cilantro.  I served zucchini noodles and marinara topped with the grilled shrimp. My guest loved it.

This was good.  I didn't add the cayenne because I was afraid it would be too hot but I don't think it would be.  Next time I am going to use this for shrimp tacos or a salad with Cilantro Lime Dressing, another recipe from this site that is excellent!

Made this last week for my husband and daughter and got rave reviews.  Only did it with a pound of shrimp and they were begging for more. Only thing I changed was I used smoked paprika instead of sweet.  I plan to try this same marinade on Mahi Mahi tonight.  Delicious and perfect amount of spice!

I was looking for a recipe for grilled shrimp that used Chipolte. This recipe is outstanding. Everyone loved it. If I had more they would have eaten it. Be sure to serve with lemon wedges for an unforgettable meal.

This was really very good.   I am giving it 5 stars because if I added the cayenne and red pepper flacks it would have the required heat.  I left them out, because I was using this an ingredient in a black bean, corn, shrimp and and avocado tostada. The blacke beans had a chili and so did the roasted tomato salsa.  So I figured with all those other chili’s  I would tame the shrimp a bit( of course I used the chipoltles); mistake.  Either my jalapeños for salsa were the tamest chilies ever or the person who wrote that recipe liked really mild salsa.  Anyway, it ends up the shrimp becoming the shining star of my tostada and next time , no skimping on the peppers.  Make these on their own or use them in tacos, salads , whatever way you like.  A really good recipe for a great base ingriedent .

These were amazing and if you like smoky chipotle flavors you will probably love these. I did not have a grill but cooked in a cast iron pan. they were smoky and spicy without being too much. I will definitely make these over and over!!!

This was amazing the day of and the leftovers were just as amazing!!!  We are on the Keto diet so this was perfect as I made cheddar tortillas for my wife and I used lettuce.  We couple this with the Cilantro Jalapeño aioli and the combination was to die for!!

I left out the cilantro since not everyone in my household likes it but they still turned out very well.  Nice flavor kick with all the peppers!  My friend doesn't like shrimp unless its breaded, but he liked this!

Delicious! I can't take too spicy, so I made the sauce without the crushed pepper and cayenne pepper and pulled some out for my shrimp.  Then I added the pepper ingredients per the recipe.  My husband loved this shrimp.  The recipe is a keeper.

Left out the cayenne and red pepper flakes as I felt that might be to hot for our family , Turned them into Shrimp tacos and added an avocado spread made w/ jar salsa,  half and half mayo and sour cream w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder and lime juice. These were the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. We cooked the shrimp just one minute on the barbie and they were perfect. Hope this helps you and you and enjoy it as much as we did.

Very good. I would reduce the heat a touch for my taste, but my husband thought it was perfect. The seasoned shrimp could be used in a lot of recipes. Would be great in an Alfredo.

Made this recipe for my very non-traditional Christmas dinner this year. I did omit the optional cilantro, as I despise cilantro. Big hit with the family, that said we all enjoy spicy, so use your discretion. But let me say, as a person who doesn't normally care for shrimp of any kind, this recipe has opened my eyes and I can't wait to make it again!

This was a big hit at a large family gathering. It's spicy and tangy and makes a great appetizer. I used 6 lbs of raw frozen shrimp from Costco and thawed them under cool water. I made the marinade in a blender and added a touch of cumin and doubled the amount of cilantro  as well. I divided the marinade and thawed shrimp into 2 gallon ziplock bags and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour. Since skewering this much  shrimp would take too long I just baked them in a single layer on a broiler sheet for 8 minutes on 380 as per another reviewers suggestion. They came out excellent and were devoured promptly!

Ok, so I made this exactly to specifications...when it came to all the seasonings. I wanted to make it with a bit more sustenance si I used half the amount of shrimp, all the marinade and instead of cooking it in the grill, I dumped the whole bowl of marinade and shrimp into a pan. I sautéed it for a bit and then added heavy whipping cream to make a cream sauce out if it. Pouted it in some penny...and it made the best Cajun shrimp pasts ever!!

I made it according to the recipe but it was too spicy for my  non Hispanic guests.  I didn't particularly like the flavor. I used the baked potato side as suggested and that made it tolerable.

i don't know how fair of a review i can really make of this recipe as i substituted chipotle powder (1/2 tsp) and bottled lemon juice (1/4 cup) for the recipe (that i halved).. although the spice was there, there was no pop.. ~~UPDATE: after a bit of tweaking this turned into a 5 star dish.. i used the zest and juice of 4 small lemons, upped the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to 3, used 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, doubled the kosher salt, added about 1 tsp of cumin and left out the dried peppers and paprika.. cooked this on a our gas grill using our island grill stone.. this would totally work on chicken or pork as well.. glad i gave this another try

We followed the recipe exactly. It was plenty spicy but a bit overpowering, we felt, for using on the delicate shrimp taste.
We will keep the recipe and try it on the more robust flavors of beef  that hopefully would not be masked by the spices.
