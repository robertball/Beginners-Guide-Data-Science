This thanksgiving I made two pumpkin pies. One using this recipe, and one using the tradition recipe on the can of pumpkin. I made this low-sugar pumpkin pie mainly because my aunt and grandfather are both diabetic, but it ended up being a hit with everyone! My grandmother says it's the best pumpkin pie she has ever tasted, and thats saying something considering shes tasted a lot of pie in her 80+ years on this earth. My 12 year old sister refused to try it, saying she didn't like fake sugar. However, I tricked her into eating a peice of this pie by telling her it was the regular kind. She loved it and admitted that it was even better than the other stuff.

This is my new favorite holiday pie! You would never know that the sugar has been reduced.The spices are just perfect and the taste is fantastic. Even if I weren't watching my calories I would make this pie. (P.S. I used fat free half and half to cut the calories even more.)

I have two diabetics in my immediate family, so this pumpkin pie was a must for Thanksgiving dinner.  It got rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  I made it exactly as the recipe read.

This was very tasty! I made this after dinner and it's already 3/4's gone! I did use regular sugar instead of splenda and still came out great. I liked the fact that you could use Half & Half instead of evaporated or sweetened milk.

I tried it, it's a wonderful recipe, but I wouldn't encourage people to use SPLENDA in general. Aspartane, the other kind of non-suger sweetener, has already been scientificly proven to be dangerous for your health, and it's probably only a matter of time until the same thing happens with SPLENDA. But otherwise, it was very good :)

I was just bored today and decided I would make something to eat.  I came on allrecipes.com looking for something and somehow, in the middle of summer, pumpkin pie seemed like a good idea.  The pie is delicious, though next time I will be careful to either make my own crust or buy a better brand.  I did not use splenda, instead using normal sugar, only because I do not have lots of money and couldn't afford to spend any extra on splenda.  It turned out magnificent and I appreciate this post.

This was pretty good, but the texture was a bit lighter than I'm used to with pumpkin pie.  I made my own crust with walnuts, butter, and a bit of flour.  I think next time I make a pumpkin pie, I will use a regular sugar recipe and just sub Splenda for the sugar.

I used low fat evaporated milk instead of whole evaporated milk, but other than that, I followed the recipe, even using REAL brown sugar.  It was great, not too creamy, but the tast was just fine, and I WILL make this one again!

I love this with only the cinnamon in it. It is too spicy for me with it all. Been baking it that way for 50+ years.  Loved by all that eat it. Used Saccahrin until Splenda came along.

This pie wasn't my favorite. It was too spicy for my taste. I think next time I will trade the ginger for some nutmeg.

I have prepared this recipe at least a dozen times.  It always gets rave reviews!  A diabetic friend gave me a big kiss at Thanksgiving for preparing pumpkin pie that she could eat and enjoy too.  I highly recommend this one!

I am on a candida diet....no sugar,  white flour, dairy, etc. I made this pie and used soy milk and a whole wheat pie crust....topped off with sugar free cool whip and it was wonderful! Will make it again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a BIG hit.  I also substituted the Splenda brown sugar for the brown sugar using the appropriate measure.  No one even knew it wasn't real sugar in the recipe.

GREAT recipe!!!!  Easy to make and scrumptious.  This was the favorite of all the pie on our Thanksgiving table.  Used evaporated skim milk instead of half and half like another person suggested.

My 31 year-old son said this was the best pumpkin pie he has ever had.  Instead of using half-n-half (I didn't have it), I used 3/4 cup of skimmed evaporated milk.  Wasn't sure how it would taste, but it was awesome!!!

Very ono (delicious) pie!  No one could tell it used Splenda and it allowed me to have a piece.  I did substitute the brown sugar with a brown sugar substitute and no fat half/half as well and it worked really well.  Will use again and again!

I added 1/8 tsp nutmeg because I didn't have any cloves and it was still great! I love the ginger flavor, and my husband had no idea that it was made with Splenda.

I love this recipe!!!  It's my favorite!  I tried using real pumpkin and it worked!  Just make sure you bake it, not boil it.  It works beautifully.  My Grandma loves it too.  She gave me another pumpkin so I could make her another one.  She still doesn't believe I made it with Splenda!

I made the receipe using not only the splenda sweetener but the splenda brown sugar as well.  It turned out great and the flavor is wonderful.  I shared a piece with a co-worker and she couldn't tell the difference.

I dislike pumpkin pie but decided to make one this Thanksgiving for the family instead of buying one.  This was actually very good (did I mention I don't like pumpkin pie?)  I used regular sugar though.  Very easy.  My 10 yr old son helped, which always make it taste better!

Oh, man, this was soooo good.  My hubby is type II diabetic, so I was looking for something with less sugar.  We couldn't tell the difference between this and pumpkin pie made with real sugar.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The only difference was that I used my grandmother's homemade pie crust.  It's the best.  I've seen several very similar recipes here on Allrecipes.  It's got egg and white vinegar in it.  I'd suggest trying it sometime - it's very easy and very good!  Thank you for this recipe!

Okay, I admit using regular sugar to Splenda. I was just looking for a basic pumpkin pie recipe.  Unfortunately, this wasn't it.  There was a little too much filling and one of my pies spilt over.  I will continue looking for another pumpkin pie recipe.

EDIT --- Tastes WAAAAAY better when chilled overnight!  But I'm going to cut down on the sugar because it's a little bit too sweet for my liking.
