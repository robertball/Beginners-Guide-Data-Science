Fantastic!  I just made this in a 9 x 13 in casserole dish, added garlic pepper, garlic powder and red pepper flakes.   Cooked it for 1hr uncovered and served it with boiled baby red potatoes with butter.  Delish!  This is so easy and quick to put together.  Will definetly make again.

Very good and very easy!!  I love that it was so fast to prepare and didn't require any chopping!  It didn't need any sauces or gravy because it was so moist.  I halved the recipe (using a 6oz box of stuffing mix) and baked it for 45 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'll definitely make it again!

i chose this recipe after realizing at the last minute i was out of bread crumbs and i had my heart set on turkey meatloaf.  i found this to be a little bit too "wet" for my taste -but all in all it was good.  i enjoyed the flavor that the stuffing seasoning gave to the loaf.  my kids sliced it thin and ate it on rolls like a hamburger, and i diced up my leftovers tonight and ate them in a caesar salad (love the versatility!!)  thanks!

I only needed one loaf, so I halved everything and baked for about 40 mins.  Aside from my slice, my boyfriend ate the rest of the loaf.  He LOVED it! Great way to change up the ground turkey.   I added 1/3 cup romano/asiago cheese, a palm full of garlic powder and a palm full of parsley for a little extra. Will definitely make again!

So delicious, but WAY too much for 6 servings unless you are feeding lumberjacks! Added a 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flake, and  1/2 TBLS Italian Seasoning. Delicious! Also only used 1/ 1.5 C H20, and added some sauteed sliced portabellos! Served with mash potatoes, mac n' cheese, and steamed broccoli. The perfect Sunday Dinner!

Incredibly easy and moist.  I did add garlic powder and pepper to the meat before adding the stuffing. I also used 1-1/4 lb of ground turkey and 6 oz of stuffing mix. Baked for about 45 minutes or so. Kids liked it and there were no leftovers!

We really liked this.  I always use ground turkey for my meatloaf, but this was a nice variation on the old standby.  I only used a 6 oz bag of stuffing and 1.5 lbs of meat.  Still used 2 eggs and seasoned with garlic salt, pepper and some italian seasoning.  It really had plenty of flavor without a sauce on top but brown gravy might be good to try next time.

This is now a memorized, staple recipe in our house. Made it many times. I've used all 3 Mrs. Cubbison's flavors, and like the herb best. Also added cooked chopped leftover turkey for fantastic results.

Doubled this last night for a family of six adults who like leftover nights.  Used cornbread stuffing mix - think I'll use a milder mix next time as turkey flavor was a little overwhelmed.  Made into patties and stove cooked - very juicy, and for those who don't care for turkey, a solid hit. Will make again.

Quick and easy to make. I did use 3 pds of turkey because of the way it was packaged and based on what someone else said I cut the water to a cup.  I added a can of mushrooms, juice and all and a few onions. when it only had a few minutes to go I topped it off with a little turkey gravy. Bet the left overs dont last long.

Yum!  I loved it, DH says it needs veggies and/or onions, and ketchup baked on top.  Kids had to be forced to eat it, but I have to force them to eat anything but pizza...  I'll make it again, at least for me and DH!

So easy to make and lots of flavor.  Added some ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and parsley  in with the ground Turkey as suggested by another review.  I halved the recipe and cooked at 375F for 45 mins.  I cooked in a smaller loaf pan. Served with gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies.

My family really liked this, and I loved how easy it was to make!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great as is.  We did serve it with ketchup, though.  This will definitely become a regular meal in our house.  I will probably use a little less water next time.  However, the turkey I used was quite fatty for turkey, so I imagine the amount of water may depend on the amount of fat in the turkey.

I’ve made it twice before and it tasted great, especially with the Easy Cranberry Orange Glaze on top.  This time it was a little bland, but it may be because I made mini-loaves and cooked them at 350*F.  I was trying to cook Green Bean Casserole in the oven at the same time.

Quick & easy. I made  4 mini loafs, one left plain,  added cheese to one, Sweet BBQ sauce another & puree veggie with spinach the last. The BBQ was too sweet, combining the cheese & veggie was the fav.  Will serve it and a beef meat loaf at dinner for 30!   Maybe will use a little more turkey.  Very good!

6 16 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/216058/easiest-turkey-loaf/ ... For ease, five stars; taste, four; after tweaking, a "good" four.  :D  Strangely, this is the same recipe as the stuffing box - except 1c water (not heated) & adding some barbecue (eh?!).  I didn't tweak, but if I make again, I'd add some celery, carrots & onion.  It's not so pretty either so maybe a sauce on top - after baking.  I followed the 1c from the box & didn't have any "too moist" issues.

Well, we loved my simpler version of this recipe. I evenly blended the box of dry stuffing mix and one egg into 2.5 lbs of ground turkey. I shaped it into a rectangle and baked it in a covered pan for one hour. My husband raved and went back for seconds (rare event). It was plenty moist and well seasoned with no additional water, salt, or pepper. This quick and easy recipe will be repeated often since it is week-night friendly when served with a side of steamed in the bag veggies! Easy, fast, and healthy!

I made this tonight and it was mostly a success.  I made just a half recipe for 3 people and it was more than enough.  I used less water than was called for on the boxed stuffing based on previous comments, and the loaf was very moist, but not mushy at all.  It was very difficult to find boxed stuffing that did not have MSG and/or high fructose corn syrup, but other than that I have no complaints and will make this again.

Followed the recipe as is and the texture of this came out weird and extremely unappetizing.. I can't even speak for the flavor because we couldn't get past the texture being akin to soggy bread and awkward mystery meat loaf. Yikes.
