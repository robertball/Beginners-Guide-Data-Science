I liked this recipe. I made some alterations though, so I only gave it 4 stars. I used unsweetened coconut, and I added ginger, not cardamon. I made these to give away for Christmas, and my relatives do not like cardamon.

I also melted semi-sweet chocolate chips, with a little bit of butter, and I dipped the square blocks of cut burfi into the melted chocolate, and I let them set on a rack to dry, one side at a time.

They looked good, and tasted great. My relatives liked them a lot.
Thanks for this recipe.

I added the cardamom plus a dash of rose water.  These turned out quick and moist--didn't have to change a thing!  Thanks!

Wonderful, so easy and so good.  While it is rich, it does not seem sinful.  I think that I may try it with fat free sweetened condensed milk.  Will let you know how that turns out.

Not sure what happened here, I followed the recipe exactly but even after 24 hours this still had not firmed up.  Such a shame as it looked delicious in the pan...

I made this fudge for an Indian luncheon our Dinner Club was having and the other ladies just raved about it!  I made it the night before and chilled it until about 30 minutes before serving.  The cardamom is very strong if you only chill the fudge for the one hour the recipe calls for.  I found that by making it a day ahead, the flavors had all blended nicely by serving time and the cardamom wasn't as over-powering.

I made small round balls and flattened them a little and rolled them in confectionry sugar and pistachios.  They are on the sweet side.  They turned out really good.

This did not work for me at all and I followed the recipe to the letter. It was sticky and gooey and didn't set. Next time I'll just microwave it longer (or maybe not - the end result was fun!) If I had to rate it on the taste though, it would get 5 stars. I salvaged it by forming little balls and rolling them in chopped toasted almonds then dipping in white chocolate. They were yummy anyway and it was like a feeding frenzy around the dish when they were put out!

These were great until I added the cardamom - I guess I don't care for it.  I may make again with no cardamom, or just a tiny bit.

This isn't that great. I did 1/3 of the recipe just because I had half a can of sweetened condensd milk I needed to use. So I wasn't sure how long to microwave it and I may have done it a little too long, but I don't think it would have been that great anyway. Way too sweet. I won't be making this again.

1 tablespoon of cardamom is excessive! Not only is the spice pretty strong even in small doses, it's rather expensive, so I hesitated after sniffing my container and only put in a teaspoon. Even at that, it made a pretty strong presence, so I can imagine three times that would have made it inedible to me. The resulting candy was pretty good though, and if you are used to a strong punch of cardamom, I suppose the recipe as-is might be what you are looking for.

I'm rating this highly even though it didn't turn into fudge for me (more like sludge), because the flavor was so good. No idea how to actually get it to solidify, but best of luck to you! My house has been using its sludge as ice cream topping for the last week. Yum.  I didn't have cardamom, so I seasoned with 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp cinnamon and a sprinkle of ground cloves.

Wow, this was very popular! I did it a little differently and therefore I have some questions.   1: I didn't have enough condensed milk, so I did 2/3 recipe. I added an extra 1/2 tsp. cardamom. This was fantastic!  2: I used unsweetened finely grated coconut. It was plenty sweet - in fact, having tasted it, I think sweetened coconut would be too much. When I make it again (which I definitely will!), I'll use unsweetened coconut again.   OK, questions: I did this on the stovetop - I am leary of the microwave for such things... maybe because of my microwave. I waited and waited for the coconut to bubble, but it did not, and since there is more solid than liquid in this recipe, it ended up scorching a bit, so I added a few TBSPs of milk.... the texture ended up possibly a bit sifter than traditional nariyal burfi... any suggestions as to how to correct this?   Is the coconut supposed to be completely soft in the final result or would it still maintain some of it's texture? I'd like it a bit softer, but cooking it in the fudge recipe any longer would have really burned and scorched it. I am wondering if I could boil it to soften it a bit before cooking it with the condensed milk, or will i lose some of the coconut flavor if I do this?   Thanks for the recipe and for any suggestions you may have. Cheers!

First, let me say I have no idea what "real" burfi is supposed to take like, but this is a great, fast and easy coconut candy recipe.  I made it around the holidays the first time, and make the recipe as directed except I added some pistachios and cut back on the cardamom powder.  The second time, to reduce the sugar, i used 1 can of condensed milk and for the remainder, used unsweetened evaporated milk (I did have to cook  a bit longer).  I added white chocolate, almonds, vanilla and dried cherries - also very good.  This recipe is better as it ages and dries out a little.  Don't try to take shortcuts in the microwave, it will boil over - like oatmeal - and make a big mess!

Interesting recipe. I used unsweetened coconut and it soaked up all the milk - is that normal? I ended up giving it less time in the microwave due to that. The bars were a little on the dry side but more than sweet enough. Also, I didn't want to waste the remaining half can of milk so I added unsweetened cocoa powder to it (about 1 1/2 T.) then drizzled it on top of the bars which gave it more of an Almond Joy flavour as I didn't use the cardamom.  Very chewy, but right tasty!

Unfortunately, this was not that good. It never firmed up, it was too gooey. And it was WAY too sweet! It tasted like I was eating condensed milk.

As written, it would be much too sweet with both sweetened coconut and sweetened condensed milk. Also, I think it's not really like burfi; it seems more like a shortcut recipe for Coconut Macaroons. Gave 2 Stars because it's a good flavor.

I have never had Indian Burfi before, so maybe the texture is accurate for the dish. But I thought it was incredibly gooey, I could barely pick it up. On top of that, the flavor wasnt great either.

Good, very rich.  Not sure I am a fan of cardamon.  I might mix half with and half without next time to see how I like it.  I only used half the cardamon.

This recipe is so very good.   The only thing I changed was I used 1/2  tsp of cardamon.  If they were dipped in choclate it would taste like a bounty bar....

Turned out perfectly...substituted the sweetened coconut with regular and it is not too sweet.  Followed the directions exactly and it set very well.  It was a big hit with my friends.

I advise only using 1 tsp. Rather than 1 tbsp. of cardamom as it overpowers the dessert. I tried cooking it on the stove instead of the microwave and it didn't want to set, we'll see how long it takes to set, if it does.

This is definitely not coconut burfi like I grew up with (that's with sugar syrup). Nonetheless this is delicious. I used 1 can condensed milk and 2 tbsp heavy whipping cream. Next time I'll pulse the coconut in grinder to make it a bit fine and also use a larger bowl for microwave as mine spilt over and made a mess

When I started I did not know what the end result was supposed to look like. I was afraid to overcook and ended up under cooking and the first batch did not set. I read through the reviews and I salvaged the delicious goo by rolling balls into crushed almonds. After some research and a second attempt, here are my suggestions: I skipped the microwave and opted for my large Dutch oven pot. The goo was too sweet for my taste so for the second batch I used of two cups sweetened coconut and one cup dry coconut flake (also to help with fluid absorption). Same amount of Sweetened condensed milk (21 oz total) and almonds. I warmed the pan on the stove over medium heat, added the coconut and milk. I brought the mixture to a slight bubble then dropped the temperature to a medium low and continued to simmer. I kept stirring and smoothing to keep the mixture from sticking or burning but maintained a high enough heat to get the moisture out. At about 20 minutes in, I added the almonds, mixed well and took off the heat. I immediately put in on a foil lined, oiled, round cookie sheet. It was set in about an hour, but I left it until morning. Cut and serve. Mine are still a tad sticky, so I don’t know the best way to present or serve. Still a work in progress.

I made this recipe for an Indian theme dinner. I microwaved as directed and it set up just fine. Instead of putting in a pan for squares I rolled mixture into small balls, put in small (petit four) cups and dipped tops in sugar coated fennel seeds for some colour. The recipe makes a large batch, I would reduce the amounts next time to match one can of milk. Thanks for recipe :)

Easy, Fast, and delicous.  I only like coconut with certain desserts and this is one of them.
