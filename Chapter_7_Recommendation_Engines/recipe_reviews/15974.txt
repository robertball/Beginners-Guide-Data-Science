Pretty non-descript the first time I made it. The next time I tried it with the following variations and really liked it much better: 1) Crush oreos for the crust instead of the pecan cookies. 2) Instead of granulated sugar mix the 8 oz cream cheese with 1/2 c butter (no substitution) 1 tsp vanilla and 1-1.5 c powdered sugar. 3) Top pudding with 1/4 c mini chocolate chips.

I have been making this for years with a slight change in method and a different name. I always add the whipped cream as a third layer and then sprinkle the leftover crumbs on top of the whole thing. This is much better after a day or two when everything has kind of blended together. My family and friends love this whenever I make it. Oh and it helps to get "whipped" cream cheese.

This is really tasty and so easy to make! I made whipped cream for the topping since I didn't have enough Cool Whip.

ahhh...it was okay. pretty much tasted like chocolate pudding in a pie crust with some whipped cream on top. i made this to take to someones house but it never made it...i am glad. i am known at work for my wonderful cooking this was a last minute deal that i had to make something quick for so i found this recipe. it was quick and easy. just not that impressed by it.

This pie was so easy to make. Very yummy. Not something you'd make often on a diet but super for a special occasion.
