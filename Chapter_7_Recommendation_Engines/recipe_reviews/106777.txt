Not bad! It cooked a little dense, so I feel I'll have to toast it before I eat it, but my husband who swears he doesn't like squash or zucchini liked this bread. It had a nice flavor.

I really enjoyed this and it was easy to make. Instead of baking in a loaf pan, I used a muffin tin and baked for 20-25 minutes.  It worked so well and will eliminate the mess of slicing bread, plus I can freeze individual portions.  This recipe made 16 regular sized muffins. I added some chocolate chips to some of the muffins before baking, as well.  This is probably the only recipe I'll use.

This is delish! I made it in the muffin pan also. I made 12 muffins, baked them for 27 minutes. I also added about a 1/4 C raisins  when I added the walnuts. I had bariatric surgery 3 years ago, and I have to say this is low enough in sugar (even natural) that is does not bother me. I will definitely make it again!

Good recipe, though a tad too sweet for my tastes. Just use a little less Splenda if you prefer it less sweet. I bake for a family member with diabetes, so have changed the recipe a bit to cut carbs and sugar. I use 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 3/4 cup almond meal or flaxseed meal. I also omit the applesauce, and add another egg or 2 egg whites.

Tasty, but could use more zucchini!  I think you could easily double the amount of zucchini and not damage the recipe.  I also subbed out 1/2 cup of the AP flour for white whole wheat.

I baked this in a glass pan and I don't think it dried the bread well enough for my family.  The family said to try again.

Made this for my work and my family.  In the one for my work, I used the applesauce I made from this site.  It came out fabulous.  The second one I made with store bought unsweetened applesauce, it came out too sweet.
