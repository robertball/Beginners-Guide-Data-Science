I found this recipe about 15 years ago on an unknown website.  This is a wonderful Pakistani Keema.  I make it each time I have leftover roast beef.  In fact, I purposely make to much roast so that we can have this dish!   I've never made it with the ground beef as others have suggested, but I have made it  with ground lamb.  One way I deviate from this recipe, is to double the ingredients and add extra spices to make the dish more suitable to our taste.    I serve it with boiled basmati or jasmine rice and my sides are Asmaâ€™s choice, warm pitas, raita, and finely sliced onions laced with lemon juice.    Leftovers are even better for lunch the next day. This dish is FANTASTIC!

I agree with many of the other reviewers that the ingredient need to be increase especially the spices. What i find a little strange is that the spices are added to the meat and water when in fact in Indian cooking spices a fried briefly to release their flavours. I therefore added them to the onions just before adding the meat which i also fried briefly. All in all this is a simple, quick and tasty meal. I served it with a little Basmati Rice, Naan bread, Lettuce with a spoon of Raita on top.

I made this with ground beef. I'm giving it three stars because, made as written, I would think this would be an incredibly bland dish. I added the seasonings to personal taste, and it turned out great. Served over basmati rice. Thanks, Asma!

This was absolutely delicious.  It tasted even better than it smelled whilst cooking!  I've even made it with turkey mince to great results.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Being of Indian decent, I thought it was unusual to see these spices in a beef dish (we didn't grow up eating beef in our house for the sake of Hindu family members).  So I had to give it a try!  Glad I did.  The flavors are much more subtle than I'm used to, but I liked the overall result. Very easy dish.  I didn't have tomatoes, so tossed in about 1/4 cup picante sauce instead. Also, used very lean ground beef (4% fat) and reduced the amount of oil to 2 TBSP.  It would've been too greasy otherwise (but I have noticed that food from Pakistani restaurants is very oily, so that might be a cultural preference).  For anyone who can't find the spices in their area, you may order them online from Penzeys.com.  I've been using them for years--the quality of spices is excellent, and they can be cheaper than the local grocery store.

We need to develop a better name for this recipe because the current title doesn't do it justice. For someone like myself who likes spices (yes, I also increased the amount of spices used) and wants to increase protein intake, this is a wonderful dish. The cumin, the heat of the chili powder and chilies, and the aroma of the garam masala really blend and flavor the beef well. The only reason I didn't give the recipe 5 stars is because this is essentially a bowl of beef. As Asma suggested, warm up some pita bread, make the raita (fyi: for those unfamiliar with Middle Eastern cooking, she means plain yogurt - not vanilla!), etc. I purposely double the dish, so that I can take any leftovers for lunch where I serve the meat on top of lettuce, additional tomatoes and a light vinaigrette (sometimes just additional lemon juice, but usually a bit of oil and vinegar.) Delicious.

Very tasty, but a bit too greasy for my taste.  I would advocate caution in adding the first 1\4 cup of water.  My oil was too hot and we had a very exciting few minutes of hot spitting fat!  We will definitely make this again, but would probably only use 1 or 2 tablespoons of oil.  Even using lean beef mince a lot of extra oil is generated.    We served this with rice, stir fried swiss chard (with garlic and soy sauce) and the Easy Chickpea Curry on site.  Great supper - thank you!

This was really easy to make, I found the lemon and cilantro really added an excellent flavour. Overall quite a good dish, mine was a little dry. We liked it but not loved it.

Man was this gooood! Unfortunately, my grocery didn't carry exactly what the recipe called for - Garam spice and Black Eyed beans. Had to substitute Garam paste and Fava beans. Nevertheless, the dish was wonderful! I got Nan bread instead of pita and dipped it in the mixture of natural yogurt, salt & pepper, cumin and diced green chile - Wow - what a taste!

This was pretty good. I didn't put any meat in it, subbed dried cilantro and used anaheim pepper. However, I sauteed the pepper, onion and garlic together, then added the tomato, beans and spices (including the garam masala). Then I stirred in 3/4 cup of white basmati rice, 1 1/2 cups water, brought to a boil, then simmered everything covered for 20 minutes, adding the lemon juice at the end. It was really easy, and pretty good. I'm sure it's good with the beef too.

Not to spicy, but has a good flavor to it.  We pervert it by making it almost into a mexican meal and by using ground beef.  I know, heresy.  Great recipe and is very easy to make.

Made exactly as written, but omitted the garam masala as it's hard to find and added a small dash of ground cinnamon instead. It was fantastic! Will definitely make again

Doubled up on the spices and it was really good. I used a van of diced tomatoes because I did not have any fresh ones. SautÃ©ed the onions with the garlic and the spices. Placed can of tomatoes and continued to cook through a little bit more. Added half a lemon juiced. Added beef. Boiled my black-eyed peas in my rice cooker and added them when they were almost cooked. Cooked further under low heat. Served with rice. Good meal

This was interesting. Seemed odd to do Indian food with beef, but I tried it out of curiousity. Needs more of the spices I doubled everything at least (and maybe even more on cumin, garam masala and salt. Served over rice. Will make again.

This was good, I liked it. I ,however, am far more heavy handed with the spices and added considerably more(can't say how much I tend to eyeball rather than measure). And I guess I didn't realize until now how much I changed it too. I usually keep Ginger-Garlic Paste and Green Chili Paste on hand so I used that. I use cayenne in place of chili powder always. I ALWAYS have Nigerian Tomato Stew so used that in place of tomato sauce (this is really great for everything, if you haven't tried it-allnigerianrecipes.com-oh and a tip, use less diced onions in a recipe you add it to since the sauteed onions can make it sweeter). Also added spinach. I was out of riata but that would definitely have been very good with this. Possibly may have added mango powder but i couldn't remember. Definitely remember adding coriander.

I actually added the cumin to the oil and onion and fried if off as usual when I make Indian. I only had cumin seeds so they had to be done like this. Also omitted the chilli and cilantro as I had neither in the kitchen; instead I added a good teaspoon of Brown Sugar near the end as I found it a little bitter from the Tumeric. It was very nice - I was only looking to cook the beans and needed a recipe. This works. Not my favorite yet but worth it as all the fiber in this dish is sure to be welcomed also.
