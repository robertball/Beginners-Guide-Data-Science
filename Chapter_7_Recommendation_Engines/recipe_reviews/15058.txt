This was the first cheesecake I've ever made, and it turned out great.  I find that if you melt all of the chocolate chips and beat them into the batter, the cake turns out much creamier, smoother, and with a more even, pleasing, delicious taste, and it looks better as well.  With the chocolate chips, they turn into hard crunchy chocolate pieces once the cake is cool, but if you melt and mix them the cake is completely creamy and has a better flavor.  It did have a few cracks in it, but those might be eliminated by placing the springform pan in a roasting pan of boiling water while it bakes.

This was an excellent cheesecake, and a huge hit at my family reunion yesterday.  It was gone before I knew it!  I did make a few modifications: used chocolate graham crackers(crushed) mixed with some oreo crumbs for the crust(no need for cocoa). I also added about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips into the batter-1/3 didn't seem like enough. Using fat free condensed milk & 1/3 reduced fat cheese worked amazingly to save on fat & calories.  This will be made again for the holidays!  Thank you for a good recipe!

Hi guys, Jessica here, and this is my recipe I submitted several years ago, and I'm still making cheesecakes. Just wanted you folks to know, leave the cocoa out of the crust, and omit the chocolate chips, and this is a great basic cheesecake recipe from which many variations can be made. My current favourite variation: replace graham cracker crumbs with crushed shortbread, omit cocoa, add zest of one lemon to the batter, and swirl melted seedless raspberry jam on the top with a toothpick prior to baking. Tomorrow I'm going to try adding lime zest to the batter and topping the baked, cooled cake with a layer of store-bought key lime curd. The possibilities are countless! I'm so glad many of you enjoy the recipe!

I added three tablespoons of sour cream to the cream cheese mixture.  Next time, I will sprinkle more chips in the batter.

I have been using this for over 20 years. It never fails me, perfect everytime! This is New York Style cheesecake (thick) not like Italian style which is creamy. Note: Coating the chips in flour makes no difference as far as sinking to the bottom so don't waste your time doing that. I use crushed chocolate cookies for the crust and it's yummy. Of course you can use plain graham cracker for the crust, omit the choc chips and top with fruit for an alternative. EITHER WAY, THIS IS THE ONLY CHEESECAKE RECIPE YOU WILL EVER NEED! 5 STARS!

A great cheesecake recipe any cook should have. I prefer a little tartness to my cheesecake, but this is perfect for those that want a smooth and creamy texture and a traditional taste. By the way, it doesn't matter what you do to the chocolate chips, they're going to sink to the bottom. Also, I strongly suggest baking this in a water bath - set the cheesecake pan in a larger pan that has water in it. That's the only way to bake anything that has a cheesecake/custardlike texture. If you don't, it'll crack and can dry out. Follow the baking directions to a T and you should be fine. Use an oven thermometer because all ovens vary. You should have a flawless looking cheesecake you'd be proud to serve to anyone.

delectable....i have finally conquered how to make cheesecake....and this one came out really yummy....very rich....

for those who said it was too thick or dry i would suggest shortening the cooking time up a bit...that was my biggest mistake learning how to do cheesecakes....and try cooking it in a water bath....

You gotta love it when a plan comes together! This was my first attempt at this recipe and other than a minor crack (which was mostly hidden by the chips) it came out perfect. Served on New Years Day 2011, it was well recieved. No wonder. The condensed milk makes this cheesecake special. It has my seal of approval, give it a try.

Wonderful recipe!!!  I will make this again at any dinner I attend!  Make sure to press your crust thin and far up the sides of the pan.  This is a chocolate lovers delight!  Very easy to make, just follow the directions to a "T".

i have been using this cheesecake recipe since i found it here in allrecipes four years ago and it's always a HIT.  not only have i found that if you use miniature chips, they do not sink, but you can also use this recipe and change it up a bit as well.  i have omitted chocolate chips and made this with an oreo crust and swirled melted seedless raspberry jam in the prepared mixture before baking, and then made a topping of white chocolate ganache.  i have melted the chocolate chips directly in to the batter while mixing to make a rich chocolate cheesecake...   wonderful recipe and so versatile.  the trick to no cracks is to not open the oven door in the entire 2 hour process, and to place a pan of water in the oven while baking.  i will make this again and again and again.  wonderful and perfect for extravagant-looking gifts!

This is a great starter recipe! I didn't put the cocoa in the crust. But I did make the batter then split it in two. I added the cocoa and melter chocolate chips to one batter and left the other plain. I then added both to the crust for a 1/2 and 1/2 cheesecake! It turned out so cool and tasted great! A keeper!

This was the very first time I have made a "from scratch" cheesecake.  I made it for my husband's birthday and took it to the office. All of his coworkers LOVED it!  I thought it had enough chocolate chips and mine didn't turn out too done at all (as stated in a previous review) -- it turned out just perfect.  I actually didn't have a 9" pan, so I used my 10" and it worked with the same cooking times.  This is an easy recipe to make (as long as you have a mixer)!  I'll definetly use it again.  THANK YOU!

This was so easy and so delicious.  The only thing I did different was I added the 1 cup of mini chocolate chips to the mixture, then sprinkled some more on top.  A  true chocolate lovers delight!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I'm really not much of a baker, but when I saw how simple this recipe looked, I decided to give it a try for my sister's birthday. My husband, who wasn't planning on eating any, had 2 pieces, and my sister said that it was the best cheesecake she's ever had! I used a water bath and added a few more chocolate chips just because. My brother-in-law gave it 5 stars for presentation.

Very excellent! I've made this recipe before (in my pre-AR days), and was happy to find it here. Easy as pie, but way yummier! Warmed ingredients to room temp, which made a nice smooth consistency, followed directions to a T. Thanks!

This is absolutely the best, easiest cheesecake recipe I've ever used!  I use it all the time.  It's even good to use as a base.  I've substituted chocolate chips with blueberries, strawberryies and cherries and it still comes out great everytime!  I recommend this recipe to everyone. Since I've been making this recipe for over a year now I've made a few changes.  I add 3/4c of sugar and 2/3c of sour cream and 2 egg yolks for a denser richer cheesecake.

Out of 5 possible Stars this recipe should get 100! Fantastic! This is the first cheesecake I've ever made. I made the cheesecake, put it in the oven for the hour, then shut the oven off. Since it was midnight, I asked my daughter to take it out of the oven after an hour... So of course I got up the next morning and found it still in the oven! Guess what! IT WAS STILL FANTASTIC!! (not a bad first cheesecake for a single dad)

I have never made a cheesecake before, and I'm sad this is my first one...because it's all downhill from here! I couldn't believe I made this! AND it was so easy! I did add more of the mini chips than it said to the batter, but I like chocolate! So, so yummy!Very creamy and sweet.

This was a really good recipe. I melted half the chocolate chips and put them in the batter and put the other half on top once I put it in the pan. I used chocolate Teddy Grahams for the crust and made a dark chocolate ganache and drizzled it on top. Turned out awesome and everyone loved it!

I'm not an experienced cheesecake maker, but I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday cake, and it was absolutely delicious.  A big hit, and so very easy!  I just made another one for Thanksgiving dinner....didn't even need to look at the recipe, as I remembered the ingredients in my head.  That's how easy it is!

i halved the recipe and made 24 mini cheesecakes using a mini muffin pan. baked for 20 min. came out awesome! i don't like tangy cheesecake unless its plain. this flavor is not tangy and goes great with the chocolate chips. can't wait to make again using variations by omitting cocoa and choc chips as suggested by jessica the author. thank you so much for a great recipe ;)

This was a fantastic cheesecake. Not too sweet and not too tart. It was perfect. I wasn't sure how the sweetened condensed milk would taste, but it made the cheesecake nice and creamy. I melted the chocolate chips and mixed it into the batter only because I wanted it to have a smooth texture. I placed a pan of hot water in the oven while it was baking and no cracks! I will definitely be making this again!

Made this recipe exactly as written.  The outcome was a creamy, rich cheesecake with no cracks on the top.  Love the chocolate chips in the cheesecake.  They just put this cheesecake over the top.  I also liked that the chocolate crust could be made with ingredients that I already had.  Many of them call for chocolate cookies, which I don't usually buy.  Great recipe that the entire family loved and devoured!

This was such an easy recipe and definitely delicious! I was very pleased and so were my guests!!  I added way more chocolate chips than required because you can never have too much chocolate, and it turned out great. I will definitely be making it again!! :)

Very good, the sweetened condensed milk really does it.  I get better reviews when I make it with a standard grahm cracker crust instead of a chocolate one though.

I didn't put the chips in the batter I melted them first and swirled it in. Also baked in water bath. Perfect Perfect Perfect!

This turned out great! I chopped up about 1.5 cups of dark chocolate into chunks. Because they were in various sizes, I did not use the flour to coat them. I did put about half of the chocolate into the batter and half on top. I think it baked just fine just on the oven rack, but it did have cracks on top-but like someone else said, they were pretty much covered up by the chocolate chunks. Someday I may try a water bath if I need a smooth top, but this worked great. I made it a day a head so it would have plenty of time to chill. Everyone LOVED it-we ate 2/3 in one day :P It was nice and thick and cream cheesy but chocolately too-a wonderful mix! I will definitely make this again :)

This recipe is very good.  I have made a lot of cheesecakes, never used sweetened condensed milk before.  Not sure if it added anything than other recipes I've used that has different ingredients.  It is very rich.  Very easy.  My only problem, though I did leave it in the oven for an additional hour, the top cracked deeply.  Other recipes that call for leaving the cake in the oven have not cracked like this one.  Thanks!

I recently made this and it turned out perfect! This will be my recipe for cheesecake from now on.  After reading the reviews, I made a few minor changes...I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, with butter and sugar - worked great! I also melted about 1 cup of good quality chocolate and mixed that in right at the end, allowing it to cool a bit first.  Then after puting it into the pan, I still sprinkled some mini choc. chips on top - mostly for presentation.  Don't peek in the oven - this trick really really works!  I baked it as directed, then turned the oven off for an hour and walked away.  Very tempting to look, but don't do it!  When the timer finally beeped, I was truly amazed to see that the top was smooth, beautiful - with NO CRACKS!  The cheesecake was dense, creamy and delicious! Thank you for this great recipe!

Mine cracked big time! I followed the recipe exactly, except melted the chocolate chips before putting them in the cheesecake. It was still  very moist and tastes delicious. Thankfully, I am not serving it to others, because it is not pretty. I placed water in a pan under the cheesecake. I don't own a pan big enought to create a waterbath for my spring form pan, but will make sure to get one. I think it would have made a huge difference! I'll definitely try it again!

This was ABSOLUTELY the best chocolate chip cheesecake ever!! My family has had a similar recipe that we have made for years but it does not even compare to this! This is awesome!! I accidentally added 1 cup of sugar to this and I wouldn't do it any different next time! It was rich but not too sweet at all. I also added a chocolate glaze like someone else mentioned. AWESOME!!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it came out a little dry which was very disappointing.  I will consider trying it again and reducing the cooking time.

Made this and took to a Christmas party this past weekend and everyone loved it. I did even use Neufchâtel cheese and fat free condensed milk and it turned out fine. Other than that followed the recipe exactly A keeper in my book!

This was a good recipe. I found it to be the perfect combination of light and creamy - unlike other reviewers who found it too dense. I hand-whipped mine - that may have made it lighter.

I do think that it makes for a beautiful presentation - and will garner loads of compliments.

Very good! I used 2 packages of reduced fat cream cheese and 1 package of regular cream cheese.  Also, I used reduced fat condensed milk.  Instead of 1 cup of chocolate chips, I used about 1 1/2 cups. Turned out very well!

i made this cheesecake for a valentines dinner and it was really good. it was hard to believe that i made it at home because it looked so good and it had just the right consistency. i like my cheesecakes really dense and smooth, not creamy like the jello no-bake cheesecakes. this one had the perfect consistency and looks pretty professional.  everyone loved it, they couldn't even tell i accidentally left the sugar out of the crust......oops

Very easy and delicious recipe. I've made it twice now and didn't need to use a water bath to avoid it from cracking.  The appearance of it is great.  Everyone loved it!  Several comments saying it tasted like it came from the Cheesecake Factory.  I did make one change to save time:  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust to avoid adding in cocoa powder.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I've tried many cheesecake recipes from this site and this is one of my all time favorites. I use chocolate oreo crumbs for the crust.(I can only find them at Meijer's) I even use this as a base recipe and change the stir-in's. I made a snickers cheesecake using this recipe. I think the sweetened condensed milk might be the key ingredient. It gives the cheesecake a sheen and is so creamy. Thanks Jessica

My friend told me this was the best cheesecake she ever had, and to be honest, I'd have to put it right up there with any restaurant cheesecake I've ever had! It was awesome and really easy! The only thing I changed is that I mixed more (about half) of the chocolate chips with the flour and mixed them in with the batter, then put the rest on top. It was nicely sprinkled with chips throughout -they didn't even sink! Also, I didn't have regular graham crackers, so I used chocolate ones and it was great, even with the extra cocoa powder and sugar. I will make this all the time!

Delicious cheesecake and so easy to make!  I tweaked crust recipe a little:  use 1 cup graham cracker crumbs, 1 cup toasted pecans, 1/3 melted butter, 2 tablespoons white sugar.  Good with chocolate chips but good plain too, topped with strawberry supreme topping (see this cite for recipe).  Will be making again!

This cheesecake was awesome! Very creamy. Very rich..and it looked really appealing as well. I substituted chocolate graham crackers for the kind listed and then omitted the cocoa. It was delicious! I was a bit nervous about turning off the oven for one hour, but it came out perfect. I had trouble getting the cracker crumbs up the sides too but the cake did not stick to the sides at all. Everyone wanted the recipe! Thanks for a great cheesecake!

I have made this one several times and every time I do friends rave over it. This is one thing I always buy the best for. Tried to skimp one time and buy store brand chocolate chips and cream cheese, it just wasn't the same... Will only put the best in my cheesecake from now on....Philadelphia and Ghirardelli all the way!

This was my first try EVER and I was certainly very concerned since I was making it for my husband's 40th birthday. I made it the day before and put it in the fridge and we were so excited to taste it after dinner becuz it was So beautiful (I didn't get the cracks like others mentioned). Well, it was so worth the wait, it was SO delicious and thick and rich, I couldn't believe the "I" made it and it wasn't purchased from some fancy bakery downtown. lol
I will say, I looked at all the pictures and read the reviews and made sure to add more chips than in the recipe, but now looking back, I wished we had put less so we could have had more of the cheesy goodness and it not being so packed with chips inside as well as on top. Trust me, it was still divine. I think it had to be the sweet condensed milk, and I actually beat my eggs one at a time and let my cheese and eggs sit at room temperature. I think this will be THE Cheesecake recipe I will ever need. ENJOY!!

Great recipe, had it for our Easter dessert.  Everybody loved it.  Will try it with chocolate drizzled over the top next time, just to make it prettier.

Turns out real good, but NOT a cheesecake taste at all. Actually it really did not taste cheescake-y at all - will not make again. Very disappointed.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and it was gobbled up (pun intended!) by all in attendance. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. It's delicious and a real crowd-pleaser. I'll definitely make this one again!

The sweetened condensed milk gives this cheesecake a carmel-y flavor.  I made it for a birthday cake and everyone loved it.  Flour coating the chocolate chips worked perfectly to prevent them from sinking.

Really good!!! I  changed a few things but still utilized most of the ingredients.  I melted the 1 1/3 cup chocolate chips in the sweetened condensed milk and added that to the cream cheese. I also used 1/3 less fat for one of the cream cheeses, and used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites.  Received rave reviews at the tailgate. Will definitely make this a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!!!!

I was disappointed with this recipe. From the excellent reviews, I expected it to taste better. Here are my opinions.  - Crust was a little too overpowering for me. Next time I will stick to a pure graham cracker crust.  - The top looked brown to me and not very pretty. I'm wondering if cooking it an hour is too long.  If I make this again, I would try 45 minutes instead.   - It too heavy and not sweet enough for my taste. I thought the flavor was very blah.   While I did not love it, some other people who tried it really liked it. However, they prefer cheesecakes that are not very sweet.  If you have more of a sweet tooth, I would suggest looking for a different recipe.

This was pretty good but I made a few changes. I used chocolate graham crackers, 1 heaping tablespoon of cocoa and about 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter for the crust. I baked the crust for 7-8 minutes so it wouldn't get soggy later on.

To the actual cheesecake, I used a good deal more vanilla (2 tablespoons?) and also split a vanilla bean I had on hand and added the seeds of that. I only used 3/4 of the can of condensed milk because it seemed it would overpower the cream cheese flavor otherwise. I also thought it tasted a bit bland so I added 1/2 cup white sugar. The main difference was that I used a full cup of mini chocolate chips in the cheesecake itself, and only 1/4 cup for the top of the cake. I then added 1/2 cup sour cream to compensate for the sugar, extra chips and smaller amount of condensed milk. It turned out wonderfully.

This is a very creamy,thick, and delicious cheesecake. This was my first attempt EVER at making cheesecake, and I was so happy with the results. Everyone was really impressed! The only suggestion I would make is to add more butter to the crust. It did not want to go up the sides and was really crumbly. I did put a pan of water in the lower rack when baking also, and no cracks appeared. I followed the directions exactly. Thanks for the wonderful cheesecake recipe!! I will use it often!

This cheesecake was extremely easy to make.  Instead of graham crackers and cocoa, I just used crushed chocolate wafers...simple.  I did bake it in a water bath and when I cut into the cake, it was the perfect consistency...every piece cut looked like it was being served at a restaurant.  Served it with drizzled caramel...must make it over again and again.

I made a few changes using 2 packages of light cream cheese and 1 fat free cream cheese, egg substitute, fat free sweetened condensed milk, and used splenda instead of white sugar in the crust. It turned out great!

WOW!  Ok...let me just say THANK YOU JESSICA!!!   I have tried A LOT of cheesecake recipes and the problem I had was that there were too many extra steps that lead to a running center and a lot of cracks!  From using water baths to using a variety of ingredients - they NEVER turned out!  I decided to give this one a try and was amazed at the simplicity of ingredients as well as the directions.  The one thing you do need is the time.  I made this at night and then set it overnight in the fridge....It came out PERFECT!  I didn't have chocolate chips - so I made it plain and it tastes sooo good!  I am a cheesecake fanatic and will be making this from now on!!!   You can also use this as a base recipe to create all different flavor combos as well.  There is no limit.

This was my first cheesecake - and I didn't want chocolate but I only had 3 packages of cream cheese and this was the only recipe I could find that used 3 instead of 4 cream cheese.  So I gave this a try, omitting the cocoa and the chocolate chips. I otherwise followed instructions exactly and it turned out great.  I beat the heck out of the cream cheese before adding any other ingredients.  I topped the cheesecake with the blueberry topping left over from the "overnight blueberry french toast" submitted by karan1946.  Delicious!  I should note that during the refrigeration a crack did form across the top but this wasn't a problem for me. This might be caused by me placing in the fridge before it had completely cooled to room temp...not sure.

This is the second time I made this cheesecake for thanksgiving. I use to make a pumpkin one by Betty Crocker. Thought I would mix it up last year. I will never go back to the other one. It had so many steps and took 4 1/2 hours to make. This one was so simple but yet so wonderful.

Made this recipe last year for the annual holiday party at the office,and received many compliments on it!! However,because I don't like using Graham cracker or cookie crumbs,I make the crust with brownie mix!  I think the brownie crust adds stability.  Also,I found that the condensed milk prevented the cheese from cracking,as I've experienced in previous cakes.

If possible I'd rate this 6 stars! I myself am not a cheesecake lover but everyone who had a piece of this cheesecake raved about it. I even made one for my husband to take to work for his work buddies to enjoy and my husband had multiple persons ask if I would make and sell them. No joke. Matter a fact today I'm making one to share with my grandma because she's heard about my chocolate chip cheesecake ;)

I did add more chips to the batter and added some to the crust. Wow it was fantastic.  I used a pan of hot water on the rack under the cheesecake. It did not crack.  It was beautiful. I am making a dark chocolate and white chocolate next.  I did add allot of chips on top too. I didn't  do the flour trick and they did not sink to the bottom. This looked like a cheesecake from a bakery.  Happy Cheesecaking y`all!!!!

I made this cheesecake for my husband and he loved it.  We are not big dessert eaters but will make an exception for this!  the only thing I changed was the size, I made it 4 servings smaller and it turned out great! I used a water bath, it seems to eliminate cracking.

There is absolutely no way that this cake could possibly be cooked after 1 hr at 300 degrees. At that point, it was still VERY wet, barely cooked and not browned at all. I ended up having to cook it for another HOUR, then left it in the oven for 1 1/2 hrs, and it was finally set. If you are going to make this  - it needs to bake for TWO HOURS, not one. Otherwise, increase the temperature.

I tried this recipe today and the cheesecake tastes fantastic! I didn't have graham crackers so I used crushed shortbread cookies.

Served it for after Thanksgiving dessert. It was awesome. I added peanut butter cups(minis) between the crust and the filling because my son wanted peanut butter cheesecake. Everyone really enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this cake many times and it is always great. It is my husbands favorite. I have noticed the cake does better with the larger chocolate chips. The small chips sink no-matter the amount of flour I use. Either way it is still a great cake. No complaints from any of the taste testers!

Rich, thick & creamy, and delicious! All you really need is a couple bites of this dessert! I made half of mine into cheesecake pops - which tasted and looked great, but were a lot of work (it was hard to form into balls) which is why I only made half of them into cheesecake pops. I don't have a springform pan either so I just made it in another pan I had and that worked just fine for me. Yum.

FANTASTIC cheesecake recipe!  For the first time since I started making cheesecakes, this one did not crack.  It was rich in flavor and texture, so if you like a dense cheesecake as opposed to a fluffy one, this is for you.

I just made this cake for my father in law and it was delicious! It was my first time making a cheesecake so I was a bit nervous... but my cake didn't crack at all and came out creamy and moist. I followed the directions except that I melted 3/4 cups of the chocolate chips with 1 tbsp of butter in the microwave and mixed it in with the cream cheese and condensed milk. The melted chocolate made a "marble look" which was cool. I then sprinkled the remaining chocolate chips on the top of the cake batter once it was in the pan. I did put my spring pan in another pan (just a larger plain cake pan) and added about 1/2 inch of boiling water and baked for one hour... then cooled in the oven for one hour. Sounded difficult at first but ended up not being too bad.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever had.  It's really dense and heavy - not like the Sara Lee cheesecake at all.  You don't need to coat the chocolate chips with flour, i never had a problem with them sinking.  No changes need to be made!!

This was yummy, but not over-the-top exceptional.  I used for the crust, crushed chocolate teddy graham-type crackers with the butter, no added sugar or cocoa.  All else was followed exactly & was my first cheesecake ever.  Enjoyed by all, but I'll keep searching for a WOW recipe.

"I just tried this chocolate chip cheesecake receipe and it is divine!! It is by far the best cheesecake I have ever made and that I have ever had! Luv luv luv it!! If I could I would give it more stars! I never thought to use sweetened condensed milk in my cheesecake and now I will never not use it. It gives it such a creaminess.

Everyone loved this cheesecake.  I used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips mixing some in the batter and then sprinkling the rest on top.  I did not toss them in flour yet the ones sprinkled on top stayed there.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it turned out well.  Instead of chocolate chips, I used toffee chips and Splenda instead of white sugar.  My wife and I enjoyed it very much and I will be making it for Superbowl Sunday.

I wanted to experiment with this cake because if it came out good I wanted to make it for Christmas. I made it without the chocolate chips and coco and it was awesome. It is very versatile and yummy. I like that there is no lemon in it.  I am going to make it today for Christmas day w/ the chocolate since it is our duty to bring the chocolate dessert for family get togethers. I know it will be great!!!

This was a fantastic recipe. The crust was labor intensive because it was the first crust I have ever made. I added sugar to the cream cheese, and used far less chips. Then I made a chocolate sauce to drizzle on top, after it cooled. The cheesecake is so delicious that I will make this one again for my family this Christmas.

I didn't have any graham crackers so I crushed up 2/3 of a package of oreos with melted butter and made the crust. Then I put the remaining 1/3 of a package into the cream cheese mixture. It was DELICIOUS!!

The first time I ever made cheesecake I vowed I would never again because it was so time-consuming and it turned out looking horrible (although it did taste pretty good).  I decided to give this recipe a shot though, and I'm glad that I did!  It was pretty easy and turned out really good!

I recently started baking and this was my very first cake. I have now made this cheesecake 3 times. Each time it tastes better and better! My family has raved about this cake and it will now be a staple at every holiday dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and even used Philadelphia Cream Cheese 1/3 the fat. I make it the day before and refrigerate until ready to serve. Amazing recipe!

yum  but we want to change a few things--a little more graham crackers for the sides and use more of the chocolate chips in the inside of the cake. But very good!

I had to make this cake twice, since my first attempt wasn't entirely successful: the cake browned too much on the sides, sank and cracked. This gave me the opportunity to taste it before serving - the filling tasted great, but the taste of coco powder in the crust was a bit overpowering. For my second cake, I added half of coco powder, which tasted much better (still very chocolaty).   To improve the looks of my second cake, I bought stove thermometer, which reviled that the temperature inside the stove was 25 degrees higher than it was saying, so I baked on 285 (exactly 300 inside).   I also used water bath, first wrapping spring form in turkey baking bag and then placing it in the foil 10-inch tray and then pouring warm water in the baking tray. It turned out perfectly smooth and white the second time!

My boss loves cheesecake, so for his birthday I decided to make this recipe.  He said no words could describe how yummy this cheesecake was!  It was very easy.  I did put it in a water bath while it was baking and NO CRACKS!!!  I did have to use regular sized chocolate chips but it turned out just fine!!!

I'm now convinced that a lot of bakeries and resturants use sweetened condensed milk in their cheesecakes rather than sour cream, because this tasted like something I'd pay $5.00 a slice for at the end of a special meal out.  My family is already asking when I'll make it again.

This was a great cheesecake!  I loved the crust and the cheesecake was not too sweet-nice and creamy texture.  I brought leftovers to work today otherwise I would be eating it everyday until it was gone-not exactly good for the hips!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the recipe that I have been using for almost 20 years.  The only difference is I now make the crust with crushed double stuff oreos and a little melted butter.  Yum.

I changed a few ingredients -- used low-fat graham crackers, fat-free cream cheese and condensed milk -- and cut the cake into 16 slices instead of 12. That brought the calorie count per slice down to 322 - and no one could tell it was "low-calorie!" I love, love, *love* this cake. My co-workers are always asking when I'll be making it again! Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe many times.  It's excellent.  This time I used "Sugar in the Raw" in place of white sugar in the crust.  It gave it a very slight crunch that we really liked!  I used a shallow pan of water in the oven as I baked the cheesecake - no cracks!

Given the simplicity of the recipe and ingredients, I'm rating it 5 stars. This is a great cheesecake. It was very simply and quick to put together, and it came out fabulous. I melted a 6 oz. bag of chocolate chips and added it to the batter. I made no other changes,following all instructions exactly, and I did sprinkle some mini chips on top for garnish before cooking.

The cake was very silky, smooth, and dense. It was heavy like a New York cheesecake, but not as crumbly. I had a little trouble getting the crust to go up the sides of the pan, but it actually came out fine after baking with good flavor and consistency. I might add a little more butter to it next time so I can get the sides higher.

I didn't do a water bath, but I did put a pan of water on the lower rack to add moisture to the oven. 

I plan to try this again without chocolate next time, as a plain cheesecake with fruit on top. I think it's a good base recipe that you can modify with different flavorings. I'll bet melted white chocolate would also be good.

I will definitely make this again. I love making cheesecake and collect recipes for them, so this won't be the only one I'll ever make--I'm too much of a cheesecake junkie for that! But this one certainly deserves a place of honor and I'd also recommend it to anyone who hasn't made cheesecake before. It's easy and I think a forgiving recipe to the novice.

We love this recipe.  My 17 year old daughter has made it twice already and it was a carefree, simple recipe.  The cheesecake did not crack at all.  It gave a lovely presentation. I highly recommend this recipe.

Started a new diet but REALLY wanted cheesecake.  I used egg beaters instead of the whole eggs, light butter in place of butter, fat free cream cheese in place of the regular cream cheese and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  I also used oreo crumbs and omitted the sugar and cocoa powder.  I used mini oreos in place of the chocolate chips.
My kids who would never go near cheesecake couldn't get enough of it.  Hubby is gonna try it later tonight
YUMMY!!!!

Although I didn't have a slice, I made this cheesecake for a friend and she said, "It's like sex on a plate!". She said the crust tasted like a cookie, and the cheesecake turned out like NY-style... crumbly and delicious.

This was my first time making a cheesecake and it was an OK cheesecake. There wasnt enough chocolate chips and when I left the cake in the oven to set, the cheesecake seemed to cook even more. So I was left with dark edges and the next day it was a little hard. Maybe next time I wont let it sit in the oven and I'll add more chocolate chips.

Having tried three other cheesecake recipes, this one had a great flavor but came out too dense and heavy, in the future i might try adding flour and/or sour cream (as i saw in another recpe on this site)for a lighter consistency. The crust was great but needed more butter to help form the sides. No cracks, smooth top.

It was very good, although the crust had an overpowering cocoa taste. I had to add a little more butter to give the crust a good texture. I would make again with a few minor adjustments.

This was good and creamy.  I have never had a New York cheesecake so I can't compare it to that.  I used crushed chocolate graham cracker crumbs instead of cocoa for the crust.  Cooked it in a water bath and didn't have any cracks.  Thanks!

This certainly is a keeper.  It was both easy to make and it presented beautifully.  I think I will experiment using the cheesecake base and try different add-ins.  Can't see how I could go wrong~this cheesecake has a great backbone!

This was a great recipe - very dense with a nice chocolate flavor.  I could not press the crust up the sides of the springform pan on my first attempt. However, after upping the butter to 1 stick it performed perfectly and made for a great presentation. I also added 3/4 of the can of sweetened condensed milk to let the cheese flavor show through more.  After those adjustments, I recieved lots of compliments - people couldn't believe it was homemade.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I was rather disappointed with this recipe. I think although it had a great texture, the condensed milk really over-powered the cream cheese flavor. I'm not sure how to descibe it but it just didn't have that cheesecake flavor and seemed to be lacking something. It was ok but just not what I expected.

I onley gave this recipe a  4 star because it should be cooked in a water bath I made this cheese cake and the top started to crack, but is a easy cheese cake to make.
I will try another one to see maybe just my oven?

OMYGOSH...this is definitely the best cheesecake I've ever made. Thick and creamy and just the right flavour--not too sweet, but delectable. I used an 8-inch springform pan, which made it a bit thicker, so after an hour of baking I turned down the heat to 200 and let it bake for another 30 minutes. This cake definitely reaches its peak quality after it's been refrigerated overnight. Everyone enjoyed it and I will make it again for sure.

This was my first cheesecake and WOW..how wonderful it turned out!  My family could not get enough of it..and neither could I and I am not a big cheesecake fan! It was so so easy! I did put a casserole dish of hot water in the oven as it was cooking and cooling and guess what..not a single crack!!  This is a keeper!!

Easy and yummy!  I've also made this using chopped Oreo Cookies - using the orange filled cookies it was a hit at a costume party in October.  Another time I used a mixture of chocolate chips and peanut butter chips - another successful experiment.  This will be MY cheesecake recipe!

Absolutely delicious and so easy too.  The chocolate crust goes well with the miniature chocolate chips ... not overpowerlingly chocolate, like it should be.  In my opinion, this is the best cheesecake I've ever had, including eating at a restaurant.

This cake set well and was very dense.  I was afraid it would be too sweet because of the condensed milk, however, it wasn't and tasted great. I topped off the cake with swirls of cool whip and then sprinkled some mini chocolate chips on it.  There was not a bite left!!

This is a delicious cheesecake. My husband actually called me to say "thank you" for sending it with his lunch! I was a little curious about the 300 deg cooking temp, so I cooked it at 325 deg and it turned out just right. I also melted the chips and stirred them in. Loved it!

This was fabulous. I greased the spring foam pan and had no trouble removing the cheesecake. The crust only came up a little on the sides, but it was still great. The top didn't crack at all - I used my Kitchen-Aid mixer on the lowest setting. 
Thank you, Jessica.

tasted great!  This was my first cheesecake and everyone loved it.  I did use the chocolate graham crackers and next time I will leave out the cocoa...it didn't need it.  I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray and it came right out.  

I will make this again, it was really good!

Excellent recipe and makes a LARGE cheesecake.  Would offer one suggestion, to spray the bottom ONLY of the pan with non-stick spray.  I had a little trouble getting it loose from the bottom.  Another idea for chocolate lovers would be to melt the chips and swirl the chocolate into the batter after putting it in the pan. I may try the basic recipe without chips in other flavors.

I made this cheesecake twice. It is very good, it needs to set in the refrigerator overnight. The second time I made it I swirled homemade rasberry syrup in it. It became rasberry chocolate chip!

This is a really great recipe.  I did have trouble with the chocolate chips.  They did sink to the bottom.  I used regular chips next time I'll use mini.
I was shocked when the cheesecake turned out well! good

I'm the type of cook that has trouble boiling water. I have no natural talent for cooking and whatever I make has to be simple. Even I could not mess up this recipe. I have made it twice and it has been phenomenal both times. I didn't read the directions carefully and added all of the chocolate chips at once and it was no problem. I did use mini chocolate chips and coat them in flour and they did not sink to the bottom of the pan. I dumped all of the cake ingredients in the bowl at once and mixed with my 25 year old hand mixer and it was still delish. You can not go wrong with this.

It was a little bland to be honest. Followed recipe exactly, but used regular sized choc chips that I chopped up slightly first.  The consistency was very good, but it needed something to liven it up. Just tasted like baked cream cheese. Wouldn't make it again. I sent the leftovers to the firehouse with my brother-in-law, they probably weren't complaining.

I used a different recipe for the crust (cookie crumbs, butter, and sugar) which turned out great. My only complaint is my cheesecake caved in a bit even after sitting in the oven for that hour after baking. Very tasty though!

I followed the receipe.  My spring form pan was a 10 1/2 inch instead of a 9 in, so I opened the oven after 45 min instead of an hour.  I didnt want it to be dry.  I put parchment paper on the bottom of the pan and a ring of paper around the sides before adding the filling.  My final extra measure was putting a dish of water in the oven.  It turned out beautiful, creamy no cracks.  The chocolate chips were creamy, not hard, which I've had before and thought I didnt like choc chip cheesecake because of it.

I can't believe this came out perfectly and it was my first cheesecake.  Followed directions exactly as written.  No problems just a delicious cheesecake.

This is a very good,  very rich cake. When I make it again, and I will, I will use half the sugar and chocolate in the crust. Maybe add half a cup of ground pecans to the crust...

I have made many cheesecake recipes over the years. This one was super simple and turned out great! For the crust, I used "Oreo Thins" in the food processor in place of the graham cracker crumbs and cocoa powder. It was a huge hit with my family/friends! I will be making this again for sure!

Easy recipe!  My first time using my spring foam.  I would def make it again for a crowd.  I would have wanted it to be sweeter ~ so maybe a drizzle drizzle of warm caramel will do the trick;)

My first attempt at cheesecake, I was nervous since I’ve never done it before. The recipe is good, I’ve only made one change is that I used melted dove chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips, and mixed them into the batter. It came out great, super rich and tasty. I made it for my best friends bday, and everybody loved it! This recipe can feed up to 12 people! I crushed Oreo cookies and with a little bit of butter made them into crust. Actually very easy!

I just made this today and won’t be tasting it until tomorrow. It went together fairly easily (for a cheesecake), even though the crust might have needed just a tad more melted butter. It looks pretty.
I had to find a new recipe because the one I made two months ago had a different crust, but Dear Husband must have eaten the Oreo-style cookies required. We will see tomorrow whether this cheesecake disappears as fast as the last one.

Made this for my Birthday and it was a hit! I made it in a 10” pan and it turned out great. In the future I’ll drizzle some hot fudge as a garnish topper but it was perfect just the way it was.

This was exceptionally good! Everyone complimented me on it. I like that you don’t have to bake the crust then having wait for it to cool before you pour the batter into it but I had to add a bit more butter to get the crust to hold together.

This was a fabulous cheesecake, I only had one and a half pounds of cream cheese so the batter was a little runny but it still turned out perfect without a crack, and perfect colour too. I also did not use a springform pan as I didn't have one but I did everything the recipe said including the cooling process and then I removed the cake from the tin after chilling. 
The perfect cheesecake recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This cheese cake was delicious and so much easier to make than other cheesecake recipes I've prepared. I did use a different ingredient for the crust.  Instead of graham crackers I used Nabisco Famous Chocolate wafer cookies. I also omitted the sugar in order to avoid the cake becoming overly sweet. I crushed the whole package of cookies and added   3/4 of a stick of butter. After pressing it into the springform pan I had about a half a cup of crushed cookies left over.    Crust was baked in 325 degree oven for 8 minutes and cooled before adding the cheesecake batter.   I followed the rest of the recipe as stated.

There was so much crust that I divided it between (2) 8x8 square pans. I did as one reviewer said and melted the chips (1 cup) and added them to the batter. I baked it for the whole hour and left it in the oven to cool as said. The top was nearly burned, the edges were tall, the middle fell and cracked. After all that, it did taste good after thoroughly chilling it. I will add more melted chips to the batter and watch the baking more closely.

Absolutely delicious!!  I did not flour the chips and the mini chips did not sink. It's was beautiful as well as yummy. First time doing the water bath and it looked professional.

going to give it a 4 star because I haven't tasted it yet.  Just put it in the oven.  I am an experienced cheesecake baker and shy away from ANY recipe with Sweetened Condensed Milk due to the high sugar content .  I am diabetic and just don't use the regular stuff (recently found a recipe online to make my own sugar free  S.C.M. , haven't tried it yet as I am a busy dairy farmer)  Anyway, one of the best cheesecakes I ever made was a chocolate chip cheesecake that had orange zest in it, so I used this as my base and added the zest of an orange.  I will update after Sheboygan County Fair judging day as I have it entered in the baked cheesecake contest which I took first place in last year with a caramel apple cake cheesecake.

I made the recipe exactly as suggested.  I suspect it would have been quite good had it not come out overbaked, which made it dry and crumbly.  I understand it was a new york style cheesecake and there fore not as creamy as other kinds, but still if I could redo this recipe I would have taken it out at the first sign of browning on top, and not left it in the over for the extra "hour" after turning the oven off.  Would love to have tried it not over-baked.  Maybe someday I'll make it again...

This is a very good cheesecake.  I followed the directions exactly except I had no mini chips so I chopped some regular size chips.  I would make it again.

Best cheesecake recipe ever!!!

I just joined all recipes but this has been my cheesecake go to recipe for over  3 years now.  It's for a spring pan but you can actually make two regular sized pies from the recipe. 
I buy already made Oreo crust and make the chocolate chip pie and Graham crust for a cherry pie.   Comes out perfect every time and it tastes delicious!

I use this as a base for all of my cheesecakes! I just omit the chocolate chips for a plain cheesecake and then add toppings of my choosing. (I still love it with the chocolate chips though!)

Can I give this recipe 10 stars? It was fantastic and SUPER easy too – with the help of a stand mixer. I followed it exactly, except for not using cocoa in the crust. I kept it as regular graham cracker crust. I even bought already crumbled graham cracker crumbs and it was even easier! This was to die for. If you’re looking for a rich, traditionally thick NY cheesecake, I’d say this is right up there. One piece is plenty, unless later you want a midnight snack. The texture was great because it really reminded me of a restaurant quality cheesecake. We served it with chocolate syrup and fresh cut strawberries. No syrup needed at all – but the strawberries made it EVEN better! Really topped it off! I hope you try and enjoy!! I will definitely make this again and try variations. A+

Instead of chocolate chips, I folded an overflowing-pint of broken-into-pieces fresh blackberries into the cheesecake mixture, and baked it for 50 minutes in a 9x13 pan. Cut into bite-size squares, they were perfect for the party dessert I needed. They kept in the refrigerator very well, too.

THE VERY BEST cheesecake I have ever made!! My husband and his family LOVE this recipe and ask that I make it at every family gathering! I used the Ghirardelli brand of semi-sweet chocolate chips which gave it a smooth, creamy, and luscious chocolate flavor and texture! Do Not over bake!! 
5 Stars hands down!!!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!!

This cheesecake is amazing...and amazingly easy. I have made two cheesecakes prior to this (different recipes) and each required a bath for the cheesecake while it bakes. I was thrilled that this one doesn't! I added a ton more chocolate chips and am going to add raspberry puree to the batter next time I make it. My husband said this cheesecake was just as good as if it had come from a restaurant!

Everyone raves about this, and it's so easy to make. The recipe makes enough for two pre-prepared pie crusts. This is a good base for making other types of cheesecake as well. Sometimes I make one with the chocolate chips, and one without, but with a fruit topping, such as fresh fruit or canned pie filling.  The cheesecake is a little sweet, so I usually go with a more bitter or sour fruit. The cheesecake has a smooth finish (no cracks) with  little to no browning, so it always looks great.

Best enjoyed same day when the chocolate chips are not completely hardened. Still delicious afterwards but the hard chips take away from the creaminess of the cake.

I made this cheesecake without any changes, except for not adding the chocolate chips because I just wanted a plain cake.  It was not as dense as I would have liked, nor quite sweet enough for my taste.  It was a good cheesecake, just not to my personal liking.

EGGLESS version turned out superbly (used 1/4 tsp xanthan gum powder in 1/4 cup water per egg).

10/10 for this recipe, and 10/10 for xanthan gum powder.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever had. I've made it twice and both times it has been fantastic and flawless. I didn't put cocoa into the crust but it was still fine. I also set it out for 30 min. after taking it out of the oven before I put it in the fridge. :) Thank you so much! Best cheesecake ever.

Recipe very easy! I melted the chocolate chips and added to batter for chocolate cheesecake. I enclosed the springform pan in a crockpot liner to prevent seepage and then put that in a water bath. Crust is very yummy as is! Came out perfect. Everyone loved it!

This was delicious! Only thing to mention is to spray the springform well with a cooking spray, really let the cheesecake cool before putting it in the fridge, and allowing a sliced piece of cake  to sit at room temp for 10-15 mins before eating! It was delicious!

This recipe is awesome! That was my first attempt at cheesecake ever. I didn't  change any ingredients. Everyone loved it! I Made sure the crust  was spread thin with sides as high as I could. I placed the pan inside a shallow sheet pan with about a 1/3 inch of water in it. You will not be disappointed!

So easy and delicious.  Owned a springform pan for probably a decade before attempting to make a cheesecake!  This recipe is awesome as written, make sure you bake it in a "water bath"... shallow pan with a little water in it.  Everyone loves this thick, creamy NY style cheesecake.  Huge hit!  Try it!

I made this for valentine's day.  My husband said I should sell it to restaurants,  it was that good. My only problem was that it sunk, don't know why? I will be making this again and will be adding some orange zest, to add a little contrast to the sweetness.  It was delicious!

Just made this for my stepdaughter's 12th birthday, and it was beyond a success!  First time even attempting a cheesecake (or any cake) from scratch, and surprised even myself with how delicious it was! Only issue is now all my friends and family want me to make them one.

Hands down my favorite cheesecake that I have made. Absolutely delicious. Rich, perfect texture and consistency! I have found that the secret to any good cheesecake is to let it sit overnight in the refrigerator and do not remove the pan until ready to serve.

OMGoodness....I have made a few cheesecakes before, but this was my first time with this recipe. This will now be my "go-to" for any cheesecake. I followed instructions and no cracks...and it is so incredibly creamy and rich. My family loved it!  Thanks for sharing this one with all of us!

I followed this recipe exactly, only cut it in half to make cupcakes. I ended up getting 12 mini cupcakes and 12 normal size cupcakes from doing this. Only problem is that you end up with more batter than crust, so I had to make a full recipe of crust, with only half a recipe of batter. They taste delicious and I will definitely make them again!

I make this to give my brother-in-law almost every Christmas.  It's easy to make, very good and makes him very happy!  I gave it only four stars because it's not my favorite.  I'm sure my brother-in-law would give it five stars or more.

By far THE BEST cheesecake recipe I have ever made, and I have been making cheesecake for over 25 years!  I baked it using the water bath method which prevents the top of the cheesecake from cracking.  I served it on Christmas day and my family loved it, everyone agreed it was the best ever!Will most likely be making it again in early January for my husband's birthday, it is sooooo good!

I made this for my sister so I haven't tried it but this recipe is great! It is so easy to make. I followed it exactly and it came out great. There is one crack in the top but it doesn't matter, it's just gonna be eaten. It's not like I am gonna enter it into a contest. It looks delicious!! I know it's gotta taste great. I didn't have a problem with the chocolate chips sinking because they are the mini ones and since the batter is thicker than some of the other cheesecakes, they hold in the batter well. I am very please with this recipe. Thank you.

Very good, but a little too sweet from the condensed milk and chocolate chips. Still everyone liked it. The only other problem was that the chocolate chips were mostly at the top of the cake. I followed the tips of other reviewers but it still didn't stay down once the batter was poured in.

This cheesecake is pretty good.  I don't care too much for the flavor of the sweetened condensed milk, but it's not very strong.  

I baked this in a water bath.  Instead of wrapping the pan with foil, I place it inside a turkey roasting bag, this has worked out really well for me and I've never had water get in the bag.

This is by far one of the best cheesecakes I've eaten and I can't believe I made it! A friend called it "sublime"! The recipe is super easy. The only change I made was baking it in a water bath. I'm going to try making it with lemon juice/zest and a blueberry topping!

I have been making this recipe for many, many years. My boys grew up eating this and have asked for it many times.
Another thing to mention is to make sure that ingredients are at room temperature (it makes for a better cheesecake), and to prevent cracking make sure it is completely cool before refrigerating.

Other than no-bake, which I consider to be pudding, not cheesecake, this is the easiest cheesecake recipe I've ever tried.  And it turned out great!

I am a novice baker and this recipe was easy enough!  I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter and 1/2 on top, the other proportions just didn't look quite right.  WORD TO THE WISE: I don't know if this is a novice mistake or not but to save time I purchased a crust in a springform pan.  The taste was fine but this batter made WAY WAY WAY too much for a 9 inch springform.  It was fine since I just used the rest to make cheesecake cupcakes, but you may want to up the springform a size if trying this.  Very good recipe!!!!  Easy and delicious!

Didn't love this.  Found it too heavy and dense, we prefer a lighter texture. I think the condensed milk was the problem.

Wonderful cheesecake! I have made this recipe numerous times for family get-togethers and it has been a huge hit every time! I like mine to be very chocolaty so I put extra chips in but besides that I wouldn't change a single thing........... Warning: if you are planning on making this for a party I would suggest making an extra to hide in the fridge and save for later, cause you may not be able to get a piece with other people around, this goes in a flash!:D

This recipe was absolutely awesomely delicious! Even though it was time consuming, it was well worth it. I recommend that you let it refrigerate for at least 6 to 8 hours before you eat it so it can fully chill. Other than that, awesome recipe. We followed it exactly as is, and it turned out great! Definently will make it again!!!!! :)

This cheesecake was delicious!  I used 3 bars of low fat cream cheese as well as low fat graham crackers.  It turned out very well.

Disappointed.  The filling was good; flavorful and creamy but the crust was lacking.  I think either all graham cracker or the use of chocolate cookie crumbs would be preferable to adding cocoa to the graham. I MAY make it again with that change to see if the family likes it better.  They weren't terribly impressed.

Loved it!!!!  I made it for my husband's birthday dinner, and everyone couldn't stop talking about it. I did make one change, I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs , instead of the regular and the cocoa powder. Thanks for the recipe! I know that I will be making it again.

This is a keeper.  Just started making cheesecake from scratch and if you follow the directions, you can't go wrong.  Next time I'm going to try using crushed up oreo cookies instead of the chocolate chips.

This has been a huge hit each time I've made it. It is an excellent recipe, and you could easily leave out the chocolate chips and opt for a different type of cheesecake. I do use a water bath to avoid cracking.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever had!  I made it for my mothers birthday on New Years and everybody loved it!  I am not the most experienced cook and did have problems figuring out how to get the crust on the edges of the pan without falling to the bottom.  Also, it is best when refrigerated a day prior to serving. This was so good that a week later my teenager has asked for me to bake it for her birthday cake this weekend.

This was delicious and impressive-looking. The only thing was, it cracked in the middle while in the oven cooling for an hour. How can I prevent his from happening? Maybe I didn't blend the ingredients as good as I should have? I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't put as many chocolate chips on the top so it could look like the picture provided.

Excellent! I made this for an office christmas party and got rave reviews. My co-workers swore that I had bought the cheesecake and my boss told me I should make and sell them. Very easy to make. I did use 1/2 cup of chips mixed in and 1/2 cup on top and it turned out fine. Thanks for sharing!

This cheesecake is WONDERFUL!!!  I made per the recipe and would not change a thing.  The only thing I would do differently is to chill overnight.  By the time the cheesecake was fully cooled, enough to put in the refrigerator, I only had about 3 hours to chill before serving.  I used a stand mixer and it was quite creamy, I didn't think it was too dense at all.  As directed, I cooled in the oven and no cracks.

I made some adjustments. I used 2 bars of 1/3 fat cream cheese and 1 bar of regular cream cheese. I also used fat free condensed milk. I followed all the other instructions and the cheesecake turned out great. No crack and I didn't use a water bath! I did add more chocolate chips to the top (because I like chocolate chips) but in the mix you couldn't really see them mixed in. They did sink to the botton after tossing them in flour. Overall, a big hit with my coworkers.

This was the first time I had made Cheesecake from scratch. My first attempt failed completely. I took some advice and bought an oven thermometer. Come to find out my oven was 100 degrees hotter than what I was setting it on. No wonder my first cheesecake had burned. My second attempt was much better. I did use a water bath. The cheesecake did not crack and was very good. I get request for it pretty often!!

this is a nice recipe.. the only thing you must look out for is to bake it for 35 minutes not more.. i baked it for 45 and it was too much... if you put in water bath it makes cake moist..

This makes a dense, firm, not too sweet cheesecake.  I only gave it four stars because I prefer a creamier, more flavorful cheesecake and some of my guests did not love it. I didn't have any graham crackers, so just put it on a regular pie crust that I pressed into my springform pan and trimmed.  I'm sure it would be better with the chocolate crust.  But it looked beautiful and many people asked if I bought it.  I put a layer of melted peanut butter chips on the bottom, mixed extra mini chocolate chips into the batter, and splattered lots of both melted chips on top.  Overall a pretty and tasty cheesecake for those who love this texture.

This is a great and simple recipe. I used 2/3 lite cream cheese, a water bath and melted chocolate chips (except the chips on the top) like others have suggested. It tasted great and looked perfect. I didn't have enough time to leave it in the oven for an hour after cooking. I only left it for 30 minutes and then put it in the refrigerator. Not sure if it would have been better if I had but if you don't have time it certainly won't ruin it.

All I can say is 'wow'!  I never thought I would make a masterpiece like this and have it turn out absolutely perfect.  It looks like I went to an expensive bakery!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I would like to try variations of it, does anyone know if this is a possiblity?

This cheesecake was great!  I really didn't feel like making the crust, so I bought the premade graham cracker crust, and I bought a second premade one with Oreo cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great.  On one of them I put crushed oreos on top.  I let it sit in the oven overnight, because by the time it was finished cooking, it was 11 pm and I still had to leave it in the oven for another hour.  But even after letting it sit there for 6 hours, it still turned out great.  Also, I put one of them in a water bath, and the other wasn't in a water bath.  Both of them turned out fine, even the one without the water bath didn't crack.  I will definitely be making these again sometime.

MMMMMMMM! I made a regular graham cracker crust (without cocoa), but I followed everything else and it came out great! I didn't use a water bath, and it cracked, so I would definitely suggest that. Even though it wasn't my pretties dish, it tasted delicious and even my boyfriend who doesn't like cheesecake much loved it!

Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!  I used chocolate graham crackers and eliminated using cocoa for crust.  I put it in the refrigerator immediately after the hour with the oven off, and it worked beautifully, leaving it the springform pan until I cut and served it.  There were no cracks in the cheesecake.

Excellent texture, taste, easy to make.  I was out of condensed milk, substitued:  1 and 1/8 dry skim milk powder  1/2 cup warm water  3/4 cup sugar  1/4 cup butter  1 tsp vanilla Placed the above in a saucepan on medium heat stirring occasionally until the sugar was dissolved. I also increased the chocolate chips to 1 1/2cups, stirring to melt in 1/3 cup of boiling water.  I added this when you add the choc. chips.  I also added choc. chips into the batter, and sprinkled some on top.  It was an absolute hit.  Thanks for this awesome recipe, my search for the ultimate chocolate cheese cake is now over!!

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made and it came out yummy!  I substituted toffee chips instead of the chocolate chips for a different variation.  I used a pan of water under the cheesecake and left it in the oven like the recipe suggested and there was no cracking.  I will definetely use this recipe again!

Havent tried this yet but I just wanted to say that so the cake wont crumble when you cut it and if your worried about presentation.. precut your cake sticking a sharp knife in hot water, dry it and slice the cake in half, clean, dip it in water again, dry and cut.. repeat until you have 12 or 16 pieces. then when everyone serves them selves a piece it wont crumble up and get all ugly :)
Im going to make this for christmas, and I hope it works.. I will rate it then :)
oh! almost forgot. its important you dont peak opening oven. just follow the temperature directions and leave it in the oven the extra hour without opening. that way it cools down gradually and this prevents sinking.

This is so good!  I love the chocolate crust vs the regular crust!  I actually didn't even follow the directions correctly... by accident!  I cooked it for an hour and took it out of the oven rather than turning off the oven and letting it sit in the oven for another hour... so I took it out and let it cool comletely, then put it in the fridge... even though I didn't follow it exactly... it was still so good!

I didn't have a springform pan at school so I just went out and bought two pre-made graham cracker crusts... It was delicious. :)
Definitely will make it again!

this recipe was very useful though its not very diferent to most of  cheesecake recipes.
I noticed it has sweetened condensed milk....well I usually do not add that ingredient!!! I think it makes it way to heavy and sweet, instead of that I used a cup and 1/4 of natural 0% fat sweetened with Splenda>>Yogurt, and added 3/4 of sugar to the mix...
I loved the cocoa powder in the crust,I don't use graham crakers, I use Maria cookies and i definitely think the amount of butter for the crust is perfect.
I also melted the chocolate chips!! :P
I did no have the chance to add the vanilla or the flour but I think it turned out just fine!! 
I followed many tricks from this page and i must add that the surface of the cake presented one small tiny little crack!! (very proud of myself :P)

This cheesecake ranks #1 for all of our birthday celebrations.  I like the thick crust, it bakes beautifully, and tastes better if you bake it the day before you need it.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. The crust was way to thick, the cheesecake was really heavy but not creamy and the condensed milk gave it a strange flavor. It might have turned out different if I used sugar instead of the condensed milk.

I have made this a few times and every time it turns out great. When I'm in a hurry or being lazy I just use the ready crust they sell at the store and it still comes out amazing. It's always a huge hit at family get togethers as it's not too sweet. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is my 3rd cheesecake recipe from this site and this is by far the best. Everytime my husband cut himself a piece he would always say how great it is and it is the best one I've ever made. It is so creamy & good a little piece goes a long way. Very easy to make. I made it exactly as stated. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

This cheesecake is not very pretty.  The top is very plastic looking and I had to run out to the store to buy some whipping cream to make it look more appetizing. I guess sweetened condensed milk does not belong in cheesecake in my purist opinion.  It tasted fine, but it is not the best cheesecake I have had.  Another review compared it to Cheesecake Factory which is not totally accurate.  It is very easy to make.

This cheesecake was a definite hit! I am a better cooker than a baker, and this was my first time making a cheesecake, so I followed the recipe to the "T". It turned out perfect and went very quick. I have many  requests to make another.

Very good!  Easy to make....Five stars all the way.  I have never attempted to make cheesecake before, but this turned out so good.  Now I don't have to pay $30.00 for one at the Cheesecake factory!  Thanks!!

This recipe was awesomely easy.
It didn't sink in the middle and no crack formed in the centre, even without the use of a water bath in the oven.
I used a larger than 9" springform (I think it was 12") so I increased the crust ingredients to 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup butter, sugar, and cocoa. It seemed to work well.
I turned off the oven after 50 minutes, but I doubt it made a huge difference. I was just worried about the cooking time on a larger surface area.
I also used all low fat cream cheese and partly skimmed condensed milk.
I wish I had a camera, it turned out really well. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you :).

This is awesome! I used the oreo crumbs for the crust and more butter. My oven runs hot so I did end up overcooking it. The flavour was still amazing and rich. I may use just a little less of the condensed milk, but I also used a full cup of chocoalte chips in the cake itself. This is definitley a cake I will make again and I am lactose intolerant.

I made this and unfortunately I'm not lactose tolerant so I sent it to work after I had about 3 pieces.  It is a great recipe and now I have someone who wants me to bake them a cheesecake after tasing this one!  Woohoo!!!  Thanks for sharing a real jewel of a dessert.

This cheesecake was so good.  I could hardly keep from eating the whole thing.  I did have a problem because the middle stayed soft.  But, I'm new to making cheesecakes so it's probably something I forgot.  
Thanks!

I made this cheesecake for my staff Christmas party and it was a huge hit!  When the cover was taken off, everyone "ooo'd and aaaah'd".  It tasted just as impressive!!  I was asked for the recipe several times.  I followed the recipe to the "t" and it turned out great.  Very rich and creamy texture.  A keeper!!

This recipe is delicious! The crust is a little thick for my taste, but other than that, it's brilliant! Whether it's for birthdays, holidays, or just a nice treat, I highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent cheesecake. I was worried after reading some of the other reviews that it wouldn't turn out well, but it's delicious! The only thing that didn't work for me was coating the chocolate chips in flour - the recipe says this prevents them from sinking to the bottom, but they still did. I have to agree with previous reviews that the crust is delicious, almost like a cookie. The cooking time worked out perfectly on this one. Finally, one of the people who had a piece actually said to me "You bought this cheesecake, right?" What better compliment can you get? I'll definitely make this again.

This was awesome!  Never made cheesecake before, but I read the reviews beforehand.  Melted the chocolate chips and added them that way.  Used some extra butter for the crust.  Sprinkled the top with a few chocolate chips.  Everybody I fed it to LOVED it!

This was terrific!!  I used crushed Oreos and brown sugar for the crust, but kept everything else as stated in the recipe.  It turned out beautiful - no cracks - and lovely presentation!  And the flavor/texture was simply excellent!  It was very well received amongst all the folks who ate it.  Many came back for seconds and thirds.  My husband has tried a ton of different cheesecakes I've made for him and agreed this was one of the very best!!  I was nervous to try it because of some of the marginal reviews, but don't let those fool you - this is superb!

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was just "okay". I agree with another reviewer that the sweetened condensed milk flavor overpowered everything else. The texture is very creamy but very heavy. The crust was yummy though.

Cooked it in a water bath and it turned out perfect. It didn't brown on the top or crack so I was afraid that it wasn't completely cooked but it was perfect.

I made this for the potluck @ work today, and I've received GREAT comments from my coworkers, my boss, her boss, and his boss.  I can't wait till my bf comes home to try the leftovers.  :)
One of my coworkers even said "You're hired!" after eating a slice.  :)  This is a Must Keep Recipe, and will definitely make it again.

This is the first scratch cheesecake my 8 yr-old and I ever made. It turned out beautifully. 

We followed the directions except we beat it by hand. 

It came out very thick and dense, thus the "12 servings" became 24 for us. It's not supersweet but a nice balance between the cheese taste and the chocolate. It is very rich. My kids normally don't like cheesecake and they ate this because it had just enough chocolate taste. 

As for presentation, it was a pretty cheesecake too. I'll make it for company. 

This is a keeper recipe for me.

I have tried better cheesecakes from this site, this was too dense and heavy, no one could eat a whole serving, next time i'll try the second version which has sour cream and a bit of flour to lighten it up. The crust was great, i did add some butter as recommended earlier. No cracks!, a nice shiny smooth top.

I had great success with the pumpkin cheesecake, but for some reason this didn't turn out as well.  My daughter helped me make this recipe so it's possible that we may not have followed the recipe exactly.

I made this for a holiday dessert party and it was by far the most popular dessert there.  I used oreos for the crust like other reviewers.  Really an attractive and delicious cheesecake that is not too time-consuming to make.

Very good recipe, but next time I will reduce the amount of sweetened condensed milk-- it seemed to overpower the cream cheese taste.  I will also add more butter to the crust to make it easier to press up the sides.

Thank you for such an amazingly easy and delicious recipe.  I've made lots of cheesecakes before, but this is by far the easiest to put together and the only one to recieve such rave reviews.  I did use Oreo cookie crumbs that I mixed with sugar and about 6 tblsp. melted butter. Perfect!!!!

What a delicious cheescake and SO easy to make. Mine did crack, only where the chocolate chips were, so it wasn't too obvious. But I don't care about the small cracks, because it still looked and tasted like something from a restaurant.

This is fantastic.  I used Oreo crumbs instead of graham crackers, omitted the cocoa, and increased the butter to 1/2 cup.  Also sprinkled a few Heath Bar bits on top after baking.  Everyone loved it and thought it was professional quality!!

VERY rich!  Not good at all without the chocolate chips, so be sure not to try it without! (I tried a tiny one with the extras that didn't fit in the pan)

I am not a cheesecake fan, but my husband and family LOVE this one and I do too. I have used all sorts of different cookie crumbs to make the crust too and they all come out perfect. Wonderful recipe!

This is a very good and very easy cheesecake.  I have made it according to the recipe, and also have tweaked it a bit for these past holidays.  I added a bit of mint extract to the crust (about a capful) and also to the cake (3 capfuls).  Also, instead of choc. chips, I used Andes Baking Chips (find them next to the regular choc. chips at the store).  It made for a very different and refreshing cheesecake for Christmas.

Super Good!  I have only made a few cheesecakes before, but for some reason this one seemed easier than those in the past--not to mention better.  Liked it so much that I dared to make one and take it to work, and it got rave reviews.  A KEEPER!

Excellent. This recipe was a hit with my husband and his family for his birthday. Not too heavy like some cheesecakes. Very creamy and smooth. Love the crust. A definite keeper. Thank you!

This isn't as hard as it looks. This is my first cheesecake and it turned out really good. It is smooth, filling and tasty. I couldn't wait to taste it -- I didn't let it set in the fridge, so the chips got a bit melted when I cut into it, so wait! Don't be impatient, it is well worth the wait. I didn't use a springform pan -- I used a regular deep dish round pan, about 9 inches, instead of removing, I just served right from the pan. The 1 hour cooking time is a little long -- Watch your cheesecake closely during the last half hour, mine seemed to be done in about 45 min. I left it in the oven and didn't remove as per suggested. After that, I transferred it to the fridge to set and let cool. I also used regular sized morsels since I couldn't find any minis at my supermarket, still great. Easy to make, and very delish. I am definitely making this again!

This is one of the best chocolate chip cheese cakes I've ver come across.  I've made this over and over again for different occassions.  I add a few more chocolate chips.  I put about a full cup in the cake mixture and about a 1/2 to 2/3 cup on the top (What can I say, my family loves chocolate).  Also, in my oven it needed to bake a little longer than the 1 hour in the directions (about 1 hr 15 min.)

While I have never made a cheesecake before, and so probably should not rate this off of the first try,  I don't think this was the best cheesecake I have ever had, but it was pretty darn good.  I did bake it in a water bath and had no cracking.  The appearance was beautiful, and the texture was really creamy, but my husband, whom I made it for, said it was good, but to try another recipe next time. It was very easy to make though and I may use the original recipe again trying other mix-ins.

This cheesecake is great, but not my favorite.  However, my husband and I did manage to eat the whole thing by ourselves over a couple of days!  It's not very rich, so you just want to keep eating piece after piece.  I will probably make it again.

This was my first time making a cheesecake and I was very happy about the way it turned out.  When I first tasted it, I thought it was so rich I could only have a few bites...but then I started craving it and ate a lot more than I care to admit.  Served it at thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Will definately be making this again!

Very good! Made this for Chritmas! Great with chocolate sauce and whip cream on top. Mine did crack even though I cooked it in a water bath. Seemed like the cooking time overcooked sightly. But very cgood flavor and good presentation!

I've had several baked cheesecakes, but this was the best by far.  I actually had my sister down on her knees begging me to make her one!!

The great crust really made this easy to make cheesecake.  It was much better than crusts that call for chocolate graham crackers.  Of course, I had to add extra mini chocolate chips.  Delish!!

This was delicious!  It was very easy to make and turned out great even when I got stuck on the phone and it cooked an extra 10 minutes.  Next time I plan to try melting some extra chocolate chips to make it marble.

Though I only had one bite, it was incredible!  Made it for some of my guy-friends and they RAVED about how good it was.  Definitely a keeper.
Other than using a whole bag of mini choc. chips instead of 1 c., I made it exactly according to the recipe and it turned out perfect.  Didn't crack either.

My first time making a cheesecake, and this one turned out perfectly! Thanks for posting this recipe. Cheesecake mixes will stay on the store shelves from now on, since making my own from scratch is so easy, and it's so much better.

VERY VERY GOOD!  Not hard to make either.  Very rich!
I got on a "cheesecake making" kick for awhile and made several different recipes.  This was by far the BEST!  I don't know if it was the condensed milk or what, but I loved the consistency.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was my first cheesecake, The husband and kids loved it ! It did sink in the middle, maybe I cooked it to long ? My personal preference would have been for it to be more creamy and more chocolate chips. ;) Thanks for the recipe !

I've never made a cheesecake from scratch before and I wanted to make one.  This recipe was extremely easy to follow, the directions were writen very well, and the best part about it was that it tasted excellent.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I made this recipe in November, after cooling in the refrigerator overnight, I cut it into serving sizes, wrapped it in Saran and froze it until the Holidays.  It was the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted and was the big hit of the family gathering.  Next year I'll make several ahead to take to all the gatherings or give as gifts.

This cheesecake was pretty good - but really had a hard time removing it from the springform pan.
Would probably make again but have other cheesecake recipes that are better.

I am so glad to have found this recipe again.  I lost it years ago.  Absolutely the best cheesecake ever.
