This was easy and delicious! Mixed homemade taco seasoning with butter instead of Cajun seasoning, added salt, pepper and lime juice to salsa. Will definitely make this again! Thank you for the delicious recipe:-)

Color me impressed! This was bursting with fresh flavor, fast to make, and tasty as can be! No guacamole, but it would only serve to enhance the taste even more. I wanted a little bit more of a salad so shaped my tortilla by draping it on a muffin tin, which I turned upside down. Quite a tasty lunch!

I was a little skeptical at first because of the salmon. However, this was a perfect meal!

This turned out excellent! We used fresh salmon that was on sale and made at ton of food for under $20. We think that flour tortillas tasted better than the corn tortillas.

I typed in “canned salmon” and this recipe came up and I’m glad it did. Although I did use canned salmon, I still mixed the butter, lemon juice and Cajun spice together and added to the canned salmon and served cold. I used canned tomatoes, rinsed the black beans (a must) and also added green bell pepper - What an appealing and tasty salsa! Served with homemade guacamole and juiced and grated lime added to plain Greek yogurt. A summer must make - no heat needed this way.  Thank you for this recipe!

My husband, son and I loved this - thank you - we had salmon burger meat from Alaska that we used - just like hamburger - and still used the lemon and butter...YUM!!! Thank you. We will have it again
