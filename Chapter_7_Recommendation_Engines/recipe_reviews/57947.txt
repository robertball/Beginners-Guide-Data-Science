I am mexican and these are not at authentic at all, however they are nice.

But salsa is never optional, is the main ingredient.

Just wanted to put this bit of info out there for everyone, anything with Cheddar cheese is not authentically Mexican.  If you want to reduce the fat in this dish you can just put a little bit of butter in a pan, then slightly toast the tortillas in the pan.  It comes out just as good with less fat.  Just a suggestion.

I don't know whether this is authentic or not; all I do know is that this breakfast was really good! I added green onion, a little enchilada sauce and some shredded pepper jack cheese. Great Giamom!

Good, but not great.  To make it much more authentic, fry the bacon and then use the bacon grease for the beans.  Personally I prefer to cook/boil dry pinto beans then mash them up while frying them in bacon grease, just like they do in Mexico.  If you don't want to prepare your own beans, then use canned pinto beans instead.  Anytime I make beans for friends, they all rave about the taste.  Try it and see if it doesn't improve the flavor.  
I also prefer a green salsa verde (tomatillo sauce) and jalisco queso instead of the red salsa and cheddar cheese.

I make this at home often.  It's very good.  Different flavor salsas are fun to experiment with too.  (and I also use fat free re-fried beans... they taste great)

As others have said, these are not authentic by any means, but who cares, since my husband loved them!  He even made more the next morning with the leftover ingredients and surprised me with breakfast in bed!  I added diced tomato, lime juice and cilantro to the refried beans and heated it on the stove.  Also, you can just use cooking spray to "fry" the tortillas, and it's just as good, but less fattening.  Very delicious.  EDIT: These have become a regular at our house, and my husband goes out of his way to make them!

I see nothing authenic about this recipe.  Scratch the beans, scratch the bacon - only use corn tortillas, eggs and fresh homemade salsa rojo(made from dried NM red chilis, water, salt and garlic).  Maybe a little queso blanco on top...

These were good for Americanized Huevos Rancheros, but nothing like authentic.  One thing they need is a good ranchera sauce (not salsa), but the recipe I tried from here was not very good so I'll keep looking.

8/20 I made this for Husband's brunch and wanted it to be a bit more substantial, so I doubled the eggs and bacon, sprinkled with lots of extra-sharp Cheddar and Mexican cheeses, topped with jarred sliced jalapenos, and served it with salsa and black beans. This was quick and easy, and very filling. Thanks, giamom!
8/25 Made these again today but spread the refried beans over flour tortillas, added scrambled egg, bacon and salsa, and rolled them up. Really good!

Good, filling, and comforting in the way only breakfast-type food can be.
I took other reviewers' advice and heated everything under the broiler to
re-warm and melt the cheese.   Listen to the amount of refried beans
and cheese.  I once eyeballed what looked like the right amount on each
tortilla to me and it was a bit too much beans and not enough cheese.     
But when I followed the quantifies listed in the recipe, everything
balanced well.  I was indifferent about adding the salsa or not.
Incidentally, I skipped adding butter to the beans, and skipped the bacon.

IMHO this is a very quick and satisfying meal. I could not eat this every week due to the caloric content. But as we all know, moderation is key. This is a nice comfort food recipe. Give it a try.

Like other people have said, Authentic? not even close. dont mean to be mean, but the only authentic thing about that recipe was the tortillas and eggs.it sure looks good, but it has too much going on.

No clue if these are authentic or not but they are good and that is what matters in my book. I fried the tortillas until crisp due to personal preference. This was a nice change.

Yum!  Easy, easy, & fast.  Microwaved beans while cooking the tortillas.  Added some diced jalapenos over the beans before putting the egg on.  We've had them for supper too!

Sorry. This is defenitely not authentic huevos rancheros. In fact,it really doesn't qualify to be called "huevos rancheros" at all - there isn't even a ranchero sauce included in this recipe which is the "ranchero" (salsa isn't ranchero) The recipe is okay for whatever you want to call it but please..change the name to something else. It's very misleading, and culturally insensative ro call it by the name of a classic mexican dish which it is not. Thanks.

- An authentic Texan

I'd never made this before...never even eaten it before, actually. Though my husband is a fan.

This was very tasty and quick to make. I didn't use canned refried beans, I mashed a can of pintos and added green chili's, cumin, garlic and onion powder. MUCH better, in out opinion.

This was yummo and we'll definitely be making it again!

These are not Authentic. I omitted, the butter, and bacon. I spread the refried beand to the tortillas, added a layer of homemade salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, jalapenos, cilantro, lime juice, salt, knorrs chicken boullion), and added a layer of mexican cheese, eggs, and some avocado slices and crema.

Fabulous! I actually used my bacon pan to cook everything: I first fried the bacon and then fried the tortilla in the grease. I had made some homemade refried beans, so I mashed those in a little grease next. Then I cooked the egg in the same pan after that. I also added green chiles and a half chipotle pepper in adobo, diced on the top with the bacon. I was very happy with the result!

This is my first attempt and it turned out pretty well.  I used flour tortillas, put them on an oven rack under the broiler (a couple slots down).  Broil until brown on one side, then flip.  Watch closely so they don't burn.  They turn out really crisp and no oil.  You can do 4 at a time this way.

I don't care what you call it  -  it tasts good! Up to an including today, many felt it was more important to critique the name rather than the food! This seems to be an unhelpful trend. So many critisize the ingredient list not the taste, but the bad for you ingredients! I'm sorry, but I'm sure that All Recipes members already know that a b'fast of deep fried bacon, french toast made with real eggs (vs: egg whites) and cream and white bread is not good for you. This knowledge also includes un-natural foods, low fiber, high carb, anything that tastes good! Thx, Tish

I do a chopped potato hash brown (not shredded) instead of the beans, top with the eggs and cheese, and pour the heated salsa over it and sop up with corn torillas..........love it.
ps can omit the bacon and it is still good.

My boyfriend had been craving these for days and I had actually never made them. I didn't have time to make the salsa, so I altered the recipe a little. 

I fried the tortillas, laid them on a plate to dry, while I fried the eggs sunny side up. I put the eggs on top, opened up a can of herdez mexican salsa, topped them with cheese and then put the beans on the side. He said they were pretty authentic, at least for him.

Good! Simple and delicious. I made it vegetarian by leaving the bacon out, and it was still really yummy.

I have eaten Huevos Rancheros in several parts of Mexico, Arizona, Texas and even in the Midwest.  I don't know what "Authentic" means because cooks do things differently.  I am going to try this because it sounds good.

this was very good. I just mixed my bottled hot peppers with plain refried beans. I didn't add butter to the beans and I cooked the eggs over med. It was good.

These were delicious. The only change I made was no bacon since I'm a vegetarian, instead I put sliced avacodo on top and it was perfect.

Terrific brunch dish.  I had never put beans on the tortillas - this is a nice addition.  I make a batch and put them on a cookie sheet, topped with some green chilie salsa and lots of cheese and run them under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Very good - nice change from just bacon and eggs.  I fried the tortillas and the eggs in the bacon grease.  First time I made them the food wasn't hot.  So the next time after I assembled them (putting the cheese on the top which it doesn't tell you in the recipe) I microwaved each one for 30 seconds or until the beans bubble and the cheese melts.  Then top with salsa if desired.

This is a great version of a classic Mexican breakfast. It turned out great and I did a couple changes. I used chorizo instead of bacon and substituted pepper jack in place of cheddar. May not be authentic but turned out great for this gringo!

Who cares if the recipe is authentic or not it is delicious. I want to hear people's opinions on the taste of the food, not whether or not a recipe is authentic. It defeats the purpose of the reviews and it's not very helpful in helping me decide if I want to make it or not. this recipe will go into my regular breakfast menu. My husband really liked it.

I'm not Mexican and am certain it's not authentic, heh heh.  With that said, it wasn't bad :) and I agree that salsa is not an "option".  I added cilantro, feta and a drop of lime juice.

These are ABSOLUTELY delicious!  My Guatemalan husband and I will make these a regular weekend breakfast!  We only had regular refried beans, no Chile kind, so to add a little extra kick we added Tapatio on top.  We honestly wished we had doubled this recipe, because when it was all gone, it was so good that we wanted more.  Thanks for adding this Wineaux!

Could be the green salsa, which I normally prefer, or the fact that I had to share one tortilla between 3 servings.  i didn't love it, but would try again and follow recipe more closely/traditionally.

I used flour tortillas, made with the refried beans without the refry on All Recipes. Loved the egg on the refried beans, great for brunch, kept it a bit healthier and didn't add bacon. Topped with some cilantro, and salsa. I wasn't hungry the rest of the day.

This was very good. However, I did make some changes to make it a bit healthier. I used a low carb tortilla, I used cooking sorry instead of oil, and I used homemade fat free retried beans with no butter. Yummy!

These are great when you need a quick meal.  I bought a package of crispy tostado shells so I didn't have to worry about frying the tortillas.  I also used some real bacon bits instead of frying up some bacon.  Overall not bad and would allow for changes to suit your tastes.

Loved this recipie, but I don't like the idea of frying the tortillas, so I just used whole wheat wraps, and wrapped them up. I know they aren't authentic that way, but my family loved them.

My mother in law made this for me when I first met my husband. Her and I both do a few things different. First we don't use beans, second we scramble our eggs, and last we use tomato saue with a little bit of water and add onions, jalapeno to that. We then place the scrambled eggs( that is done like an omlet, not scrambled scrambled.)on top of two corn tortillas. Of course we put the melted Munster cheese on top with beacon.

I made this for breakfast one morning, seemed to be alright.  although I'm not a great cook by any means, I was able to make it, I think it took a little longer to prep than I had anticipated.  still a pretty good meal

Who cares if it is called authentic or not. It was delicious. I warmed tortillas instead of frying. Also layered 2 tortillas with beans because we are big tortilla fans. Put it all together and nuked it for 30 seconds to warm and melt cheese.

I don't know how "authentic" these are, but they were a hit with my family.  I had all the ingredients and they were pretty simple to make.  I didn't have refried beans w/green chiles, so I just added them into the beans before warming them.  For my 6-yr old, I made him seperate beans w/out the chiles.  My tortillas were VERY chewy...I don't know if I fried them too long, or not long enough, or if they were old.  I also added SW seasoning and green onions on the top.  I broiled them after they were assembled to melt the cheese, which I put on the top. (it doesn't say what to do with the cheese).  Next time, I think I'll try them with flour tortillas, per my son's request, and maybe just use spray oil and/or butter like other reviewers have suggested.  Jalapenos would be good too!  These were pretty good.  I will make them again...something different for dinner!  :))  Thank you!

Did you know that fat free refried beans exist? I didn't until I made this recipe. Surprisingly, it still tasted really good! I'll be making this for breakfast again next weekend.

This was my first time making huevos rancheros and not only was it easy, it was really good!  The only time I've had it better was in Mexico.  I used Canadian bacon instead of regular bacon and put it over the beans, and I used everyone's suggestion and broiled it to heat it up and melt the cheese.  I also added a little sour cream on top.  I'll definately be making this again!

This was a great recipe, and a great vegetarian recipe if you leave out the bacon. I simmered the beans on the stovetop with some chopped jalapenos, green salsa and spices while I cooked the tortillas, maybe that could help the people who have said theirs gets cold too fast. Mas juevos! Tu vaca es grande!

I was a little leary of making these since the ones I've had in the past have many times been boring but I had some tostada shells I wanted to use up.  But these were pretty good.  They weren't dry like some are.  I've never had them with bacon and that was a really good change.  Like Bogey I too microwaved them once assembled because everything does get cold.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.    It does take a bit of time to prepare (making the bacon, etc.) but it is delicious.  We used it for dinner instead of breakfast/brunch.

Definitely not authentic, ... bacon!?
Now, I grew up with the tortillas softer yet fried, beans cheesy yes, but off to the side and a green chili sauce topping fried eggs, generally on taste how many. Potatoes fried with onions,  as a side depending on budget and taste. 
Guacamole optional   ; ).
This recipe looks dry and not traditional not authentic with the BACON!

Nice recipe.  My hubby LOVED this, and I thought it was pretty good as well.  I made a ranchero sauce from scratch instead of using salsa and we only had flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas so I just warmed them up, not fried them.  I also used morningstar veggie bacon.  MUCH lower in fat than the original recipe, but still bursting with flavor.  We actually ended up eating these again for dinner a few nights later because it was so easy to make.  I had some cooked, chopped shrimp from dinner the previous night and I threw that on top as well the second time. Yummy.

These were simple to make and tasted quite good!  We did not bother with the bacon, although I'm sure they would have been even better with it!  Also just sprayed the pan with Pam rather than using oil.  We assembled them and then put them in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.

this was delicious, i made a few alterations. I used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon. I fried the corn tortillas in butter and i added the cooked salsa under the corn tortilla as well as on top of the eggs. I also used mozarella cheese instead because that's all i had on had and i topped it with sour cream.

Instead of frying a tortilla, I just used a tostada shell.  Also, I skipped adding butter to the refried beans and omitted the bacon to keep it a little healthier.  We really enjoyed these!

these rancheros are great.  i have made them several times trying differant things each time.  the best that we have found is to fry the tostados till well crisp or buy the crisy ones from the store.  always top it off with green salsa and you got yourself a very very yummy dish.  thanks for sharing!!!!

This recipe was fantastic! I used the recipe for Vegetarian Refried Beans, but instead of using pinto beans and making them myself, I used a can of refried beans to save time. I used red peppers instead of green and over all throughly enjoyed this recipe. Thanks!

This was reallllllyyyyy good!  I only used Pam spray...I didn't use vegetable oil or butter b/c you don't need it.  I also made black beans and mashed them and added a few tbs of salsa and cumin to it (b/c I didn't have refried beans).  I layered them as tortilla, beans, monterey jack cheese (instead of cheddar), strips of bacon (instead of crumbled), the egg, green onion and a small spoonful of salsa.  I didn't really mean to make these changes but its just what I had on hand!   Soooo good!!!

Very good! Didn't use any bacon or salsa since I was out of both (had just bought salsa, I swear my husband must drink the stuff!), but it was still delicious. Will definitely make these again and again.

This is my first time having this and it was so good. I didn't have bacon so I left it out, next time I will try it with the bacon. Instead of salsa I added sour cream. I can't wait to make agian. Thanks for posting.

I don't know what all the hoopla is about whether this is 'authentic' or not.  It's just plain good! Cheese snobs might say use cotillo, queso blanco or whatever. I say whatever you have is fine.  I do suggest trying the Hatch brand Huevos Rancheros Sauce, and the vegetarian or fat free refried beans are excellent. Thanks for reminding me about a simple and delicious meal!

This was very good. I made a minor adjustment in that I did not use traditional refried beans but ground up hot Ranch Style Baked Beans (very hot and not traditional ranch style beans) and used in place of the refried beans. I also added more cheese to the top. These are a big hit at my house.

YUM YUM YUM I love this recipe! My kids chowed it down, too, and asked for seconds. Also, try and fry your tortillas in the bacon grease instead!! MMMMMMMM!

This was very quick and easy. This literally takes less than 5 mins. to make! We used regular flour tortillas and turkey bacon for our personal prefernce.  I was suprised at how well the egg and beans flavors tasted together. Also, 1 is very filling!

I followed the recipe exactly as suggested and it was oily and it needed a little bit more, maybe some spice or something like that. To me this was too bland.

We liked this recipe, it was something a bit different.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and after assembling, I put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  My husband wasn't crazy about the fried egg and requested that I use scrambled egg next time.  I made this for dinner but will make it again for weekend breakfasts.
