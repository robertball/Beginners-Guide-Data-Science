It seems to be a blur in distinguishing a muffin/quick bread from a cake/cupcake and I suppose you could call this one either. To me, what it now boils down to is this: if it's plain, it's a bread or muffin, if you frost it, it's cake. So I made this CAKE into cupcakes, baking them at 350 degrees for about 22 minutes.  I frosted them with "Maple Icing," also from this site.  And they were perfect - pretty, moist, delicious and spiced very similarly to a pumpkin pie.  Nice recipe.

I've made this cake four times and it has been a big hit each time!  Slight revisions:  I use butter, add 1 tsp of vanilla, cut down the sugar to about 1 c white and 3/4 c brown. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of all the other spices when I ran out of ginger. I've made it twice with a cream cheese filling (blending together 8 oz cream cheese, 1 egg, and 1/4 sugar)-- Put about half of the batter into the bundt pan, pour in the cream cheese filling evenly on top of that, top with remaining cake batter, bake for an hour. Cool and dust generously with powdered sugar. Delicious.

Very moist and flavorful cake.  I did sub 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 of the shortening.  I also used a cup of whole wheat flour, which I normally do in recipes. I was surprised that someone said this cake was bland.  Perhaps their spices are outdated.  With the pumpkin and spices, it's hardly lacking in flavor.  I didn't frost the cake, but I did add a glaze on top.  It doesn't really need much since it is a very tasty cake as is.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving.  It was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  I made the cream cheese  frosting to go along with it.  
I do, however, have a complaint.  It would be helpful for others if the frosting recipe was included as well.

This is an EXCELLENT cake. We baked it (in a bundt pan) for Hallowe'en. Decorated it with orange coloured cream cheese icing.Then crafted a stem and leaves from craft paper.  It looked just like a real pumpkin. It was delicious and a hit with everyone.

Wonderful recipe! I divided it into a 3-layer cake, frosted it with a cream cheese frosting, and sprinkled some mashed up cinnamon graham crackers on top. It was an absolute smash! 

I did only bake it for about 25 minutes, though. Not sure where the 60-65 minutes comes from. Would have burned it if I'd cooked it that long.

Some have complained about this cake being dry - better to substitute half butter for the shortening which also gives a richer flavor.   Great keeping cake.

These were VERY good. Everyone loved them. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin, but I think these were prefect. Reminded me a lot of bananna bread.   Instead of using a bundt pan, I cut the recipie in half and made 12 miniture ones. Perfect for snacking.

This is a simple cake and if you get the pumkin with the spices already in it, it is easier yet since you don't have to add much.

Turned out beautifully. Instead of shortening I used three mashed overripe bananas. Note that the initial mix will NOT get fluffy, just mix until well combined. Makes a nice thick spicy cake, great with a bold coffee.

This is awesome! Made it a few times, here's my changes: because I didn't have enough shortening I used 3/4 cup butter, softened, 1/4 cup shortening, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and 1/4 cup applesauce. I added about two teaspoons vanilla, and increased all of the spices by using heaping spoonful's, same for the pecans, a heaping half cup. I followed the original recipe for everything else except baking soda was reduced to 3/4 tsp. because I live at 7000'. Baked as a bundt cake, it turned out perfect: moist, tender and tasty, and keeps well.  My daughter made a buttercream glaze to drizzle on top: 2Tbsp butter, softened, beat into 2 cups powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. Whisk in about 1/4 cup milk, or half and half, glaze should be liquid enough to flow, but thick enough to hold onto cake as it drips down sides. Add milk or powdered sugar as needed until consistency is just right. Pour on the top of bundt cake, thicker at places, let it run. Leave some of the sides uncovered. The glaze will have the essence of a snow capped mountain with avalanche trails. My daughter added milk and powdered sugar, trying to get the right consistency and ended up with  twice as much glaze as needed. No problem, covered the leftover glaze, put it in the fridge for a few days then made another one of these.

I needed a solid pumpkin cake for seasonal mousse cakes at the restaurant I work in. Before even trying the recipe I immediately changed the fat to canola oil to make the most moist cake possible (plus I've never had a good crumb with shortening) and used cake flour instead of AP. My substitution was 190 g (~2 tbls short of a full cup) of oil and I omitted the nuts. I baked it in a half sheet for about 20 minutes in a convection oven at 350° F and pulled out the most amazing cake. The finished product just went on the menu!

Yum! The only mistake I made is that I only had an 8 1/2 inch bundt pan instead of the recommended 10 inch and the pan was a bit small. But I made the cake for my son's birthday party, more for the parents, and everyone loved it! I also made it with fresh pumpkin puree rather than canned and it had great pumpkin taste.

Made this last night and, although it was easy to put together, the results were not at all what I expected. The cake was moist but I thought it tasted bland and lacked spice.

For altitude I decrease baking powder by half and add 2 T of flour.  I also do not add pecans as I know those with nut allergies.  Very moist and flavor cake with a moist dense crumb.  For icing I do 1 package cream cheese, with maple syrup and evaporated milk adding syrup to sweetness desired and milk to consistency desired.

I made this into cupcakes without the nuts and added mini chocolate chips. I used cinnamon cream cheese frosting. I lowered the temp to 345' and baked for about 22min. they definitely have a lot of spice to them and I loved the chocolate chip addition. They were dense and moist and very very good!

Yummy dense, flavorful cake bursting with goodness. I made the cake as directed except I was out of ginger and didn't have allspice so I used a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg. I also used raisins instead of nuts and made a cinnamon buttercream frosting instead of cream cheese frosting. The only problem is as that I'm eating it for breakfast as I sit writing this review.

I replaced the shortening with 1 cup of oil, replaced the sugar with 1 cup of sautéed and pureed dates plus 1/2 cup maple syrup, reduced the flour to 2 cups (1c whole wheat, 1 cup white) and added raisins.  It turned out very moist and delicious; definitely healthier than the original version

Good cake, fabulous texture. Very strong spice flavour that totally overwhelmed the pumpkin, but still tasty. Didn't have allspice so substituted ground cloves. The batter seemed not very moist when all mixed, and as I'd read other reviews saying the cake was too dry, added 1/4 cup applesauce to bump up the liquid content. Also didn't have a bundt/tube pan so put in 8x11-ish pan, and sprinkled some nuts on top.
Will likely make again but with less spices.

I exchanged the shortening for real butter, I used organic fine pastry flour and changed the white sugar for raw honey, plus added 1/2 cup organic applesauce.  Whenever I find a recipe I usually swap out the processed ingredients for real food, tastes much better and better for you.

I tried this as is the first time, and it's good, not great. A little on the dry side for me, and the level of spice wasn't where it needed to be. So on my second go-around I added an extra 1/4 cup of pumpkin, an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and a whole teaspoon of ginger and allspice instead of 1/2. The batter is thick, almost like muffin batter instead of cake, so I added maybe 1/8 cup of almond milk and a dash of vanilla extract. It came out much better the second time, more moist, more flavor. Pair it with a maple buttercream and it's absolutely to die for. Will make again.

Great recipe, I find it's somewhat sweet though so I did a salted caramel drizzle and made it a full cake instead of a bundt cake. Way tasty.

I didn't put a glaze on it and I think that would have made it even better, but it was still delicious!

I needed a way to use up the canned pumpkin and leftover cream cheese that I had, so I decided to try this. OMG it is amazing! I couldn't even wait until it had cooled off before eating some.

I did run out of shortening though, so what I ended up doing was using 1 cup of vegetable shortening and 1/4 cup butter. I also added roughly 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of vanilla extract. Just a little splash. I also had to omit the nuts, since I am allergic. My cake was done after 50 minutes in the oven.

For the icing, I used the same recipe that I use for my cinnamon rolls. 8 oz Philadelphia cream cheese, 3 tbsp milk, 2 tbsp unsalted butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 cup confectioner's sugar. Mix and pour it on while the cake is still warm (not immediately out of the oven, but warm enough to let the icing lightly melt over the top), top with a mixture of equal parts cinnamon and granulated sugar. This cake is bomb, and I'm not sure how much longer it will last in the kitchen! Definitely a keeper.

Using the advice of other reviewers, I substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce and just 1/2 cup shortening. I also made the Maple Icing (by Rachael on this site) recommended by Naples34102. The combination of the rich spices and light pumpkin flavor in these cupcakes with the creamy maple cream cheese frosting is a delightful treat!

I wanted a bunds cake that was moist and not too dense. I added 1 tsp. Baking powder to make sure it would have “lift”. Also the batter seemed very thick, so I added 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk to make it a little more like cake batter. The cake turned out great. Maybe I would not have had to make these modifications. I am saving these in my notes and will make this cake in the future. It was very easy and GO

Amazing! Perfect spice, perfect texture.  I used margarine instead of shortening, but I doubt that affected the flavour so I think my review is still relevant. I topped it with cream cheese icing. So good I could eat it all day long.

So very good and moist....everybody who had a piece raved that it was excellent.  Very cold day so it was a perfect for warm spice cake with pecan cream cheese frosting.

The flavor is very nice but it was way overbaked at 55 minutes and that is why some people report it being dry. I used the exact size of Bundt cake pan recommended. The batter came together well and tasted great but I knew it was overdone at 55 minutes when I took it out. I'd start checking at 40 minutes if I made this one again, which I honestly probably won't because there are better ones using oil that aren't as finicky about baking time, and I prefer oil cakes to shortening/butter ones generally. Thanks for sharing!

Wish I read the other review first. It was moist, not dry as other reviewers noted but it was more like a pumpkin bread. So pretty coming out of the bundt pan! I added a warm cream cheese glaze and ground extra pecans with a little fresh nutmeg and sprinkled over top. I thought about adding vanilla but didn't, I saw another reviewer did. Next time I would do the cream cheese filling (as another reviewer did) or just make as a bread in 2 pans and frost. Very good, very delicious! (ps I subbed in butter for the shortening, and I would also pretty much double up on the spices, as another reviewer suggested)

Instead of baking two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving, I made this cake as a pie alternative. It was very moist and delicious-we put whipped cream or ice cream on top. I'll be making this again, soon!

This recipe was loved by all my boys.  I added a cream cheese frosting.  It was very moist and flavorful. The spices were not overpowering and the pumpkin gave it a wonderful taste.
