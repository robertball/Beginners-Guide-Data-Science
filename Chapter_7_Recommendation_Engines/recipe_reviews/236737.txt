This went together so easily.  I did make a few changes I used lime juice instead of lemon and I used fat free Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  While most of the ingredients are healthy this is not a light dessert, it is rich and a little bit is satisfying.  This will be making an appearance at many BBQs this summer. Thank you Doryce41!
