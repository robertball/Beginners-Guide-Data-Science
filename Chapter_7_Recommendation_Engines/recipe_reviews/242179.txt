This is a very refreshing smoothy and an excellent Summer drink.  I did substitute the mango for fresh peachs.

1.8.17   My fruit was very sweet and perfectly ripe, and I didn't think I needed so much added sugar, so I cut the amount back by more than half.  I loved the contrast of the tart lemon, and I didn't want to lose that with too much sugar (just my personal taste preference).  This doesn't separate, so I think also it would be something that you could make in advance and put in the fridge.  Good refresher and loaded with lovely fruity flavor.
