This was just okay.  I thought that the chicken pieces turned out WAY too tough - perhaps cooking them in the skillet and adding them to the sauce at the last minute with the tomatoes and green onions would solve that problem.

This recipe was excellent - after a few modifications. I do believe the chicken turned out to be tough and a little flavourless. After that I decided to use prawns instead. It was great, they absorbed the sauce's flavour! I just used cooked frozen prawns. I also added extra tomotos, green onions, italian seasoning for extra flavour and thickened the sauce near the end My changes:
-Rinse frozen cooked prawns in cold water to thaw slightly
-Saute with garlic for about 1 - 2 minutes
-Add sauce ingredients as instructed 
- Add 1 tsp. or more italian seasoning (however much you like)
-Near the end of the cook time add small amounts of flour to thicken the sauce to desired consistency (otherwise I found it to be a little too watery)
-complete directions as instructed

I made this for guests and they loved it.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I used all chicken broth, sauted onion, mushrooms and garlic first (before browning the chicken), and added a small can of chopped tomatoes w/ green chili (instead of the fresh tomato - mostly because I didn't have one).  I also omitted the cheese.  It was great without it. Everyone enjoyed the end result.

This is delicious! I've made it twice now, and the second time I made a few changes. I added a small can of sliced black olives, and instead of the peas I used green peppers.

This was turned out to be pretty good.  I used mushrooms instead of peas,substituted onion powder for the onion, used a can of diced tomato seasoned w/ basil and oregano and used some leftover marinated chicken from the night before.  I sauted the mushrooms, garlic and tomatoe and added the chicken in w/ wine and broth.  I also thickened the sauce a bit w/ cornstarch and water and added more italian seasoning.  Very tasty, good base recipe.

I had to give this only 4 stars because I changed the recipe a lot, based on reviewers suggestions. Too many reviewers commented on the chicken being overdone, so my solution was to grill the chicken (I undercooked it slightly) then I chopped it up and added it into the mix at the end with the tomatoes and peas. I also slightly undercooked my pasta (whole wheat) and added that into the sauce before I added in the tomatoes, onions and chicken. This helped the pasta to really take on the flavors of the sauce, and helped to thicken the sauce. Everyone had seconds!

Wow. Amazing! I made this without the chicken, because I am a "pocketbook vegetarian" these days and meat is a rare treat. Excellent as written--no thickening needed. Did you let it cook down for 15 minutes as recommended? This concentrates the favors--thickening it would have made it too dry as well as blander.   The second time I made this, I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted sweet white vermouth. It's cheap, but difficult to find in the States and not very popular, so I don't know how many of you have any, but if you do, try it! The spices in the vermouth subtly enhanced the flavor of this dish to whole new levels. Wowza!

This was great!  A nice change from heavy, cream sauces.  Used 1lb. of linguine and added about a 1/2c of mozzarella to the mix.  Sauce was just right and everything stuck to the noodles no problem.

Love this!  It's quick and easy...I'll probably try broccoli instead of the peas, next time, as I'm not a huge fan of peas, but it was really nice!

This dish tasted wonderful and was very easy to make! I didn't have any peas, so I substituted frozen broccoli florets which worked nicely with the other ingredients. Next time, I'll steam fresh broccoli and add it toward the end, to retain its crispness. This would also taste great with asparagus or zucchini. I will definitely make this again!!!! It will be great for company and looks pretty tossed in a big, colorful pasta bowl.

The sauce was okay: alittle bland for my taste but just right for my husband.  The sauce was very thin so I used cornstarch and water to thicken it.  I don't think I'll be making it again.

Excellent. I had to leave out the green onions and substitute penne for fettucini but still very good. I pre-cooked the chicken and started at "add chicken broth".

This recipe is a nice new flavor from the cream sauces.  I loved the fresh tomatoes.  I didn't have the right type of noodles, so I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles and they worked fine.  I did add some thickening like was recommended by other reviewers and that was a must.

This recipe was pretty good.  I use only whole wheat pasta and was out of fettuccini, and I used shells instead.  I was worried about this because I thought the sauce would be too thin to hang onto the shells.  But I was wrong, the sauce actually filled each shell like little cups.  It was good and seemed very light and fresh, sort of like a vegetable soup with pasta in it.  The sauce was really thin.  Next time I will add more cayenne.

Although the flavor was pretty good, the brothy sauce didn't stay on the pasta, just pooled on the plate, and the veggies didn't stay on the pasta because of the thin sauce.  This made it seem like having plain pasta.

this was quick and easy and very tastey.  I did add 1 more clove of garlic, some dried thyme and basil.  I ran out of chicken broth so did have to use a little beef broth to equal one cup.  Very low fat.  It was done in a jiffy.  I didn't have trouble with the toughness of the meat as other reviewers did, but I used the chicken breasts that come in 3# packages and there is water added so they were very tender.  Just added salt and pepper to taste.  Served over fettucine and didn't measure how much...just eyeballed.  Very nice, light, and quick but very tastey.  Served w/some baguette and a salad.

Just OK, but we used too much fettucini really (1 lb instead of 3/4 lb) which would have spread the sauce thinner.  Should have pulled the extra cooked 1/4 out for the kids earlier.   Family kept dumping the cheese on since it came out kind of bland.
