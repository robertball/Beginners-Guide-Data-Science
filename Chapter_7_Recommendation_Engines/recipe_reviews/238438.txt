I’m not sure if it was because I used butter instead of margarine, or because I added extra chips and nuts that the cookies did not spread, however they were still very good and wonderful for the chocoholic.

So .. I hadn’t made these is a couple years.  Today, I made a double batch.  I got 5 1/2 really large cookies out of that double batch. 

While cooking,  I played with the temperature a bit.   At exactly 350 degrees, the cookies came out with a beautiful glossy cracked pattern and a brownie-like texture inside.    When I dropped the temperature to 325 degrees, the cookies lost that.  They looked “softer” and just not as pretty of a presentation.

It was an excellent reminder to me that when baking cookies, correct  temperature is really important.

These cookies turned out amazing. I actually used a full 12oz bag of Hershey’s Special Dark chips as well as a 12 oz bag of Sea Salt & Caramel baking chips. What an awesome flavor. It did take them about 13 minutes to bake vs the 8-10 as directed. Will definitely make these again!
