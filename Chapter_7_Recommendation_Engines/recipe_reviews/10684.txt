People definitely love these cookies!  I do a few adjustments to the recipe to make it less sweet and divide out the goodness a little more...  I cut the amount of brown sugar to 1 cup and the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I use half quick oats and half old fashioned oats.  And so I can get chocolate in tinier bits all over the cookies, I use mini baking M and Ms and the mini chocolate chips.  I tried it with chunky PB but found the smooth PB tasted a tad bit better.  

I was fooled the first time and waited until they looked done before I took them out.  That meant they weren't as chewy so make sure to take them out right before they look done!

These were excellent!!!!  I made them just as the recipe stated.  One tip (I found this out from making cookies in the past) you must use the ice cream scoop or make them that big to have them turn out.  If you try to make them small, they will turn out very different.  The second time I made these, I ran out of creamy peanut butter so I used part crunchy.  I think I liked this mix - it added to the texture.  Yum!!

These are my family's favorite treat, but I only rated it 4 stars because of all the revisions I have made to the recipe over time. Changes include: 1) substitue 3/4 c. of oats for flour. 2) Use half quick cooked oats and half regular rolled oats, so they're not so grainy/dry and stick together better. 3) I cut both brown sugar and white sugar by about 1/4 c. each (they're still almost too sweet) And 4) Substitue part of the chocolate chips and M&Ms with Butterscotch chips, so you put in an equal amount of each.  Definitely make these large or they will be very hard and flat. ENJOY!

This is an excellent recipe but noticed that many stated they were hard. This is a special trick for ANY cookie which seems too hard.
Place cookies in an airtight container. ADD a slice of bread or 2 and cover. Wait to see what happens over night. I would try just one slice first.
The bread provides moisture to the cookie and makes them moist. I have had cookies so moist they fell apart so just try the one slice first.

This recipe is very good! I made it like some other reviewers did and substituted 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips for 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips...very yummy. Even though the recipe is wonderful "as is" I tried cutting back the sugar on my 2nd batch and liked them even better! (1 cup brown sugar and only 1/2 cup white sugar)

This is the recipe I have been waiting for!  I had a Monster cookie recipe that worked well for me over the years.  For some reason the cookies haven't been staying together recently.  Maybe they are making margarine with more water now or one of the ingredients have changed causing the recipe to not work.  I've been searching for another recipe similiar to the one I had.  This is it!  I followed the recipe perfectly and they are beautiful cookies!  They are NOT flat!  They are perfect size.  I bake 6 cookies at a time to give them enough room to evenly bake.  What a hit!  Thank you so much!

This is the best version of monster cookie recipes I have tried!  It makes a good size batch and they freeze really well, I often put a few in small freezer bags and put them in my husbands lunchbox.  He loves them!

They stay chewy so to us this recipe is 5*! used 1/2 butterscotch chips, 1/2 choco chips. I used 1/2 cup less brown sugar than it called for and it was still very sweet to me.I may take 1/4 cup white sugar away next time and see how it does. Kids went nuts over these goodies.

The alterations I made made this a 5 star, but I can't speak for the original recipe so I gave it a 3.  I left the amount of sugar alone, and was glad I did.  I also added 1 tsp of salt, doubled the butter, and replaced 1/2 of the oats with flour and used quick cooking oats for the rest.  Using an ice cream scoop like the recipe said, I made 1/3 of the recipe and only ended up with 12 GIANT cookies.  These were a little fragile, even after setting for a few minutes to cool, but they turned out with a beautiful texture when they were completely cooled.  My husband very much enjoyed these, next time I will make them smaller and just reduce the baking time.

Let me tell you..these cookies are excellent! I made them for my school and everyone has requested the recipe.  However, switched it up alittle bit.  I added pecans, white chocolate chips and chocolate chips instead of the M&M.  This is a GREAT recipe!

This recipe is GREAT!  We have gone to an Amish bakery for years to get these yummy treats, now I can bake them myself.  Think these will go great in the bake sale for the Girl Scouts we are having...if the cookies last that long!  Hubby has sold all that I have baked so far, with more on "order", from him and his co-workers!  They have seemed to freeze well, great when making several items in advance! thanks vicki

After a bit of trial and error these turned out great and were a big hit in my family. A couple of things that I figured out were: 1) the cookies form better if the dough is rolled or scooped with a small ice cream scoop, as the recipe suggests. Since I don't have a smaller ice cream scoop I did rolled the dough into balls. The dough got really sticky and hard to handle due to the pb, so next time I will refrigerate it between batches. Rolling the dough made the cookies rounder and fuller. When I tried just scooping the dough onto the pans with a spoon the cookies got flat and rough shaped.   2) The cookies need to come off the pan within a minute or so of coming out of the oven and placed on a cooling rack. If left on the pan they will stick to the pan and will break apart when you try to scrape them off the pan.

Oh My Goodness these are the best cookies ever! I can't believe anyone would give this recipe less than 5*. I was skeptical about no flour, especially after reading some of the reviews, but honestly no changes are necessary unless you prefer one type of candy/chocolate or nuts/no nuts; the recipe bakes perfect, chewy cookies. Due to my preference I cut out 1/4 of each sugar and added pecans. I baked mine for 13 minutes and just spooned a larger amount of dough for each cookie instead of using the ice cream scoop. They turned out perfect...they looked like and tasted like a cookie you would buy at a specialty bakery. Honestly, my family's favorite!

This is the first recipe I've tried for monster cookies and they turned out fantastic!  I would not change a thing!  I did not have an ice cream scoop so I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup.  They were irresistible!  I ended up giving the entire batch away to family members so I wouldn't have them in the house tempting me to eat them all!

I make these cookies using this recipe SEVERAL times every year.  It's a perfect cookies, quick and easy to make, especially if you have a stand mixer, as the batter gets super thick when you do the oats.  A stand mixer powers through it.  The trick to keeping them soft and chewy is to TRUST THE TIMER!  Pull them out, they may not look done, but they are!  If you bake them too long, they will be hard and crunchy!

Where's the flour?  These barely held together, and were extremely flat, dry, and hard.

I had to add quite a bit of flour to these to get them to stick together after they were baked, but that could quite possibly be because I am at a high altitude.  Once I got them to stick they were wonderful!

What a wonderful recipe! I made these for my 2-year-old son's birthday party, and heard comments about them all afternoon. I took a member's advice and reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup (instead of 1.5 cups) and that turned out to be the perfect balance. I stuck to all the other instructions, though I was a little worried because the butter consistency wasn't specified. I was pretty sure it should be "softened" (as opposed to melted or cold-chopped), and that turned out to be right. There was just enough peanut butter to taste, without overwhelming the other flavors. They turned out wonderfully chewy, too! Before the party was over, I had guests begging me for the recipe.

Monster cookies are one of my all-time favorite cookies, and this recipe is excellent!  I didn't make any changes to the ingredients, but I do have some tips.  The M&Ms were very slippery in the dough, so I left most of them out and pressed them on top of the cookie before baking.  I used a 1/4 cup measure for each cookie which resulted in about 24 cookies.  I rolled each cookie into a ball, then pressed the M&Ms onto the top, and then baked on an insulated cookie sheet for about 13 minutes (6 cookies per sheet).  To prevent the cookies from spreading too much, I chilled the dough in the fridge for a bit before baking.  I also let the cookies cool on the sheet for about 5 minutes before removing to a cooling rack.  This recipe resulted in some fabulous, chewy monster cookies!  Loved 'em!

These were really good.  Froze extras and made the mistake of trying to eat one frozen when I got the munchies.  It was even better than the fresh cookies so I ate 3!  LOL

Excellent, these are my family's favorite cookies but they are in limited supply to purchase locally- thank you for sharing; now I can make them anytime we get the craving! I did follow the "less sugar" variation and they're perfect.

I've never made nor eaten a monster cookie before,  I was pleased!
I followed a few suggestions and reduced the brown sugar by 1/2 cup also reduced the oats (quick cooking) by 1/4 cup. I used mini semi sweet chocolate chips and mini m&ms, and a #16 portion scooper to drop the dough.  Baked for 12 minutes, I would have liked them to be a bit more soft,so next time I  will bake for 9-10 instead. The recipe yield says 72 cookies, I got 36 nice shape and consistently sized cookies. I think any smaller and they would be too hard.

Before I made this recipe, I read many of the reviews and decided not to change anything except add butterscotch chips to the mix. (I just made the M&M's , chocolate chips and butterscotch chips to equal 2 cups total).  I used a large muffin scoop and baked 6 cookies on a pan as suggested by others and baked the cookies for 12 minutes.  They turned out GREAT!  They were crisp on the edges and soft in the center.  I did find that you need to let the cookies cook for several minutes prior to removing them from the cookie sheet or they will fall apart.  I did not find that they were too sweet and my kids loved them.  They also sold like hotcakes at the bake sale.
This recipe is perfect as is!

This recipe was fantastic. The cookies were moist and chewy and tasted great. The only thing I did different was instead of something like M&M's and semi sweet chocolate I used milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. I also used light karo syrup.

Ok, I just made these and they are AWESOME!!. I followed the recipe except used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter because that's all I had and I added some chopped pecans too. This is fabulous. They are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside....PERFECT!!

These cookies are delicious, but beware if planning to make for a large group.  The original recipe states that it will yield 6-7 DOZEN cookies.  There is absolutely no way that you will get anywhere near this many cookies if you use an ice cream scoop to form the cookies.  I had planned on making this recipe to have several dozen for a get together tomorrow.  However, I am going to be lucky to squeeze 2 dozen cookies from this batter.  Very misleading.  Unfortunately did not buy more ingredients to make another batch.  :(

mind were super flat. They tasted good, but looked bad... I think they needed more oats or a few T. of flour?

Very good cookies.  I docked a star because they are too sweet as written. Leave out a whole cup of sugar and they're perfect!

These taste okay, but they're a bit unwieldly to bake and transfer so I'm a little on the fence on these.  I thought I might not get these in my Christmas cookie tins since they are so large but thought I'd try anyway.  However, these are so not going to work, and not just because they are large.  They are very delicate (despite the name!) and do not transfer from cookie sheet to cooling rack to plate easily at all.  Half of them were crumbling apart.  And, they don't stack well.  They are a pretty hearty cookie if you can get past that, but they aren't pretty because they are so fragile!  I subbed peanut M&Ms and was worried they wouldn't work, but they worked just fine.  I'm glad I tried these, but unless bf adores these cookies, I don't think I'll make them again just because they are frustrating to bake.  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed instructions exactly. The cookies tasted good, but they came out very flat. I wouldn't make this recipe again. Not something I would want to serve to guests.

These were soo good. I made a few adjustments. In exchange for the butter i added peanut butter and in the place of the peanut butter, i added some chocolate fudge i had made earlier that didn't set. The first batch of cookies came out flat but very tasty, crunchy on the outside and chewy. Then i decided to throw the rest of the dough into a brownie pan and made blondie things, and boy were those even better! Maybe someday i'll try the real recipe.

I could not get these cookies to stay together. I tried a smaller scoop, pressing them tight, cooking for 12, 13, 14 and 15 minutes but no matter what they crumbled on the cooling rack. My husband requests these all the time and I failed epically on this one.

Used 2 c of quick oats, the remaining old fashioned oats. Used a little over 1 c of brown sugar, somewhere between 3/4 c and 1 c of white sugar.  Put 6 m&ms on each cookie, loved the results!  Stirred by hand in a big bowl, used real butter.  Baked 12 min, no longer or definitely would have been too brown I think. Any less and the center would not have been done enough.  Impressive looking cookie and very yummy!  Did use an ice cream scoop so they were nice and big, only put 6 on a sheet at a time.

YUM!  I did replace 3/4 cup of the oats with flour, but I'm not sure if it made much difference.  And yes, it IS possible to have too much chocolate in these cookies, so stick with the amounts listed!  Next time I think I could definitely cut down the amount of sugar and they would be just as delicious, as they were very sweet (and I love a sweet cookie!)
Update: I have made these several times now and add 1/2 tsp of salt, and cut the brown sugar back to 1 cup.  Delicious!

I've tried several monster cookie recipes since my first monster cookie at my sister in laws house a number of Christmas's ago. This one is the best. Chewey in the middle and crispy around the edges. Its going in my recipe box as a keeper!

I made the cookies exactly as written and they turned out perfect.  Just the right amount of puffiness and soft on the inside.  My family has decided that this is now their all time favorite cookie.  Guess I will be making it a lot more!

I added 1 1/2 cups of flour because it seemed really sticky to me and I cut the sugar down to 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white.  The cookies turned out good but they didn't seem sweet enough..so next time I'm use the original recipe and see what happens.

Have made other Monster Cookie recipes but so far this one I like the best. I followed suggestions of others by using a large scoop and patting dough down a bit before baking. Using an icecream scoop I got 18 big fat yummy cookies, moist and yummy. Next time I might try adding butterscotch chips and or coconut. On my second try I reduced sugar to 1 cup brown and 2/3 cup white and still wonderful cookies! I also added butterscotch chips, about 1/4cup and it was extra yummy.

Not sure how these would've turned out if I had followed the recipe exactly, so I give the recipe 3 stars.  Unfortunately, I followed the reviews and took away about 1/4 cup of both sugars and replace 1 1/2 cups of the oats with flour. I believe it was the missing sugar that was NOT a good idea. These cookies were BLAND. They also seemed like they weren't done at 12 min, but when I let them go to 15 min they were TOO done. ugh.

mmm mm mm. By far the best cookie I have ever made. Everyone that has tried one wanted seconds and sometime thirds. Like other viewers suggested, they may not look finshed baking when you take them out of the oven, though they will finsh cooking will cooling.

I was looking for a scaled down version of the original huge recipe. I tried cutting it down once and the cookies were not good. THIS is a very good version of the large one. I will use it alot. Thanks Mary

This recipe really needs flour.  I am an experienced baker and had to add 1c. flour to the recipe.  I use a 1/4 scoop to make these and they went extremely flat and started to overcook on the edges before the middle was cooked.  I will try these one more time with 1.5 c flour and a little salt.

This recipe is a ridiculous hit!  I get requests for these cookies constantly!  The only change I make is I use white chocolate chips instead of chocolate so they aren't "overpowering" with chocolate!  You won't be sorry you made this one.... other than the demands for more! more! more!

I've made these twice now. The first time, I didn't have butter or white sugar. I used cream cheese instead of butter and powder sugar in place of white sugar. I was scared that they wouldn't turn out, but they actually worked better than the ones I made a few days later following the recipe to the t. The problem with the ones with the butter is that they spread out really really largely and burnt and fell apart quickly. I give this recipe 5 stars because it can be easily adjusted and still work!

Well, the first several times I made these I only used a half cup of white sugar and they were delicious. I just made them again with the full cup of white sugar and was dissapointed. They were sweeter, so the peanut butter and chocolate flavors did not stand out as much, and I really like to taste those flavors and let the candies add the extra sweetness. I use bittersweet chocolate.

Monster Cookies IV Haiku: "Crumbled, flat, and dry. Glad I halved the recipe. Should've been great /cry." So many scattered reviews, w/ so many alterations, but I stuck to my guns and followed the recipe, but cut it in half, which gave me 25 cookies - 25 cookies that were a flat, crumbly mess (and one cookie sheet thrown out.) Oh and I used all M&M's rather than chocolate chips & M&M's. Such fabulous ingredients, but maybe I should've taken so many of the random suggestions and changes that others made, but frankly, I don't think I'll go to the effort again. But despite the mess that they made, my daughter and some neighbor kids ate them anyways.

HUGE hit!!! Will definitely make again. Only thing I did differently was add more chocolate chips and m&m's.  Recipes was great and very easy to follow

I cut the sugar to 1 cup brown and 1/4 cup white, and they are still VERY sweet.  Influenced by other reviews, I replaced 1/2 cup oats with same amount of flour.  Only issue for me is that they did not spread much at all, and using a small ice cream scoop gave me only 40 cookies.  They are chewy and delicious; but I am still searching for a recipe that is just a tad better.

Ok, I have made these twice. First time as is but with butterscotch chips instead of MMs (I am not a fan of MMs baked in cookies). Great cookies and that is what I gave my 5 stars on.  My second time I only had 1 cup of rolled oats so i used quick oats for the rest -- cookies did not turn out as chewy. I also used some cinnamon chips as I only had a few butterscotch left. I like the butterscotch and chocolate better (first batch).  I also used a large cookie scoop instead of an ice cream scoop the second time and dropped my time down to 11 minutes. Honestly, the smaller scoop could account for them not being as chewy, but I think it is the quick oats. I strongly suggest either using the ice cream scoop or lowering the time for smaller scoop.  So, recipe is a winner as is, even little mods will alter this recipe!

I didn't even notice when I started making these that there wasn't any flour.  After putting all of the ingredients in, I went back and read the recipe again to make sure that I wasn't missing anything.  Nope, no flour in these.  And thank goodness for my KitchenAid mixer because I could not imagine trying to mix in all of those oats by hand.  I followed the recipe except I used Reeses Pieces on the tops for my peanut butter loving kids.  Using the ice cream scoop, these are Monster cookies.  I made about 12 this size and then used a smaller scoop for the rest.  This recipe does yield a large amount of cookies.  Good thing - they're going fast.

Hrm.  I remember having a family friend bake these (or a version, anyway) for me during my childhood.  And while the taste is similar, the appearance is not.  Like other reviewers, mine flattened out way too much, leading to fragile cookies.  I would highly recommend chilling dough for at least 30 minutes; I'd hate to see how big my cookies would've gotten if I hadn't chilled them first.  Not saying this recipe is horrible, I just didn't end up with great results.  Better luck to the next baker!

Very good, but I would prefer a little less peanut butter. I thought it overpowered the chocolate a little.

This recipe is great!!!  Used all quick oats because thats what I had on had, let the vanilla run over the tsp. suggested  tsp. to fit my tastes, and halved the sugar to accomadate my blood sugar.  Everyone loved these.  Next time I will add a pinch of sea salt, and sub raisins and dark chocolate for the semi-sweet chocolate and m&m's.  Pecans or walnuts would also be delicious in these.  Monstrously good!!!!

Everyone loved these, including me!  I did cut down on the sugar as recommended by other reviewers. Technique I used when I baking was wait until the the middle of the cookie isn't "shiney" but still puffed up, take out and let it sit on baking sheet for atl least 5 minutes.

Good cookies. Can't believe they don't have flour, but it worked fine. My huge cookies didn't quite bake all the way through before getting too brown, but I like them gooey in the middle.

These are great! I used half the sugar (I think they'd be way too sweet with all the sugar), and I replaced one cup of oats with one cup of AP flour. I also used Peanut Butter M&Ms and used a lot of them! (we like our peanut butter!) They stayed soft for 3 whole days, and I couldn't tell you how they fared after that because they are gone!

I just made these cookies and they were so good!  I only gave 4 stars because I took the advice of the other reviews and did 1c. brown sugar and 3/4c sugar. I only had quick oats so that is what I used.  They were perfect with those little changes!

This is exactly what I was looking for! I didn't change any ingredients, but I used a large Pampered Chef scoop (the one for muffin batter) and baked 6 at a time on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Baked for 11 minutes and then let rest on the cookie sheet for 3 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Texture and taste was great and I'll be interested to see if that changes any the next day - assuming any are left :)

The taste was mostly peanut butter but the cookie wouldn't hold together.  The next day, when you tried to pick one up, they just crumbled.  Too costly and not that good, to try again.

I made this cookie recipe twice. The first time with regular oats and people thought them a bit too high fiber. The second time I used quick oats and the texture was more appealing. The main problem with both batches is that they got hard on the day after baking, even when sealed up air tight and set out at room temp. So if you don't plan to eat/give away all of these on the day of baking, I would look for another recipe. Happy Baking!

I made them as the recipe stated, but used 1 min. oats. I was kinda worried about there being no flour, but they turned out GREAT! I used a Pampered Chef ice cream scoop, baked them 11 to 12 min. Let them cool and set up for about 5 min on the cookie sheet. I will definitely be making these again!!! Great flavor and crunchy/chewy texture. A keeper recipe!

Easy and healthier than mom's.
Used 1 c. Brown sugar, 3/4 c. Splenda, mini baking chocolate chips and mini choc. Chips - regular size might not keep the cookies together, 1/2 quick oats and 1/2 rolled oats.
Took 14 minutes convection multi 
Only made 2.5 dozen maybe
Make 1 batch at a time or else too hard to stir.
softened butter

Made them and the brown really nicely at 14 minutes, but this did not make 6-7 dozen. I used a large cookie scoop, not as big as an ice cream scoop, but larger than your average cookie and it didn't make quite 4 dozen. They are still good and turned out really well, but the serving needs to be adjusted to 3-4 dozen

I love this recipe. I didn't have chocolate chips so I used chopped up vanilla candy coating and loved it. Neighbor's kids even ate the few burned ones.

Made these today for the first time and they were wonderful. I used a whole bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips along with 1 cup of mini M&M's. Otherwise followed the recipe to exact. Baked for 11 minutes on parchment paper....turned out great!

This a great monster cookie recipe. My only comment is for a soft cookie take the first batch out at 12 minutes even if they look undercooked. See how you like them after they settle and adjust the time if needed. Mine were a bit crunchy for my liking even after 13 minutes.

These are simple too make and taste awesome! Don't know how you got 72 cookies out of this batch. First batch I made REALLY BIG ones and got 14 out of it, the second batch I downsized a bit and got 44!!
I have since modified the recipe as follows:
4 cups oats instead of 4.5
2 cups crunchy peanut butter instead of 1.5
milk chocolate morsels instead of semi-sweet
Now its perfect!! Not so hard and brittle.

No flour? I've made many cookie recipes but nothing like this that didn't have flour in it. The cookies flattened out and almost burnt on the edges. They tasted closer to peanut brittle. Will not be using this one again.

I love monster cookies and since I couldn't find my recipe I used this one, and that was a mistake! I followed the recipe but these came out terrible, not together and sticking to the ungreased cookie sheet! Won't be using this recipe again

When my husband announced these were the best cookies he'd ever had, this became my new go-to! I followed another suggestion and used 2 cups quick cook oats, 2 cups old fashioned oats, and 1/2 cup flour. I had minis M n M's so I used a little over a cup of those, a cup of mini chocolate chips and another 1/2 cup of regular chocolate chips. Using an ice cream scoop worked perfectly - and they didn't spread out much at all. Super yummy though!

Turned out great! Obviously if you don't use the ice cream scoop and bake for 15 minutes, you're going to have crunchy cookies, if not burnt. If you use a smaller utensil you bake them less. Heaping teaspoons full baked for 9 minutes, then my secret for soft cookies is smacking the bottom of the cookie sheet on the counter a couple times right when they come out of the oven. Thanks!

I had to substitute baking powder for baking soda the first time because I didn't have any.  I used baking soda the 2nd time... tasted much better with baking powder.  These cookies are to die for!!!

delicious! I made the cookies as written +1/2 of raisins. I would recommend for the m&ms NOT to use any peanut or almond ones. They kind of explode and the oils from the nuts make them disconnect from the rest of the cookie. Although, peanut butter m&ms do not do this. I recommend sticking with peanut butter or plain m&ms. 

I have made these cookies with coconut oil instead of butter and it works great. 

My secret to Monster Cookies VI is to:
1. refrigerate the dough for at least an hour
2. make dough balls very big, like bigger than a golf ball
3. when cookies are done baking, smash them down with the spatula RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN

#3 is the most important step to a dense and chewy cookie, something someone with a gluten-allergy craves!! 

next time I will try making without eggs and do a ground flaxseed and h20 substitute.

Awesome!!! These were very easy to make & all the ingredients were things I always have on hand (except the candy coated pieces so I just doubled up on the chocolate chips). My family loved these so thank you for sharing.  Next time I think I'll add raisins.

Turned out perfect!  I did not have corn syrup, so I used honey.  I also cut the recipe in half (I had to crack the egg, mix it, and take out 2 Tbs. of liquid. Half the recipe gave me 18 large cookies.  Yummmmmm.

This recipe is great as is. It is easy to put together. It stays chewy and has a great peanut butter taste without tasting like burnt peanut butter that so many do. My personal preference is to add more chocolate chips (about 12 ounces) and replace the M&Ms with Reeses peanut butter chips.

These cookies are so delicious. I add walnuts to mine just because my family likes them that way. However, these don't make as many cookies as the recipe says it does. I use a regular sized ice cream scoop and it yields 30 cookies.

These cookies did not last long in my house!  They were very good!  The texture was perfect.  I followed one reviewers advice and used an ice cream scoop.  The only thing I did differently was to top the formed cookies with the M&Ms rather than add them to the batter.

These cookies are awesome and makes a lot too!  Made these for a bonfire this past weekend and of all the desserts I had, there were very few of these left.   After I measured the peanut butter out of a new jar, there wasn't much left, so I ended up scraping the rest (small jar) into the bowl.  I used chunky too.   They're best if you don't over-bake them but just as good if you do!

Flavor is EXCELLENT!  I would definitely suggest chilling the dough--my cooking got VERY flat and VERY hard to get off the cookie sheet!

these were my favorite cookies when i was a kid. i was so stoked to find the recipe! i made it as is and like other reviewers, found it a bit sweet(and i love sweet stuff). the second time i made them, i reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and the brown sugar to 1 cup. they were OUTSTANDING with less sugar! i will definitely be making them again! yum!

***WOW!!***These are soft, chewy, like a recess peanut butter cup collided with a best chewy oatmeal cookie! I followed the recipe exactly -- my three kids and husband devoured them.  I added Easter colored M&Ms and they are beautiful! EVERYONE asked if I would make them again, and often!

These were sooooo yummy. Omitted the corn syrup and used half quick oats and half rolled oats as suggested by reviewers. These didn't seem to spread that well, so I pressed the dough ball a bit before baking and pressed the cookie a bit after baking. I also let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or two before moving to cooling rack as they were very soft. My husband thought he didn't like monster cookies, but he ate so many. Our new favorite!

These cookies are my favorite.  I've been eating them since I was a little girl.  I have the same exact recipe, however, mine doesn't call for any corn syrup.  It's not even needed in this recipe and omitting it make the cookies even healthier!  All other ingredients are the same though.  No one can believe these cookies don't have flour in them!

These were really good and just what I was craving.  I used half flour and half oats because I was worried about having too heavy of a cookie.  I also used mini chocolate chips because that's what I had.  I had nice round, not flat cookies.

Just like the recipe I remember my Mom making!   I have made them with the full amount of sugar and a little less - tasted great both ways.   To help with the spreading that a monster cookies tends to do as baked, I ground 1 cup of the oatmeal into flour using the blender and use that as part of the 4 1/2 cups in the recipe.  Also, if you form your dough into balls and the stick them in the fridge until chilled, your cookies won't spread when they are baking. For those of you who ended up with a crisp cookie, be sure to use butter not margarine!  In general when baking margarine results in a crispier cookie.

They spread a lot and you should let them cool on the cookie sheet before removing so as not to break these chewy cookies. Different and yummy. Reduced the brown sugar to 1c. and the white sugar to 3/4c. as per another reviewer. Also used mini chips instead of the regular size. Will make again. Thanks!

I have tried one other monster cookie recipe.  Neither one is what I'm looking for.  Didn't care for the texture of this cookie at all.  I halved the recipe, used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, 2/3 c. br.sugar, 1/3 c.wh. sugar. and replaced 1/2 cup oats with flour. Have used "Big Fat Chewy Choc. Chip Cookies" several times and love it.  Looking for a monster cookie with similar texture. This cookie was really thick and crumbly.  I want it to flatten out a little and be crispy aroung the edges and gooey in the middle. Maybe I'll play around with the choc. chip recipe.  Won't make this cookie again

This was a great recipe.  My only change was to add about 1.5 cups of flaked coconut (an impulse) and used the small pampered chef scoop.  I like little cookies.  Baked up perfect.  Still moist and wonderful on day 2.

This is the best Monster Cookie recipe I have ever used!  The cookies were perfect.  A hint of peanut butter, a delicious blend of oats and sugar, perfect.  I used chocolate chunks instead of candy covered chocolates... melt in your mouth.  Thanks for this excellent recipe.

Ok I made a big mistake when I made these cookies.  The dough seems way too sticky when you put it on the pan.  DO NOT ADD MORE FLOUR!!!  I added more flour it is a bad idea.  They come out really good and are chewy if you don't add that flour.

used butterscotch chips in place of choc chips, since you have m&m's. Sometimes I use chunky p'nut butter or add raisins....depends on our moods! I do use 1/4 C sugar and 1/2 C. splenda in place of a whole cup sugar and then add 1/4 C. more brwn sgr. NEver any left!

I made these with our foreign exchange student who is a self proclaimed bad cook and they turned out great! They didn't fall flat at all and were delicious! We scaled the recipe to make 48- which it didn't make that many. We were making them for my dad's birthday present. I used crunchy peanut butter because that's his preference. I'm sure that he'll love them!!

I have one simple word for these:  DELICIOUS!  However, my batch was only 2 and 1/2 dozen instead of 6 to 7 dozen.  I'm not sure why because I followed the recipe exactly.  Nevertheless, DELICIOUS!

This is a great recipe! I didn't have the problem of hard cookies...of course you can't overbake them. I baked mine for 9 1/2 minutes, let them cool on the pan, and they were perfect (they looked almost underdone when they came out...just slightly brown on the edges. I wouldn't add the flour like some did. This dough is a perfect Monster cookie dough. The only modification I made was to substitute the 1c of m&ms with 1c of raisins, and then I decorated the tops with m&ms. That's the way we did it at a bakery I used to work at. Yummy!

ahhhh! I understand why someone recommended using the ice cream scoop. Worked wonderfully. I was a bit skeptical about this recipe, especially after realizing it didn't contain any flour, but wanted to try it. I followed the recipe except for the following: skipped the corn syrup and used only 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips. Everything was room temperature when I started mixing. Baked at 350 for 15 min. Husband ate THREE right off the bat so I guess he liked them. Thanks Vicki!

The best!  I made them last night and they turned out AWESOME!  I didn't have corn syrup though so I didn't add that.
Thanks so much for a great cookie recipe!

I have to say I was a bit skeptical about the recipe at first wondering if flour was a mistaken missed ingredient but I went ahead and made as the recipe stated only I didn't have butter and used butter flavor shortening and didn't have corn syrup and used pancake syrup instead.  I patiently waited to see how they were going to turn out and had flour on standby but didn't need any.  I am pleased with the results.  The cookies looked great coming out of the oven and held shape and taste wonderful.  Will definately make this recipe again not changing the ingredients I used.

These are amazing!  I skipped the corn syrup because I didn't have any, but otherwise baked exactly as the recipe states.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Super easy, absolutely great crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside cookie. I followed exactly like the recipe except didn't use the corn syrup, didn't have any. Turned out great! Not sure what the benefit of using the corn syrup would be. I highly recommend this as a tasty, semi-nutritious snack for your kids. My kids loved them! Thanks!

Recipe was a gooey mess and the chips fell out of the dough; something whacky about the texture.  When I put the dough in the oven, it just "melted" into a wet pile and they never cookied properly.  I've made monster cookies before with different recipes, but this one was a little odd.  Why is the butter added after you have the eggs and sugar mixed?

Yummy good cookies with one flaw...WAY TOO peanut butter flavored!!  These were a big hit with my family!!!  If I made these again, I might add a bit more choc chips and M & M's.

They turn out a little bit flatter than most, but they are scrumptuous!  Very moist and very delicious!!! As an option, I add a few milk chocolate and peanut butter chips about a 1/2 cup each.

These cookies were great! I followed the recipe except for putting in less sugar like others have suggested (1 cup brown, 1/2 cup white). I also added about 3/4 cup peanuts. Making them big is the way to go, I made one batch slightly smaller and the big "monster" ones were the best. I highly recommend this recipe, it will probably be one of my new favorites!

I have made these! so good.  I decreased brown sugar 1/2 cup and omitted white by 1/4. I did not use chocolate chips. An ice cream scoop was a bit big. I had to cool 2 minutes on baking sheet or they would fall apart.  very chewy. Very good cookies. I got about 36 with this recipe.

These taste like a bad imitation of a Monster Cookie.  I guess if you have to go gluten free they would be an option.  The Karo syrup gave it a funny taste.  They did not spread well.  I've made Monster Cookies before with the Pioneer Woman recipe and they turned out great.  Definitely going back to that recipe.

Awesome cookie.  I followed other reviewers and subtracted 1/4 c each of white and brown sugar.  12 minutes at 350 worked well for me.  I did flatten them out slightly to get a flatter cookie.  
One important note this recipe makes 3 dozen cookies using an ice cream scoop.  You can use a regular cookie scoop but then they won't be MONSTER size.

After reading the other reviews, I added a little flour and used half quick cooking and half non quick oats.  They taste great!  But they did flatten quite bit after taking them out of the oven and cooling.  And they are very chewy even though a couple of the bottoms are a little too dark (take them out before they look done!)  They also did not hold together well when transfering to a cooling rack.

I followed this recipe to a “T” and they turned out PERFECT. I misplaced my usual go-to monster cookie recipe and was stressing out trying to find a replacement. Need cookies for a teacher appreciation luncheon tomorrow and these were a god send. Even my picky husband approves. Two thumbs up!

Best cookies ever! I read many of the reviews how people altered the ingredients or said they were hard, but I followed the directions, except used no chocolate chips and substituted more M&Ms for them, and they turned out awesome. I baked mine for 14 minutes each batch. 2 days later they are still soft and still taste wonderful.

Added 1/4 tsp salt. Did'nt have ice-cream scoop so fridgerated dough roughly  one hour then rolled dough into bigger than normal balls and baked for 8-11 minutes depending on ball size. Very good recipe!   Also  added wanuts and 3/4 c raisins.

I made these using Wow butter (soy nut butter) since I have a peanut allergy in my house.  I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer reducing the brown sugar by 1/2c and the white sugar by 1/4c.  These tasted ok but I think if I make them again I will use the full amount.  Wow butter must not be as sweet as regular creamy PB.  I also used a big scoop and put the dough in the fridge between batches which may be unnecessary when using wow butter.  When scooping the cookies onto the cookie sheet, I did press them down a bit as they didn't spread as much as in the oven as I anticipated.  I rated my version 3 stars; more sugar might improve it.

My all time favorite cookie!  I add when available, chopped large walnuts, or peanut butter chip or Resses  pieces.  The walnuts gives some oomph to the oats and the peanut butter bits add another layer.

I didn't have  M n Ms so just used choc chips. also used maple syrup instead of light corn syrup. First batch was made with the ice cream scoop. They were good but the rest I made with a little cookie scoop. About tsp size. Only cooked the little ones 10 min. They turned out perfect and very tasty. We liked them better than the big ones.

These are almost too good.  I ate 3 of them right away.   The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp of salt.  They are great as is.  Maybe too great.  I made them for tomorrow.   Hopefully they make it until then....

Update.  I have tried making them different ways.  I personally prefer them with quick oats.  Tonight I tried making them, but was short on oatmeal.  I substituted 1/2 cup of flour instead.  It was not the same.  Not bad, but more like a regular cookie.  Not the same texture at all.  I have tried and prefer them with replacing  1/3 of the chocolate with butterscotch chips.  Also it is easier to top the cookies with M&M's rather than mixing them in.  They will also look better.  I do make them with 1/4 cup less brown sugar so it's not such an intense sugar high.

I make as-is and they are perfect.  Scoop big balls of dough and bake for 12-13 min for soft, chewy cookies.  I even use some peanut MnMs, and some salted caramel chips in there, which add to the tastiness.

Extraordinary cookies! Definitely a hit in this house tonight. I did make a few changes. I substituted 1 cup of the oats for all purpose flour and I also added a 1/4 cup of ground flax seed. I used a medium cookie scoop and cooked them for 12 minutes. They came out gooey and firmed up to perfection. After cooling, they were the perfect bite.

This was a great recipe.  My husband and kids loved these cookies.  The only changes I made was to use mini milk chocolate chips and mini M&Ms.  I forgot to add the last 1/2 cup of oatmeal so only 4 cups was used.  I did use an ice cream scoop and baked at 13 minutes.  I also made some smaller size cookies by using 1/2 ice cream scoop and baking at 8 minutes.  Both turned out perfect. I will be making these cookies again.

This is an awesome recipe ~ huge hit w/ my family. The only changes I made were: 1 1/4 cup brown sugar, I doubled the M&M's (used red and green ones for holidays) and omitted the chocolate chips. Also omitted the raisins & subbed pecans. Will make again varying up the add-ins. so versatile.

We used a similar recipe in our bakery for 20 years. Always a popular cookie and healthier than most! I did cut the white sugar to 2/3 cup and the brown sugar to 1 cup. I added eye balls from Wilton since I made them on Halloween. Chilling the dough before baking helps keep from spreading. Baked 12 minutes then added another 2 min.  Not. every oven is the same, so under bake and check. Just a golden brown edge is perfect, and they will stay moist.  Remember cookies keep baking after your take them out of the oven for a few minutes.

I just made these cookies but added 1 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped peanuts .I cut the brown sugar to 1 cup and they are still very sweet I also don't use  corn syrup.. they fall apart when spooning them on the baking  Next time I make them I will use 1 cup of butter I think that will make them taste little better

Love this recipe!  The only change I made was to replace the 1 cup of m & m's with 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped pecans, simply because of personal taste.  Will definitely make this recipe again!

Cut sugar, per reviewers recommendation to 1 c. Brown and 1/2 c. White. Also mistakenly picked up quick cooking oats and used only 4 c. hich turned out well as we use all natural peanut butter which can be runnier than standard Jif or Skippy brands. The quick cooking oats allowed the grain to soak up more of the natural oils and liquid, I think. I also added 1/2 c. Oat flour bc I didn't want cookies falling apart but I wouldn't necessarily do that step again. They turned out fantastic and will be treats for my sons birthday class tomorrow.

Yum! I added 1/2 tsp salt, reduced brown sugar to 1 cup, reduced white sugar to 3/4 cup, and used all M&Ms. The recipe says it makes 72 servings. I did not get that many cookies, but I appreciate the smaller batch compared to other Monster Cookie recipes out there.

I love this recipe. The only issue I had was that it is dry and hard to ball together without having candies left in the bottom of the bowl. I DOUBLE the butter (1/2 lb not 1/2 cup) and it adds needed moisture and makes them a softer chewy texture. I also prefer putting in butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips.

I will definitely make these again. Crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside!  I made a couple changes that I'll keep: added 1/2 tsp salt, reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup, reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I reduced the chips and candy-coated milk chocolate pieces to 1/2 cup each so I could add a 1/2 cup raisens and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  The flavors were kind of lost. Next time I'll probably leave out the candies and add the full cup of chocolate chips as the recipe says.  I used parchment paper and baked them for 15 min exactly.  It yielded about 70 cookies. I'd highly recommend them!

I have tried to include a pic of my cookies but am having some technical difficulty. I am so disappointed because my cookies are in big mounds. They did not spread out at all. They taste good but look BAD. I followed the directions and my husband even checked the directions. We could find no mistakes. I did use a stand mixer. What happened?

We really liked these!  I didn't quite have enough peanut butter, so I cut that down a tad and also ran out of M&Ms, so I subbed in some Reese's pieces.  I cut down both the chocolate chips and candy pieces to about 3/4 of a cup.  I love the chewy texture to these.  I will definitely make again, but will likely cut the recipe in half because this made over 50 good size cookies, which is a lot for our small household.

Updated: I've made these several times and still love this recipe as is. The first time I made them, I agreed with some reviews that they are a tad "grainy" as others put it, due to the amount of oats. I liked them that way, but wondered if they'd be better for others if I tried using part flour (1 c.) instead as someone else recommended. I regret trying it. They weren't even nearly as good. I  always stick to the amount of oats called for now.  I also disagree with those who say they're too sweet. It's a monster cookie and supposed to be pretty sweet and I feel like the peanut butter is the prominent taste in these. The only substitution I would suggest making is using whatever chips/candy combination you like best, still totaling 2 cups combined. I also think the mini baking M&Ms worked better than regular ones. I like them best with 1 cup of those and 1/2 cup each mini semisweet chocolate chips and regular white chocolate chips. I'd also recommend starting you're timer at 10 minutes or less. Mine are perfect at 11 minutes using a cookie scoop (1 tbsp size) slightly heaping to form them. I also gently press them together once they're on the pan to keep loose chocolate pieces in place.

Not sure why people are having problems with these. Followed the recipe exactly except for reducing sugars as people suggested (I tend to do that anyway on most recipes). They turned out beautifully and stayed chewy the next day. Took them to work and were gone in less than an hour. They tasted so much like the monster cookies I grew  up with. Again, not sure why people are adding flour to the recipe. Doesn't need it at all.

Good monster cookies! I switched 1/2 cup oats for flour and cut the brown sugar to 1 cup and white sugar to 3/4 cup, and used 1 tsp molasses instead of corn syrup. I also used mini chocolate chips and a 1/2 cup butterscotch.
2nd time-used all oats (gluten free) and m&ms, mini chocolate chips and butterscotch, and molasses. Still really good, slightly chewier. Awesome snack.

As recommended in the other reviews, I cut the brown sugar to 1 cup and the white sugar to 3/4 cup. Turns out perfect! A family favorite. Every time I make these, people rave over them and ask for the recipe. The ice cream scoop is a must, make sure you use one.

One of my grown sons' favorites!  Very easy.  The only change I made is I don't buy corn syrup so I substitute honey.  If I don't have the candy coated milk chocolate pieces I use raisins or nuts instead.  Made some for the roofers yesterday and they loved 'em too!  These are substantial, kind of like home-made Cliff bars when I use raisins or nuts!

These were good but different. I was weary about not having flour in this but it turned out ok. I used 1/2 instant oatmeal and half old fashioned. Otherwise made as stated. Everyone in family liked these but they weren't gaga over them either. Maybe I'll make them again or maybe I'll try a different recipe.

Great cookie!  I left out the corn syrup as I felt it was already sweet enough with all the sugar.  I cut down on the brown sugar to 1 cup.  I also added raisins.  Still in all.....it was a great cookie!

Used a medium cookie scoop, and baked for 13 minutes. Got fat, chewy cookies! Only issue I had, was the m&m's and chocolate chips did not all mix in, so was left with quite a few in the bottom of the bowl when done

These are wonderful!  I made them exactly as the recipe states, and I wouldn't change a thing.  My cookie scoop is about the size of a golf ball, so I baked mine for 12 minutes.  Perfect!

Great recipe! Since I didn't have many m&ms, I found done Halloween candy and threw them in there. The only change I did to the recipe was lessening the sugars: 1c granulated sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and it turned out not too sweet-just right!

I used honey instead of corn syrup. I also used one full, large bag (2 cups) of peanut M&M's and 3/4 cup of raisens instead of chocolate chips. Using parcement paper on top of the cookie sheets made these cookies turn out thick, chewy & delicious!

My boyfriend is a celiac and these are his favourite cookies.
I use 1/4 cup chocolate chips and a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of butterscotch chips. They turned out great and freeze awesome. First monster cookie batch I haven't had to downsize!

I have made these multiple times for my Parish bake sale. I always double the recipe. Never had any issues. Leave the batter mounted, if you flatten out the top, the cookie will crumble when you try to remove it from the pan.

Very good cookies. Trust the cooking time of 13-14 minutes for ice cream scoop sized big cookies. These won't look done and will be very soft out of the oven, but firm up a lot when cooled. First pan was in for 15 minutes and they ended up too hard when cooled, not chewy. Rest were perfect.

These cookies are amazing! So much flavor and they are still good 3 days later. Next time I might swap out the chocolate chips for butterscotch chips or raisins just cause those would taste good in the recipe too!

Removed butter since peanut butter is oily and cookies turned out great.  If you prefer to have a butter flavor added perhaps try adding some butter extract or if you like your cookies a little oily then maybe cut the butter down to a 1/4 cup.

My daughter just made these and they are great. She left out the m&m's and added an additional cup of chocolate chips. She was surprised to see that the recipe didn't call for flour! I guess they would be ideal for those with a gluten intolerance. Yummy!

Have made these several times. Always come out great! I have requests for these all the time.Have also made them several times since we moved to a high altitude, and they still come out great...which I cannot say as much for my chocolate chip cookies (even using the high altitude recipe).

Love, love, love these cookies!  I did cut back the sugar as suggested by another reviewer, 1 cup brown suger, 3/4 cup white sugar.  My kids didn't even notice the change in sugar.  These cookies stay so soft.  Fantastic!

Ugh! Without knowing better, I used Sixlets candies- What a melted mess of goo! I guess they cannot be used in baking. I picked them all out of the remaining dough and threw in some raisins as a substitute. Next time I'll use M & M's

Great recipe all the way around!  This recipe is spot-on for ingredients, cooking times, and number of monster cookies that the recipe will make!  Only thing I changed was to add a bit of salt. Not sure why others had trouble with the recipes because I have a wonderful batch of big cookies to share at my son's graduation party!

The cookies came out very nicely and I will make them again!  Only 4 stars because the directions are not as specific as I would like and I did alter some minor things.  First, I changed the servings to 36 and I softened the butter, used 1/4 C creamy PB and 1/2 C crunchy PB and used all quick cook oats. The directions don't mention either of these.  Second, I did not use all the white sugar, added about 1 tsp. of water, added an extra spoon full of PB and used Light corn syrup that has real vanilla (it is what I had).  I also did not have enough regular M&M's, so I used mini ones too.  Used a large spoon to make large dough balls and baked for about 13 minutes.  They were slightly browned on the bottoms and perfect! Yielded about 30 cookies.

A friend made these and brought it to our potluck and I absolutely loved them. She forwarded this recipe to me so my daughter and I set out on our culinary adventure to recreate it.  

We followed the recipe without changing a thing.  I noticed while the cookies were baking that ours were much fatter than my friends but I had high hopes regardless.  The end result was so disappointing.  The cookies were more peanut buttery than I remembered (not a fan of PB), and to my horror, crumbled in our hands after they cooled. Sadness.... and irritation because I just spend some dough (haha) on the ingredients!

I'm going to try this again but make the scoop smaller, and bake for a little longer.

these cookies are awesome!! I did use some others' suggestions. I cut the brown sugar to 1 1/8 cups packed, and white sugar to 3/4 cup. I left out the syrup. I also cut the oats to 3 3/4 cups and added 3/4 cup flour. Next time I think I will cut the peanut butter to 1 cup, because the peanut flavor was a bit too overpowering. I placed a sheet of wax paper on the cookie sheets and flattened the cookies before baking - this is a must.

Wish I could give this a a better review! However, the cookies stuck to the cookie sheet horribly! I tried two different cookie sheets and it did the same for each. I broke many of the cookies trying to unstick them :( Which was really unfortunate because they were for a camping trip. I even followed one reviewers advice to take them off the pan only a few minutes of being out of the oven--still didn't work! I even greased the pan once. However they did taste good. That's the only thing it has going for them!

Great Recipe!  If you're looking for an Amish cookie recipe, this is a good bet.  It's very similar to the Monster cookies that I've bought at our local Amish market.  I used 2C Quick Oats and 2.5C Rolled oats to give the cookies more firmness.  Also, I baked them at 325.  Using ROOM TEMP butter will ensure that the cookies do not flatten out when baked.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used butterscotch chips along with dark & white chocolate chips, and raisins!  My whole family loved these!

This is my favorite cookie recipe. My kids love them. I add a little bit extra peanut butter and a bag of Reese's peanut butter chips and omit the chocolate chips and candies! The chewiest, peanutiest cookies ever! MMMMM

Best cookies I've ever made! I reduced the brown sugar to 1 C, the white sugar to 3/4 C and substituted the corn syrup with maple syrup. Used a med. size ice cream scoop and they are chewy and moist and PERFECT! Will be making again and again I'm sure.

Read all the reviews and and was excited about these cookies (especially after tasting the delicious batter) but they just did not bake up well at all.  I don't usually have any trouble with cookies but they were just flat and hard.  Thought it was because I was making them too small but even after making them HUGE they still fell flat... so dissapointed because I really wanted them to turn out...  not sure what I did wrong...?  Followed the recipe exactly, put them in the fridge for a bit, used ice cream scoop size... 11 minutes was too little and they turned out doughy and would barely get off the pan but 12 minutes had them dark and hard and breaking apart!!  Won't be making again since I don't want to waste the ingredients!  :(

My kids along with everyone else who had these loved them.  
I used mini chocolate chips instead of the regular ones.  I also used 3/4 cups of smarties and added in 1/2 Reese's Pieces instead of just the 1 cup of coated candy.
The kids are already begging me to make them again!

my ice cream scoop only made 36 cookies.  I also added 3/4 cup of flour and cut the oats by that amount.  Used half and half quick and regular oats.  I didn't have corn syrup so used maple syrup.  The M & M's were the small ones.  Loved the recipe as adjusted. Baked 10 min but could be ovens or cookie sheets.

These cookies are really REALLY good.  I have to say, I was skeptical of the directions which do not call for creaming the butter and sugars together, but I followed them anyway and the cookies turned out great. 

* I reduced the amount of brown sugar by 1/4 cup and I used mini chocolate chips and mini reeses pieces, because I happened to have both.  

* I used a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop which made 24 BIG cookies.  But hey, they are "monster" cookies right?! They also baked for 14 minutes.

* Tips for other bakers:  Try to keep your oven at an even 350 degrees and rotate the pan(s) half way through.

These were a hit with a bunch of guys at a get together! Very easy to make and had a lot of flavor and variety all rolled into one cookie :) I followed the recipe and added one suggestion which was to refrigerate the dough for a few minutes before rolling out and baking! The cookies turned out pretty flat but tasted great! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I gave it five stars but with the tweaks i did to it. My mama & i changed it up a bit. Added some raisins (like in oatmeal raisin cookies) took out 1 of either choco chips and added Reese's Pieces cuz we're peanut butter lovers. Or just added mini m&ms. My kids DO love 'em but i don't want them to be too hyper so i had to change it up a bit. But they are delicious! =)

This is a delicious recipe but my cookies didnt seem to fluff up like the picture so I think next time I will use one tsp baking soda and one tsp baking powder. I  added butterscotch morsels and they were great. I love crunchy peanut butter so thats what I used. I ran out of rolled oats and used half quick oats and they turned out fine.

Super yummy!!!! I have used another Monster cookie recipe in the past, but these are way better!  I also found that 1 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar did the trick, and to cut down on the peanut buttery taste I used only 1 cup of pb.  This recipe is a keeper!

This monster cookie tastes almost like the ones my Granny used to make when I was a kid.  I never got her recipe but I have been on the hunt for a similar one for several years now and THIS IS IT!  This cookie have everything I love in it.  Make sure and use name brand M&M's.   Sometimes I also add macadamia nuts, white chocolate chips and coconut when I am feeling adventerous.  (The coconut makes them extra chewy).  Yummy!   Oh, and don't leave out the corn syrup....  it totally MAKES the cookie!

Halved the recipe, made as is EXCEPT used 1-1/4C oats and 1C flour, I really think this made all the difference.  Even with this substitution, the cookies were gooey and crumbly (just perfectly though).  Great taste, best when completely cooled.

I bake for the guys at my husband's work about once a week. When I sent these a few of the guys declared that these were the best things I'd sent yet and I never have anything come home. I used Reese's Pieces in place of M&Ms as that's what I had, but I think it would be great with either.

I used this recipe because I was out of flour and ended up liking it more than traditional chocolate chip cookies! My only advice is to reduce the oats and increase the extras--I added shredded coconut and white chocolate chunks. All-in-all, totally delicious.

This is a delicious recipe.  I made the original recipe for 72 cookies, used the ice cream scoop, and it really made only about 48 cookies (Just a heads up).  I took them out at 12 minutes and they still looked like balls, so I flattened them just a bit with a spoon and cooked them for 3 more minutes.  They turned out perfect and were medium sized, medium thickness cookies.

these cookies are now my second fav(no bake cookies are my first) and the kids love to help with them!  realistically, i'll probably bake these more often than anything. i chilled the dough to help thicken the cookies--otherwise they spread and break very easily.

These cookies are the best. The only change I made was I used a medium scoop instead of a large ice cream scoop. The medium scoop turns out a perfect 3 inch cookie. I have taken these cookies to many functions and they are always a hit and always the first to disappear. No changes to the ingredients need to be made. They are perfect as is!

My family loves these cookies. These are so easy to make and freeze well and are just as soft and delicious as if they came straight from the oven. A must keep. My daughter and I love getting in the kitchen and making these together. It is wonderful quality time we spend together!

Delicious!  I love to make the dough, roll into balls then freeze in freezer bags.  I doubled the vanilla and added cinnamon.  This is a new favorite at our house!

I followed this recipe with one exception, I used butter flavored crisco in place of the butter. I used rounded tablespoons full of dough to bake and baked for 11 minutes. I was not sure about the no flour part of this recipe, but I was wrong. Oh , and I used natural peanut butter. EXCELLENT! could not keep the kids away from them. Definately a keeper.

These cookies are soooooo good!  I made them exactly as written, using mini M&Ms and chocolate chips.  At first I was hesitant because there is no flour in this recipe, but it was worth the risk!  I will be keeping this one and making these over and over again!  Thanks for the great recipe Vicki!

Really good and easy. I used Reese pieces instead of M&M's and chunky peanut butter. Am mixing up our 2nd batch already. Freezes well.

Super yummy cookies!  I made them super big- Monster even!  I used 1/2 quick oats and 1/2 old fashioned.  Also i used choco chips, butterscotch chips and m&ms for a total of 2 cups.    Although I really like them, they had a bit of trouble cooking.  the cookies still looked under cooked at 15minutes, I ended up cooking them for over 20...still not fully cooked though.  maybe need to reduce the temp to 325 and bake for 25 minutes?    everyone loves 'em though! :)

Excellent cookies! I used less sugar, as other reviewers suggested (1 cup brown and just slightly over 1/2 cup white). I don't know how it is possible to get 72 cookies if using an ice cream scoop to make them- I got about 30 cookies. Also, I only baked them for 8-10 minutes (just until the browned slightly) and they stayed soft and chewy in an air tight container. This will now be my go-to monster cookie recipe!

These are yummy!! My husband loved them. I made the sugar changes other sugested - 1c brown sugar and 3/4c sugar. I used an ice cream scooper to make balls like the recipie asks and only yielded ~30 cookies.

These were okay but overly sweet for my tastes. The cookies were also a bit dry. That being said, everyone else absolutely loves them. UPDATE: I've made these again several times, reducing both sugars by half. They are still plenty sweet and the texture doesn't seem to suffer. The 'slice of bread in the bag' trick seems to keep them from drying out after the first day.

Quite tasty.  I've never had Monster Cookies before but mine turned out chewy and didn't spread out flat like some other reviewers stated.  It does make a ton of cookies, so I'll try freezing them as some of the comments said they freeze well.  I  might scale the recipe down next time, but other than that two thumbs up!  Thanks!

These were ok, but we didn't even eat half of them, so I know they were not great cookies.  We usually don't leave any leftovers.

These cookies were great!  They got crispy after a day and we had to microwave them or dunk them to soften them up again. However, other than that, they were great!

This is by far the best way to make Monster Cookies. I first tasted them in college when I made them with my roommates to take to our neighbors for Christmas. What memories! So for those of you who have college students, send them the ingredients and this recipe as a gift. They'll have a memory already and enjoy making more memories with the recipe to these amazing cookies.

I make these cookies for every holiday!  I use M&M's to match the holiday- red and green for Christmas, red/white/blue for the 4th of July, etc. The only thing I change is that I only put in 1 cup of brown sugar. Very good! Adults and kids both love them!!

My cookies did not turn out at all, 12 minutes was way too long.  They were flat like others said and hard.  I adjusted the time, moved the oven rack, adjusted the temperature and nothing, they were flat hard cookies.  Is there a trick to these cookies?  Please let me know if so, I love monster cookies and would like to know what went wrong.

GREAT cookie!  Make sure you allow enouhg time for them to cool - and on a totally flat surface.  I found that 13.5 minutes was the best for getting the chewy consistency.

Everyone loved these cookies! Like many reviewers, I cut both sugars by between 1/4 - 1/2 cup. I also had some butterscotch chips so I threw those in too. I used about half crunchy peanut butter, and I added about a half-cup of whole wheat flour. I'm sure they would have been just as good without these changes, but I would definitely make these cookies again using these alterations.

Oh My GOSH!!  Absolutely awesome.  I added some butterscotch chips, and used Splenda Brown sugar blend.  All the fussy people in this house, as well as my friends, loved it.  I am making them today with semi-chocolate chips and white chocolate chips - YUM!!

WOW!  This is an amazing cookie.  Taken out just before they look done ensures a deliciously chewy treat.  Instead of chocolate chips and m&m's I used a sweet and salty mix of peanuts, raisins, m&m's, mini chocolate and butterscotch chips, all totaling 2 cups.  This one is an energy packed morsel.

Definitely has a different kind of taste, more like a granola bar.  Made these for my husband this past Valentine's Day with red, white and pink M&Ms.

I don't know what the poor raters of this recipe are talking about.  These cookies are FANTASTIC! Everyone who has one raves about them and asks me for the recipe.  I made a few minor adjustments just based on my taste alone.  I doubled the amount of M&Ms to 2 cups.  Removed the chocolate chips altogether.  And added 1 cup of walnuts.

My family loved these cookies.  I took the advice of others and used a little less sugar and took them out of the oven before they looked done and let them finish on the cookie sheet.  They were soft and delicious both fresh out of the oven and from the freezer.  I will definitely make these again and again!

I just made these last night to bring to a work potluck, they were delicious! What was the corn syrup for? I didn't have any on hand so I left it out. They were just the right texture of chewiness! Thanks.

These cookies were excellent.  I made them as directed by the recipe and they turned out great.  I used my cookie scoop and used 2 scoops per one cookie, and the size was perfect.  Tastes great from the oven, but also great from the freezer, actually I think I like them that way the best.

Good - not great. These are the Paula Deen cookies. My husband loved them - they are super soft - I just do not prefer them.
I MIGHT make them again and use butterscotch chips rather than chocolate.

These were pretty good overall, but I was a little disappointed.  The first batch I put in the oven came out very flat and hard and were difficult to get off the cookie sheet.  After that, I made some adjustments by decreasing baking time to 11 minutes (they look a little underdone when you take them out) and taking the advice of others by making them LARGE.  Those cookies came out much better.  I will make them again, but I think next time I will also decrease the amount of sugar as suggested by others.

Quite a disappointing recipe.  I had been craving monster cookies for about 2 weeks...definitely not what I've had in the past.  If you're looking for a dry, flat monster cookie, then this is for you!

These were delicious!  I had a roommate in college that always made these and I was reminded of them the other day.  This recipe looked similar to the ones she used to make.  The only changes I made were to add 1/2C whole wheat flour and to reduce the sugars a bit.

These were really good. I made a couple of changes after reading the reviews, and added a half cup of flour, and I cut out a 1/4 cup of the white sugar. Since my peanut butter has no salt or sugar I added a half tsp of salt and the flavor was great. I used smarties and skor bits since that is what I had. The kids loved them and they were not too sweet at all. I use a silicone baking liner and the cookies some off very easily-no greasing needed, just let the cookies sit for about 2 or 3 minutes after coming out of the oven before you remove them from the baking sheet.

Fantastic recipe. My husband loved these. I had no problems with mixing and cookies stayed together nicely. I baked them on parchment paper and had no problem removing them to cooling racks. I will definitely be making these cookies again!

This was devoured by all who encountered it and I received an overwhelming of complements for its flavor. However, I had a problem with getting the cookies to stay together. A day after I baked them they were still falling apart and by the end of the day after I had brought them to school they had turned into big crumbs (I told people it was a type of granola). I think I will make this again but next time use a little flour.

Five stars for taste, 4 stars for everything else. They were kind of crumbly and wanted to fall apart when removing from pan. Also the first batch stuck so I had to well grease the pan. Was hard to mix as well and I think the last pan had more baking soda because it didn't mix in very well despite mixing for 10 mins.

it was ok.  without using parchment paper they stick to the pan really really badly, and unless i overcooked them they would fall apart even after being cooled.  i don't think i will make this one again.

These are excellent, and the recipe makes dozens of big delicious cookies.  I substituted the butter for butter-flavored shortening and did add 1/4 c. of flour.  I fed half to my family and packaged the other half for a bake sale. I'll make these again and again.

Great recipe! The cookies were a hit!

I read all the reviews and did add a 1/2 cup of flour to the recipe only because I only had 3 and 3/4 cup of oatmeal versus what was called for in the recipe. I really think that helped the dough stay togther better. The ice cream scoop worked well and made for nice size cookies. We will make this one a lot!

These cookies were great.  My daughter does not like peanut butter, but thought these were great especially with a big glass of milk.  I didn't change the recipe at all.

I almost didn't make these because there wasn't any flour, but the good reviews swayed me. I'm glad I did because these are unique and delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added a little more corn syrup for an even sweeter taste. the ice cream scoop is not necessary. the dough is too sticky for it to work anyway.

We loved this recipe!  So easy to make and so good!  We used chunky peanut butter and they are perfect!  Not too flat and crispy - just right!  Thanks!

I have had frozen batter that is better. Not by much though. They are good but I also used Splenda for baking and light PB. I dont know if this affected the batter. I only got 2 dozen lg cookies. I would make again but try adding flower as another person recomended.

Great!  The Best!  I made them exactly according to the recipe and they were wonderful.  I had lost my old recipe I used years ago and these were definitely it.

I made this recipe for a family reunion, and the quantity was just right! And a hit with all 40 people--I handed the recipe out to dozens of people!

For Taste, I'd give these cookies a 5 star, but it's a wee bit of a challenging cookie to hold together, (consistency), and you have to like peanut butter. I did cut back on the PB by 1/4 cup, and I added 1/4 cup of flour and a dash of Heath bits. I think raisins would be a wonderful addition too! HINT: I bake cookies on a stone, and I left the cookies for a good 3-4 minutes before transferring to a rack. Let them sit to firm up or they may crumble apart on you.

This is one yummy cookie loaded with chocolate chips and candy pieces. My kids and husband thought they were great! Makes a big batch and leftovers freeze well. I followed the recipe's amounts as called for but used butter flavored shorting in place of the butter.  I'll be baking these again soon.

Didn't hold up in the oven; either were too gooey or too crisp. I'll stick to my mom's recipe instead.

This is my favourite. I have taken them to work and had to pass the recipe alot of times, even though I use a little more of the oatmeal.

Wonderful!  A hit with my seven children!  They ask for more, so I just freeze half the batch for later.
  Thanks for sharing!
