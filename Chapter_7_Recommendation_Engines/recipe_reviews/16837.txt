We LOVED these onions!  I know.  Just two ingredients.  But when you are grilling, these work out just perfectly.   I served these with Juicy Chicken from this site and sticky rice (Calrose).  This was a yummy dinner, and we'll look forward to leftovers tomorrow either for lunch or for dinner.

I halved the recipe as there would only be two adults.  I also marinated only 30 minutes as the natives were restless.  These onions were fabulous.  I cooked them on the upper rack until my steak was nearly done, then I cranked up the side of the grill these were on and put them on the lower burner to carmelize.  This is an absolutely FABULOUS addition for steak, fajitas or even salads.  This goes with my 'tossing something on the grill' meals now!  THANKS!

I love when grilled onions get all nice and kinda charred on the grill. Nice change from the usual olive oil, salt and pepper that I usually use. Thanks!

All we really tasted was the italian dressing (used Kraft), which overpowered the delicate sweetness of our local Walla Walla sweet onions.

Such a simple thing to do, marinate and grill thick onion slices. Wow did they take my burger to the next level!
