I like to mash the fruit cocktail just a bit with a potato masher.  Less "chunky" that way.  Great recipe

Sorry, but this was a BIG disappointment. It came out too sugary and dense, like a fruitcake.

Tip #1: If you don't have self-rising flour, just add 1 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/14 tsp salt for every cup of flour in a recipe. :)
Tip#2: It didn't work too well to convert to a bundt pan, or I needed to increase the time from 45 min to 55. Tasted pretty good anyway! Almost like bread pudding.

Wonderful cake! I made a sauce of 1/4c butter, 1/2c sugar and 1/4c buttermilk. Boiled it for 5 minutes and added a tsp of vanilla. I poked holes in the cake with a fork while still hot and poured it over the cake. Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved it.  I made half.  I didn't have fruit cocktail so used mandarin oranges.  I made an orange glaze for the top to use up the canned fruit juice.
