This is my recipe and I just wanted to note a few things.  All Recipes has changed a few quantities - you many want to use a but more garlic salt as well as some onion salt.  Also - be liberal with oregano and black pepper.  This dish is meant to be lightly fried and then baked.  If you only fry it, it will be tougher.  It is also meant to be s soft breading (not soggy)not crispy, but that, of course, is personal perference.  In my family is is usually served with applesauce, mashed potatoes, and green beans.

I made this dish last night for dinner and changed the recipe considerably; here's what I did:  I followed the recipe by slicing the pork and pounding each piece out, I salt and peppered each piece also.  Then I dredged the pork in flour, then in egg mixed with a large clove of garlic and about a Tbsp. of water.  Last, I dredged each pork slice in bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  I added butter and olive oil to my pan and cooked it until golden brown.  I skipped baking the pork as the pieces were so thin, by the time they were done browning, they were cooked.  I skipped the "breadings" part too.  I served the pork on a big platter sprinkled with chopped Italian parsley and some lemon wedges....our dinner guests loved it and so did we.

Breaded pork is always a hit with my husband and I've been making pork chops like this for years. So, when I saw this recipe I decided to do it the same way, but instead of using chops using the tenderloin pounded down just a bit. I always use Italian style bread crumbs and just eyeball extra seasonings to add like garlic powder, cracked black pepper, dried parsley, Italian seasoning and some grated Parmesan cheese. I always dip my pork chops into the egg/milk mixture then the seasoned bread crumbs and then repeat that procedure (double dipping). This gives the pork a thick breading and keeps it moist while baking. To cut calories and time I spray the bottom of a glass baking dish with Pam, place the breaded pork in (no frying needed) then spray the pork with a little Pam, cook at 350 for 20 minutes, turn and cook for another 20 - 25 minutes depending on thickness. They'll come out moist and tender. I also do the "breadings" thing again without the frying. I also don't cover my pork while it's baking. Overall, a really good recipe!

Extremly soggy, I recommend not lining pan with foil, do not cover, and bake a little higher with less time. Oil should be very hot when you fry it at first. This will seal in juices to keep the pork moist durning baking.

Wow!  Great pork medallions.  I made a 2 1/2 lb tenderloin and still had tons of egg wash left over (maybe cut that in half) and had to double the breading ingredients.  I added a few extra spices like garlic and onion powder and also some parmesan cheese.  It got rave reviews.  I only covered the pan for 1/2 the baking time.  It cooked sooner than the recipe said so watch your meat thermometer.  Very tender and delicious.  This goes into my favorite recipe file.

I've been looking for this recipe for years now - as my mom used to make this ALL the time when I was kid!

The only thing that DIDN'T work well (and why I didn't give 5 stars) were the "breadings" - they turned out like a rubbery "scrambled egg" topping (which is what they basically are)...

I realize that the recipe calls for the remaining large amount of eggs and bread crumb mixture to be used as "breadings" added in at the end - but I would reccommend not adding them back to the dish as a topping.  But that's just my personal opinion ;);)

Pretty good. My husband loved it. I too added parm cheese to the bread crumbs and some fresh garlic thought it could use a bit more salt next time. Would defiantly make again!!!

This was my first time making breaded pork tenderloin, and my family loved it.  To save yourself a lot of work, go to a butcher to get your tenderloin, they cut it and pound it out for you!!

Even my preschoolers like it!  After reading suggestions, I added 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  Also, I had 2 pork tenderloins that added up to 1 1/2 lbs. and because the slices were small, it did take more bread crumbs than the recipe allows for.  It will depend on how many slices you have.

Hands down the best piece of pork tenderloin I've ever eaten! I checked mine after 35 minutes at 325 and it was done. I will definitely be making this again (and again, and again). Thanks!!

We loved it!  So fast and easy.  I did add more bread crumbs and It. seasoning and garlic salt and pepper.  I covered as recipe called for and they came out moist and tender. I really didn't understand the 'breadings' but I did it any way so.... glad I did.  Loved every thing about this recipe will make again and again.

Delicious!  We've been following this recipe for years, and it's one of my favorites!  I do substitute thinly sliced pork chops, instead of the tenderloin.  Such a good recipe that everyone in the family (including my picky children) loves!

I miss the Pork Tenderloin sandwiches we would get where we grew up in Indiana. Those were always deep-fried. This recipe has all the flavor without being deep-fried. It was a huge hit with my family. Looking forward to making this recipe again soon.

We enjoyed this recipe tonight for dinner. I followed some of the suggestions, but probably would have done them on my own. 1. added a flour dredge before the egg wash. 2. add more seasoning to the breadcrumbs (because we like things that way). I added italian seasonings, oregano, and seasoned pepper. 3. fried in olive oil/butter. Thanks for the recipe. yum!

Pretty good overall except that breading is a little soggy.  The first time I made it I slightly covered it w/ foil.  The second time I made it I didn't cover it at all, but it still came out a little soggy.  Next time I won't line the pan with foil to see what happens.  Also, I would suggest more salt, and some garlic cloves for better flavor.

Absolutely wonderful. This is how we ate pork chops when I was a kid and I rarely cook them that way now. This gave me a chance to remember the old days. I used homemade breadcrumbs, seasoned myself. Pounded the pork thin, dredged in flour, then into the egg, then into the crumbs. Sauteed quickly, no need to go into the oven because they were very thin. This would be wonderful in pasta sauce then mozzarella & parmesan cheese, I think you know where I'm going with this!

i make this recipe all the time, the only thing i would change is to not pound them out too thin, i would say about 3/4" thick is perfect, maybe shorten the baking time to about 20min. or else they get too tough, other than that they're perfect!

I'm notorious for drying out pork..but this one was perfect. Really tasty, really tender and juicy. I added parm cheese and just eyeballed the dry ingredients, as other people mentioned they did. I also cut the peices alittle thicker (like 1 in. each) so that they would be 1/2 after pounding. Lastly, I took someone's advice and baked for 350 for 20 min instead of the longer timeframe. (but I still covered it, and I did let it sit, covered, for a few minutes before serving. I really recommend this recipe!! Delish!

Great recipe! Will be good with veal too. I agree w/Danielle .. keys are pepper, garlic powder, and moist bread crumbs.

I am an impatient chef, so I baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Wonderful! Will make a great cold snack too.

My husband practically ate the whole tenderloin himself. The prep time really wasn't that bad as long as you allot enough time for it. I agree with a previous reviewer that a nice white wine sauce would taste nice over it.

Yum.  My husband and I both loved this dish.  I needed much more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for.  Makes for good leftovers.

I followed a review that said to bake at 350 for 20mins...very tender and flavorful!  Next time, I will try this a little thicker tenderloins and bake for 30-35 mins. My husband is a very meat and potatoes person, and he loves this recipe.

I listened to others and cut the cooking time considerably and left it uncovered, that was definitely the right thing to do - they would have been like charcoal if they had cooked a full 45 minutes!  I also wasn't so fond of the "breadings".  The breaded pork itself worked pretty well but it stuck to the tin foil, and honestly I think a little sage as well as parmesan cheese enhances the flavor vs. just italian seasonings + oregano.

I did not pound the pork at all. I cut in quarter inch rounds and followed the rest of the recipe...however, I did NOT put them in the oven because they were all ready done. Nice and juicy! I got rave reviews!

AMAZING!!  This was the first time I made pork tenderloin...ever...I will use this recipe from now on!  I did add some parmesan cheese to the breading, and I didn't make the 'breadings', but it turned out wonderful!

I thought it was a fabulous starter recipe since I had never made pork this way. I dredged in flour first, then egg wash mixed with water.Instead of bread crumbs I used japanese panko flakes (which helps with the crunchy issue some people had) mixed with a cajun seasoning, garlic powder, red pepper and a bit of oregano.
Lightly sauteed in olive oil and butter then baked as directed.
Thank you again for giving me a new way to make pork tenderloin without spending the whole day marinating.
I made a white wine sauce from deglazing the pan to have on the side.
My husbnd absolutely loved it!!!
Thnk you so much

Really enjoyed this and will make it again.  Most pork tenderloins come in packages of 2, about a pound each so I had to use more bread crumbs, seasonings and oil.  Other than that followed the recipe pretty closely.  Didn't cook up the rest of the egg and crumbs....also I used a foil lined cookie sheet in the oven and just covered it with foil for the first 20 minutes and then took the foil off so the meat would get nice and brown.  Thanks!

We thought that this was  great.  I don't care for oregano so I used rosemary.  Was fantastic with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Thanks Always Cooking (a quality cook) for the recommedation.  And thanks Danielle for the great recipe!  I can't wait to make it with chicken tenders.

Family raved over this. Made only minor changes - olive oil replaced vegetable oil, added minced garlic to flavor the oil, no milk, just a bit of water added to the beaten eggs. Thanks for a very tasty recipe!

An old family favorite like my husband's mom always used to make for him.  We make it without the egg step and it makes for a perfect, light coating on the pork.  We also pan fry it with half butter/half oil...yummy!  Definitely needs to be served with applesauce on the side.  A great comfort meal...

Pretty good. No need to pound meat if you've cut it to only 1/4 inch. Fry in olive oil and don't cover - lay on a tray with aluminum foil or a Silpat, preferrably. Also, only needs about 35 mins at 325. But not bad! Wife and kids liked it and they don't usually like pork at all.

Seems like this would be best just to cook in the skillet and forgo the whole baking process. Didn't think it was that flavorful even though I added more oregano. Needed more salt as well. Won't make this again.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  Way too much work for the end result.  I also felt that it needed something - maybe some sort of sauce.

Very tasty recipe.  I used a teriyaki tenderloin instead of the regular kind, which gave it a very nice distinct flavor.  i took the foil off after twenty minutes, and only the bottom tenderloins were soggy.  Still very good though, and tender enough to cut with a fork.

This was yummy and satisfying, but there was more work involved (the pounding and pan-frying, plus 45 minutes in the oven) than I anticipated.  A good recipe, but not necessarily worth all the time and effort.

My family loved this recipe!  I have very picky eaters (ages 3 and 5) and they went back for seconds.  My husband also loved it.  I didn't bake it as long as the recipe said and also took the foil off the top towards the end to make it crispier and it turned out great.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  I usually just fry in butter on the stove but that seems to take forever.  This was quick and everyone just loved it.  I used more bread crumbs than it called for and more oil for frying.  Next time I will take the foil off for the last 15 to 20 minutes so that they are more crispy.  YUM YUM

It was great!!! I didn't pound it, and only cooked it for 30 minutes! I also didn't cover it tightly with foil, because it would make the breading soggy. I just set a piece of foil over the top loosely on an angle! Great and Easy!!!!

Excellent! Made with bone in 3/4 " chops. Followed recommended flour, egg, crumb mix ( added garlic powder, onion powder & Italian seasoning).  Browned each side and finished in 325* oven for 15 minutes

It's a very good recipe. I think too many people spend too much time changing it and telling us all of the changes they made. There is a separate page for that. My whole family liked this dish, and we used them to make delicious tenderloin sanswiches that were much better than most restaurants :) I did find that they were done in less than 15 min though . Thanks for sharing!

This is an old family favorite.   You have to try this substitution...  Instead of garlic salt..use garlic powder. Include kosher or sea salt to taste. Instead of oragono...use ground rosemary...it makes the whole recipe.    Ground rosemary is hard to find.  I buy dried rosemary sticks and grind them in my bullet.

This was pretty tasty. The breading could have been a little crispier so maybe next time I'll do what another reviewer said and only leave it covered half the time while baking. It could maybe be dressed up a bit too with a little more spices. Served with bisquits and mashed potatoes.

After a few bites, my husband asked that I make pork tenderloin like this from now on.  I thought it was pretty good, but wasn't quite as wow-ed as he was, although I did appreciate just how juicy and tender the meat was.  Maybe next time I'll play around with a sauce to drizzle over it.

I prepared this in the morning when I had more time. Then when I was ready to fix dinner, all I had to do was put it in the oven & bake. I'm just learning how to cook. I used the parmesan cheese & added rosemary, sage, & thyme. I didn't like the rosemary. I don't know spices so I don't always know what to use. I used onion powder instead of garlic salt (I'm allergic to garlic). I didn't pound the meat but it was very tender. The coating was tasty, but the meat had no flavor.

I followed the recipe and it was dry and bland.  The "breading" in the recipe was odd.

My husband and I enjoyed this a lot.  It was quite easy to make and very tasty.  I added parmesan cheese and extra seasonings, thanks to the other reviews.  We will definitely make this again.

Pretty darned good recipe, it was strange for me to have pork breaded in this way.  But it hit the spot.  Even my picky fiance dug it, and she only eats stuff like mac and cheese.

I changed it a bit by using plain breadcrumbs, but added rosemary and Italian seasonings to the crumbs. Also, I added ham and Swiss cheese - after each slice of pork, I inserted a thin slice of ham folded in half with Swiss cheese in the middle. It makes for an easy type of cordon bleu, and the sauce was excellent.

This recipe was amazing! My family loved it, even the very picky 8 & 2 year olds!!! I also "double dipped" the pork which, I think, made it so much better. Crispy on the outside & incredibly moist on the inside.

WAY too much oregano. I might try this again without any oregano. Also, if cut into 1/4" pieces, I don't think they need to be thinned.

Wonderful Flavor and oh so tender!! I never thought to pond out the medallions. Great Idea. Really stretches the servings too. Hope they all like it as much as I did. Bringing it to a church function.  I just added a little more grated romano to the breading. All I had was half and half in the fridge so i used it instead of milk. Yummy.

Great easy recipe and delicious!
the only changes I made were to a bit of rosemary, and to fry it in a cast iron skillet and then place into oven instead of using baking pan.

This was a good recipe.  My only complaint was that the pieces of pork were so small and it seemed to take me forever to cook it all.  However, the flavor was very good.  I will probably try it again.

Wow, this was excellent.  I used the egg wash and olive oil as others suggested, but other than that followed the recipe.  There's only three us, so I did wind up with leftovers, and they reheated well.

My main issue with the recipe was the quantity of the breadcrumbs called for, and of the egg/milk mixture.  I only used 1 pound of meat, but required twice as many breadcrumbs, and had lots of egg mix left over!  For the full recipe, I think I would almost triple the breadcrumbs, and halve the egg mixture.  On a side note, grated, slightly stale bread actually made a better crumb than shop-bought, dried breadcrumbs.  I'll probably do it that way in future.

Good recipe...pork came out tender, flavor was definitely there.  I may have added too much though, as the oregano was slightly overpowering for my taste.  (I also added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, & onion powder).  I uncovered pork for last 5 minutes, turned up the temperature to 375, then broiled for a few minutes at the end.  The crust was not soggy nor crunchy.  Thanks for sharing, Danielle.

This is wonderful recipe, I never thought to 
put breading on pork tenderloin.I did put Asian
BBQ sauce on first then added the bread crumbs,
also I coverd the pork with a foil tent for the
first half of cooking time so it wouldnot brown
to fast it was great thanks for tip.

My kids loved this recipe.  It was a nice way to cook the tenderloin without needing to marinade (which is how I usually cook it).  We all agreed, however, that it could use a little thin white wine gravy (maybe with mushroom for us grown-ups) to make it perfect.  I will definitely make this again!

I also love this recipe.  It's the one I use most every time I cook pork.  I've found that I don't need to cook it for as long as the recipe says, but it could be my oven.  I sometimes add extra thyme and garlic salt to give additional flavor.  This is a great recipe!

This is a very tasty treat!  I substituted boneless pork steaks & use crushed Italian croutons for the bread crumbs & it was scrumptious!  The meat ends up butter-knife tender!  Definitely will be a regular around our house.

I thought it turned out too mushy.  By covering it tightly in the oven like the recipe states, it caused a lot of moisture in the pan, and made the bread really soggy. I also cut the baking time in 1/2 (20 minutes).  If I had done it the whole 45 minutes, it would have been way overdone!

This is a great recipe-but tenderloin is so tender
that you don't need to pound it before frying. I've also used this cooking method for pork chops
and chicken.To keep extra moist, add about a 1/4
cup chicken broth to baking dish.

I went the extra yard and followed this recipe as a base and then applied kelcampbells additions.

The garlic in the fresh squeezed garlic in the egg wash and the parmesan in the bread crumbs put this one over the top.

Ive been making this for years. Learned from my mom & she was also making for years. Just a note, you can omit the oven baking. They really only take about 5 minutes to cook in fry pan. I also add parmesan to the bread crumbs!!

Hubs and I really like this.  It's not altogether different than dredges I use for other things, but the oregano is a nice touch.  For us, 2 T is too much oregano.  I used no more than 1T and it was plenty.  Also baked for only 30 mins. after browning and that was plenty.  Will consider removing the foil half way through baking next time, as the pork does get moist to the point of soggy and pooling juices in the pan.  Still good, and will make again.

We made this recipe almost exactly as written, but only 20 minutes in the oven was enough baking time.  We added pasta sauce, topped with shredded mozzarella and left in the oven until melted. Served alongside spaghetti.  DH says best spaghetti dinner ever.  The pasta sauce was also from this site, Stephanie’s Freezer Spaghetti Sauce. It’s amazing.

I would make this again, but would not use oregano. Didn't like it on pork.  Also, I would use more spices as I couldn't taste any, except for the oregano, that's all I tasted.

This was wonderful I left out the milk and used 1 T Water and added onion powder and parmesan cheese.  Very tasty, very tender and juicy.

Great recipe!  I mainly followed the ingredient list - not so much the measurements.  Added more garlic salt and oregano - needed more bread crumbs.  Everyone in my family loved it, even the pickiest eaters.  Little ones even had seconds, and easy to chew for a toddler.  Gone fast!  Need to make two tenderloins next time.

This is good but I think I will stick to grilling my pork tenderloin. The breading does not stick to the tenderloin very well. The flavor was good but a bit bland.

Good but not great.  It was a lot of work/time involved for something that came out simply okay.  I've had just as good results adding a few of my favorite spices to some shake and bake and a whole lot less effort & mess.

Great recipe! I did not cover or line with foil, cooked at a higher temperature.  I tried the "breadings" but my husband and I scraped them off.  I also added some parmesan cheese and used more oregano and garlic salt to the crumb mixture. I also made gravy with beef bullion cubes to pour on top.  Husband loved it.  Thanks Danielle this is a new favorite!

The pork tasted wonderful!  Next time I make it, I think I'll lightly cover with foil, since the breading was a little soggy.  However, the juicyness and overall flavor well made up for any soggyness!  I'd recommend to anyone!

I live in a group house - 5 adults, 2 kids and everyone loved it.

A little soggy tho, I tried venting the foil as recommended, but didn't seem to help much.  Will experiment in the future to make it crispier.

Added sage and used garlic powder instead of salt to cut down on sodium.  

Topped with brown gravy and mushrooms - yumm!

The whole family loved it!  Had a problem with the breading though.  When I tryed to fry it to brown it, the breading stuck to the pan and not to the pork.  I put oil in the pan, maybe just not enough oil.  Just spooned the breading on top of the pork and baked.  Still wonderful!
