This recipe is SOOOO good!! So many fresh vegetables, this is a MUST TRY!  I added a can of light kidney beans and used 2 peppers, cuz I love em.
I also added a good bottle of beer after I sauted the peppers and onions, I think it always adds great flavor to chili.

This is a must have for my recipe collection! I made it for my boyfriend and he LOVED it. The mixture of vegetables in this recipe was delighful. I didn't have the mushrooms and it still turned ot great. 

My boyfriend likes really spicy food so I added a tablespoon or so extra and also some red pepper. It was perfect! 

I served it over rice and it made for a very hearty meal. I would definitely make this again. 

It was the best vegetarian chili I have attempted to make.

I made this recipe last summer and absolutely loved it - I can't remember if I altered anything or not though.  I made it again this week and did not enjoy it like I remembered it - it was too watery this time - I will not fault the recipe though as this was more than likely my error since I loved this recipe the first time I made it.  The first time I thought it was very flavorful and while it's all beans and veggies, I found it to be very filling and satisfying.  I will try this again and had I not screwed up I would have given this 5 stars.

This was the first chilly recipe I ever made and was really great! I did use a bit more vegies and some extra chilly, and served it with brown rice, light sour cream, lettuce and diced mozzarella cheese. Good vegetarian option for dinner!

This is a great recipe.  I ususally use a can of black beans and a can each of light and dark kidney beans.  I also use both a red and green bell pepper and sometimes add a cup of corn.

YUM!  Fresh garden and farmer's market veggies make this chili shine!  Lots of chopping, but worth it!  Used chicken broth instead of water/wine and added 1 can tomato sauce.  Simmered, covered to make everything tender.  Used the immersion blender for a little whip - made everything creamy, but still chunky.  Adding the pre-cooked rice to the bottom of the dish and than ladle the chili over and top with cheddar cheese = yummy & healthy!  Will make again!!

Made this during the harsh Canadian winter of 2010 and it was great! Used 2 cups stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. For the liquid I used 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup Cabernet Sauvignon, 1/2 cup flat beer. Also added 1 fresh green chile minced. Served over rice and topped with grated cheddar.

This was delicious and easy.  I took it to work thinking it would last a couple of days and it disappeared within a few hours with everyone raving about how good it was (this from a very carnivorous crowd!).

My friends were skeptical when they first found out it was vegetarian and I made enough for 12 people... after they'd already finished dinner. I took off to watch a film for 2 hours, and when I came back, the entire pot was clean!  Need I say more?  By the way, adding homemade guacamole, shredded Tillamook cheddar cheese, and Knudsen sour cream really helped the consistency and flavor. (I forgot to add salt in the guac too!)

Very good and very healthy! Score two! I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the fresh (we don't have them in farmer's markets yet here) and added a can of red kidney beans (I love lots of beans in chili). I did use wine, a Shiraz which was a little too sweet for my tastes but turned out fine in the chili. Also I used WAY less cilantro, probably used less then a quarter cup and worked fine. It really needed some more depth of spices, I added some seasoned salt, oregano, thyme and basil, although just a bit since I didn't want to turn this into an Italian sauce! Chili powder, cumin and cilantro are still the stars. Very happy with the result. Used the suggestion of serving on brown rice, something I've never done with chili before, but that was great with this recipe! I'll be making this often!

A friend of mine made a similar recipe years ago, which she never shared, bless her heart. Therefore, I've been on the lookout for a nice vegetarian chili ever since. This one looked promising.  I was a little concerned about the number of ingredients at first blush, however, this was WAY simple! It is hard for me to use a recipe without changing it the first time around. So, I held myself back as much as possible today. I really enjoyed making this chili recipe! It makes a generous amount so I'm pleased I resisted the temptation to double the recipe.  I cook for a small family with a wide range of spice tolerance. This was just right for my mild-loving mother-in-law yet flavorful enough for my spice-loving husband. I served it over brown rice as suggested and garnished with sharp cheddar cheese. Wonderful, yummy sounds and smiling faces all around!   Next time, to increase the protein content, I'll add a bag of frozen veggie protein (Morningstar or Boca) to the basic recipe. NO Additional changes, which is an amazing statement coming from me. This recipe is a keeper!

Husband wanted something with a lot of cilantro so I thought I'd give this a try even though it didn't seem appealing to me. Boy was I wrong- it was absolutely delicious! We all wanted more leftovers for next time so here are the 3 adjustments I made: 2 cans of beans (simply organic black, and simply organic 3 bean). Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used 2 (10oz) cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis. This made it real spicy so I omitted the cayenne. Instead of 1 cup of water, I used 1 cup of chicken stock (we are not vegetarians). Each bowl is topped with Mexican blend shredded cheese, a dollup of sour cream, and a slice of avocado.

One of my all time AllRecipes favorites.  I've made this many times and it always turns out awesome.  The only change I make is I use 1 cup fresh tomato and one can of fire roasted tomatoes with juice and then add water to equal one cup.  I LOVE this recipe!

I've made this recipe as is and with some changes. Both are excellent. For the non-vegan, I added a can of tomato puree, a can of cream of chicken, summer squash, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 T of unsweetened cocoa, 1 T of Chipolte Seasoning, upped the cayenne and black pepper to 1 tsp, and added browned and drained mild sausage. Have fun with it or stick to it by the letter - delicious either way!

My husband and I just tried this for dinner tonight and we both love it! Since I'm a vegetarian and he isn't, it's wonderful when we find a healthy recipe we can both enjoy together. We had it over rice with a little shredded Fiesta Cheese on top. (Remember, fellow vegetarians... rice and beans are a great source of high quality protein, and the cheese adds some calcium!) 

RECIPE MODIFICATIONS: I added an extra can of black beans since one just didn't look like it would be enough. We like our chili spicy, so I added about twice as much of all of the spices as was recommended, and substituted a generous dose of Tony Chachere's More Spice seasoning instead of the salt and pepper. Turned out having a great little kick to it! We will definitely be adding this to our list of favorite recipes and making it again!

Make sure you add extra spices, mine turned out a little bland but very good.  I would add red pepper and salt at least for the next time I make this dish.  Served over short grain brown rice. Very healthy dinner!

This recipe has a very good base, so I'm sure it's very good. Beware of the kind of chili that you are using, though! Mine was unfortunately a crazy hot mix, so 2 tablespoons made the chili impossible to eat, even after doubling all of the other ingredients. Note: My husband puts hot sauce on everything and he wasn't even able to eat more than a spoonful of chili! But if we put the burn aside, it was good!

Pretty good! I left out the mushrooms and bell peppers because I didn't have any. I used soaked black beans instead of canned (I like the texture better), fresh corn and some canned tomatoes to round out my lone fresh one.  A great way to use some of my garden veggies. I'll make it again!

Ok as is. I simmered the dish for 15 extra minutes to reduce some of the water in the pot.  I added another tbls of chili powder and half a can of tomato paste as I found it pretty bland.

Excellent chili!  I've made this twice, both times with wine.  I altered the ingredients slightly (didn't use pepper because I don't like it), but in general followed the recipe.

This was awesome!!  I was in the mood for something filling without the meat, and this was perfect!  I love that it is full of veggies and not overly-heavy on the beans or spices - a nice change of pace from traditional chili!  This one is getting added to the rotation, for sure!!  Very yummy! :)

This recipe was wonderful.  I added another can of beans, cooked potatoes, and salsa.  This a great recipe to use when you've got cooked veggies in your fridge and you are looking for a way to perk them up.  Also it reminds you that chili can be great in the summer too!

This is a great recipe without any changes but is also a great base to change it up to your taste. I add a little cocoa powder to enhance the flavor.

I made this the other night! I used black beans & garbanzo beans (chickpeas). I also added corn and peas (that I had left over). It came out yummy, I did add more chili powder & included paprika & white vinegar, I did not use cilantro. Others tried it & they are not vegetarian but still enjoyed it.

This recipe was really tasty. I didn’t have black beans, so I put in kidney beans. I also added about a tablespoon of tomato paste and it came out great!  I’ll definitely be making this recipe again!

I wasn't sure how this will turn out but it was delicious! I reduced the chili powder to a tablespoon because I want my 2 year old to be able to enjoy it as well. I instead added some thyme, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder. I also added a table spoon of brown sugar. I added a can of light beer instead of water. My husband added frank hot sauce in his bowl and I added sriracha sauce in mine to make it spicier for us and it was delicious. My meat loving husband wants me to make this every week!

This was delicious! Since I'm Vegetarian, I'm always eating Black beans so I tried White Kidney beans in this dish and it was great. The chopping of veggies takes awhile but you should use the exact measurements for the proportions and flavors to work.

Very nice dish with mostly fresh vegetables.  I really didn't change anything but I would use a little less liquid next time.  It didn't thicken enough for a chili but still tasted great.  I did not make rice with it but served it with bread.  Very tasty.

Meal turned out good. We had the chili with chicken and rice. Kids liked it. Wife said it was ok. I liked all the veggies that come with the dish but I did not get a whole lot of flavor out of it. Would I do it again?  I would probably try others first to compare

I love vegetarian chili and this was one delicious. I just wish this recipe was more user-friendly (i.e. call for 1 bell pepper, chopped, instead of 1 cup etc.). And one cup of cilantro seems a bit extreme..

This was superb! I doubled all the veggies, threw in a yellow squash and used veggie stock instead of wine or water, added in a lot of cayenne pepper (we like it spicy!). I let this simmer for an hour and served it as suggested over rice and with shredded cheese and sour cream for my bf, I just ate it as is. Love this recipe so much, thank you!

I've made this multiple times and each time it's amazing.  Even my meat eating husband likes it.  What I like most about it is the use of fresh ingredients instead of relying on canned flavors.  I usually add a can of chickpeas and double the zucchini and peppers to make it extra hearty.  Just a word of caution, if you add a cup of wine, make sure you cook off all the alcohol before you bring it to work for lunch!

Delicious! I have a similar vegetarian chili recipe that I've been making for years. Like that one, I also added a few bay leaves and 1-2 tblsp of brown sugar. I used chicken broth in place of the water, omitted the mushrooms and cut back a bit on the garlic. The cooking time was just right. Topping this with shredded cheese and some sour cream on the side will be great additions, too.

Wow, this was amazing. I halved the cumin & chili powder b/c my husband does not like any heat and I even forgot to add any salt or pepper--and it was still packed with flavor! I ate with feta cheese and Ritz crackers & loved it. I will definitely make this again! I plan to try with brown rice next time.

Very good recipe -- lots of flavour variety and an easy/quick prep. We made ours in the crock pot instead of on stovetop and added in rice to the leftovers to thicken it up.  We'll definitely make this one again!

I loved this soup. It was a wonderful way to use veggies from the garden.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I substituted eggplant.  Not a big cilantro fan so I ommited it. Also used extra tomatoes. Still turned out great.  Even hubby (who is known to say "where's the meat?") liked it.

This turned out really well and was a great way to empty the fridge of vegetables that were about to go bad.  I reduced the amount of cilantro because I find it easily over-powering and increased the amount of tomatoes.
