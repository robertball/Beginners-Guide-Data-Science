Good recipe, but the sodium content is sky-high (primarily from the canned baked beans).  It's easy to make the same recipe with other bean mixtures that are much lower in sodium.

This is great squash!  I only made one and didn't cut off the bottom, and I waited to put the beans in until about 10 minutes before it was done (baked) so they wouldn't get dried out.  Next time I'll leave out the little bit of margarine I put on top (couldn't really taste it) and I'll bake it longer so the squash is more tender.  This would be good with chicken or pork or something, but I just ate it on it's own.

The best acorn squash recipe ever.  Put it on the grill with a cover and let the skin char.  It's totally wonderful.

I received this as my 'Daily Dish' via email last week.  I thought it to be a very novel idea.  We are NOT squash eaters but I decided to try it anyway.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed it as did I.  Beings it was so cold out I decided to use the oven to get a little heat in the house.  Baked it at 350 for 1 hour as another reviewer suggested.

Put this in a dish that fit the squash, so didn't need to cut the bottom. Omitted the butter--not necessary and why put those fat calories in your body if you don't need to? Had too many baked beans to fit in the squash, so put them in a baking dish that I sprayed with non-stick spray. Baked at 350 for an hour (put the dish of beans in for about 30 minutes). This was a very tasty different way to serve squash. I served this with a chicken recipe that I also baked.

great presentation and delish!  the only prob is that it's not a lot of room for much baked beans.

I followed the directions pretty closely, but it was undercooked. I covered the squash the whole time, which might have been the problem. My fiance disliked it. He said that he had no idea how to eat it and ended up just eating the beans. I thought the flavors went well together and if I cooked it longer it would probably be a lot better.

This was really very good.  I don't think the butter/margarine was necessary ... I didn't taste it and it adds extra calories/fat, so I'll try it without next time, its a good way to get in vegetables, and I think I'll try someone elses suggestions of using non canned baked beans to reduce sodium content. Very good recipe though!

This dish was very easy to make, and fun to eat. The flavors went very well together. Just remember, this is very filling! No need to make anything to go with it, except maybe garlic bread. Thanks.

I don't like squash, but tried it for the rest of the family.  I now love squash this way.  The flavour of the beans and the squash together is fantastic. Next time I wouldn't put so much butter on the top of the beans.  We are trying not to eat so much fat.
