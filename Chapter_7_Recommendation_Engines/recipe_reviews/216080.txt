this is a wonderful recipe, I spreed mayo on my chicken and then rolled it in the cracker crumbs. Can add any mixture that you like in the filling. I change often to make it a little diferent all the time.

Thanks for a great keeper.  Hubby and I loved it. I omitted the cream cheese because I didn't think it needed it and it was wonderful without it.  Thanks again.

I thought this was a really great recipe, I doubled it for a dinner party last night and it was a hit.  I didnt roll the chicken bundles in the crackers, I just put them over the top of the chicken in the pan, and I put the leftover filling over the top too before adding the rest of the cheese to the top.

We loved it! We substituted the cheezits with saltine crackers and found this to be great -- a little less cheesy, so it wasn't overwhelming. My husband isn't a big fan of the canned mushrooms we have, but he loved them sauteed in butter and stuffed in the chicken.

Easy to make, and tasted great.  I ended up with more than 4 servings as indicated, but we have leftovers.  I used a favorite cheese cracker that did not crush easily, so I will be using Cheez-It crackers next time.

I have been a strict vegetarian for 17 years--since before I could be trusted at a stove, unsupervised!--so I have a limited idea of how to prepare meat (and how it should taste).  I recently started to try to cook dinner for my meat-eating boyfriend, and this was the 2nd meal I tried.  He loved it and ate two bundles immediately!  The only change I'll make is to add some seasonings next time -- he likes well-seasoned food.  Otherwise, it was a hit, and I felt so accomplished that I, a clueless veg-head, could cook chicken that someone enjoyed!

We did not like this. The salt/cheese content is overwhelming. My boyfriend didn't even finish his.... Which is not at all like him to leave any food on his plate. There isn't any freshness about it. I agree with the previous comment, it tastes like you are eating a huge chunk if salty cheese with a piece of chicken rolled in it. I do not recommend this.

Loved it! I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of mushrooms, since both myself and my husband hate them. We loved it! I only used two chicken breasts but made the full amount of filling, so we had lots. Delicious, and I can't wait to make it again.

I just gave this recipe a try last night, and I wasn't disappointed. Even my boyfriend had seconds, and he's terrified of my cooking! It's an easy recipe and provides a rich and hearty meal.

Growing up in Wisconsin, I learned to love and to know my cheese. This was really good, but between all the different cheeses (cream cheese esp.), it was a little heavy to eat. I normally just make recipes for something to do, and this one piece of chicken by itself was a full meal for all 190lbs of me. However, because it was so delicious and easy, it gets 5 stars. And I will certainly be making this again soon, probably with a little less cream cheese.

Thought it was great to begin with but made a few changes to suit our tastes.  I only used about half the amount of mushrooms but added 1 minced large clove of garlic and about 1/4 of a large onion also minced.  I also used the Italian Cheez-its instead of cheddar, parmesan/romano instead of just parmesan and 4 cheese Italian blend shredded cheese instead of chedder.  It tasted great and was a BIG hit with my wife.

This was incredible! I made a few changes the second time I made it. I used half a package of cream cheese--there are only two of us--and used onions and jalapenos instead of mushrooms. It was beyond delicious.  I also had to cook it about 45 minutes instead of thirty, but it was still so very juicy and tender.

Very bland.  Followed recipe exactly.  Tastes like you're eating a large chunk of cream cheese, with some sort of meat product wrapped around it.  If you like plain chicken breasts and cream cheese, you'll like this recipe...

Very good! I'll make this again with different fillings. Next time I'll use less cream cheese as it was a little much for my family's taste. I brined the chicken overnight and it was so tender, we could cut it  with a fork. Thanks!

Definitely different and something to serve for a special occasion. I added garlic to the cheese filling. Made 1/2 with mushrooms and 1/2 without (hubby does not like mushrooms). Did not have cheese flavored crackers so used Panko crumbs with grated parm mixed in. Very rich main coarse, but tasty.

I'm in the middle of eating this recipe and had to leave a review. My boyfriend LOVES it. I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese just to save on calories and it was still delicious. I used fresh mushrooms and threw in some red onion. Oh..my..goodness. Thank you so much! I'll be making this again!

We just made this and it was totally delicious! I'd say even better than a similar M&S chicken type meal. We used philadelphia whipped garlic and herb instead of plain cream cheese and didn't have any mushrooms so just left those out. Mmmmmm!
