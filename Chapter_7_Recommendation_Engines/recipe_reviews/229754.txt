A brief trip home to check on our kitchen remodel progress and we're back in Naples - and we were longing  for a home cooked meal.  So desperate for good home cooking that Hubs requested "Thanksgiving Dinner."  In July.  In Florida.  With limited opportunities to get in the kitchen and cook I was only too happy to oblige.  Realizing I had no bread for stuffing (and didn't want to use hot dog buns in the freezer...) I first had to make a loaf of bread.  And then I had to cut the bread up into cubes, and dry it in the oven for about a half hour at 225 degrees.  Now I admit I've never made stuffing with homemade bread before, and I must say I did notice the difference - and in a positive way.  Nor have I ever used a recipe for stuffing, but just for grins I had fun trying this very basic recipe and found that other than being a little on the salty side, it is a good, reliable recipe for stuffing that newbies or otherwise inexperienced cooks will appreciate.  I love the addition of fresh herbs in this and these aromatics not only flavored the stuffing nicely but filled the kitchen with their wonderful aroma (well, that and a turkey breast roasting in the oven at the same).  Take a good, basic stuffing recipe like this one, with its inclusion of fresh herbs, prepare it with a good bread (homemade or other) and you'll be quite pleased with the results.

My husband said this was the best stuffing he ever ate. I thought it was a bit dry, I was afraid to make it mushy, next time I will add more liquid and cook it less, I probably left it in the oven for longer because I baked it at the same time with turkey (350 instead of 375), but it WAS really good! I used 10 cups bread cubes(about 2cm-3/4inches big), 3 stacks celery, 2 medium onions, added 1-1 1/2 tsp thyme, I did not have poultry seasoning, so I added some rosemary, pinch of nutmeg, 1 tsp ground pepper, 1 1/2 cups chicken stock (I used cubes), poured over bread cubes, mixed, put into greased baking dish, and baked at 350F.

A good basic recipe for stuffing.  On the other hand, 1 cup of butter is excessive. I used about 3 tblsps. and that was adequate. It went well with roast chicken and a nice bottle of red wine. We enjoyed our dinner on New Year's Day.

This had good flavor, but was sort of mushy.  I'll try this recipe again but I'll use less broth.

I followed the recipe to the letter, but it was practically soup, and the butter taste was overpowering. I even had about 13 1/2 cups of bread cubes, because I wanted to finish the loaf. I will try again, but with 2-3 cups broth and maybe 1/4 butter.

Too Much butter!! It was very greasy. I had to keep draining the butter out of the casserole dish. Once I got most of the grease out, i baked it about another 40 minutes to get rid of the mushiness. The flavor was good, but next time i will omit about half of the butter.

I hate celery, so I omitted it.  It was still awesome.  I will make this again for sure.

Way, way too much chicken broth called for in the recipe. at the most 1 cup of chicken broth not 4 cups.  What a big mass of mush.  Complete disaster.

I cut the recipe in half as I was making this for only myself. It turned out great! Loved the recipe as it was so easy to make.

I followed the recipe to the "T" and turned out perfect.  I read one review where they said it turned out mushy, but I bet they didn't dry out the bread cubes first which is important so the bread soaks up all the flavors. I will make again.

This is an easy recipe for a very traditional tasting stuffing. Turned out great!
