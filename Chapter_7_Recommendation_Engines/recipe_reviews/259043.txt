This is the best recipe that I have made for a Cobbler.

First, I used the Quick oats and they blended-mixed well with the flour-butter mixture.  

Second, I would find a way to take off the peach skins or chop up the peaches in smaller pieces.   I used fresh Georgia peaches.

Third, I did not use any lemon juice or zest and the peaches had a strong enough peach taste for us.

Fourth, I did not use the glaze, which I think would make the dish even better, but the sweetness was enough for us as we are cutting back on sweets.

Fifth, the dough top was fluffy and cooked through as I used bread flour and added some baking powder as I did not have any All purpose flour on hand.

Yes, I will be baking this one again, might even add or change to some other fruit!

I baked it again today and it was FABULOUS!  Nice and crispy on top and not too sweet.  The only change was I used brown sugar instead of white in the dough and added a bit of extra oatmeal over the top of the dough.  

It was served warm, room temperature, after I rested it and then I put real Whipped Cream on top!  The best ever.

I followed the instructions word for word as I do the first time that I try a recipe and when it came out of the oven my wife couldn't keep her hands off of it! The next time that I make it I'll put a vanilla bean into the peaches and that should really take it over the top!

I made this for my 4th of July party and I added extra blueberries I had on hand. I did toss my fruit with a few tablespoons of sugar and one tablespoon of flour unlike Chef John, but I think it would've been great either way. The top was crispy as promised (thanks to the sugar trick) and the cobbler was gone in minutes.  I will be making this for many summers to come.

I baked this in a deep cast iron skillet on the BBQ because I didn't want to heat up the house. it was delicious! The only change I made from the recipe was I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have any.  It was still very good.

I made this word for word including the self rising flour not at the bottom of the recipe, even the tedious 3 long sessions of mixing. The amount of sugar on top was too much. The major reason I deducted stars was the batter did not fully cook. it was a runny, fizzy mess underneath the beautiful crisp top. Perhaps this recipe would be better in a 9x13 pan so the batter would be more spread out.

I had such high hopes for this recipe. I have forever been in search of a really good cobbler recipe. I thought this would be the one. Nope. Watched the video (which was entertaining) and followed the recipe word for word. When it came out of the oven, it looked just like it did in the video. The top was indeed nice and crisp.  I was so hopeful. When it was time to dig in, what a disappointment!  The inside was runny and soggy. Although promised by Chef John that I would not notice the peach skins, I did.  And, I did not enjoy chewing on them. It may be a matter of taste, but the lemon zest and juice overpowered the peaches and the crust was too sweet. My husband, who is not fussy, was not impressed. Guess I'm still in search of a good cobbler.

This was good, but I think it was too sweet.  I would probably use less sugar.

Wonderful!!
To much for two people, so I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8" cast iron pan on the grill.  Also, added 1/2 Tsp. cinnamon to batter and 1/2 cup blueberries to peaches.

I have made this twice and both times it turned out great. I made it with peaches the first time and nectarines the second time. I am amazed at how the oats are not perceivable visually but the flavour is enhanced so much. They should not be left out. The cooking time was perfect. My topping cooked perfectly and was not soggy or gooey. I have made a lot of cobblers but this is the one that will be my go-to from now on. Perfect sweetness and texture.

This was the BEST cobbler crust I have ever made. My dinner guests think Chef John is a genius! I just made the recipe - I didn't watch the video. It helped to have the time guidelines for creaming the butter and sugar, adding the flour and oats, and finally adding the milk - I would never have beaten them each long at each stage, and it really did the trick. I used fresh peaches and cut them up in dice-size pieces for small-child-size bites, and they did not overcook at all. I also liked sprinkling the sugar on top and misting it - I didn't even make the additional glaze for the top because it didn't need it. I can't wait to experiment with different fruit combinations that have this awesome top. I forgot to take a photo - next time for sure!

Loved the lemony peaches and love that no sugar was added to the filling. As per other  reviews - I followed the recipe to the exact & my cobbler topping was soggy & runny underneath the crispy topping. Any suggestions ? Maybe to much water sprayed on top? Oven temp?

I didn't have whole milk and used 1% instead, and it still was delicious! The cobbler was light and fluffy with an added crunch and the peaches cooked up beautifully with the skins and lemon juice. I didn't even need to add ice cream!

I love peach crisps but I wanted to try a cobbler but not miss out on the crispy aspect of the crisp. When I found this recipe, I was all in! This was good, I LOVE the flaky top! The only thing I would say is lower to the amount of sugar INSIDE the recipe to 3/4 cup and taste, and add some vanilla. After those minor changes, I definitely do recommend this recipe!

This was great!  We loved it.  I followed the recipe in its entirety.  (but I was a little skimpy on the sugar for the glaze!) Although I was a little apprehensive about the lemon zest and juice because my peaches seemed perfect as they were.  It was the wow factor compliment to even perfect peaches.  Thanks, Chef John! (No photo because we ate it as soon as it cooled off!)

I made this recipe exactly as directed. I really wasn't sure about the lemon or not peeling the peaches.  However, this was absolutely delicious. The entire family loved it. I made it in a cast iron skillet and that seemed perfect. This is a keeper! Thanks Chef John!

Really good. I peeled my peaches using a serrated peeler and I used the recipe for self rising flour from THIS site. Everything else was exactly the same. Thanks for a yummy treat!

This was wonderful with a few quick changes:  Adding 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon gave this a beautiful complex flavor.  (Don't skimp on the beating of the ingredients as directed, the texture of the batter depends on it!)
Also, after the 45 mins baking, it was still not even beginning to brown, so I set the oven to 400 degrees and baked for another 6 mins.  Absolutely beautiful and delightfully tender crunchy crust!  This is a winner!! :)

I doubled the recipe and forgot to add the other 2/3 cup of milk.  The topping turned out SUPER crispy and I just can't stop eating it.

It was delicious!  But mine should have baked longer than the recipe called for.  It was watery in the middle, but we microwaved it to finish an it was delicious!  The top was crispy and wonderful!

This turned out amazing, and I followed the recipe, with a couple minor changes. I omitted the lemon and used almond flavoring, as that was the flavor I grew up with when my grandmother made peach pie and crumble. Additionally, I had to bake it for another 10-12 minutes because the center was not fully cooked. Other than that, it was easy and delicious!

My hubby raved about this cobbler! He said it was the best thing he'd eaten in awhile and asked me to make it the next night. I didn't have self rising flour so added baking powder and a little salt. I didn't have a lemon on hand so used lemon juice and sprinkled lemon zest on top. I did add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the crust. I definitely will make this again! Soon!

This is the BEST Peach Cobbler I have ever made! I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out with no sweetener in the peaches and the lemon juice adding tang (or so I thought). It got rave reviews and I will add this to my favorites for Summer Peach Abundance!

After reading the reviews, I removed the peels from the peaches (boiled 3-4 minutes first to loosen).  Also used the recipe on Allrecipes for self-rising flour (flour, baking powder and salt) rather than buying it.  Turned out great.  Will be making it again this week for company!

The second time I made it I reduced sugar to 1 cup and increased oatmeal to 2/3 cup. That works fine and was very delicious.

Making this for the 3rd time. I find that the suggested cook time isn't long enough for my oven. If it's under-done the topping will be slimy underneath, even if the top is crisp. I might also try poking some vent holes in the top; maybe the sugar coat seals in the steam. Another note: be sure you do use baking POWDER when subbing for self-rising flour, because if you use baking soda the fruit skins will turn green. (Seriously.)

So delicious! I had fresh Ruston peaches and this was the perfect recipe! I followed it closely and mine looked exactly like Chef John's. Loved the touch of lemon, which absorbed into the crust, which by the way was awesone! Wish I had taken a photo to share.

We have our family at our house for dinner every Sunday, so I am frequently looking for something new or different.  I had picked up some good peaches at the grocery store and browsed for a dessert recipe. I am familiar with the biscuit topping on cobbler and was curious to try the crisp topping.  It was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it as well as the lemon flavoring.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I increased it by 50% to accommodate the number of people coming for dinner.  I baked it in a 9x13x2" Pyrex dish, which worked out perfectly.  

I had read some comments about not liking the peel on the peaches and also about the pain of peeling them.  That reminded me of a technique that I learned when canning - put the peaches  with skins still on in boiling water (enough to cover the entire peach/es) and boil for 2 minutes.  Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and let the peach sit for about a minute.  Then, using a paring knife, put the tip of the knife under the skin and pull the skin from the peach.  It just slides off!

I just added this recipe to our family cook book - it is a keeper!

It was okay. Followed the recipe except I didn't have rolled oats, only steel cut...made it a little chewy. Added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and used a deep dish to prevent spills, which extended the cooking time to an hour and 15 minutes.  Next time I make this recipe I will make the "crisp" topping (butter, brown sugar, and rolled oats) and sprinkle over the cake batter.

The only change I made was to include some blueberries that were in the refrigerator and needed to be used. The family enjoyed it, especially because the sugar was limited to the topping allowing the fresh taste and natural sweetness of the peaches to take top billing. The sugar glaze on top of the crust was an attractive and showy feature, too. I'll make it again, perhaps trying another fruit, although peaches are always a hit in my house.....

I followed the recipe "except" I added a little cinnamon to the peaches.  This recipe came out perfectly.  I like the sweetness and crispiness of the crust in contrast to the peaches slight tartness and lemony tang.  It's a good balance and not overly sweet.  I poured a little heavy cream over  instead of ice cream. Family thought it was different and delicious.  This ones a keeper in my recipe box.  Be sure to watch Chef John's video it really helps!

This was really good - followed the directions but used a mixer for the creaming. Used a mix of berries and lime extract instead of the lemon. Just sprinkled some water on top. Great cobbler taste with a crunch on top.

Top notch taste and super simple.  I added blueberries to the peaches and the simplicity of the lemon and zest worked just perfectly to spotlight the fruit in the height of its season.

I wanted to make a peach cobbler but didn't want the heavier crust.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It was delicious.  I didn't use the lemon.

This is Absolutely delicious !  I actually used 2 large cans of peaches in heavy syrup and boiled them in their juice with a half cup of sugar and some cinnamon and nutmeg to taste. I spooned them into the pan and followed the rest of the recipe as Chef John had it.  Wonderful !!   I’ve made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks so that should let you know just how much we loved it!

I followed the advice of others and did not glaze this with the extra sugar.  It was plenty sweet enough without it.  I did substitute 1/4 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also drizzled a little vanilla extract over the peaches, rather than the lemon.    It turned out perfect!   Good recipe, and will make again.

Loved it.. Added cinnamon and a drop of vanilla to the lemon juice, and let the peaches soak it in for a few minutes.

Also (as others mentioned, I left it in the over for 5 minutes after I turned the oven off to reduce liquid.

Thumbs up!

This recipe is super easy! My peaches were riper and really juicy so I had some trouble spreading the topping but that was the hardest part of the really easy recipe. I made  a double recipe since had lots of peaches exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious and crispy on top! I had some left over so I warmed it in the oven at 350 degrees the next day and  it was still amazing! I served it warm with some vanilla ice cream and it was a hit!Thank you Chef John! You did it again!

I made it! Halved it as it was for 2 of us. Made enough for 4 servings. Used 4 peaches. Followed all instructions to a tee. Set timer on oven for 45 minutes and that was a mistake. I should have checked it around 35 minutes and removed at 40minutes. I bit too well done on top, not burned but almost. My fault because all new recipes need to be tested in our own ovens before blindly following anothers advice. Lesson learned. I will be making this again. The lemon zest and juice I think made this such a refreshing dessert. I was concerned about it being bland and wanted to add cinnamon and or nutmeg but resisted. lol Glad I did because it was perfect flavor on its own.

I thought this recipe was delicious. The only problem was I followed Chef John's advice and didn't peel the peaches. Bad idea. The peels separated from the peaches and just slid around in between the peaches, so I do not agree that it doesn't change the texture. It definitely does! I will say that the crust is fantastic. So crispy and flavorful! I added a bit of sugar and corn starch to the peaches, but followed crust directions exactly. Just don't make the same mistake I did and warm the cobbler up the next day with foil on top. It ruined the crispness. Lesson learned! I will definitely make this again!!

I have made this two times and each time it was absolutely delicious!!  The only problem I have had is that the peaches can get a little "soupy", not sure how to address this.  The lemon zest is part of what makes this so special, but maybe I will not squeeze all of the lemon juice over the peaches. Leaving the skins on makes the dish very pretty and they really virtually disappear when cooked.
This is a real winner.  Love Chef John!  His video also taught me how to separate peach halves for cleaner cutting.

I used nectarines instead of peaches, I did everything the same. It turned out great but the addition of the lemon and the fruit itself not that sweet, next time I will add brown sugar to the fruit.

I made this and used the helpful hint on how to make self rising flour.  I baked it for 45 minutes at 375F as per the instructions.   I had to put the cobbler back in the oven a second time because the centre of the batter wasn't cooked.  Edges were fluffy and fully cooked but the centre was wet .  Back in fir and additional 15 minutes at 375F.
It was easy to make and smells delicious.

yum, yum-yum, yum , yum!  
I used less sugar (about 3/4 what was called for), but otherwise followed recipe.  Cooked in a cast iron small skillet .  I also didn't notice the peach skins and loved the texture and result.  I usually assume it will be great if it is a Chef John recipe and I do recommend watching the video for the best result.

Delicious! The only thing I did different was use brown sugar on top, so crunchy and good. Oh and I also drained the peaches a bit, they were almost over ripe and very juicy. Thank you!!

Followed recipe except for used one percent milk instead of whole milk.  A  good cobbler except the center was mushy and not set. Even cooked another 12 minutes. We  ate the edges which where delicious. Will use the topping for other cobblers and maybe use a 9 x13 pan or skip the glaze. The glaze tasted and looked wonderful. But another mentioned that the shell topping may have caused a steam bath by not venting the heat- causing the cobbler to stay liquid. The taste and texture of cobbler dough is too good for me not to use again.  As for the filling; did not like the skin on peaches ( just a personal preference).

Loved this peach cobbler recipe.  I used the juice of only 1/2 a lemon (because it was too lemony the 1st time I made it) and baked it for 10 extra minutes so it would cook in the middle. Served warm with vanilla ice cream.

This is the most delicious recipe!  I did sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top of the peaches, but other than that, I made it exactly as Chef John instructed.  I used Sun Crest peaches fresh from the tree.  Sweet and juicy....nothing better!

My mouth is watering as I write about this fantastic dessert.  I confess that I used my mixer to blend the sugar and butter, then the rest of the topping ingredients.  I only used 1/2 c. sugar on the top, but wet it down thoroughly as suggested. I baked it in my cast iron skillet for the suggested time, then turned off the oven and let it bake for ten more minutes as suggested on another review.   It was crusty, juicy and delicious.

Really good and really easy!  I made it exactly like the recipe but left out the lemon and zest because I didn't have one on hand.  It still turned out great but I did have to cook it much longer than 45 minutes -- mine took an hour and 20 minutes for the center to get browned and cooked.  It did not overbake and was still really tasty.  Will be making this again.

So good and easy I will always make it this way. Use a small lemon. It was a little too lemony the first time when I used a large lemon. You can leave out the zest too.

This is a great recipe!   I did swap out something and add a few things. :3    For the topping glaze I used brown sugar instead of white.  And I added a sprinkling of Cinnamon and Nutmeg to the peaches.   OMG it was SOOOO good :3 .  took it to a picnic, and it went so fast :3

Turned out great. Used 10 peeled peaches and 1/3 cup each brown and white sugar since the peaches were very sweet.  Added some flour to the fruit as well. Will make this again, with other fruits.

First time making a peach cobbler and it tasted wonderful and turned out great.  I had an audience of 5 high school girls and boys, which three said they didn’t like peaches nor ever tried peaches cooked.  All of them loved it and went back for seconds.  We served it warm, 30 minutes out of the oven with French vanilla ice cream.  Such a treat in summer in Michigan!!! My peaches were freshly picked from Georgia Peach Truck which delivers them directly to towns fresh off trees within a day or two.  Yummy, usually it’s late July August before I can get a decently tasting ripened peach at the grocer.  A must try!

This was excellent and loved by all. My only recommendation would be to reduce the lemon zest a bit. The crust s fun and different  from the usual. I used a bit less sugar for the crust and it was fine.

This recipe is amazing! Completely satisfied me to the max! I only put a cup of sugar for the batter. I added vanilla bean paste and ground cinnamon to the batter mix. I also added more oats to the batter. The filling I left alone. Love love love the lemon. The lemon+zest is a must! Will be making it again ASAP especially since it’s peach season

This was good...I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have any...I didn't use enough peaches for the amount of batter, but I loved the crispy taste...it's a keeper...next time I will try with apples...

A good recipe; too much lemon for my taste. Next time, I'll grate a bit of ginger in with the peaches.

I was looking for a recipe to use oranges as I have a lots on hand. I used this recipe, using 6 large navel oranges. I used about 1/4 less sugar in the recipe and about i/8 cup less for the topping and it was plenty sweet. Used orange zest and lime juice as that was what I had on hand. Next time I will add some more liquid but definitely going to making this recipe using oranges again and will use with fresh peaches this summer.

Okay, so I don't ever rate things...but honestly  — this tasted so AMAZING! I used fresh smaller peaches (so I increased to about 12 peaches), skin on, and I really think it was the lemon that made this taste out of this world. I did not think it would taste great (just peaches and lemon???) but I was so wrong. I did sprinkle the peaches with about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon sugar, but it was that lemon that did the magic!! The fact that the peach mixture was tart and the batter was sweet was a factor in the great taste. There was a little liquidy "juice" in the bottom with the peaches, but it was a nice  spooned over the crisp oat breading — so delightful. I just can't get over how my mouth lit up with that first bite (seriously!) It was a great hit at our Easter dinner!

It came out great! I made it exactly as the recipe was written, but I had it cook an extra 10 minutes because the crust/batter didn't look done at the recommended time. It was perfect after the longer cook time! I would select better peaches next time, mine were not as sweet, but it worked out fine since the batter and crust were sweet. I will make this again!

i had picked a ton of yellow peaches with the grandbaby this summer. we spent a lovely afternoon in glastonbury, ct! i needed a recipe that would be fairly easy. this one did not require peach peeling!!!! YAY!

best:
*no peeling required
*can sub gluten free 1 to 1 type flour (i used Bob's Red Mill)
*no sugar needed for the peach filling

worst:
*mixing , mixing, sweating, mixing
*misting (but at least it reminded me to water my plants)
*i did not have a fancy pan

I was really skeptical about leaving the skin on the peaches but truly, i think it enhanced the cobbler.  mixing the butter and sugar was a chore and the (gluten free) oats made me wonder how this would work in the batter. otherwise, it was a cinch AND not having to worry about a bottom "crust" at all and yet get a peach pie kinda dessert was wonderful.

i was able to substitute Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 flour (the one with the xanthan gum) with no issues and i also used Bob's GF oats. 

this cobbler was not too sweet and the fresh peaches did not need any flavor enhancing beyond the lemon zest anyway.  i used the sugar called for on top of the crust and it was perfect.

sadly, i had a plain old square glass baking dish that worked just fine but looked ugly. i had no drips but i put a pan underneath just in case. my goal now is to find fancier baking ware and casserole dishes. 

a wonderfully easy, slightly time consuming peach crisp recipe. i plan to make this again a few times NEXT summer when peaches are back in sea

Followed receipe and cooked at suggested temperature and time.  Came out with lovely crispy topping and so pleased.  Waited the 30 minutes before taking first scoop but quickly discovered the gooey uncooked batter under the topping.  If I try this again will use a 9x13 size.

Have tried many cobbler recipes and this was the best of them all. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and a small amount of almond extract to the crust mixture for a little zing.

Absolutely will make it again, very delicious and loved the extra crunch. We ate it without the ice cream and didn't even miss the ice cream. Reminded me of my moms apricot crunch that she made when we were kids. I will definitely have to get some apricots and try it with this recipe.

9/2018. Labor Day dinner.   Outstanding flavor.   Misted with only a small mist and used a little less sugar in both batter and crust.  The batter came out a little too moist .  Maybe bake 5 minutes longer?

This was excellent. It is really true that you do not notice the peach peels when it is done. I *really* appreciate not having to take that step for making this dish! The crust was beautiful and crunchy.  Unfortunately, it does not stay crunchy when it is covered for storage.  A super easy, delicious dessert I am sure to make again and again!

I'll be moving on to a different recipe. It was much too doughy. Too much dough for the amount of peaches. If I try it again, I will double the amount of peaches and bake a little longer.

Awesome! Nice crisp top. Exactly what I was looking for. I added cinnamon to the top with the sugar. My family went nuts and ate it all. Make a double batch.

Love this recipe. Easy to make if you have ripe peaches. Don’t try with rock hard ones. I sprinkled cinnamon on the peaches because my husband loves it. The crust is crazy good and makes a good combo with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

It was good but I added more cinnamon the second time I made it . I think spreading the cobbler rather than dollop is best .  Overall a very good recipe!

This turned out so delicious! I got rave reviews from all who tried it. Used half as much sugar on top than listed and added a bit of sugar to my peaches only because they weren't all the way ripe yet. Turned out wonderfully crisp on the outside and the peaches were juicy and sweet! As other reviewers mentioned, the underside of the crisp topping was a bit mushy, but no one seemed to mind. When I try it again, I might leave it in the oven for a bit longer.

I DO NOT BAKE. However, this recipe was so easy to make that I didn't ruin it! Gave some to my friend and he loved it! Don't be afraid of this recipe. I will scale back a 1/4 cup of the sugar next time for batter because it was too sweet.

This is a wonderful cobbler!  I made it exactly like the recipe.  I watched Chef John’s video several times and did it just like the video.  It turned out to be the best peach cobbler I have ever made.  We did peel the peaches because as my friend stated, they were drought peaches from her tree (we have had almost no rain this spring/summer) and the skins were tough.  It turned out just like the picture and it was delicious.  I will be making this one again and again!  Thank you Chef John for an awesome dessert!

Works exactly as described.  Crispy and delicious.  I used 1 cup of sugar in the topping mix and will use less next time.  I used whole wheat flour and old fashioned oats.  For the sugar topping I used a sugar/vanilla bean blend.  This was delightful!

I followed this to a tee! Around here in Missouri- we have “Calhoun peaches” and a neighbor brought me a bag from the local farmers market. Thanks Kammy! This was amazing and I love the “fork doesn’t lie” test on the crust.

Very tasty & quite easy. Only added 1 cup of sugar and that was enough for the peaches (which were  a bit over-ripe). It also worked to sprinkle water on the top by hand.

Made this for my husband's Birthday & he LOVED it, actually the whole family enjoyed.  The following changes were made: due to time I had to use frozen peaches but it was still awesome, next time I will try fresh, but this was a huge time saver and still tasted great.  I did toss the peaches w/ a little sugar and instead of using lemon, I tossed w/ 1 1/2 TBS of vanilla.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as Chef John wrote it and it truly was perfect.

My grandson wanted peach cobbler for his 14th birthday dessert so I went on allrecipes and found Chef John's wonderful Crisp Peach Cobbler.  I tripled the recipe and made one recipe GF.  The only change I made was add cinnamon to the peaches and omitted the lemon juice and zest because I didn't have lemons.  Everyone loved it!  This is now the only peach cobbler I'll ever make...so good!

Liked it very much, very easy, but will probably add a bit of cinnamon to the batter next time.  Also tried to spread the water on topping using a pastry brush, not so good, my topping was not very crispy.  Will maybe purchase a spray bottle before I try again.

I liked it! I did tweak it a little. I mixed brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon together. I sprinkled the peaches with it before proceeding with the recipe. I sprinkled the batter with it before I baked it as well.

I made this with tart cherries (took 5 cups cherries and added 2T flour, 1 cup sugar and 1t almond extract in place of peaches for filling). I like the short bread type crust better then a more cake like one.
