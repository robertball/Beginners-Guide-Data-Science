I give it 4 stars cuz it needs tweaking to be great...here's what you need to do:
after seeding the peppers you must blanche them in salted boiling water for 2 minutes
to the cream cheese mixture you need to add a few dashes of tobasco, a sprinling of chili powder and cayenne, some cilantro chopped very very finely, and a few real bacon bits.
let the mixture sit for a while before stuffing, the flavours need to mingle
you need to use seasoned breadcrumbs, but be sure to dredge them in FLOUR first, or else not enough egg will stick to the peppers, and in turn, not enough breadcrumbs will stick to them either...and do a double coating for extra crispiness! (and less oven leakage of cheese).
with these adjustments it is a winning recipe.
also, put the stuffed prepared peppers into the fridge for an hour before breading, this also cuts down on leakage because they are firmer.
some folks say they arent spicy enoug: this depends on your peppers. some jalapenos are hotten than others, just liek some aples are sweeter than others. if you notice you have a bland batch of ppers when you are sedding them (and belive me, you'll KNOW if you have a spicy batch from the coughing you'll do) save soem of the seeds, or add even more tobasco.

Very easy and tasty recipe. My husband and I had an assembly line making these little lovelies.  As others suggested, we used colby/jack cheese instead of cheddar.  Put the cheese mixture in a ziploc baggie and cut the corner.  This way, you can pipe the mix in to the jalapeno with no mess! We also dredged them in flour before rolling in the egg.  We also used the bread crumb mix instead of corn flakes. We ended up freezing them on the cookie sheet after they were cooled, then placed in a freezer bag for future use!

These are great!  I added some mozzarella to the mix and dredged the peppers in flour mixed with cayenne, paprika, thyme, and garlic powder before re-dipping them in the egg, and then Italian breadcrumbs (which I used in lieu of the corn flakes).  I baked them in a muffin tin, 3 to a cup, and that helped hold them together and keep the cheese in.  Halfway through baking I sprayed them with Pam which helped to brown.  They were very comparable to the deep fried version and I had to keep myself from eating the whole batch!  They are VERY messy and TIME CONSUMING to make, however, so they will not be a regular, but as a special treat they are nice...

I explored the internet and included many recipes from "allrecipes" for the best tasting jalapeno popper. I chose this recipe based on the baking method, rather then fried. I followed this recipe to the "T" and found it easy to pipe in the filling, (using the ol' corner of baggie method) and gently rolling the peppers in milk/egg, then cornflake crumbs. Not hard at all, milk, egg mixture really stuck to pepper, and cornflake crumbs a perfect combination. 
Was delicious! Family ate all, (and had quite few from garden). I really like the baked part, honestly didn't miss the "fried" mess that usually comes with frying. Really worth a very small effort!

Everyone at my party loved these!  My only suggestion is that you dip the peppers in a little flour before dipping in the egg because the cornflakes didn't stick to the peppers.

I used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes.  Put them in the freezer before baking to try and get the cheese to stay put. Definitely would recommend cooking the jalapenos before stuffing them.

These were really good.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I breaded them with italian bread crumbs, dunked in the egg mix again and then breaded once more.  The crust stayed on beautifully!  An idea too, I left the stems on as best I could so I had something to hold on to while dipping and breading.  Definitely a lot healthier than the fried version.  This is a regular at my house now.

For as skeptical as I was about these, they disappeared so quick.  I did a trial run the night before making these, and I wasn't to thrilled with the way that they baked, the filling kinda ran out all over the baking sheet.  Sooo, I decided to chop off the stems of the peppers & slit them lengthwise (without cutting them in half).  I scraped the seeds out, and then stuffed them with the mixture (which I suggest cutting in 1/2 or doubling the peppers because I have 1/2 of it left).  I ran out of time so I skipped the breading part & microwave "steamed" them, I have to say, they looked much better than the oven trial, and they were gone quick, I didn't even get to try one!  Thanks Paula!

Excellent!  Could have used more peppers as there was an abundance of mix for the inside.  They went fast when I brought them to a party.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love poppers,  I buy them in bulk all the time, but never made them like this before.  I added habanero and ghost chile in the cheese cause I'm crazy like that.  Another good way to make poppers is to just cut the stem off and leave the whole pepper intact and remove the seeds (a potato peeler works well to do this), then fill with just creme cheese and wrap pepper with bacon and bake or grill.  You can get a stand that holds I think like 25-50 peppers at any Cabelas store, or online.  This way the cheese stays in the pepper.

Instead of using corn flakes..I use potato flakes(instant mashed potatoes).Most companies that produce jalapeno poppers use this for the outside crust..try it

Thank you Paula. Unlike the comment from the "recipe Negative Nancy" this recipe is great! I appreciate the baking instead of frying. As she stated her her own post, this does NOT have the ingredients that Emeril's recipe has, so I ask, how can it be his? I don't think your efforts deserved the 1 star rating she gave. I love this recipe!

I followed the advice of others and blanched the jalapenos (salted boiling water for approximately 1 min and ice water approx 2 mins). This definitely helped out a lot. I also dredged them in flour before rolling them in bread crumbs (which I used instead of corn flakes), which also made a huge difference.

As far as the taste goes, you really have to kind of play around with the recipe to suit the heat level you want. We love super spicy, so I added cayenne and chili powder to the cream cheese mixture. Also, next time depending on how many I'm making, I may cut the cream cheese ingredients in half. I had a ton left over from just making the 30 poppers.

These are a little bit of work but well worth it!

I'm giving this 5 stars, but please consider:  Go to the deli, for each 12-15 peppers, buy 1/4 lb. thinly sliced ham.  Cut the ham into little squares, and put some in the bottom of each 1/2 pepper.  Plain cream cheese, or the cheddar/cream cheese mix on top - you don't need the mayo.  Bake about 30 minutes in preheated oven, no coating or other nonsense.  Sprinkle liberally with celery salt.  Cool about 5 minutes before serving.

These were great!  The whole family loved them.  There was so much filling left over that we ended up doubling the amount of peppers though.  I added a bit of chili pepper, paprika, and garlic salt to the cheese mix, just to spice it up a bit, and that worked really well.  Before dipping the peppers in egg I dipped them in flour with a bit of those same spices, plus salt and pepper.  Crush the cornflakes finely, and beware, they get gummy after ten or so peppers, and you'll need a fresh bowl... but we tried both bread crumbs and cornflakes, and all agreed the cornflakes were *much* tastier.  The crunch is great!  Finally, we warmed and thinned a little raspberry spread to dip them in, and it was the *perfect* touch... sweet and spicy, these babies were well worth the work.

My husband loved these! I didn't have cream cheese but I did have Ricotta cheese so I used this instead and I didn't have corn flakes but I had Italian bread crumbs so I used that instead this was a real hit!

My mum gave me this recipe and I have been making it for years always with rave reviews. I use the hard style cream cheese and no mayo and usually have minimal leaking. I also usually add a bit of oregano and a can of diced green chilies to the cheese mixture. When I cut each jalepeno in half I take care to cut down the middle of the stem so each has a little handle and I leave a couple of seeds in if I'm feeling kinda spicy. I usually use breadcrumbs, but I like the cornflake or panko idea and might give that a try next time. Great recipe!

Very tasty, especially when tweaked as ROSANACANADA suggested.  If you want HOT peppers, look for fine brown/gray lines on the skin of the pepper.  If you want milder ones, look for smooth shiny skins.

Good - tips: After you cut the jalapenos boil for 1 min and then put in cold water for a minute. I used bread crumbs, seasoned them w/ pepper, onion powder and parmesan cheese. I didn't use milk, just egg. Baked for 30 min and broiled for a minute. Turned out great!

These were definitely good.  I read the reviews prior to making them and I took some of the advice.  I made the cheese filling mixture the evening prior to making the peppers - it turned out delicious.  I did add a little bit of garlic salt because some of the reviews said that the filling was too mild.  I did blanch the cut/seeded peppers for about 2 min prior to working with them.  I would suggest drying the peppers off or letting them air dry for awhile before stuffing and coating them because the batter did not stick as well to the wet peppers.  I also found that it worked well coating the stuffed peppers in flour prior to coating them as well.  I actually tried several coatings when I made these.  If you want your poppers to look pretty, I suggest italian bread crumbs.  Work in small batches because the bread crumbs tend to get goopy.  They tasted very good too - one coat is just fine.  I also tried a 1/2 and1/2 mixture of bread crumbs and tortilla chip crumbs.  These were pretty good, too.  My favorite was a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of finely crushed tortilla chips and cool ranch doritos.  Mmmm - these were oh-so-crispy and tasty.  I used 18 peppers and I did have a little bit of filling left.  Some of the cheese did melt out of the filling but it was not a big problem.  I recommend filling the poppers a little over the edge - more filling tastes better.  I hope this helps!

I am sure they are healthier baked but I fried them anyway as requested by the kid.The filling was a hit with the kids. I double dipped in bread crumbs lacking corn flakes/that came out well. The only complaint  was the peppers were too crunchy/wanted the peppers to be softer. Another posted had the same comment and boiled the pepper for 2 min first. That would get the pepper softer but I am afraid the pepper will lose it's flavor that way. I think next time I will try freezing the peppers after cleaning the seeds out....that might break down the texture a bit without losing flavor. Edited to add: next time I made these I did blanche the peppers. They came out less meaty (happier kids) and they did not lose any flavor.

My son and I really enjoyed these poppers.  I substitued sour cream for the mayo and added chopped bacon to the mixture.  Also added a little garlic.  The cheddar cheese flavor was wonderful.  The crushed corn flake coating is the way to go rather than bread crumbs.  I really liked that they were baked rather than fried.  Thanks!

AMAZING! I added fresh cilantro and 1/4 cup sour cream to the cheese/mayo/cream cheese mixture. Then piped it into the halfed jalapenos using a ziplock bag (cutting one corner off). Also the process went fast b/c I had a helper. She cut and seeded the jalapenos while I piped in the mixture. Then she rolled in flour/egg and I coated them with corn flakes. Absoutley amazing, I got rave reviews! I cannot wait to make again.

I had an overabundance of jalapeno peppers this summer and didn't know what to do with them.  Someone suggested to try these and I made them up and froze them (before breading).  Then when I a party to go to, I made them up.  They were a hit.  I had only made 1/2 of what I had froze.  I should have made them all!  Delish!!!

ADD BACON!  These work fine as written but my family likes bacon bits in their poppers so I added half the small bag of "Real" bacon bits.  They were great!  On the second recipe, I left the mayo out and it was just as good to me!  4 stars with no bacon but 5 stars with the bacon bits added!

Great Appetizer!  Preparation wasn't as complicated as I had expected.  I agree with other reviewers that more jalepenos could be used, I had filler left over too.  They turned out perfectly and were the first things to disappear off of the table!  I served them with sweet red pepper jelly.  Delicious!!  Will definitely be making these again! Thank you for the recipe!! :o)

Bland.  Suggest substituting cheese mixture with blue cheese and use Italian bread crumbs to give it a little more flavor

I must have done something wrong... They were ok, but I do not feel the same "affection" toward them as these other reviewers. They took me close to an hour to put together, and I really didn't feel it was worth it.  My husband said they were good, not great. I liked the theory of the recipe, it just didn't fit our taste... Thanks for the recipe,it gives me a few good ideas!!

Easy to make.  My grown kids gobbled them up.  FYI: approx 15 peppers equals one pound.  I've made these twice now...watch out for getting pepper juice on your hands and then wiping your face.  Even washing my hands seemed to leave pepper residue on my fingers....ouch! :)

Panko bread crumbs!  Wow, this was great.  I followed the directions except that I added some Weber "Kickin' Chicken" seasoning to the cheese.  Also, because I have the patience of a lightning bolt, I just couldn't do the rolling around in the eggs and stuff.  I used a tablespoon and spooned the egg/milk mixture over the top of the peppers after they were stuffed, one at a time, and then spooned panko bread crumbs over them, nice, quick and easy.  Man, they were the bomb!  Thanks!

I just used low fat cream cheese and a small slice of pepper jack cheese on top...much easier and healthier.

I read all the reviews about these, and since the jalapenos I had were very meaty, I opted to blanch them for 2 min like some readers had suggested. Omitted the mayo, using just cheddar and cream cheese, and used panko crumbs for extra crunch. They were awesome-I wouldn't change anything further. I assembled them one day, dipped battered and baked a couple days later. Next time I will make a bigger quantity to have some to freeze for later. Also served them with a sourcream/salsa dip.

Yummy! I did not bother with the egg and milk, and the crumbs stuck just fine. I had to use crushed butter crackers because I did not have corn flakes.

This was perfect! I'd been craving jalapeno poppers, and this recipe worked out just as I'd hoped. I did replace the cornflakes with breadcrumbs, but other than that, I did it as directed. And they were wonderful.

I just made these last night as a "try-out" for a Cinco De Mayo Party this weekend.  I'm glad I did.  First, these are good, however, not "showy" material. Not sure if they're good enough to bring to a potluck.  We tried all different ways using a variety of the reviews found here.  If I do bring them here are the changes I will make.  I will add a bit of chili powder to the filling - which was very tasty.  The crushed cornflakes are WAY BETTER then the bread crumbs (as was suggested by others) and we added chili pepper flakes to the coating.  I read a review to blanch the peppers first, which we didn't do but I will next time because they were not nearly soft enough.  We found the the amount of Jalapeno Pepper to filling was not in proportion so I would ream the pepper out a bit more before I stuff them too.  I will also change the cooking time.  The coating was done and the cheese started oozing out at the 10 minute mark.  It was a good start to a potentially great appetizer.

These are wonderful! I made a few changes: I cut off the tips and scraped the insides clean with a apple peeler. I stuffed with cream cheese, garlic salt, and cheddar cheese using the ziplock bag method. Then dredged in flower, dipped in egg, rolled in italian bread crumbs. I repeated for extra crunch. I put them upright in a muffin tin and baked. Be sure to not overcook! They have a wonderful aroma when baking!

Wonderful! I used breadcrumbs (didn't have cornflakes) and fresh garden picked peppers.  Most of the 'heat' comes from the seeds and ribs.  Scrape the ribs out for milder tasting poppers, leave them intact for a hotter taste.

Pros: 
-Tastes really good!
-Pretty simple recipe

Cons:
-my fingers are burning from the jalapenos even the day after. Use gloves.
-It's messy- seeds everywhere, the cheese WILL come out of the popper, use foil.
-It's really time consuming including seeding.

4 recommendations
-I used crushed tortilla chips for breadcrumbs, I don't think I would have liked them if I used breadcrumbs, it gives them a nice crunch
-Add seasoning to the spread like cayenne pepper, garlic/onion powder- it's basically what's in taco mix minus the msg
-Don't use as much cheese and cream cheese, I used 3/4 the amount and I still had leftover spread plus I knew I stuffed them enough cause they bubbled over when baking.

These poppers were fantastic!  Can be made ahead of time up to the "breading" with the corn flakes.  Yum yum!  WARNING:  Wear gloves when handling the peppers to protect your hands.

Ditto no flavor... Needs more seasoning, more cheddar cheese, and pickled jalapenos would probably be better. These were not good.

I substituted bread crumbs that I'd run through a food processor for the cornflakes.  They were absolutely delicious!  I especially liked not having to deep fry them.  Easier cleanup (I used aluminum foil on the cookie sheet) and healthier!

OMG! Sooooo good!!
I made a couple as per the directions (and left a couple seeds in to spice it up) and they turned up best. I double coated some which worked out really well. 
I added bacon (everything is better with bacon) but it didn't have the right kick. Maybe is was the bread crumbs I put in when I was running out of Corn Flakes. I don't recommend bread crumbs. Too bland. The Corn Flakes give it a nice crunch.
It is a delicious recipe!

I used not just sharp cheddar, but also some Jarlsberg and mozzarella. I also used breadcrumbs. I took the mayo, cream cheese, and all my cheeses (chopped into small bits) and tossed into my magic bullet to create a uniform texture filling that I just piped into the middle. I also double layer bread crumbed them, because one layer was barely enough (I also floured them so the egg would stick).

I added chopped bacon to the stop and used italian bread crumbs (because I already had them...) brought these to thanksgiving this year and everybody loved them!  Only problem was not enough filling for using larder jalapenos, make extra!

Personally, I do not like hot peppers, but my husband does.  So I made these for him.  But the peppers that I bought were even too hot for him.  So we sent these over to a few neighbors, who I know love "hot", and they called to tell me to keep the recipe close by and send peppers over whenever I want.  So they must be good.

Love these!  A little labor intensive when you're making them for 50 people, so by the end, we ended up chopping up the remaining peppers and mixed them with the remaining cheese mixture, putting it in a casserole dish and baking it after sprinkling it with breadcrumbs: turned out delicious!  I think we might be making the Jalapeno Popper dip from now on!

Oh, so good!  I made a few with creamy goat cheese as well and they had such a smooth flavor.  Highly recommended!

awesome!  made one minor change... substituted ground pork rinds for corn flakes for a NO CARB recipe.  did follow other tips such as blanching in boiling water for 2 minutes and added tabasco sauce to cheese mixture.

Fantastic when freshly baked!  Two things: I used breadcrumbs (but I'm sure it's even better with cornflakes), and I didn't coat the whole thing in egg+breadcrumbs.  Instead, I just brushed the egg on the top and sprinkled breadcrumbs.  I'm going to upload a photo of the end product, so you can see how (beautifully) they turned out.

These were a little tricky to make the first time, but they tasted almost as good as the ones you get at restaurants--without all the fat from frying!

Excellent way to make poppers without frying in heavy grease.  You couldn't even tell they were made with corn flakes!  Not kid friendly as they are a bit hot but adults love them.  I served with a ranch dip and I can't wait to make them for our New Year's Eve party!

these were so easy to make, and were devoured as soon as they came to the table.  I would add a couple of seeds for more spice, and dip in flour before the egg mixture for more coating.  I made them the day before, they were a huge Hit.

Don't forget to wear gloves when working with these peppers.  Not the prettiest looking poppers I've had, but they were good right out of the oven and right out of the fridge the next day.

These were very good I have made them with both corn flakes and bread crumbs.  For an extra kick leave a few seeds in the pepper before you add the cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

MMM... so good! I did make a few changes, but not enough to rate the dish lower overall: I used reduced fat cream cheese and 2% sharp cheddar, Panko bread crumbs (only b/c I had no corn flakes);also fat free greek yogurt instead of mayo (personal preference). I sprayed the tops of each one w/ nonstick cooking spray. As a plus, my changes actually made the dish quite a bit lower in fat & calories... YAY!
Also, my jalapenos were on the smaller side but I was able to stuff 30 of them with the filling as stated.

These were amazing, I made 3 pounds of them for a party and they went soo fast. However, I made these at 10am and by bedtime at 11pm my hands were still on fire. I slept with my hands in ice bags. Please get yourself a pair of gloves for the entire process, dont be a dumby like me.

Cut mayo to 1 tbsp, used white sharp cheddar.  I fried mine, baking is such a crime.  Double dipped in egg, flour, egg then flour then egg then panko bread crumbs.  Deepfried at 325 til a tad over golden (almost as dark as a beer bottle).  DIVINE!  Used oriental sweet chili sauce, excellent compliment!

I love this recipe except I use Cubanelle (mild italian) peppers.  They are bigger than a jalapeno so you need more of the filling.  I also add a few minced garlic cloves to the mixture.  DELICIOUS!!!

great no fry recipe, I did not have sharp cheddar, so I used a shredded taco cheese mix w/ cream cheese. Had fresh peppers from the garden and this recipe became a favorite for my husband and neighbors.

WOW!  I was kind of surprised how close these were to the ones served as appetizers in resturaunts.  I used dried breadcrumbs instead, as I prefer the smoother texture of the coating.  The inside was smooth, creamy and a great flavor match to the spice of the Japenleno.  This batch was a trial run and will be made again tomorrow for Super Bowl. YUM!!!

Best thing ever!!! My boyfriend begs me to make them. They are spicy with a great crunch from the corn flakes. And baking makes them healthier than frying. Absolutely Awesome!!  But ps- wear gloves when working with the jalapenos. The first time I made them my hands were on fire!!!

These were a hit! The recipe could easily do 30-35 poppers.

I used 2 tablespoons of sour cream instead of the mayo, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/8 - 1/4 of a cup of Monterey Jack cheese, shredded or cut up fine, and a few dashes of paprika.

I also blanched the peppers for 2 minutes. Be warned - Do not breathe in the steam from the boiling water when you empty the pot! I knew these peppers were very hot when I did that so I toned down the filling. I coated once in flour and twice in egg, breadcrumbs. I also left the stems on and this added for easier handling and looked nice too :-)

I did fry mine only because my daughter had made mozzarella cheese sticks (yummy!) and the oil was hot. Took about 1 1/2 minutes at 375F or 190C fryer temp.

As for the extra filling I had left over, I heated up and used it as a dipping sauce :-)

These were very bland and just so hard to make. I will not make these again. I made them for a party and nobody ate them. The plastic wrap stayed on them the entire time...not even one was eaten. I guess they didn't look very good either. It was hard to keep the crushed corn flakes on them..it was just a big mess.

Followed the recipe exactly - even after reading reviews - turned out pretty decent.  Filling isn't super creamy - I would cut back on the shredded cheese and maybe add a little sour cream.  I made a berry sauce to dip them in which they much needed.  Did have to dip in flour before egg to make flakes stick.  Some onion and/or garlic in filling would probably help as well.  Overall good though, will make again.

This is a hit every time I make it and people can't believe it's homemade! I use reduced fat mayo, cream cheese, and cheddar/monterey jack cheeses. I also use corn flake bread crumbs instead of cereal, I find that it sticks better. Also it's wise to use latex gloves when handling the peppers.

Excellent recipe.  I used light cream cheese and cheddar, so it didn't melt all over the place.  I also used some healthy bran cereal which was a bit sweet which was just perfect.  It's a lot of work, but worth it.  We couldn't stop eating them.

These were great!  My friends gave the recipe five stars.  I actually used whole, canned jalapenos and cut in half.  I also like the fact they are baked and not fried.  I served with ranch dip on the side.  Great recipe!

I love poppers but didnt want to deep-fry anything.... so I was excited to try this recipe, but it was a little bit much work for me. Prep took a while and getting that coating to stick was tricky. I must have baked mine too long because the jalapenos had become quite mild... I like them to be spicier, personal preference. My family loved them tho. Great alternative to frying, just a bit more work than I anticipated & not quite the flavor I wanted.

Quite tasty, although I will never again make them without gloves! If people do make the same mistake I did, apparently washing hands with lemon juice will break apart the oils much better than soap alone.

These were great. I used panko coating instead of the cereal, and that worked well, though they probably did not stick to the pepper as well as the cereal.  Just make sure you bake the peppers long enough or you end up with some really hot instead of nice and mild.  Also, wear gloves when dealing with the peppers!  I did not and now my hands are burning.

The best poppers I have ever eaten and much healthier than the deep fried version. I made these for a party last Christmas and they disappeared quickly. I am going to make them again this year.  Be sure to wear gloves when handling hot peppers.

Awesome recipe!  Both my husband and I enjoyed this little appetizer. They are even better the next day! I substituted the corn flakes with Kellogg’s new low Carb cereal to make it a little healthier. One word of advice; wear gloves when handling the jalapeno peppers. If you have sensitive skin like I do, your hands will burn for hours!  If it does happen, squeeze half a lemon on your hands to neutralize the oil form the peppers. I would definitely make this recipe for guests.

I was very happy with this recipe. These were just as crispy as fried poppers are, without the added fat. I will make these again. Thanks for sharing!

I usually grow jalapenos in my garden to pickle, but I don't think I'm going to have any left to pickle after trying this recipe.  Delicious.  I'll plant double next year.

Very tasty and pretty easy to make.  I really appreciated a recipe with common ingredients and especially the fact that I don't have to deep fry these.  Not having any cream cheese on hand, I used a bit of sour cream instead.  It was good, but a bit runny.  I'm sure the unmodified recipe is firmer, but I just thought I'd share my experiment results.  :o)

I can't believe how good these were! One of the best recipes I've tried in ages! I followed the directions to a T, and they came out perfect. I had thought the coating wasn't sticking well enough to the peppers, but they tasted perfect. I'll make these again and again! I never thought baked would taste as good as deep fried, but they do. Will be definitely making these for the Superbowl in a few weeks! Friends couldn't believe I'd made them myself! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a really great recipe. Yes it took a little bit of time, but not that bad like some people are complaining!! About a half a hour and I used 14 full sized Jalepeno's. Which ultimately made 28 Poppers. I did take the advice of majority of reviewers and added cayenne, bacon bits,garlic powder to the cr. cheese mixture for extra "bite". YOU ALSO MUST WEAR GLOVES while cleaning Jalepenos, or else your hands will burn for hours afterwards. I held each Jalepeno under running water while slicing and cleaning and it really helped with fumes going in my eyes and down my throat!! I also double dipped each pepper, this helped to keep the crumb mixture on the jalepeno's skin, and  made the cooked jalepeno's crispier. Here is the dipping order i used: egg/milk mixture, flour, egg/milk mixture, breading last- making sure to press breading onto the top of each pepper. I also put the cream cheese filling into a zip lock bag and cut the corner of the bag and piped the filling into each jalepeno half- worked great. I even had a little filling left and we ate it on crackers. Will make these again! Delicious.

I made this for my family and they all loved it so much! I am already making the 2nd batch of it.. Made 1 batch yesterday now 1 batch today. Other peoples reviews say tat it was bland or wasn't good or needed something, it could have been the Jalapeno's you used, best place to get them is Wal-mart they have big Jalapeno's, the have heat and a little kick. They are delicious!!! First I wasn't sure about it with the corn flakes but the corn flakes make it! They add the crunch so you get creamy, soft, and crunch best! I would prefer this recipe instead of going out and buying a big expensive box from the store. Also these Jalapeno Poppers have more flavor! Mind you best place to get the Jalapeno's is Wal-Mart! I love it!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  ONLY thing I did different was add a little chopped jalepeno and garlic to the cheese mixture.  Anyone who says this filling is bland is either not using sharp cheddar, or doesn't realize that most poppers have ONLY cream cheese inside.  This is definitely NOT bland!  The corn flake crust is AMAZING and even though they're baked, they're SUPER crunchy and golden brown!  I did blanche the peppers first, as other suggested, and I double-dipped in the egg/cornflakes.  Absolutely wonderful for a baked version of poppers!  Time consuming for sure... but will make again next year (and might plant extra jalepenos just so there's enough to last awhile!).  I put most of the poppers on a tray and froze them (uncooked) - figuring I can pop them in the oven when I want.  After just a few minutes the crust sets up nicely and you can even move them around without it coming off.  THANKS for a great recipe!

Made these for my 30th Birthday party, they were fantastic. Made the cheese filling and stuffed them the night before then when we were ready I breaded them up. I did add a little smoked Papprika to the cheese mixture.I will be making these again , already have some requests.

These were sooo good. Some of them were really spicy and some were super mild (but that has to do with the peppers not the recipe). I would definitely recommend this recipe!

These were good!  There was plenty of "stuffing" left and I had used 18 peppers, so you could definitely buy a few extras to use it all up.  (It's good just spreading it on crackers, tho!)  I also used bread crumbs.  Served them at a party and my guests liked them and ate them up.

These were actually really, really good! My husband helped me make them. I cut some peppers in half and left others whole (seeding all peppers with a pairing knife). Both types were great! We found that the whole peppers were much more spicy--- which was great for me! The halfed-peppers had very little spice, but delicious nonetheless. I did not pre-cook the peppers like some suggested, but the peppers came out beautifully! I added a little garlic powder and onion powder to the filling (which made them even better)! I cooked them for 35 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Thanks Paula! :)

These poppers are awesome.  I served them at a party recently and everyone requested the recipe.  On a side note, the jalapenos made my hands burn for hours.  Be sure to were gloves when handling raw jalapenos.

It was a lot of work but seemed to be a hit at the party i brought them too.  I would try and over stuff the peppers, otherwise they can be a little bland.

We loved these, but after a few changes... I added alot of fresh cilantro to the mix. i also did a very light flour dredge, then washed again then dredge in panko bread crumbs. The plain panko has been my favoite so far with this recipe. Our garden gave us lots of fresh peppers, we have used the jalapenos, but also banana pepers & hot Italian roasters. I do a whole plate with all 3 types. I also have been cooking them on my pizza stone, perfet! Now for the best ever... i added fresh crabmeat to the mix as well. now that is heaven! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Wow- was really impressed with how easy & delicious these were. Didn't change much but used "light" & low fat items. The kids tore these up and wanted more. Definately a keeper !!!

I made them exactly as the recipe states. Just not good. Deep fried, they're okay. Sorry, but you can't get away without frying them, and if the oil is hot enough, there is hardly any absorption. And if you fry them in a non-transfat oil, better yet. Hardly anyone knows how to deep fry the right way...sigh...

probably would have been 5 starts if I had better jalapenos... did as other suggested and dipped in flour first, then egg, then bread crumbs, egg again, and another round of bread crumbs. they came out nice and crunchy

I reduced cream cheese and the mayo.  Also I replaced the corn flakes with panko flakes.  Personally I prefer poppers with a cheddar or pepper jack etc, only.  Cream cheese is like "deviled " in a crab cake, just the lump crab please.  Seems like a cheap way to strech cheese.

I followed another reviewer's advice and boiled the seeded peppers for 2 minutes before assembling, so they came out nice and soft. I also blended the cheeses in the food processor which gave the filling a nice smooth texture so I could pipe it from a pastry bag into the peppers. Then I rolled them in flour before the egg, and used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. I baked mine at 400 because I had other things in the oven at that temp, but I think it was too hot because the filling sort of exploded out of them. They were tasty, though I think the filling could have used a bit more flavor, maybe some cayenne or garlic or paprika.

This was the first time I made poppers.  Rather time consuming, but fun and delish.  I do believe the peppers need to be blanched first - 1-2 minutes then cooled under running water.  I used an Italian Cheese blend along with the cream cheese & mayo and skipped the egg, just dipping the peppers in milk before rolling in the cornflake crumbs.  Also sprinkled a little extra shredded cheese on top and covered loosely with foil while baking.  Didn't have plastic gloves so used baggies on my hands while cutting & seeding the peppers.

Don't forget to use gloves when handling the peppers! You might want to slice and seed the jalepenos under water they made me cough and wheeze! We used jalepenos out of the garden, blanched them and used Italian breadcrumbs instead of corn flakes. Hubby loved them, YUM!

I only gave these 4 stars a couple years ago, but I finally made them again and I don't know what I was thinking - 5 stars! Like last time, I didn't have cornflakes so I used a breadcrumb/ground oyster cracker combo. I also added 1T bacon bits to the cream cheese, though I couldn't really taste them. Crispy, creamy and delicious, couldn't ask for more!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I gave it a 4 because it does need some tweaking.  Per other suggestions I added hot sauce & cilanto.  I also added garlic powder and used neufchatel rather than cream cheese and threw in a little Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.  We've used both bread crumbs and cornflakes.  My hubby prefers the cornflaskes- but only on the top.  (Don't ask me why...)I also agree that blanching them bakes a big difference. All in all this is a definite keeper!!

These were wonderful! I used crushed Cheeze-Its (garlic and parmesan flavor) to bread and, because many reviews said these lacked heat, I left a few seeds in each ... needless to say, I had everyone at the party crying for a glass of milk! Next time I'll leave the seeds out, but follow everything else.

Very good.  No need to dredge in flour as other reviewers suggested (if you're subbing breadcrumbs, at least). I actually found that they stuck better without dredging.  Served at a birthday party with Pepper & Apple relish (bought at Pepper Palace).  Perfect combo!

Good stuff! Not as crunchy as what you get in a restaurant, but not as unhealthy either! I used less-fat cream cheese and you couldn't tell the difference. One trick is that it's much easier to stuff the peppers if the cream cheese mix is soft. I microwaved it 45-60 seconds and that did the trick.

These were delicious. I didn't boil the peppers first, and they cooked down just fine in the oven. I also didn't add spices to the filling...I just didn't think it needed any. I didn't have corn flakes so I coated them with crushed Fritos. Try it, it's good!

I made these for a cook out. They were gone very quickly. I do recomend either adding some of the seeds to the filling or just adding some red pepper to it. They are not at all spicy with nothing added and thats just not a jalapeno popper to me. Very good with that one change. They do take some time to bread though.

I think they could have been a five...if I would have let them cool down a bit to enjoy the flavor more. 

Here are some of the suggested items I followed:

-Italian seasoning vs corn flakes
-Blanched the peppers for 2 minutes
-Added other spices such as onion powder and garlic powder
-Used a mixture of cheeses (smoked cheddar and moz)

I thought using flour first was a waste of a step. Makes the process very messy.

These were great. I blanched the peppers, rolled the stuffed peppers in flour first, and baked them. I didn't have any corn flakes so I crushed up some tortilla chips. It was very different. Next time I get corn flakes I'll try this again.

This is a great recipe for poppers.  I have made them many times for many different occasions and people love them.  They are always the first to go at gatherings and are always requested by people if I am bringing something for their party. They have great flavor, are nice and crispy, and the peppers are always soft and the perfect texture.  Cleaning the jalapenos is the hardest part but even that is not so bad. I will try the piping method for the filling as somebody mentioned...that sounds like a good way to stuff them.  Try these...you will love them!

These were a huge hit! I must have had larger jalapenos than other reviewers because the inside filling was just enough. Dipping in flour first greatly helped the Italian bread crumbs stick. Might try cereal instead next time for some crunch. Definitely wear gloves as others have suggested!

Excellent. Def Wear gloves - no exception. For low fat poppers, they don't get any better. I used light cream cheese, light cheddar and low fat mayo. Added in garlic salt and crushed red pepper flakes for extra flavor/spice. Def coat in egg/milk mixture so the flakes will stick. I used high fiber bran flakes for an extra health kick. Also great served with a sour cream/salsa dip. Everyone LOVED!

As my husband and I are huge fans of poppers, I've been on the hunt for a baked version.  I think this is a good, basic popper recipe that needs to be kicked up a notch.  I skipped the mayonnaise completely (sorry, but I'm not a mayo fan).   The stuffing is a little bland, so I mixed in finely diced peppers/onions and taco seasoning.  Prior to dipping the poppers into the egg/milk, I dredged them in flour (seasoned w/ Southwestern seasoning).  I also substituted seasoned breadcrumbs.  I've heard if you coat them 2-3 times, the cheese won't ooze out.  I'll try that next time!

These are awesome! A good way to use up extra fresh jalapenos in the fridge.  I didn't have corn flakes on hand, so I rolled them in a blend of two parts pork-flavor Shake and Bake and one part potato flakes. Nice and crunchy.  My fiancee and I loved them, and I'll be making them again soon.

I used monterey jack cheese and they were yummy. I brought it to a party and people loved it. Could use more jalapenos and don't forget your gloves!!!! My hands burned the whole nite! Don't overfill them too much. Coating just the cheese part is just as good and it's less messy and pretty!

These are very good.  I have made them twice for parties and I always get compliments.  The second time I made them - I left out the egg.  I just dipped the cream cheese portion in the corn flakes.  It worked just as well because the corn flakes didn't stick to the green part of the pepper anyway - even when I used the egg.  Saved a step and they came out just as good.

If I could, I'd give this recipe 3.5 stars...it's not quite as good as 4 stars.  They were good, but we didn't care for the crushed corn flakes...I couldn't crush them as fine as I would have liked.  Next time I try them, I will use regular fine bread crumbs.  I'd also like to make the filling a little more interesting...maybe I will add some pepper jack to the sharp cheddar for a little more flavor. I like the fact they are baked...no need to deal with the mess of deep frying! We did enjoy them, I just couldn't get past the corn flakes.

I wanted to tell you the change I made on my recipe...I now use HOT CHERRY PEPPERS since I grew then in my garden last year. Much easier..just cut the steam area off..take seeds out (or leave a few in for more of a kick). The cream cheese mixture fits in neat and doesn't cook messy. They look like mini stuffed green peppers. You might like to try it this way. :o)

I planned on making these for the Super Bowl, but to make sure they would be OK I made a batch Friday Night just to try them out - WOW - 
Didn't have corn flakes so I used a mixture of Bread Crumbs, corn meal and potato flakes - and as others have said, coated with flour before the egg dip, EXCELLENT!!!

These poppers were terrific! Taking a paper towel and gently daubing the excess water out of the pepper will help to reduce "squishy" poppers. Other than that, which was my mistake, this recipe is top notch.

We loved these poppers, i made them for thanksgiving.  I made a few two days before to see how they would turn out and found i hadn't made enough.  The night before Thanksgiving (since we had a 3 hour drive) i made the poppers...let them cool completely and packed them in a container.  On thanksgiving i warmed them up, thoroughly in the oven, they loved them.  Althougth they did taste better the day before, fresh, these were really good too.

This was a unique and great appetizer.  I made it for christmas and it was a hit!  The peppers were very hot, so be sure to wash and seed them with gloves or your hands will be burning hours afterwards!  But after baking it, the peppers were much milder and they were great the day after as well, very cheesy and yummy.

These are delicious! Unless you have huge peppers, you probably will only need about 2/3 of the filling, so you may want to scale back the ingredients.

I made these ahead of time and reheated them in the oven for my guests. I was afraid that the jalapenos would make this dish too spicy but no..I loved them and so did my guests.  I will make this recipe again.

the biggest change that I made was using 3/4  c bread crumbs and 3/4 c  panko bread crumbs.  I let the poppers sit in the frig for 1/2 hr and sprayed them with Pam and baked them at 425 cheese side down for 8 min and flip and finish baking cheese side up for another 8 min.  They turned out like they were deep fried.  If you deep fry only fry for 3 min

Made these tonight with the organic jalapeños that came in my weekly CSA box. Holy cow, they were delicious. I followed some recommendations from the reviews and tailored to my family's taste. My picky hubby said these were the best jalapeño poppers he ever had. Wow!

Here's what I did. (I only mad a half batch). I seeded and blanched the jalepenos for 2 minutes. I mixed the cream cheese and cheddar with 2 dollaps of cholula (hot sauce). (I omitted the mayo, as we don't like that.). I dredged the stuffed jalapeños in flour seasoned with chili powder and cayenne pepper before dipping in egg and bread crumbs. Then I baked as recommended at 359 for 30 minutes. Delish.  A+!

This is very good.   But using Ritz crackers is MUCH better,  also cook the for 45 mins and try to brown top.  That makes them Awesome!   They will fatten YOU UP if you eaten too often!

Basic recipe is good.

I have a suggestion/solution for those who don't wish to use eggs, and those who had problems getting the coating to stick.

I made them the way the recipe read, but I took a previous posters advice and blanched them before baking. This did seem to reduce the heat, and they were more evenly cooked. I also mixed 1 tbsp mayo with a cup of milk for my wet batter. Difficult, but doable.

I digress, the secret I found halfway through battering 12 of them. If one mixes the milk with some breadcrumbs into a paste consistancy, it is possible to fully coat the jalapeno with a thick layer of breading. I dusted mine with the breading again so there would be less to stick to the pan. Really great!

I make this quite often.  I use panko and I don't mind the leftover cheese mix, I use it to stuff celery or serve with crackers.  They freeze nicely and I reheat them in the toaster oven.

Made recipe without modifications and found these to be lacking something.  The consistency of the smooth filling and crunch of the corn flake exterior was very nice but both seemed to be overpowered by the taste of the pepper itself.  I think with a little tweaking based on personal preferences these would be wonderful!

These were pretty good.  I only had a 6oz package of shredded sharp cheddar, so I subbed mexican cheese blend for the remainder and used homemade mayo.  We did have a lot of cheese leftover, like other reviewers mentioned.  I had thought about cutting the proportions of the filling in half, but instead I decided to make the full amount and then I just added a little cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the remainder of the filling mix and served it as a cheese spread for crackers, it was so good!  I refrigerated the filled jalapeno poppers overnight and they still had the problem with leaking out all over the tray when I cooked them.  But the flavor was good and we enjoyed them.  I am going to try freezing the leftovers and reheating them another day.  thanks!

These are delicious!  I made them last night for the superbowl and made them once before to try them out.  the changes I made were: Instead of dredging the entire chili in egg and then the corn flake cereal, I mixed a few Tbs of milk with about a 1/1/2 of panko breadcrumb.  I added 1/4 tsp of cumin & 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper to the milk/panko mixture.  Then, I lined the cheese-filled chilis on a baking sheet and heaped a Tbs on each for a crunch on top.  

They went over very well!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!!!  DO NOT substitute the corn flakes for breadcrumbs, that's what makes this version of poppers special!  After reading some of the reviews, I did as others suggested and boiled the halves for a few minutes before stuffing them with the cheese mixture.  It cooked out any remaining spice which can be good or bad depending on taste.  Refrigerate the stuffed peppers for at least an hour before coating and baking them, it prevents oozing.  Next time I make these I'll add a bit of cayenne to the cheese mixture.

These are really good! They also make a great appetizer to take on a weekend backpacking trip. Keep the jalapeno's whole until you get to your campsite and don't worry about rolling them in bread crumbs, just warm them up in your skillet and they are great on a chilly night in the mountains.

I made these for a casual gathering, and they disappeared before I could turn around.  A little time consuming to prepare, but they are really very good.

I agree with a lot of other people about the filling. It's VERY bland. I added many things to it such as; hot sauce, garlic powder, chili powder, parsley. I also substituted sour cream for the mayo. I did not need to blanch the peppers they were perfectly tender. I did also dredge them in flour before the egg which helped. It is a good starting place for a potentially great recipe.

The pepper texture came out just fine, but the filling is on the bland side. I used bread crumbs instead of cereal and did coat with flour before breading. They hold together very nicely, only a little leakage. I love that they're baked, but they're just bland aside from a little heat from the pepper. Will try again, but will add something........ Not sure what..lol

These were sooooooo delicious. Definitely use sharp cheddar. I used white cheddar. I also used homemade sour dough bread crumbs and I did leave a few seeds for heat. I made them two nights in a row because my hubby loved them!

I didn't follow the ingredients exactly but used lower in fat cheeses and low fat mayo.  I also used Egg Beaters instead of the egg.  I used panko bread crumbs (no corn flakes) and then sprayed them with cooking spray and baked for 35 minutes.  WOWZER!!  Awesome poppers!

Everyone at my football party loved these. I took someone's advice and blanched them in water and coated them in flour before the egg and bread crumbs.  I also made them two days ahead of time and froze them until I was ready for them.

I was surprised at how everybody else said it was so easy to make.  I agreed with the person who said it was time consuming and messy.  I followed plastic baggy and the flour.  I still didn't think it was easy or quick.  The filling was good, though, and we love poppers.  So, I think I will attempt it again.  I didn't love the cornflakes either.  I'll try the bread brumbs next time.

This recipe was wonderful.  We had a couple over for dinner and this was out appetizer.  The only little change was I added a little more mayonnaise. The baking makes this so healthier than frying and I rubbed a little olive oil on the baking pan.  Easy and tasted wonderful!

These are awesome.  I used seasoned bread crumbs as I did not have the corn flakes.  Also cooked the peppers in boiling salted water before stuffing.  Husband and son - both jalapeno popper lovers, absolutely loved these.  Thanks for posting!

Great fun to make, we had something of an assembly line going. I blanced, cut, and stuffed while my wife breaded and, well, you know, stuffed when I was going too slow.  Went well at a party we attended.  Our Jalapeno peppers were kinda duds, we even kept seeds to mix in the spread.  Eh, still tasted good, on that note even kids got to try them.

The ease in wich it takes to prepare combined with the tasty homade results, trump the frozen version found at most restaurant. I served it with marinara and ranch. Only change I made was to use monterey jack cheese in place of cheddar.

We have made this exact recipe several times for ourselves and friends and it always gets fabulous reviews!  It is a little time consuming so I make them early and put them in the fridge until ready to cook.  I actually like the sharp cheese poppers as opposed to the cream cheese ones so the last time I made them with just sharp cheddar and they were awesome, too.  Thanks so much for sharing something that I will never have to buy frozen and deep fry myself again!

What I really like is that it mixes cheddar & cream cheese.  I don't like plain cream cheese poppers, but the smoothness of the cream cheese really made the filling nice with the sharpness of the cheddar.  I was a little worried about the heat of the jalapenos because I can never tell if they are going to be too spicy for people.  These were just perfect.  I did blanche them briefly as other reviewers suggested and that was good, except be sure not to breathe in the steam!  I used bread crumbs because I didn't have any cornflakes.  I bought 24 pretty good sized jalapenos and filled them all because the filling is a lot.  Excellent recipe, I can't wait to make these again!

I used crackers instead of cornflakes, and didn't use quite 8 oz. of cheddar since my kids got into it while I was doing the peppers. I roasted and peeled them. My jalapenos were pretty big and getting dark so these were hotter than *beep*. I did run out of cheese and breading before I made it through them all, double coating w/o making a double batch. Again though, the peppers were huge. Oh, and I also dredged them. These were very time consuming, but very delicious.

These are fantastic and so easy to do!  My family isn't big on the breading, so we skip the last step and just bake the jalapenos with the cheese mixture.  Even my kids love them, and they are always requested at parties!

Totally awesome!  At a campground we frequent these are the #1 requested appetizer.  I wrap the peppers in a half slice of bacon secured with a tootpick and bake at 350 degrees for approximately 30 - 35 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Good!!  I added green onion, crumbled bacon & extra cheddar cheese to the stuffing.  I also left some of the seeds & vains in the Jalapenos.  We like very spicy food.  The Jalapenos came out great.  I made about 75 of them for a weekend get together and they were gone w/in 30 min of taking them out of the oven.  These have already been requested for the next get together.

I did not like these-- I give them 3 stars because my husband gobbled them down. They were bland, despite adding tabasco and chili powder to the filling. Also, the filling was not very creamy, possibly because I used reduced fat cream cheese and there was a good portion of it leftover, despite filling 16 HUGE jalapenos. 

Although I thought I was very careful handling the seeds, I did burn my right hand slightly. If this happens to you, try soaking it in milk for awhile, and don't rinse the milk off. Good luck if you try this recipe-- it is not worth the trouble IMO.

Excellent, EASY recipe.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions of dredging in flour (with a bit of cayenne added) before the egg.  I also added a couple tablespoons of chopped cilantro to the cheese mixture, and used panko instead of cereal.  My jalapenos were about 2 1/2" long X 1" at widest spot.  15 turned out to be the perfect number for the filling amount.  Great!!

This was very good, (I previewed them tonight before I make them for a party later.) Though a few people mentioned they weren't as hot as they would like, and I'm sure many already know this. Jalapeno's differ from pepper to pepper and also it helps to leave a seed or two if you'd like them spicier.

This recipe is outstanding and worth the work. Everyone I have made these for who likes spicy food loves them. I serve these with a sauce recipe I found online that imitates Arby's Bronco Berry sauce. The sauce adds a nice contrast between the sweet sauce and hot jalapeno poppers.

The seeds in a jalapeno are what make it really hot, so if you like these super spicy leave some seeds in. Otherwise, make sure you remove all the seeds. Also, I have found that garden jalapenos usually turn out hotter than store bought, but it may have been a fluke. I agree with other reviewers that you have to protect your hands. My eyes burn when I clean the jalapenos, although I have not protected my eyes.

This recipe is worth keeping even tho the corn flake coating didn't stick too good.   If you eat one that is way to hot you can cool down your mouth & tongue buy eating about 3 bites of white bread (not slices)

I used bread crumbs to coat the jalapenos instead, and that was a BIG mistake. All of it fell of! And there's definetly way too much cheese mixture, half of the mixture would be the perfect amount to stuff the 8 peppers. I loved it though, and I couldn't believe how it wasn't the least bit spicy!

For those who were complaining of the poppers being too hot...I read on another site that the longer you bake the peppers, the milder they will become.  They recommended 40 minutes for mild poppers.  I thought this was a pretty good tip (I haven't actually tested this theory yet, but hopefully it works like they say...coulnd't hurt to try!!)

Awsome. Everyone I have served this to asks where I got the recipe and when I am making it next. Good for Super Bowl partys. I used mixed cheese and special K to make them a little more healthy. make sure you dry out your peppers for at least 1/2 hour (or in the hot sun 15min) to help the flakes stick.

My husband and I loved these.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and substituted bread crumbs for the corn flake cereal.  We ate about half of them and put the rest on a cookie sheet, froze them, and will reheat them for another evening.  I'll make these again when the kids come home from college - they'll flip!

I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and they did not really coat the poppers well.  Also the poppers felt like they needed something to add a little kick.  I hate spicy food but these didn't have that certain something to liven them up.  Like some of the other reviewers suggested I would try using pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar next time.  They are also definately better right out of the oven than reheated.  They did satisfy my craving for jalapeno poppers though!

I used home grown jalepenos & oh my god! Why were they SO hot?? The recipe has great potential to be delicious (the filling & crispy corn flakes were great), but our peppers were so incredibly spicy that they hurt going down!  We love spicy food, but this was ridiculous.

These were great.  I made them for the Super Bowl game.  My husband could not believe I made poppers from scratch.  They have a kick, so they may not be for everybody.  I will definitely make these again.

I couldn't get the corn flakes to stick properly to the jalpeno, but overall this was a big hit. I would add more cheddar cheese to it.

These were really, really good! I’ve never had Jalapeno poppers before. I was given some peppers and I wanted to use them in some way so I found this recipe. Now I only ha like 7 whole jalapeños so I did cut the recipe in half and I didn’t have corn flakes but I had some dill flavored oysters crackers so I put them in the food processor.  They were delicious. You have to give them a try!

I made it for my office potluck, a majority of my co-workers are Indian vegetarians. I did some suggestions in other reviews by using a bag to squeeze out the filling but still used a spoon to smooth it out. I also dipped it in flour beforehand but not sure if it helped or not.  I also had seasoned panko breadcrumbs so I used that instead of cornflakes. Anyway they came out good, none of it leaked out like some other people said it did, but I didn't overfill them. I filled it just enough and the breadcrumbs stayed on.

We LOVE this recipe. Definitely 5 stars! I copied it down in 2012. We had a bumper crop of jalapenos that year and needed something to do with them.  Found this recipe and have been using it ever since. (I also discovered there's a jalapeno knife!) 

I haven't made any changes to it—we love it as is! I think part of what makes it so good is we have to wait to enjoy it until we get enough of our own peppers. Jalapenos at the grocery store are SO expensive.

I've even used this recipe with banana-type peppers, but you can't beat the jalapenos!

These were great!  Loved that they were no-fry. I blanched my peppers for 2 minutes and drained.  I also added  a 1/4 tsp.  each of cayanne pepper, paprika and dry mustard to the cheese mixture.  Filled using the baggie method (freezer bag worked best, my first bag burst),  pressed the filling fully into the pepper using a chopstick, then refrigerated overnight to allow the flavors to meld.  The next day I did the flour, egg, corn flake thing and ended up baking for 40 minutes.  They turned out great.  Since they were on the mild side, I think next time I'll leave the ribs in and maybe add a pinch of seeds to the cheese mixture.

I loved this recipie! I added 1T fresh chives and  1T ground flaxseed to the filling, plus 1T ground flaxseed the cereal crumbs, also used puffed rice cereal instead of cornflakes. Short on time, I baked at 400 for 20 minutes. They were perfectly crunchy and delicious!

Very easy, and delicious. A great alternative to deep fried, for those who prefer not to eat fried food. Wearing disposable gloves is very helpful when handling the jalapeños so oils from them don't inadvertent transfer to places on your body you don't want them (i.e. Your eyes!)

I don't  dip them in the egg.  I just crush the cornflakes and sprinkle the on the tops. I take them to work and they vanish fast. Nothing like poppers and coffee at 8 am in the morning.

My family loves these. I as others have made a few changes. I used bread crumbs. I also dredged and coated them 2x, waiting for them to dry in between to make a better crust. I added some of the seeds back into the stuffing as well as tobasscco to add more heat. I also sprayed the pan and the top of the peppers with evoo before baking. We always make a lot and freeze them for later.

This usually wouldn't be my thing, but someone gave me a bag of jalapenos and we were having a labor day party. They were really easy and good. I removed most seeds so they weren't super hot. The cereal didn't stick very well though.

This was a very yummy dish & a little time consuming, but simple to make.
Since this was a spur of the moment thought, I had to use Italian breadcrumbs instead of the corn flakes & Pepper Jack cheese instead of cheddar (which helped with the spice since my peppers were on the mild side.)
I had fresh Banana Peppers on hand too and this really worked well with them also!

Loved these. They turned out great! Slit the jalapeños down one side, but kept them whole. Stuffing mostly stayed inside this way. Otherwise, no changes.

This recipe was amazing!! I needed to use a lot more corn flakes than recipe called for!! Seeing egg mixture made it clumpy, I don't see any need to blanch peppers!! Unless you don't like the spicy after bite!! My daughter who does not care for spicy ate 4 of them & loved em!! However! I highly recommend using gloves while seeding peppers!! My hands burned for hours after seeding & cleaning them! I guess that makes me a novice working with hot peppers! I also used extra sharp cheddar cheese & let mixture sit for about a hour so it could be mixed throughly! I really don't see need for egg & milk mixture! I ran out of mixture and just rolled them in corn flakes, no difference in taste! Also baked longer than recipe called for!! More like 45 mins!! Huge hit!! Will make again!!

Made these without cornflakes and substituted all purpose flour.  Baked for 30 and then under the broiler for 4 mins.  We love spicy food so also used a habanero infused cheddar and it was fantastic!

These are tasty! I love that they are baked. I used panko breading as someone suggested. Definitely crunchy this way. I also used fresh, from the garden Jalapeno's and definitely had plenty of spice. I did what several recommended since it made so many and froze leftovers after they cooled off. This made more then 30 halves. I think I used 24 jalapenos so have a few extra on hand just in case. Can't wait to use them reheated without the hassle. They are a bit time consuming but very worth it. Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't overly impressed with these.  I had a hard time getting the corn flakes to stick and it was very messy.  So I gave up and just sprinkled the remaining ones with corn flakes on the top, then drizzled them with butter.  They got fairly soggy on the bottom and I was a little disappointed with that.  I also thought the filling left a lot to be desired.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I use ricotta, and fat free cream cheese. An I use bread crumbs instead of cereal.

Uhhh loved it! I cut thin provolone cheese slices for the bottom (didn't have the cheddar) and put the (low fat) cream cheese on top. Skipped the mayo and egg milk coating, but left the corn flakes and they were still delicious!

I'm a big fan of jalapeno poppers but had never made them myself before. This was super easy to make. Given the reviews stating the the breading was somewhat messy and complicated and because we don't like breading much, I decided to skip that step. They were sooo good! We didn't miss the breading at all. I couldn't stop thinking about them all week, so I just put another batch in the oven. I have no doubt they will be a big hit at our next get together. Thanks!

Excellent.  I had an abundance of banana peppers and used those adding chopped pickled jalapeno to the stuffing mix.  Everyone loved these as much as using the jalapeno peppers.

My husband loved them and they are a nice alternative to the fried version.  I would suggest to add crumbled bacon to the mix and pepper jelly makes a nice dip.

Certainly not as tasty as the fried ones, but much lighter and healthier (as much as a cheese filled item CAN be). My only complaint is that the bread crumbs did not stick to the pepper, only the cheese. I guess that was to be expected.?.? Very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe!  I breaded only the top and left the bottom so the green would show for color.

Some I didn't bread at all but did put them in the oven.  Those I thought were a little greasy and was wondering if I left the mayo out of the ones I didn't bread if that would help... or maybe next time I will just put the ones in the oven that are breaded and not heat the others.
I would make these again!

Good base recipe, although I agree with the other reviews about blanching the jalapenos and adding more spices to the cream cheese mixture (I add tons of cilantro and cayenne pepper). In addition, it's a lot easier to let the mixture sit at room temperature before stuffing, then refrigerating the poppers for a couple of hours before breading and baking. I also dredged the poppers in flour before dunking in egg (not milk) and then the bread crumbs.

Made these with peppers from the garden. Gave them an extra coating or two giving extra attention to the ends. I cut the ends off and stuffed them that way. We also used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the corn flakes and deep fried them. We thought we made too many but ended up eating them all that night!

These were amazing and DELICIOUS!  We thought the cheese filling needed a bit of paprika and cayenne.  Just be sure to remove each seed and use disposable gloves with the fresh jalapenos.  The juices are so dangerous!  Very tasty.  Loved it Paula, thank you!

I made these for our Moose Lodge for Sun. Football.  They didn't last thru the first quarter!!! They are great.  I followed the recipe but I did only use 1 tbs. mayo, panko crumbs and drizzled with butter so they were crispy.

I followed suggestions made by others who've tried the recipe - flouring the peppers first, adding bacon, double breading - one thing I would do next time is drizzle melted butter over the top of the poppers before they go in the oven. Although they were super tasty - they were lacking that crunch, I was looking for.

I found they taste just as good without all the fuss have putting a coating on them, just wrap a strip of bacon around them and put them in the oven. Also the sharp cheddar with some minced garlic and the herb cream cheese make a difference to the flavour.

These were good, though I would probably add some salt to the cheese mixture to enhance the flavor. They were fairly easy to make. And I would recommend eating them while they are still hot so that they are still spicy.

These jalapeno poppers weren't horrible, but my main complaint was that I could not taste the cream cheese. I made them exactly as recommended and found myself tasting pretty much just the jalapeno. Not sure why, but very disappointing!

These were good poppers, but I do not consider this a 5 star rating.  The cheddar cheese didn't seem to fit well, I would use a different cheese next time.  The piping bag to add the mixture to peppers was a wonderful suggestion by a previous poster.  These were yummy, but not a recipe I'd save!

These were very good but next time I'll leave more of the viens in for more heat.  I used a grapefruit spoon under running water to scrape the seeds and ribs out.  It only took a few seconds per half. We don't have corn flakes so I seasoned some homemade breadcrumbs with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.. very good! Next time I'll try some garlic in the cream cheese for extra flavor.  Very good, thanks for the recipe

My first attempt at Jalapeno Poppers came out great! Took a lot longer to prep than I expected due to the seeding process. I used jalapenos I grew at home and they were smaller than normal so I only used half the filling and half of the cheddar. I think that something was missing. It was spicy, but maybe if I dipped it in something it would've been better. A friend tasted them and suggested dipping these in warmed raspberry jelly before eating. I'll have to try that next time. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

So good! It takes a bit of time getting all the seeds out, but it is so worth it! We were four adults for dinner and there was no poppers left! The proportions for the filling were perfect, and the cheese really smoothed over the spiciness of the jalapenos. I put bread crumbs on top, and it worked great. Thank you for this recipe!

These were good. I made half the filling as other people had stated they had alot left over. I ended up with the perfect amount. I will make these again. My husband like them and he doesn't even like poppers! We too did not miss the fact they were not fried. Thanks for the recipe its a keeper.

Okay, Everyone reallllly loved these. Even those who said they HATED Jalapenos. I added salt on top of the cream cheese AFTER spreading it. I froze the rest and will be baking them again tonight!

This was great but to crunchy. I did not blanch first. However I did add the other seasonings someone else suggested, I used half of the cream cheese, not my favorite ingredient. I cooked for 30 min. I did ran out of breadcrumbs so ended up using corn meal for the second half which was ok. Going to freeze the rest and try deep frying to soften them up.

Delicious! The time it takes to make these poppers is time well spent. Much better than I have had  in any restaurant. Great way to use all those jalapenos from the garden. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made these too many times to count and every time I do they are gone before I get a chance to sample them. When I make them for someone who has never tried them before  I then get recruted to make the for every occassion. I am known as the "POPPER LADY" ;)

These are wonderful! I used non-dairy "sour cream" (Tofutti Sour Supreme) instead of mayo and panko instead of crushed cornflakes. I also added a bit of black pepper and chili pepper powder to both the bread crumbs and cheese filling. Very easy and I love that these are baked and not fried.

Made these for the hubby and some friends (I can't do peppers and I'm allergic to mayo so I'll have to go by what they say). Everyone liked them and cleaned them up.  Time well spent.

These were great! I did tweak the recipe just a bit..instead of corn flakes, i used 1/2 italian breadcrumbs, 1/2 crushed french fried onions. I thought the creamcheese mixture could use some seasoning...my huband gave this 5 stars though. Said they were better than the store-bought kind! So I will definately make these again!!

OMG- these were so incredibly good. My friend and I made these last night and I ate so many I skipped Weight Watchers today! We blanched the peppers first and the fumes nearly knocked my kids out so be careful if you go that route. I'll need to invest in an oxygen mask next time I do that. We used a sharp cheddar cheese with bacon in it then dredged in flour before using the egg/milk wash. Added chili powder and cayenne pepper to the cornflakes. They were messy but fun to make! I think the cornflakes really make a difference! Definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good, but I can't get over the poppers that Lone Star used to have so I can't give 5 stars..I subbed some Pepper Jack cheese for part of the cheddar hoping to give it more flavor. I also added some crumbled bacon and blanched the peppers for about 5 mins. They were still crisp afterwards, so I didn't really like that.

Made these for a party, they came out very good.  They're a bit messy to put together, but have fun with it.  If I made them again, I'd use smaller proportions, since I had a lot of the cheesy mixture left over.

Pretty good, but the recipe as is, could use a bit more flavor, in my opinion.  I added crushed garlic and onion powder to the filling, and it could've used more salt.  Also, not rating the recipe based on this because I know it depends on the peppers, but mine weren't hot at all and definately could've used some kick in the filling (and that's coming from a person who thinks mild sauce is too hot!)  I will definately make these again, only adding some more flavor next time.

I made these for my husbands weekly poker night and I was told they were gone in minutes.  Did not have the leaking problem, maybe because I made them ahead and refridgerated them, then the guys baked them when they were ready.

Delicious but I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 1/2 crushed tortilla chips and 1/2 crushed Cool Ranch Doritos for the coating - awesome - everyone raved about them.

I made them for New Year's Eve and they were a hit.  I hollowed out the peppers instead of slicing in half but then ended up having a hard time getting the breading to stick.  The whole pepper adds to the spice, which everyone liked.

These are really good, but a little too hot for my taste. I liked them, but wasn't a big fan of the coating on the outside. It seemed like it didn't cover the jalapeno enough. Overall pretty good though.

Dangerous to make if you don't wear gloves (I didn't) and value your eyes (I should have read all the reviews). Not sure what else I may have done wrong. I like jalapeno poppers and so I expected these to be hot and spicy, but these were hot and spicy to the point of comedy.

Made these for my boyfried (his reward for painting our room all day), and he loved them. I don't even like jalapeno peppers and I liked them myself. Will use this recipe again, thanks!

These were really good. I had trouble getting the cornflakes to stick, but they were still good. My brother and boyfriend really liked them.

tried this on Christmas eve 2004.  I wasn't impressed.  I was expecting more zip... and there really wasn't any.  My family loves hot and spicy food.  The only heat was from the temp of the oven.  Definately will lose this recipe.  Not worth it.

We have made these several times and loved them!  I even took them to a potluck at work and they were eaten very quickly!  For some reason, I have become very sensitive to the jalapenos juice and oil, so now my hubby makes them...this makes them even better!

I made these last month at a party we had and they were a hit! I had changed the cheese and used jack and monterey, and bread crumbs instead of corn flakes.
We are having a Mexican dinner on Christmas this year and will make them again.
Thanks for the great recipe!

These were very, very good. And a lot cheaper than buying them from a grocery store.

I made these for a dinner party.  I just thought these were okay, but my guests thought they were fantastic.  I guess that's what counts!  What I did like was that they were baked rather than fried, and they weren't to hot for those with more "delicate" taste buds.

The corn flakes gave the outside a nice crunch.  I would like them a little hotter.  It's much easier baking than frying.
