Instead of adding water and thickening with crackers, make more gravy using the same liquid and dry ingredients in the recipe (sans meat, of course), bring to a boil, thicken with a flour and water mix and add back to the cooked meat.  This will look and taste like the product at places like National Coney Island, or Ted's in Port Huron. PS, leave out the Cayenne.  These restaurants do not use this.  If you like hot, go ahead, but this isn't used in the restaurants, at least not at this strength.

Thank you. Since we moved to Iowa, we have to wait for the big road trip to get a decent coney. Thanks for bringing Detroit back home to us. Go WINGS.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  My husband was born and raised in Port Huron and he always raves about the PH Coney sauce. I've never tried to make it myself so on Father's Day I decided  to search and make some.  Wow, for this recipe to pop up.  I followed it to the T and it was PERFECT.  A big hit at my party and my husband loved it.  A keeper!  Thanks so much.  OH, and the potato masher tip.  Never thought of it before.  YOU ROCK!

Not sure what's goin on in Port Huron, but this is definitely not what I was expecting for a Coney sauce.  It was OK for what it was but I won't be making it again.  Gonna keep searching for the real Detroit Coney sauce.

I was out of ground mustard. Instead of a potato masher, I used a whisk to break up the meat in the water and spices. I doubled the recipe and let it cook for several hours. Everyone loved it, they not only used it on the dogs, they used it on the fries too. The recipe sounds weird, not browning the meat first, but it was so tender. This coney sauce was the best I've tasted.

Good but not "real" Michigan Coney Island chili. There is no tomato base. Places like Leo's Coney Island and many many many coney islands have the real deal. Good for what it is but not Michigan coney chili.

We really liked this...Coney sauces are all different anyways so this one isn't my ultimate favorite but it's pretty addicting. Tastes kinda like Skyline chili. I didn't have beef base so I added beef stock instead of the water. I also was out of onion powder so I added minced onion-I actually spilled it in there & was going to fish it out but decided it would just rehydrate & be fine & it was. I also added a bit of celery seed. Yum. Would give this 4.5 stars if I could

Pretty good. I am here in TX and not quite accustomed to chili sauce like this one. I added a little salt and didnt do the beef base. Turned out really delicious. And GO WINGS!

I do not eat red meat, but I made this for my daughter's first birhday party (the theme was Coney's and Cake).  The sauce didn't turn out as "saucy" as I see it in restaurants, but everyone liked it.  In fact, the pot was scraped clean!

Port Huron's own "Downtown Coney Island" (DCI) is the standard by which I judge coney island sauce.  I appreciate the regional differences of the Coney Dog but if you love the unique flavor of DCI's sauce you will be very satisfied with this recipe.  My wife, Julie, is a multi-generational Huronite who turned me on to the DCI scene in the first place and she loved my redition of this recipe.  I didn't change a thing except I did salt it up to my taste.  I'd give it a 4.5

Really good. I made it like the recipe said and not quite what Port Huron's Coneys are like but pretty close. I'll probably make this again but play with the sauce a bit.

A former Michigander in Phoenix, AZ found herself craving a good ol' fashioned coney. Man, oh man, did I hit the gold mine when I found this recipe. Even people who don't know what a coney is (crazy I know) will love this!

This reminded me a lot of Cincinnati Skyline style chili with the flavors of cinnamon and allspice. I haven't eaten a coney in Michigan so I can't say how this compares, but I was looking for a coney sauce like my favorite Greek Coney Island place back home makes. This is similar in texture, but not quite the same flavor as the Economu's recipe. I really liked this quite a bit and added a very generous amount to my coney dog. I used a wire whisk to break the meat up and it worked great. I didn't know exactly what beef base was, so I used a beef bullion cube. I didn't need to add the crackers to thicken as mine was already thick. I cut this down to make 2 servings and used approx. 1/3 lb. of ground beef. I didn't have garlic powder but found some grated garlic in my fridge, so that is what went in the pot. I will definitely fix this again. I only let this simmer for 2 hours and it was fine. We were too hungry to wait any longer.

Having never been to Port Huron, I didn't know quite what to expect.  I was looking for a coney sauce to replicate the one from my partner-in-crime's childhood.  He described it as "more chili-like than sweet with a little kick, but not too much".  I will say that I went a little heavier on the onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, paprika and chili powder.  I also used dry mustard instead of prepared mustard because as long as I was rooting around in the spice cabinet for all these spices, why not?  I also happened upon some celery salt while in the cupboard and used about a 1/2 tsp of that.  I did not add the crackers at the end as having cooked this sauce for a couple of hours, it was already perfectly thick.  I kind of thought it weird that there was no tomato product of any kind in this sauce, but in the end, it did not need it.  It was perfectly spiced and "almost exactly" what I was looking for.  This one is going in the five star file and I will be using it from now on.

Sorry, I found the allspice and cinnamon to be overwhelming and distracted from the flavor. I have never had a coney that tasted like that in PH or elsewhere.

This is the second time I have made this sauce. My husband & I love it!  This is very close to the hot dog sauce served in Buffalo, NY at Towne Texas Hots, a Greek restaurant we go to whenever we are in the area.

This is an excellent 'Coney Sauce,' although a bit different from the usual one.  It got high approval ratings from my family.  Will I make it again?  You bet I would!

i loved this recipe, however my family of 5 was divided about it.  i think some prefer the tomato/ chili flavored sauces over this.  either way it was very good over all beef hot dogs and topped with finely diced onions,  I'll make it again!

I am born and raised in Port Huron.  I have had many coney dogs from Sam & Joe's, Coney Island (Downtown) and Teds.  This recipe did not resemble the flavor of any of those.  And the cayenne pepper made it spicy.  It was definitely missing something and I needed to add more water to make more gravy.  I added a few sprinkles of splenda so that it wasn't so spicy.  It was ok, but I will eliminate the cayenne pepper next time and maybe some kind of tomato base.  I will experiment with it til I get it right.

Excelent. Its alittle time consumeing but worth it. I,ve made it 2xs this time I bumped up the cinammon to 1/2 tsp. but wasnt needed. I also browned burger then mixed all ingred. in food processor first till burger was ground extremly fine . This saves a good hour and half of simmering. I simmered in stove 45 min. then put in smoker for hour or so on 215 deg with cherry wood. What an awsome flavor that adds.
