This is a great recipe to help clean out the refrigerator crisper.  I had some crushed pineapple and also some chunks that I sliced up into smaller bits.  I had alot of apples I needed to use, so used mostly apples and pineapple, with the exception of a few grated carrot.  I added an extra tsp. of cinnamon; didn't have nuts.  After I got the batter made I felt it lacked a little something....back to the crisper.  Lo and behold, there was an orange that was just waiting to be rubbed against the microplane.  I added the zest of the entire orange.  The combination of apple, pineapple, carrot, cinnamon, and the orange zest was perfect!  I could smell the cinnamon and zest while baking.  I didn't overdo the coconut; added just the 3/4 cup, as I have found that when I overdo it on coconut to sweet breads, it tends to be crumbly.  These were perfect.  The recipe made 12 Texas-sized muffins and baked for 25 minutes at 375.  They look like a picture with the different colors and bits.  I didn't peel the apples..just grated it right in...love the faint pinkish red color it gives the muffin.  I was tempted to sub applesauce for the oil but didn't...that would make it even more healthy.

Great recipe.  In my effort to make them "healthier", here are my subs:In place of one of the 2 cups of flour, I use 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour, 1/2 c. of oat bran and 1 TBSP of wheat germ.  In place of the 1/2 c. of oil, I use 1/4 c. and 1/4 c. plain lowfat yogurt.  In place of the 1-1/4 c. sugar, I use 3/4 c of sugar and 1/4 c of honey.  Other changes:  use golden raisins in place of the dates.  I add a dash of cloves and a couple dashes of nutmeg.  Instead of grating the apples (I use Granny Greensmith), I chop them finely.  Sometimes, I even add a small can of drained, crushed pineapple!

These are a new favorite and a great way to have veggie and fruit in the morning. I omitted dates as I didn't have any and don't like coconut. I also replaced half of the oil with applesauce and sprinkled a packet of instant apple oatmeal on the tops of the muffins before baking. This added an extra apple/sweet flavor. They went incredibly fast as we all for them as a snack throughout the day, but they only got more moist as they sat. Thanks for the recipe.

Changes:
Went for half whole wheat flour, half white, split the oil with applesauce, and threw in some shredded zucchini, flax seed, and soy protein for good measure. Replaced sugar with Splenda for baking. Also made 12, not 18 muffins. 

I used pre-shredded carrots, but I think I would have been better off shredding them myself- it threw off the texture a bit.    

Slightly undercooked in the middle of the bigger ones, but that's my fault. They are delish, and I imagine they're pretty good for you with my modifications.

"These are the best  muffins I've had!" was my husband's reaction to tasting these muffins.  It didn't make 18 muffins though- only 12.  Very moist muffin with a lot of texture.  I also replaced 1/2 cup of flour with wheat flour which added a bit of flavor and I didn't use the dates.

These were fantastic!  I substituted crushed pineapple for the the apple and apricots for the dates so that I didn't have to shop for ingredients.  They came out exactly as what my tastebuds were craving - moist, sweet and delicious!

Among the many muffins I bake, I make this recipe over and over.  The muffins are moist and tasty; they freeze well.  They are always a hit.  Folks often ask for the recipe.  The preparation is, however, labor intensive -- peeling, chopping, grating!

Great recipe - I will make these again. However, they'd be TOO SWEET as written. I only added 3/4 cup sugar instead of the 1 1/4 cups, and next time I will try with only 1/2 cup sugar. They were quite sweet with the 3/4 cup! I also didn't have coconut on hand, so I omitted that (without replacing with anything), and they were still delish. I omitted the vanilla b/c I didn't want these to be overly cake-tasting. Finally, I used olive oil instead of veg oil - works a treat! Note that the batter is SUPER THICK - I was worried at first! But they turned out beautifully.

My family LOVED these muffins! We use to buy Morning Glory Muffins years ago from a bakery that's too far out of our way now. I was thrilled to find this and two other recipes here for the muffins. I made a double batch, baked some in tiny tins (about 10 minutes) and some in really big tins (about 22 minutes). Be careful to take these out at JUST the right time, as a minute or two makes a big difference. I'm going to try the other recipe with wheat germ and apple butter next!

Good, but to sweet.  Use 3/4 cup sugar instead!  Change the dates for dried cranberries...

Yummy! I doubled the recipe and made two loaves of bread! I made it for my toddler so I did make some changes to make it healthier. I used 3 cups flour, 1 cup oatmeal. Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup white sugar.  I only used 4 eggs, because I didn't think it needed 6 for the doubled recipe. I used half oil, half applesauce. Omitted pecans and dates, personal preference. Added cloves, nutmeg and all-spice. Delicious!

These muffins are fabulous. I've made them twice as muffins and once as a carrot cake. I didn't have any dates so I used golden raisins. When I made this into a cake, I added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar and baked it for 40 minutes in a 9x13 cake pan. Also topped it with cream cheese frosting. Got rave reviews as both muffins and as a cake.

I have made these muffins after I bought a tub of the batter from a fund raiser.  This is just like the batter with the exception of pineapple.  Highly recommended.

This recipe is great! Have been in search of a moist muffin mix with wholesome goodness...just made 'em and ate 'em (not ALL! of them). Will be perfect for toting to work. I used the idea of replacing 1/2 cup of white with whole wheat flour and crushed walnuts instead of pecans -- also had no coconut. Both Doggie-Daddy and I will heartily enjoy them! THanks.

These are fantastic!! Great flavour and texture. I made them with half whole wheat flour and they were still tender due to the fruits and veggies. Also did 1 c apple, 1 c canned pineapple and 1 c carrot instead of just carrot and apple. You can reduce the sugar if you use sweetened coconut - I reduced to 1 c and could have reduced it another 1/4 cup but no complaints - they are delicious!!

This recipe even earned a "oh my that's yummy" from my husband who doesn't like coconut!  I subbed raisins for dates (I didn't have any) and didn't add pecans (so the baby can eat them to).  We all really enjoyed them!

These are delicious! The kids loved helping make them, and they love the flavor. Added a can of crushed pineapple and left out the dates and coconut. Did 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose. Added some honey and took the sugar down- absolutely the best muffins I have ever baked!

YUMMMMMY!!  Took the idea to add the apple cinnamon oatmeal for a little extra apple flavor.  Bake time could be a little less, maybe 16-18 min.  Helps it to be less dry.

These were delicious, though I admit I (like everyone else, apparently) altered them to suit my taste/what I had on hand.  I used all apple instead of apple and carrot, raisins for the dates (will do cranberries next time, I think), and left out the nuts because my friends are picky.  The muffins turned out moist and yummy, and I had so much batter I ended up making some mookies as well, to which I added about a cup of rolled oats and a little bit of extra flour... those were even better!

This was so good! I was lazy and didnt' grate my apples. I minced them instead. Did the same with the carrots. Also, no coconut or dates - still really turned out lovely and my husband and I have a delicious breakfast to grab as we run out the door.

I used a full cup of shredded coconut and extra vanilla (double), and omitted the raisins altogether. These turned out perfectly - a hearty, wholesome breakfast muffin. I will definitely add it to my baking rotation!

I left out the dates and the pecans, my children don't like them, and these muffins came out delicious. I guess I made them bigger than I should; I only got 14 muffins instead of 18.

Ok, I made these muffins and I have to tell you-THEY ARE GREAT!!!  However, I did alter the recipe a little (OK A LOT!)
But I added stuff and used different nuts.  I added blueberries (instead of using dates)...I substituted almonds for pecans....and I added a cup of (fiber enriched) bran flakes pureed in the food processor (but you have to use more oil)...But instead of using oil, I use Best Foods Mayo (1 1/2 cups)---makes muffins super moist...and I had to use one more egg and I also added 1 cup of organic apple sauce.  Oh yeah, I also used Splenda baking sugar instead of regular sugar....Instead of muffin cups, I made mini-loaf muffins and they turned out SOOOOOO good and SOOOOOO yummy!!!  This is a definite KEEPER recipe...

Excellent!  I followed recipe exactly and they turned out moist and rich, just sweet enough.  I agree with the suggestions of substituting cranberries for the dates, swapping walnuts for pecans, adding or subbing pineapple for some of the apple and carrots as variations on the original, and I plan to do just that in the future, but I will also continue to make the original recipe too. Thanks for posting such a great recipe!   
NOTE--My yield came out as 12 regular size and 34 mini's, as I filled the muffin tins about 2/3 full.

This is THE BEST recipe EVER!

I have used this recipe many times.  It gets tweaked depending on what I have in house but the basic ratios of the recipe are near perfect. I cut the sugar down a bit and usually use a combination of brown sugar and Spenda.  I usually add some ground flax for fiber if its handy.

I used half whole wheat flour, skipped the coconut, chopped the apples and substituted 1/2 cup of honey for the sugar. They turned out beautiful and tasty.
Four stars because the recipe as written would have been much too sweet, especially with the naturally sweet carrots, apples, and dates.

These were absolutely amazing. Do not have a strong carrot taste but is a great blend of flavors. I didn't add the pecans but followed the recipe exactly. However for my second batch I only had a small amount of coconut left so I added the remaining of that and just added more dates. Would never have known the difference. Those who have eaten it enjoyed the muffins very much and went back for seconds.

These are delicious! They bake nicely. Quick oats are important. I had only regular oats so my muffins were rather dense. But they worked okay anyway.

My version: (vegan!) 1/2 c whole wheat flour+1 1/2 c all purpose flour 3/4 c sugar 1 1/2 tsp baking soda 2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp salt 1 c grated carrots 3/4 c grated apples 3/4 c coconut 3 Tbsp corn starch 5/8 c applesauce 1/4 c canola oil 1/2 tsp vanilla *Took much less time to bake, only like 12 minutes. Also, only yields about 12 regular sized muffins. These are wonderful though, not too sweet and very hearty.

YUM! I messed around with the recipe a bit but I'll still give it five stars 'cause I think the original would be amazing too, or even better - I didn't have dates or nuts, so I didn't use them, but I bet they would have been great. I cut back on the sugar a bit as suggested, and subbed in some brown sugar for some of the white. I had a can of crushed pineapple that I drained and used instead of the apple pieces. So basically I used this recipe for carrot cake muffins =) and they were delicious! Obviously a very versatile recipe.

I substituted half of the flour with wheat flour, coconut oil instead of vegetable and half of the sugar with unrefined organic sugar. I used a juicer for the carrots & apples to make them more digestable, which after combining juice and pulp amounts to approx. 1 c. each (rather than 1.5 c). Note that the batter is thick and sticky. Also, I added 1/2 c. dried pineapple pieces (soaked for an hr in water then drained) and a tbs of dried orange zest. Muffins turned out great and extremely moist!  They also freeze well.

I personally didn't try the muffins, but gave them to a volunteer group as well as a few to a friend. When asked, they rated them between 4 and a half to 5. I followed the recipe to a tee. I will make them again.

By far the best muffin I have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. How nice to get away from raisins and walnuts and have delicious dates and peacans! That coupled with healthy carrots, apples (I used granny smith) and coconut....HEAVEN!

These were okay.  I'm still rating it a 4 because I didn't use nuts.  I like this muffin, but I think it needs some butter for flavor.  Maybe use 2 tbsp of melted butter instead of vegetable oil.

These muffins are FANTASTIC!  I did change it slightly for personal taste--all whole wheat flour, apple sauce instead of oil, raisins and walnuts for dates and pecans.  I diced the apple because I wanted the texture.  Next time I'm going to add oatmeal.  This is a moist and flavorful breakfast treat!

I was worried that the texture would be weird, seeing all the coarsely grated carrot and apple in the bowl, but they turned out really quite smooth!  Chunky enough to make them interesting, the flavour is nicely spread around.  A nice wintry muffin, I'd recommend adding a lot of extra cinnamon (I did 1.5 teaspoons, but next time I'll add more).  Might be good with nutmeg?  To turn into a real treat, try adding a cream cheese carrot cake icing.  Tastes like carrot cake.  Pineapple might make this a bit more like traditional carrot cake, but they're nice they way they are.  Sugar just about right!  Think I'll try applesauce instead of oil next time.

These are the best morning glory muffins I've ever had!  Like some of the others here I modified slightly...I substituted a combination of craisins and dried cherries for the dates, I squeezed all the water our of the grated apple and I used slightly less sugar than called for. My family LOVED them and we will most definitely make them again.

TURNED OUT GREAT...THESE MUFFINS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.I USED A LITTLE LESS CINNAMON (1 1/2 TEASPOONS) AND USED 1/2 CUP APPLEBUTTER INSTEAD OF OIL. THE APPLEBUTTER HAS A NICE FLAVOR THAT COMPLIMENTS THESE MUFFINS.

These are very good.  I just used what I had in my cupboard which ended up being apples, carrots, coconut, dried cranberries and hazelnuts.  I also used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white.  Next time to make them healthier, I will eliminate some of the sugar and fat by replacing some of it with honey and flax seeds.  Delicious!

These were fantastic and I have never been overly fond of muffins before.  I decided to try them in my kids lunch box and they loved them.  The only changes I made were to substitute mixed dried fruit for the dates and reduce the sugar and use some honey instead.  They come out great and I will definitely make them again.

I was not at all impressed with these muffins.  I did not find them moist at all.  I omitted the dates, and it definately was lacking something.  If I were ever to make these again, I would take the advice of previous reviews and add pineapple to the recipe.

I really liked these muffins...  I made the recipe exactly and they turned out well, although I think my oven was a little hot and they were almost underdone with very dark tops.  I froze them in little baggies and they seem to thaw out ok, not too mushy.  Luckily I have a food processor to do all the shredding!

really made no changes except omitting the coconut and using walnuts instead of pecans. My son and husband love these and they keep really well.

Loved it!  Great basic Morning Glory recipe!!  Because of what I had on hand I did substitute.  Carrots for Zucchini and Pineapple for Apple.  Super good!  It made 12 big muffins.

great muffin. I entered it in the county fair and I won 2nd place.
the only change that I made was hand stirring the flour into wet ingredients so that I did not over mix . i also changed the temp to 350 instead of 375.

I loved these muffins, however my husband and finicky 3 year old  daughter did not. Next time I they might be coerced if I add a little cream cheese frosting (kind of defeats the purpose of my "healthy" substitutions!) But, if you want to make these healthier, I substituted the oil for 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup of  sour cream.  I also followed the lead of other reviewers and only used 3/4 cup of sugar- this was plenty sweet! This is also a very forgiving recipe, as I realized I only had 2 eggs (not 3).  I also substituted the dates with 1/2 cup raisins,  omitted the pecans due to a nut allergy, and omitted the vanilla because I didn't have that either! I enjoyed these muffins very much, thanks for the recipe.

Made these this morning.  Excellent! Read the reviews, cut back on sugar, a little less on coconut and just a few craisins instead of dates.   Always add about 2 tbls wheat germ.  Cooked of for 30 minutes  375 Then reduced to 325 for another 20.  I only wanted 12 muffins so they were on the large side.
Tender and flavorful and pretty healthy.

Delicious! I made adjustments to what I had on hand. I used walnuts instead of pecans and omitted the dates. I also subbed half of the flour for whole wheat flour and threw in a handful of oats. I left half of the apple in small chunks instead of shredding it all, so my muffins have a lot of texture and yummy apple bits inside. I also added half a teaspoon of allspice. Very nice recipe to use up what you have and sneak in veggies for the picky eaters in the house!

This is an excellent morning muffin. The only change I made was to use 1 tsp cinnamon, not two. I wanted the flavor of cinnamon but not to be overpowering. This is a bed and breakfast worthy recipe!! I used Granny Smiths and unsweetened coconut and pecans. Yum!!

Made as recipe directed, and these were very good.  A little labor intensive but worth it.  They were done in 14 minutes so set the timer for less time and check.  You can always bake longer, if need be.  Good recipe.

Made this for  my 3 kids--ages 2, 3, and 6--and they were a huge hit! Replaced coconut oil for the oil called for in the recipe and substituted a banana and  1/2 as much agave  nectar as recipe called for in sugar, plenty sweet and a bit healthier. Making the muffins for 2nd time this week to share at a brunch tomorro.w!

have just made them, I adjusted the recipe to 10 muffins, but made 6 large ones instead, I changed the ingredients a bit, I used 1/2 olive oil with 1/2 apple sauce, and 1/2 sugar v's 1/2 honey, and instead of the dates I used sultanas, and used grated almonds for the nuts. I didn't have a tooth pick to check they were ready, but got a tip off a website to use spaghetti. They turned out springy and moist, and tasty, I think for special occasions would like to top it with icing or something, but will deffo make this again:-)

These muffins are delicious! I did not have any coconut, and omitted the pecans. I also grated a medium zucchini, and added that to the mix--which added just enough moisture that I could use slightly less than 1/2-cup of vegetable oil. Per others' suggestions, I cut down sugar to only 3/4 cup. They turned out moist and delicious, and I can't wait to give one to my toddler!

Like many others, I made my own special changes.  I chopped up a very ripe mango that was hanging out in my fruit bowl, a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, 1/2 C. Dried cranberries, used 1/2 C. Whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 C. of white flour and used 1/2 C. Brown sugar in place of 1/2 C. Of the white.  OMG, Delish!  Like one of the other reviewers said, this is a great recipe for using up what's in your fruit bowl.  Next time I might try some applesauce or yougurt instead of oil to make it healthier.  But really perfection as is!  I made these to take on a road trip, but I doubt they will last long enough to make it to the car :-)

My son actually licked the muffin liner! The batter was very thick (I thought I had left something out) but it might have been because I chopped the apple rather than grating it. I agree that less than 1 cup of sugar is sufficient.

For overall taste and texture these were good! I must say though if you're using freshly grated carrots, strain first to remove excess water. When measuring the carrots, pack them in. If you've got a food processor you can get this done much faster. Blend first ingredients, pour into bowl, then process other ingredients and add to flour mixture. So much faster and less labor :-) These would be good with a frosting too.

I made these because I had a some dates to get rid of, and just happened to have the rest of the ingredients on hand, too.  These were good, but not spectacular.  I followed the recipe exactly, except didn't peel my apples (nor did I notice the peels once all chopped up!). Using a food processor makes these a lot quicker.  I grated everything first, then because it's such a course grate I put the apple and carrots in and pulse chopped it a few times.  To me these are really more like not as sweet carrot cake, and I prefer them with a very thin layer of cream cheese frosting.  I don't know how some people only got 12 muffins from this recipe.  I filled regular muffin cups 3/4 full with batter and got 21 muffins!  I do like recipes that use lots of fruits/veggies like this because my kids like these types of breads and otherwise wouldn't eat half the stuff in these.  My four year old ate 3 of these in one day and wanted more!  Also, these were better a day later, staying moist and seemed more flavorful.

Great muffins!  I didn't have any dates or raisins so I omitted them and I only used 3/4 cup of sugar because the coconut was sweetened.  They turned out perfectly delicious.

LOVED these.  I was looking for a good carrot muffin as my kids love them...this is it!!  I made all mini-muffins and froze half of them.  The next morning I had to defrost them because my kids had already eaten the first half.  I am going to double the recipe next time.  I did use a blender for the apples and carrots...much faster!!!

These muffins are absolutely delicious. I didn't have any dates or nuts but they turned out great anyways. They smelled so good while baking that I kept checking on them to get a whiff! Definately something I would make again.

Great!  We've decided we need 1/2 dz of these in the house at all times.  I omitted dates and used twice the nuts (walnuts rather than pecans).

Oh my, how delightfully good.  Quite the nice variety of flavors.  Very moist and not too sweet.

Delicious! We're counting calories and fat, so I omitted the vegetable oil and replaced it with an equal amount of plain yogurt (actually, it was probably about 3/4 cup yogurt, because I had to add more to get all the dry ingredients moistened).  Very moist.  I may try reducing the sugar a little next time to futher reduce the calories; they were not too sweet for us, but I think they'd still be sweet enough with a little less sugar.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe...I think a small can of pineapple, substituted for part of the carrots & apple, would improve this recipe even further!
