This was a great dip after adding a few personal touches, I used real bacon instead of imitation, and I added a pack of ranch dressing, and a tsp of ground red pepper to give it the edge it needed. Without adding extra stuff, it would have been okay, just a little bland. It was a total hit at our holiday party.

I've been making this for a while, and it is always a hit at parties.  I've known it as 'Potato Skin Dip', and my recipe has it layered:  sour cream spread on a plate, then the green onions, cheese & topped with bacon.  Then potato chips are used to 'scoop'through it--just another way to present this popular dip at a party!

This dip is so addictive!  Everyone just raved about it!  I did make the chages some suggested:  I added a packet of ranch dressing mix and I used real bacon.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Love this recipe!...took it to work, served with TownHouse crackers, we couldn't stay out of it. Same response with my family and with extended family who had it at the family Christmas get-together. It was also fantastic on baked potatoes. I did add cracked pepper and garlic powder to suit our tastes.

DELISH!!!!  Wow, this stuff is addicting!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added one envelope of ranch dressing mix.  I also gave it a pinch of black pepper too.  You have to serve this dip with potato chips to get that whole "loaded baked potato" taste.  I snipped some fresh chives on top for a bit of color.  My family couldn't stop eating this at Easter this year.  Thanks, BrendaTX, for a fabulous recipe!

This was a simple, tasty dip...best after letting it refridgerate for a few hours so the tastes can blend a little better.  I halved the recipe and I too used real crumbled bacon. I also added 2 TBLS of miracle whip (to take the "edge" off the sour cream and add some zip). Went well with chips and if I make baked potatoes within the next day or two (and if I still have any of this dip left), I see how well they do as a topper. Overall, pretty good and easy recipe. Thanks Brenda!

I used this to top off my baked potato, THEN ate it with chips.  Very good.  I might try a bit of adding ranch dressing mix with it next time, and use chives instead of scallions (personal preference).  Wish I had some now!!!

I was a little skeptical about this at first, because I thought that it would be bland. However, I brought this to a pig roast, and not only did it serve alot of people, it went over VERY well.  They LOVED it, it is awesome with chips, I'm sure it's even better on a baked potato!  Thanks Brenda!

This was a huge hit! I layered it in a baking pan, putting ranch powder in teh sour cream as many suggested as my first layer, followe by bacon bits (real bacon) and topped with cheddar cheese and then chives. I think this tasted best after sitting in the fridge for a couple hours before serving. Great with Ruffles!

Very good!  As other suggested, I added ranch dip mix.  I also think this is better if it's made at least 24 hours before serving -- it absorbs the flavors better.

This dip is ALWAYS a hit and there are never leftovers when I make it.  The men seem to really love it.  However, I add 1 ranch packet and real bacon. After mixing all the ingredients, I add cheese, bacon, and green onion on the top.  Looks just like an overstuffed bake potato.  Goes great with potato chips!  I am actually making it today and taking it to a BBQ.

This was good following others' suggestion to add a packet of ranch seasoning. I think it would have been pretty boring without some seasoning. If you don't have ranch, some garlic powder and pepper would at least be a good start. I cooked my own bacon and used a little less cheese, and it was a big hit! I'd gotten a store-bought dip as well in case people didn't like this one and the store dip was not touched at all.

I use light sour cream, double the bacon bits (use the soft ones...not those hard orange-colored ones), and I leave out the green onions b/c of personal preference.  SOOO easy and delicious!  Everyone always wants this recipe.  It's my quick go-to when I need to take something to a bbq/party.

Great appetizer dip to eat with potato chips or vegetables.  I like that it was easy to make and required very little effort and absolutely no preparation, because sometimes you don't have time to make anything too involved.

Excellent!! I added a ranch packet as others suggested and this dip was such a huge hit. Everyone at the party wanted the recipe. This recipe could easily be cut in half as it did make quite a large amount. This will be made again and again!

I added a good tablespoon of minced chives and I used really bacon, chopped, fried and drained.  At first the real bacon was a little too crisp, but after refrigerating for about two hours before our guests arrived it had softened up in the dip.  We liked this with Tostitos "Scoops" the best, although many used it for their potato chips.  This got rave reviews, but I couldn't help but think this would be great as a warm dip, with the cheddar sprinkled on top and melted instead of incorporated throughout.  At first I thought that texture was kind of weird, but I'm not taking any stars off because people really loved this!

As is, it's very bland because the sour cream is overwhelming the recipe. After tasting, I added garlic salt & onion powder. I also added a ton of scallions before the powders, but they didn't do much. I didn't want to use ranch dressing mix because it has a ton of MSG in it. I wish it was MSG-free because I just couldn't get the right mix of garlic & onion powders and salt. My husband enjoyed it, but he loves sour cream. Next time, I would add more bacon (I used homemade bacon bits). Guests at Thanksgiving left a lot on their plates and didn't mention it, so I'd say it was a bust!

Made as the recipe directs this is a 4 star recipe.  I read the other reviews that recommended adding additional seasonings.  I added dried dill, garlic powder and McCormick Garlic Pepper Seasoning to taste.  I took the recipe to a party and it was a big hit!

This was a good dip, not the best I ever had.  My suggestions, less sour cream, more cheese and more bacon bits, and real bacon bits.  I will keep this and maybe bake it next time.  Still looking for the to die for dip recipe.

Pretty good, but not a big hit.  Will make again.  It might be better with some diced sweet onion.

This was very different and my guest enjoyed it also. I only made half the recipe, but i used 1 pk of ranch dressing and it was wonderful.

For a bit more flavor, sauté half onion in stick of butter. Add One small container sour cream and one block cream cheese (room temp), bacon bits, shredded cheese, and green onion. Mix together and microwave for 5 minutes. Keep warm in crackpot.  I make this for my children's birthday parties, and it's always a favorite!

This was super easy to make! Everyone who tried it loved it. The only bad part about this was that even though I doubled it the whole thing was gone before I even got a chance to try it! I did alter slightly... I mixed the cheese and sour cream and layered the bacon and green onions on top.

Always a hit at every party I bring it to!  Only change I made was I used 1 pkg of fresh bacon cooked well and crumbled instead of the canned kind.

I have been making this recipe for about 12 years.  I always get rave reviews when people try it.  I only use one 16 oz container of sour cream, so that probably makes the flavors a little stronger.  It is best with the real bacon bits.  Make sure you refrigerate before serving.  So yummy with potato chips!

Really, REALLY good. Good shortcut topping for your baked potatoes or a dip for homemade steak fries. I like to add a bunch of chives and a little garlic powder. I serve this with both homemade bagel chips or homemade pita chips. NOTE: Now I add homemade dry ranch dressing mix and it's really good. Super addictive.

Do not hesitate to make this dip! Easy as can be and delicious. I would suggest however, making this a day ahead to let the flavor really develop. This is a big hit everywhere i take it.

Actually this should be 10 stars!!!  I made this (without testing it first) for a baked potato potluck at work.  It was inhaled and the next day people were looking for leftovers.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  What a winner!!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This dip was very good--took it to bowling for food night and very little came home with me.  I too added a packet of ranch dressing and also some drops of hot pepper sauce to give it some heat.

This was soooo easy to make.  I did add scallions to it as suggested by others, and I also added JALAPENO PEPPERS to the mix, to kick it up a notch.  I also used Ruffles Cheddar Cheese Flavored Potato chips.  This did was a BIG hit at the party we went to.

Very easy to make.  Recipe made a ton! Was good, something just seemed to be missing though.  Did add a bit of garlic powder and a little worcester sauce to zing it up a bit.  Next time I'll probably replace some of the sour cream with mayo to cut the richness a bit.

This was ok. This may just taste better on a baked potato and not as a dip for chips how i used it. It makes to much. I think if i make it again i will half all of the ingredients.

Yummers! Used 1 1/2 containers sour cream (what I had on hand at the time) and will do the 2 containers next time. Pretty thick and all my chips were breaking. Silly me. Still was AWESOME! Even my 7 yr old who does not like onions chowed on this! :)  Used the real bacon bits.  This one is a keeper. Super easy and addicting! :)
Thank you for sharing this Brenda!

Great recipe! I made a few changes for our personal tastes but you just can't go wrong with this. I used a pound of slab bacon, fresh grated chedder (much better than pre-packaged), and 1 pkg ranch mix. I also added just a few teaspoons of horseradish for a little kick. I think the reviewers who didn't like this did not let it sit long enough -- definitely needs to sit several hours or overnight for the flavors to blend. Thanks Brenda!

I used one container sour cream (Daisy light), and crumbled bacon strips instead of bacon bits. Everyone at work ate this up! I was disappointed that none was left over because I wanted to try it on baked potatoes! I will just have to make more...Thanks!!

I would not make this dip again.  I took it to a Superbowl party.  People took one bite, and no more.  My dip was the least popular. Reviewers that said this tastes like sour cream are correct. I only used 16oz. of sour cream (1/2 of what the recipe calls for) and real bacon.  The dip still only tasted like sour cream.  After about 3 hours, the flavors began to mix, but this is a potato topper not a dip!!

Wow! I can't believe how quick and easy this was! I decided to make it about 10 minutes before company arrived, and it really did only take 5 minutes! I added extra cheese. My guests loved it and wanted the recipe. I'll defintely be making this again. Thank you!
(By the way, I halved the recipe and still had plenty).

I made this dip for St. Patty's Day and it was a big hit.  I substituted 1/4 bunch of scallions for the green onions and used Sharp Cheddar.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Blah! Blah!Blah! This may be good on top of a baked potato but was definately lacking as a dip. Tasted mainly of sour cream, tried putting in the blender in hopes that the flavors would mix better. Bacon bits are now like grains of sand. Will have to come up with a new recipe quick for a party...this ones going in the trash.

A taste sensation! All of the different flavors combine to form one delicious dip! Next time, I would like to add some extra bacon bits and try using some extra sharp cheddar cheese. Yummy! The bowl was scraped clean.

I made this to serve with Chips and Pretzels…it dissappeared! I substituted Dried Chives for the Green onion cause not eveyone likes onions. It not only looked beautiful, it was so tasty…I also got the real bacon, bacon bits and added more than it said. This would be great with other cheeses as well!

This was ok.  Be careful of too much bacon or it can be too salty.  I like it served with veggies better than potato chips.  I've tried it with a half package of ranch dressing dip as some have suggested, but be careful of adding too much or you lose the baked potato type taste.

I recently made this dip for a party, and it was a HUGE hit! It disappeared fast, and everyone asked for the recipe. I did make the modification suggested by other reviewers, and added an envelope of ranch dressing mix. I also used real bacon bits. I was just asked to make it for another party, and this time I made my own, fresh bacon bits, and added a little minced garlic. I'll let you know how that goes over....

I, like some reviewers, used real bacon in place of the bacon bits. I used about 12 strips of bacon and chopped them up. I also added about 1.5 tablespoons of mayonnaise, and used fat free sour cream. My mom, who is a very picky eater, loved it!

I made a huge batch of this for a house party, the bowl was practically licked clean by the end of the night. This recipe is simple and very tasty. I would recommend using real bacon. I just threw it all in the oven and then crumbled it after it was nice and crispy. I will be making this again for sure.

I thought it was a little bland so I added some seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little chili powder.  Good dip with those additions.

This was the first time I made it. Mother's Day '08. It was gone in a flash.  I halved it.  Next time will make a full recipe.  Also  a good idea to have on hand allthe time for baked potatoes.

AMAZING...  I've never made something that I got so many compliments on and people asking "Did you make that dip again?!?!"  It is so easy.  I only use 1 sour cream, but learned if you don't use 1/2 of the rest of the ingredients it becomes too thick and the chips break.

My only suggestion is listening to a previous review and make it the night before and letting the flavours mix together.  I served it with chips... I'm dying to try it on a baked potato!

This dip is the best!  I found it on this site 3 years ago and always get requests to bring it to parties.  It's become a staple for me to make and everyone loves it.  Really fast and easy to prepare too.  Great recipe!

This became our summer dip.  I took it everywhere and never had any leftover.  I love recipes with under 10 ingredients.  When I first read the recipe I thought it seemed like it would be bland, but it actually tastes incredible on a potato chip.

I love this dip!  I served it warm from the crock pot with those Potato Skin chips.  I think they are the TGI Fridays brand. Wonderful!

I felt like a serious goddess last night at the pool party we went to, thanks to this recipe.  Everybody raved about it and everybody asked for the recipe. I added just a little bit of ranch dressing powder mix for extra flavor. Will be making again and again for sure.

Had to update my review because I've made this several times over the past couple years, and I find it to be a Five-Star recipe with the following changes:  reduce the green onions to 2 or 3 rather than an entire bunch and add a packet of the powdered ranch dressing mix.  Raves every time, and people keep eating it until it's gone, usually very early in a party.  Can't be beat!

Delicious! I've made this a few times and found it definitely tastes best when ranch mix is added and with real bacon.

I made this for a meeting, and everybody loved it.  I made it again later with stuff I had on hand and I had to use Sharp cheddar.  It's definitely better with mild.  My husband also thought that it needed a little salt.  It's the best after it sets overnight.

Add this to cubed cut frozen hash browns and bake.
I did add the ranch dressing mix and used real bacon, but was not impressed with it at all as a chip dip. It does go very well with potatoes, so I added it to a package of frozen hash browns and half a can of cream of chicken soup. Bake for about 45 min at 350. I was brave and took this new recipe to a pot luck. I went home with an eempty dish and many request for the recipe

This stuff is addictive!!  I am always asked to bring this to parties. There is never any left! The only thing that I change is that I use the real bacon bits, instead of the imitation ones! Thanks for the recipe.

This is the easiest dip to make and so tasty.  I added Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix and it made it taste SO good.  I brought it to a work party with chips, but I am REALLY excited about trying it on potatoes this week.  It's a keeper - I wish I had found it a loooooooooooooooong time ago.  I serve baked potatoes ALL the time and this will be a good recipe to have on hand.  It's easily altered as well.  YUMMY!

Very good and so very easy.  I don't care for the onion soup mix type of chip dip.  When crunched for time, I usually just pick up some French Onion dip at the grocery.  But, this is so much better, and doesn't take any real prep.  Our small gathering devoured it.

This dip is awesome!  i did only use 1 container of sour cream, but the same amount of cheese and 8 slices of crumbled bacon.  We enough left over to try on baked potatoes.  I did add the ranch mix, as that sounded like a yummy addition.  I will be making this again and again!

Very good!  Definitely use real bacon pieces, and let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours to let the flavors blend.  This makes a TON of dip, so I will halve the recipe for smaller gatherings.

Excellent dip!!!  I served it with Christmas lunch and everyone ate it.  If six kids, ages 13 to 1, will eat it, you know it's great.  The leftovers, along with the recipe,  went home with my mom because she liked it so much.

Yummy!  Hit of the party.  An easy recipe that can be made well in advance.  Be sure to have a couple bags of potato chips on hand.  I ran out of chips but saved the leftovers for baked potatoes the next night!

I made this for a family party and it was gone before I could turn around.  Everyone loved it.  It was so easy to make.  I had made a little extra and put it on bake potatoes the next day.  This was also very good.  Thank You!!

I did not like this recipe too much.  I made it for a party, and everyone tasted once, but that's it!!  It was not a hit - it was way to mushy, and the green onion flavor got stronger as it sat...

Ugh, I don't know why everyone liked this bland and boring dip.  It's a throwback (and throw away) recipe from the 1960s.  I have never thought of myself as a food snob, but my tastes are a bit more sophisticated than this dip.  Way too sour-creamy, and I now know why I never use bacon bits in a jar, even if they are real.  I'm glad I halved the recipe--I won't have as much to throw out.

Very Good Dip!  The clerk at the grocery forgot to pack my green onions so I used dried minced onions & chives and it was still yummy!  No complaints here!

WOW!  SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!  I made this for my parents anniversary party and it was a big hit.  It is just too tasty for words.  I made it the night before and it really melded the flavors together.  I can't wait to try it on hot baked potatoes!

I made this dip this summer for a get together and it has become one of the most requested recipes I've ever had.  My uncle said it was the perfect summer dip (but it's great year round!!) I brought it to a Halloween party for English-as-Second language students, I wasn't sure if they would like it but they scraped the bowl clean!!! I'll make this anytime I have a party, it's a big hit.  And I'm not sure it needs anything added to it, it has a lot of flavor as is.....try it!

Absolutely delicious!  I had first cut the recipe in 1/2 but after I tasted it, decided to make all of it.  We had to stop ourselves from eating it before the guests arrived.

I made this for our office party and it was great!  Luckily I thought to print out 
the recipe to take to work with me, because I had several requests for it.  I made 
one change-- I added another container of sour cream as it seemed a bit 
overwhelming with just the two containers called for-- next time I'll probably 
reduce the amount of onion.  It DID make a lot, but this way I had some for my
family AND enough for work, and what I took for work disappeared completely!

This is great - both as a dip and as a baked potato topper.  I thought it was better after it sat overnight.

I made it for 'Dip Day' atwork and everyone loved it! Had to get copies of the recipe to give out.  I am not handy in the kitchen so this recipe is perfect. It literally takes 5 minutes to make. I took the suggestion and got potato chips. I would love to try it on baked potatoes next.

I do wish I'd listened to the other reviewers and added a packet of ranch powder or some seasonings. This tasted fine, but was a little bit bland.

I followed advice from other reviews and added ranch seasoning which I think makes it more tasty. I think the ratio of sour cream to other ingredients was little too much. I served this at a NYE party with waffle fries. People really enjoyed it! I plan to use the leftover dip on baked potatoes tomorrow. I will make this recipe again with less sour cream.

As written this recipe is okay. A bit bland & my friends did not care for the imitation bacon. After making this a few times I decided to change the recipe which I will post as loaded baked potato dip. I always serve this dip with waffle fries. A excellent choice for this dip.

I made this according to the recipe. Luckily, I let it sit before serving. Tasting it I realized that it definitely needed some work. The sour cream flavor was so overwhelming you could barely taste the other flavors. So believe those who say it needs some seasoning. Because I had guests on the way I took the easy route with the Ranch dip mix others suggested.  That saved it although it still wasn't the best thing I've ever had.

This was such a hit at hubby's birthday party!  Entire bowl was gobbled up in no time flat.  I would agree with other reviewers in possibly adding a ranch type seasoning for additional flavor.  I added a bit of chopped white onion as well.  MUST use the real bacon!!  Bacon bits would be icky.

I serve this with the wavy style potato chips and people love it.  You need a "hefty" potato chip for these, the dip is really thick but great!

I make it with one sour cream and one block of cream cheese.  Then I bake it about 20 minutes and serve warm with bread chunks and veggies slices.

This dip was pretty good, but I felt that it could have used less cheese, and maybe a little bit more bacon. I used real bacon, and chives instead of the green onions. I also added some ranch dressing mix for flavor. Altogether it is a good dip with these changes, but not one that I would rave about. Thanks!

Yummy! Easy! Used real bacon (Done in oven=no mess).  Mixed all ingrediants as directed, and garnished top with a little cheese, green onion, and bacon crumbles. Served with rippled potato chips at Super Bowl Party.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it for a party at work.  It was the first thing to go.  I got many, many compliments.  I took the suggestion to layer the ingredients instead of mixing them all together.  I will be making this again.

This was delcious! I used light sour cream and a 4.3 ounce package crumbled bacon, otherwise everything was done as written. Served with potato chips. Does not need ranch seasoning as others have suggested, it has plenty of flavor on its own. I would suggest reserving a little bacon/cheese/green onions to sprinkle on top of the dip to make it a little more appealing, otherwise layering the sour cream/green onion mixture, topped with bacon and then cheese would be a nice presentation as well.

Great quick dip!  I added some seasoned salt and onion powder.  We wanted some "kick" so added in some cayenne pepper and Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe on this site about 3 years ago...I have been making it ever since...it is always a big hit at parties and is so easy to make..you just need to let it sit and blend for several hours before you eat it.  We also love it on baked taters...:)

This is excellent as written for a baked potato topper, but I agree with adding a ranch packet if using as a dip. Thanks for the post here.

SO GOOD!  I made this dip for a party, and halved it, because everytime I've attended a party with dip there has been a ton left over.  NOT WITH THIS ONE!  Initially it went untouched.  Then someone must have been brave enough to try it, because suddenly everyone was crowded around it, and the bowl was pretty much licked clean.  I got compliments from everyone!  I did add some ranch dressing mix.  YUM!

This turned out very well.  I took the advice of others and added 1 pkg of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix, used real bacon bits, used the fancy shredded cheddar cheese and added about 1/4 cup of light Miracle Whip. I used 1 container of regular sour cream and 1 container of light sour cream.  Next time I might chop up a roma tomato or two and throw that in as well!

Good!  I can't imagine dipping my chips in this though.  Excellent on baked potatoes though.  They're hot, so the cheese melts & is so good :)

This was a yummy chip dip with a few modifications. As much as I LOVE loads of sour cream on stuff...like baked potatoes, I can't imagine just dipping my chips in it. Most chip dips are sour cream/mayo combos so I added almost an equal amount of Miracle Whip. I used real bacon and (dried) chives instead of green onions. Good with Baked Ruffles, Townhouse/Ritz crackers, and if you experience chip-breakage, get those Kettle Baked Chips, as they are thicker and more "durable!"

Okay, me again.  My party just ended and the dip was a huge hit.  Not a spoonful left when all was said and done.  Everyone loved it.  I think making it well in advance and chilling it for a long time makes a difference.  I garnished it with cheese, bacon, and onions, so it was pretty.

I thought the dip was good, but needed a little more zip for my taste (and I even added a teaspoon of spicy horseradish!)  I cut the recipe in half for a party of 20 - I only used 1 container of sour cream, but a little more than half of the other ingredients.  I served the dip with Ruffles chips, but they kept breaking.  It's a pretty thick dip so I would recommend a sturdy cracker.  There were leftovers so I don't know if the recipe wasn't received well, if people got frustrated with the chips breaking, or if there was just too much other stuff to eat.

Yummy! I only liked this with potato chips, although a friend said to try with Fritos.  Definatly a baked potato topping. This dip was difficult to dip chips into, maybe needed more sour cream?

Thank you for this awesome recipe!  It was a hit at our Christmas Eve lunch.  I used dried minced onions instead of fresh (purely for personal reasons :-) and added a package of Hidden Valley Ranch dry dressing mix.  I'm pretty sure everyone at the party left with a copy of the recipe and my husband thinks I'm the best!  Thanks again!!!

This dip was great!  I made it the night before and also added an envelope of Ranch Salad Dressing Mix.  It was a big hit at my party.  We used the remaining dip on baked potatoes the next day!

I thought it was good. It needs to be a little heavier on the sour cream to onions though.

Excellent and easy.  I followed other recommendations to use ranch dressing mix and real bacon bits.  It was creamy and tangy with a smoky flavor.

It is good but I put the ranch dressing in it and it made it much to salty.  I will only use half a packet next time.

Planned on taking this to a family party this weekend, made some this afternoon for husband's football game (to test it).  He couldn't even wait to eat it so he put it all over mashed potatos at dinner.  It was super!  Great with chips too.  I added some horseradish as suggested for a kick and it is out of this world!

Excellent.  I made half a batch but used real bacon and more of it (about 7 slices, cooked and crumbled).  Yummy!

I wish I could give this more than five stars!  My family DEVOURED this dip!  In fact, I have to make it at least twice a week for them to be happy!  We use fat-free sour cream, which tastes just as good, but we cancel that out by using real bacon, that I have to "bit" by hand. :)  And Spice Island chives, rather than fresh - gives it kind of a different taste, but still just as great!  Another good tip is to let it sit for at least 20min. in the fridge after it's all stirred together - just so the flavors have a chance to mix and soak into the sour cream!
