Loved this recipe.  The only change I made was adding 1/2 - 3/4 cup of sour cream to the meat mixture.  It made it creamy and yummy.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Pretty darn good!  I used regular salsa instead of picante because that's all we had and even my picky 6-yr old who won't touch anything spicy loved it.  Was a nice mix of sweet and tangy with the cornbread and the salsa mix.  Everyone cleared their plate and went for seconds.  It was very good.

This was great comfort food on a cold night, it really warmed us up and "hit the spot" as we say here in Texas.  I don't agree the comment at the beginning of this recipe that it would go well with with a grilling menu or to take on a picnic.  I had to substitute diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce, but it still came out great.  I also added a chopped onion to the meat as it was cooking.  This dish was substantial, filling, and had a zesty taste that totally obscured the fact that it was 'plain old' ground beef. Even my kids liked it. You could even add more shredded cheese if you are a cheese person.  You should try it.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this for a qiuck supper and it was wonderful.I doubled the recipe and my family at every last bite. Next time I may add cheese to the cornbread mix and maybe some onions and peppers to the hamnurger. Overall an excellent and fast supper.

This was quick and tasty.  I read the other reviews which were very helpful.  I reduced the tomato sauce  and also used salsa.  1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 cup salsa. Make sure you use a good cornbread mix.  I was disappointed in the new one I tried.  Anyone have a good corn bread mix?

Good though unfortunately my husband wasn't too excited about it.  It reminded me a little of Mexican Shepherd's Pie (also from allrecipes).  I added minced garlic, minced onion, seasoning salt and a dash of red pepper flakes to the meat.  I used salsa instead of picante sauce and sprinkled the top with additional cheese during the last five minutes of baking.

My family absolutely loves it. The only thing I do is add a little more of the picante sauce than what is called for. Other than that, it is an awesome recipe.

I made this for my husband and he said: I will eat this again.  The corn bread was fluffy and helped not make the dish so heavy on your stomach.  I don't like many ground beef meals and surprisingly, I liked this one. I used Rotel instead of salsa because I was out and it worked great.  To tame down the heat I added sour cream. I will be adding more cheese nest time, overall great comfort food recipe.

This was ok. My kids liked it, but Dad and I were a little "meh" about it. One box of jiffy mix doesn't make enough batter to cover an 8x8 pan, so the bread part was very thin.

I made this with a couple of modifications.  

I used salsa instead of the picante sauce since that's what I had on hand.  I also added a can of black beans to the base, which made it heartier.  It'd be really yummy with olives, too, I just didn't take the time to cut up my whole black olives and put them in.

I didn't add any cheese since I'm non-dairy, although I am sure that would have been yummy.

Instead of the corn muffin mix, I used a gluten-free cornbread recipe and put that on top.  It took a little longer to cook but was really yummy!

I was not really a fan of this recipe. It had too much of a tomato flavor for my taste. The cornbread dried out and it was not good.

Delicious! I added some hot spicy powder my friends uncle makes to the hamburger to add some spice and also some minced garlic and onion.  I used a can of mixed veggies and a can of tomato paste since I didnt have the sauce. I also used my homemade salsa and some colby jack cheese I had leftover, and added a bit more pepper and some salt before putting it in the pan. It was very filling and my fiance loved it! thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! I, too, used salsa (I actually couldn't find picante sauce anywhere in the grocery store), and it came out great. I'm definitely going to put this into rotation among my regularly-made recipes.

Didn't have salsa. Used ketchup and blue cheese dressing instead.  Never seen my boyfriend eat 1lb of beef so fast. The whole thing went in one sitting. At least he let me taste it. Delicious!

We LOVE this casserole, it is a staple in my dinner rotation.  I tweak it for some family preferences (less cheese for hubby's dairy problems, cream corn to temper the acidity for my heartburn, and ground turkey for overall healthiness), but the changes are minor.  I try to keep the ingredients on hand in case hubby has a bad day at work, then I throw this together and it always helps to lift his spirits when he's feeling down.

Dish was a hit with my family. My only change was to put a layer of cornbread on the bottom and the top.

I tasted the meat mixture & it was bland. So I added salt, pepper, onion & garlic. Didn't have picante sauce so I added 1 can of Rotel mild tomatoes & 1 can of black beans. I sprinkled the cheese over the mixtue, then topped with the cornbread. I must say it turned out pretty good. With the adjustments I made I would make it again.

My family enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe and added 1 can of kidney beans too. It turned out great.

My family loves this.  I use the cornbread recipe that is on the cornmeal container and it works great!  It's a great go-to recipe when prep time is short.

DH loved this meal!  I used salsa instead of picante and we used the whole bag of cheddar.  I think this would be good with chicken, too.  Next time I will double the cornbread mixture on top and saute an onion with the ground beef.  Easy, tasty and filling - thanks!

This is really easy to make and kid friendly! I really enjoyed the sweet contrast to the dish that the cornbread provided. It is very filling! I used salsa instead of Pace as well, I also added more cheese. I will definitely make this again!
