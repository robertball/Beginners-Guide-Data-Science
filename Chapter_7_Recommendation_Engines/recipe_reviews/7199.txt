I mixed this up and tossed it with penne rigati(no calzone dough).  The kids couldn't wait for me to bake it in the oven, and loved the taste test, so I served it just so.  It was delicious!  Very traditional Italian flavor.

This was ok, but nothing outstanding. A bit of a waste of prosciutto really. I doubt I'll make it again. Thanks anyway.

This is a nice change from the tomato-based fillings typically used with a calzone. The outcome was a bit runny and had me worried that it would run out everywhere, which it didn't. I didn't mix the prosciutto in the filling but just folded a piece on top before closing the dough. I used basil instead of parsley. Thank you for the recipe.
