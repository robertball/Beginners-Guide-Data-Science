This is excellent. I'm not sure why it calls for 6 T of olive oil divided because the other 3 T don't show up anywhere else in the recipe. Neither does the nutritional yeast that I bought specifically for this recipe. I was so focused on following the recipe, that I didn't put it in because it wasn't listed in the directions. I didn't have any unsweetened cocoa, so it got left out but I can see how it would add even more depth to the taste. Poblano chilis weren't available, so I used Anaheim instead. I cooked it for about 9.5 hours overnight, unplugged it in the morning to cool, and refrigerated until it was lunch time. Would be great with some non-dairy sour cream. Well worth all the chopping.

Delicious! We used 2 cups of Gardien beef less ground for the TVP. Also, because people in the house like to decrease the hot spice, we only used one orange pepper rather than the peppers recommend. Decreased the vinegar to 1/2 c and also halved quantities of spices except for soy and Worcester sauce. We added 3/4 recommended amount for cocoa.
Cooked it for 4 hours on the stovetop. Very flavorful. I think meat lovers would agree that it is a crowd pleaser for everyone.
This is now the “go to” chili recipe.

This is amazing vegetarian chili, with great depth of flavor. I am not usually a vegetarian chili fan and have tried numerous recipes in the past. This is BY FAR the best!

Family of vegetarians loved it!  
Didn't use Worcestershire sauce - not vegetarian.
Didn't use  (didn't have) nutritional yeast and liquid smoke.

Thanks - this is a keeper!
