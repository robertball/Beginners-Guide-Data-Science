Oh yay! We loved this chimichurri:) Even my husband liked it which is a HUGE thumbs up. Served it with steaks ribeyes and NY strips. I also dipped my roasted sweet potatoes in it so dang good. 5 stars from me!

This was really good and could be used on many different things. I am going to use of the leftover tonight on my scrambled eggs. I do feel it could use a little heat but that is an easy fix and the only thing I will change next time.
