This is a great recipe, but I made a few adjustments.  I used elbow macaroni, 1 8oz. can of peas (will use fresh next time), and after I mixed all the ingredients together I put the mixture into a 2 quart greased casserole dish, topped with a half cup shredded cheese and then sprinkled with 16 crushed saltines mixed with 3 tablespoons melted butter.  Finally, the casserole is baked at 350 until bubbling and toasted on top (about 25 minutes).  It was great, but next time I might use only 6 oz. (one can) of tuna.  This is a very versatile recipe that is good and cheezy just how I like it!  Would be great with a little hot sauce! Oh yeah, my cheese sauce turned out smooth (except for the lumps from the cottage cheese), but I do recommend melting at low heat!  Medium heat started to burn my shredded cheese.

How to make a cheese sauce:  Lower the heat, stir constantly, and have a ton of patience.  When you think it's done, keep stirring it.  And stirring it.  And stirring it.  It will feel like it's taking forever.  But it will get smooth with lots of stirring, patience and medium low heat.

It's a cold, snowy day and we were kept home from work becuase of the weather. So instead of the cold sandwiches we normally take with us, we decided to have a hot lunch. I was in the mood for tuna but hubby wanted mac and cheese. This sounded like a combo of the two so I thought I would give it a try. I did make a couple of substitutions based on personal taste. I used only 1/2 the butter and sauted some onions in it before making the sauce. I also left out the cottage cheese, instead using more milk. And I added some garlic powder. This was tasty and very satisfying after a morning of shoveling snow. I will make it again. Btw... some mentioned that the cheddar didn't melt well. Try Kraft Four Cheese Melt in the grated cheese section. It works beautifully in any recipe like this.

I used the shredded cheddar and the sauce was clumpy.  I tried it again with Velveeta, which was very rich, but definitely made a better sauce.  ABout 1/2-3/4lb Velveeta instead of cheddar is my recommendation.  Not a bad recipe overall.

I'd give this 5 stars, but of course I changed it a bit. Instead of using cottage cheese, which I generally find to be bitter and difficult to cook with, I substituted an equal amount of cream cheese (This alleviates the "lumpiness" as well). I also added an extra tablespoon of sour cream. I added some chopped, crisp cooked bacon and substituted about half of the regular cheddar with smoked cheddar from the cheese case at the market. It turned it into a special, "gourmet" tuna mac.

This was very good but a little different. The cheese didn't want to stick to the noodles - just to the tuna and peas. The taste was very good though.

Very good!  I had to work with what I had available so I ended up using penne pasta, shredded mozzarella cheese, and cream cheese instead of the sour cream and cottage cheese.  Still delish!

I have now made this recipe a bunch of times.  It is our standard Mac & Cheese recipe.  I rarely add the tuna though. I use whole wheat macaroni noodles and also add a couple dashes of Woresteshire.  Lastly after putting it together, I pop it in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350.  When we are feeling extra extravagant with this, we put french fried onions on top for the last 5 mintues.

Very good, with the following changes: made a roux with the butter and flour and added 3/4 c milk then added the cheese and sour cream.  Changed cottage cheese for a chunk of cream cheese - sauce came out very thick and smooth. Used elbows because that's what I had.  Didn't have peas - would have been even better with them.  Very good base recipe to fiddle around with.

We liked this, but we needed to add some heat for our tastes. Added some salt, pepper and chili pepper.

This is a great recipe, originally tried it because I didn't have any condensed soup and wanted to try something different in my Tuna casserole. Excellent taste, my husband loved it! Said not to make it the other way anymore. I even omitted the sour cream, just because I didn't happen to have it. Still tasted great.

This was great!!  I used velveeta cheese,and a few extra spices, but everyone loved it, it was a bit cheesy, which I personally loved, but some may not like quite as much as we did.

This is so good!  I used sliced, roasted turkey tenderloin instead of tuna and it was fantastic!  The only problem was that it sat in my stomach like a rock.  Very rich.

Good base recipe, there's lots of room for your own touches. I added some roasted garlic, used Velveeta and left out the milk/butter. Cottage cheese took forever to melt, but once it does the flavor is really tasty. Hubby thought it was ok.

I did not like this recipe for several reasons.  It had a bitter taste to it and the cheese was very clumpy.  It may be better with some of the recommendations by some of the other reviewers.
