I really enjoyed this dish a lot. I liked the flavors of the oregano and the cumin, they really came through and gave this an earthy spicy taste. I used dried minced onion since it was quick and the onions at the store look pitiful (about a heaping T worth for each onion). I used whole mexican oregano, and for the salt I used 1/2 tsp of hot salt in the meatballs and 1/2 tsp hot salt in the sauce. I did add about a half cup of water and simmered this covered about an hour total. I didn't care for the rice on it's own, but it went very well as a base for meatballs and sauce. I could have used half the can of mexicorn though as it seemed way too much. My son ate this wrapped in a flour tortilla. My husband didn't like this at all and wouldn't even try the rice, but he doesn't like his meat with anything tomatoey. Thanks for sharing this, it was really good.

I'm sorry to write this.  Avoid it at all costs!!!  Saved it, made it, we could not eat it.  Hubby said it was the worst thing he's tasted from AR.  We made this as written.

This was an excellent dinner but I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used frozen meatballs and made the tomato sauce to heat them in for about 25 minutes.  I used chipotle chili powder, which turned out fantastic, and left out the vinegar.  I also made my own favorite Mexican rice recipe and didn't add any corn to it.  The whole family loved it!

I made this according to directions except that I used pre-made frozen meatballs, and I threw everything but the corn & rice in the slow cooker and put it on low all day. Threw in corn half hour before serving, everyone including the 3 year old went back for seconds!

My search was for a meatball with no egg and no bread crumbs.  I was glad to find one.  But the recipe is not really Mexican. The sauce is sweet and sour.  Vinegar and brown sugar equals sweet/sour. So, instead, I used tomato sauce and Mexican spices as suggested, but increased the amounts and added more garlic too.   I rated the recipe 4 stars because the meatball was what I wanted and the sauce was easy to change to my taste.  One star off because the name of the recipe is misleading.
