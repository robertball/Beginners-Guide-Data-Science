Beautiful, sweet, and fluffy coffee meringue frosting. The brown sugar gives it a lovely caramel color. It nicely complemented the dark, rich chocolate cake I made. Use the same day and refrigerate leftovers (if there are any).

Even though I didn't have a double boiler, I was able to make one with a pan and a bowl.  The frosting was light and fluffy.  I used a German Chocolate coffee.  Not bad.

I love the flavor! I use this frosting on chocolate cupcakes. I wish it held its shape a bit better, but the fluffy texture is so fun.

This made lots of frosting.  I covered a layer cake (not between layers mind you) and there is probably enough left to cover another!

I originally made this as cupcake frosting but it turned out too sweet and soft. Though I discovered that if you put it in the fridge after, it does sort of retain it's shape and develops a thin outer crust. 

Since it was too sweet, I ended up using only half of the recipe. Luckily, I also made a chocolate cake which was originally just a 1 layer cake with cream cheese frosting. So I decided to cut the cake in layers and used this in between the layers of chocolate cake and added some chopped nuts. Worked well too.
