I did not find this cake rich at all. I was a little hesitant to make it when I noticed it called for oil and not eggs. It tasted oily. But it was very easy make.

This recipe is FABULOUS with a couple of modifications. I add 1 c. of sour cream 1 c. of chocolate chips make the coffee extra strong and reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 c. I only bake it for 40 min. (just until the toothpick comes out clean.) It also comes out beautifully in a ring pan. This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe.

Even though I normally don't look at the reviews before making a recipe. I did in this case. However I followed it to a T as written and made 2 small 6 inch cakes and more then a dozen cupcakes. And here's what I can say about it. 1 if you can't have eggs. This would be an excellent alternative for that fact. However my cake did raise my cake was rich moist and dense but still slightly light. It did have a harder texture on the top of the cake because of the sugar. Not bad but it was there as well as a slight after taste. I could handle it it was due to the coffee. While my kids totally said it was awesome with the chocolate fudge frosting I used. And it quite complaimented the flavor of the cake. I didn't think the aftertaste of the cake was bad. Slightly off the norm but it was fine however depending on the flavor of the coffee you use will create that back taste so to speak. Either reduce the amount of the vanilla or the strength of the coffee. But I did like the cake over all. What I didn't like is that fact of when handling with your hands from pan to cake board the cake was very sticky to the touch especially on the bottom even though a tooth pick test showed the cake was done. I can and will make again. Please note sift your dry ingredients well & mix your wet ingredients thoroughly before mixing together but mix all together just until combined. That is the key. And moniter the baking time mine didn't take as long when baking in small pans or cupcakes.

my family just loves this cake but i did a few changes...i added 3 eggs and made the coffee strong then poured the coffee over ice to cool it so it wont "cook" the eggs when mixing turned out very rich and great tasting.

Maybe I did something wrong here but mine came out very light. Though it did not taste bad I did feel a little let down. I was expecting it to be much more rich.

Oh my chocolate goddess! I used canola oil instead because that's all I buy. I made these for my sons school...well for the staff. I couldn't stop eating them and they didn't get that many. I made my own chocolate marshmallow frosting and chocolate fondant to top them. And I'm making them again today. Thank you!

Instead of coco I added melted chocolate bar. The coffee really helps.
