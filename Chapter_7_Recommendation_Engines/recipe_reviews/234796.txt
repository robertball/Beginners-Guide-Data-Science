These were so delicious! My family loved them. The only thing I did differently was that I used M&M's instead of dark chocolate. Next time I will use the dark chocolate because they will stick together better. The taste of the coconut oil and the peanut butter together is magical!

I cook for a person with no appetite due to side effects of medicine. It is a challenge to get antioxidants down him because his tastebuds prefer sweet stuff. So beets, kale etc "taste like dirt". He could eat oatmeal raisin or peanut butter cookies for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but that's too much sugar and anyway it's summer now and the oven makes the house too hot. So, short story long, I am delighted to find this recipe and will make it as soon as I have all the ingredients. Just had to comment that I've been looking for a bar cookie/candy style recipe that calls for local honey (against seasonal allergies), nutrient-dense things like almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, prunes, raisins, dried cherries, blueberries, etc. that are bound together with peanut butter or chocolate but contain no butter and eggs so the cookies don't need refrigeration. And doesn't heat up the house in summer. Thank you!

Amazing for any thing, but I love to make this when I'm taking my siblings out on a hike or to a picnic or park. It is a quick non messy snack that tastes delish!!

This didn't turn out like the picture at all; it's just as yummy though! I saved 1/4 cup of the chips to add on top as another reviewer recommended. The same could be done with the nuts, although I'd add versus save a portion.  Mis en place is definitely recommended for this recipe since I was afraid I'd burn the pb-honey-coconut oil mixture. However, it wasn't too sticky at all! I used pecans and reduced sugar craisins b/c they were both on sale. I had all the other ingredients on hand. Definitely needed to chill the dish for more than an hour. The freezer firmed these up perfectly. Rich flavor and great alternative to junk food candy!

I also must give this recipe 5 stars. It tastes like a peanut butter cup to me! I love that you can easily make this recipe organic and can control the quality by the ingredients used. I mixed is raw walnuts and raw pumpkin seeds. One change I made was NOT to mix in the chocolate chips until they melted. I waited until the last second to stir them in and then transferred the mixture into a pan. I wanted to bite into cool chocolate chunks when eating these bars!
