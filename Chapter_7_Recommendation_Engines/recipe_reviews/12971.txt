Here's a tip from my mom. If you are going to use a ham bone for flaver, cook the ham bone in water & make the stock first. Then use it instead of cooking it all together. It will give a lot more room in the pot for veggies & it is a lot easier to remove bone & bits from stock then it is when its in the soup.

With changes below, this warrants five stars.

Okay, I am NOT a purist and use whatever tastes best.  White Northern beans I find a little boring, so I used a bulk foods 13 bean mix, which had split peas, lentils, pinto, black, black eyed peas, garbanzo and several other types INCLUDING White Northern.  This bean mix is cheaper, especially in bulk, and possesses a much more complex flavor than just white beans alone.

Second, in the six cups of water I used  half chicken broth and half vegetable broth (both Better than Boullion) so that the flavors better complimented the vegetable mix in the soup.

Cayenne pepper instead of black, to go with the smoky flavor of half a pack of bacon (as opposed to straight ham, it was all I had on hand).

I added 1 teaspoon celery seed to go with the celery stalks, plus three large carrots.  Also, though I had diced tomatoes on hand I figured hand-chopped Roma would add more flavor and better texture.


The beans were soaked overnight, so the soup only needs three hours on high in the crock pot to combine and reduce properly.  Served with homemade cornbread it was PHENOMENAL!  One of the best bean soups I have had, with the tweaks.  Perhaps it is not Navy Bean anymore, but I think the taste is quite a lot better.

This soup is a keeper. I put all the ingredients except the tomatoes, salt, & pepper in a crockpot before leaving for work. Since the ham and bone were cold, I dissolved the bullion cube in boiling water and poured it over the ingredients. I added the tomatoes and pepper when I got home (the ham dded enough salt to the soup) and it was ready to eat.

Can I give this 6 stars??? Made it yesterday, but goofed and bought 2 ham hocks instead of the ham.  Threw everything in my stockpot but used chicken broth instead of water.  The whole day the aroma drove me crazy.  I had soaked the beans overnight so was prepared to have a shorter cooking time, but I guess the beans were older.  I wound up cooking this for about 5 and a half hours, and it was fabulous.  All I did was warm up some crusty bread to eat with it.  I will be having it again tonight...in fact, right now!  Great recipe!

I made this today and was surprised how quickly it cooked. I did not pre-soak the beans, and it was done in 3 1/2 hours. I sauted the onions, garlic and ham first with non-fat spray, plus added carrots.  Used half vegetable broth and half water, plus the chicken bullion. Did not add salt, bay leaf, or parsley. Did add a little cayanne pepper. I was skeptical of the tomatos since they are not my favorite thing in soup, but they are really good. It does not turn it into a "tomato based soup" if you know what I mean, they are just a nice addition.

This recipe is "SOUPER" FANTASTIC!  Wow - it was so much better than anticipated!  I added one can of tomato soup with the second addition of water.  I used fewer diced tomatoes because of this (don't like tomato chunks too much)!  Wow, the flavour was really awesome!  I also used just a basic chicken stock all the way, instead of plain water.  Even the kids loved this one!  Best recipe I've found yet!!!! Thanks!!! :-)))

I made this in the slow cooker. I decreased the amount of beans so that everything would fit. I cooked it on low for about 8 hours and the flavor was tremendous! I also added uncooked bacon in the beginning which gave off lots of flavor as it cooked down. I added carrots also. The result was a very rich and thick soup. The stalk was thick; not too runny. I will definately make this again!

YUM! I made this today and YEEHAAAA!  It was GREAT!  I made a few subtle changes as follows:  I got one of those mongo-sized chicken broth cans (49.5 oz) and for the initial "water" used 4 cups water plus appx 2.5 cups broth.  The rest of the broth I dumped in for the second addition of water (and used no water that time at all).  I still used the bullion cube initially.  I added ham hocks as well as a half lb of chopped up ham, and I used an extra celery stick.  Oh, and it cooked a full 6 hours (which is what it took to get the beans to soften).  THOSE ARE THE ONLY CHANGES I made!  It really was delicious... SO FULL OF FLAVOR!  Needed no second seasoning w/S&P (maybe cause of the broth?).  Everyone loved this incl my 7 yr old.  I served w/french breat and thats it!   THANKS!

What a great recipe!  My father used to make very good bean soup, but I couldn't remember just what the ingredients were.  I think this recipe has them all, except for carrots, which I added.  The one thing I did differently was that I didn't add that last 3 cups of water because we like soups like this to be pretty thick, and this came out perfectly with just the initial 6 cups of water. Thanks, Angela!

The aroma of this soup is wonderful.
I used a hambone leftover from christmas and some extra ham. I also used fresh garlic and some garlic powder. I had only fresh Italian (flat leaf) so I used that instead of the dried. Also I had Better than Boullion paste I substituted for the cube. Everything came out wonderful and delish! It wasnt to thick or to thin, just perfect. I like to add lots and lots of fresh ground black pepper to mine.

First tip; never add salt to cooking beans, don't know the reason but if you do add salt the beans never get done all the way, could be a reason for your crunch. My mother made the best bean soup ever and she always started with leftover ham bone (flavor is in the bone) also believe it or not at the very end of making the soup ....for a large pot of soup add 3-4 tbl. of cider vinegar. People will have NO idea what's different but it does give the soup more flavor. Good luck. Hope I helped.

This is an excellent and flavor filled recipe. As for the beans not being done beause of the tomatoes, just cover the dried beans with water in a stock pot, bring to a boil for two minutes, turn off the heat, cover and let soak for an hour. Drain off the water and put the beans back in the pot with the recipes ingredients and the beans will be be done in the stated time. I did add carrots and had no celery in the fridge, so I used a handful of dried celery flakes. I used leftover ham and cooked the beans for an hour with the hambone before removing the bone and adding the other ingredients. I also pureed my tomatoes with my immersion blender only because I like the creamier consistency it gives to the broth. Just tasted it and it's yummy. Can't wait for dinner tonight.

This wouldn't fit in my 4 quart crockpot so I went with low flame on the stovetop.  Read several reviews here so made some mods but also tried staying true to the original.  Soaked beans 1hr prior, rinse.  Sprinkled a little brown sugar just in case tomatoes effected beans. Added all ingredients at once except turkey ham (my only sub) went in the last 1-1/2 hrs.  Also at that point added 1 small bag baby carrots chopped & 8 petite red potatoes chunked.  After 2hrs all my water was absorbed & beans still firm so I don't know how people didn't add the remaining water, maybe it's different in a crockpot?  About 30min before finish I put 4 big spoonfuls in the food processor then dumped that back in the pot to make it creamy instead of watery.  End result was great flavor & thickness, will definitely make again! ps- left out the salt & didn't miss it!

I made this for the teen group at church.  The theme was "Living Simply so that others can Simply live".  After tasting this, I'm not sure it fits the theme, it so SO GOOD!  I tripled the recipe, and used canned chicken broth.  I also added carrots for color and used rotel tomatoes.  Instead of ham (which would get pricy) I used some turkey sausage I had on hand.  It was great!  Just a hint that my dear grandmother gave me:  Don't cook the beans in the same liquid you soak them in and you will gut down on the gassy side effect of bean soups...

Well, this turned out great!  I had never had this soup before but my husband's mother made it all his life  (she had passed away before I could meet her).  He said to me one day "can you make some navy bean soup?"  I told him I didn't know how.  He said "my mom used to make it and she used ....".  I thought "oh boy, how do I make something his mother made and I can't ask her anything?".  So, I found your recipe and it had most of the ingredients that he said he mother used (I added carrots).  I made your soup yesterday and he couldn't get enough of it.  Thank you for sharing!

Awesome soup! I used left over roast beef gravy plus added chicken broth to equal the 6 cups it was about 2/3 & 1/3 respectively.  It was OMGoodness good!!  I also used smoked hog jowl and hickory smoked long link sausage (1 lb) because that is what I had on hand. The sausage was added towards the end.  Try it beef gravy!

My husband was having a potassium difficiency, so I went in search of recipes that were high in potassium.   My husband grew up with navy bean soup, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  My husband won't eat ham, so I substituted 1/2 lb. chopped smoked turkey.  I like things with a little spice, so I used Rotel tomatoes, which contain green chilis.  Because the Rotel tomatoes come in smaller cans, I used two cans and reduced the water by 1/2 cup.   My husband really enjoyed it.  He said when they were kids, they would load it up with ketchup, but that wasn't necessary.  There was plenty of flavor and potassium - this fit the bill exactly.

I put this one in the crockpot and it did very well.  I omitted the 3 cups water that's mentioned at the end of the recipe figuring I could always add it along if the soup was too thick.  It was just the right consistency without it. I am from the South and used to a little different taste on navy beans so I would leave out the diced tomatoes next time, or perhaps cut it in half. The tomato sort of moved the taste away from the navy beans.  Overall it was good and I will certainly make it again.

This smelled absolutely delicious, but what a disappointment! The beans were crunchy and the whole soup lacked flavor. This just did not turn out at all.

I loved this soup so much!   I only changed a few things:  Used all chicken broth instead of water/bouillon.  Used 2 onions, fresh parsley, and cayenne pepper instead of black.  I added a ham hock purchased at the store.  This ham hock apparently had some salt, as I needed no additional salt for the soup.  I really don't like tomato based soups.  But, after reading the reviews, I realized that the chopped tomatoes would not turn into a tomato soup.   I wouldn't leave them out, as I think they added to the soup.  But they didn't cook down into a tomato-based soup, for which I was happy.    I think that the soup was marvelous.  I might change next time to use "reduced sodium" chicken broth, as the ham hock provides all the salt the soup really needs.

I tried this soup because I lost the recipe I usually use for bean soup. This soup was a huge hit with everyone - even the kids! I did use chicken broth for at least half the water, and I soaked the beans overnight. I also used two cans diced tomatoes and a little Tabasco. Yum!

Great soup after I cooked it "my way". I use ham stock (I make, then freeze) from a leftover ham bone (or use smoked ham hocks?) I recommend using this for any bean w/ham soup for rich deep flavor. Maybe I should post a recipe for this, eh?  Onwards: I did "softly" boil navy beans (w/tblsp of Baking soda) for 3 minutes (use a large pot as it will foam up) turn off heat & let em sit for an hour. Drained/rinsed beans then adding to 4 cups ham stock in clean large pot. I used bay leaf, celery, onion, garlic, 1 tblsp Worchester & additional water to cover beans by 1". I did add 3 diced carrots too. *Don't add tomatos or anything acidic during 1st 2 hours  or your beans won't soften (as stated previously.) I think a tsp of liquid smoke would add some dimension if you don't have stock to use. I didn't need chicken bouillion and use salt (if needed) during last hour. I did add some cayenne pepper & tsp of dried thyme. Soup has better developed flavor the next day! A splash of lemon juice shortly before serving gives any bean soup a bright note of flavor :)

Very good flavorful soup.  I used a ham bone and cooked everything together.  Removed the bone and fat at the end of 2 hours.  Used chicken stock in place of the water and also added carrots, more fresh garlic(didn't use the powder) and onions.  I used fresh parsley too. Also added liquid smoke and 4 T. of cider vinegar at the end.  I didn't add anymore ham as there was quite a bit on the bone and I also did not add 3 more cups of water - probably just added another cup of chicken stock.

This soup was exceptional.  I followed the recipe but did have to make a few adjustments because of what I had on hand.  Turned out great and I'll do it the same way next time.  I only had a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies so used that instead of plain tomatoes.  Also used all fresh garlic instead of fresh AND powdered.  Aside from that I followed the recipe to the tee.  Of..didn't add extra salt because other ingredients already has so much salt in them. Thank you very much!!!

A very good soup!!!  I gave it 4 stars because I did alter the recipe a bit.  I used a ham bone instead of chopped ham and WOW it was over the top!!!  I also only used 6 cups of water and cooked it for 5 hours on high in my crock pot.  I did soak my beans overnight and then drained them and put them in the crock pot with everything else.  Before serving, I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and it melted nicely into the soup for a little extra flavor.  I WILL be making this again for my family!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!!

“It is the best Navy Bean Soup I’ve ever tried”, direct words from my husband, former navy. 
I love it! Extremely delicious! It is even better the next day! 
I made one change: instead of 3 cups of water I put 11/2 and cooked in a slow-cooker.

First let me say that I've made Navy Bean soup many times. I used to buy the flavor packet they sold at the Honeybaked Hams store, it was delicious! Then they quit selling it and I began my search for a good recipe.  I can now say that I've found it!  My family and I give this recipe 5 stars! That said I did eliminate the tomatoes, and because we like a little thicker broth, I added about 1/2 cup of instant mashed potatoes ( a little trick my Mom taught me).  It really is the best Navy Bean Soup I've had in a very long time! BTW... I did use a Honeybaked ham bone left over from Thanksgiving, I do think their hams make the best soup!

I gave this recipe three stars because it is flawed, but does offer a good start to a great navy bean soup.  For a true "restaurant quality" navy bean soup, delete the can of tomatoes completely, simmer with a ham bone and ham for two hours, and then at the end of two hours, pour in a can of tomato soup to get the broth "just right".  Completely unnecessary to add three cups of water and then simmer for an additional two hours.  After two hours, your veggies will be a soggy mess.  Just add the tomato soup, adjust water as necessary to give you a good consistency (may need about 4-5 ounces) and then adjust salt to taste, and voila, perfect restaurant navy bean soup!

I really enjoyed this soup, delicious!  The only change I made based on other reviews was to use 3 cups of water and 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth.  I also added lots of fresh spinach for extra nutrition!  I added elbow macaroni to my kids soup which they loved!  Great recipe.

I loved this soup! It was thick and hearty and a blizzard was blowing outside! It made me feel warm and cozy. I did use turkey bacon instead of the ham and was delicious. I did soak my beans for an hour and a half on the stove. Put everything in the slow cooker and was amazed at the final outcome!

Good recipe, but make sure your beans are fresh!  I made the mistake of grabbing a bag of beans from the back of my cupboard.  Stale beans will never soften no matter how long you cook them.  I ate it even though the beans were dry and the skins were tough, but my husband and daughter had chicken nuggets.  I'll have to try again after I've given my husband enough time to forget about this mishap.  I gave it 4 stars because of what it could have been =(

My husband and I nearly ate all of this in one sitting.  I had to substitute based on what I had on hand - so 1 can of chicken broth instead of adding chicken boullion. I added carrots and couple of dashes of hot sauce.  Fixed in the crock pot and served with Jiffy cornbread.  Thanks for contribution - cannot wait to have it again.

Excellent soup! Loved the flavors...easy to make..one pot deal! I did add chopped carrots and the juice from the can of tomatoes. I cooked this soup on very low simmer for about 4-5 hours...perfect. I highly suggest soaking the dried navy beans overnight...they plump up and cook easier. Great warm-u-up meal with fresh bread and salad. Thanks Angela!

This was so delicious and easy.  I already made navy beans so all I had to do was throw everything into the crock pot and put it on high before I left to workout.  When I came back I had a nicely simmering, flavorful soup waiting for me.

love this so much.  I use 2 chicken breast in place of ham.   I saute 3-4 garlic cloves & the onion in olive oil & then add to the soup.  Also I soak my beans in spring water for 24 hours prior to making... dump out the water you soak the beans in add fresh spring water.   very tasty meal!   I also serve over brown rice.

Very delicious and seasoned well.  My stepmom who is 89 loved it and everyone raves about her soup so for her to have liked it so much it truely was good.  I did add a couple of small carrots though however.  Other than that I was faithful to the recipe.

This soup is amazing!
I doubled the recipe and used a 1kg (~2lb) smoked ham.
My mother-in-law and husband are from Eastern Europe, where bean soup is a staple.
My husband said it was the best bean soup he's ever had.
My mother-in-law said that I can get married now because this bean soup is fantastic!

Delicious! I made the following adaptations due to what I had on-hand, and it was out of this world. 
1 (15 oz.) can black beans,
1 (15 oz.) can white beans,
6 cups Swanson organic chicken broth (in place of water),
2 extra stalks of celery,
turkey ham, pre-cooked (optional, but sooo good),
no bouillon needed due to broth
no garlic powder needed; fresh was enough.
All other ingreds. kept the same.  
Thank you for the recipe, Angchick!

Incredible with a few tweaks. I soaked some mixed beans overnight, then I cooked the ham bone with the initial ingredients and six cups of liquid (three chicken stock, three water. Added an extra clove of garlic, and tossed in three chopped carrots and some lentils about 45 min before it was done. Never added the last three cups of water. Incredible,  and flavorful.

I did not care for this soup.  Since it could be a personal taste thing, I did not want to give it a bad review.  It didn't have any off flavors, but just an overall taste I didn't like.  The majority of the flavor I tasted was smokiness from the bacon, but little else.   Also, You may want to cook the beans alone (in water) 1 1/2 hours before adding the other ingredients. Using tomatoes or other acidic things at the beginning, will make it so the beans will either not cook all the way through or it will take 8-12 hours to do so.

This is really good. The only changes I made was to add carrots and I used ham soup base instead of chicken boullion. Next time I will wait for the last 2 hours of cooking to add the celery, carrots and ham. They got a bit mushy for my taste cooking from the begining. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I followed the recipe except for a few things. I soaked my beans for 24 hours,changing the water twice. I also slow cooked the recipe in a crockpot for approximately 12 hours. I left the ham bones in, until the beans finished cooking, then removed them to allow more room in the pot. It is delicious.

This has to be the best bean soup I have ever eaten-my husband and I LOVED it!

And I know many people hate it when people post that they like it and then say what they changed-we did make 2 changes.  First, I chopped two carrots very fine and added to the soup.  Second, we used a ham hock instead of just ham.  It isn't too salty, and is delicious.  I am adding this to my cookbook.

Family ate this up and RAVED about it.  I did not include bay leaf or bouillon as I did not have them - just water.  Family ate it before I could even add tomatoes.  Brought beans to boil, then let them sit for 2 hours, then cooked in crockpot for about 5 hours.  Easy, smelled great, and tasted wonderful!

Excellent Soup! I also added in two chopped carrots. As suggested in your bean information page, I added the tomatoes and salt at the very end so that the beans won't stay hard inside. This will definately be one of my favourite soups on a cold winters day!

Delicious! I have made this several times since the first time I downloaded the recipe! This Easter I didnt buy chicken stock so I used the chicken bouillion as recipe stated but I think I prefer the chicken stock. I also boiled the ham bone in plain water before adding to the soup as someone else had suggested. That was a great tip and this recipe is just delicious! Just like my mom used to make!

OMG- this soup is amazing! I made this mostly for my hubby as I didn't think I would like it at all....well, was I ever wrong! This is quite easily one of the best soups I have ever made! I had made a ham and made broth from the bone instead of using water as the recipe called for. I didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I used fresh. It was done in 3.5 hours instead of 4. Eating some right now - amazing!

This is great stuff!  I used ham stock instead of water, and then used Butterball turkey sausage instead of the ham.  My house smells like I am a REAL COOK who knows what to do!  It is delicious!!!

This was excellent!  I used a ham bone left over from christmas and no additional meat and it was perfect.  Also used fresh tomato since I had extras and 2 carrots.  I went ahead and added the extra 3 C water in the beginning only because I needed to cover my ham bone and it only simmered for about 3 1/4 hours covered since we like our soup a little on the brothy side.  Right before serving I added about 1T vinegar to cut the sweetness from my glazed ham.  This will be my navy bean soup recipe from now on!

This recipe was great! Instead of straight water, I did use half chicken broth. I also added a few dashes each of paprika and cayenne pepper. 

My mom used to make a variation of this soup when I was little, but this was so much better! (sorry Mom) I will definitely be making again.. this is the perfect winter soup. Thanks!

I made this soup today with a Smoked Ham Hock and I added Liquid Smoke because I love the flavour that the smoke gives it...it is delicious but I had to simmer it for almost 6 hours, not the suggested 4 hours the recipe stated. I didn't add the salt or chicken cube until after the 5th hour of cooking, knowing well that salt inhibits the cooking of the beans. While the recipe did not state to soak the beans overnight, I think I will definately add this step in the future to see if it will make a difference in the cooking time. With that said, this is really a delicious soup that you can make on the back burner on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

I didn't add the boullian because the ham makes it salty enough. Too much ham, it was too salty and kind of flavorless. I would cut back on the ham so the flavor of the beans comes through more.

Great base recipe and easy to customize.  I let it simmer all day in the slow cooker.  I also added chopped carrots, ommitted tomatoes and used smoked bacon instead of ham.  Delicious!

I made this soup and it was fantastic!  I soaked the beans overnight, used a can of crushed tomatoes and used smoked ham shanks for the ham.  (These really, really made the soup).  I made it one day and we had it the next and it couldn't have been better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

What a delicious soup!!!  Thanks, Angela--I tried it in a crock-pot and my beans were a little tough, but it's probably because I kept lifting the lid to taste it while it was cooking!  :)   I also added carrots the last 2 1/2 hours--for slow cooker purposes--probably the last hour and a half is good enough or the carrots will be mushy.
I also prefer using a ham bone---bones always seem to just add a bit more flavor.    This recipe is a keep for the winter in my home!  LOVED IT!

This is a great recipe -- I doubled it and added 4 large carrots, finely chopped since I like to get my veggies in any way I can!!:) I also used turkey ham instead of regular ham; that lowers the fat content and ensures that the soup isn't too salty.  I brought this to work and everyone was having seconds and asking for the recipe -- thanks, Angela!!!

Subtle garlic and pepper undertones, combined with the light hickory flavor from the ham, make this soup as flavorful as it is hearty.

 I could'nt believe how easy it was.  This soup will definately become my traditional use for the Easter ham leftovers.

Good a"as is" but for me it should be thickened to make it a 5 star recipe. I took out ~1.5 cups of the soup and pureed it in the blender then added it back in.

DELICIOUS!  This basic soup has a very good base. I soaked northern beans overnight.  I added celery, carrots, a little more onion than stated, a dash of Mrs. Dash, a tub of Knorr chicken stock, a pinch of garlic powder, diced ham and three strips of diced bacon with drippings.  I also added added two teaspoons of tomato paste.  I halved the recipe and it was perfectly done in just over two hours. I'll make more servings next time now  that I know how very good it is.  Served it with a mandarin salad and french bread.  My husband absolutely loved it!  It will definitely become a winter staple at our house!

I was not sure about the tomatoes in the soup but it really turned out great.  We will make this again.  I did not use the ham or the Chicken stock, just veggie stock.  I did add some liquid smoke and some smoked paprika.  Kind of faked DH on the missing ham.

Wonderful! I adapted a bit based on other reviews. Soaked the beans overnight, used a combination of stock from ham bone and chicken broth as well as cayenne pepper and extra black pepper. After a few hours it was good - after 8 hours in the crock pot it was excellent! Will be making this again ... And again.

I like more hearty soups and made this with a 2 lb ham bone (1.5 lb of ham once bone was removed)and it turned out great. I did not add the 1 tsp salt and had to add a little more water at the end. The soup was the best navy bean soup I have ever had.

This is a truly good bean soup recipe. What makes it so is: no presoaking of the beans; no sauteeing; no odd, hard to find ingredients; superb flavor. Right before I finished the simmering I scooped out a cup of the beans, pureed them, and threw the puree back into the pot. This made the soup creamy and thick (but not too thick) without having to cook the beans even more. The soup is complex with a little bit of texture from the tomato and onion bits. I made the recipe exactly as written, and discovered also that 8 oz of cooked ham already chopped can be purchased at the grocery store. Now there's a first. I really, really like the great flavor and simplicity of this recipe--it's a keeper.

Very good recipe but I dont think I would make it again.  I did make a few changes.  like most others I added carrots and used chicken broth instead of water, other then that I made it exaxtly as written. My only other comment would be that it tasted a lot like can pork and beans.

I followed gregoryz's tip to cook the ham bone first. I had a meaty one that I cooked in the six cups of water called for in the recipe. Meanwhile, I boiled a bunch of water in another stock pot, and turned off the heat when I put the beans in to soak. I let them soak over an hour, then drained off the water in a colander--someone said if you don't use the same water to cook the beans that they won't give you as much gas. The jury's out on that. I then put the beans in with the ham bone and the water I'd been cooking it in. I followed the recipe (except no bouillon cube) up until it calls for 3 cups of water. I used 4 cups of chicken broth instead and added a bunch of ham. It made a little too much broth so I mashed a can of northern beans to thicken it. It was really tasty, although I could've added some salt and cut down a cup of the chicken broth.

I LOVED this soup. With some of the additions from the reviews (bullion instead of water - 15 bean instead of navy) and a can of tomato sauce it was incredible. Each day it tasted better.

I substituted smoked turkey and used a quart of chicken (or vegetarian "no chicken" broth in place of boulion and part of the water, used fresh parsley (3-4T) and increased the vegetables (more celery, carrots and garlic and added a little bit of leftover cauliflower and red bell pepper) but otherwise basically followed the recipe and thought it was excellent!  I garnished with fresh chopped parsley and chopped red bell pepper and served with corn bread. 
My husband praised it and even my toddler ate it!

Made this once with bacon and of course a little salsa. It was FANTASTIC! I had never eaten Navy Beans but yum, yum.
Making it again today with a hambone, and RoTel Hot Chopped Tomatoes and some fresh grape tomatoes (less work). It smells awesome.

Excellent Soup! I added some carrots to mine, and I didn't have any dried parsley. I'll be making this again, but I will use half the amount of tomatoes to suite my own taste.

Thank you for the recipe!

Great basic bean soup recipe. I used a big ham bone from a spiral ham with a lot of meat on it, and simmered the beans with it, half an onion, a whole carrot, a couple of celery stalks & bay leaves until the beans were just tender. Then I removed the mushy vegetables & bones, shredded the ham, added a 28 oz can of tomatoes (I love tomatoes), more water and chopped carrots, onion, celery, potatoes, green pepper, a stock cube and some thyme, oregano and chili-garlic puree. Simmered until the vegetables were tender and it was the best bean soup I've ever made! It made a HUGE pot with lots of leftovers for the freezer. Delicious.

Sorry.  I love bean soup, but this version is not a winner.  It's just too bland and the flavor just is not resolved right.  It tastes like there is something missing.

Excellent and worth my 5 stars.  I only made a few minor changes. I soaked the beans over night.  I didn't have onion so I used dried minced onion.  No celery so I used dried celery seed.  I didn't add the parsley, or garlic powder.  I used 3 Ham hocks, a cup of carrots, and 8 cups of water..It was very delish and a recipe I will certainly make again.

I just made this today and it was a total success, except for my 2 and a half year old. The only difference I did was I used hunts fire roasted diced tomatos, added carrots, and I used turkey ham. It was fabulous!!!

This was great, and even my son who doesn't like beans enjoyed it.  I cooked a leftover ham bone in the 6 cups of water for about an hour, then added the beans and cooked for another 2 hours.  At that point I added the chopped ham, 4 pieces of cooked bacon, and the veggies because I didn't want them to get to soft or overcooked, and I cooked it for another hour.  I also threw in a couple of chopped carrots and a potato at this point.  I accidentally forgot the tomatoes, and I didn't have any garlic powder, but it tasted great anyway.

This soup was amazing!!! I cut the recipe in half and added some left over bacon I had in the fridge and a yukon potato and added a bit more tomatoes as well. I didn't add as much water as was recommended because I wanted a thicker soup and it turned out great. This will become a staple at my house!

I like this as a base.  The reason the beans didn't cook in the recipes is becasue they added the tomatoes too early.  Acid in tomatoes will keep the cellulose in vegetables esp beans bron breaking down...I boilb for ten munites then simmer the beans for one hour.  I also used chix and veg stock...I use more water and put in mashed potatoes to thicken.

A very outstanding basic bean soup. I had never made a bean soup before so I read the comments of others and ended up with the following mods (and a great soup): PRE SOAK THE BEANS overnight, this reduced cooking time to 2 hrs, double the Worcestershire Sauce, parsley, and powdered garlic, add some Franks hot sauce, feel free to over do the ham. I skipped the tomatoes b/c the acid could impact the beans cooking. Great recipe, a keeper!

Great Soup!!  My whole family loved this soup...I did make a couple of subtle changes: I used 8 cups of chicken broth at the beginning of cooking (and never needed to add more liquid) and used 1 lb. of ham and 1 1/2 cups of chopped carrots .....oh, and I also soaked the beans overnight resulting in the soup being ready in 3 hours. I will definitely use this recipe regularly!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

A good recipe. I prefer my soups a little thicker, though. I added carrots, extra bouillon and extra celery. I didn't have any onion on hand, so I omitted that. It was a very hearty soup. I made more than I needed so I can have a yummy and healthy soup ready to eat!!  =D

Very savory, and easily altered to your taste preference. I don't use ham very often: if I have it, I do, if I don't, it's great w/o it. I don't think the soup needs the bay leaf. Sometimes, I think people put them in becasue they are expected in soup... this one has so many flavors and spices already, it just gets lost and almost leaves a bitter aftertaste... Maybe it is mixing poorly with another spice. I add extra cayanne.

I cooked this in a crock pot. If you go this route - you want to up the setting to high for the last 2 hours or so to make sure the beans are adequately cooked. I added extra celery. The next time I prepare this I'm going to add more hame. A great meal for a cold winter day.

Great starter recipe.  I made the following changes and everyone raved about the texture and flavor.

I made this with leftover honey smoked spiral ham from Christmas dinner.  I removed most of the meat from the bone and simmered it for 11/2 hours with 2 bay leaves,which were then discarded.  While this was cooking the beans were simmered for 11/2 hours.

Using 5 cups of water from the ham bone and 4 cups of chicken broth I drained and added the beans, ham cut in bite size pieces, tomatoes, onions, celery, 2tbs minced garlic, worcestershire sauce,pepper and two course chopped carrots. A few shakes of Franks red hot and liquid smoke kicked it up a bit. 

Simmered this for another 2 hours and served with cornmeal biscuits.  Even better the next day.

I just went to my deli counter and asked for two thick slices of ham and then chopped it up at home.  After the soup was finished I took out about a cup and a half and pureed it in my mini blender.  This made the consistency of the soup just perfect!  a little bit more of a creamier base....All in all, it was just simple and healthy and turned out delicious!  I also took another reviewer's advice and made some cornbread to go with it and that made a great meal.

I used canned beans instead of dried, so I did not add the extra water at the end.  Soup was pretty thin (this is likely my fault since the dried beans would have soaked up some water) so I added a scant cup of mashed potato flakes.  I also added hot pepper flakes and extra black pepper - we liked that punch of heat.

This recipe was very good.  I made it with a ham bone that was left over. My family enjoyed this.  This is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I never seem to have ham on hand when I want to make this soup, so instead of ham I've used smoked sausage with very good results. Delish! Served with Portuguese Sweet Bread from this site, it makes for a great rainy day meal.

My father-in-law says it is so good I should sell the recipe! My wife loved it, but it is in some way a real "guy" soup. Probably a Super Bowl hit. It is that good!

I thought this soup was excellent. I soaked my beans in advance, which eliminated an hour of cooking time. and also added carrots and little extra ham. Delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This soup is FANTASTIC!  It has a little zip to it which is very nice.  The only thing I changed was to add some carrots.  I've made this a few times and it will stay in my recipe box.

Very good soup. I used 6 cups of canned chicken broth instead of the water, I also used 1 pd of ham hocks and had no celery on hand. I added 3 small potatoes and about a half a cup of potato flakes to thicken it up. Way yummyyy....Thanks for the great recipe..

Great recipe.  Didn't have ham so I used a little smoked bacon and smoked sausage.  Instead of canned tomatos I added a chopped roma tomato.  The fam loved it.  Great with french bread and a salad!  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

We thought this was excellent.  Very easy to put together, even though it takes a while to cook.  It is worth every minute.  I added carrots the last hour of cooking and replaced 1/2 of the water with chicken broth.  I also added a ham hock that I had on hand in the freezer, otherwise, I think it would still be good without.  Very filling.  Bread is all that is needed as a side!

Angela came real close to hitting this one out of the ball park.  The soup was very flavorful, although I used chicken stock instead of water, I think the water would have been sufficient to carry all the delicious flavors.  The recipe is so easy and tastes so much better than a doctored up jar of northern white beans.  I will definetely be using this recipe whenever I have a hankering for bean soup!

I made this a few nights ago and for the most part we liked it; however it was really on the salty side.  I only put 1/2 tsp salt but if was still sooooo salty.  I should have known better since there is salt coming from other ingredients, especially the ham.  Also the recipe is confusing as to the water needed.  Water is mentioned 3 times!  Even tho I used all the water, it still thickened up at the end of the cooking time.  If beans were pre-soaked, you could cut down on cooking time.  I will definitely make again but will not add any salt!

This was okay. I am not sure I liked the tomato in this soup, but it might just be because my family is use to white beans and rice. It tasted like white beans with salsa in them. Both of my kids (1 and 3 years old) ate it, which is a plus.

After a few tweaks, this was the best bean soup I've ever made. Changes were: added Kombu to cooking beans to soften and add great flavor; dry mustard, thyme, and carrot coins added during last hour of cooking. Served company supper with beet/onion salad and butter rolls. Received great reviews.

This turned out great, with a change. I add the tomatoes *after* the beans have cooked.  I always add salt/seasonings in the beginning of any recipe so beans absorb the flavor as they cook, and have always had tender beans at the end.  However, if you add tomatoes before the beans cook and the ratio is high enough, the acidity of the tomatoes results in crunchy beans irregardless how long you cook them.  Other than that adjustment, the recipe is perfect, and the flavor is even better the following day. :)

First time I have made navy bean soup in a long time.  My husband and a co-worker of his loved it.  I did not use diced ham I used a ham hock and made it in the crock pot.  Soup seems to turn out best when it cooks low and slow.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made this last night for my family and they loved it! I followed the recipe to a "T" for the most part because I had never made this before. So, it turned out fantastic. I soaked my beans overnight and cooked the beans with ham neckbones though. This was my only deviation from the original recipe. I chopped up all of my other ingredients and included them alrogether. The soup pretty much cooked itself. I waited until I could see that the neckbones were falling apart and shut off the stove. Then, I deboned the neckbones and returned the meat to the pot and served the finished soup, warm along with some cornbread. It turned out better than I thought it would. It's a nice recipe to have when you have several things going on at the same time and still need to make something for everyone to eat. It is pretty much hassle free. The most time consuming thing was chopping up the items to be included in the soup. Other than that, I checked on it every so often and made sure the liquid didn't dissppear. It is easy to prepare, filling, tasty, budget and "on the go" friendly! Thank you for sharing it with me! - Dionne Angeles

This soup was excellent! I cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven on top of the stove & served it with corn bread. I did not use any salt what  so ever. I used bacon which I baked on 450 till crispy. It added better flavor than a ham hock. I caramelized the onions in the bacon grease till blackened.  I put the carrots & potatoes in the last 40 minutes before serving so that they were not mushy.  I add a bit of sweet potatoes for the vitamin A.  It came out perfect!  I froze the remaining soup in 2 cup rubbermaid containers.

I soaked the beans overnight, drained and rinsed them.  I lightly sweated the onion and celery with sliced carrots, then added the beans and 3 cups of water.  Instead of diced tomatoes, I used 1/3 can (~3oz) of tomato paste; (I just wanted a hint of tomato taste like my mom used to make).  I didn’t add Worcestershire or garlic.  I brought it to a boil, then simmered  on low for about 3 hours.  It turned out thick and hearty, and was even better the next day.  This was a great base recipe to use in trying to replicate my mother’s version of navy bean soup.

I made it with the ingredients as written except for dried parsley. Dried parsley has little to no flavor, so I don't buy it. I did change the process because adding the tomatoes (or any acid) before the beans are cooked will  the cooking process. Acid binds to the bean's seed coat and makes it harder and more impervious to water. By the way, salt does not make beans tough. That's a myth.

One for a cold night meal since it is very hearty.  The one thing l would drop out of the recipe is the Worchestershire sauce.  Once it was added it gave the broth a twang that did not appeal to my palate.

This soup is the Cats meow. The only change I made was I used chicken broth in place of Bouillon cube and water. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Just to give people heads up, when cooking dried beans you must never add tomatoes until the beans are soft. Once you add tomatoes the beans will not soften much more. This recipe and many more like it are incorrect.

What a great find for my very first navy bean soup!  No changes, just followed the recipe with fantastic results.  Soaked the beans more than 12 hours (advice from family) then just assembled ingredients and let it simmer all afternoon.  We used meaty ham shanks which turned out perfect.  My Husband was impressed...and asked me to make it again!

This is the best soup recipe I have made so far. It was very tasty, flavorful, and filling. My husband is a picky bean soup eater and he even loved the soup, said it was my best by far. I highly recommend this recipe. Delicious!

This soup is excellent. I like to eat vegetarian when I can and substituted “Better than bouillon” brand vegetable base instead of the ham and chicken bouillon. Probably put around 2 tablespoons in as the substitute. Still delicious even with that change. I found if you make this in your crock pot...cook on high for at least 8 hours and watch the water level.  I’m making it a second time today on the stovetop. UPDATE: I have probably made this at least 10 times now and it is my go to bean recipe now. I put it in the crock pot before I go to bed and it's ready in the morning to pack for lunch.

I made this yesterday - according to directions with the exception of adding carrot slices at the end for color.  While it was cooking, I wasn't sure how I felt about the Worchester Sauce but as the beans softened and opened they seemed to absorb some of the sauce taste and by the end of cooking, it was perfect!  My son & granddaughters stopped by and loved it as did my sister.  In the end, by the time I divided some off for the others, I ended up with only a few bowls for myself!  I will definitely use this recipe from here on.  I've made bean soup for years but this version is even better.  I hate when people use a recipe and change half the ingredients - then they rate what is essentially not the same thing at all.  I don't think I really "changed" much by adding the carrots - they're just a part of almost every soup made around here!

This recipe calls for chopped ham... but I see people referencing the ham BONE in their comments. I used CHOPPED HAM, which has no bone. Mine's cooking now and it smells wonderful... I hope I didn't screw it up. Based on the ease of preparation, look and smell, I'm giving it 5 stars.

This was awesome, the only thing I added extra was  powdered cayenne pepper. I like to make a recipe just like the poster recommends the first time I try a new recipe. Then the second time I add my own changes. How else can you say you've tried it if you make too many changes. I'ts no longer the same recipe. I know I added cayenne but I like a little heat.
 This will be made again !!!

I probably had a lot more water in the first phase of cooking since I boiled down a ham bone first to start the broth because I didn't need to add more water.  My soup was done in only 1.5 hours.  I also put baking soda in my bean water soak so maybe that made them softer anyway.  The flavor was just what I wanted.

I made this soup and it was delicious! I like my soups thick so I added a bag of butter mashed potatoes along with a cup of water with 2tbsp of flour whisked in til smooth. I also use a ham shank instead of diced ham but diced ham is also good

Great soup! I used  a can of tomato soup rather than diced tomatoes. Next time I will skip the salt, I think ham seems to be salty enough in general.  Glad I have more ham bones in the freezer for another batch.

I will keep this for a good basic recipe for ham and beans.  I did, however, substitute tomato soup for the canned tomatoes, because I don't care for chunks of tomatoes in ham and beans.  I also added carrots and used smoked applewood sea salt.

This is definitely a keeper.  I always soaked the beans overnight, so I was curious to see how the beans would come out.  They were perfect - better than when I soak them, because they weren't as mushy.  I didn't have the diced tomatoes, so I used 8 oz tomato sauce and 4-6 oz of water and turned out just fine.  I also used the Easter ham bone along with the chopped up ham.

Delicious! I soaked the beans overnight and they still had a nice firmness. I thought it was a little watery so I puréed part of it once it was finished and then cooked on high 30 minutes with the lid off to thicken. Turned out perfect!

Thank you for this great recipe.  I use "Better Than Ham" bouillon instead of the chicken bouillon and thicken the soup by mashing some of the beans and adding back to the pot.  Your recipe is fantastic.

Absolutely fantastic soup. I doubled the recipe and it came out great. One suggestion: to cut down on cooking time soak the beans for about an hour before using.

This soup is good,but not great.  I used 4 cups chicken broth & 2 cups water, eliminated the bouillon cube. It got alot better when I added a small can of tomato sauce and a couple of drops of liquid smoke. I will make it again.

So yummy! Reminded me somewhat of canned bean with bacon soup but so much better! I added carrots like others have suggested to try to incorporate more veggies. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. It turned out great! Everyone who tried it complimented my cooking. :)

Making this again tonight for dinner.  I'm not a big bean eater, but this...I LOVE.  Very easy recipe. I think I've made it enough times now that I almost know the recipe by heart. Very tasty.  I like it with a nice hard roll.  Can also easily be made vegetarian by leaving out the ham and using vegetable bouillion insteand of chicken.

This turned out very good.  I used bacon instead of ham, and left out the tomatoes (that was not on purpose!)  Next time I hope to remember to add the tomatoes.  Served with cornbread.

This was great - omitted the tomatoes and bay leaf, and added a few extra chicken bouillon cubes, probably would have still tasted great as is.   Soaked beans overnight and put in crockpot on high - was done by 4-5 hours (did add some extra water).  Kids even gobbled it up (5yo & 3yo!)  :)

Just the recipe I've been looking for! Extremely easy to prepare, and the results are delicious! We had this for dinner tonight, and it was a definite comfort food after having a week of El Nino storms.  The only ingredient I added was a half-teaspoon of brown sugar. This helps cut the acidity some canned tomatoes have.  I used navy beans that had been in the pantry for a while, so it took about 5 hours total to prepare the soup. I didn't have a ham bone or hocks on hand, so I used a ham steak.  I really liked the fact that pre-soaking was not required. This recipe is a definite recommend!--Thanks!

Great Recipe.  The only change I made was added Rotel tomatoes with green peppers.  I doubled it, thinking I would be able to freeze for another meal, but not much left.

Ehh, this was just so so for me. I cooked it for 8 hrs in my crock pot and the beans were still a tad hard. Used 1/2 chicken broth/water combo, and left the tomato out. It just didn't have enough oomph to it, for us.

My kids (most of whom are decidedly against beans) liked this!! I only made 1/2 a lb of beans because we usually have a lot left over, and it lasts for weeks. My son had three servings, and some of us ended up a little hungry! Good stuff!

If you put in the tomatoes, the beans will not cook properly.  I recommend making this without the tomatoes.  It is 5 stars without tomatoes.

Wow!  This was the best navy bean soup I've ever had!  I only made a couple of changes.  I had a VERY meaty honeybaked ham bone so I stewed it with onions, celery and bay leaf the day before I made the soup.  I strained the stock, refrigerated overnight and skimmed the fat the next day.  I separated the fat and bone in the solids from the stock and returned at least a half pound of the stewed meat into the soup recipe.  I prepared the remainder of the recipe as directed, substituting 4 cups of ham stock and 1 can of low sodium chicken broth for the original six cups of water.  I also substituted low sodium chicken broth for the last three cups of water.  I did not add any salt as the ham provided plenty.

This soup was very good. i cooked it in a slow cooker. I admittedly made some changes. I did not have celery. I used navy beans, chopped tomatoes, carrots, corn, red and yellow peppers, basil, salt and pepper and 4 bouillon cubes with 8 cups of water. I did not use ham and I forgot the garlic, but the soup was still tasty.

For the most part I followed the recipe as written except I followed one reviewer's tip and added carrots.  Also cooked the ham bone as one suggested and omitted the salt.  This is a very good and flavorful soup as written.  Will definitely make again!!!

Very tastey!  I used 5 chicken broth cubes and seven cups of water initially.  I didn't feel it needed more water when it was done.  I also used the pressure cooker at 15lbs for 45 minutes to speed cooking.  I didn't have ham so I substituted Canadian bacon and I added tabasco to my portion to spice it up.  I will make this again!!

It's a hearty soup, but a little too heavy on flavor (maybe just the salt?). I used pre-cooked, pre-cubed ham and they turned into flavorless chunks.  I would rather use a ham bone or salt pork and skip the extra salt. I would definitely make again with a few tweaks.

Excellent recipe - a few changes for me were I added carrots, used chicken broth (as well as water) and I also used left over ham bone, along with some bacon for taste.  Makes alot of soup and I got rave reviews!

Made this for my husband as he loves navy bean soup. There was not enough liquid in this soup for him. I even added the extra water as suggested. I am going to try and salvage this soup by adding some more chicken bouillon and water.

This soup was very good but a little salty.  I soaked the beans before cooking and added a couple of diced carrots as well as the ham bone.  Topped it with the cheddar corn dumplings from the Tangy Bean Soup recipe on this site.  Next time will omit the salt and add about 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for a little zip.......or will use Rotel tomatoes instead of regular canned tomatoes.  That would do it too.

I really liked this and would have given it a 5 but I served it to a crowd of 12 and none really had much to say about it except that it was good.  When no one says "this is really good" or asks for a recipe, I usually assume that either I like bean soup more than other people, or that it just wasn't a recipe to rave about.  Everyone ate it and no empty bowls came back.

This was VERY salty. It was tasy, but I've had something similar, "Tuscan Bean Soup(TBS)" made with hot sausage, and the TBS was MUCH better. If I added the tomatoes, spinach and condensed milk, I think this recipe would be better, but just like the TBS.

I thought this soup was pretty good, but not my favorite Navy Bean soup recipe.  For me personally, the diced tomatoes just didn't work in this soup. I might make it again and omit the tomatoes. The texture was nice, the beans cooked well in the suggested cooking time.

This recipe was great. I made it exactly as written, and it's delicious. Taste great with corn bread.

Loved this soup, but made these variations to pack more of a vitamin punch:  added 2 banana peppers (very mild) cut into rings with the onion, plus another 2 cloves of garlic -- all of these were added raw.  Did not add garlic salt, but did add another bouillon cube and a pinch of seasoned salt.  (I can imagine the amount of salt needed depends on how salty is the ham).  Substituted 1/2 CELERY ROOT for celery as root has more flavor and a load more vitamin content.  Cut  carrots (3) and parsnips (2) into fairly thin medallions and added in last hour of cooking -- these amounts can change according to taste and how it looks.  Also added a pinch of hot pepper seeds to final broth.  These really aren't big changes and the soup comes out delicious.  Just like to take advantage of getting as many vegetables into soup as I can -- and they all went together very very well.

I'm giving 5 stars even though my soup is not ready yet. It's been 4 hours now and the beans are still a little chewy, but everything else is good. Since my husband won't be home til tomorrow, I'm sure it'll be great in time for dinner with him. These kinds of soups are always better the next day anyway. I tossed in the ham bone leftover from our Easter ham, and omitted the tomatoes since I'm not familiar with that version. Planning to serve it with warm rolls. Mmmmmm.....

I made this in the crockpot set on low and cooked it over night.  I didn't add the onion, bouillon, or bay leaf (didn't have them on hand) and it was still awesome!!!  The kids ate it up like mad after playing in the snow all day.  Served it with five grain bread mini loaves and it was a filling meal.  Cheap to make too, which this SAHM is very thankful for.  Great recipe, thanks a bunch!!!

I made a few small changes -- 1 tbsp Worcestershire instead of 2, no tomatoes, dried onion instead of fresh, and only added 1 cup water after two hours to get a thicker soup.  We were really happy with the consistency, and the beans were done in 3 1/2 hours so the wait wasn't too bad.  It did get a little bland for me after a few bites, so I'd like to try using a ham bone next time, or maybe ham bouillon instead of chicken.  Also, adding less water meant we ended up with 2 large dinner servings and 3 smaller lunch-sized leftover servings, instead of 9 servings.

This was absoultely fantastic! Everyone loved it! I soaked the beans overnight so this reduced the time to cook it. It really cooked very fast that way. I used turkey ham in place of the regular ham and you couldn't tell any difference. This is definitely a recipe that will be used over and over again by me!

Wonderful recipe!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Well, I did add a can of chicken broth in the 3-cups-of-water part of the recipe.  (I had dropped the can of broth and the pop top was snapped which is why I wanted to make soup in the first place.)  Thanks for sharing!

I liked this soup alot--it was very easy to make and it was delicious.  I was short on onions so I added a package of onion soup mix.  I also added  a large carrot sliced, a tsp of basil and a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.  After about two hours the beans were done and I had the pot on a low simmer.  I don't like to cook my soups too long because things start to fall apart, but this is a personal preference.  I think letting the soup age for a day or so improves the flavor more than cooking it for another couple of hours.  It also seems a bit salty to me which might have something to do with the soup mix, otherwise a big hit.  Thanks.

This soup was awesome!  I had four(4) bowls prior to the Souperbowl, and one during halftime.

For a beginning, bachelor chef, this was a simple recipe to throw together.  (The recipe was slightly confusing as there are two calls for water (6 cups & 3 cups).  Do the 6 cups initially, then add more over time.)

After two hours, I added about 2tps of Garlic Salt to bring it to my tastes.

Although this recipe takes a long time to cook, it doesn't take long to compose the ingredients.  It just needs a stir every now and then.  Also next time I'm going to chop the ham in a cuisinart.

Wow!  This is souper soup!  It was very easy to prepare and tastes great.  I sauted the veggies in a tiny bit of olive oil and butter before mixing in with the beans, water, etc.  I don't know that it made any difference but it's a force of habit.  I think the Worcester Sauce is a key ingredient.  In any event, this recipe is now one of my "standards".  Thanks Angela!

I made this and didn't realize until I was halfway into it that I didn't have diced tomatoes. I just left them out. It turned out okay with a couple tweaks...added diced green peppers and carrots and some other spices. Would have been better with tomatoes.

I didn't add the ham or Worcester sauce. 
The soup was awesome, my husband loved it also.
Will make it again for sure.

My family loved it.  I did not add the additional water toward the end and enjoyed it as a thicker soup.  
I happened to have a ham bone in the freezer from a prior meal and set it in the pot to simmer along with other ingredients.  
I will make this again!

Unlike the majority of folks who rated this recipe, I actually followed it.  It was an easy to follow recipe, but I think the Worcestershire sauce overpowered the taste of this soup, robbing the beans and ham from being the stars. 

I am amazed at how many people gave it 5 stars after saying "... and here is what I changed ...".  Are y'all rating this recipe our your own?

Excellent flavor. I'm not sure how this would actually cook in 2 hours though. It took at least 4 without soaking the beans overnight.

I used ham and added smoked hammocks. No need to add additional salt.

I used 64 oz of chicken broth and forgot the Worcestershire sauce but otherwise stuck pretty close to the recipe.  I used a spice mix plus the  bay leaf rather than individual spices.  I only added a couple shakes of salt and was glad because it would have been way too salty; maybe because of the spice mix I used.  I may have used more ham too.  I also took out some of the broth, let it cool and added a couple heaping teaspoons of corn starch to it and stirred it back in to make the broth a little thicker.  I think these changes are minimal.  It was a great soup; very tasteful and filling enough even for my husband, who is a big eater.  Just served with cracker this time but have made cornbread in the past.  I also had enough left over to freeze and make another quick meal in the future.  By the way, I chopped carrots, celery, onion and ham the day before so everything was ready to go the next day.  All together, the soup took 3 hours to cook.  I cooked the beans in the chicken broth for 1 hour and then added all the veggies.  I threw in the ham for the last hour.

Thank you so much for this recipe. My husband loved it. It was so easy. I added ham bone as we had one left over from Thanksgiving. I cooked the recipe in the crock pot 8 hours . I omitted the Bay leaf only because I did not have one on hand. This recipe is a keeper.  Going to make  again with left over ham from Christmas.

I combined the best two recommendations on here. Simmered the ham bone from my spiral ham in vegetable broth for an hour. Used a bag of dried 15 beans that I boiled for 10 minuets to soften. Added the ham broth (minus the bone) to the slow cooker with all the ingredients. Followed the rest of the recipe. Cooked on low for the day. Terrific with some fresh bread!!!

So good!  After reading the reviews where people liked the smokey flavor of bacon added to the recipe I decided to use kielbasa rather than ham- I love how kielbasa flavors a soup broth! I diced the kielbasa and onion and threw them in the slow cooker with a little oil on high for about an hour. Then I tossed in the rest of the ingredients and turned the heat to low overnight.  PERFECT fall recipe.  I used a can of Ro*tel instead of regular diced tomatoes and added a can of tomato sauce, 1 Tbsp of Italian Seasoning, 1 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp chile-lime seasoning, and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  So ridiculously good!

With Hurricane Harvey moving in my direction, I had to make this quick.  Here are my shortcuts.  I used yellow eye beans, similar to navy's, but an heirloom bean available from Rancho Gordo online.  I like to use heirlooms when possible.  1# dried yellow eyes to 8 cups of water in pressure cooker for 30 minutes on high.  Add garlic, salt, bay, and especially 1 tablespoon of olive oil to prevent foaming that could clog vent.  Let pressure drop on its own.
Add 1 cup each, celery, carrot, onion.  I had cooked a ham several days before and saved drippings.  Into the pressure cooker all with a dash of Worchester and hot sauce.  Add parsley if you like.  I salt and pepper at table.
Use pressure cooker on soup setting and off you go.  I am not done.  Into the canner for the final stage.  No worries about losing power.  My soup is safe

This is a great navy bean soup.  I did soak the beans overnight.  Also left out the celery and parsley, for lack thereof.  I boiled the hambone in water, removed the meat and discarded the bone, and used that water to cook the beans, adding a bouillon cube as directed.  Added no salt, but did use more pepper than instructed.  Perhaps because of the pre-soak, did not need additional water.  Yummy stuff; thanks for sharing

I did make some changes. I cooked the beans alone for 1 1/2 hours, until the water was completely absorbed and set aside... then I sautéed the onions, garlic, ham, celery (added carrots) in bacon grease for about 10 min. Then I added the beans, 6 cups of water, the appropriate amount of bullion per cup, FRESH tomatoes, spices (added paprika) and Worcestershire . (No bay leaf) and I let that simmer for another 1 1/2 hours. It was already great at that point but I added a pinch of black pepper and Cayenne pepper at the end (no salt needed) and it was spectacular! Probably the best soup I've ever had. I will make it again.

My family loved this soup!  I took the advice of the reviewer that used tomato soup in place of diced tomatoes because my family doesn't like diced tomatoes.  We used 3 cans of northern white beans (drained).  We put one of the cans in the blender and this made the soup "creamy" looking.  We only put in half a can of condensed tomato soup.  Since the beans were canned we did not add the additional 3 cups of water.  We only used the 6 cups of water.  I also used about 2 1/2 cubes of boullion.

I've made this a couple of times.  I double the recipe.  What we don't eat goes in the freezer.  I use 2-48 oz. jars of Randall's northern beans (navy) that are already cooked.  Never had much luck with getting the beans soft so I always use these beans.  Just drain and rinse and throw them in.  I also use chicken stock in place of the water and cubed ham I bought in the store.  I've made it using a hambone but we don't have ham that often so this is an easy alternative and just as good.  I threw in two cans of roasted diced tomatoes.  I use only 1 Tb. of Worcestershire.  I don't like the taste of boullian cubes so I don't add them.  Everything else is the same.

Added 1/4 t ground cloves. Mine wasn't thick at all but I wish it was, maybe because I couldn't find dried navy beans and had to use canned.

I set out with a recipe in mind, but couldn't quite recall. I used this as a guide only. I did do the quick boil three times on beans, recommended by pharmacist to relieve gas and to cook beans more because I sauteed vegetables iin olive oil also. My veggie choice from my childhood memories were carrots, celery, and onions. I was generous.  I boiled hambone first while I quickboiled beans seperately.  I picked meat off and cleaned bones out. Then using water from ham I addeadded beans then vegetables.. Cook time low two hours. Did not need to puree or add flour to thicken as I like juice especially when served with cornbread!!! Delicious and thanks for all the tips and guide recipe

Really good and easy to make.  I used the juice and meat from a ham so I improvised on how much water to add.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It turned out delicious!

I needed to use a Smithfield Ham Steak that I'd bought on sale so naturally, I searched AllRecipes for anything containing chopped ham. It's a weeknight so time is limited but this sounded so good that I thought I'd just turn it into a quick, weeknight dinner. I used canned navy beans, a can of field peas with snaps, a can of chicken broth, a couple chicken bullion cubes, a can of petite diced tomatoes, chopped onion, chopped celery, garlic powder, bay leaves, thyme, salt, pepper and the chopped up ham steak. I threw it all in a pot, brought it to a boil, then let it simmer for about an hour. It was so good. Granted, I'm sure the original is probably better, this short version worked well for me on a weeknight when I really had no dinner plan and it was absolutely delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow so easy. My husband loved the soup! I needed to make a quick dinner by morning that I could take to work the next day. That night I put everything in a crock pot. In the morning I added the salt and pepper and 3 cups water then let it cook the additional couple of hours. 
I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I made it. For every TBSP WS = 2 tsp soy sauce, 1/4 tsp. each of lemon juice and sugar, dash of hot sauce. It called for 2 TBSP WS so I doubled this recipe.

1/9/2016, I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes.  My family told me it tasted a little spicy.  My wife thought the recipe had too much pepper.  The can of sliced tomatoes also changed the taste of the soup.  When it was finished cooking the soup taste more like a vegetable soup.  This recipe was ok.  I won't use it again without making some changes.

Love this soup served with raised rolls. I do make a couple changes: I use 4c. of vegetable broth in place of all the water. I use 1T onion powder instead of the onion. Add a hamhock (just because) to everything. I cook it in a crock pot on high for 6.5 hours.

This soup is so good!! I couldn't find dry navy beans at my store, so I used dry white beans. Substituted most of the water with low sodium chicken stock, and added carrots. Cooked in a crock pot for 9-10 hrs, then blended it with my immersible hand blender. Very, very good!!

BEST EVER!  I usually use smoked ham hock or shank and replace the regular can diced tomatoes with Rotel Diced Tomato With Green Chilis, to give it some kick. My husband always wants me to make enough to have leftovers.  It just gets better.  Mmmm

I followed the recipe but used 6 cups chicken broth instead of water and cooked down a ham bone in 3 cups of water with celery tops for later.  I added LOTS of carrots (as my family loves them).  I did a quick soak of the navy beans before starting the recipe to soften them a bit more.  I added a tidge of liquid smoke and chipotle tobacco sauce.  I also added about 3/4 cup of instant mashed potatoes at the end to thicken it up.  I also added an extra can of navy beans because I like lots of beans.

Great recipe! The only change I made was to add a can of Rotel Tomatoes with green chilies instead of the diced tomatoes. I grew up on navy bean soup, and this was even better than mom's (don't tell her I said that!) ;)

O EM GEE...you have no idea how happy this recipe has made me! My hubby loves this kind of soup, and usually I leave it to my m-in-law to make it for him.  Today, I did the deed, and the results were so delicious - I may be a cook yet! I didn't have dry beans but I did have canned so I used them, and I used chicken broth in place of water as another reviewer suggested. This will go into the rotation, summer, fall, winter and spring! Thank you so much for the recipe!

My family loved this! I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand. I used northern beans instead of the navy, used chopped carrots in place of celery but added about 2 tsp of celery seed, and took others advice and used chicken broth in place of water and boullion (sp?). Will make this again!

This is really amazing.  I did not add the ham, or the tomoatoes, and the flavor was perfect without.  I did add carrots, and sauteed them with some garlic, onion and celery first.  I dumped in the remaining ingredients as suggested and simmered for the prescribed time.  I did not need the extra 3 cups of water at the end, either.  I stored this in the fridge and ate it the next day.  Really, truly, a keeper!

I made this just as the recipe called for..only changed the bouillon cube to two table spoons of knorr chicken flavored bouillon..thus eliminating a need for a lot more added salt...the ham gave it the remaining salt needed..as others reported it was done in 3 1/2 hrs on the stove top..everyone loved it....might add some diced carrots next time.

I am sorry to say I was really disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly (I would never rate one otherwise), but it was not what I was hoping for. The beans were still hard after the cooking time specified in the recipe. It was too watery for my liking, and I didn't like the strong tomato taste. But this is of course, my own personal opinion. I will keep looking for the perfect Navy Bean Soup recipe.

I made this soup because I had lots of leftover ham, but no ham bone. I used homemade chicken stock instead of water and bouillon.  I also used carrots instead of celery.  I had about a 1/2 cup of tomato sauce to use up, so I subbed that for the diced tomatoes. I cooked the beans, drained, and rinsed them.  I then sauteed the carrots, onion, and garlic, before adding the seasoning and tomato sauce.  I then added about 2 C. of diced ham, chicken stock, and the beans.  This turned out beautifully, and was even better the second day.  It wasn't as good soup made with the ham bone, but a good alternative. Thanks.

I made this pretty much as directed and initally wanted to rate the recipe a 3.  It seemed like it was missing something.  I didn't use the tomatoe as that didn't appeal to us and I used mostly chicken broth in place of the water (and still added the bouillon but didn't add any salt and found it didn't need it.)  I soaked my beans for 8 hours and threw it all in the crock pot and cooked for about 8 hours.  It seemed pretty watery and kind of greasy, so I skimmed almost a cup of grease off the top which made a considerable difference (I used a meaty ham bone,) and I added about an 1/8 of a cup of hot sause, mashed down some of the beans, and cooked it for another 2 hours.  I decided to rate this a 4 when my son and daughter couldn't get enough of it!  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll make this again.

Presoaked beans to reduce cooking time, sauted carrots, celery and onion with oil before added other ingredients.  Also added barley (2 c.).  Since we had precooked beans, the amount of water called for still worked well (maybe could have used more).  The barley cooks during the last 20-30 minutes or so.  My husband said there were too many beans (I think we could have used some more liquids, but since I didn't have a can of tomatoes, that played into it some, too.)  We are freezing the second half.  Lastly, we made it vegetarian and had some ham on the side for meat eaters to stir in.  I will make it again.

Thank you for this very simple, but delicious recipe.  This is my new go-to soup recipe.  Very filling and satisfying.  I used Canadian bacon instead of ham with great results.  Next time I will decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp. or omit altogether.

My wife and I both agree this is the best Bean Soup we ever had. I used Randall cooked Navy Beans instead of the raw beans and also cook the ham bone in water and use the brooth for the water as another reviewer said.

This was my first time making navy bean and it turned out really well. I used half chicken broth and half water and no chicken bouillon. If I was to make it again I think I would put a little less of the Worcestershire sauce in it just because it has so much flavor. Turned out great!

You MUST make this soup! I was thoroughly impress on how savory this soup turned out. I made it in the crock pot and left it on low for about 8 hrs. Didn't use a lot of salt since I knew my left over ham bone and bits were salty. I will definitely make this soup again!

WOW!!! This is so easy to make!  It only took two hours... If I can do it, so can you.  Since trying to take out salt from my diet, did the following:  Instead of the canned tomatoes I used freshly picked tomatoes from my garden. Only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and feel could have used none at all... Added chopped carrots for color and one chopped slice of turkey bacon.  Incredible flavor!

This is ok, not great on flavor. Perhaps hot sauce added in while it was cooking would have helped, or as one other reader posted, using a mix of beans instead of just navy beans, would have helped with flavor.

This was a great recipe!  Did as others did and waited to put the tomatoes in.  Used chicken paste instead of bouillon.  Did not have quite enough Worcestershire sauce but still came out perfect - definately a keeper!!!

My family and I absolutely love this recipe! the only thing I do different is I use a combination of Pinto, Navy and Great Northern beans. I always serve it with a mexican cornbread recipe from this site and both are wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a really great recipe. It was a little more liquidy than I expected and I only added 2 or the 3 extra cups of water halfway through. I will do this again for sure.

Great comfort food.  Made it the first time because I had mushy beans, but even they did not disintegrate.  Excellent flavors.  Had to use Canadian bacon.

Fantastic soup.  It was so easy and turned out great.  The only change I made was I didn't have an onion so I used 1 Tbl of dried onion flakes, and I left out the bay leaf.

Simply excellent & so easy to make! The only variations/replacements were: added 3 carrots, used 3 chicken bouillon cubes(prefer the low salt stock), fresh italian parsley, 3 garlic cloves, and although I love tomatoes I omitted them for the kid's sake. The smell of the soup cooking was driving everybody crazy. DELICIOUS!!

Oh my goodness, this soup ROCKS. I used the leftover meat and bone from a ham and followed the recipe pretty closely - I did omit the extra salt and ended up adding water once more because I cooked it longer than the recipe calls for. It was outrageous.

Easy to make.  Good taste.  Great texture.  I used more pepper and less salt.  If you keep it covered the whole time it is cooking the amount of liquid is perfect.  Next time I am going to have to cut the recipe in half.  This makes a lot of soup.

I invited family over to share this and I should have made a double batch.  We literally licked the pot clean!  I used a hambone, added carrots and omitted the tomatoes and celery for personal preference.  Other than that, everything was the same.  I will definitely make this again!!

I love this soup. I only changed 1 thing or 2. I did not have ham or ham bone so I used the leftover ribs from this recipe http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Slow-Cooked-Country-Ribs-in-Gravy/Detail.aspx
I always have mass leftover ribs so this is a great way to use up the ribs.

This was tasty, but the overwhelming flavor really seemed to be salt, which came all from the ham, because I didn't add any more salt.  It was easy, but I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Excellent soup with great flavor. I soaked the beans overnight, so I did not have to cook as long. I also added one cup of carrots to increase the veggie count.  I used diced ham from the meat section. The perfect dinner for those chilly fall and winter nights.

I am not a fan of bean soup of any kind so this is from my husband.  Great soup!  I did not have garlic salt so just used two cloves of garlic and it was fine.  He had two bowls for dinner and took some in his lunch today.  It smelled great all day.  Thanks.

Simply awesome . . Made only 1 change, added hot Italian sausage.  The soup was more like a stew.  Will definately use this recipe again.

GREAT!!!  I didn't use tomatoes, and I used smoked sausage instead of ham, and it turned out wonderful!  My husband is a very picky vegetable eater, and he loved it!  The whole house smelled so good while it was cooking.

This came out incredible!  Just like my mom's when I was a kid.  (She said she doesn't use a recipe, so this one is going in my permanent file!)
Note, I omitted the bay leaf and parsley, and it turned out just fine.  I also had to add a few cups of water during the cooking process. Yummy!!

Very yummy!  Was a big hit with the family tonight!  My DH even ate it and he does not like anything with beans (I found out he thinks it was corn, we will just let him keep that happy thought!).  The only thing I did different was that I thought it would be good with fresh parsley.  When I got home I realized I had picked up cilantro instead.  I went ahead and put it in and it was great!  I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped carrots.

This was good. Pretty filling and healthy. I did not add as much worcestershire as the recipe calls for--I ran out and plus my roommate hates it.
Added carrots. It makes a lot, which is good but after a few bowls no one else was eating it but me.

Excellent recipe. Highly recommend it. I just threw a left-over ham bone and chunks of leftover meat. My family loved it!

I also soaked the beans over night, the soup cooked a lot faster.  I added carrots.  The soup was very good. Thanks
