These were terrific.  I did soak the chicken in buttermilk and did add the suggested black pepper. Really really good.

I love fried chicken and in sandwich form with garden fresh tomatoes is no exception.  I do suggest adding  ground black pepper to the flour mixture.  Chicken breasts tend to to huge, I cut mine in half and then filleted them in half to create thinner pieces of chicken.   Serve with cold slaw and you have a winner!

I followed this recipe, except I did not have any garlic powder, so I used onion powder... and I did not have any buns, I toasted some white bread, I'd make this again...
