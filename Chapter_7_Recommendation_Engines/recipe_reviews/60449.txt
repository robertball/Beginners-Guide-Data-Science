We did not like these.  They were soggy, dry and had too much cheese.  I'll go back to making grilled cheese on the stove-top.

This is a very good sandwich.  The last time I made this I used sourdough bread and added 2 tomato slices and 3 pieces of partially cooked bacon.

Not really grilled at all. This has potential but needs some major revision as far as cooking method. The end result as it stands is a soggy greasy on the outside sandwich that cannot be picked up at all. The bread is too fragile and soggy from the melted butter. I had to toss these in a hot skillet to crisp and brown the outside of this. The cheese was dry and kind of got rubbery when cooled, not gooey like what I'm used to with american/velveeta. Not bad as far as flavor and could use some spices too to perk this up. The broiling idea was great though for browning the cheese and giving it great taste.

Super yummy! I made lunch for my younger sister and she thought it was very tasty! I only added one slice of cheese (per type) per sandwich. I will definitly make again!

Yummy cheesey good! I used the cheddar, provolone and added a slice of swiss instead of the muenster. Loved it on the rye bread. Served with Rich and Creamy Tomato Basil Soup from this site...thanks!

My variation of this tasty sandwich is to add several slices of red onion and cooked bacon.

It is much easier to just pry in a pan or skillet. The rye bread makes this extra delicious.

Had to come up with something to eat since the weather kept us from going to a Super Bowl party. I decided to try this, but I added some imitation crab meat with it. It was awesome.
