This is a great recipe! Just like you get in Scotland. Service with cream, custard or your favourite sauce. I've tried brown sugar, lemon, rum, whisky. All are great!

I love this recipe - my granny always made it for birthdays in the family!  I find that an apple chopped into the mixture really enhances it and makes it that little bit softer.

Served warmed with milk is the best way to eat a clootie dumpling!

Best tasting and easiest recipe I've found.  Tips: Place a saucer upside down in your pot before you drop in the dumpling.  This will prevent your "cloot" or cloth from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

We love Clootie dumpling sliced and fried in butter for breakfast with our bacon and eggs!  If there's white and black pudding and square slice sausage with beans, all the better!!!

Needs more spice,more fruit to give.more depth of flavour,
Also do not understand why only half cup of milk as mixture is very dry

Don't be concerned when stuff falls off when you pull it out of the cloth.  The browning sorts it out.  But it was a little bland, good served with butter or cream.

So good, mine was a bit squishy but delicious.
