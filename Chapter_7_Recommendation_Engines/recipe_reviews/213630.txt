AWESOME!  I had some frozen tomatoes left over from last summer and they worked beautifully.  Roasting the tomatoes is a must, it brings out the wonderful flavor of them.  I don't buy saffron because of the cost but substituted a pinch of tumeric.  Be warned about tumeric, just a pinch or your soup will be over-powered.

Roasted home-grown plum tomatoes and added some milk at the end of the recipe to thin it out and increase the amount of soup. We really liked it and hubby said I could "make that again".

Excellent!  I served this at my book club and everyone loved it!  The only complaint is that a double batch wasn't near enough!

I followed the recipe exactly except substituted the saffron for just a pinch of tumeric. It was awful. I couldn't even eat it. It sounded delicious though.

Loved it!  I didn't have any saffron and added a pinch of turmeric like the previous reviewer.  I also doubled it and even so, it didn't yield a lot.

Made this for lunch today with grilled cheese sandwiches. Amazing!! I used fresh Roma tomatoes, as I needed to use them up, and one can of stewed. Roasted them and put a splash of tomato juice in it. I also used Turmeric instead of saffron, as I didnâ€™t have any. Amazing taste, and the perfect comfort food for these cold winter days ahead. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a simple and absolutely delicious tomato soup. 
I doubled the recipe (glad I did, because the wife and I put away well over the original recipe's worth), left out the celery (only because I forgot it), added a bit more curry powder, and a touch of cayenne for just a little heat. 
I also added about a half a cup of milk to thin it a little and well...because I thought it would be tasty ;) 
We garnished with more cilantro and a dollop of sour cream. Fantastic!

Very good! I did not blend it, added way more curry than called for, and basically tripled it. It was good, but not a lot. I also added garbanzo beans, which did nicely (I roasted them with the tomatoes.

I roasted my own tomatoes as anything from a can lacks the texture and flavor of freshly made food. I also added just enough homemade chicken stock to get the right consistency, and once the tomatoes were finished, placed them with fresh basil in a bowl and loosely covered until cooled. This is not a bad recipe at all, but like with any food, can be tweaked and changed per "customer" :) 

I am only rating this as "OK" because I made changes that bettered the overall outcome. I'd still recommend trying it and keeping an open mind to new ideas that can be added. Tomatoes are SO versatile, so have fun!
