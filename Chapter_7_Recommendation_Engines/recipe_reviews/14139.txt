Very good!! If you're a bannana fanatic, this is the drink for you!  I also add 1/2 cup freshly sliced strawberries and the use of "sweetened pineapple juice" didn't hurt it at all.  Will be serving again and again!

Nice breakfast smoothie.  I like smoothies on the tart side and thought the kiwi added a little tartness.  I thought some type of berry, i.e. raspberry, blackberry or strawberry would have added a lot to this drink.  Nice as is, but not over the top.
