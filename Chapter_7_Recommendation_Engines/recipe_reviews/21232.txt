Everything looked and smelled soooo good until I put the catfish in.  I just wasn't sure about "boiled" fish.  I served it up and my kids wouldn't touch it even after convincing them that this is the same fish I fry w/ french fries.  My husband and I tried it, and both agreed that shrimp would've been far better.  We picked around the catfish.

I held back on the tabasco sauce while cooking this one for the kids' sake and put it out on the table instead for the adults.  I was still skeptical about my kids eating this one but they all liked it and the 2-year-old LOVED it.  This is a great recipe.  We will definitely have it again.

We were looking for a recipe to get rid of some of the okra my wife bought at a farmer's market. This turned out better than expected. Now we have a reason to buy more okra!

Yum. Even my picky, picky soup-hatin' son liked it. It's not so much a gumbo, though, as it has no roux. But oh-so-much easier.

I REALLY like this recipe.  I chose catfish nuggets because they are tons cheaper here.  The only thing is, you have to go through them and check for bones.  It's not a big deal because I figured that I would have to cut them anyway.  The nuggets come cut in little squares and they are fresh.

I made this recipe easier by buying frozen Gumbo vegetables that had celery,onions,corn and okra-a nice short cut- tasted great- I also used catfish nuggets and cut them even smaller to cut down on all the slicing and dicing!  Very good flavor!

This is a great recipe. I didn't add the salt instead I added Ms. Dash and I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes. It was perfect and I will be making it again.

I pan fried my catfish pieces in some oil and creole seasoning, then added them to the soup in the end. This fixed the "boiled fish" problem and it turned out delicious!

This actually turned out better than I expected. Here's what I did: Sauteed veggies in oil, then added a bit of flour and cooked until it was starting to brown. Then I added the broth (which I had premixed). I didn't add okra, but used some carrots and yellow squash instead. I also added dried basil. And finally, I threw in about a quarter cup of rice with the catfish. It is delicious and the perfect consistency. I don't know how it would thicken up if no flour was added.

This was OK.  Not sure that I would make it again.  Flavor is alright, but nothing incredible, and not sure I would call it "gumbo".  I made this because I had all the ingredients on hand and was trying to experiment with catfish.  I used beef broth, and I think you could be happy if you had more broth than what is called for here.  I used a ton of Tabasco (how I roll) and it was decent, but not outstanding.

As written, I'd give it three stars.  I've made this twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe judiciously, and I found it a bit bland for my taste.  The second time, I doubled the amount of bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and thyme.  I cut the salt to 1/2 tspn. and added a tablespoon of Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning. Also, I don't know where they sell diced tomatoes in 8oz. cans, so I, of course, substituted a 15-1/2 oz. can of fire roasted toms and was quite pleased with the outcome.  I'll make it again using my changes.

This was tha bomb!!! The only thing I did different was use half shrimp and half catfish because I had a taste for some shrimp that day. I also used 2 cups of beef broth instead of the bouillion and water combo.  But man, this was good!  It froze well too; I reheated a frozen bowl of soup about 3 weeks later and was amazed again at how tood this was.  Tons of veggies, so you definitly get a serving or two of your daily requirement.  Very flavorful and rich!

Wow....this was great!  I had leeks on hand, so I used those rather than onion, and I also used tilapia rather than catfish.  Needed to get rid of the excess, and I think this would work with just about any type of fish.

I made this for the wife and I two nights in a row! I did chnage the fish each night however. First night I used shark steaks, and the second, swordfish. It was really good. One more deviance, was the hot sauce. Fred's Red Hot instead. AND I will add, do not use 2 hot sauces- learned that lesson the second night. Was a little TOO adventurous. GREAT and EASY. Thanks!!

Very good! My first time trying catfish AND okra, and I liked them. I'm not usually a "fish person", but the catfish was very mild and I enjoyed it.

Really liked this recipe.  Not a true gumbo but who cares; the taste was good.  Next time I am going to try to make a rue first and also add shrimp and crawfish.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! For those who are like me and are addicted to hot food : I added 4 Thai chilies sliced in half and half of a jalapeno for some fire! I also added  2 Tbs of flour since this recipe didn't call for you to make a rue, otherwise it was pretty soupy.

I never eat Gumbo before, so made one yesterday, looking at some recipes, it's great! Love the taste and spicyness :) 
I used anaheim chilli, no bell pepper. No okra either, I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned one. Love it :)

Without the fish it smelled great, but the fish ruined everything. Disclaimer: I'm not a catfish fun; my husband is, but he didn't enjoy this either.
If you're not  a big catfish fun either, I would suggest chicken instead of fish.

I used catfish nuggets; they are often on sale! I added shrimp and turkey sausage to boost the protein.  My family loves it!!!  I didn't have the "cubes" so I used canned chicken broth & canned diced tomatoes with seasoning!!

Yum, is right! Catfish is perfect in this recipe because of it's texture.  We've decided to fix this once a month.

I made this for my family using Swai fillets. When I did an ingredient search this was one that came up. I also had 3 beautiful tomatoes that needed to be eaten so this recipe fit the bill. I used a 12 oz. frozen veggie mixture of onion, celery, and bell pepper and steamed it then added to the soup. Because I have two small kids I didn't add the hot sauce, but I did add the red pepper flakes. This recipe was a bit out of my comfort zone but the whole family really enjoyed it. I added 1/3 cup rice when I added the fish and it was perfect. When I checked it 15 min. later the rice wasn't done and the gumbo was very thin. I mixed flour and water to thicken it up. That was what this recipe really needed. The flavors are great. I would definitely make this again.

This is excellent!!! I thought the spices and the amount of veggies are well balanced. Very pleased and will make this again. I did leave out the celery (only because I was out) and I cooked the veggies in a little bit of water instead of the oil to cut out the fat.

Great way to use frozen okra. The tomato in this cuts any sliminess the okra might have when thawed. My husband and I loved it.

Made this with 20 oz of shrimp instead of catfish.  Very good, but need to reduce the salt a bit to 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon.

This was great !!  I used 1 lb of shrimp instead of the fish (per another viewers suggestion).  I followed the recipe exactly, and I swear I saw my hisband licking the pot afterwards.  This makes enough for 6 servings, but with only the 2 of us, there were NO leftovers !!!  Great recipe, this will be a regular at our table !!

I thought this recipe was a great basis for my own gumbo recipe; being a first time gumbo maker, I used it to inspire me to make my own.  I was inspired! And it was great!

Yum!  I didnt have celery so I just added more green pepper.  Also, added more red pepper and some tobasco.  Delish!  I usually like the sauce to be thicker but didnt want to ruin an already delicious dish.

This was delicious. My husband and kids loved it too and there were no leftovers. Since I had no red pepper flakes or hot pepper sauce, I used a bit of ground cayenne pepper and cajun spice mix instead. It was not spicy (which made my kids happy) but flavorful. A nice healthy alternative to fried catfish. We will definitely make this again and again. A new family favorite!

I loved this! Good flavor, came together easily, and super filling over rice. The only change I made was to add another cup of beef broth in the beginning, and a generous shake of file´ powder at the end. I'd happily make this again.

This is a  terrific recipe!  I have made it many times and it is always delicious..  I use around a pound of shrimp and a pound of whatever white flaky fish looks good.   I recommend using fresh orca if you can find it.

Excellent recipe!! Like another reviewer I used beef stock which saved time. Also added chopped collard greens, salmon, shrimp, oysters, salmon and swai - couldn't find catfish but it still turned out great!

Delicious and healthy!  My version: didn't use green pepper (didn't have it on hand), didn't use garlic (forgot), used 3 fresh good size tomatoes instead of canned diced tomatoes, added carrots, put in oregano and added some salt; didn't use hot pepper sauce.  I reduced simmering time by a few minutes because my family was hungry!  It came out great!  The catfish nuggets that I bought a while back and left in the deep freezer came out well and didn't have the fishy taste at all!

Used tilapia instead of catfish. I added 2 cups of instant rice cooking the rice in the juices of the gumbo. Amazing!!!  Nothing against catfish I eat catfish year round I just ran out of my freezer stock. Can't wait till fishing season.

used chicken stock instead of beef, added 3 tablespoons of my own cajun spice mix. It was very good, first time eating catfish and it's not as unfamiliar tasting as I expected.

This was wonderful!  I used some frozen mackeral I had left from a fishing trip and frozen okra.  It was much better than I expected!  Will definitely make this again.  Might use 3 cups of beef broth next time since I served it over rice.

We had this tonight and my man and I both loved it.  I had about 3/4 pound freshly caught catfish that I filleted.  I almost followed the recipe but added to it a bit.  I added one medium zucchini to the vegetables and omitted the okra.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of the canned.  I added 1/2 Cup brown rice to the bouillon just before the 30 minute simmer.  I also added 3/4 pound salad shrimp because I had it.  It was delicious and gluten free as a bonus.  We will definitely have it again the next time we go cat fishing.
