This recipe was delicious.  I didn't have any Sherry so I used Madeira wine and I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  
I also ladeled the broth in one at a time not all at once.  Also used fresh jalapeno peppers diced.  Will definitely make again.  Husband loved it.

It was a nice change, I added a little hot pepper oil to kick it up. I'll make it again.

overall very good- needed to add a bit more liquid, used spicy chilli sauce instead of actual chillies, added a bit of soya sauce while cooking
