The only changes I made were to use red bell pepper instead of yellow, and I added a little more V8 as the lemon juice and red wine vinegar made it a little too tart for my taste. I really liked this - easy, refreshing and pretty too. Thanks, florida gail!

What a wonderful salad.  I love gazpacho & do have a favorite recipe which I combined with this one.  Added a few more fresh veggies - radishes, zucchini, cauliflower & sliced black olives.  As far as the dressing goes, I used clamato juice and substituted bottled hot sauce and worchestershire sauce for the salsa.  I mixed the cabbage and everything else together but the dressing as I didn't want it to get too soggy as I knew there would be leftovers as I made the whole recipe for just me.  It is a keeper!!!  I have made it twice in the past 2 weeks!!  Great for a picnic as there is no mayo or anything that can spoil in the sun/heat!!

I really liked this slaw but found it a bit acidic. I used Picante-V8 for more zing. Will make this again but cut back on the vinegar.

This works with bagged coleslaw subbed in for the cabbage.  We added a handful of chopped cilantro to the salad, too - really added to the taste.  This is also good with a zesty Italian dressing.  We ate it right away and it was delicious.

This was OK, not great, not bad.  I probably cut my cabbage too thick, but that's how I tend to like it.  We didn't think the flavors blended all that well.  There just wasn't a lot of flavor for us.

This was very flavorful and fresh-tasting. I added red cabbage because I had to use some up, omitted the celery, and used Roasted Tomatillo and Garlic Salsa, from this site, which added a great flavor. Next time, I'll use my favorite, nontraditional gazpacho recipe: tomato, yellow pepper, corn, apple, cider vinegar, garlic, and basil.

Interesting and quite tasty! I planned to make without subs (except omitting the celery as per personal preference), but midway realized that I didn't have V-8 so subbed tomato sauce.  I love V-8 and am sure it would be better with V-8 so I'm looking forward to making this again.  The only change I might make next time is to make a bit more dressing.  Anyway, this is a keeper!  (PS:  I used bagged angel hair cut cabbage.  The bag I bought was right at five cups.)

Used bagged slaw, added cilantro and jalapeno with the vegetables, used lime instead of lemon, a little more V-8 and a little less vinegar.  Tossed with diced avocado before serving.  Beautiful and tasty!

I love gazpacho soup, so I thought I'd give this a try. It was well worth it even though I misread the recipe and added more olive oil than it called for. I didn't have any red wine vinegar on hand, so I used equal amounts of red wine and a light oriental rice vinegar instead. It turned out just fine. We had some leftover, so I drained all the liquid off. Tomorrow I'll add more V8 to it and make Gaspacho Soup with it for our lunch. Thanks for the great idea!
