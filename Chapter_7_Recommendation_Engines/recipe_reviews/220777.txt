Great little appetizers and so so easy. I have been making these for 30 years. I use dill weed instead of Italian style dry dressing. Cukes on top are good. I have also put shreadded cheese and sliced black olives on top. Remember though..... these can not be made the 
night before. The bread gets soggy.

My sister gave me a recipe very much like this. We use regular cream cheese softened mixed with the Good Seasons dry Italain dressing, no sour cream, cucumber on top and sprinkle dill on top of cukes. The party pumpernickel breads are perfect if you can get them. It is great, super easy to make, and feeds a crowd.

These are sooo delicious!  We didn't have the cocktail bread so I cut regular pumpernickel into small circles.  My daughter requested cucumber sandwiches for her birthday party and her friends loved these (all 10 year olds!).  I plan on eating these all Summer.  YUM!

It was super easy! I did it just a little different. I baked the little pumpernickels into toasts and it added a fun crunch. And I alternated sprinkling them the black pepper and red pepper for and little spice :)

Excellent appetizer. I prefer to use the seedless French cucumbers. They have a better flavor, and people like my husband can eat them without burping.

We enjoyed this recipe; however, we did not care for the small, deli appetizer size pumpernickel bread.  We found it to be dry and hard, etc.

So, we got a regular loaf of pumpernickel in the bakery section of the grocery store.  We like that much better; the texture is much more soft & moist.  One can cut this into small square s and make the same recipe!

This was simple, but greatly appreciated at a dinner party I attended. Healthier than a lot of appetizers. I might make it again just to eat at home.

I made this for two separate gatherings, and they were a hit at each! I plan on making them again, but I'm thinking of substituting the Italian dressing mix for ranch dressing mix. I think the ranch would be really nice with the cucumbers!

Wonderful!  Reminded me of the cucumber sandwiches that made me feel so grown up when I finally was old enough to attend baby and bridal showers at church.  If making ahead of time, I spread an almost non existent coating of butter on the bread to keep from getting soggy in the fridge.  I can't stand a soggy sammy!  Thanks!

I couldn't find the bread I wanted, so I used a can to cut rounds out of regular slices of pumpernickel. Everything else was simple to assemble. They look good on the platter and were popular with one of the picky eaters.

I doubled the recipe and made these for a party and they were a huge hit! I could not find the party-sized pumpernickel bread so I used a couple of flower-shaped cookie cutters to cut shapes from regular sliced pumpernickel bread. As another reviewer suggested,  I too, sprinkled dill on the top of the sandwiches. I recommend using English cucumbers, as these contain little to no seeds. If transporting to a party, these are easy to stack in a container and separate layers with parchment paper. Awesome for a party, but be sure to keep some for yourself!
