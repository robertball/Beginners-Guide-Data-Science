The results were great...the best part being the tangy lime juice in contrast to the buttery cracker crumbs. I did need to double-dredge my eggplant to get the cracker crumbs to stick well. I dipped in egg/lime, then flour, then again in egg lime then pounded down in bowl of crumbs to "encourage" a good coating. Just a dab of sauce made these scrumptious morsels. I can think of many uses for these tasty rounds...pita stuffings and salad toppings (in place of chicen in chicken ceasar salad for instance). Very nice Cindy.

Simple, delicious recipe. Did not have onion powder, so I diced up some red onion real fine; did not have garlic powder, so I minced a garlic clove. Used whole grain Ritz crackers. Kept the rest of the recipe as is and it turned out great.

We loved these! Needed a little extra salt or seasoning but the sauce was a really nice compliment to the crackery coating. We will make these again soon! Might add some mushroom to top it off! Thanks.

Less Pepper, more crackers (the egg mixture coagulates the egg crumbs).  I think a greased shallow baking dish will be better than a cookie sheet which is what I will use next time.  'Twas OK.

This was good! My husband, 15 month old, and I loved it. My picky 2 and a half year old not so much, but that doesn't say much. I will make this again with less salt as the crackers are pretty salty already. I might add half a tsp. Instead of a whole. I did spray the tops of the eggplant as well as the pan with oil (lightly) before putting it in to bake. We had it with spaghetti in marinara and a salad.
