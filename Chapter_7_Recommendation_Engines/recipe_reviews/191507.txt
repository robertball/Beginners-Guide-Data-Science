I grew up in Little Italy in Boston. I knew better than to try another gravy recipe other than mine, but I thought I would try something new. I added chicken broth instead of water and doubled it because the water amount didnt seen enough. Sorry...The only flavor is from a few cloves of garlic and pork. I really had to doctor it up and its still bland. I have been making gravy for 35 years and consider myself a very experienced cook. I knew this recipe looked bland but I figured what the heck. Should have listened to my instincts.

Way way  too bland and not enough water or broth . I agree woith the other cook I am Italian, my Grandparents came from Italy I use pork neckbones or pork ribs or rib ends  and lots of herbs & spices like oregano, basil, thyme,a couple of bay leaves  a good pinch of red pepper flakes (NOT cayenne pepper) I always sweeten my gravy with a good pinch of sugar   sometimes I add a little fennel seed or anise seed and always use good quality plum or Italian style tomatoes

The recipe was absolutely delicious. It was long process. I did everything in the morning then let it cook all day. For a real italian recipe this nailed it. I did make a few minor changes based on what I already had in my kitchen. Everyone in my family was very pleased.

This is the best recipe for spaghetti sauce that I have found..  Excellent!  What a flavor the pigs feet and pork neck bones give the sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

Like all cooks we use recipes as a base.  I added a couple of spices to the sauce and deleted the pigs feet. I did use the pork neck bones.  I did not leave to whole bones in the sauce.  I pulled off the meat added the meat back to the sauce and gave the bones to the dogs.   For the meatballs instead of the bread soaked in water I used dry bread crumbs. I cooked it a day ahead of time so the flavors would have time meld together.  

I also could not find ground veal at the store so instead I used more pork (really italian saugage) for more added flavor and ground hamburger to make up for the pound of veal that i did not have. 

I was serving 10 people and use one pound of thin spaghetti.  I had plenty of sauce and meatballs left over to freeze and kept some meatballs and sauce to make sub sandwiches with.  

My overall rating is I think it turned out nicely with my own cooking techinques and touch.

I served with a salad and buttered bread.

only made the meatballs and used jarred sauce to finish cooking them in. pretty good, make sure to squeeze as much water out of the bread as possible. I had to be very careful to keep the meatballs from falling apart.

I don't do the pigs feet but I do roast & freeze neck bones so I can have them on hand when I want to make sauce.  If you are worried about little pieces of bone in your sauce tie them up in a piece of cheese cloth & discard when sauce is done.  The roasted bones do add sooo much more to the flavor of the sauce.  I also add a little 
[1/2 teaspoon sugar]] sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato sauce.
We call this our sunday gravy.
