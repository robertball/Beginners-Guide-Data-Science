I took this to a friend's house for a birthday lunch, and it was SLAMMIN'! Quick and easy too. I did use three lo-fat cream cheeses and lo-fat Cool Whip. Also, I had some leftover gingersnaps, so I put those in the crust with the vanilla wafers and omitted the extra sugar. If I'd had more time I'd have skipped the Cool Whip (too much chemicals) and made my own whipped cream topping. ;-)
Instead of adding half the berries to the cake and topping with the rest, I just added them all in the cake, and no one complained. I had to fight for the leftovers to take to two friends who didn't make the party, and made lots of people happy. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This was good and refreshing. I think it would actually taste better slightly frozen. I would advize you to eat it within the same day as the crust tends to get a bit soggy.

I was hoping for something a little lighter.  It is just like a lemon bar with blueberries and whipped topping.  Great flavor though!

Made this for a family dinner and people loved it. My cousin that doesn't like cheesecake said he even liked it. I made it a few less calories by using the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and no sugar pudding.

Nine people loved this, including one who said she doesn't ordinarily like cheesecake.  My only issue with it was that after baking for 50 minutes it looked like it was a little overdone.  It didn't seem to affect the taste or consistency though.  Instead of putting crushed blueberries on top, I made Blueberry Breakfast Sauce from this site and had people spoon some on top of their individual pieces.  I really liked it that way, and would consider leaving off the Cool Whip and just serving it with the sauce.  The lemon/blueberry combination is really delicious!

I made this for Easter Sunday, and it was awesome! I used more blueberries than it says to use though.  I made a whole layer of blueberries under the Cool Whip, and then scattered some on top.  Every loved it!  I think it has to be a tradition now!

Great recipe! I made it for the fourth of July party in my neighborhood and everyone loved it! It was surprisingly light, mind you I made some substitutes, such as 1/3 fat cream cheese, sugar free whipped cream, reduced fat nilla wafers, etc. I'll definitely make it again! (a neighbor asked me to make it for every neighborhood party)
