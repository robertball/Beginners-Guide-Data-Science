This was the first time I made bread without using my breadmaker....and it was very good.  It looked very "fresh from the bakery"...my whole family loved it.  I didn't bake it nearly as long as suggested...it turned golden brown very quickly

GREAT recipe! Most excellent flavor. Looks too pretty to slice into!
I brushed 2 tablespoons of soft butter all over the top(s) as soon as the loaf(s) came out of the oven. Since the basics of kneading, rising and braiding are not included; I would suggest the novice baker do a little research on these three fundamental elements of baking bread, before tackling this recipe. I know the rest of us will include this delicious bread in our favorites file. Thanks so much for sharing.
Peccavi
P.S. Don't forget to lightly grease your
cookie sheet before placing your braided dough on it for the last "rise".
Anyone that's stumped trying to braid a four strand, see my Profile for my email address. I'll send step-by-step instructions.

This bread was good but I would suggest to reduce the baking time,the crust got a little bit hard. I recommend it for special occasions, it looks great on the table!

This was a fantastic recipe - yielding a very yummy bread.   I added vanilla to give it more flavor and liberally sprinkled on poppy seeds as my family loves them.    The bread was a bit doner than I like at 30 minutes, I would suggest checking after 25.

I made this only without the poppy seeds.  It was a very nice looking loaf, and turned out to be much, much larger than I had expected (this makes a good sized loaf).  If I made this again I would defnitely half the recipe.  This was good right out of the oven, but the leftovers did not fare so well; it took on a very chewy, tough texture the next day, and I had to throw it out.

This is the first time I ever tried to make bread. I chose something of my ancestry and it came out perfectly! It was delicious and looked like a pro had made it! Ha ha! Easy and great tasting. No editing at all- followed the recipe exactly!

A really beautiful white bread with a tender crumb. Any chance the ingredients should read '2 egg yolks, 1 egg'? Just wondering because in the directions it says 'egg' and 'egg yolks.' My dough was still really sticky after all 5 cups of flour were in so I had to add more (1 cup or so). Could have been that the eggs I used were really large or the type of flour I used. I made 2 loaves instead of 1 and they were still a decent size. I used a shorter baking time, as so many before have recommended. Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I had a little trouble with the yeast/mild.  I threw out 2 batches, then used an old technique. Dissolved the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water first, then I added 1-1/2 cup warm milk. I warmed 2 tbls. honey in the microwave, added the poppy seeds and brushed it on the warm bread. OMG!

Loved it! This was so easy to make, and I'm not a bread baker typically. I don't like poppy seeds so I just glazed with the egg and it's a beautiful delicious loaf. It did take a bit more than 5c. flour though...

Someone rated this before me and suggested that a first timer not attempt this.  They were correct!  This was just a bit too complicated for me.  I had to rate it so i could review it but I couldn't proplerly give it credit due to the trouble.

This is my go to bread recipe, when I have to have a great bread that works. It tastes great and I have no problem with it ever, so I use it a lot. Love it. I also have used salt instead of poppy seeds for a different taste.

This was the first bread i ever made.  Turned out beautifully, i didnt use any poppy seeds, instead i used cheddar cheese.  i also kneaded some cheddar into the dough.  turned out wonderfully, i did shorten the bake time like another poster had suggested, otherwise i think it would have been too tough.  however, if you are looking for a great bread bowl, this bread makes wonderful breadbowls.  I make this bread every week now!

Beautiful bread and easy to prepare. I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I recommend this recipe.  I had to take it out of the oven early so be careful not to overcook.

Black Friday, I was still "nesting", that is what hubby calls it, I love to cook and bake and will spend hours in the kitchen, I decided to make bread and found this recipe. I haven't made bread in FOREVER, and this turned out great.  

Looked beautiful, and I sent a picture to my son, next thing I know he is at the door asking for dinner. 

Two loaves gone in a day and a half.  I just didn't use the poppy seeds, not really crazy about them.

Oh yeah, and the yeast I used was two years past the expiration, so I proofed it.

I made this bread to go with stuffed peppers from a recipe that my husbands Hungarian grandmother passed on to me. He said it was perfect and it is so easy to put together. Mine only took 25 minutes to cook. This was better the next day after being stored in a ziplock type bag with the air removed.

This makes for some great bread!  There are, however, a few things of note/change in the directions.

The baking time is just too long - 40 minutes at 350 renders it into an almost burnt crust that's as hard as a rock.  I would let it go at 10 minutes top at 350.  (I did 20 and the loaf was ruined IMHO)

Second, this can actually make for 2 good sized loafs.  (Made a 2 ft loaf plus a smaller 8 inch loaf.)  split the dough in half first, then follow the directions from there.  So that you essentially start off with 4 cylindrical loaves . . .

Was a bit tasteless at first but once jam was added into the equation, it tasted so much better. I have to agree that one hour is too long. Thirty minutes is sufficient.

Beautiful, delicious bread.  Followed  the recipe exactly & it turned out great.  It took a little longer for my loaf to double in size.  It browned very quickly in oven so I covered w/foil until finished.  Baking time was less than what was listed for my oven.  Bread is soft, moist and delicious.  Thanks for recipe!

This was a very easy recipe to follow and making the braid was fun.  I substituted one cup of coarse ground grains from a local brewers spent fermentation grains for one cup of white flour.  Delicious.  I will be making this bread again!

I made this bread for my daughter's US Cultures class. It was a big hit and was much easier than I thought! It was a tradition of my Hungarian grandfather's to bake bread every few weeks and deliver a loaf to everyone in the family. This reminded me so much of him and I will now continue his tradition.

I make this every easter and sometimes for other special occasions that a beautiful, tasty bread is needed. I LOVE this bread although I do cover the pan with aluminum foil (for all but the last 15 mins) and I don't bake it for quite as long as it calls for, in order to keep it from getting quite so crunchy on the outside. This is my favorite of all the breads I make, just a little more time consuming.

Oh lord I love this bread!!!  This was my first time making a yeast bread and when it first came out of the oven the crust was a little too crunchy for me.  My mom, who works in a bakery, gave me an amazing tip though, if you wrap the bread up in plastic wrap nice and tight and let it sit over night, the crust softens up for you!!!  I'm eating it as I right this and the crust is Perfect!  I can't believe it actually worked on the first try!

First time making a braided bread, and I was pleased with the results. Nice crust with a soft and chewy inside. Like many of the reviewers, I only baked it about 25 minutes....any longer would have ended up inedible in my opinion. I was surprised that this turned out so well, as I had a heck of a time getting my milk/yeast to get that creamy, foamy look.....in fact, it never did! I tossed out two batches of warm milk and yeast before giving up and just using my third batch. Bread rose just fine. I'm new to bread making, so maybe I just need more experience under my belt.

My 3 year old daughter helped me make this and now all 3 kids are eating slices of nice, yummy, warm bread before bed.  This is a keeper!  (  also didn't have to cook it the full 45 min at the end)
