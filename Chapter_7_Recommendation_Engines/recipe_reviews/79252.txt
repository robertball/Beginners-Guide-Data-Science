Very sweet. The overwhelming sweetness overpowered the natural sweetness of the apricots and the delicious tart dried cherries. Not something I would make again. But I give it 2 stars because all the ladies in my bible study wanted the recipe! Tastes are different.

I really hate to be the first to review a recipe and give a bad review, but my family just didn't like these.  The crust/topping was good, but the end result was just too gooey and sweet for us.

I thought that it was delicious!  But, mine came out very crumbly and was hard to cut into small pieces.  It can also get quite expensive to make because of the cost of nuts and dried fruit.

I cut down the sugar, but I was still the only one who ate more than one piece.  Just not all that great.  Might try again with just cherries or just apricots.
