This is the best chocolate cheesecake recipe ever. It was creamy and everyone loved it. No changes for high altitude needed.

It ended up with good flavor and was very easy to make. My batter was very lumpy because I didn't soften my cream cheese so I used an immersion blender to smooth it out.

This is a divine recipe! My older brother asked for a second piece, and he's a hard one to please! To garnish, I learned how to temper dark chocolate and over-decorated the cake with fun swirls and designs after it chilled for a night. It was tremendous fun to make and tasted amazing!

Made this as written. Very delicious! This is the first time I made cheesecake from scratch. Very creamy and chocolate flavor was perfect. I was a little generous with the chocolate ingredients (slightly heaping cocoa and Ghirardelli chocolate chips) because I wanted a very chocolate flavor and one review said it did not have  a double chocolate flavor. I loved it, my daughter thought it was to strong chocolate flavor for her. Added it to my favorites and will make again for sure. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly. It turned out very creamy and had a nice cheesecake flavor, but double chocolate it is not. If you want a true chocolate cheesecake look elsewhere.

OMG Awesome!
I made this with non fat cream cheese and non fat condensed milk. Baked in a chocolate cookie 12" crust.  So rich and creamy smooth.  This is a keeper and will make again!

Followed recipe exactly. It looks nice, just like the pictures, but there's very little chocolate flavor. And I tasted the batter and added about 1/4 c more sugar, but the final cake was very bland. Wasted 3 blocks of cream cheese.
