I have to admit I was a little skeptical of how the finished product would taste because of so few ingredients, but it turned out great! The only issue I have is the stated amounts for the tomato sauce and the beans are a little odd. 2 cups of sauce is slightly more than what comes in a standard can of tomato sauce, so I added in some water to make up the difference.  My bigger issue was the 24 oz of prepared beans. A standard can of beans is 15oz, and if you drain and rinse them, they are about 8oz. So are we to measure 1.5 cans undrained? Or 3 cans drained? Since the recipe was a little vague, I just threw in 2 cans of rinsed beans and that seemed to be a good consistency. Instead of using 1 tbsp of basil (because this seemed like a lot to me), I used 1 tsp. This was really tasty with freshly grated parmesan on top.

My husband liked it, so all was not lost, but this "soup", which is more like a tomato-based bean stew (and a plain one at that) called for entirely too much onion, and was just boring to me.

Simple but delicious. Easy to throw together in a pinch. My only complaint is that it's a bit too thick, but that's easy to fix.
I did make a few changes, though: I added some mild italian sausage about halfway between adding the onion and adding the garlic. Some other people have said already another change I made, which was adding a bit of water to the can of tomato sauce to get it to 2 cups. It doesn't mess with the flavor, and it helps to thin the soup just a tad. Finally, I used dried Herbs de Provence instead of the basil, since it's a bit too strong for me and I just love Herbs de Provence.

I made this exactly as written.  I let it simmer a couple minutes longer on the stove.  It was filling and quick.  I tasted it before sitting down, and decided it needed some parmesan cheese on it.  That help a lot, but not enough to want to make it again.  Ya'll enjoy! I'm moving on to somethin else.

Delicious and quick healthy meal..
Very simple and would cost so much more if you purchased it and it took a total of 30 minutes to make.

Great soup for a quick meal. I added grated Parmesan and Romano cheese and it was a really good complement to the tomato flavor.
