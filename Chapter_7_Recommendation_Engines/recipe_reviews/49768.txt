This was really delicious.  I marinated my mushrooms with sliced onions in olive oil and balsamic vinegar before putting them in the oven.  I also mixed some horseradish with mayo and the flavors were great!  Thanks!

My husband and I loved this recipe and will definately be making it again.  I did add a thick slice of vidalia onion that I had sauteed in butter on both sides until well browned and softened.  My addition made the sandwich a bit on the tall side, but delicious to eat!

These were excellent and so easy to make.  A nice change of pace from regular burgers.  Just watch out - the horseradish sauce is REALLY overwhelming.  I would go lighter on that next time.  It's hard to taste the other ingredients through that.  Thanks for a great recipe, Elizabeth!

Ohhh super tasty.  Genius idea, wrapping bacon around the mushroom!  I love portobello burgers and this made it even better.  I don't care for horseradish sauce too much though, so I subbed mayo mixed with some chopped capers instead, which I discovered in another portobello burger recipe and HIGHLY recommend. There is just something about it that compliments the earthy, nutty taste of the mushroom perfectly.  I also brushed the mushroom with balsamic and spiced olive oil and added a slice of Monterey Jack cheese.  Now that I think about it, the way I made it pretty much destroyed the whole low-fat thing.. but oh well, it was totally worth it!

Love these fixed on the grill.  My son and his family are vegans, so when we grill out these are perfect for them, as well as anyone else that loves mushrooms!

Before baking, I brushed the caps with balsamic vinegar. I served these on ciabatta bread with horseradish sauce, swiss cheese, and onion rings.

These were delicious and so easy to make! I would've never thought to combine the flavors of turkey bacon and mushroom, but my oh my was it tasty! The only change I made was to put mayo on the top bun and the horseradish sauce on the bottom bun. Will be making this again much more often because it's cheap, easy, and healthy :). Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

These were really easy and really good. I left the horseradish off of mine and added a slice of swiss cheese to them all. A keeper for sure!

I had never made or eaten mushroom burgers before so used this recipe as a base. I marinated mine in teriyaki sause and put them on the grill just like a burger. Yum!! My teenage daughter and I loved them! We don't like horseradish and I didn't have bacon but we added cheese, lettuce, etc. like a regular burger. I can't wait to have these again!

I made this but had to substitute for a few ingredients I didn't have.  I used regular thick sliced bacon on the mushrooms.  I toasted the buns in my toaster, then used mayonaise on each side, along with romaine lettuce.  what I didn't do (but should have) was to let them drain, as these were somewhat too juicy and nearly fell a part.  also, I used baby swiss on them, but it just didn't have the punch of flavor that I was expecting.  my son didn't like them (10 yr old palette) but I did and will make them again.  next time letting them drain, and using a stronger-flavored swiss or gouda cheese.

These were good.  My boyfriend and I both liked them.  The horseradish went well with the other flavors.

Delicious! We had just begun trying to start a heart healthy diet and were very skeptical.  It was great; although, I won't use turkey bacon again.  I will use regular bacon or do without all together.

I loved this recipe but I love mushrooms cooked any way or raw.  I did not have horseradish sauce so I used a little mayo and it was great.  My family did not like this recipe but I loved it.

These were great, the only change I made was to have mayo as a sauce simply because I had run out of horseradish.  Next time I may try cutting the mushrooms to make it an easier eat, but apart from that wouldn't change a thing, nice healthier change from the normal burger.
