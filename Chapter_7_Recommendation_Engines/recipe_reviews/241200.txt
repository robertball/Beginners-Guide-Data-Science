OMG! This was so yummy! I have to admit I cut the heat wayyyyy back cuz we are big wimps when it comes to heat. No habanero and just 1 Tablespoon horseradish. Perfect for a summer meal. Thanks for sharing!

First time I tried this, I followed recipe to a "T" as usual.  A little too spicy for this old mouth, but oh! Goodness!  It had such fabulous flavor!  Next try, I forgot to list the tomato/clam juice cocktail on my shopping list, so I substituted "Mrs. T's Bloody Mary Mix" (which I drink by the gallon!) and cut back the horseradish & hot sauce to taste.  I loved it too, & my adult kids (after adding more hot sauce) did too!  I think I liked them both just exactly, so at least this substitution will work if you need it.  I love the mix plain, & so good for me, with low calorie count. Oh, & I served it to my kids in Margarita glasses with a small spoon!  Nice presentation, I thought.   HTH!    Blessings!

Excellent!  Made exactly as directed except for Habanero because I didn’t have. Will definitely make this again. Better the next day so make night before or early in day if serving that night.

I’m giving it 5 stars for my version.  The original I would give 3-4 because I think it would be way too hot to be enjoyable.  I bought Black Tiger prawns from Costco and sautéed them in white wine just until cooked, transferred them to a bowl to let cool.  I substituted one Serrano pepper for the Habanero and added one jalapeño as well.  I think a 1/4 of prepared horseradish is way too much so I only added 1 1/4 tablespoons and about 20 shots of Tobasco sauce.  That left the dish with a perfect amount of heat and just the right kick.  I added two avocados and 1/2 a cup cilantro to add in.  In hindsight, I would add 3 avocados next time as I found towards the end, I barely had enough of avocados and cilantro to finish the 8 I made.  I added a wedge of lime to the rim of a cobalt blue margarita glass and topped with fresh sprigs of cilantro.  The dish was an absolute hit and I will definitely make it again.  I loved how all the flavours melded together so well.  The Clamato juice I added was perfect for marinating it all.
