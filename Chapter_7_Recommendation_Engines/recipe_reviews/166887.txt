While this is not a classic Bordelaise sauce I couldn't have enjoyed it more.  Hubs and I enjoyed this to accompany our steaks tonight and it was as if the two were meant to be together! (And we don't like sauces of ANY kind with our steaks!)  Rich, dark and hearty, with full, robust flavor. My only criticism is with the addition of the cornstarch, which is neither traditional nor necessary. In hindsight I'd eliminate it altogether, simply reducing the sauce further until the desired thickness.  Also in hindsight, I would skip the salt - there is obviously plenty in the beef broth.  The thyme is the perfect seasoning, much better, in my view, on its own than with the rosemary I expected to be with it.  Great sauce - the two of us cleaned it up!

Foodgasm. That is the best way to describe this sauce. I'd been on a "eh, it tastes okay" cooking streak, and I wanted to impress my boyfriend with a really great meal. THIS IS IT. I followed the recipe exactly, and was liberal with the salt and pepper where they say "to taste." The sauce was robust with flavor; the texture was satiny smooth; I licked the gravy boat and wished I had made more. My boyfriend proclaimed this "fantastic" and was still talking about it the day afterward. And, the best part was, this recipe was incredibly easy. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to make a WOW meal. One suggestion--the recipe, as it's written, makes enough gravy for two, maybe three people; I would double it for 4+ dinner guests.

This is wonderful! I used red onion instead of shallots (just what I had on hand) and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

This tasted really good! But I guess I cooked it a little too long as it didn't make much.  I even added more water to it and it still only came out like maybe a cup and a half.  If you're making this recpie for more than 2 people, double it. Also, I had everything on hand except the shallots so I used regular sweet onion instead and it still tasted great. I used Shiraz as the red wine. Overall a really good recipe!

This is a tasty sauce, but it is NOT Bordelaise! For it to be Bordelaise sauce, it must have bone marrow in it.

This is great.  We had it over rib-eyes, and people scrounged the pot to put it on their baked potato too.

This was delicious...I use sweet onion instead of shallots. The only other changes I made was to use a beef consumme and I added one wedge of laughing cow light cheese which thickend it instead of the cornstarch and water and made it more flavorful. I added my leftover pork tenderloin (elegant pork tenderloin) to the sauce and will have it as leftovers...it's a gourmet meal.

I just made this and it was great!  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter - it was a bit salty and a bit thick so I added a touch more wine and some water to thin it out before I served it.  A big hit even with a guest who dislikes mushrooms!

This sauce worked really well for me tonight. I served it over filet mignon. It was delicious and the perfect consistency (I doubled the amount of cornstarch/water mixture b.c we like sauce a bit thicker). This sauce rivaled restaurant sauce and I will definitely make again.

This sauce was delicious.  Very unlike the bordelaise I had as a child but yummy nonetheless.  I made it with pork tenderloin, which I cut into medallions and seared first.  Out of this world.

This was sooo delicious! I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried. I don't think the recipe suffered at all. I also doubled the recipe for the crowd I was feeding - wish now that I'd tripled it. Everyone wanted it for their baked potatoes, too.

Thank you so much! This recipe is amazing! I made it last night and my husband is still raving about it today. He says he can't stop thinking about it. I followed it pretty much to a T other than substituting onions for shallots. I also used portobellos instead of regular mushrooms. I served it over grilled Filet Mignon. WOW!!!!!!

Wow.  All the review are spot on.  Like usual, I read all the reviews and try to incorporate a little bit of truth from each of them.  If I were to do this again, here is what I'd do differently:

1.  I doubled the 4 servings for 4 people and made 8 for 4 people.......and we barely had any left.

2.  Lots of Cabernet and heavy cream.

3.  Baby port. mushrooms

4.  No cornstarch.

All of my friends are now sitting on the sofa with food coma.  So...good.

I will never use another sauce with steak or schnitzel again! This is absolutely delicious, and is fairly forgiving if you get lazy measuring the butter vs. red wine vs. stock. I've made it twice so far. Second time I used a bit of soy sauce instead of salt to add it a slight depth and a rich brown colour. It was even more fantastic. Thank you for the recipe!

I just made a batch of this and after I had a taste of it I made another batch and a half since I had 3 cups of mushrooms to use up. It is absolutely delicious!  I used heart healthy margarine instead of butter to lower the saturated fat and I didn't add any salt since I find the Worcestershire sauce adds enough.  We are having it with hamburger steak and mashed potatoes and broccoli tonight.  I am freezing the leftover sauce for another day. It is awesome!

Amazing! I did increase the amount of shallots, garlic, and mushrooms. I would suggest using baby portabellas b/c when they cook down they are a great size for the sauce.

The flavors blended well, however I didn't like adding cornstarch and simply thickened by reduction.  Basically I didn't like the consistency - garlic and shallots not breaking down and adding the mushrooms made for a chunky sauce.  I will try again.

very good :)  I had dried shallots at my Dad's I needed to find a purpose for and this was well suited.  Even without bayleaf and using cream of mushroom soup instead of fresh mushrooms it turned out great.  Will have to try the original version sometime.  And when I cook minced garlic is never "optional" its mandatory ;) and I used 1 Tbsp since I doubled the whole recipe (though only used 1 can of cream of mush soup).

Dinner last night was a lobster tail, au gratin potatoes, and beef tenderloin topped with bordelaise sauce.  This sauce made a special meal an extraordinary meal.  I really cooked down the liquid, intensifying the flavor, so I added only half the amount of cornstarch and water to thicken and did add a splash of dry sherry, as well.  I can see topping a big slice of meatloaf with this sauce as well as an expensive steak.  It is a beautiful, rich sauce, simply divine!

I was beyond impressed. WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?! Was SO easy to make and had such a wonderful flavor! After reading other reviews I did double it...and that was perfect for my boyfriend and I. I served it over venison steaks, with a side of mashed potatoes and a blue cheese wedge salad. Thank you for this amazing sauce!

I made this sauce step by step and didn't change a thing. Claret was the type of wine I used. I cooked two different steaks, a ribeye for my boyfriend and a filet for me, and it was more than enough to cover both. I didn't season or marinate the steaks at all because I really wanted to taste the sauce and it was perfect! You don't need to do anything to your steaks, just cook and smother with this sauce. I even had enough left over the next day to mix with our left over roasted potatoes and it was great on those too! Just a awesome versatile recipe that I highly recommend.

My boyfriend made this recipe to top the steaks he grilled (he makes sautéed mushrooms often, but just usually wings it).  This was absolutely delicious....restaurant quality for sure! He used a nice Cabernet. Unfortunately I wasn't feeling well and didn't get a picture of it until the next day, when we had leftovers (it totally doesn't do it justice). I only wish this recipe made more...when he makes it again I will absolutely ask him to double it!

absolutely delicious.   Followed another reviewer's suggestion and used a can of beef consommé instead of beef broth.  It gave extra depth to the sauce.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly using Bella mushrooms.  Sliced medallions of left over filet into the sauce. Wonderful!

I just made this for dinner and it was fabulous with flat irons.  I used a cheap Merlot for the wine and added cream to imitate a sauce we recently had at a steakhouse.  We ended up skipping our potatoes and had an extra piece of bread for sopping up the remnants on our plates.

This was really tasty and simple to make, but I only gave it three stars because of the poor cooking instructions. i followed to a tee and my sauce cooked down to almost nothing in 10 mins, let alone 30. I had to add in some water, more wine and stock to get it back and subsequently made it a little too salty. I dont know where the writer gets needing to reduce for 30 mins. Other than that, I will definitely make this again

I normally hate mushrooms in all forms, but this was amazing!  We put it on grilled steak and it was amazing, I devoured the mushrooms.  The only changes I made was Beef Consomme and added 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream at the end.

Excellent sauce! I only used 1/2 cup broth (made with Better than Bouillon but same amount of wine and it reduced just fine without using cornstarch/water in about 25 mins. I’m not a fan of bay leaf so left that out, still delicious.

Superb.  Complex and flavorful, even when I reduced the butter by half.  Unlike another reviewer, I  actually found the cornstarch as a necessary ingredient in order to thicken the consistency.  Highly recommend.

This recipe is so good that my husband made extra at 9:00 the same night , and I think he actually used bread to mop up whatever was left in the pan!  We did not use the wine, or any substitute for it, nor the basil leaves.  Otherwise, made as written and it turned out fantastic!!!  Put over grilled ribeyes.

This is a surprisingly easy recipe to yield such deep flavor. Definitely a keeper.  I make a lot of dishes from Cooks Illustrated  which are always excellent but  very time-consuming so this is a welcome addition to my recipe files.

I also have a friend who was owner & chef at one of the most loved resturants in Eureka Springs Arkansas. All he'd give me was a name.  One of his specializes was a dish he called "chicken gizmondo".  It was aflatted chichen breast lightly breaded pan sauteed in butter placed on a bed of spinach and then the sauce on top oh my gosh and served it with near East Rice pilaf and my kids just loved it course I did too

Made this recipe nearly exactly as the recipe called for and it was amazing! I did double everything so there would be lots to put on our mashed potatoes too. I added more Worcestershire sauce just because I like that, but other than that no other changes. We had made fillet the night before and had leftovers. So I sliced it up and put some olive oil in a pan to warm it up and paired with this sauce it was simply fantastic. I honestly didn't know what type of wine to use (I'm not a huge wine drinker) so I bought Apothic Red. Worked for us and the sauce was rich and amazing. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Doubled the recipe, used white and portabella mushrooms,  used sweet onion instead of shallots,  and served over schnitzel.  Fantastic!

It's fabulous with red meat, and not so bad on top of a chicken schnitzel either! I found that the cornstarch wasn't necessary, I just cooked it down until it was right.

Fabulous!!!  Paula Deen would approve - with that much butter.  Perfect for steaks, nice beef, or burgers!  This is DEFINITELY being added to our rotation.  My daugher will soon be adding this to her own favorites cookbook as well.

Excellent Sauce, even though we are NOT fans of mushrooms. I simply omitted the mushrooms all together and came up with a beautiful, flavorful sauce, that went wonderful on some Prime Grade Filet Mignon. I used the "Chateaubriand" recipe from this site and everything was exquisite. I chose to season the Filet with personal spices and took advice from another comment to add much more butter during the cooking phase. I basted the Filets while cooking and the results were incredible! I transferred some of the drippings from the Filet Pan to the sauce pan while softening the garlic and shallot. Since I omitted the mushrooms, I added additional butter and broth to the pan. We love fresh Thyme, so additional was in order. When the recipe had reduced and thickened, I decided to strain through a fine metal mesh, leaving nothing but a wonderful deep brown sauce. My family is still raving about this dinner and my 14 y.o. son learned to make a wonderful sauce. Proud Dad moment.

I had a bordelaise gravy at our favorite restaurant and wanted to find a recipe for it I liked it so much.  This is now my favorite and go to gravy. My family loves it! It takes a little preparation and time but you can make it then let it sit on warm until everything else is ready . I think it's kinda fun to make though. Delicious! !!! Deserves more stars! 
Tip: if you don't have red wine you can use red wine vinegar. If it tastes too acidic just add a sprinkling of baking soda to the gravy and stir until all the foam is gone. Tastes identical! Also this recipe only feeds 2-3, you will need to double it to feed 4 people.

Was making this for roast chicken breast and only had white wine. Added approx 2 tbsp soy sauce to battle the added sweetness and used veggie broth vice beef, worked great. Thanks!

Had guests for dinner and hubby wanted to do steak on the grill. i don't eat red meat so i couldn't taste the sauce but my hubby and friends ate it all and loved it! I used flour instead of cornstarch. Make sure you allow an hour for the process as you want enough time to simmer the sauce to the correct consistency.

I made this tonight for myself and my fiancé. It was absolutely delicious. I served it over medium tenderloin steaks and my own garlic and Gouda mashed potatoes. Absolutely fabulous. My fiancé had thirds he liked it so much, and is currently lying on the couch in a food coma. I will make this often for guests and special occasions.

Pretty tasty although I personally will reduce the amount of corn starch in the future. I like my sauces for good meat to be a little less "sticky". Would be excellent on a burger however. Thanks so much for sharing!

Very tasty, however when you are adjusting the serving, not all ingredients get adjusted ie the corn starch amount stays the same and ruins the recipe.

Finally mushrooms that are so flavorful but do not detract from the main course. I agree with the comment that you do not need the cornstarch just some patience to let it reduce to the consistency you desire. I used crimini mushrooms but I am sure any blend or type would taste great. Thank you!!

This sauce was amazing! I doubled it, but had some leftover, so I added a bit of cream and more red wine to it the next day and had it over tenderloin and dipped artisan bread into it. Both ways were so good. I did not have shallots, thyme, or red wine on hand, so I used sweet onion (diced), oregano (suggested as a replacement for thyme) and the white wine I had on hand. To be so good, even with replacements, really speaks well of the recipe. This is a keeper!

Absent bone marrow this is a good sauce. I would suggest using a dark roux over the corn starch. Yes, corn starch is easier but the flavor is greatly enhanced with a roux.

So tasty! Really easy to make and it tastes like mushroomy heaven. I used red onions to add a little sweetness. Makes a great change from creamy mushroom sauces or gravy on meat or mashed potatoes.

I served this sauce over pan seared sirloin steaks and my whole family loved it.  Instantly made Sunday night dinner a gourmet celebration.  Was not very difficult to make and I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I will definitly be making this again!
