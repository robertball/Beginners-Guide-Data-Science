This is pretty basic - let's face it, it's just noodles, sauce, and cheese. Your average college student can do this. However, classics are classics for a reason, and this was tasty and easy. No complaints from me or my fiancee. Changes I made: I added 2 big cloves of crushed garlic to the sausage while it was cooking, some dried basil to the sauce, used a six-cheese sauce, used more sauce than called for (1 big jar), added grated fresh parmesan to the mozzarella on top, and used half gnocchi and half cheese tortellini. A quick, tasty, throw-together meal - I won't keep the recipe on hand because come on, you make this once, you have it memorized. But I'll remember it for busy weeknight dinners in the future.

This was a nice change of pace.  I made a "garlic bread topping" By toasting some bread, and throwing it in the food proccessor with  little bit of melted butter, garlic, parmesan chese, and parsley. Threw it under the broiler at the end, Yum!

I misread the recipe & only used 8 oz. gnocchi, but still added almost double the sauce. We just like our baked pasta saucy. I used a Italian 4 cheese blend & 1 jar each Classico Roasted Garlic & Spicy Red Pepper. It gave it just the slightest bite, but wasn't too hot for my 10 year old. This recipe was so simple, but really, really good. We all ate until we were stuffed, so this is definately going into rotation. Thanks!

Soooo easy. I'm Italian and this is good.  Only substitutions I made was I added 5 cloves minced garlic to the sausage as it was browning. I used 2 cups mozzarella instead of 1 1/2 and also I used my own homemade marinara sauce.

This would be a great dish for company.  Your whole family should enjoy this one.

This was pretty good, and very quick and easy!  I used Trader Joe's gnocchi, and was going to use their pasta sauce also, but I couldn't get the darn jar open!  Lol!  And no one was here to help me, so I made my own sauce using a 14 oz. can of Italian tomatoes and an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  It worked great.  I used 1/2 lb. sausage.  I also added some fresh garlic, Italian Seasonings, and parm cheese to it.  I used Tillamook's Tuscan Blend shredded cheese, just on top.  I will make this again.

I think whoever makes this better really enjoy gnocchi, because it is very "gummy", and chewy mixed in with all the cheese.. after a few bites, everyone became very full, and the texture was unpleasent, we were picking out and eating the sausage only and leaving the cheese and gnocchi. I think gnocchi only needs a simple sauce and a light spinkle of parm. However my 13 month old really enjoyed it.

Didn't have any italian sausage or spaghetti sauce. Did saute a package of Geneoa salami, can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic, handful of fresh oregano, basil and margoram, big diced onion fresh garlic and shallots.  With the mozarella and slivered parmesan to top this made a scrumptious skillet dish.  So good with many wonderful textures and melting flavors.

This was easy and excellent! I only used 2/3 jar of tomato sauce, and used Trader Joe's whole wheat gnocchi (you can't tell the difference!). Also we used sweet chicken italian sausage links, sliced, and also added  one small diced red pepper and some sliced mushrooms. It was fantastic!

This recipie was outstanding!  I made a couple changes based on suggestions.  Used 1.5lbs spicy Italian sausage and chopped some sweet onions and garlic that I sauteed with the sausage.  I also added some tomato paste to the spaghetti sauce.  Letting this sit in the fridge before popping it in the oven helped all the flavors combine.  I'll be making this again!

This is a fantastic easy recipe. I like the idea of buying already made gnocchi rather than taking the time to make them. Not all recipes need to be types where you make every ingredient. This was easy to make and had great flavor. I added some garlic powder and basil to the mixture once all combined. I also made this ahead of when I needed and put in the refrigerator then finished baking. I increased baking time 15 minutes.

Thick and bland.  It'd be OK in a pinch, but even with more garlic or onion, the cheese and gnocci are just too gummy together.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! This was my first time cooking gnocchi, and thought this looked good.  Was it ever!  I tasted the gnocchi after cooking it, and was surprised at how bland it was.  I was hoping it wouldn't be so bland after I mixed it with the sauce and cheese and sausage.  It turned out brilliantly! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

It is silly how good this is.  I used Bob Evans Premium Cuts Italian Sausage, Parmesan & Romano Robusto Ragu, regular old gnocchi and 3 cups of mozzarella - ridiculous....outstanding.

This Gnocchi Bake is outstanding!  I love gnocchi so when I saw this recipe I had to make it.  Me, my husband and 4 of our kids who ate it loved it!  Delicious and easy.  I wouldn't change a thing.

absolutely fabulous!!!  My husband raved and raved about this.  He even suggested that I put this into our regular rotation.  The only thing I did different was to add 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning with the sauce.  The ghocchi turned out tender and perfect!!!  Thank you so much for such a simple but fabulous recipe!

I added a small bunch of kale (chopped), a red pepper and an onion (softened in the pan).  I didn't pre-cook the sausage, but added it with the spaghetti sauce and above ingredients to the slow cooker for several hours.  Then followed the instructions to prepare for baking.  Four of us feasted on it, and there was some leftover for my son to take to work.  
Delicious!

Fantastic and simple recipe.  I used a full jar of spaghetti sauce (garlic & onion) AND a 1/2 jar of light alfredo sauce.  OMG, the flavor was wonderful.  Will definitely make again very soon.

I am not going to say this is the most amazing meal and you must try, from the list of ingredients and the simplicity of this recipe you know that will not be true, but it’s a good base if like me you have ingredients that need using up and rather short of time.  I followed the recipe exactly only adding mushrooms and onions to the skillet when cooking the sausage, glad I did for the extra flavor and texture.  My Gnocchi was cooked to perfection and the meal was ok, nothing spectacular.  Not sure its something I would make again in a hurry, if I did I think I would use mature cheddar cheese instead of Mozzarella for extra taste.

This has become a household favorite. I'd say we eat it 1-2 times a month. I doubled the amount of gnocchi because I thought it needed more pasta the first time. After that it was perfect. As far as sauce goes, I use Gia Russa Marinara (it's the best.. try this recipe again with it and you'll see what a difference it makes!)

This is one of my go to meals.  It is easy and can be made in a few minutes.  I make it with Turkey Sausage and Whole Wheat Gnocchi and you can't tell the difference but we get more fiber in our diet with the whole wheat.

I am a Gnocchi addict, I just love those little balls of dough!  This was a quick and easy recipe to put together!  Not my absolute favorite way but it was pretty yummy, I will probably make again.  I didn't have any Italian sausage but I used Spagetti sauce with Italian sausage in it.  I cooked the gnocchi, drained, tossed with the sauce placed in a casserole dish, topped with grated parmesan cheese and then lots of grated Jack cheese.  It was pretty tasty concidering how simple it was to throw together!  Thanks for sharing this simple dish!

This recipe is 4.5 out of 5 stars... what makes it 5... is substituting penne noodles for the gnocchi and adding sauted mushrooms in garlic butter.  A definite keeper!  I also added parmesan cheese to the mix.

This perfect as is.  I have made it three times already and every time it is sooo good.  This is a winner. I used my home made sauce that has a lot of garlic in it so if yours doesn't I would suggest adding some.  Give this a shot - it is yummy!

Very nice dish.  I didn't think it was gummy or too cheesy at all.  Make sure you cook the gnocchi as directed; if you cook it too long, it will become gooey or mushy.  It's done when it floats to the top--most of the pasta will be done all at the same time, I promise.  I thought this was a bit heavy, but you could elimate the sausage to lighten it a tad.  The gnocchi definitely makes it filling!  We both gobbled this up and enjoyed the leftovers as well. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very easy recipe to make, but it was a little simple and not much flavor.

Eh. This was mediocre at best. I have to laugh... this really isn't a recipe at all. Just about every cook has made this or something similar, whether following a "recipe" or not. On the flipside, I must say this is perfect for us working folks (it really IS that easy to throw together!). For me, the gnocchi was the deal breaker. It is far too heavy for a gooey, cheese-laden baked dish. Penne or rotini would be a better choice, IMHO. Maybe this will float your boat, but it just didn't mine. Thanks anyways, andrea_d! :)

10-12-11 Tonight I made this a WHITE GNOCCHI BAKE by using light alfredo sauce and sun dried tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and the creamed spinach I added last time.  It was so creamy and delicious!!    11-2-10  I totally tweaked this recipe to what I had on hand, but it's still an awesome recipe - - a great base to build on.  I used cooked chicken instead of the sausage, and added chopped onion, minced garlic, a box of cooked creamed spinach, and a dash of nutmeg.  The spinach added richness and a pretty color to the dish.  This was SO simple, yet tasted wonderful.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, WannaBeChef.  We'll be having this over and over again.

Fast, easy, and a great family meal.  I used the Versatile Sauce for this.  My family loved it.  I also made my own Gnocchi instead of buying frozen.

This was pretty good, but I did change the recipe slightly.  I sauteed 1 medium onion and 3 cloves of garlic with the sausage.  I also cut the amount of sausage down to 1/2 pound and we thought it was perfect this way.  In the end, this casserole was very quick and easy to put together and we will make it again for sure.

Very easy recipe to make.  I really enjoyed it.  Next time I will probably add a bit of garlic.  I really enjoyed the sausage because I get tired of having ground beef all the time.  I will definitely make this again.

This is very good but because Gnocchi are so heavy to begin with and gummy if overcooked I added some ricotta cheese over the gnocchi and then added the mozzarella and extra sauce. I also season the ricotta before doing this with parsley, grated parmeson cheese, salt, pepper and an egg.  Mix well and spoon right on top of the gnocchi..Delicious but gnocchi are my favorite macaroni!!!

I substituted cheese ravioli for the gnocchi (none in the supermarket!) and made the Italian sausage into tiny meatballs.  Excellent.  Will be trying it again with gnoochi if I can find it.

We enjoyed but the kids decided that they are not big on Italian sausage by itself.  Next time I will use ground beef or mix Italian and ground beef together.  (family preference).  Using Gnocchi was nice for something different.  Will make again.  Thanks

Good recipe.  The thing I like most about it is the fact that its so simple, and easy to manipulate. Originally, I used all recommended ingredients.  I am excited to try it with different sausages, chicken, ground beef, and/or veggies (like peas or spinach).

This was really good and so easy to make. We added roasted onions and garlic and subsituted velveta for the mozzarella as that was the only cheese in the fridge. Came out very well. My boyfriend requested the recipe, which is always a good sign :)

I was looking to do something different with gnocchi's then just throwing gravy or butter on them and this is pretty good.  I also used TraderJoes Gnocchi's but since others said kinda bland I used Trader Joes Roasted Red Pepper Sauce instead of regular spaghetti sauce plus low fat ground sausage and light mozzarella.  Turned out actually quite spicy. My 3yr old wouldnt eat but we liked.  Next time I think I'll tone it down a bit but if you want a kick try The Trader Joes sauce

Granted, this is very basic, but it still gave me an idea for the gnocchi in my pantry. I had never thought to use it in a casserole. I halved the recipe because I had 1/2 lb. of sausage and there are only two of us. It would have been delicious as is, but I had some leftover eggplant, a zucchini and a couple of mushrooms I needed to use, so I diced the eggplant and zucchini and sliced the mushrooms. After sauteeing some chopped onions in a bit of olive oil, I added and browned the sausage, removed it from the skillet and added the remaining veggies with a chopped garlic clove. When they were done,I proceeded with the recipe as written. I did add a bit of parmesan on top with the mozzarella. Great comfort food. Also a way to use any veggies you have to make a one dish meal.

This is a good base recipe for a basic yummy raindy-day dish.  Like others, I added a bit -- used chorizo sausage, finely chopped onion, chopped garlic and, to avoid the gumm-iness of the gnocchi, I parboiled first then pan fried in butter and basil.

This is such a delicious recipe, everyone I made it for adored it.  I used fresh whole grain gnocchi, which gave it a delicious earthy taste, vegetarian sausage, and provolone cheese instead of mozzarella cheese because I didn't have any mozzarella in my fridge.  I also cooked up some onions in the skillet before I added the veggie sausage and added a hit of dried oregano, basil, and red chili flakes to the mix for extra flavor.  Wonderful vegetarian recipe and my boyfriend couldn't tell it wasn't real meat.  I highly recommend it.

Made this using the Quick Gnocchi recipe on this site last night. It was the perfect amount for this recipe. I had 2 cups of Mozzerella cheese and used the whole bag. I had Hot Itallian sausage and used it as it was what was on hand, but will use mild or sweet next time. This was VERY GOOD and I can't wait to cook it the next time we have company over!

Delicious.  I used Rinaldi meat sauce-1/2 hot & 1/2 mild Italian sausage-added 2 bay leaves-minced garlic-fresh mushrooms-1 can of well drained spinach & some red pepper flakes.  I let this simmer for a while for a little more flavor.  It did thicken up a little so I added some of the gnocchi water to thin it.  I've had many requests for the recipe.  Try it you'll like it.  Thanks Andrea!

Three stars because the cooking time is way off, the flavor was probably 4 stars though.  My package of gnocchi said to only cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, only until it floated to the top.  I did that heated the sauce through in the sausage, melted the cheese in, and the added the gnocchi.  I baked only for five minutes, just long enough for the cheese on top to melt.  I couldn't see baking it for 20 minutes when everything in it was already cooked.  My intuition was right, the gnocchi came out the perfect consistency and everything was hot though.  I also used a 24 oz. jar of sauce because it's what I had and I don't mind a little extra sauce, a 20 oz. jar would have probably been perfect.    Next time I think I was use all or half ground turkey, I'm not a big sausage fan and the flavor was a bit overpowering.

sylvia back in 06 suggested the salami, garlic and onion version. It is nothing like this version but her ideas were great to change this recipe up.

This is the first time I've ever had gnocchi. I couldn't find frozen gnocchi at the store in my southern town, so I made it from scratch before adding it to this recipe. It turned okay --wasn't bad at all, just not something that I'll make again.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  Because I only had a half pound of sausage on hand, I added in sliced mushrooms and chopped onions when browning the sausage.  The family really liked it.

Made this recipe exactly as stated, eventhough I used sliced italian sausage links.  The family loved it.  I make so many new recipes, the family knows if they want it again they have to tell me its a keeper, which most of them are, including this one.

Excellent idea! I sauteed onion, garlic, and mushrooms in EVOO and added to the sauce before mixing. It was an easy and yummy dinner!

My husband and I have made this one of our regular meals.  It is so easy to do, I can even make it (I am not the primary meal maker).  The only thing we add is garlic!  Thank you for this recipe!!!

This was a great, great meal! Quick, easy, delicious. I used Chicken Sausage from Trader Joes to make it a little lighter. One change I would make is increase the cheese amount to 1-1/2 cups. I will be making this all the time!

This was my first gnocchi experience, and it was great!  I give the taste 4 stars, but the simplicity of it is hard to beat, it's easy as can be to make, and it's unique... so I'm rounding up to 5 based on all the factors :)
Thanks!  We'll be doing this again!

I agree that the recipe was a little bland, but the hubby likes it that way!  I did add fresh garlic, onion powder, and italian seasonings and that added a little more flavor to it.  I also used ground beef as sausage tends to be a little too much for me.  My hubby says he will definately want this one again.

I was courious about this recipe and the Gnocchi.  Unfortunatly I not too impressed with it.  The Sausage and sauce were good along with the cheese but I think I will stick with pasta nuggets to the same out come.  The Gnocchi was gummy and did not have a lot of flavor.

I made this using homemade sauce with a sweet basil flavor and no sausage.  Rather, I cooked turkey sausage, onions and peppers and served that on the side.  I mixed the gnocchi with the sauce and put it in one layer in a large casserole dish.  I cooked it in the oven until very hot and bubbly, then added about 1 c. of mozzarella.  It was delicious!  (I could tell that it would be terrific with the sausage in the dish just by eating the two dishes together.)  Thanks!  This will become a favorite way to serve gnocchi (a pasta I'm not fond of).  I'm going to give this 5 stars even if I didn't follow the receipe to a T.

Good recipe. Next time I make it I will probably use a spicier sausage; I used a sweet Italian sausage and it made the entire dish too sweet.

Very good.  Those that had mushy gnocci must have overcooked it.  I did add and extra jar of spaghetti sauce on top before topping with the cheese.  We like our dishes very moist.

This was yummy.  As with any tomato sauce based dish, the sauce you use makes all the difference.  I highly recommend using the spaghetti sauce from the 'Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs' recipe on this website.  My favorite.  Also, I didn't like the texture of having the cheese baked into the dish - it came out a little hard and stringy.  Next time I make this, I will only put cheese on top :)  Enjoy!

Very easy to put together. Nice simple dinner with a salad and some nice fresh bread. I used 2 sweet Italian and 1 hot Italian sausage. Next time I will use all hot - just to give it a bit more interest. Very kid friendly.

I like this one, though my family thought that it was a little spicy.  I used Chorizo sausages and spaghetti instead of the gnocchi, as that is what I had at home.  But it was still delicious, and will make again.

I made this last night but used ground beef because that's just what I had on hand.  Family loved it.  Added a little shredded parmesan in with the mozzarella cheese to make it extra cheesy.  Will make again.  It's easy and was enough for some leftovers.

I guess I am your "average college student."
first off, I don't cook. Its just not something that I'm spectacular at. 
second off, THIS IS AMAZING.
went to Aldi and spent a whole 13 bucks to make this. Makes just enough for me and my fiance and then for me to have lunch the next day. 
If you're on a budget, this is the way to go. Its quick and easy. Longest part was waiting for the italian sausage to cook. I kind of ignore measuring the cheese I put enough for it to be SUPER cheesy, then I put sliced mozzarella on top while its baking to have a nice baked top on it, kinda like lasagna. 
Overall, this is fantastic. 2nd time making it right now! YUMMM!

Yummy!  I did like a previous reviewer and used half gnocchi and half tortellini.  I didn't add any meat.  I added some sliced black olives and I cut up some artichoke hearts and added to the sauce.  It was very easy - I used canned spaghetti sauce.  I served with garlic bread.  Everyone loved it.

All of the ingredients on this sounded great. But mixed together forget it. Maybe I had bad gnocchi, but I would have rather had noodles in this.

I changed this recipe quite a bit and ended up making it vegetarian.  I took out the italian sausage, because I didn't have any on hand, and added some leftover homade pasta sauce (garlic, onion, mushrooms, and zuchinni, tomatoe sauce, spices).  I also added a small zuchinni to make up for the lack of sausage.  Tasted great.

Fantastic and will definately make again!  I will probably double the batch next time because we ate it until we were uncomfortably full and argued over who got the leftovers.... haha.  I did add 1 can of drained diced tomatoes, a small dash of Italian Seasonings, 1 onion, and 1 tbsp of diced garlic.  The onion and garlic was cooked with the Italian Sausage, the diced tomatoes were mixed with the sauce, and I used just a small amount of Italian seasoning with the tomatoes.

Quick, easy and tasty! Added some ricotta/carrot/herb mixture to the sauce, which was leftover from making stuffed mini peppers - it made it just that much more creamy and delicious. My wife took it to work the next day for lunch and said it was just as good leftover. We will definitely be having this again.

The whole family loved it! Super easy to make. I made it with Chicken sausage and lowfat mazzerella cheese just to shave off a few calories and it was still delicious!

This is a wonderful simple dish, a little too saucy for me.  So next time I will either add more gnocchi or use less sauce.  Definitely season to your taste with garlic, basil, or whatever you happen to have on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

We used alfredo instead of a tomato based sauce, and no cheese. Also skipped the baking step. Tasty! My husband and toddler loved it, too!

This is a great basic recipe and fun and easy to adapt. I used an Italian four cheese blend instead of mozzarella and a vodka sauce instead of regular spaghetti sauce and it was amazing. I love gnocchi. I used a premade gnocchi but next time I'll use fresh made.

If you love quick, easy and tasty, you'll enjoy this one.  I didn't have any italian sausage on hand.  I substituted breadfast sausage with good results.  I used Kraft Italian 4 cheese mixture.  Will make this one again.

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious.  I did tweak it a tiny bit by adding fresh garlic to the sausage as I fried it, as well as fresh red pepper flakes.  So good.  Will definitely make again on a cold winter night.  Very filling too!

This is our favorite gnocchi recipe! I actually use smoked sausage links (1 lb.), 26 oz. spaghetti sauce, 4 oz. cheese, and 1 lb. gnocchi! It is outstanding. Thanks for sharing :)

Tasty and quick! Added onion and garlic to the sausage. I was also careful to get all the fat I could out of the sausage and cut back on the cheese to make it healthier.

I made this last night and I think it was really good! I added more cheese and it was excellent, my hubby liked it and he usually finds something to complain about when I cook.. LOL...Although he did say maybe more meat next time but other than that no real complaints… I doubled the recipe because my family of 4 can devour food! I ended up having enough left for lunch for my hubby and myself, I made garlic bread for a side and it was OH-SO-YUMMY! It is simple and doesn't take very much time at all. While this was my first time making gnocchi I find the key to not having "gummy" gnocchi is to cook for the right amount of time, I cooked it for about 6 minutes and the gnocchi was floating at the top of the pot by that time, so I would say that if it is floating it is done. I don't think this would be a very good vegetarian dish because a lot of the flavor comes from the Italian sausage… I will be making this again, Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Very good!  I used a store brand Italian cheese blend, and a 28oz jar of spaghetti sauce, otherwise no changes.  I followed the recipe instructions and this was a quick and easy dinner.  I baked the mixture for 15 min and the cheese was plenty melty w/o being hard around the edges.  Served w/ cesar salad and crusty garlic bread. Yum!

I was looking for something different to do with gnocchi and this was great.  I added a 26 oz can of sauce and put some mushrooms in while it was simmering.  I will definitely be making this again because it was so simple and we really liked it.

We had never had gnocchi before but had been curious to try it.  This recipe seemed like it would be perfect for gnocchi newbies so I gave it a whirl.  I used turkey Italian sausage because I prefer it.  And I’d meant to add some spinach because we both love it but forgot.  I guess that means we’ll just have to try it again!  I think my only complaint with this recipe was that I didn’t like what happened to the gnocchi when it was reheated for leftovers: it got mushy.  Maybe that’s just what happens to it in the microwave?  I guess I’m not sure, but I think the next time I make this dish I will make sure we have enough people to finish it so there won’t be any leftovers.

I really enjoyed this meal. I used Hot Turkey Sausage and it tasted great and it was healthier! My Boyfriend loved it. I think I had 1 bowl and he ate the rest of the cassarole dish. I would defiently cook again.

I made this for supper tonight using the "Bold" Jimmy Dean sausage and it was very good. I didn't use Italian sausage because I don't care for the flavor. It was quick and easy and, most importantly, my daughter and I both really loved it. Definitely one for the rotation!

Loved this recipe. I typed "gnocchi" into Allrecipe's search engine and this recipe had all of the ingredients that I had on hand. I guess I should clarify that though, I didn't have  the spaghetti sauce, so I made my own using tomato sauce, Italian seasonings, garlic and minced onions.  What a nice, easy and tasty recipe!

We loved this.  I found all the ingredients at Trader Joes on my way home from work and it was ready to eat in 45 minutes.  I found that it needed about 30 minutes in the oven.  I ended up cutting Italian chicken sausage links into 1/2 moons instead of using bulk sausage.  Turned out great!

Now this is an Italian meal even my Irish husband can make. Although I may be Italian myself, I am no Giada De Laurentiis in the kitchen.
Just a side note, tastes just as good when not baked.

I actually found this receipe on here for a co-worker to bring in for our potluck. She made it and said it was really easy to make I think the only thing she changed was she got wheat gnocchi at a speciality shop. It was SOOOO good I had made lasagna which everyone usually devours and hers got eaten before mine and I found her the recipe! :) It's definatley a keeper and very yummy!

I needed a vegetarian dish for a guest we recently entertained.  I omitted the meat and added in some sauteed peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  He loved  it and so did my family.

This was ok but too greasy with all the cheese and sausage.If I make this again I'll use a low fat cheese and a lean sausage,might help.

This was delicious. I also added some garlic to the casserole before I baked it, and the sauce I used had basil in it, so I didn't need to add any extra spices. Very good!

I rarely make a recipe more than once, but this casserole is an exception.  I make it with turkey italian sausage and reduced fat mozzarella, and it's one of my family's favorite meals.

Using hot Italian sausage this was yummy.  Easy to make the day before and then just pop in the oven for supper. If the gnocchi was mushy or gummy, guys, you overcooked it.  Not the gnocchis fault!!! I did use about 16 oz of sauce because it looked a hair dry.

This was a great recipe.  I used fresh mozzarella because that was the option at the store.  It was good, but VERY stringy and hard to work with.  I'll use regular next time.  I took the main advice and sauteed the sausage (lamb with apples, garlic and rosemary, fabulous) with a shallot and some garlic.  I also shredded some fresh parm over the top and sprinkled a little italian seasoning.  Great!  Oh, and I barely boiled the gnocchi, so it was still quite firm.

Delicious, easy and quick! I substituted some lean ground beef for the sausage and it came out great! I made it for dinner last night and it was such a hit with my husband that I made another to take to a friend's house. Will put into regular rotation at our house!

This recipe was excellent!  My family is not a fan of gnocchi, but they loved this! Definately use Italian hot sausage, otherwise it will be bland.  Th hot sausage is not overpowering or overly spicy.

This is pretty darn good.  A twist on gnocchi that brings out a totally different flavor of sauce and the potato dumpling. My family really liked it.  I'd make it again, definately. It's good without sausage, too.

My son wanted to try gnocchi and I found this recipe while searching AR. It had ingredients we like and was super easy to make. Great recipe for a quick dinner, makes enough to feed a family of four and have leftovers. I followed the recipe as is until the end, and then I did broil on high for about five minutes to brown the cheese just a tad. Delicious dish that even a picky water should like.

It was alright, but super easy to make.

I am honestly not crazy about gnocchi,  though I tried it to use up some Italian sausage we had on hand. I added probably more sauce and a lot less cheese, plus fresh garlic I cooked with the sausage.

My family likes it, all except for our youngest child, who is extremely picky.

Very tasty. Added 2 cloves of garlic and some diced onion to the sausage meat, along with Italian seasoning and some freshly cracked pepper. Also added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese to the meat mixture instead of the mozzarella.  Topped with mozzarella prior to baking. Will def make again.

Used ground beef because that's what we had in the house, and some shredded fresh basil, and everything was delicious!  Super simple weekday dish with the benefits of leftovers.  Even my 18 month old liked it.

Simple and tasty. What more could one want? I did add a step by pan-frying the gnocchi in some butter after they were par-boiled which added to the overall flavour of the dish, and I used my homemade pasta sauce because it's cheaper, easy and tastes better than the store stuff, but other than that made this as per the recipe. Both my girls loved it, as well as the hubby. Will make again next time I want gnocchi.

I used hot Italian sausage and vodka spaghetti sauce. Used about 2+ cups of mozzarella cheese. I made this ahead of when I needed and put in the refrigerator then reheated, covered, in the oven.  Very tasty.  Very filling.

This is a super easy, very satisfying meal. I made a tossed salad and garlic bread to go with it. I happened to have some Italian sausage, I had precooked, in the freezer and some Trader Joe's gnocchi and some inexpensive pasta sauce and shredded Mozzarella. It was awesome and easy!

Delicious and easy! I didn't change a thing. For the sauce, I used some homemade sauce that I had leftover. It has lots of garlic, olive oil and parsley so if you use store-bought sauce you might want to add some garlic when you brown the sausage.

Okay so this recipe was good. Wasnt the best but I think that was partly my fault and my improvising. I didnt have sausage and the only meat I had thawed was turkey bacon (which smelled and tasted weird, even for turkey bacon....old maybe?) and I used 24 oz. sauce, also. I used a little more cheese and then we all put some more on top after we got our plates (we are cheese lovers). All in all it was a good meal, but I know it would be a great one if I had used sausage (or even chicken). I would never recommend turkey bacon (or at least that package I had). 

p.s. It was very filling. One plate and we were full.

p.p.s I used salt, pepper and oregano, which was awesome!

Super easy and great. Let's face it, we don't always have time to spend hours in the kitchen.  I used Mennonite sausage instead of Italian since I am Mennonite and it was great!  I also used the mini gnocchi but really liked it.  I sliced fresh mozzarella on top.

Great recipe!  I made a few modifications.  After reading a few comments, I thought the gnochi would be too heavy, so I used half gnochi and half tortellini.  I also added olives and cut back on the cheese just a bit.  I used Paul Newman's Own Roasted Garlic sauce.  I like my casseroles to be a little more moist, so I added about 3/4 cup of beef broth.  It turned out great.  Next time, I will probably add zuccini, which would be a nice light addition to the heavy meat and pasta flavors.

This recipe is great! We love cheese so we added more and realized that you need to add a full jar of sauce if you are going to have leftovers. Without the extra sauce, the bake gets too dry when you rewarm it in the oven. Also, we didn't know what kind of Italian sausage to buy, so we picked out the kind that looked like a braut, which doesn't chop well when you cook it on a pan! We will have to try this again either with sausage you find in a plastic tube or buying the same kind again and chopping them up into discs.

We'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars.  We bought some gnocchi in the pasta aisle.  Looked for recipes that would be good for kids and easy.  This fits the bill.  There are lots of ways to personalize it, but we stuck with the original recipe this time.  It didn't taste gummy to us.  We used Newman's Own pasta sauce.

I sliced pizza-brats we already had instead of using sausage, and sauteed the slices with onion and garlic while the gnocchi cooked. It turned out just great. Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!  Of course, I did make some changes according to what I had on had.  Boiled the gnocchi.  For the sauce, I had two cans of tomato sauce, 1 can of diced tomatoes.  I added dried herbs (basil, oregano, and parsley) and fresh garlic to the sauce and added frozen meatballs, as I didn't have any sausage.  Spooned some sauce on the bottom of the pan.  Then put down all the gnocchi in a single layer.  Then put down chopped up provolone cheese (deli style, cut up small).  Mixed about a half bad of fresh spinach into the sauce mixture and stir gently until it wilts.  Then spooned the meatball/spinach sauce mixture on top.  Sprinkled a little more provolone and some parmesan on top of the whole thing.  

The point is... this recipe is very easily adaptable to what you have on hand.  Delicious!  It's a keeper!

I thought this was great...my husband absolutely loved it! I added some diced onion to give it a little crunch, and sauteed it with the sausage so it didn't take any extra time. The leftovers were great when reheated also. Overall a very simple, good recipe!

this was my first time using gnocchi so i was somewhat apprehensive. it turned out pretty ok. instead of using italian sausage i just used italian seasoned ground turkey and added 2 cloves of minced garlic. my boyfriend liked it a lot more than I did but he likes anything with pasta sauce in it. The gnocchi was a little gummy but thats expected with the consistency of it. i used a lot lot lot of cheese within the mixture and on top so that was very good! all in all.. i will make this recipe again, definitely something different from the norm.

This is the best Gnocchi dish I have ever made. I wouldn't change a thing! We live in Italy and this is good enough to be put in a menu!! Delicious!

mixed reviews in my family on this.  I don't think my husband loved it and I don't think he hated it.  I have two toddlers who I thought would like it but was surprised my 3 yr old son didn't like it.  My 2 yr old daughter ate hers though.  I liked it.  I used regular pork sausage because I personally don't like italian sausage.  I used prepackaged gnochhi, fyi.  I boiled it for approx 6 min and it was perfect.  My husband and I both thought it could use more cheese and I already had used around 2 cups.

This was a huge hit with the family. My husband it is missing a little something but other than that it was great. We have small children and they eat it without complaint! I think the key is to not over cook the Gnocchi. I boiled mine for 5 minutes and baked for 15. We used prepackaged Gnocchi and not homemade (just FYI).

You definitely need to watch the cook time on the gnocchi! This was awesome! I think next time I will use less sausage and a tad more cheese. I used home made gravy which I think made it come out even better!

Five stars for taste and ease!  My husband liked it just the way it was but I may add a little more sauce next time.  I did use 2 cups of cheese.

This recipe is very good and so easy, you really don't need to keep the recipe.  The only change I made was to add a little bit of chopped garlic.  I made in advance and put in the fridge until ready to cook, which required a little bit longer heating time in the oven.  Yum!!!

I think this recipe's a great starting place!  I had to try it because my husband's such a gnocchi nut...  I threw in 1/2 lb italian sausage and a bit more cheese.  I'll definitely be making it again!

I made this without the sausage because I am a vegetarian. It wasn't the best, but it was simple to make. It seemed like I could just sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on the gnocchis when they were on my plate and get the same thing.

I made several changes to the recipe, but I think it would have been better if I had made it the recommended way.  I used pesto & cheese filled gnocchi from Trader Joe's.  I couldn't find gnocchi at any of the major supermarkets.  I made it with half a pound of ground Italian sausage and a full jar of spaghetti sauce that had Italian sausage in it.  I also added a 10 oz. box of frozen spinach which I thawed.  If I make this again, I'll follow the recipe.
