This is great! I married into an Italian family, and have always been lovingly teased about my use of 'canned' sauce. I decided to try this as my first attempt at 'home-made' sauce and invited the in-laws over for dinner (think Marie of Everybody Loves Raymond!) LOL! They were impressed and my kids gave it a 'two thumbs up'! The only difference is I used dried basil, added a bit of oregano, and a lil more garlic. This is super easy to make and even better.......it tastes great!

Very good, I use this recipe all the time but add 2 tbsp italian seasoning and 1 tsp oregano.  I usually double the recipe, add 1 12oz can of paste and 4 cups of water and let it cook down until slightly thickened.

This was a great change of pace recipe and quick to fix.  Will definately make this again.  Did not rate child reaction as I don't have any kids in the house anymore but imagine they would probably like it also.

This was good to make for a quick 30 minute sauce. I scaled this recipe down to 8 servings, used ground sage sausage and pureed my tomatoes (daughter doesn't like them).  I like adding a bay leaf for additional flavor too.

This is a 10+.  Added Italian seasoning and oregano - may added some hot red pepper flakes next time.  Really loved this one!!!

This sauce had too much acid in it.  It gave my husband and I heartburn.  I wanted to try something different than my own sauce, so I gave this a shot.  If you have acid reflux, put tb sugar or stick a carrot in to absorb some of the acid.  Sorry for the bad review.

This was excellent sauce. My kids don't like the chunks of tomatoes, so I used tomatoe sauce instead. No need to alter this recipe at all!

I used this sauce recipe for my lasagna so I modified a little bit because I wanted it really thick.  One of my cans of tomato sauce was also the kind with garlic and basil already added in and for the thickness I didn't add the water.  Added more oregeno to it too but otherwise it was one of the best sauces I made as my family usually likes Prego.

I made a version of this using mushrooms.  I made it over a campfire though so it was a little different.  Overall a GREAT recipe.

This is very similar to a the sauce I have made for years. Decided to try the recipe as made here for a change of pace. Not impressed, not enough spices, too much meat, and after cooking for 3 hours still too watery.  I sugest using crushed tomatoes instead of whole, less water, thicker sauce and you don't have to mess with crushing them.   I add about a tablespoon of oregano and crushed red peppers for more flavor.  I also add a can or tomato sauce instead of water, gives you a thicker sauce.  OK recipe as a base, but very easy to improve upon.

I have been with this site for two years now and NEVER have I felt compelled to give a recipe a bad review.  I'm very sorry for having to do that now,...  

DO NOT follow this recipe exactly and be ready to do many changes!  Way too much onions and garlic!  I'm really happy I altered it and did not lose my ingredients!

This sauce is great.  I added some mushrooms and a cup of canned tomato sauce instead of water.  Turned out great!

Almost perfect!  I halved the recipe but put a whole can of paste and about 3-4 tablespoons of oil. I think there is too much garlic (and I love garlic) and too much onion. In my half a recipe I would use only a quarter to half an onion and maybe 3-4 cloves of garlic. It was delicious anyway.

Made this while pregnant, froze it into serving-size portions, and have had MANY quick pasta dishes that taste like I simmered the sauce all day!  YUM!

Great recipe!  I didn't use the onion and instead of the tomato paste/tomatoes/water I used 2 jars of tomato sauce.  The sausage, basil, and garlic really play well together. YUMMY

Nice pasta dish but way too much oil.  I sauted my onion, garlic and one finely grated carrot (anyway to get extra nutrition into my finicky boys) in about 2 tbsps. of oil and 1 tbsp. of butter.  I also added 2 tsp. each of oregano and thyme and 1/3 c. of half and half for a sligtly rose type sauce.

This sauce is delicious.  I made it with venison sausage and added red crushed pepper. Every bite was absolutely amazing.

Very thin sauce and just wasn't to my families taste.  In our opinion - too salty, too runny and lacked depth of flavor.  Possible some more spices and only puree and not the actual diced tomatoes?  Hey, just one person's review - thanks for sharing.

This sauce was tasty and relatively quick to make.  I used half the amount of olive oil, substituted Han's Garlic and Fontina Chicken Sausage, and served with whole wheat pasta.  The fresh basil really makes this recipe!

This was excellent!  My husband was asking me to make something like this that he ate a lot as a kid.  Well it fit the bill!  He said it was wonderful.  The only thing I changed was that I sliced the sausage into 1 inch chunks because that's how my hubby likes it.  This is a keeper!

This was delicious!  I like that there a not that many ingredients.  I've always been "sauce" challenged, but this was great.  I just made a few changes:  I omitted the paste, used crushed tomatoes instead of whole peeled ones, and added just a touch of oregano.  Beautiful!

This was really good. In fact it may very well become my go to sauce recipe.  No fresh Basil int the fridge so I used the appropriate equivalent amount of Penzy's dried basil and a tablespoon of minced fresh parsley.  I used Hunt's tomatoes and Hunts tomato paste and good locally made Italian sausage.  This recipe needs nothing extra. I didn't need to add sugar, any other seasoning, and it did not even need the final slat and pepper. Good recipe...

It is SO oily. Guests are about to arrive and I'm scrambling around trying to find something to get the oil off the top. I even cooked the sausage separately and added it back in using a slotted spoon and it's still so greasy.
