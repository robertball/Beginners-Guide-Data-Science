6/15 Update - made this again yesterday. Split into 2 smaller pans so husband could give one away to coworker! I had exactly 8 cups of rhubarb but have used as much as 10 cups. My mother used to use less sugar because she liked it tart - I like it sweeter. Can omit cinnamon or add to egg mixture. This recipe is quite forgiving.

I fell in love with rhubarb custard pie (but I'm not a great pie crust maker) and have always loved an oatmeal crumble so this was a wonderful fit for my tastes.  I cut the recipe in half and used a round cake pan, lowered the sugar a little and felt it turned out great. Not overly sweet or tart.  There seemed to be a little more crust/topping than custard so next time I would like to lessen that and/or  maybe increase the custard (but it barely fit in the 9" pan).  It seems it would be great with a little flaked coconut in either the crust or the custard.  Great recipe for little work.   Really glad I found this.  Thanks kittymom for sharing.

I read reviews that stated it was missing something so I added a tsp of vanilla to the custard.  I would not make it again as written.  The crust and topping should be made with butter not shortening.   I should have seen that right off. We prefer things tart so I cut down on the sugar in both the custard and crust and it was plenty sweet enough.  I will look for  another recipe.

This had a dryish crust( and I actually put a bit extra butter). The custard layer was very 'eggy'

I thought this was good, but not outstanding as is.  It just needs a little something... Orange or lemon zest? Love the concept.  Maybe my rhubarb was sub-par.
