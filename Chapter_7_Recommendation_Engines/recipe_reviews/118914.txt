Just a note - If you can't find dried mint leaves, check in the ethnic foods aisle for Mexican spice "Yerba Buena", which means spearmint leaves.  I went to 3 stores before a clerk clued me in.  This spice mix is excellent in Greek Lemon Soup - also on this site.  A+++

I have been paying $6 a bottle for Greek Seasoning, but it was so good it was worth it!  I made this recipe & it tastes EXACTLY like the stuff I was buying.  It is GREAT!

This was really good.  I tossed come chicken with this seasoning, some lemon juice and olive oil.  I put on sticks and grilled.  It was easy and really good.  I did put the extra in an empty spice container for later.

This has a great flavor.  I sprinkle it on boneless skinless chicken tenders. Cook in olive oil until done. Put chicken on pita bread spread with hummus, add lettus, tomato, and cucumbers.  I drizzle greek salad dressing or balsamic vinigrette over the ingredients.  Wonderful!

This made some very flavorful ground turkey pitas, however, I had to add a LOT more garlic powder (didn't have the flakes).  I'm thinking next time I will just omit the garlic powder, and add 2 cloves of minced garlic to what I am cooking.  I just think fresh would go a lot farther than flakes or powder.  All in all though, this is the most authentic seasoning I have tried yet, so kudos to the creator!

This has richer flavor than purchased Greek Seasoning and think of the $$$ savings to make your own!  Make all of my own seasonings to eliminate sodium, but this one requires absolutely no alterations. Thank you for sharing!!!

wonderful! Used to make lamb skewers (2/3 seasoning put through grinder then added to 2# ground lamb +3 Tbsp lemon juice, set in fridge 8 hrs then skewer and grill) and it turned out fabulous! Tasted a lot like gyro meat!

This is EXCELLENT. I made about ten times the recipe and am planning to include this in foodie Christmas gift baskets, but I can't wait to play around with it myself - in vinaigrette, rubbed on meat a few hours before roasting, as a bread dipping oil... yum! Only change: used granulated dried garlic and onion powder instead of the minced.

I'm so excited to see this!  I've been using Cavander's, which tastes great, but it has MSG.  will definitely start making my own from now on.  Can't wait to try it out!

I did not have mint, but this is great on fresh green beans and a tbsp olive oil. 350 for 15 minutes, mixing once. Sprinkle a bit of grated Parmesan cheese. EXCELLENT! The 4 stars is because I have not tried it with the mint.

I used onion power and garlic powder instead of minced and added these spices to melted butter and oil to marinade my chicken in for chicken pitas.  It gave it a wonderful flavor!

I make my own seasoning mixtures to cut out the sodium.  I double the recipe and store the unused portion in a spice bottle.  This one is great on chicken, fish or vegetables.  I mix it exactly as described and sprinkle it on the chicken or fish.  Then saute in olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon.

This worked out fine for us. I used it on a smoked brisket and the flavor was complementary. The mint was a little too much for me but my husband never mentioned it.

I used this recipe as a step into what I was trying to accomplish with a cheese recipe. I will say thank you CindyLepp from the forum for recommending me this recipe. I made it to a T but minus'ed the mint. The herbs for what I was doing were bold and flavorful. Thank you. Next time I'll make this with the mint and use it to make something with Lamb.

This seasoning is great! I went to buy this in the store and didn't bother because it was loaded with sodium. So, I came home and found this recipe and had it done in about two minutes. I used it to make "feta and sun-dried tomato stuffed chicken (which is delicious too, by the way) and it used the whole recipe. Next time I'll make a larger batch so I have some lying around for other things. I bet it would go great on chicken or fish.

I used the seasoning on some grilled steak to make pita sandwiches.  It's probably not the most authentic greek meal, but for my first try, my husband absolutely loved it.

This is a really good seasoning blend, I use it as a rub or combine it with lemon juice, olive oil and water to make a marinade for chicken or beef kabobs. I've shared it with others who have also added it to their grill recipes.

Great recipe, the only change that I would make is to add a little lemon pepper. I used 1 tablespoon of this with fresh lemon juice and olive oil to marinate chicken strips, it was wonderful. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
