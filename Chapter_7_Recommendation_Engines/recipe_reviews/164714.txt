I made these like a billion times! They are delicious. Put some Coco Krispies in there too. They will be gone in a second.

Yep, these are brilliant!  That little extra bit of flavour the vanilla krispies contributes makes it just o grand...yum.  Will totally make these again!  I have a wheat allergy so these are a staple treat for me.

This is a recipe that can't go wrong, but I found it a bit messy.

This is my go to recipe for rice krispie bars.  I've used it more times than I can count.
