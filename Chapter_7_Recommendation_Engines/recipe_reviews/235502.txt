I made this almost as listed and my family enjoyed it.  The change I made was I added water to the mix as there was no juice and it would have burned without the moisture (by the time it was ready, the water was all gone).   Next time I will not use the oven and will make the meat/veggie mixture in the same pot I am going to put the beans/spices in.  The bacon never got crispy in the oven and it was just another pot to clean.  Also, I didn't have fresh bell pepper so used the tri color frozen peppers and I didn't have fresh jalapeno and used dried.

HOLY COW! What a surprise! I had not a clue I was eating a turkey 'till maiden aunt Bess told me that uncle Ken shot it fresh the very same afternoon! So zesty and translucent!

The bacon added a nice flavor. I added some more tomatoes because I prefer it that way, but it would have been fine without. Yummy!

Turkey + Bacon = awesome. Followed the recipe but added pineapples at the end and man that was tasty chili! The smell in the oven reminded me of pizza. Thanks so much for this recipe.

The bacon was a nice addition to the chili. I wasn't sure exactly how I was going to feel about the bacon but I am a bacon lover and Fiesta Dish user so I had to try this recipe and I am very glad I did.
