EXCELLENT!  Family loved it and will definitely make again!  Made a few adjustments:  used 4 cloves fresh garlic; 3 tbsp mayonnaise; 2 tbsp lemon juice; baked about 25 minutes before broiling.

Excellent. Very tasty. Thank you very much for this wonderful recipe. It was fast and simple to make. I made this two weeks ago and was rather apprehensive as to how it would turn out since it didn't look particularly appealing when the crumbs had browned sufficiently. But I was pleasantly surprised by how good it tasted though the lemon juice (2 tbsp) was a bit overpowering. Although I used 4 tbsp of mayonnaise, the mixture of bread crumbs was rather dry but very crunchy. I used plain bread crumbs since I didn't have herb seasonsed ones, 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a small onion. There weren't any leftovers. I made it again for tonight's dinner. This time I used 6 tbsp of mayonnaise, 1 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of dried dill to the bread crumbs and the result was excellent. The taste was just right and yes, no left overs. But I've discovered that on both ocassions, it took 30 minutes for the fish to cook at 350 degrees F.

WOW! Fantastic recipe! I found the bread crumb mixture was too dry with the 2T of mayo so I added a little more as well as 2 tablespoons of lemon juice as it added just the right flavour to the fish. I also had to bake it for 10 minutes longer than specified. Delicious will definately be my main salmon recipe!

My bf liked this recipe a lot, but I thought the breadcrumb crust was too dry.  It's possible that I didn't use enough mayonnaise.  Although I didn't care too much for the breadcrumbs, I did like the flavor of the mayonnaise and onions.  It tastes very similar to the sauce of seafood dynamite served in Japanese restaurants.

Very good recipe. I liked it because I had all the ingrediants on hand- used low-fat sour cream instead of the mayo, used fresh garlic instead of dried, added a 'touch'of cayenne for a bit of heat and a pinch of dried parsley flakes for a punch. Wonderful.

Not bad, if you are going too add lemon juice, don't add too much, I did and it overpowered the fish.  If I make this again I will not make that mistake again.

My family liked the salmon, but found the breadcrumb crust too dry and overpowering.  They actually removed it.  I follower your recipe exactly and it had such great reviews that I was disappointed when it did not make a hit with my family.  To be fair, I will try it again with a few changes.  I will, however, use the same ingredents listed in your recipe.  If you don't mind, I would like to review your recipe again.  Sincerely, Iret

This is one of the best salmon recipes I've tried.  All it needed was a wedge of lemon on the plate for a few squirts to give it just the right kick.  Loved the broiled crunchy topping.
Delicious!

Keeping in mind I was looking for a solution for preparing Yellowtail, I selected this recipe as I thought the ingredients would work. I didn't have the exact ingredients and substituted mustard seeds, ground in a mortar, and only 1/2 tsp. The result was excellent. I would note, though, if using other fish, to adjust the time according to the type of fish and the thickness. Generally, 10-12 minutes of oven time @ 350 degress for 1 inch of fish is sufficient (total cooking time, including the browning). After taking out the fish, let it stand 2 minutes. The fish will continue to cook itself, which is why you don't want to wait until it's cooked all the way through in the oven. If you do, tender fish such as Salmon, Yellowtail, Halibut, will become dryed out. Keep it moist and even fish-haters will eat it.

Made this exactly as the original recipe and the entire family LOVED it!  My salmon was a bit thicker than an inch on the end, so I added 4 minutes cooking time.  The topping turned out perfectly under the broiler for 4 minutes.

I made this for my son who caught his first King Salmon off the Coast of Astoria this summer. I followed the recipe as it reads, with the addition of a little cayenne, we like a little heat. Super recipe will make again

I prepared this for a group of 10 last night using 6 pounds of Chinook Salmon filets.  I also used Japanese Panko crumbs and chopped fresh garlic (I doubled up on that over the dried product).  It took approx. 30 minutes to bake at 350 degrees because my filets were about 1 3/4 inches thick.  I then browned it under the broiler for about 5 minutes. It stayed lovely & moist. It got rave reviews.  My company left with the leftovers and called this morning to report that they had a little of that as soon as they arrived home.

This was really excellent! I made it for 4 servings not 2 so i doubled everything, but used 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice, and I think that was plenty. I also used 4 cloves of garlic as others suggested, and found that i needed to almost triple the mayo. As far as the cook time thought I thought it was good. I baked it for 15 min before the broiling and it was really just about over cooked. I would not bake it for more than 10-12 minutes. thanks for the recipe it was delicious!

This was Excellent!  My fish guy at the grocery makes something vety similar to this, and my son loves it.  Now I can make it at home at a fraction of the cost.  I did make some changes--4 T. bottled garlic (we LOVE garlic), 4 T. mayo, and 2T. lemon juice went into the stuffing, along with a few shakes of Tobasco sauce. (I agree with another reviewer---why wold anyone use dried garlic in the first place?)  Next I'm going to try it on catfish fillets.

This is the perfect blend of flavor for this fish.  You don't want to mask the Salmon flavor, but enhance it.  I grew up in Alaska (home of the Salmon) and I'd watched my mother make this (or something similar) but could never find a recipe that tasted like she made it.  Well I've finally found it.  This was my favorite as a child and everytime I make this recipe my guest rave it. Hint: my son prefers it this way: Extra mayo, leave off the onions and mustard powder, add lemon juice.  Just a kid-friendly version.

This was excellent!  I did add in the minced garlic as we love garlic.  I also didn't have any lemon juice on hand so I substituted apple cider vinegar.  Turned out wonderful.  I only baked it, no broiling, it didn't really need it.

Like another reviewer said, it's like a gourmet fish stick!  Very nice flavor.  I used red onion and 1 clove fresh garlic.  The amount of topping was just right for 4 - 4 oz. salmon filets.  I did not mix the bread crumbs into the mayo mixture, instead I sprinkled it on top.  The texture was excellent.  I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes, skipping the broiling, and the bread crumbs browned very nicely.  I served it with rice pilaf, but this salmon would really go well with homeade mac-n-cheese.  That is what I will do next time!

THIS WAS A VERY TASTY WAY TO SERVE SALMON AND VERY EASY TO DO.  I DIDN'T HAVE SEASONED BREAD CRUMBS ON HAND SO I USED PLAIN BREAD CRUMBS AND IT WAS VERY GOOD.  THE TOPPING HAS SOME SEASONING IN IT ALREADY WITH THE ONIONS & MINCED GARLIC. I WILL DEFINITELY HAVE IT AGAIN.
THANKS.

This salmon turned out splendidly! I followed the recipe except that I used minced garlic and brown mustard in place of the powders. I added some Panko bread crumbs to the seasoned crumbs for bigger crunch. The mix seemed a bit dry and so I added a bit more mayo (lowfat) until it was the desired consistency. I squeezed some fresh lemon over the filets prior to putting the breading on. I baked them for 15 minutes but my family was too hungry to wait for me to pop the salmon under the broiler and so I skipped that step this time.   The crust was still nice and crunchy even without being broiled. The garlic and spices and the lemon all worked together well. Just a really nice change from my usual broiled salmon. My family liked it and we will have it made this way often.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.

This is mild-flavored and delicate. Although I usually prefer more crisp fish, this is a nice option. I did end up adding more salt than I started out with. Served with brown rice and sliced tomatoes sprinkled with Italian seasoning mix.

I halved the recipe and used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.  I increased the amount of Miracle Whip by about 1/2 tablespoon and used jarred minced refrigerated garlic instead of dried garlic but otherwised followed the original recipe.  I thought the flavor was quite tasty, but the fish was a little over-cooked.  I'm going to try it again and reduce the baking time by 3 or 4 minutes.  It's so easy to over-cook fish!  Thanks for an interesting way to cook salmon.

This is an excellent recipe for salmon! I used a whole side of salmon. The recipe was enough to cover it but not thickly. I had to use a lot more than 2 tbsp of mayo. Probably more like 4 tbsp's. I will definitly make this again!

Yes, it came out a little greasy, but we loved it.  We added some parmesan cheese and substituted onion powder for the onion.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I forgot to print it out, but the only change I made was using brown mustard instead of powder.  It turned out great!

The topping was very, very good; I will use it on other fish also.  However, I obviously didn't pay attention to others' reviews about baking it about 25-30 minutes!  Was frustrated 'cause everything else was getting cold by the time the fish was done!  My own fault so it gets 4 * anyway!

This is now one of my favorite recipes. If you are not crazy about the taste of salmon, using a stuffing mixture as the bread crumbs really masks the salmon flavor (though my family loves the recipe just the way it is).

Very good! The only thing I would change would be to use less bread crumbs - they over-whelmed the other flavors. My salmon steaks were pretty thick, so I baked them for about 20 mins. Great recipe. Thanks!

my husband went fishing for salmon this past couple of months and we dont know what other recipe there is for salmon aside from the basic salt, pepper, lemon  baked salmon. when i saw and tried this recipe, i tell you-it's amazingly flavorful, tasty and i will definitely serve this to guests for dinner or potluck at church. concerened about calories? try using light mayonaise. don't use salt anymore but try using regular bottled mustard instead.

This is one of my favorite salmon recipes.  I used low carb herb bread and added sage and thyme.  I also used minced fresh garlic rather than dried.  The result was terrific.  It did take closer to 30 min. to bake.

Great idea with minimal prep time.  I thought however, that the fish could have baked a little longer.

My family LOVED this. I had made my children something else because they had friends over and they didn't think they wanted salmon until they saw it. I used panko crumbs instead of the bread crumbs and used veganaise instead of mayo. I served it with whole grain jasmine rice and steamed asparagus-can't wait to make it again.

This was ok.  I liked the flavor a lot, but for 2 large salmon fillets this was just too much topping, and I even through a lot away.  The result was essentially a thin layer of soggy bread on the top of the salmon (even with about 7 minutes of broiling).  I think next time I will try spreading the wet ingredients on the fish and then just sprinkling on the bread crumbs to see how that would turn out.  Great flavor, but the texture was wrong for me.

I usually do a ginger/teriyaki glaze with salmon, but that gets predictable. This recipe provides a nice change-up with pleasing taste and texture. I have found I can get my honey to eat healthy if I find a way to work in bread crumbs; with this recipe he gets omega 3 fatty acids with the crunch he likes.

This was a fabulous recipe. After reading the other comments I decided to make the topping more moist by using 2 tsp of Dijon mustard rather than dry mustard. Great!

Once you master this recipe, you'll want it all the time. I found the topping to be too dry as well, but adding extra lemon juice until it was a nice consistency did the trick, plus the extra lemon flavor compliments the salmon beautifully.

Very tasty. I used dijon mustard instead of mustard powder and it worked well. I will definately use the stuffing again but I may try catfish or halibut next time.

I had thicker fillets so it took a lot longer to cook and the topping was dried out on the top.  I am not sure this fits with salmon either.  I would try this again but use a whitefish and use the topping as stuffing.

I loved this, as did the roommate I fed it to. He raved about how amazing it was. Used mustard, rather than powder, and just plain breadcrumbs with some seasonings added, but other than that stuck to the recipe. Awesome. Doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the salmon... it went very well with rice and veggies. Wouldn't change anything.

Great taste; we enjoyed it, however, had to bake it an extra 20 minutes because the center was still on the raw side.  I used dried minced onions, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic (from a jar) and light mayonnaise and they worked just fine.  Would make again.

Excellent!  This is now our favorite salmon recipe!  Note:  I didn't have bread crubms so I used fresh made and same with the dried garlic, I used fresh so I doubled both breadcubms and garlic.  Thank you darling husband, myself and even my 3 year old loved it!  Next time I'll make more so we'll have leftovers!

I found this amazingly easy and flavorful. The second time I made it I added some more mustard powder, and was less concerned about adding more mayonnaise to make the consistency "paste-like." Just as long as you can press it onto the fish, the topping tastes great, so there is no need for those extra mayonnaise calories.

This was excellent. I had realized that i was out of breadcrumbs so I used Mild Cheddar Saltines crushed finely, and actual mustard instead of powder. It was really great and my husband raved! Thanks LonBinder for sharing!

I used a fresh Wild Alaska Salmon fillet.  The topping has outstanding flavor from the dry mustard.  I added about 1tsp of Herbs de Provence to packaged Italian bread crumbs which worked very well also.  My family raved about this new salmon recipe.

This was so good. My husband and myself loved it.  I gave it 4 stars because the breadcrumbs were dry with the current recipe - as some of the other reviewers mentioned - but i did not take the suggestion of adding more mayo - instead i remedied this by melting some butter to moisten the bread crumbs.  Served the salmon with some brown rice and cooked spinach - a delicious meal.  My husband suggested to moisten the bread crumbs by adding an egg - kind of like what you would do with a tuna or salmon burger - i will try that next time.

My husband and I both liked this recipe.  I did add a third spoon of mayo and the breading was not dry at all.  I also used minced garlic rather than dried.  I enjoyed the flavor from the onion in the breading.

Great quick meal and it really made the salmon have a different and unique taste. However, the cook time that they put did not work for me, I needed to have it in the oven an extra 5 min. since the breading was still a little raw-looking. All together this was great.

I enjoyed the flavors in this dish much more than I thought I would. I was running a bit short on time, so rather than sauteing the onion and garlic I subbed onion and garlic powder. I also only had plain bread crumbs so I simply added a bit extra pepper, dried parsley flakes, and a little bit of cayenne pepper. I did add a couple tablespoons of lemon juice too. Hubby wished this had been spicier, but I thought it was fine just as it was. I'll make this again, it's a good, quick meal.

I'm sorry I really didn't find this a good alternative for salmon at all.  Boyfriend and I ate like two bites.  All of the ingredientes were good so I was willing to give it a chance, even though I realized pretty quickly that it even just looked strange...but it was rather terrible.  I think I will just stick with regular spices and so forth for next time.  I just couldn't get into having a breading on top of salmon.  A lot of people seemed to like this recipe though, so maybe it is just not for me!  Thanks anyways.

I gave this four stars because it is not to healthy (with the mayo and all).
But it had a great taste and was very easy. My whole family loved this and there are 8 of us!!! I did add a little hot sauce, as well as yellow mustard ( I didn't have any dried). I would make this again (might try to make it a bit more healthy though) I will let you all know how it turns out.

I thought I would enjoy this recipe because I love salmon, but I thought the flavors of the crust were just too overpowering. I did use crushed herb seasoned stuffing cubes vs. the breadcrumbs, although I don't think that would have a lot to do with it. The majority seems to like it so it could just be my personal tastes. Thanks anyway.

I found this to be a mediocre recipe, so I gave it a 3.  It had an okay-taste, but I didn't find it particularly complimentary to salmon.  There are many other salmon recipes here I would make before considering this one again.

The flavor of this baked salmon reminds me of the one served at a few of the well known casino buffets in Las Vegas; plus it has a yummy crunch to it. A must try if you love fish.

The topping was very tasty, but don't use it on anything thicker than an inch (like the recipe says).  The salmon filet I had was about two inches thick and the topping to fish ratio didn't work very well.  Might try again with a thinner filet.

Had to increase mayo and mustard (I used prepared rather than powder) in order to create a paste.  Tasty, although a bit mayonnaise-y for me.  Broiling it for five minutes resulted in a charred "crust"--I don't know if I just had it too close to the flame, but next time I'll cut the time short too.  I'll have to try to figure out how to cut down on the amount of mayo I have to put in to make it more like a spreadable paste.

Loved it. Mods I made are as follows: Used shallots instead of onion (didn't have one), sauteed fresh garlic instead of dried. Cooked it a tad longer in oven. When I first pulled it out of the oven, I was skeptical, but after a couple of minutes in the broiler, it was wonderful! Will definitely make again. Also served it with lemon wedges on the side. Yum.

Very scrumptious. I did cut the bread crumbs in half and substituted 1/4 cup of gluten free crumbs to make it healthier. That was the only change I made and it came out very good. My husband was apprehensive but loved it so much he finished the dish. I did serve it with lemon wedges and added salt. Next time I make it I will swap out the mustard for Old Bay Seasoning  just to try a variation. The original was just fine though.

Good, but not great. As a family, I am trying to incorporate more salmon into our dining rotation, and this was good. (One of my sons loved it!)  I used sweet onions (all I had), which I think was a bit of a mistake - a little too sweet and the flavor didn't blend well with the other ingredients IMO. I will make it again, but more importantly, I think it's a good recipe to play around with - I was thinking about using plain breadcrumbs and adding lemon pepper seasoning rather than the onions and mustard.

Great recipe! I've made it several times and it's the only way my boyfriend wants salmon now! I added a little Dijon mustard and a splash of lemon juice to the breadcrumb mixture and it came out so moist and delicious!

This was so good. I did use fresh garlic. ( three big cloves, my boyfriend loves garlic). I put in 1/4 of a teaspoon of sage. Splashed some lemon juice on the fish and in the mixture.  It turned out soooo good. My boyfriend loved it :)). This is something I would make again

This was easy and delicious. Followed the recipe exactly and the fish was tender and crunchy.  Served it with a pesto quinoa with cranberries and almonds.

Good flavor, but super overpowering to the salmon. I ended up scraping off half of the topping and just eating the salmon "naked".

The recipe was pretty good, but kind of dry, definatly needs more mayo or other liquid like lemon to make it more pasty, i added some spicy cayenne pepper just cause i like things spicy-- i will try again with a few adjustments and maybe baking a bit longer!

A nice alternative when it come salmon.  I did end up using fresh garlic and real dijon mustard just because that's what I had on hand.

I really liked this, but my husband didn't like the topping.  He said breadcrumbs do not belong on Salmon.  He said it was too much like a honey mustard pretzel.  Oh well, he did say it was at least good enough to keep in my salmon rotation just not his favorite.

my daughter and i gave this a three. the topping tasted exactly like a honey mustard pretzel and was a little overpowering and too thick. the cooking time should be increased by 10 minutes and the broiling did lend a nice crunch.

what an easy dish to make.I did have to cook it longer as the filet I had was thicker.be careful not to over cook it. used chopped green onions(out of yellow onion) but it worked just as well. very moist and tender.good crunchy topping for a added taste.

This was very good. I didn't measure out everything though. My picky 12 year old even liked it! It was like a tangy tarter sauce taste with a crisp on top. It was delicious.

We eat alot of Salmon, but my husband says this is the best he has ever had.  He had salmon the night before in a restaurant and he wants to go back there and give them this recipe because theirs was no where near as good as this recipe.

this salmon left my glands wanting more! The recipe was easy to prepare, and the results were tender, tasty sweet salmon, with a seasoned just right coating that completed the dish. Everybody got seconds, and then asked for the recipe. Almost as good cold the next morning for breakfast as it was fresh for dinner the night before. Thanks.

I made this last night and my family ate every bite.  I thought it was a little too rich, but a little fresh lemon squeezed over the top after cooking probably would have helped that.  It is super easy and I'll definitely make it again.

I'd say this was a 3.5. Took much longer to bake than said and I wasn't thrilled with the results. I don't think I added enough mayo to make a paste. I thought it was a little bland. Probably will tweek- was expecting more I think.

I'm not a big fan of salmon but with this recipe I enjoyed eating it-think
it has something to do with the crust.
Followed it to the letter. If your broiler is extra hot, make sure you check on it at about 3 mins during crisping stage.
Thanks Lon!

I made this dish for dinner tonight and we did not care for it at all.  The flavour of the topping completely overpowered the flavour of the fish and IMHO, the flavour of the topping wasn't that great either.  I'm sorry to say that we won't be making this again.

This was delicious.  Used precooked vidalia onions in a jar instead of sauteeing, and added a bit of paremesan cheese...5 star.

I forsee many variations.

I am picky when it comes to salmon, but i thought this was great!  I really liked the crust and the textures.  So did my boyfriend...until he found out that mayo was in it...then he kind of made a face.  So for people that don't like mayo, don't tell them - they probably won't know!  Also, maybe next time i'll add a tiny bit of hot sauce or cayenne pepper for some spice.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We really enjoyed this.  The only changes I made: I used 1 teaspoon of minced garlic (instead of dried), and I put it on four small salmon filets (1 lb total) and served my whole family.  Served with yellow rice and broccoli.   Yummy!

This dish was very simple to make and my husband LOVES it! I make a double batch so that he can take the left overs for lunch. I get the sweetest voicemails on those days!!!

Yummy!  Taste tested the mayo/crumb topping and geared the seasonings towards my family's taste and it was perfect.

Great recipe.  If you are not a salmon fan, add extra of the topping.  The topping hides the salmon taste.

Sorry, but this didn't do it for me. Followed directions exactly, but it was flavorless.

I really love this recipe. I keep coming back to it and have made it many times. Just a couple adjustments I make are as follows: add lemon juice with the mayo and use thinly sliced onion instead of chopped and fresh garlic. Excellent. Thank you for an easy and tasty salmon recipe.

I thought this a little bit odd of a recipe but decided to try it. My family loved it. In my opinion, it is very rich in flavor, but good paired with a nice wine

This is so yummy!! 
(We had this for the first time about a year ago.) Very simple to make also.  My husband actually made it for us.  It was a huge hit here, even my kids liked it.
I actually came back here to search for the recipie because I had lost it and have been craving it!

Just made this last night. My husband LOVED it. The only thing we noticed is that its a little TOO much flavor, so we decided that next time we won't use as much garlic (we used more than the receipe asked for - ahah) and less mayo.

YUM! I loved this recipe. I left out the oil to saute the onion and used vegetable stock, used fat free mayo in the mixture and used fresh minced garlic. This is one of my favorite salmon recipes. Very easy and very tasty.

I am trying my hardest to like salmon and this recipie didn't do it for me. If you do not like salmon this recipie isn't the one for you. The mayo was a bit overpowering and it took much longer to cook. I will not make this again.

Really good!  I didn't use too much mayo...just enough to hold it together.  I wouldn't really call it a paste.  I will say that you definitely need to watch the broiler closely!

Great recipe, on some of the salmon I added a layer of canadian bacon, thin sliced. That added an interesting flavor to the dish. We enjoyed both the original recipe and with the addition of the bacon.

This was a delicious way to prepare salmon. I intend to put this on my list of company dishes. I might put  a bit more garlic and onion. to give it as much flavor as possible. The other rater's idea of adding more mustard & mayo would be good too. Otherwise it was fabulous just the way it was. The broiling gave it a nice crispy top, not too long though. My whole family enjoyed it. I am always looking for easy, tasty fish recipes and this one's a keeper.
