Delish! Even my husband thought so, and he's one of those people that hates it when different foods touch (meats w/ starches and veggies, etc). I soaked the chicken in garlic oil for 30 minutes and instead of baking it I cooked it up in the bacon fat. Less healthy but juicy and so tasty. Then I drained most of the fat, added more garlic and sauteed the veggies in the same skillet. Yum!
