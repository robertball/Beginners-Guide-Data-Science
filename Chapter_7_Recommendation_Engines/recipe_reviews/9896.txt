I really enjoyed these...I made the mistake of including the purple gumdrops in the first dozen not realizing that they tasted like black licorice...that didn't impress me but after I realized the error of my ways these were a breeze to make and tasted great! Thanks for submitting a recipe that a cookie baking hater such as myself enjoyed making! Updated review: I make these cookies every single year. They are super easy they look good on a goodie platter and people enjoy them.

The cookie part of the recipe was delicious but the gumdrop made it difficult to eat. The only ones who didn't seem to mind were the kids!:)

I thought these were really good! I did have to add about 3/4 cup extra flour so it wasn't so sticky but other than that these were very simple to put together and quite tasty. My little guy loved putting the gumdrops in the middle of each one. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing.:)
