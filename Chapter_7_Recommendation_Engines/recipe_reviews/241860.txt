Has become a favorite request. from my grandkids to my 75 year old father in law. I made these for my grandkids a couple of years ago and now everyone ask when are you making them. Super easy to make and economical. Makes a huge amount. GREAT for gift giving to neighbors or anyone when you need an inexpensive gift for the holidays, and who doesn't love homemade candy?
