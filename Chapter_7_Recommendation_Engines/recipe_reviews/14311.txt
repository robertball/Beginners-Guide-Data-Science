Everyone liked this.  I served it as a main course salad on a mixture of baby spinach and romaine along with rice and sauteed vegetables.  I substituted a TBSP. of the mayo with olive oil and added a bit more mustard and lemon juice.

Sooooo good.  This salad is perfect.. It's filling enough for my boyfriend and healthy enough for me. Very refreshing and easy. I served it on a bed of romaine lettuce and fresh baby spinach instead of iceberg. And I used pecans. But I think any nut would be great in this salad. It is great as a side for grilled salmon.

This salad was great!  I did use some halved red grapes along with a golden delicious apple; I also used slivered almonds instead of the walnuts. I'll definitely make it again with the slight alterations.  It's great for a crowd too.

I really enjoyed this salad...kind of like a Waldorf salad. I went easy on the mayo, used almonds instead of walnuts, and added some dried cranberries. It was very good! I'll be making this again.

I thought this was great, although I did feel compelled to season it a bit more. I substituted brown sugar for honey, forgot to put in nuts, used 'Ultra Low-Fat Miracle Whip', and threw it a few spices. I was GOING to eat the leftovers but it seems that my husband beat me to them!!

Very easy and different. Used green onions instead of regular onion and didn't have walnuts so I subbed dried cherries. I love garbanzo beans and look for ways to use them. Served with fried chicken and deviled eggs.

Very good. I found the dressing to be lightly sweet with a very subtle flavor. The salad made for a really nice light lunch, and I could see adding in a bit of sliced leftover chicken to make it heartier if desired. Next time I would add in some grapes, as suggested, along with the apple for a bit of tanginess. Definitely use a nice tart apple such as granny smith.

Wow -- This was delicious and I will definitely make it again. I increased the serving size to 12 and although it called for 3 apples, I just included 2.  I love the combination of textures.  I added some grill seasoning for added flavor. Next time I may add in some toasted sesame seeds or even cilantro.  Highly recommended -- I received lots of compliments and recipe requests when I served this at my party.

Yummy flavor.  I used both apples and red grapes.  The grapes gave the salad some much-needed color.  I also will toast the walnuts first in the future and put them on top rather than in the salad.

Pretty good, but it turned out a little bit on the bland side.  Next time, I think I'll up the mustard and honey.  Btw, I omitted the walnuts (I don't like them), but next time I might try chopped cashews.  Overall, this recipe is worth keeping.

This was really easy to put together and quite tasty.  I added sunflower seeds and grapes.  It seemed like it needed some kind of seasoning, but I wasn't sure of what to add.  May have to experiment with this one.

One reason I really love this recipe is because you can change it alot and it still tastes great! I added olives, chives, and tomatoes. Tastes great! I'll have to rate this a five star.

Oh my gosh everyone loved this salad! The entire crew ate seconds and asked for the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing. I used two different types of grapes and apples, added cilantro, walnuts, and a little salt and more lemon. Delicious!

Awesome!  We put it on Naan bread, topped it with sliced cherry tomatoes, dill, garlic salt and slices of swiss cheese and baked it for 5 minutes at 400 degrees.  Excellent!!

Used dried beans and added in craisins and cilantro, would skip the cilantro next time.  Definitely see apple, grapes and craisins together. Used Romaine.

Very good! I'm not a big honey-mustard fan so I used vinagrette dressing, also, I didn't use walnuts. This recipe was easy to make and it looked very nice served on iceberg lettuce.

This recipe was 5 star...UNTIL I added the mustard and honey!  That part was not for my personal taste.  Leave out those ingredients and you'll have a winner in my opinion.  However, if you will refrigerate for a couple of days, the flavors meld and it is better even with the honey and mustard.  It is easier to just leave it out.

Wonderful, light but filling meal.  I added a bit more finely diced red onion than it called for, and also kept the nuts out of the mix until serving time.  I added a pinch of cayene pepper when whisking up the dressing--also a grind or two of fresh black pepper. I brought the leftovers for lunch today and mixed them with the shredded lettuce at my desk, tossed on the nuts and also a small handfull of dried cranberries.

PERFECT.  Light yet filling, and absolutely delicious.  Easy on the onions, heavy on the apple, and don't be shy with the honey!  Great as is, or put it on some toasted whole wheat bread and make a sandwich.

Yum! I loved this.  I used apples - no grapes and followed the recipe exactly. Looks like I have another salad to bring for potlucks!

Added a small can of corn and used much less mayo...turned out great!  My wife, who doesn't generally like garbanzo beans enjoyed it as well.

This was a very good salad. I added some cilentro and it tasted really good. I didn't have walnuts but had cashews, and it was also very good. My two teen girls loved it and asked me to do that for their school lunches. I served this as a side dish with salmon. I will definetly make this salad again.

If I could give it 10 stars I would!  This was fantastic.  I made it with walnuts, red grapes, and only about 2 tbsp mayo and added extra dijon mustard to my taste (just my preference, like things a little less sweet).  The textures are outstanding.  I will be making this salad often!

Awesome!!!  I used cashews instead of walnuts as I was serving Chinese and the cashews went better.  I will fix these for myself for lunch.  I might make extra dressing for the added lettuce.  Great Salad thank you.

My family loved this salad!  I love that its so healthy for us.  I went with the version of using olive oil rather then mayo, and included both apples and red grapes.  The vinigrette was delicious.  I did grate in fresh lemon zest and added a touch more dry mustard.  I also added a few tablespoons of gorganzola cheese right before I served it.  Was a perfect picnic salad, cause I didn't need to worry about the mayo base spoiling.  Great recipe!  Thank you.

This was good. Adjust to your family's specific tastes, but I would recommend using the best garbanzo beans you can find. I used Safeway Organic brand (they were on special) and they were too mushy. Salad was not as crunchy as it should have been.

I didn't really like this, but ate it anyway because it was good for me. :)  If you must eat garbanzos, this is a bearable way to do it.

I LOVED this salad. I did change some things but I'm sure it would be great as is...I used a cup of sliced green grapes instead of the apple and celery. I used a half cup dried cranberries instead of the nuts and I added four slices of  crispy veggie bacon (could also use real bacon). The combination of tastes is wonderful!

Excellent recipe! I used organic light mayo and reduced the amount to 1 Tbsp only, then added extra lemon juice. I also had 1/2 red bell pepper that had to be used so I added to this salad too. It turned out sooo good. Thanks for the recipe Dottie!

doubled the mustard, added 1/2 cup grape halves (ok to use, ok to skip), used slivered almonds (YES!), added pepper and steak seasoning.  Used red onion and more than called for.  Green onion would be good.  Good, nice lunch - served in lettuce cup and just on top of lettuce (easier).  Gets better as it sits - kept finding myself grabbing bites of it!

This is a tasty and very quick to make recipe.  I used spicy brown mustard and chopped pecans (don't like walnuts) and it was delicious.  I put it in a bowl lined with green leaf lettuce and it looked pretty.  I will try grapes one of the next times, but the apple added great flavor.  I know someone said to use a tart apple, but I like the flavor of a sweeter apple so I used Gala.  Loved it!  Highly recommend.

I did not have luck with this salad. It may have been that I used dry beans rather than canned. I did soak the beans overnight. It seemed that there was too many beans in comparison to the other ingredients, plus the beans seemed to have an odd taste.

I didn't have nuts. Added craisins, used spicy brown mustard. Very good.
I may try celery seeds in it.

The kids quite liked it. I think next time we'll add grapes and I might let the dressing marinate a bit longer before serving to meld the flavours more.

Love this salad...make it all the time...I substitute pecans for the walnuts and I add shredded rotisserie chicken..then add extra dressing so it is more flavorful...we keep a bottle of the dressing in the fridge so we have an all natural honey mustard for other purposes too!

This is one of my absolute favs now! I leave out the onions & walnuts and add raisans & craisans. I tried both red & green apples - and the green is delicious!

We had this for dinner last night and my husband and I both really loved it.  I put a little more onion, celery, and grapes than called for, and used walnuts.  I loved the dressing and made it with light mayo.  I can see using the dressing for other salads and with more dijon, it could be used with chicken wings.  Thanks for a recipe that can be changed so many ways.

Great!  Prepared as written but served in a bowl instead of on lettuce.  Definitely will make again.
