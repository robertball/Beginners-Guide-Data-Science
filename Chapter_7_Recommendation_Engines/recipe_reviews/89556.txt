It was great, and very simple.  I also added rstd red peppers w/ the chipotles.  I used it as a pasta sauce, but I can't wait to try it on steak.

The chipotle-blue cheese combination is an inspired idea, but I preferred sour cream as a base.  Also, you must be extremely careful with the amount of chipotles you use.    I don't even use the peppers; just about 3 tsp of adobo sauce.  I add chopped fresh cilantro, and it's fantastic!

If you don't like very spicy food, you probably want to stay away from this recipe - the chipotle/adobe sauce is incredibly hot! Even though Husband loves spice, he didn't much like this at all, saying he wouldn't mind a creamy chipotle sauce OR a creamy blue cheese and chive sauce, but together, it just didn't work. It didn't look very appetizing either. Oh well. Thanks anyway.

I thought this sauce was pretty good. Personally, I didn't think it was too hot. We eat spicy foods quiet often... so maybe that is why. I was worried about it being too spicy when I read the reviews before trying the recipe. I went ahead and used the peppers anyway, but I made sure that I did not include the seeds. Next time I will include the seeds to give it more of a kick. The flavor was really good though. 

We used this sauce on homemade burgers with thick, crispy bacon and it was wonderful. Oh yeah- I also made homemade steak fries for the side dish and this sauce was fantastic drizzled over the top of the crispy fries. 

This is a keeper!

Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. I love hot foods but this was over the top and the blue cheese and peppers dont make a good combo.

We drizzled this over steak. We definitely recommend using it with steak.

This didn't turn out well and the flavors didn't keep well. I was disappointed.

After reading the reviews I was very curious how we would like it.   And I have to say we did.  I added Chipotle peppers to taste and used a mild blue cheese.   Also added some flour to thicken it a bit.  Definitely a recipe I will make again, but will tweak it some more to our taste.  Perhaps some cheddar or gouda in addition to the blue cheese to make it a little cheesier.
