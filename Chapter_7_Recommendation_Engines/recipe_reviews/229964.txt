This was my recipe and I made some shortcuts that weren't put in the original recipe. Instead of using the tobasco sauce, garlic powder, and paprika mix, I used a jar of HOOTERS hot wing sauce. I added some olive oil to it to keep it from burning and to coat the potatoes. Then baked them as the recipe states.  Also, not having time to thaw and cube chicken, I used a bag of Fajita chicken pieces, precooked and thawed.  It was perfect and took half the time.

Devoured by both myself and my husband!  I knew he would love it, but I was surprised at how much I did, too.  I followed the author's shortcut except that I used Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on.  Instead of putting raw chicken in with the roasted potatoes, I sprinkled it with the paprika, garlic powder, and seasoning salt, then sauteed the chicken in olive oil until cooked.  I added about a half cup of wing sauce and 3 tbsp unsalted butter to the cooked chicken (this was for a half-recipe) and simmered for about 10 minutes before adding to the roasted potatoes.  Chives are a no-no for my hubby, unfortunately, but this was DELICIOUS anyway!  I should have made the full amount!  I'll be making it again in 2 days when friends come over to watch a football game, and will keep it warm in the slow cooker.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, MammaK!  :)

I'm giving this five stars because the whole concept and final product was amazing and one of our new favorites! But I did do my own version of this recipe (as I usually do!) I roasted the potatoes at the time & temp suggested but with just a drizzle of olive oil and some garlic salt and pepper. Then I had some chicken that I had precooked and shredded, so I tossed that on top then poured the wing sauce over top of everything and mixed together, topped with cheese and put back in the oven until everything was heated thru. For the wing sauce I used some of Franks wing sauce but to tone it down a little I added butter and garlic. Thought I'd share my own twist on this delicious recipe!

This is good with heat-control modifications.  I roasted the potatoes in garlic powder, olive oil, and pepper.  I, like other reviewers, didn't like the idea of putting raw chicken on cooked potatoes, so I cooked the chicken on its own in butter with about 10 drops of hot sauce, garlic powder, and pepper.  When the chicken was done, I took the roasted potatoes out of the oven and mixed in about 1/4 cup of cheese.  I then topped it with the rest of the cheese, the cooked chicken, the bacon, and the green onions and baked it for another 10 minutes.  I served Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Chicken Dipping Sauce on the side.  Everyone loved it, and my heat sensitive seven year old gobbled up the chicken.  I thought the hot sauce gave the chicken a bit of a delicious bit, but he didn't notice.  This is a keeper!

This. Was. Fantastic. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Only change was I sauteed the chicken in the leftover sauce just to brown a bit before putting it over the potatoes...then cooked the rest of the way in the oven. Yes, it's a little time consuming, but SO worth it. My husband absolutely LOVED it. He also said it went perfect with a cold beer. :)

I just tried this recipe. I made a few modifications.  First, made the sauce as directed for the potatoes, then roasted the potatoes at 450 for 40 minutes.  Made additional sauce for the chicken but added a few tbs of butter then added the chicken to soak up the flavors.  Started with a whole roasted chicken and cut it into bite size pieces after removing the skin.  This saved a step and I didn't like the idea of putting raw chicken on the potatoes.  After I took the completed dish out of the oven, added a fried egg to the top.  It added just the thing needed to take away any dryness.  Will definitely make this again.....but for brunch I think.

(UPDATE!!) MADE THIS AGAIN TONIGHT AND ADDED SOME CREAM CHEESE AMAZING!! THATS EXACTLY WHAT IT NEEDED!!! MIXED CREAM CHEESE WITH RANCH LIKE I WOULD IF I WAS MAKING CHICKEN DIP! THEN I CRUSHED SOME TORTILLA CHIPS ON TOP BEFORE BAKING... TO DIE FOR!!! i WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN WITH MY TWEAKS!! Ok hmmmm i thought this was just ok i felt like it was missing something.I did roast my potatoes first used a regular baking dish those were my only changes.I love the concept of this recipe so its worth trying again with some tweaking. For a little extra kick i drizzled some ranch dressing over the top im thinking incorporate either ranch or creamcheese in the potatoes or try using so m e Velveeta i will update my review next time around...lol

This recipe seems VERY labor intensive to me, but I simplified it by cooking the chicken first, then shredding it when it cooled. We topped with sour cream and everyone was happy!

MORE SHORTCUTS:  I used a bag of country style hashbrown potatoes, seasoned and fried them on the stovetop. Cut up and cooked the chicken, added the buffalo sauce, then assembled the casserole. Popped it into the microwave to melt the cheese and heat the bacon bits. Delish and ready in 30 minutes. Served with sour cream on top. My family devoured it.

We love this recipe. I do use a wing sauce but still add the paprika, garlic, salt n pepper. My only problem is the oven REALLY heats my house up. Made this last night for probably the last time until fall. :(  One thing I have learned, when I make the marinade, I remove maybe a quarter to third cup before tossing in the taters.  I still try to leave marinade behind though.  Then when I put the cut up chicken in the bowl, I add the reserve sauce. I bake the bacon to very crispy while prepping the taters.  Then use the bacon grease in place of olive oil.  Once the taters are in the oven (takes about 40 minutes for the taters, stirring every 10 or so), I prep the chicken. Once the chicken goes on top of the taters, I prep the topping (I do bake the chicken for about 5 minutes before topping the dish).  Then, I stick the casserole back for about 10 minutes.  Perfect. I serve with a green salad and lots of my homemade ranch dressing (I make my own seasoning blend then mix with plain yogurt ~ use buttermilk to thin to dressing consistency).

This recipe is incredibly filling and comforting. I didn't have much hot sauce in my fridge so I used a blend of Tapatio, water and tomatoes from the garden and followed the recipe the rest of the way per suggestion. I had some time on my hands, which is a good thing because this recipe takes a minute to cook, but it's worth the wait. I got the whole, "You're such a good wife," love-talk from my husband afterwards. I'd cook this again. ;)

I wanted to love this and it had high ratings, but it just didn't work for me.  We'll eat it this week but the taste was off.  I won't be making this again.

Very tasty.  I don't care for pepper so left the black pepper out and used wing sauce.  The result was not hot at all.  I am thinking of trying it again but using roasted cauliflower instead of the potatoes.

Made the modified recipe with Frank's Hot Sauce, and it was extremely hot!  Next time, I'll try making the sauce as directed.  Didn't have green onions, so I used minced onion & mixed with the chicken & potatoes.  Put a layer of cheese, bacon, chives & topped with cheese (very good!).  Next time, I'll try making the sauce as directed.  Good, but HOT HOT HOT!!!  Thanks mamak!

Liked it as written, the first time I made it. Loved it with a couple of changes. It was too spicy for us the first time, so I halved the hot sauce . For the chicken, I added about 1/2 cup of ranch dressing to the remaining hot sauce mixture , after the potatoes were tossed in it, and let it marinate in that while the potatoes were cooking. Then I cooked the chicken in that ranch-hot sauce marinade with some diced onions before adding it to the potatoes. With the chicken cooked before adding to the potatoes, the potatoes were much crisper....they became a bit soggy with the chicken having to cook on top of them. Just a personal preference, but my family loves it this way.

Wow! Yummy! I only put half the pepper sauce in because I didn't want to kill everyone and I wanted my kids to like it. It was PLENTY hot this way.  
I cooked the chicken first also.
It's a keeper.

This was our 2013 Superbowl Dinner with guacamole and non-fat sour cream on the side.  I omitted the salt, used Kraft non-fat shredded cheddar cheese and turkey bacon.  I also used a whole bottle of Frank's chicken wing sauce for the hot sauce. I put my air-bake cookie sheet under the 9x13 dish because the hot sauce tends to burn easy. It looked just like the picture. Thank you mammak!

Just made this for a potluck today and was told I didn't bring enough! I used the bacon grease for the oil and Frank's Red Hot Sauce. Put the raw bite size chicken on top of potatoes and covered with cheese and bacon and it came out perfect!  Will definitely make this again.

My daughter said I just had to try this recipe. When I try a recipe I always make it exactly as written the first time...myself, my daughter and son-in-law...loved this recipe. It was a tad spicy for me but they both loved it and my son-in-law said "the next time make it spicier". Well, I am making it again tonight for dinner, and I will not change a thing. Thank you so much for the recipe, mammak!

Firefighter seal of approval! My crew loved it. If you’re feeding about 3-4 people I recommend 4-5 potatoes. 8 was way too many. I also recommend doubling the wing sauce and browning the chicken before you add it to the plate.

It turned out pretty good. We used siracha instead of hot sauce because we didn't have any. We halved the siracha.

SPICEY!!!!!  WOW!! My mouth is still on fire!!!  My husbands face turned bright red and we both like spicey but not this one!!  Have a cold drink in hand to put out the fire!   I made only 1/2 recipe but made the whole recipe of the marinade.  I was sure the ingredients were the wrong amounts.  6T hot pepper sauce?  1 T pepper??  I halved the hot pepper sauce to 3T but put in the 1 T pepper minus a little.  If I ever make this again I will only put in 1 teaspoon pepper.  I believe it was the pepper that was so hot. I also added cut up chicken cubes to the pan and cooked it several minutes.  I didn't like adding the raw chicken.  It is a lot of work to make this.  I wondered about using a bag of thawed cubed hash browns, Franks Red Hot Hot sauce, to speed things up.  I believe this could be tweaked and it would be yummy.  I may try it another day.

Tried it. Thought it would be great. Didn't enjoy it. Way too spicy. Just not our taste.

sooooooo delicious! I am a beginner cook and I was able to successfully make this dish and it was so yummy. I told my husband I would be making it again and he said "YES YOU WILL BE!"

It was great. Anyone who is looking at the recipe and going, man that seems like a long time and a high heat for potatoes...actually, it's about right. I put them in at 450 rather than 500 and it was still 45 minutes. The potatoes do tend to soak up most of the sauce, so I did make a little extra to put on the meat. My husband actually took leftovers to work the next day, which is the highest praise he can give a food.

I made this last night for my husband for our anniversary dinner and we both just loved it! I will most definitely be making this again! Being from western NY I do love me some Frank's Hot Sauce. The potatoes were a but more spicy since they seemed to soak up the sauce more than the chicken did but a little ranch dressing on the side took care of that. Fantastic recipe-I'm so glad I found it!

Everyone loved it!  I thought it my be too spicy for my 8 & 10 year old.  They topped it with plenty of sour cream, and it wasn't a problem.  Definitely adding it to our family favorites.

Made this tonight with pre-cooked chicken and also added some chopped asparagus to the chicken. It had heat and the family loved it. Will do this again for sure. P.S. I used sir racha sauce.

Took this dish to a group potluck and it was  scraped clean and not enough for seconds. I made this exactly as recipe  said  but did brown the chicken  for a few minutes before topping potatoes. (Raw chicken on top of cooked potatoes is something I can't do, although it probably  would be fine.) The changes I would make is a tad less hot sauce and after heating the sauce and  spices, I would  pour and toss 2/3 of mixture with potatoes and 1/3 with the chicken separately and not in pan  as there isn't enough sauce left in pan for  chicken after tossing potatoes...or  increase  the  sauce by 1/2 and follow the recipe directions. Don't skip the bacon or green onion  and serve with ranch or bleu cheese dressing.

This is a crowd pleaser!  I double the amount of potatoes and chicken used and make 2 pans, 1 using the buffalo chicken sauce, and 1 using barbeque sauce for those that don't like spicy foods!

This is a total gem of a recipe. I have made it many times as it’s my sons favorite meal.  I don’t peel the potatoes-just wash them and cut them into cubes. I use Costco rotisserie chicken breast pulled apart to make that part quicker. Costco has a super easy and awesome microwaveable bacon I use that makes it even quicker. Everyone who tastes it loves it. Will be making it again tonight!

It was yummy. I loved it, my mom liked it but it was too spicy for her. Although I had to make more sauce mixture bc the potatoes took it all up but it's delicious. Oh I put ranch on top of it and it cooled it down a lot but I love spicy anyway. Next time I'll use Frank's red hot sauce instead of Texas Pete.

This was a terrific hit with myself, husband and teenage son. I only made two small changes to the recipe. I used 2 Tablespoons of Frank's hot sauce vs the 6 and replaced the lost liquid volume with 4 more Tablespoons of olive oil. (I can only handle so much heat/spice).  The second change is that I didn't preheat the sauce prior to pouring it over the potatoes.

Like many others, I modified the methodology.  I cut up potatoes and used about half a bottle of wing sauce to coat them.  Into a hot oven to begin baking.  I fried 4 pieces of bacon and then browned the chicken.  I put the chicken on a separate baking pan in the oven.  When they were both done, I used the remaining sauce on the chicken and added it to the potatoes.  Then topped with cheese and bacon.  Back in the oven for 5 minutes to melt the cheese then added the green onions.  It was a MAJOR hit with my husband and son.  A little hot for me, but tasted great.

Okay this is way too delicious to confine to potlucks and special occasions! I wouldn't have changed anything I I had the right ingredients on hand. That being  said, I used franks hot sauce, I had no bacon :/ and I only had sharp cheddar. This was still amazing! I had a craving so I crunched up nacho Doritos mixed in.... Oh my sweet America Fabulous!!

The only thing I did differently was sauté the chicken and leave it warm on stove top while potatoes cooked- then I topped potatoes with chicken and cheese and bacon as the recipe said - it was amazing!! I'm going to tell my son in college as a short cut to use frozen potatoes or tots and already cooked buffalo chicken

My family and myself loved this recipe. However I did the same using franks wing sauce to marinade only the chicken. The potatoes I took and tossed with olive oil and two ranch packets,and roasted and followed the remaining steps as usual.

I made this, as written, the other night and both my husband and I loved it.  Oh, I didn't add the salt but that's a personal preference.  I felt the hot sauce, cheese and bacon would have ample sodium for our taste and it did.  If I served it to guests I would probably suggest to them what I always suggest regarding food I cook, "you may want/need more salt".

Loved it!!! Used low fat cheese and turkey bacon. Will use regular cheeses next time though because low fat doesn't melt as nice and goes abut dry. Also made some homemade blue cheese dressing to accompany. Yummy! Sliced potatoes thin in rounds and microwaved for a few minutes to save bake time before I coated with hot sauce mixture. They baked with a crisp which I loved. Family really enjoyed it too! Will make again for sure

Fantastic recipe! My teenage son and husband devoured it. I doubled the recipe for this reason! I'm not a fan of much spice, so I topped my own helping with sour cream on top and this cut the spicy flavor a lot. Even though I don't like a ton of heat, I must say the flavors of all the ingredients,just as listed, was really quite delicious!

My family LOVES this recipe and it's become expected on Friday nights. It's great the way it is, but over the past year I've made some changes to it.  I'm trying to lose weight, so now I use only 1T olive oil and 1/3 cup chicken broth. It makes very little difference in taste, but reduces the calories significantly, especially since we only get 7 servings from this and not 10. I leave out the salt. I partially cook the chicken in the pan with the leftover spice mixture.  And finally, one day I didn't feel like cutting up the potatoes, so I used a French fry cutter instead. The kids loved it and now they always volunteer to cut the potatoes into fries for me, so that's what we do now.  This recipe is a definitely winner in our house.

Yummy!  I wasn't sure what size or kind of potatoes, so I used 900 grams of red potatoes, with the skin.  I used Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce.  We're trying to cut calories around here, so I used half of the olive oil, substituted some of the cheese with reduced fat cheese, and reduced the bacon to 4 slices. Awesome recipe.

Cooked this for the super bowl and everyone loved it. The pepper does kick the spice up but we all love spicy so this was perfect for us. I also boiled and pulled the chicken than left it in the sauce while the potatoes cooked and added a little butter to the sauce recipe.

Twice in a week I found recipes on here that got a full four thumbs from my family.  Truly something to celebrate!  The only actual change I made was in the amount of the hot pepper sauce.  I just splashed in enough so that it seemed right, but we tend to like thing spicier.  I wound up doubling the "marinade" recipe since there was nothing left to saute the chicken chunks in after doing the potatoes.  I then cooked the chicken so that it was at least cooked on all sides with no pink showing before transferring it to the oven for the final bake.  Even with the extra hot sauce I used it bakes up very mild, so have plenty of extra on hand if you like a true buffalo kick.

This recipe was okay ... I halved it as it was only two of us eating and thought we'd have the leftovers the next day.  We found it very dry ... needs something else but I'm not sure what?  Don't think I'll be making this again!

Instead of green onions, I used yellow onion.  Added the onion with the potatoes.  Also added a cup of chopped celery with the chicken.  Gives a little crunch and is very nice.

I have made this recipe twice and both times the family loved it.
I love how easy this is to make. I love red potatoes and used them instead of Yukon gold. I.added a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes because we love spice.
I served it with collard greens. Great recipe.

I was in the mood for Buffalo chicken, but I needed more to make it a meal, so I was just going to roast some potatoes. Then I found this recipe! Just what I needed rolled into one. 
My amounts were less, since it was just for two, but used more hot sauce (Frank's & Tabasco Buffalo; we like it hot)and omitted the cheese & bacon. Served with cut carrots & celery & blue cheese on the side. I'm thinking maybe I'll incorporate the carrots & celery into this casserole in the winter, with maybe some crumbled blue cheese on top. Great recipe, I will make this again!

Made this recipe almost exactly as written.  Added some green peppers but that's it.  It was super yummy and we all couldn't quit eating it.  But it was so hot that it made our tender tummy's sick.  The left overs are even better.  We topped it with ranch dressing but it still didn't take enough heat away.  I probably will still make it again though it was that good!

Great recipe! Hubby and I loved it and since we were cooking for two I made a half batch, which was perfect!  The only thing i did different was to cook the chicken first in the remaining sauce then added it to the baked potatoes.  It saves a little bit of baking time!

Made it almost exactly as posted, but I added about 2T of ranch dressing to the sauce mixture to cool it down a little. I like dishes with potatoes since they're cheap and I'm a student (but really, everyone likes cheap stuff, right?) but they can get a little bland. I didn't have bacon or chives, but this was still very much not bland.

It tasted great with Frank's RedHot and cooking the chicken before putting it on the roasted potatoes.  I just pan fried the chicken marinated in RedHot with a little olive oil and added it on top of the potatoes with the cheese, bacon, and green onions.  Delicious!  Will make this again.

Totally cheated on this one.  I never make anything exactly as written, but this one was too labor intensive so I sped it up a bit.  Followed the instructions for the sauce somewhat (got a 6 yr old that's not fond of really spicy food, yet) so I made it a bit milder than called for, and the bacon, but that was about all of the recipe I followed.  I used Alexis Home fries, from the freezer section and Tyson's breaded chicken tenders.  My version is pretty high up there on the calorie count, but hey, we can splurge every once in while.  I liked the idea of the recipe very much, but I needed to cut out some of the time involved (20 min prep time?  Who you kidding?)so I went all "Sandra Lee" on it.

I made this tonight for dinner.  My family and I just LOVE it!!!!  So delicious!  I doubled the sauce, as we like hot and spicy food, and we added a bit of sour cream on the top after we dished up the plates.  Fantastic!  Would definitely make this again and again!

I simplified this as well. I did take the suggestion of using pre-made buffalo sauce (Hooters).  Dumped halft of the sauce over the cubed potatoes prior to baking them.  I also baked a few chicken breasts during the same time the potatoes were sitting in the oven.  Cut them into cubes after cooked and used rest of buffalo sauce on them before mixing them together with potatoes.  Then all I had to do was top with cheese and bake it to melt.

I halved the recipe, used the Hooters wing sauce and it was delicious!  Hubby loved it but, amazingly, so did I!  I also did not add the bacon and the chopped scallions until after I took it out of the oven.  That way the scallions stayed fresh and the bacon didn't get over-crisp.  We topped with a little bit of sour cream.  Great flavor combination!

I doubled the sauce, dividing it as I coated 9 medium potatoes, then used the second half to coat 3.96 lbs of chicken because that is what I had on hand. I am glad I did! This was ssoo good, even my extremely hard to please fiancee approved. I did serve sour cream on the side that we ended up mixing into our individual servings.  Thank you for a delicious new recipe!

Loved this and it will be a new staple in our house! Added a bit more sauce than the recipe called for, also used Buffalo Wing sauce which has butter in it. This crisped up the potatoes nicely.

I’ve made this a few times now and everyone always loves it.  This last time I substituted most of the sauce ingredients for Frank’s Buffalo Wing Sauce. I tossed the potatoes and chicken in olive oil and the buffalo sauce. I didn’t bother heating the sauce.  This was a lot faster, easier, and I think it tasted better.

I thought this was good, but my guys all thought that there was too much potato and not enough chicken. Second time I made it, I used about half the potatoes and more chicken and all was well. Great with some ranch  or bleu cheese!

Wicked spicy hot! I halved the recipe and cooked it in the instant pot for 20 minutes (would do 15 min next time) and then turfed it to the oven at 400 to melt cheese on top. I added half brick cream cheese like another reviewer . Gave 4/5 stars instead of 5 just because it’s so hot.

This was a family fan favorite! I made a couple of changes though. Instead of cubed potatoes, I used PEI mini potatoes. I also used Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

I did not make any changes to the recipe.  It seemed like everything tasted the same.  It was good, but not awesome.  It was labor intensive and created a pile of dishes.  Also, cooking the chicken in the sauce while the potatoes were in the oven was imperative because it would never have cooked in 15 min at 400.

Very tasty.  I cut in half but kept the olive oil and sauce the  same.  I also partially precooked the chicken on my grill before cutting it into cubes.  My family said this is a keeper.

Love this recipe, I made it exactly as is the first few times and then we went low carb so I switched the potatoes out with cauliflower. Still one of my favorites. Very yummy!!

I used an entire can of the ElPato tomatoes sauce with this every time.  And gives it a kick.  1/2 can w/ the spuds, & 1/2 can w/ the chicken.

I liked the way the potatoes were made. I made this like the recipe called for except I used six potatoes. And I STILL had to use two pans. This was too spicy. I plan on making this again but instead of the sauce it called for, I'm going to make my own BBQ sauce.

I added some sweet baby peppers and since I have a finicky eater in the house I halved the hot sauce, but it was still amazing.

with 5 kids i am always looking for a throw in the oven kind of recipe. i read reviews to add a cream cheese ranch mixture, which added alot of flavor. i cooked the potatoes in the oven for about 30 minutes and put Chunk chicken breast ontop to cook. i then mixed buffalo sauce on it, followed by the cream cheese mix, and reg cheese topped with bacon. potatoes were tender and good was creamy and delish. the kids loved it!!

One of my favorites. I have followed this recipe to the letter and it is delicious. I've also made it a few times substituting bacon fat (why waste it, it has an almost identical makeup as olive oil, same smoking point and it's way more flavorful) in place of olive oil. Worked out just fine. You could also parboil your potatoes to cut back on roasting time, but don't forget to add a tablespoon or two of vinegar and salt to the pot. I think red potatoes are best for this recipe.

I will make this again, however, 500 degree oven was way too hot. 350 would make more sense. I will be trying it at least one more time. The flavors were just spot on but with the burnt potatoes not so good.

Tasty!  Have to admit I used Frank's Red Hot sauce instead of making the sauce from scratch, also used some rotisserie chicken so it cut way down on the prep time.  I used red potatoes and baked them in my oven at 425 for 50 min.  Went by the recipe for everything else and it's delish!  I'll be sure to use it for a football Saturday coming up, thanks for sharing it.

Halved recipe:  used red potatoes (around 6 or 8,, enough to cover the bottom of the 8x8 pan), used red hot, served with a little ranch on top- doug especially loved this.  Did brown the chicken  before adding on top

I would give this ten stars if I could. My husband hates just about everything if it's not from a restaurant, and he managed to pick his way through this one. I have to put the green onion on after its cooked and plated so he doesn't freak that there might be some in his portion. I did use Hooters wing sauce as suggested. Total win!

My family really enjoyed this, and they definitely said that they would like to have it again. Easy to make, it does take a little bit of time if you are not already using packaged hash browns. Which I think I may try the next time.

Have made this recipe multiple times. Tastes good with either Frank's or Sriracha. Only difference I cook the chicken before putting it on top of the potatoes.

I love this recipe. I make a few alterations, like most people. First of all, in my opinion, there is not enough sauce for both the potatoes and chicken. I make about 3/4 one recipe of the sauce for the chicken, and I cut the chicken ahead of time and let it marinate for a couple hours (or overnight) in the fridge. Then when it gets time to start dinner, I make another sauce recipe for the potatoes. Lastly, I was very nervous at first about putting the raw chicken on the potatoes. The first time I made this recipe I actually cooked the chicken in a pan first. I do not recommend doing that. The flavor and texture of the chicken is much better when you follow the recipe. You have to remember the oven is VERY hot at this point. The chicken begins to cook as soon as you add it to the dish. The only change I made is that I add the chicken and cook for 15 without the topping. Then I check a piece of chicken to make sure it is cooked. If the chicken is done, I add the topping and cook for an additional 5 or so minutes till the cheese is melted.

My family loves this dish.  I don't heat the sauce in a sauce pan.  Just mix it in a bowl.  I also substitute some of the buffalo sauce with bbq sauce just because my family loves bbq and buffalo mixed.  Always a hit!

Loved it!  Made pretty much as listed except I cooked the chicken while the potatoes were roasting. It  sped up the cooking process at the end.  I cooked the chicken in butter with Franks and chopped garlic and it was a perfect compliment to the potatoes.  My husband ate it until he had a tummy ache!  Great recipe full of flavor!

It was delicious. I ran out of the sauce because it was too thick so I added water and more olive oil. I used yellow potatoes and they were perfect.

Very good recipe. Cut back on hot sauce to 3 TBS because hubby doesn't care for spicy food. Could barely taste hot sauce.

My husband loved it. He thought it might work better with bleu cheese crumbles or dressing for a dip or side sauce. I used about a tablespoon of minced garlic and garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt. I used one of my favourite hot sauces, Frank's original hot sauce. It was good not too spicy but had a kick. I also used red potatoes and diced yellow onion and roasted both together and I left out the bacon. I liked this recipe a lot bc of the simplicity. I will make it again but I'm going to add mushrooms and bleu cheese crumbles and dressing side. Great recipe though!

Husband loved it!!!  I put a fried egg on top and added cream cheese as suggested.  I also precooked the chicken.  Really good.  Next time I may add some homegrown tomatoes but that might be gilding the Lilly.

Followed the recipe except I had chicken thighs instead of breasts and I didn't measure the bacon (used one whole package) or green onions (used one whole bushell). It was delicious! We will absolutely make it again, but next time I will cook the chicken in the skillet while the potatoes are roasting. It will cut down on some of the time in the oven and make me feel more at ease about putting the chicken on top of the potatoes.

My husband and I love this recipe. I have made it a couple different time. Is a little spicy for our taste. I use 4 tablespoons instead of 6. I top it with sour cream and my husband like ranch dressing. Either way it is an amazing recipe.

I have to say I'm a bit disappointed and will have plenty of leftovers that will be thrown away unfortunately.   I made the recipe as written and was too hot for my family.  It was also very labor intensive.  My boys were sniffling at the dinner table over how hot it was and they normally love buffalo chicken (especially Buffalo Wild Wings)  May try again with some modifications in the future.

This was really good! A little too spicy for me. Next time I'm going to try using a bourbon buffalo sauce I found on the site. Had some trouble getting the sauce right with this recipe, wasn't sure if it was still supposed to be gritty or if all that would eventually cook out of it. Topped it with sour cream, but next time I would use ranch or blue cheese dressing. Definitely needs some adjustment to fit my tastes.

It was everything I was hoping it would be.  I had buffalo wing sauce so I probably shouldn't have added the extra oil, but it was still really good.  I might just make the potatoes in the wing sauce without the other ingredients as a side dish for something else.

This was interesting - I cut the hot sauce by half and it was still plenty spicy. Next time (it's a keeper) will cut a bit more to satisfy the family. Also, I just tossed some of the sauce over my bowl of potatoes, then sauteed chicken thighs in the rest of the sauce before adding to the cooked potatoes. Loved the yummy combo of cheese, bacon, green onions - that alone is a fun base for other meats. Thanks!

Followed directions. It turned out great.  Used Franks, served with more Franks and blue cheese dressing.  I don't think I will add bacon the next time.  It doesn't add much .

We loved this and it will be in my regular meal rotation. I made it as written for the most part, with just some little changes. I used pre-cooked frozen chicken strips from Trader Joes. After I added the chicken to the skillet to marinate I added another tablespoon each of olive oil and Frank's hot sauce, as there wasn't much of the sauce left. I added a light layer of bleu cheese on top before baking as buffalo chicken is not complete w/o that contrasting sharpness of flavor. Delicious!

Second  time  making this . .. seasoned potatoes and chicken   in a mixture of Sazon and ranch  dressing mix. Fried the potatoes  before putting  them in the sauce because  they weren't  cooked enough  last time. I skipped  the onions and used pizza blend shredded cheese. The dish had a kick to it  but nothing overwhelming  or intolerable like last time.

Wow! This recipe is so good! The only thing that I changed was used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt. I was out out of garlic powder. I also boiled the chicken before hand. That's just me and my poultry fear! I threw it on some tortillas and wow! Very good! Will be making this regularly!

SOOOO DELISH!!!!  I left off the green onions and served with Marzetti's Ultimate Blue Cheese Dressing, and it was difficult to have just one serving!  I also served it with baby carrots and celery sticks for a complete meal.

This came out great! I had to substitute paprika for chili powder and olive oil for veggie oil (thought I had them but I apparently was wrong ??) It's got a decent kick to it, most likely from the chili powder, but the hubby and I don't mind a little spice! Will definitely make this again, maybe with ALL the right ingredients ??

I LOVE this recipe. I Alter it a little depending on what's in the pantry. I usually use veg. Oil bc it's all i have. And I use 4 TBS of hot sauce bc my husband doesn't like it so hot. And substitute the remaining two with water. I make this once a week. I absolutely love it.

This was deeeelish! I took the short cut of using Frank's Red Hot Sauce. I bought a rotisserie chicken, removed the skin, picked the meat off and marinated in hot sauce as well. After roasting the potatoes I mixed in a can of cream of chicken and also mixed in the marinated chicken to give it a more "casserole" feel. Next time I may try drizzling a very light layer of ranch before adding the cheese for an extra dimension... but overall fantastic!

Instead of following the directions above..I fried the potatoes in grease, I chopped the bacon up into little pieces with onions and fried it together...while all this was happening I soaked the chicken + the spices in the hot sauce in a bowl cut up....then i cooked the chicken in the bacon and onion grease...I used sharp cheddar ontop and put it in the oven for 10 minutes then turned the broiler on for a few just to make the top a little brown  it turned out really really good oh and i used yellow sweet onion instead... i would consider putting sour cream and chives ontop

I make this all the time. Sometimes I par boil the potatoes to cut back on the baking time. Chopped peppers are great to mix in with the pieces of chicken as well.

I bought pre-cooked bacon to save another step. I had some Frank's wing sauce leftover from another recipes so I used that instead of making the Tabasco mixture in the recipe. I used a 1/2 cup ( that was ok, but next time I will use a full cup) along with olive oil. This was very good and I especially love the roasted potatoes.

This recipe was so easy to make and so delicious to eat. My fiancé loved it and plan to make it again many more times in the future. I don't like anything too spicy, so I just used a few sprinkles of chilli powder instead of the hot pepper sauce. It was just enough to keep my fiancé happy and keep my tongue in tact.

I randomly found this recipe after I had just picked up a huge batch of red skin potatoes at the farmers market. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect the chicken was cooked perfect with the times and temperatures given. I love buffalo chicken and it wasn't too spicy for my roommate. Everyone was so impressed with my casserole-making abilities. I will definitely make this again.

We liked this a lot. We used a homemade BBQ sauce that we also found on Allrecipes. We cooked the chicken in some of the sauce first and shredded it a little. We definitely needed more sauce than the recipe called for. When the dish was done cooking, we fried an egg and put it on top. It was delicious. Will make again.

Made this recipe last night.  However, since I am not a fan of Buffalo Sauce, I omitted the hot sauce and replaced it with Ranch Dressing.  It was a hit and only a small amount was leftover.  I used red potatoes with the skin on, and it only took about 30 minutes for them to cook in the oven, I pre-cooked the chicken before adding it to the potatoes.  Total cook time for this was about 45 minutes.  Will try making this again, and may add a little barbecue sauce, or a smaller amount of the hot sauce with the ranch.  I also think it would be good with some chopped onion added to the potatoes.

I did change a couple of things here. 
I have some wimpy family members here so I used half as much "Hot Sauce, and the same amount of "Apple Vinegar" to keep that Buffalo taste.
I also pan fried the Bacon, almost an entire pound ( I like Bacon). After the Potato mixture was cooked, (almost an hour) I placed the chicken over the Potato's for 20 minutes at 400 degrees until done. 
Then half of the cheese mixture, then an entire 16 ounce container of Sour Cream, and the remaining cheese. Then back into the oven for 10-12 minutes with the heat OFF just to melt the cheese.

I love this. I roast the potatoes for 20 min at 500, add wing sauce at the half way mark. I use the precooked chicken and bacon. Mix more sauce over chicken and bacon. Then add the potatoes. Mix it all together and put it in a casserole dish and bake for 20 more minutes at 375. Add cheese bake for 10 more min.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend wasting bacon or chicken on this recipe. the best part was the potatoes-- the rest really didn't contribute anything. When I made the sauce, I found that it was thick (more of a paste than a sauce) because 1/3 cup of oil and 6 tbs of hot sauce is not enough liquid to absorb the vast amounts of powdered spices. the potatoes themselves were quite good, but as a casserole I will not make this again.

This recipe was very easy to make the only change I would make is less salt, most definitely making it again...

Made it with the suggested changes of cooking the chicken AND onion first and used less cheese as I didn't want it turning into a melted cheese mess. It was AWESOME....

Tried this tonight, it was pretty good. I think next time I will leave out the chicken. I baked the chicken separately then let marinade in the sauce. I just didn't think the chicken added anything to the recipe as far as flavor.  I tripled the sauce and added a little brown sugar because the first 1/2 of the potatoes used up all of the sauce. This would make a great side, again minus the chicken. And I mixed the cheese into the potatoes instead of just on top.

I made a few adjustments but the only one that did not like it was my husband. He has different taste than the kids and I.But I used french fries instead if potatoes and chipotle tabassco sauce instead if plain hot sauce.  It was so good. not to hot at all

Made this last night for my family and wanted it to be a hit!  I used Frank's red hot and for us, it wasn't very spicy.  We thought it was dry, like it was missing something.  I also thought it would be more like a casserole.  It was more like breakfast potatoes with chicken.  Not going in my recipe box.

I will definitely be making this again!  I used Frank's Red Hot sauce and only had chicken legs/thighs on hand.  I boiled the chicken and shredded it.  I needed some chicken broth to freeze anyway and knew with only having the legs/thighs it would be easier to do this way.  Sooo Good!!

This was good.  Nice combination of flavors.  Not healthy at all, but I guess I can splurge every once in a while.  Made two batches and froze one for later.  I think it is a little more work with having to cook the potatoes ahead, but since it freezes and reheats so well, I just make sure I make double every time I make it so I feel like the time it takes is justified.  :)

This was such a surprise!  So delightfully satisfying.  the addition of crumbled bacon on top really added.  I served this with the option of ladling ranch dressing on top.  Grandkids were wow'd!

I love buffalo sauce but do not eat wings, so I was looking for something like this for a while, I'm so happy I tried it. I did pretty much the same, but I did bake the chicken and potatoes separate, once it was baked I put all of it together and sprinkled with cheese (just a little less than recipe called for) the bacon and chives and put it back in the oven to melt the cheese. chicken stayed moist, it made a lot of liquid from its own juices. Thank you for this recipe.

I used Frank's Hot Sauce and Turkey bacon to make it a bit healthier. My husband is not a cheese fan (sympathy accepted!) so it was a bit dry. No doubt cheese and sour cream would have made this 100% better, but it was definitely a winner as it was!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this!  I halved the recipe since I was only cooking for two.  I was concerned about all the potatoes getting done but I followed the directions and stirred them every 10 minutes and since I halved the recipe it only took them like 30 minutes to get done. I didn't add the bacon til after it was done because I didn't want it to get too crispy.  The only thing I will do differently next time is add more hot sauce it wasn't quite spicy enough but the flavor was amazing.  Thanks for the recipe!
