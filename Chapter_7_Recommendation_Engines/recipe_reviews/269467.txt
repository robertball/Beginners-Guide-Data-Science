The candied cranberries were alright but everything else was great. Family enjoyed it too. Didn't realize with the glaze that you should make it fast while it's still hot. Had to make it twice because it clumped up too much.

This is the most delicious topping for a cheesecake I have ever tasted even cheesecake haters in my house loved it.  The only thing I did different is bake the cake in a water bath and left it in the oven for a few hours.  No cracks!  Yes I will make this again, but I don't know how frozen cranberries will work as opposed to fresh.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Wonderful! Recipe sounds complicated but you do most of it the day before. I couldn't find digestive biscuits to make the crust so I used prepared graham cracker crust (larger 10" size). Worked perfectly fine.  The sugared cranberries were probably the most unexpectedly good part - looked perfectly festive and tasted yum too.

I had to make it with raspberries because the store was out of cranberries but it was still fantastic.

Loved it.  Made it as is, and the whole family enjoyed it.

No changes...well actually...no store around carried Mc Vities digestive biscuits , so I used BelVita breakfast biscuits. Not happy about the situation but it certainly didnâ€™t take away from accolades at Christmas dinner. Very pleased and have a friend clamoring for it when I visit Florida this winter.
