I've had this recipe since I was a kid. They're very good and easy to make. You definitely need to add 2 tablespoons of milk or water to the dough; otherwise, it will be too dry and crumbly. NOTE: The recipe calls for only 14 kisses, but you need about 48 because that's about how many cookies the recipe makes.

Absolute mess. I followed the recipe exact, and I also used name brand peanut butter. I made NO changes. The dough was extemely dry and had to be warmed in my hand for a minute before it would form into a ball, and then it just would not spread into a cookie. I don't have money to waste on ingredients and that's exactly what happened. I should have stuck with the well known Jif blossom recipe. I have no idea what happened. Honestly. Not when I followed the recipe exact. EDITED: Wish I would have read through the reviews and known that I was supposed to add two tablespoons of milk to the cookie recipe. I was able to salvage part of the dough, thank goodness, but that's after I added milk to the dough.

I've made these cookies before and they're great!  I added extra peanut butter for more flavor.  A sure fire hit for get togethers!

These are delicious and buttery.  They turn out well every time.  I used to make these once a month for theater meetings in college.  I find that the recipe makes more than 14 (smallish) cookies - I get about 3 dozen.  I use Brach's chocolate stars instead of kisses (I think they taste better with peanut butter).  Also, I bake them at 375 for 8-10 minutes and return them to the oven for only 2-3 minutes.

Love them! Only change is to add 2T of milk and use butter instead of shortening (or at least half butter half shortening). You can add more or less flour as needed. It's a flexible recipe. Just put in whatever's needed to allow you to roll into a ball.

This recipe works really well if you cut the flour to 1 1/3 cups.  It makes about 32 cookies, so you will need more kisses.

I didn't read all of the reviews, just Sarajo's and noted she had a crumbly dough.  So, I left out a 1/4 cup of the flour and found that worked for me.  The dough was a tad dry, but workable and I didn't have to add anything to get it to form into balls.  Other than this adjustment that was needed, I didn't have to do anything else with these cookies.  They taste good and are pretty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very dry dough..added more peanut butter and 2 TBL. Milk..took a lot longer to cook..last batch turned heat up to 375Â°  and cooked for 10 minutes....they do still taste good..is good basic recipe but one you have to tweak a little bit....also I kept my chocolate kisses in the freezer so when I put them on cookies had no problems with them..good thing cause it took longer to cook then specified

I absolutely love this recipe.  The reason I vote this the best is the putting the cookies back in the oven after inserting the kisses.  It makes them all gooey and warm...perfect for the cookies!

I would suggest using 3/4 cup peanut butter, 1/3 cup of light sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2 TB milk to make the batter.  These will come out great, but need to cool on a wire rack for a while until the chocolate kiss dries after baking.

My son and I made these cookies and doubled the recipe for which we got over 100 cookies. They were the most delicious of all the peanut blossom recipes I have tried and will definitely make them again. Instead of the kisses, we used Reese's bell shaped chocolate with peanut butter inside.

This is a really great recipe...delicious...but I believe the count is wrong.  I doubled the recipe because we like them bigger than a teaspoon and 14 teaspoon size wouldnât be enough.  Doubling I got 48 large cookies using a small ice cream scoop (over a tablespoon).  I also used butter instead of shortening.  I have seen other recipes for these, using the 3 ingredient peanut butter cookie recipe (1 cup pb; 1 cup sugar; 1 egg).  That is actually my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe and great if you are gluten free but not for storing a bit.  Those are best eaten the same day. Today, I am Christmas baking in advance so this recipe is the best!

This is a very good recipe if you add 2 tablespoons milk and make a few other changes... bake at 375 degrees F., use margerine in place of shortening, make into 1 inch balls, use 46 kisses, and DO NOT put them back in the oven after the candy is added.  When I make this recipe it yields about 4 dozen cookies.

I was so mad when I made this recipe because the dough was so dry that I couldn't even shape the dough into balls with my own hands! Definitely an oversight of some sort that there is no liquid in the recipe -- the 2 tablespoons of milk mentioned previously will do wonders. Also, the recipe only calls for 14 kisses but the dough makes 2 dozen at least, depending on how big you make your cookies, so you'll need a whole bag.

I followed the directions to the letter, but at the point when you're supposed to roll the dough into balls, it was clear that the dough was *really* dry.  It seemed like it was missing a liquid ingredient.  I checked another recipe for Peanut Blossoms on this site, and it was almost identical, except the other recipe included two tablespoons of milk.  After I added the milk, the consistency was fine, and the cookies were delicious (although next time I'll use more peanut butter).  If you do use this recipe *make sure* to add milk!
