This cake provided a decadent outstandingly delicious presentation to my Easter table. Everyone raved about how moist and flavorful it was. Two ladies went home with the recipe. I omitted step 6. Thanks for a keeper Judy!

This cake was perfect it was moist and wonderful with ice cream on the side. The holes were the only problem if they are not wide enough the filling doesn't get in the cake. I used a skewer next time I will use a new screwdriver or letter opener unused. It would make a wider hole for the filling to get. It was a greate cake my guest just raved about it. Also I added more peach schnapps to the filling

What a very yummy cake this is!  I halved this, cooking it in a mini Bundt pan (an 8 cup size).  I can't imagine making the whole thing unless you have a super-sized crowd to sample it.  I skipped step 6 (which isn't even listed in the ingredients anyway), and I chose to include the zest IN the final glaze while leaving off the almonds on top.  I did use twice the amount of zest for each of the three segments.  I consider those changes to be minor ones.  If making the smaller cake, check for doneness at about 50 minutes (the touch test--if the top springs back lightly at touch, it's done).  I used a chop stick to make the holes to let the syrup seep in.  I thought this was a very good cake!  Thanks for this recipe!  EDIT:  I made a reduction of apricot nectar mixed with a little limoncello.  I served the cake with a little vanilla ice cream on top with the reduction drizzled down over it.  There wasn't a drop left on anyone's plate!

Amazing cake! Super yummy, and everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again. I might make a 1/2 recipe since this cake was too huge for my gatherings. Make sure you have a proper angel food cake pan or it may not come out in one piece. I used a bundt cake pan with a pattern on it, and some of it got stuck in the patterned  top. Still, delicious!

I have  made this cake twice since Thanksgiving. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter. It was tasty, everyone like it, and it was completely gone in 4 days. The second time, I tweaked the recipe to my liking and made a raspberry/orange glaze of my own invention and within 2 days it was gone!
Now my family wants to have this every month, not just on the holidays! Love it!!

It was a hit for a family gathering! I filled the hole in the center of the cake with the leftover brandy glaze and let it sit for a few hours - made for a very moist cake!
