I made this topping as written for two filet mignons wrapped in peppered bacon instead of ribeye steaks.  It was outstanding!  The blue cheese, horseradish, bread crumbs, and butter made an excellent combination of flavors with the bacon and steak.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  There is no need to spend outrageous sums of money going out for a steak dinner when you can make this dish for less and it will likely taste much better than the restaurant. Thanks for sharing Ski Mom.

Nice way to add extra flavor to a steak. This recipe definately makes more than enough for 4 steaks.

I thought it was ok but a little over the top for just two steaks. It easily could have been for four. I would have also cut the bread crumbs in half because it lost that melty creamy texture I was looking for.

This is so easy and makes a good steak restaurant quality. I have made it a few times already and we love it.

Tasty addition to your steak! Added mushrooms and a little “extra” blue cheese crumbles on top.

I made this to go on two filet mignon steaks cooked sous vide. The recipe made about twice as much as necessary, but it was absolutely amazing. Best steak I've ever had!

We made this crumble tonight on top of ribeye steaks.  We definitely enjoyed the topping but would reduce the bread crumbs the next time. The blue cheese and horseradish ratio was perfect. Thanks.
