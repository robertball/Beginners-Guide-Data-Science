I've used this easy sauce twice.  First time, it separated, and no one cared because it's all garlic, cheese, butter and green onions, so it has to be good.  The second time, I used more cheese, less butter.  It did not separate, it was delish again and it couldn't be easier with steak or roast beef.

This sauce had great flavor, but I had to double the amount of gorgonzola to get a sauce that was creamy rather than oily.  Next time I'll start by reducing the amount of butter to 2 tablespoons.

I served this with ribeye steak and my company was very impressed. It was fabulous. Make sure you use good, imported gorganzola.

My husband loved this!  It was full of flavor and complemented our steaks nicely.  I used 2.5 T of butter, 4 T of gorgonzola, 1 T of minced garlic (from the jar), approx 1/2 tsp of black pepper and approx 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.

I've used this sauce many times and I love it!! I like mine with less butter, and the amount of cheese depends on my mood ;) Sometimes I thin it out with milk or cream. This one is a keeper, thank you!

This recipe was quick, easy and tasted wonderful!  I added cooked, ground Italian sausage to it, doubled the garlic and served over pasta.

This sauce was really good. It was a little runny to put over pasta (I like it a little creamier) so I just added a bit of flour to it. I also added some sun-dried tomatoes to it as well. Delish!

This is so easy to make and delicious...I usually at least double the cheese. My boyfriend asks for it whenever we have steak, and he even puts it on baked potatoes. As another reviewer said, getting good quality Gorgonzola is the key!

I doubled the garlic (only because I'm a garlic freak), and the cheese.  I served over steak, and this was very good.  Next time I will serve over garlic bread, I had tried this in a restuarant in my area, and it was awesome.  Overall this is a good recipe if you like gorganzola.

This was absolutely delicious! I selected this recipe because it is simple, with few ingredients and quick. Put this over steak and it was better than anything we have ever had in a restaurant. Used slightly more gorgonzola and to prevent separating I continually stirred until heated and blended. Perfection.

This was a really good recipe. I enjoyed alot but we added a little parmesan cheese along to the sauce and it made it even better! Try adding a dash of parmesan and it makes the delicious recipe even better!

Amazing sauce!  One of my favorites for steaks, and fried ravioli's!  Be sure however to melt most of the cheese first alone before adding the butter and the other stuff, or else it will separate and won't be good!

This was delicious, and so easy and forgiving. I inadvertently turned the burner on too high, and as I was doing other things in the kitchen it began to boil. I thought it would be ruined but it was amazingly delicious - smooth, creamy, decadent. I didn't have green onion so I used about a tbsp of chopped shallot and it was a great substitute. My husband and I both used it on our steaks and baked potatoes. Tastes so gourmet that no one would ever guess it takes just five ingredients and five minutes to prepare.

Love This Sauce!  Instead of using it for a topping to meat (which is just as good), I quadrupled the ingredients and made a pasta dish.  I used 1lb of fettuccine noodles.  Added fresh vegetables (cooked according to your taste based on the vegetable) to the slow cooking sauce.  Served 6 people properly and was a huge hit!

This tasted ok, but seperated completely. I could have just as easily put butter in the pasta and then put gorgonzola on top. Kind of upset me since I made pasta with steak for my anniversary and was hoping this would be a good sauce on top. I tried adding extra gorgonzola and even a little flour like someone else said. Nothing helped. Next time I will just make an alfredo type of sauce and add gorgonzola to it.

Oh my god this is a great sauce.  We omitted the onions and added some more cheese to our taste, and we won't eat roast without it anymore.  It was so darn delicious!

YUM!  I was looking to re-create a sauce we had over chicken in a restaurant and this was pretty darn close.  I added pesto at the end to mimic the sauce from the restaurant...outstanding!

We put this stuff over everything... bread, asparagus, steak... The only downfall is calories and fat, and that it doesn't keep well. Must make and eat immediately. Delicious!

Tasty recipe, but it needs more gorgonzola to really bring out that flavor.  This is especially true if you are planning on putting that over a hearty meat like a steak (as I did).  Good start; needs a better finish.

This is a really good basic Gorgonzola saice, and very easy to make quickly. Experiment with it! I doubled the cheese, added a splash of whole milk and a splash of white wine, and some minced thyme.  It was great over grilled filet mignon last Saturday night.

Have made this 3 times already.  I use a minced garlic from a squeeze bottle.  Helps to keep things thick.  I also use more gorganzola than is called for.  I do it by taste though.

I followed the directions to a T because I've never made this before. It was very bland to me & then separated. I will look for another recipe for this sauce.

Using the modifications recommended (2.5 tbsp of butter, twice the cheese) it turned out perfectly. Just like the sauce served atop the nice restaurant near my home. Superb.

I added just a little bit of heavy cream. It was delicious.

This was a major hit! Hubby's words were this is "flippin" good! He then proceeded for seconds. I'm a saucy girl and added extra of everything (I wanted extra to sop up with garlic bread). The only thing I subbed was the green onion for shallots as that is what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

Easy.  I added more garlic and cut down butter to 2 tbsp, and increased cheese to 4 tbsp.  No green onion on hand, so used a little yellow onion.  Stirring constantly and quickly prevented it from separating.  Ate with steak.  I liked that this didn't require heavy cream.

Super easy sauce and it was delicious. Thank you for sharing! Like others, I doubled the cheese and reduced the butter although next time I will try nearly a half-and-half balance. I melted the cheese first before adding the other ingredients and had no issue with it separating. I thinned it with milk and served over pasta and Italian grilled chicken. Was just as good the next day for leftovers. I will definitely make again!

I first marinating my meat for 2 days and then at room temperature I seared the meat in a hot skillet to seal in the juices. Prior to this I had already sauteed and caramelized red and white onions and had set those aside. I removed the meat. Then as directed, I made the Gorgonzola cheese sauce and put my onions in and really clean the pan up of all the scrapings from the meat, brought sauce to a bubble and then poured it on top of the meat. I was very pleased with this cheese sauce. No constant stirring of flour. It was quick and easy. Very bountiful, and full of flavor. The sauce has a nice bite to it and it gives your taste buds a run for their money. With the sweet onion flavor and the pungent flavor of the cheese mixed with of course the meat being so tender left a nice taste in my mouth. Served with garlic mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and tomatoes sliced in my very own balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing with seasoning. Finished the dish with garlic bread on the side. Both thumbs up and Bon Appétit!

Wow! This has everything going for it: flavor, presentation & super easy to pull off! As others have done, I cut the butter down, and increased the gorgonzola. It's pretty forgiving! I used a 1/2 hunk of elephant garlic (we love garlic!) chopped. Sweated the hunks in butter for a minute or two, then added the rest of the ingredients. I used only green onion tops -- a bunch. And I really added lots more gorgonzola. Hub's comment: restaurant quality!  Delightful! Make it your own!!

Wonderful flavor! We loved it on pasta and added chopped up grilled chicken to the dish. My problem was I never solved the separating issue even by adding tons more gorgonzola. Maybe we neededto add flour? Most folks didnt have that problem so it must be something I was doing. Regardless, the taste is fabulous!!!

This was okay.  My nine year old really liked it.  Would not go out and buy gorganzola just for this recipe.  If you have extra on hand fine.  Not that great.
