Great recipe for a "Quick Breakfast"! I made this for my husband to take to work. I added just a touch of milk to the eggs to get them nice and fluffy. I also used the recipe for "Herbie's Home Fries" on this site to add a little pizzaz to "cooked and diced" potatoes. All that was left to do was add some cheddar cheese and ham. This is a great base for whatever add-in's such as cheeses, veggies, or breakfast meats you choose. Definitely a great "on-the-go" breakfast meal!

I've made a dish like this before but my boyfriend doesn't eat eggs. Crumbled up, sauteed tofu (with garlic, onion and spices) makes a delicious subsitute for the egg. Yum yum!

This was okay but the potatoes made the pita really dense.  I thought it would be better with the scrambled eggs and something like tomato or broccoli.  Then serve the potatoes on the side.  But the pita was very filling with the potatoes so it is good for a hearty breakfast.

We made this as is, except added another egg for 1 1/2 per person.  Well, I have to say that I was blown away!  Not that this recipe is all that complex, but the idea is so gooooood.  Don't know why, it just seemed to sit well with me.  Very well!  Oh, and make sure to let the potatoes get nice and brown- that seemed to add a lot of flavor.

My husband loved this recipe...if you don't add any "extras" it's a wonderful low point Weight watchers breakfast!

A good recipe, but it can be made much better by adding chopped cooked bacon, sausage patty or link into the skillet when cooking the eggs. Divide the egg minture into the pitas and top with a little shredded cheese.  Much more flavor! For a lower calorie/less fat version, I've also make these with egg substitute and veggie sausage patties or bacon. If I'm out of pita bread, I've used toasted English muffins instead.  Very versatile recipe!!

Thanks for the great idea!  I added some garlic powder and a few dashes of Tapatio.  It was fantastic!

Not bad, a little dry. Much improved by topping with chunky salsa.

This was rather tasty and a good way to use up some of the leftovers.  The only problem with the recipe is that it is a bit dry as is, but this is easily solved with some bbq sauce or mayo.  Will play around with this some more next time I have leftover potatoes.

This was good as written. I found 2 eggs just right to fill the pita with the combination of suggested potato.  So many additions you can do on this according to your tastes. The basic recipe is a great foundation for change or just by itself.

I cook jalapenos, onions, green pepper, tomatoes and fresh garlic with the potatoes, cook chorizo with egg and monterey jack cheese, put the potatoes at the bottom and the egg and cheese mixture on the top. Makes for a spicy breakfast and a quick breakfast if you have those leftover potatoes!

I used the cheesy herbed eggs recipe to give this more flavor, sprinkled with cheddar cheese and ranch dressing.  Kids liked these but like breakfast tortilla roll ups better because they are easier to handle than the pita bread.

Not bad at all! I added too much potato, but that was my own fault. I added ketchup and guacamole to mine. Yum! :) Very easy too!

This is really great as it is - sprinkled with a little cheese it was even better :)  Definitely will be making this one again.  I only used 1 egg and used a whole potato so my ratio of potato was probably a little higher.  It's a great grab and go meal that will keep the McGreasy off your hips!

Are we sure about the calories? Made it this morning, I used 3 egg whites rather than 2 whole eggs, and added in some tomatoes. If I count the calories all together it ends up being about the right calories... but that's WITHOUT the yolk. Eggs WITH the yolk practically go over the calorie amount listed, without all of the other ingredients. It was still a quick and easy breakfast. May season more next time... but will be making it again. Thanks for sharing.

This isn't so good.  Just a basic scrambled potato-and-egg.  No seasoning whatsoever.  Made a huge mess in the pan.  Temperature too high to warm the pita -- it came out toasted so that it couldn't be filled without cracking open.
Had to use the pita as just an accompanying piece of bread, and got out the jar of salsa for flavor.
