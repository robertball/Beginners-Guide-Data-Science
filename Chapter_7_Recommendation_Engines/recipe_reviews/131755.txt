This recipe is awesome.  I always run out of ways to cook venison, which is why I chose this and I'm glad I did.  I had to change a few minor things just for lack of ingredients in the household.  First, I used about 1/2 a yellow onion instead of the green onion and onion powder.  Instead of beef broth, I used a little more than two cups of water, along with 3 beef boullion cubes.  I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic when browning the venison.  It was perfect with mashed potatoes.  In case you don't have white wine, a dry red would work also, just with different results.

Loved this! the only thing i changed was to use diced garlic instead of powder. THe key ingredient to this dish is the wine;it tenderizes the venison. thanks for sharing

nice sauce for deer tenderloins. Very tasty and it did not overpower the meat with too many additional flavours. Thanks for the recipe

I am NOT the biggest fan of venison, it's too gamey for my tastes, but this was very tasty!  I had to use what I had in the house, so I used beef bouillion and water instead of beef broth and canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  I had some leftover venison tenderloin and added enough venison butterfly steaks from the freezer to make a pound.  I kept the amounts of everything else the same and simmered on the stove for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  I thickened the extra sauce make a yummy gravy and served it over brown rice.  Very tender!  This recipe definitely is a keeper!

I changed the recipe a little bit.  I took all of the ingredients called for and stuffed it in a crock pot.  I turned it on low for the day.  I did put regular garlic instead of the powder, and I added a little wine and broth since I was leaving it in the crock pot all day.  It was good.  It reminded me of pot roast a little bit.  I served over potatos.  Next time I am going to serve over wild rice as suggeseted by another reviewer.

I had never cooked venison before, and was not sure if I would even like it, but this recipe was awesome! I didn't simmer it for nearly as long as it suggested, and it still came out great!

This turns out almost like venison stew and I've gotten similar results with a lot less work.  We used several different kinds of mushrooms which made it more interesting.  Used Jacob's Creek Chard for the wine which was very good.  We doubled the recipe and served over wild rice.  Overall it was good but again, it takes more work and time than it's worth to us.  I was somewhat disappointed after reading such great reviews.

What a wonderful change from our usual fried venison. After we made this we gave the recipe to three different hunters in the family. It was absolutly fabulous. I added a little corn starch to thicken and served with some garlic mashed potatoes, yummy!!

This was sooo good!  Thank you for sharing.  I will use this one again.  It will be a great recipe to make when we have guests that say they don't like venison.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this!  Thanks again!

I've cooking venison for years.  This is a tasty recipe and a keeper.  Good enough for company.  I just thicken up the sauce before serving.

My husband loves this recipe! I substituted fresh garlic for dried and dried parsley for  fresh. I also used sherry instead of dry white wine.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the new favorite!

I was given 5 lbs of venison, I made a stew, and a burgundy sauce. This was the perfect change that was needed. Served it over wild rice and it was delicious. Next time I will use olive oil for an even healthier entr√©e
