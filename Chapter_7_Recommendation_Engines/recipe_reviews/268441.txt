Delicious and easy to make!
Next time, I'll mix the sliced persimmons with the sugar mixture in a bowl first, and then pour into the crust. This way all the persimmons are coated.

Two persimmon trees in yard. Lots of persimmons so we made two pies! Took them to a party where there were other pies--ours were gone before we went home!
Super easy, too!

Simple, and delicious! Much better, in my opinion, that the typical pureed persimmon fillings, which always seem "thin" in flavor, this is buttery-persimmony but the lemon juice keeps it from being too rich or cloying.
