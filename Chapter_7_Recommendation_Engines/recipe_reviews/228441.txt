Wow!  I followed the recipe exactly (I made a double batch) and my family gobbled it up!  My husband said he thought he didn't like cabbage... but with recipes like this he'd change his mind.  Easy and delicious, thanks!

This was ok... I really like cabbage and cheese so this really peeked my interest..however... the two aren't necessarily good together.. It was ok but not good..  the two textures didn't necessarily complement each other. Sorry I really hate to not give a good review but with this one I really just can't ... sorry.. but maybe it's just me... you decide...
