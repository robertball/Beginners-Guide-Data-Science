This is great.  I actually used the almonds oil and kosher salt but instead of the other stuff, I used smoked paparika.  They are great.  I am giving this 5 stars because it is a recipe that lends itself to all kinds of versions of roasted nuts...just use your imagination!

Wonderful, wonderful wonderful!!!!! Made these for a get together and everyone asked for the recipe. So easy. Left them in about 25 minutes because they were raw. Will be a staple in recipe repertoire.Thank you for submitting this!

Don't use fresh rosemary, it tends to burn and shrivel up!  The kosher salt may taste better but I found table salt or freshly ground salt sticks to the nuts better than kosher.  Very addicting and nibble worthy.

Very Good. I made these for Christmas gifts with slivered almonds, to be eaten out of hand or as salad toppers. To chop the rosemary, I just put the leaves in the food processor with the oil and garlic and whirled it around. Probably will use less oil next time, since I cooled them on paper towels to get rid of some grease. These are very pretty made with slivered almonds by the way.

I made these to snack on during our family Christmas eve celebration, and found them extremely simple to put together. My only problem was that the garlic seemed to burn before the almonds were done, which gave the finished product an interesting flavor. I also didn't have any fresh rosemary sprigs on hand, so I used about 1/2 tsp. of dried crushed rosemary instead, which worked just fine. Altogether, this is an extremely quick, easy, and healthy snack. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

Quick and tasty snack. I liked Joan's idea of using smoked paprika, so that's what I did. 1 tsp, with the oil, salt and 1/8 tsp garlic powder. I used raw almonds, so increased the baking time as suggested, to 15 minutes, which was almost too much, so I'm not sure that's neccesary. When they came out of the oven, I sprinkled them with about an addtitional 1/2 tsp of paprika and tossed them again in the same bowl.

I made these with raw almonds and left them in the oven for entirely waaaaaay too long (25 minutes as suggested by a review).  They ended up burnt, but we ate them anyway (partly because almonds are expensive)!  I love almonds and this recipe sounds really good so I will try it again!!!

I thought these almonds were really tasty and easy to make.  I made them for a snack bowl and people loved them.  The kosher salt is very important, but some will also sink to the bottom of the bowl after a while.

I ADORED these almonds! I am looking for nice healthy snacks to make and this fitted the bill perfectly. As I am just learning my way around a kitchen, I appreciated the simplicity of these almonds. I used sea salt instead of kosher as this is what the general australian grocery shop has. Delicious!

These are pretty darn yummy!
I had raw almonds so I kept them in the oven for about 22 mins which was perfect, just keep an eye on them if you do not want them to burn. Every Oven is different.

These were terrific! I used a chipotle seasoning instead of rosemary-just a personal preference. As another reviewer suggested, after they cooked for  ten minutes , I turned off the oven and left them in for another five. Iâ€™ll be making these again!

Slightly greasy, next time more almonds or less oil. Also used chili lime seasoning in place of salt. Fairly tasty, could use a bit more flavor. I think that dried rosemary would actually work better as the flavor was a tad bitter.

Very easy and will make again.     Baked for 10 minutes as directed which seemed too quick from other trials.   Turned the oven off and left almonds in for another 5 minutes - perfect.

I made these for a party I had and everyone loved them so much that I was asked to move them otherwise they'd be all gone by one person.  They are addicting .
