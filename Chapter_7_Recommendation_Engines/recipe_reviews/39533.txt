My mother taught me to make this when we were short on cash.  We typically make our own cream sauce by whisking 1 tablespoon of butter with 2 tablespoons of flour and then very slowly adding a total of 2 cups of milk until it thickens.  Whisk the flour and butter mixture constantly while adding the milk to reduce lumps. Then simmer it a bit and as it thickens add the tuna, we use two cans drained and then add a can of peas and salt and pepper.  This will always be a favorite of mine.  Thanks for posting.

This is a great quick and easy meal.  We adapt it for dinner by adding a can of drained peas and pouring over cooked rice or noodles.  If you like, spice it up with a bit of ground red pepper. You can use any creamed soup you have on hand, we like cream of mushroom esp. with dinner.

This get 5 stars because it was a favorite childhood friday night supper.  My mother always made the roux for a creamy white sauce instead of using creamed soup.  We never had it on bread, rice, or potatoes.  We had it on crushed potato chips!!  Yes, try it before you scoff.  It is delicious!!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and boy, I'm glad I did.  I added a small onion, diced, a can of baby peas, lots of garlic and onion powder, and went heavy on the black pepper.  I also only used about 1/2 cup of milk.  To be honest, I thought it was still a bit "bland" but my husband LOVED it.  It was really true comfort food, for sure!

This recipe was good for something fast.  The only change I will make next time I make this is to add less milk.  It was really runny.  Overall a good quick recipe.

Added a couple of chopped up green onions, a little garlic powder, peas and carrots.  Used crm of mush soup.  Served open face over white toast.  Thus "TUNA on a SHINGLE"  / 04-15-2010 I'm not that crazy about crm of mush soup [ it was all I had] so I put in the blender first so I don't have to look at the little mushroom bits.

I used cream of mushroom(don't like celery) didn't use milk either but added chopped red onion for crunch and ate it "open-face" with a slice of fresh tomato. 
Very good. Glad for change on the regular tuna salad. Thanks!

This is the only way my kids will eat tuna.  However, instead of using creamy celery soup, we make a white sauce using bacon grease, flour, salt, pepper and milk...I guess it's more of a gravy than a white sauce, but it's delicious!

My dad used to make something similar for me when I was a little girl.  He (and now I) combined one can drained tuna with one can of Campbell Cream of Mushroom soup, and heat through.  Then toast and butter four slices of bread, and smother with sauce.  Voila! Tuna fish on toast.

Thanks for sharing. Like the other reviewer I made my own cream sauce with milk, flour, & butter. Besides the salt & pepper I added garlic powder and onion powder (1/4 tsp each). Hubby said it hit the spot!

Wonderful! I added extra tuna and less milk so it was a bit more solid, along with green onions, shredded sharp cheddar, and garlic powder. I combined the leftovers with cooked pasta for a lovely little lunch the next day.

this recipe was a bit bland. I kick it up a bit. It was a weeknight staple when I was a kid...and also when I raised my own 5. I made it with a white sauce, added frozen peas, a can of button mushrooms, and a couple of quartered hardboiled eggs. Would sometimes add sliced green olives too. Served it over two slices of toast. My kids loved it! Now they're all raised, but my husband still asks for it! He also loves tuna/noodle casserole, which tastes very similar.

I really wish they made a low sodium version of cream of celery soup so because they don't, I used cream of mushroom instead. As others suggested, I added a can of baby peas and more seasonings. Total comfort food and thank you!

Great easy recipe. I added corn to the tuna mix. Then I put the bread into muffin tins, spoon the tuna mixture into the bread cups, put grated cheese over them and bake them for about 20-30 mins at 350. Then they come out like tuna pockets.

Um guys....it's not SUPPOSED to be a sandwich, it's creamed tuna ON toast (not IN it).....that being said, it is still to runny for my liking and the taste was blah.  Don't care to make again.

My mom made this alot and we kids LOVED it.  She never used the soup,like others have said she used corn starch and a small amount of water or milk to make the roux.  I am gonna give it a try with the soup sounds good.  My mom also used peas & carrots out of the can not just peas. Mom was a single parent with 3 kids and this made a meal and stretched a dollar.

My Daddy use to make this when I was a kid. This recipe is almost bang on to my Daddy's. I only made a few additions. I added chopped hard boiled eggs and to counter the strong celery taste I added a small amount of sugar. It was super delish, thanks for sharing this recipe that brings back so many memories. Also very good served over egg noodles.

I usually only have tuna in a sandwich and chopped egg pieces. Finally I went on this site and found the most delicious tuna recipe ever! Personally I put 2 cans of tuna and 1/2 a can of cream of celery because it was too watery. I made it thick enough that I could put it on a sandwich and take it to lunch. I was so sick of eating the same tuna fish salad sandwich that this recipe was a pleasant change.

I rated 5 but I changed the recipe and left out the milk.  I actually just threw together a can of tuna to a can of condensed soup and heated it up.  The milk would have made it way too runny.

MY husband was thrilled!  His Mom made this when he was a kid and the toaster never stopped!  I, too, used cream of mushroom soup and shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added two extra cans of tuna and spiced it up a bit with Mrs. Dash's lemon pepper.  I will use less milk next time I make this.  Thanks for the recipe; so easy and quick!

This was a super fast tasty lunch. Followed the recipe to a T and was not disappointed. The other upside to this is that its sooooo cheap to make. Literally less than 2 bucks for the dish to feed 4 people you can't get much cheaper than that. I served with a nice green salad for lunch.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it using cream of mushroom soup, and added some chopped garlic, onions, carrots and peas to it.  Served over fresh homemade cheese biscuits... delicious!

This turned out more like soup.  I could not put it on a sandwich, it was too runny.  It needs a lot less milk.  The flavor was good.

....I did not follow the recipe as I grew up on creamed tuna on toast made with flour/butter/milk.  I used 2 cans tuna (12 oz) packed in water, drained, plus 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of celery soup, and 1 can of skim milk.  I first lightly sautéed a little onion and garlic, added the tuna, and soups and slowly added the milk along with oregano, black pepper, thyme and the secret ingredient to make this dish Wow!!!....a little .Worchestershire sauce and a couple of chopped up hard boiled eggs!!!   ...and it turned out to be more than 5 star!!!!!!

I love creamed tuna. Cream of celery is a nice difference to the meal. My mom always made a roux and used cream of mushroom soup and milk. That allowed her to make more and still have it nice and creamy. I don't put it on the toast but have toast on the side or cook up some Jasmine rice and peas. If you put it on egg noodles it's like a quick little tuna casserole :o)

Nothing gourmet, but a good, quick easy meal.  I added peas and a slice of cheese on top of each piece of toast.  This is a great recipe when you need to make dinner with what you have on hand.  Thanks!

Pretty good for an extremely quick low-fat dinner.  I sauteed a little onion and celery and then added the milk, soup and tuna.  I served it over toast with a fat-free piece of cheese on it and shook quite a bit of black pepper on it.  No need to add salt as there is already plenty of sodium in this one!

In my humble beginnings, this was a meal that was often served at home; it's economical, filling, and fast. It's not gourmet, but it is good.   Hadn't had it with canned soup, which is a very clever idea; I used mushroom soup as another reviewer suggested, and it was good.  I also added peas, and believe it or not, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Boyfriend is looking forward to the leftovers. Thank you for the post!

Boy did this recipe bring back memories. This was a frequent Friday night supper when I was a kid. My Mom would make it with cream of mushroom soup and serve it over mashed potatoes with peas on the side. Yum! Growing up Catholic meant no meat on Fridays. This was an economical meal and it was my favorite. Would make a good Lenten meal.

Reduced milk to 1/2 cup, added peas & chopped onions, and more spice - as suggested per many reviews. Served over brown rice.  Perfect for when you're short on time!

Very easy and very good. This is a great pantry meal that can be prepared at a moment’s notice. I served it over rice and it was delicious.

This was a childhood favorite of mine.  Except my mother would make a homade white sauce and finished it off with fresh parsley.  The parsley is a definite must!

This is very tasty. I've been looking for ways to add fish to my diet and this is a quick and easy one. I cut the milk in half and doubled the tuna. I also added some chopped onion.

My father made a recipe similar to this and I just wanted to make a suggestion! 

I'm not sure how he creamed his tuna but he would add frozen peas. 

Then he would serve over baked potato instead of toast. It's actually quite good with the baked potato!! 

My mother hated the recipe. My father remembered a similar recipe from his navy days in Vietnam.
