This was a very good recipe although kindof time consuming to make. My son thought it was too spicy but it was a great recipe for the adults!

Great recipe for using up garden zucchini!  I made a few adjustments - added 2 jalapeno peppers, used less olive oil and a lot more cumin.  Otherwise followed recipe. Will make again but next time, I probably won't put it in the oven since I think it is great just as a stir fry.  Great with diced tomatoes and lots of fresh cilantro on top.

I really liked this.. I used ground turkey and probably more zucchini than the recipe called for. I forgot the corn and topped this with a mexican cheese blend. I have some leftovers so it hink I will put them in wraps and have them for work lunches next week. Made this again...almost 3 years later, Subbed hominy for corn and used chicken,. Stll delish. I like that it doesnt use a lot of cheese

This was very good, and I'd certainly make it again. I found that I needed to add liquid to the pan several times. I had a bit of vegetable broth that I added while sauteing the vegetables and then when I added the tomato paste I needed to mix in some water. Even with the addition of liquid, it still was a bit dry after baking. I think next time I'll use a can of Rotel with the juices instead of the tomato paste. All in all, this recipe is easily adaptable to your liking and we all enjoyed it served over quinoa.

What a great way to use some of the extra squash from the garden!   On top of that the taste was great also.   Easy to make recipe and the flavors blend well.  Must say the left overs were outstanding the next day both cold and warmed.  Thanks for the wonderful easy meal recipe.

This was one of those nights where "I have w, x, y, and z to use up... let's see if I can find a recipe to use them all."  Often those experiments turn out *meh*, but this was a pleasant surprise!

OK, I admit I made quite a few tweaks, but I think I kept the 'essence' of the recipe the same. It turned out great!  As written, I think there is far too much chili powder, especially considering the jalapeno (I used some roasted medium/hot hatch chilies, which were great with a decent amount of kick).  I used about 1.5 teaspoons of chili powder and 1.5 teaspoons of cumin, which balanced with the other chilies was great for my taste preferences.  I did need quite a bit of salt though.  

I used three zucchini which I would call 'average' size which equaled about 8 cups of chopped.  I was a bit worried that this would make it a "zucchini with a little bit of other stuff" dish, but the ratios actually turned out great.  

I also used two ears of fresh corn, 4 cups of black beans (no kidney), yellow onion instead of green, green instead of red pepper, can of diced tomatoes instead of paste, and shredded mex cheese because that's what I had on hand.  I didn't bake it, but served it up chili style with a dollop of sour cream and tortilla chips to dip.  Mmm mmm good!

Tex-Mex Squash Bake Haiku: "I made this in half. And swapped out Parmesan too. Didn't think it'd jive." For the flavors going into this, I was skeptical about using Parmesan, so I went with a Mexi-blend of shredded cheese instead. Halving the recipe (using black bean) made an ideal amount, but it got a bit dry in the oven, without having any moisture (diced tomatoes or tomato sauce, maybe?) It tasted good, and I was happy to use a pile of zucchini that my garden recently exploded with, but I think next time I'll just let it warm in the skillet mixed together and just let cheese melt on top at serving. Oh and it was nummy to scoop it up with a blob of salsa onto a tortilla chip.

Based on other reviews, I skipped baking this.  Instead, I made it in a cast iron skillet on the stove top, then stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the cheese.  I topped mine with a squeeze of lime juice and crumbled tortilla chips and it was very good.

I Followed This Recipe Perfectly.  It came out dry and not good.  Put some salsa in it to moisten It but it still not good. Never would make it again.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I have an abundance of zucchini from my garden and this was a perfect way to use it up.  I made it as written, except I forgot the garlic (will definitely include that next time), and I didn't have cilantro...but I served it up with fresh diced tomatoes on top after it was done cooking and my husband and two small children both loved it!  Next time I'll add an extra jalapeno for a little more kick.
