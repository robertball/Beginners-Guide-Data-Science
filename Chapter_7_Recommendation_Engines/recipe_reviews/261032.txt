Excellent! I did use the entire packet of taco seasoning and because the avocados at the store were way overripe I left them out and added some cilantro instead. The shells do better at 400 degrees (the recipe submitter has a separate recipe just for the shells and the directions on that one say 400). Here is a tip that I discovered by accident. You can only fit 2 shells on the handle of a wooden spoon. I wanted all 4 of my shells to be done at the same time but couldn't find another spoon that didn't have a funky shaped handle. Out of desperation I started digging around in the junk drawer and saw my wooden ruler and decided to use it. The end result  was a stand up on its own taco shell. How perfect is that? One other recommendation I have is to blot some of the excess grease from the shells with a paper towel prior to forming them around your spoon handle/ruler. This was a great recipe and one I will make a lot. Thanks for sharing!

I would next time add less salt and add sour cream.

I also used Munster and parmesan cheese for the shells since I did not have enough cheddar and added jalapenos.

Very good. Used my own taco seasoning.  The shells needed to cook at 400

Used 4-cheese Mexican instead of straight Cheddar and tacos wouldn’t stay folded... tastes great though!

While it was fun making taco shells using cheddar cheese, the end result was way too greasy. I’ll stick with corn tortilla shells in the future.

The cheese tasted strange, the meat was dry and tasteless and the cheese 'tacos' never materialized. Just stayed soupy and never held shape.  If doing this again, I would use parmesan, add something to moisten the meat. I fully admit that I could have done something wrong but I didn't like the taste of the cheese, one of my favorite things in the world.

Loved the flavor -- created with my own spice mix and the cheese taco shells were great.  A bit messy to figure out how to do it the first time but thanks for the tips you gave us.
