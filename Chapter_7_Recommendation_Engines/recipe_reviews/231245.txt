This was delicious. I liked the tang of the sour cream. I had a little bit of ricotta to use up so that went in too. I would like to make this again soemtime, but I would add a green veggie and use a spicier sausage for my tastes

Used this as a base receipe and made a little change.  Used 5 eggs and CHORIZO (new from Jimmy Dean).  It was awesome, served with Salsa / Sour Cream /Guac -- Made it a Mexican Quiche.  Great base recipe.  If you use the Chorizo it's takes on a golden color versus yellow.

This recipe is excellent! I made it for dinner but added to my breakfast recipes because it is glutton free and better than many breakfast casseroles that I have made. 
I did not have two kinds of cheese so I used pepper jack cheese. I didn't add hot sauce because my family doesn't like spicy hot. 
I sauteed the peppers and onions while the sausage was cooking and then added it to the sausage. Also, I didn't drain all the grease from the sausage so it turned out juicy but not too greasy. YUM! I added Cheddar Bay Biscuits (box mix like what they serve at Red Lobster) to the meal with a salad.

This is an amazing recipe.  So versatile.  I had a can of spam so I chopped that up and saut√©ed it with some onions and chopped garlic and chopped green peppers.  Threw it into the mix.  House smelled wonderful while it cooked.  Tasted great.  Recipe made enough for a delicious breakfast and lunch for my husband and I.  Will double it next time to feed extended family.

Great basic recipe!  I use whatever cheese I have on hand and add more eggs, usually 4 more.  Always turns out great!

I made this along with another quiche from this site for a girls get away weekend and they were both loved by all. I didn't change a thing in this recipe. the only reason I only gave it 4 stars is that the other recipe (Spinach and Mushroom Quiche) was all gone and there were a few pieces of this pie leftover.
