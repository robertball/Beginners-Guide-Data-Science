Lackluster. Needed to be spiced up. Used some spaghetti sauce I had lying around and extra basil and garlic.

I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour ( I choose the
 seasonings for the flour). I also used Garlic oil instead of vegetable oil and saut√©ed onions and garlic  with the chicken.  I added canned mushrooms to the soup mixture. I felt this  gave recipe favor it needed.
