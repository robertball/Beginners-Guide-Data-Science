LOVED these!  I love anything green tea, and am a huge muffin fan, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  They are pretty dense, which is how I like 'em.  I only made a few minor changes:  I always use whole wheat flour and Smart Balance - I doubled the green tea to 2 T. (I also used the tea from tea bags this first time even though I have matcha - might use that next time to compare), doubled the walnuts, chopped VERY finely (I usually leave nuts completely out of recipes, but they're perfect here), and added 2 tsp. of vanilla.  I think the baking time/temperature is bit off - I would recommend either 350 degrees for 20 minutes, or 325 degrees for 25 minutes.  And because of the green tea, walnuts, and whole wheat flour, it's a bit hard to tell when they're done by color/browning alone.  The muffins are a a little small - for this amount of batter, I would normally make 8 or 9 generous muffins.  Still overall a GREAT recipe!

Just a warning: powdered matcha tea is very expensive. $30 for a small can. I tried just using regular green tea leaves (cutting open a tea bag) and the muffins were still good, but imparted no extra flavor.

These are great for breakfast! I prefer them as mini-muffins (325° for about 18 minutes). I also double the matcha and cut the sugar (I use turbinado) by half. Instead of walnuts, I add chopped pecans, hemp seed, sunflower seed and ground flax seed. Wonderful and nutritious! They are delicious warmed with butter.

These turned out a very pretty shade of green.  They're to the dense/chewy side rather than a light/cakey muffin.  Delicately flavored.  I didn't add the walnuts, but I think they'd be a nice addition.  A winner!

These are very good muffins! I realized too late that what I had was matcha leaves and not powder, but I did as a previous reviewer and just ground them. It doesn't get the nice color, unfortunately, but they are very pretty still. The walnuts add a LOT to this and definitely should be added. I also reduced the flour a little, substituted some butter for oil, and some maple syrup for sugar to try to make them moister. I made mini muffins-- 13-14 minutes was enough bake time.

After following the recipe to a "T" (which is how I think these recipes should always be reviewed), there's really not a lot of flavor to these. Personally I couldn't taste the matcha in them at all, just a slight hint of sugar. I'd definitely double up the green tea next time. These did bake up nicely in 25 mins though, very moist and no hint of brown, just a pretty green colour.

I love matcha, and matcha muffin is one tender treat to go for. I don't know if it was the matcha powder that made the muffins quite dense, but I like the taste anyway. Sometimes I replaced some butter with applesauce, sometimes I made vanilla-matcha marble cupcake, just so many ways to enjoy matcha :)

Quite tasty!  I used agave nectar to sweeten instead of sugar, I also replaced 2/3 cup of all purpose flour with whole grain flour.  (wanted this to be a healthier option for my 3 year old to snack on) You can really taste the Matcha, yum!

These were really yummy!  I didn't use walnuts in mine as I don't like nuts in any of my baked goods, and used light vanilla Silk instead of milk.  I had to bake mine for about 30mins total as well.  They came out a dense, moist muffin with a delicate flavor.  Will definitely be making these again!

Very good muffins for those who like green tea (such as the Hubster & I)!  The flavor is subtle at first, but livens right up as you eat them.  The walnuts add the perfect flavor to these muffins so don't pass on them!  We liked that they were not too sweet.  They're also not "cakey" muffins, so expect them to be more dense than other muffins.  Will definitely make again.  The Hubster loved the "Shrek" color.  Thanks for the fun new recipe!  :)

The muffin didn't taste like muffin nor did it raise like one. It was dense, kind of like a mochi.

I was very unpleased with this recipe. The result was very very dense, even thought I increased the baking powder to 1 and half tsp. As many people mentioned dryness, I reduced the flour to 1 and half cups. It wasn't dry, but it was just so dense that it couldn't have been dry anyway. I like my green tea taste a little stronger, so I increased the powder to 3 tablespoons. That was probably the only saving grace of the whole result- it had a nice green tea flavor. But this recipe is not even worth retrying, there are so many better recipes out there that won't yield such a dense result without a bunch of modifications. Very disappointing.

My co-workers loved these!  They are a very moist and dense muffin, but it works well!  I did use oil instead of butter and added about a tablespoon of vanilla.

These were pretty dry and bland. Next time I make Matcha Muffins I think I'll tweak this a bit to see if it works out better the second time around.

I agree with the others that this turns out pretty dense but I found that using cake flour makes it fluffy if you want to avoid that (I also reduced the amount of butter).
Also agree that the matcha needs to be doubled to get that flavor. You definitely need to sift the flour and matcha together otherwise you'll get matcha lumps. Pretty average recipe otherwise but I liked it because it was simple.

My kids love green tea this recipe hit the spot. My 12 year old insisted it tasted just like a muffin version of her favorite green tea mochi. I made them exactly how written and chose to add the optional walnuts.

Super easy! We usually go vegan, so I substituted the egg with tofu, and increased the matcha to1 1/2 tbsp, for more flavor.  They came out great!

Thanks to other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1 1/2c flour, 1.5T Green tea powder, 1.5t Baking powder, skipped the nuts and baked at 350 degree for 20 min.  It came out perfect!  Kind of cakey instead of a dense muffin, but I like it.  I did decrease to 1/3c sugar because of my family's taste, it's just lightly sweet, and we can smell the fragrant green tea.  Not sure if this made a difference, I creamed the butter with sugar first, than beat in egg, finally mixed in milk and powders.

The muffins were ok, but I couldn't taste the green tea flavor at all. They tasted like regular muffins, except they looked green. Probably wouldn't make it again.

First, thanks for sharing the recipe.
However, it is not a good recipe for me. I have added the double amount of the matcha green tea powder(around 2-1/2 tbsp), but it came out no taste of it. They don't really look like "muffins". The "muffin" is really chewy, not the texture of a muffin/cake.
Anyways, thanks for the recipe!
