This was a pleasant chilled side dish to grilled BBQ'd bone-in chicken breast.  The shoepeg corn is crisp, and the dressing has a nice tang to it.  This was a welcome  change from my typical mac or potato salad that I often serve with grilled chicken.  Thanks, HotGrandma, for sharing your recipe.

Simple and refreshing recipe. I opted not to do the Jalopena peppers and replaced with chopped bacon pieces which was great. This is a keeper for me.

Tasty and easy to make, well received by picnic guests.  I use three cans of rinsed sweet corn as Shoepeg is very hard to find here, and the larger size can.  Just 2 small cans leaves the corn swimming in runny dressing.
Tastes best after sitting for 4-5 hours.

Super easy - SUPER TASTY!!!  I made this for my husband and I to try first.  He tried to eat a huge helping before I even put in the fridge for a few hours.  Perfect change for a cookout or cover dish.  I followed the directions - no changes and will not make any.  
Will def make again and again!!

Thanks, HappyGrandma for a new, terrific summer salad.  I didn't have shoepeg corn, but did have a 12oz. bag of frozen corn that I thawed and drained.  I then proceeded with the recipe and let it chill about 3 hours.  We both really enjoyed this dish along with 'Chili-Lime Chicken Kabobs' and 'Roasted Cauliflower 'Steaks'' from AR.  This salad would be great for a party or carry-in as the colors of the dish make for a very pretty presentation.

Would probably add more corn since it was kind of "soupy."  Great flavor, though!

I was hopeful this would be tasty as I read the ingredients, so I tried the recipe.  I am not impressed enough to make it again. Maybe a few tweaks to "brighten" the taste would make a difference, but that's not worth it to me.

This has an excellent flavor. I added a cup of small pasta shells to make it more of a meal. The jalapeno peppers give it just enough heat. This will be one of my favorites.

A perfect blend of comforting mayo and spices! I wouldn't call this a salad, and would recommend eating this with tortilla chips as a salsa!

I used 6 ears of fresh corn that I had boiled quickly to cook the corn.  This was a delicious side dish for our lunch.

This recipe was really good!  Except being I’m not a fan of spicey I left out the jalapeños and just cut up some red pepper.  I will make this again.  I loved it!

This is an awesome recipe. So refreshing on a hot Summer evening. I made according to the recipe with one exception after reading reviews. I did use 3 cans of shoe peg corn. This recipe is a keeper! Delicious!!! Enough for a group gathering.

This was pretty good.  Made with fresh tomato.  Would probably have been better with fresh corn.  Will keep on my "make again" list.

I made this on July 4th for a large party. Everyone loved it. I used canned white corn and canned yellow corn. The only thing I'll do different next time, I'll add some chopped cilantro. I think that'll taste good added in.

Very good and different! There are only two of us so I cut the amount of dressing in half and eyeballed the amount of fresh corn. After letting the salad rest for a while I added some seedless cucumber (we have an abundance this summer that need to go away!) and some crisp bacon because life is good when bacon is involved. Thanks so much for the recipe - it's a keeper!
