This was quite good but not spicy enough for me. The recipe itself could be written better....let the beans boil for a few minutes so that it thickens otherwise you will just have beans and broth.  Also 1 egg was not enough for the amount of shrimp.

I did not care for this recipe. This was not easy to make, and in my opinion it has too many steps for a disappointing end product.

Actually, I loved the recipe, except for the part of frying the shrimp.    I sauteed the shrimp in the skillet after crisping the basil, garlic, etc.      I served this in a large pasta bowl with polenta as the base.  Then added the beans to the dish.  Then the shrimp.  Then the topping.   Everyone loved it.
