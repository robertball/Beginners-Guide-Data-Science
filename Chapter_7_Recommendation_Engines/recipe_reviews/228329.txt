I'm giving this recipe a benefit of the doubt by giving it a four-star rating.  I think that anyone familiar with teff or brown rice flour would have to know what they are getting into by choosing this recipe to make.  The texture is dry, heavy, and grainy, but there is a good sweetness offered by all the fruits that are added to it.  Maybe I made a mistake by using a substitute given on the Internet by using cornstarch instead of the elusive arrowroot flour (not one of five stores I checked out had it).  And I used walnuts rather than pecans.  I probably will be eating these by myself, as other family members find the texture off-putting.  Hearty is a good word for these.  With a little butter melted into them, I will have a number of good bites to go with my morning coffee!  Thanks so much for the new possibilities here!  EDIT:  I have to tell you that when I want something to eat in the morning that will stay with me, this is the perfect thing!  I'm glad I froze them!  They are good with a little jam or lemon curd or butter on them.  Thanks again!

This recipe is similar to the one on the Bob red mills bag except it has no sugar and lots of dry fruit. The recipe is good but since a previous commenter stated they were dry I decided to use applesauce instead of the water it called for. I didn't have all the dried fruits so to sweeten mine up I added 1/4 cup of agave.  I also added 1 finely grated carrot. I also added 2 Tbsp of flaxseed.  My muffins were not dry. They were moist but I did change up the recipe. I also used tapioca for the arrowroot because that is what I had. My recipe was quite different but this recipe did give me the idea of what to do with my teff flour and my results where good with my additions so I only gave the recipe 3 stars.

I did change the recipe based on previous reviews and my own taste. I added 1 tsp xanthan gum, I think this is important for gluten free flour. Sub 1/3 cup soy milk for 1/3 cup water. Added 1/3 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup stevia. Sub frozen cranberries for apricots which adds moisture. Also added 2 tbsp flax meal. Baked at 375F for 20 or so min. Just enough sweetness and not dry but check often after 15 min.
