I used mild italian sausage, bulk from the butcher and added red pepper flakes to the soup to our liking. I formed the italian sausage into meatballs and cooked them per the recipe.  Changed nothing else. WONDERFUL! We love cilantro and thought this was GREAT! Served it with a cheesy foccacia bread!

A hearty, tasty soup. Served with garlic bread and fresh fruit, and my husband loved it. A minor change from the recipe, I used two cans of beans and one cup of cilantro (two bunches). This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We loved this soup and have renamed it Mexican Minestrone.  Based on what was in the house, we substituted consume, Rotel tomatoes, barley and garbanzos for the beef broth, stewed tomatoes, hominy and Great Northern beans respectively.  I was unsure about the amount of cilantro the first time that I made the recipe, but found that it was a it was a great addition and very refreshing.  Have made it quite a few times.  Always great!

Excellent soup!  Added some vegetables that my husband will eat like green beans and corn, and used regular Italian sausage not the hot.  I have made this soup many times and will continue to do so.

Very yummy. I used different beans and chick peas instead of hominy (didn't have any) but I'm sure it didn't make a bit of difference. We loved it. I used one pound of sausage instead of two and I didn't take the casings off of the sausage. Nobody noticed. I will make this again.

As far as I am concerned, cilatro tastes like bar soap. This soup works great with ¼-½ cup of just regular, normal parsley.  A bottle of dark beer makes it even better (in the soup, that is).

Excellent very meaty soup, but you gotta like cilantro.  I cut back a little the first time and will only put about half of what the recipe calls for next time.

Fabulous, hearty fare!  I made a few changes:  No hominy, extra can of Northern beans, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, and a combo of hot and mild italian (turkey) sausage (total weight 1.5 lbs).  (I also needed to add more water while it was simmering to make the soup more brothy.) 
With some warm bread from the oven, this soup makes a wonderful winter meal.

I love cilantro so I was anxious to try this. This is very meaty - next time I'll reduce the Italian sausage to 1 1/2 lbs.  I don't like my dishes too spicy so I used regular (not hot) Italian sausage, but it was still a bit spicy (perhaps from the black pepper - next time I'll cut the amt. of black pepper in half). I reduced the salt by half and was glad I did - any more and I think it would have been a bit salty. Overall a delicious soup. The fresh cilantro is delicious in this!!

This was great tasting and easy to make.  I left out the zucchini and the hominy and substituted chicken broth for beef broth.  I also used canned diced tomoatoes with Italian seasonings.  The reason for the changes was because of what I had on hand.  I will make this again and again since it is so adaptable to what is in the cupboard - and fast!!!

Easy to prepare and pretty good tasting but I did have to add a bunch of seasonings.  Left out the hominy and used two cans of tomatoes. Also, I used one cup of cilantro and one cup of fresh parsley. Next time, I think I would leave out the cilantro. Used frozen sliced carrots and added a bit of white wine to the pot. Also, I used mild Italian sausage and just added some ground cayenne to add some heat.

My coworkers and husband thought this was wonderful. It was too spicy for my 10 year old. I think this will be a good winter time dish.

My kitchen smelled wonderful and my husband loved this soup, said it was the best he ever had.  I have a request to make it for his mom.  I simmered the soup for 1 1/2, and it was still perfect.  Yumm.

This soup is FANTASTIC.  Without beef broth in the cupboard, I used beef bullion (so I didn't add salt).  Used only one pound (didn't have two) hot Italian sausage. I hesitated with two whole cups of cilantro, but threw it all in and it was divine.  I made open faced grilled cheese in the toaster oven on sourdough for an excellent compliment.  PERFECT.

I had to alter the recipe based on what I had on hand.  Left out the beans, used one can of beef broth and one can of chicken broth, added chopped green pepers, no cilantro.  Still came out good.  We used extra hot sausauges and I think that added to the flavor of the soup as well.  Overall came out very tasty!!  Easy to modify based on what you have.

this is wonderful! i've made it several times and its consistently delicious. i sometimes add even more cilantro, but i'm a major cilantro fan, so others may not want to do the same. :) thanks so much for this, my favorite go-to soup in the winter.

This was really, really good. I did not use hominy or beans because I didn't have any. I added 1/4 cup shell pasta while simmering. The cilantro really makes the dish.

My whole family loves this! It is so flavorful and hearty that they don't notice all the vegetables packed in it. I prefer chicken broth over beef and use a spicy ring-style sausage that doesn't require removing the casings. For an extra kick, try using canned tomotoes with chiles or jalepenos. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This soup is now permanently part of my make-soup-onSunday-to-carry-to-work-all week collection.  Fabulous flavor, aroma.  I did not crumble the sausage, saw no need and was able to drain the sliced links sufficiently.  At the last minute, I found I had no carrots...but did not miss them.   The cilantro *makes* this soup (but I know that some folk cannot stand the stuff).

Wonderful winter soup, nice and spicy.  Big hit at a dinner party that we went to.  Only changes I made was to put 1lb ground beef and 1lb spicy sausage, so it wouldn't be so hot. Also my hubby doesn't like cilantro (his only flaw) so I put italian parsley instead, and put it all in a crock pot for 5 hrs on high.

Great soup - though I agree with some other reviewers, way to heavy on the cilantro. I ended up using about half a cup of cilantro with half a cup of parsley, but it was still to overpowering of a flavor.  Next time I'm going to cut the cilantro to 1/4 a cup and see how it tastes.

I also cut up some potato and threw it in.  While the ratio of sausage to vegetable is great/tasty, next time I'm also going to increase the veggies and cut out a pound of the sausage to make it healthier.   Definitely worth a try.

Thanks for the recipe! I absolutely adore this and make it often. At first I found removing the casings tiem-consuming but now it's a piece of cake. So much flavour and perfect for a cold winter's night!

I made this today.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe and most times I usually tweak something about a recipe.  This was a winner as is.  It's delicious and super simple to make...can't ask for more.

I really loved this.  Its meaty and hearty.  Its super easy.  You really have to like cilantro (which I LOVE).  If you don't you could mix it up with parsley, spinach or kale whatever.  I made it as is, but I think it could be pretty versatile.  I will definitely make this again. YUMMY, YUMMY,YUMMY!!!!

Like others I used Chick Peas instead of Hominy. My grocer did not have hot italian sausage so I used 1/2 regular italian and 1/2 Chorizo. I also bought it in bulk so I did not have to mess with the casings.  It was amazing. The spice of the Chorizo was just enough to give it a little kick. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was looking for a recipe to use my abundance of cilantro and happened upon this recipe.  It was much better than I expected. The only change I made was to add a chopped onion and some crushed red pepper.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will be making this again.

Had a chance to make this soup over the weekend and it's fantastic. I used HOT sausage, but you could use mild depending on your taste buds...I made it exactly like the recipe, small exception I did add a little water, maybe a half cup to make it wetter..

Unusual but good.  Made it with homemade Italian sausage formed into itty bitty balls.  The sausage flavor greatly impacts the overall flavor of the soup, of course.

I absolutely love this soup! I added a small jar of roasted poblanos and one juice from a lemon! Definitely make this again! You have to love cilantro in order to like this soup....

Made this soup Just as it stated but added a cup of rice the last 20 min. Adding the rice made it a thicker more filling soup. Overall it was a pretty darn good soup easy to make too. Definitely going to make this soup again, especially on a rainy day. Loved it!!! :)

Tried it and loved it. Though even as a strict meat-a-tarian I would consider cutting the amount of Sausage. Heavy protein meal, but a perfect winter meal. Now I might not be able to get up for a day or so.
