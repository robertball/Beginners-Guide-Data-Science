I have been making cod fish cakes for years. This recipe is almost identical to my mothers recipe.  My family loves them.  I also use the same recipe to make salmon cakes.  Delicious!!!!

These were the BEST codfish cakes that I have had in the U.S.  Whenever I order crabcakes in restaurants, they are always overly breaded --- these are filled with fish and nicely balanced by the potatoes.  
A few improvements to the recipe:  add 1/3 more spice, grate and strain the onion, add chopped cilantro with the parsely.  In addition, I served with fresh lime, onion, cilantro and hot sauce.  Perfection!
                                       Update 12-14-15: Continues to be one of our favorite recipes. My extended family requests them frequently.

This was good and easy to make. Next time I will add a little more seasoning, though-it could stand a little more flavor.

Very good, tradtional portuguese fish cake! I didnt use fish seasoning, just pepper, garlic powder and a dash of red pepper flakes.
I made these last year also, and now everyone looks for them!

These were one of the best things I have ever eaten. Who in the world would have thought. I bought salted cod because I had never seen it before and I like to try new things. I did not use onions but did add 1/2 teaspoon onion powder. I used 1 and 1/3 teaspoon old bay seasoning for the seafood seasoning which gave it a slight seasoned taste. Anything less and you would not be able to taste it (as others have said). I used 1 pound of yellow potatoes. Yukon gold would be the equivalent. I have no idea why people continuously post recipes with potato sizes instead of weight. You definitely have to use fresh parsley chopped course. It adds to the flavor in each bite and goes a long way for presentation. People who are complaining that it was too mushy are making crab cake sized cakes. If you look at the recipe it says make golf ball sized cakes. Your cakes will (and should be) small. They should be about 3/8"-1/2" thick. Make sure you have about 1/16"-1/8" of oil in the pan when you cook these. If your oil evaporates add more. You do not want to skimp on the oil or they won't brown and cook correctly.

Fish cakes are a big thing in Bermuda, recipe above is similar but use 3 lb of fish to a 5 lb bag of potatoes. we let the salt fish soak overnight and in the morning rinse the fish under cold water tap getting a lot of salt off and feeling for bones then bring to boil once and through out water.  Place potatoes in pot with fish and cover with fresh water, boil and it is ready for smashing. A must with our fish cakes is parsley, curry powder to taste and thyme.

Used 3 large potatoes, 1/4 c. dried parsley, 1/2 an onion, and 1 t. of "The Famous Seafood Seasoning Recipe".  Since the mixture was very moist, I might be able to use 1 egg next time.  Good 1st try.  I like the suggestion of using the same process for salmon cakes.  Next time I will try with Old Bay Seasoning.

This recipe is awesome!  First time I've used salt cod, but it won't be the last!  I did double the seasoning and after tasting the mash decided to add a little salt.  I soaked the cod for 24 hrs, changing the water several times.  The cakes are bound with potato and egg, not flour or crumbs which made it glutton free.  Rather than a lite coating of flour for frying, I used white rice flour.  The little cakes were delightfully crispy.  We'll be making this often.

I loved this, very much like my mothers, I added celery, basil paste and dill paste for some added flavor.  It was great.  I will keep this in my box for future dinners.

Very tasty, and good for those who don't trust the local fresh fish.  Do use fresh parsley and half again as much Old Bay or other seasoning. Yes the dough is a bit sticky - it's reinforced mashed potatoes!  Use plenty of flour in shaping and flattening patties, and do use enough good frying oil to brown them in a teflon pan.

Very tasty. I skipped the “roll in flour” step though. I refrigerated the formed cakes for an hour before frying, and they held together just fine.  Used the traditional Portugese 2-spoon-forming technique, rather than golfball method. Had plenty left over uncooked that I froze for another day.   I did grate the onion as another suggested, draining the juice before adding to the mix.

I will make again.  The cakes tasted just like the ones I had in Meat Cove Nova Scotia.  Use a large pot to prevent boil overs.

Yum!  I added just over a half of a garlic bulb to ward off the mosquitos and omitted the fish spice as I didn't have any.  It's quite the messy recipe, but it was really really good.  Served it with carrots with garlic butter.

I used celery leaf in place if the parsley. Don't add flour to the recipe it will make it too stiff. Make sure you cook the fish long enough. Next time I will cook potatoes and fish separate.

I wasn't going to change anything but was a tad short on the salt cod so I added a very well drained 5 oz. Tin of salmon. It was delicious.  A keeper.

With the exception of leaving out the seafood seasoning I made these as written, I wanted an East Coast cod cake. I started out making the size specified as a test cake but found that the small size doesn't cook long enough for the onion to soften. I then made them about three sizes larger and they were just as I remembered. Thanks for sharing.
