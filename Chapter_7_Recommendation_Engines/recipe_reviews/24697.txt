If you are trying to duplicate Callard & Bowser - this is it exactly!  However, after scorching the pan the first time, I had to stir continuously and it took an hour over medium heat to reach the right temp, so be careful with that.

This is my husbands all time favorite candy ever!!! The licorice flavoring is
very subtle - even those who dislike licorice will love this candy.  You can also
subsitite the anise flavoring with vanilla if desired.

It is so easy - mix all together, bring to temperature, and then pour in pan to cool - 
by morning they are ready to be cut into perfect squares and wrapped in wax
paper.  They keep their shape at room temperature.

I cannot say enough good about this recipe!!!!  One suggestion I  have for a
twist is this:  after pouring the caramel into a pan to cool, place Lorna Doone 
shortbread cookies all over the to - covering all the caramel.  next day, cut
the caramel into perfect squares around each cookie.  Then, dip the candy into
melted chocolate - let firm and then you have a homemade twix bar - but better!

Without a doubt this is the very best recipe for licorice.  It is soft, chewy and if you use very good anise it is beyond descripton.  I use Watkins Anise for best results.

I have noticed that the people that have given this recipe lower stars have had some difficulty with the recipe.  The main problem that you are having is your heat.  After melting your butter and adding the next ingredients, you have to crank the heat up.  Sugar has to cook on high heat or it will burn before it melts.  Sugar doesn't melt until it hits 225 F (sea-level) so it's going to burn on a low temp before it ever melts.  The other thing is once it starts to boil, as tempting as it is, don't stir. (Just like the recipe says)  Sugar is hard to work with, so don't give up if you fail a couple of times!  I am a culinary student currently in an advanced baking class.

these are scrumptious!  so buttery good and rich and creamy but with a hint of licorice taste.  Didn't have the paste for coloring so tinted w/red food coloring for the holidays.  I heated to 250degrees and they were perfect; not too soft, but nice and chewy without being tacky and sticking to the teeth.  I didn't have a high quality extract(used McCormick's) and had it in the cupboard for a couple of years, so I had to use about 2 1/2 tsp of extract so adjust accordingly.  Lined the pan w/parchment paper.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use a 9x13 pan, as I had to do more cutting of them to get them the desired size.  I didn't refrigerate; just let them sit at room temp for a few hours.  They are much easier to cut than when they are hard from the fridge.  thanks for this wonderful recipe that is a great addition to my holiday trays.

I have never made candy or caramels, so I was nervous to make these, but they turned out so well!!! I can't believe how much they charge for each one of these in the stores when you can make a whole pan this easy!! I don't even like black licorice normally, but my mom made these first and made me try them. I was in love! The 1 tsp extract is mild enough that even if you don't prefer black licorice, you will probably like these. If you want the flavor stronger, add more extract. The last time that I made them, I made it with 1 Tbs, and I thought it was perfect! One of my co-workers husbands loves black licorice, so I made him some, and my co-worker said he liked them so much, he all but wanted to propose to me!!! LOL- he is old enough to be my dad. I have never met someone who has tried these that does not like these. Just watch the thermometer closely- it is critical you take it off the heat exactly when it says to. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!!!

As noted in the recipe, I didn't stir the ingredients and they burned (at a low temp).  This was and expensive lesson.  The second time, I stirred the entire time and the result was wonderful caramels; though I would recommend using more anise extract than 1 tsp. as the flavor is very mild.

Pretty good licorice - says the woman who doesn't like licorice.  So it must be good.  Made my batch exactly as the recipe states, however, I would not recommend pouring into baking dish lined with buttered foil.  Not unless you enjoy picking bits of foil out of your candy.  Otherwise, this was great... I mean, really good.  DH loves it.

These caramels are really delicoius but they didn't taste very licoricey. I had to use anise oil because I couldn't find anise extract. They were also kinda hard to make if you don't have a candy thermometer. Overall pretty good. *UPDATE*
I made these again for book club, in a microwave and dipped apples in it while it was still warm. Then drizzled them in chocolate and added pecans. As my friend said, "If you could fall in love with food this would be my soulmate."

I tried this for the first time after reading quite a few reviews. Here is what I did and some suggestions. I did not use foil, I sprayed the pan with "Pam" butter spray. When it was cool I just flipped it over onto a cutting board and it came out in one piece. I used a pizza cutter with "Pam" butter version on it in order to cut it. I first tried the teaspoon and thought it did not have enough licorice taste so I used a Tablespoon on the next batch. That was much better, but even though I used Watkins brand anise extract, I am going to do another batch using Anise oil, hoping that will have the "staying power" I am looking for. What I find with the extract is that the first few moments in your mouth it is exactly as I remember "Callard and Bowser", but then loses some of the flavor and tastes like a caramel. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who was a fan of the old licorice from C&B. It is very easy. I never use a thermometer, I get it to a boiling stage then set a timer for 6 minutes, and I stir constantly. After 6 minutes of boiling I take it off the heat and add the anise and coloring. Hope this helps!!

This has got to be the best caramel I've ever had! I don't even like black licorice & this is delicious. The anise flavor isn't overwhelming & you can customize to suit your preference. I colored mine red for the holidays and am giving this as a gift to my grandmother who loves black licorice. They're simple to wrap in wax paper & look like professional candies!

This was my first time making a caramel or candy, and I was surprised at how easy it was.  Like others suggested, I upped the anise to 1 tablespoon and stirred continuously.  However, the end result was very hard candies, so I may have to try adding some cream to the next batch.

This is DELICIOUS!  I *just* made it for the first time, and it was SO EASY!  Since there's corn syrup in it as a stabilizer, you *can* stir the entire time it's bubbling and being brought to temperature -- I did, and it's as silky and smooth as it should be; the corn syrup prevents it from crystalizing and being gritty.  Also, I added 1 Tbs. of McCormick Anise extract and still would have liked more (I like it strong).  I poured it out into a parchment-lined 10X15 rectangular glass baking dish but should probably have gone with a 9 X13, as it's pretty thin.  I think I would have preferred also for it to be less firm, but that's just personal preference; the recipe, as is, is PERFECT - exactly the right consistency for caramels!  I will make this recipe again and again, and I'm even thinking about using different flavorings just to change it up from time to time.  Thank you for sharing this super-easy, super-yummy recipe!  LOVE IT!  Five stars!  :D

I love this recipe! I accidentally cooked my first batch too long and was going to throw it out but instead I broke it up and gave it as "coal" to select friends at Christmas. Even that was a hit.

Tasty.  I just made this recipe in the microwave.  I just cooked for a minute at a time, over and over, until it hit the "firm ball" stage, which I think I hit pretty well.

Here's what I'll do differently next time:

1.  Make only half the recipe - unless I'm planning on giving most of it away.  It make a LOT!

2.  Use more black paste food coloring.  I used about 1/4 teaspoon, and it made it a dark brown.

3.  Use even more anise flavoring.  I doubled it (I put in 1/2 teaspoon of anise oil, which is the equivalent of 2 teaspoons anise extract) but I think adding even more would be better.

I skipped the aluminum foil based on recommendations, and didn't need it at all.

This recipe is amazing.  Everyone loves it, even those who dislike licorice.  Make sure you use black paste coloring, the black liquid from grocery store makes it brownish.

these turned out perfectly - the anise flavor is subtle.  I don't think it's necessary to use black food coloring, though I special ordered it...it psychologically adds to the presentation because the black matches the anise flavor!  The most labor-intense part of the recipe is definitely cutting and wrapping the individual pieces - it makes a way bigger batch than you'd think in that 9x9 pan!

FABULOUS RECIPE!! Thank you sooo much. I was looking to duplicate the licorice caramels my grandmother used to get from Fannie May, and with a full ounce of anise extract, I nailed it! Also, I put a little in a dish before adding the anise and black coloring, and the caramel is DELISH! Making a batch of those now. :)

Two words: Oh yeah! Fabulous. I reduced the recipe to 32 servings for my first attempt, added another fat tsp of anise extract, and followed directions. Stirred the entire way through to protect from burning and ...wow. I thank you so much. I tried Walkers in England and you know? These are so much nicer as the are home made.  Kudos!

One of my favorite candy recipes; even my friends who hate licorice love these. They're buttery and delicious, with a subtle anise flavor. 

They are, however, prone to scorching even in a heavy-bottomed pan, so be careful to continue stirring while you heat them! If you happen to scorch them anyway, the burnt bits can be removed by pouring the hot caramel through a sieve into the prepared pan. (I prefer to use a plain buttered pan with no foil; I found it was hard to get all the foil away from the cooled caramel without it ripping.)

Mine turned out quite hard but softened in the mouth.  Cooked it until 120 C.  I used Sambvca liquor for flavoring (1 Tbsp) (I would use more next time or combine it with anise extract for a more pronounced flavor);  I did not have anise extract on hand. Will make again but cook to a lower setting for a softer candy.  I used buttered parchment paper in my 9 x 13 inch pan.  Had no problems with sticking to candy.  Wish my grandmother was here to enjoy these since she was the one who turned us on to Callard and Bowser when I was a child.

If you like a strong licorice flavor use more extract. I used 1 tbsp and it still wasn't as strong as I'd have liked. It does have a very good after taste though. I know the instructions say to not stir, but I LOVE making caramels and have always stirred mine most of the cook time. Also I highly recommend using a wooden spoon. All in all it's a very good recipe.

Great recipe, but I like more licorice flavor.  I substituted 1/2 oz. anise oil.  Wow!  Nothing better! I also need to stir mine constantly.

I love licorice and have been looking for a long time for a good recipe. If fact, it has been hard to even find a recipe. This one is awesome. I increased anise to 1 Tbsp because I like a stonger flavor. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe.

I have made this 3 times, each time I had an issue with the sugar. Today when I made it I finally got the right consistency because I kept stirring until it was the right temperature. I added 2 TABLESPOONS of anise, one was a better brand and one was a cheaper brand, the only other change I made was the brand of sweetened condensed milk. There was actually less licorice flavor than before...could the milk make the difference? I don’t understand what else could have cause it.

I made this for my Mom; she loves this stuff and so do all of us (her kids) ... but what the heck happened; as I started heating the ingredients together these brown scorched bits were coming up (and I was doing it nice n mellow in a le creuset #20 enameled cast iron, gently and then once melted turned up higher) and getting worse and worse.  Thankfully after the thermometer hit 243 I took it off the heat, whisked it together and the black paste covered up all the wrong that was in there.  I've made a LOT of caramel, toffee and other kinds of hot bubbly soft-ball candy in these pots but never with so much corn syrup (why would that have made it scorch?) or maybe the can of milk (?) although the finished product is fantastic (and I did 3x the anise, the good Watkins kind) I hate to think I covered up a dirty little secret with black food coloring !!!

Just as good as Callard & Bowser yet better because it was softer and did not get too stuck in the teeth. Only problem was it stuck to the aluminum foil and the candy wrappers.  I then used parchment paper and it worked.  I will use parchment paper instead of the aluminum foil.

Tried these tonight and they did not turn out. I didn't stir after they came to a boil and the bottom of the pan scorched. I have very heavy bottomed cookware but as one reviewer stated if you don't stir it constantly it will scorch. I am trying another one now and hope for better luck. Did have good flavor though.

I wanted a strong black licorice flavour so I went with the 1 tbsp of extract and ended up eyeballing another good dollop of extract to get what I wanted and I still could have added more.  Very good candy recipe however for caramels.  The only puzzling thing was the direction that said "without stirring".  On medium heat, I got little dark chunks that almost looked like it was scorching but upon tasting, it wasn't burned.  I couldn't stand there and not stir so I stirred until I got to the correct temperature.   Very tasty and the recipe makes tons.  Thanks!

These are the best caramels. All that needs to be said has been already said in previous reviews. However, I am having a scorching problem. I have a gas semi professional range and my btu's are very high. I cooked the caramels on low and it was too hot. I turned them down to simmer and it seemed like after getting to about 238 degrees or so, the thermometer didn't move. I have tried turning down the heat in the middle of cooking, but that makes the butter separate. I have tried stirring occasionally, but it seems that from 240 to 248 is where they start to burn. If any one knows the answer, I need help on this. Also, I am interested in the suggestion of using the microwave...how long etc. And one more thing, can I use caphalon or something like it for boiling caramel? Help.

Jeepers! I can't do anything right! I burnt the pan the first time upon making it and the second time I forgot to add the corn syrup! I bet it would have tasted wonderful if I wasn't such a klutz!

This is as close as one can get to the original Callard and Bowsers. I've tweeked the amount of butter using a little less with good results, I generally make 2 double batches around the holidays, to share with family and friends. I give the majority way to prevent myself from devouring it all myself. The black paste food coloring had been difficult to find, but I've done it with the off the shelf liquid type (just dump in some of every color) the color presentation of the original black/green does add to the mystique. My grandchildren are new fans and I send some to my 83 year old father as he introduced me to it as a child. Still don't know why they stopped making it, I'd chose it over Altoids any day of the week

I made these for Christmas and they were fantastic!  I gave them to my Dad as a gift as he's a black licorice lover and he loved them!  I did add extra licorice flavoring as some other reviewers suggested and it was good but if you like licorice flavor I would suggest almost triple the extract!  Overall a great caramel with a smooth texture and holds it's shape well in order to cut and roll in wax paper.

First time making this recipe. Absolutely perfect and very reminiscent of the old Callard and Bowser Licorice Toffee. Instead of extract, I used 1 teaspoon anise oil.  You can find it on-line.  All you need is a 1 dram bottle which is equal to 1 teaspoon oil. If using extract, I would use more than the 1 teaspoon called for. This is a wonderful recipe which will become part of my regular Christmas treat offerings!
