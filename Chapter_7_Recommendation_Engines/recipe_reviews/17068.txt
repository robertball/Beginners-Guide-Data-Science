Mine was DELICIOUS.  But I must say that I did make quite a few changes....  6 slices of bread instead of 4, 1/4 cup applesauce plus 1 tablespoon smart balance light instead of butter, added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 tsp. cinnamon. Omitted raisins and added 1/2 cup walnuts.  While the bread and oats were soaking, I mixed together everything but the bananas.  I mashed up one of the 4 bananas and added it to the cinnamon mixture and let it soak in the fridge while the bread/oats were doing their thing for about 1 1/2 hours.  Baked for 55 minutes and came out perfect!  (see my photo!)  I recommend 'chopping' the bananas instead of slicing so that you get more of them distributed throughout the dish and you get a little in every bite.  This was great for dessert but even better for breakfast.  I think rum or rum extract would really make this yummy.

Pretty tasty - I used white bread instead of whole wheat, light margarine instead of butter, and nonfat milk instead of lowfat, and I don't think it made a difference.  I did use raisins.  This is a good way to use leftover bananas, oats, the heels of bread loaves.  The only addition I would make is a pinch or two of cinnamon - without it, this recipe was a little bland.

My husband loves it! And it smells wonderful. I did add 2 eggs as other people have suggested, the pudding seems to hold better. I served it with vanilla ice cream. It's a hit!!!

I used some suggestions given:  I added cinnamon and vanilla extract and walnuts.  Also, I used applesauce instead of butter, and soy milk instead of regular milk (to lower fat and cholesterol).  I cut down the bananas to 2, and used the Splenda/brown sugar mixture to cut sugar calories.  I added currants as well as Heath toffee chips to sweeten it up, because I was making it for a dessert.  I served with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled caramel sauce on it.  It would not have been sweet enough for a dessert otherwise.  I rated the recipe as a 4 by itself, but with all my changes/additions, it was a 5!  I got rave reviews and everyone wanted more.

This has now become a staple dessert in my home.  I use soy milk, substituted sucanat for the sugar, use only one banana and added a sprinkling of chocolate chips to the top.  My family LOVES this, and it's so EASY!

Wonderful!  Only had 2 bananas and used nonfat powdered milk.  Replaced the oil with applesauce and it came out great!  Will definitely make it again.

My husband and I have been looking for ways to incorporate more whole grains and fruits into our dite.  This one is a keeper - with no eggs or flour and little sugar, it is a moist, healthy and tasty way to get your oats and fruits.  I did add cinnamon, vanilla and twice the raisins.  My husband rated it a 10! Next time I will try canola oil instead of the margarine.

OK, but next time I'll mash the bananas as the slices were a rather odd texture.  I also added cinnamon and 2 eggs.

I have been making this for a few years now.  I use an egg, applesauce instead of the butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup of raisins, 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla, 5 slices of bread, and usually only 2 chopped bananas.  So, yes, I make some changes.  :)  But anyway, it's wonderful and obviously very easy to tailor to your liking.  We had it last night for dessert while warm (the kiddos put a little choc. chip ice cream on top, and I drizzled it with a little Hershey's syrup), and I just had some cold.  It's a great and easy way to have just a little something sweet and use up the stale bread ends and over-ripe bananas you have in the house!

This was fun to make, but I did not think that this was anything special.  My 8 & 5 year old did not like it.  It ended up being a total waste.

So yummy and healthy!! :) I wanted to give it five stars but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 2 eggs, some vanilla, cinnamon, and I replaced the brown sugar with honey. The milk wasn't at all low-fat; it was fresh from our Jersey cow, and the bread was homemade. Truely a healthy breakfast that is perfect for a dieter!

I love this recipe. The first time I made it as directed, without raisins and loved it. Yesterday I made it again, adding 1tbsp of cinnamon and 1/2tbsp vanilla. I used 3 apples, diced, instead of bananas and it came out tasting like apple pie. I'll be making this again and again with the leftover bread!

This turned out alright... but not great. I substituted applesauce for the butter, other than that I followed the recipe. I thought it was a little more like oatmeal than a bread pudding.

This recipe was an awesome starter recipe (hence the 4 stars).  I listened to a lot of the reviews and added vanilla, cinnamon AND some coconut rum that REALLY made the recipe just right.  Plus i used 6 pieces of wheat bread and applesauce instead of butter. I will definitely make again.

This is just OK, sort of bland, but I guess thats what bread-puddings are.  It was a way to use up extra bananas. It does not keep well tho, so try to consume it in one day if you can.

I made this recipe to get rid of some over ripe bananas only to find out i had run out of white bread so I used 4 slices of rye bread. The rye bread added extra flavor and texture. Overall, it ended up great. i'll definately make this again! (:

EXCELLENT!  I had bananas and bread on hand to use up, so made this recipe.  Based on other reviews I did add about 1/2 teas of vanilla, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was VERY good.  Not overly sweet, which is good in my opinion, but great banana flavor.  I had some for dessert tonight, but I may have more for breakfast tomorrow! THANKS for the recipe.

This recipe was good.  I did make several changes as recommended by others.  I used applesauce instead of butter. I soaked the bread, oatmeal one mashed bananna, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnimon in frig. for at least one hour. I also chopped banannas instead of slicing them.  I also sprinkled on 2 tsp. sugar on top before putting in oven.
much better.

Great recipe!  With the original recipe everyone loved it as it was not too sweet.  I have made it several times now and have added different ingredients at times.  I have used old raisin bread and danish pastries as well.  On occasion I've also omitted the banana's and used a can of comstock apple pie filling.  Like others I have also used cinnamon, 1 cup of brown sugar, 2 eggs & even used vanilla soymilk.  Yummylicious!  I have a co-worker's grandson who just loves this banana oat bread pudding that he will not share it with anyone in his family.  LoL!

Absolutely loved it!  Very hearty!  I am not a bread pudding fam at all, but hubby is ~ I loved it!  I loved the texture with the bananas.  I sliced the bananas and added egg to additional milk and poured over as a couple of other reviewers suggested and omitted the raisins (just didn't have on hand).  Will definately have again and again.  A perfect filling meal for breakfast.

it's ok; i was trying to get rid of the bananas that i had, and i found this recipe. i'd add extra sugar next time, and mash the bananas up before mixing them into the oats and milk.

i'd definitely try it again.

A good way to use up stale wheat French bread and some very ripe bananas. I am not fond of raisins baked into things so I used blueberries... SO GOOD!!

This recipe is great.  It is not too sweet - it would be good for a diabetic or dieter.  I also made this recipe at my cottage on a whim and I didn't have the recipe.  I ended up using slightly stale coffee cake, really ripe bananas, oats, milk and a few eggs (I couldn't remember if there were eggs in it).  It turned out fabulous and everyone was glad to have a nice warm breakfast after drinking.

I added 2 eggs to make the texture more solid! Otherwise, I just followed the recipe. Didn't add the raisins or anything else! It tasted light & delicious after refrigerated!! GOOD & HEALTHY DESSERT!

I added in a bit of all the reviewer's suggested extras- cinnamon, vanilla, choc. chips, nutmeg, pumpkin spice, allspice. It smelled great in the oven and tasted pretty good but would have been very bland without the help. It's consistency reminds me of soggy banana bread overall. Might be good for breakfast.

I thought it was pretty good - I took the advice of adding a bit more sugar, cinnamon & vanilla extract.  I'm not sure why this recipe does not call for eggs.  I think eggs would have made it thicker, more custard-like.  Still, I ate it all.  ;)

simple to make and delicious as a lighter alternative to the richer relatives of this dessert pudding.

We also found this pretty bland. I added extra brown sugar and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top but it still needed something.  Even served with caramel topping....it was still missing something.

This was delicious! My bananas were quite ripe, so I just put in slices and they fit right in with the rest of the texture when the pudding was done. I did add 1 T of cinnamon and 1 t of ginger, just because I like those flavors. 

 I made a warm syrup with: 1/2 C maple syrup, 2 oz bourbon, 2T brown sugar, 1/4C butter and 1T cornstarch stirred over a low flame until it started to bubble around the edges. 

We served the pudding warm with a dollop of vanilla ice cream and some syrup. A special occasion dessert we will serve again!

This recipe was exactly what I needed. I had 12 ripened bananas and no flour.  so I had to make the necessary adjustments. I did add an egg as previously suggested, used white bread didn't have wheat, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg and pecans. It took 2.5 hours to cook and was still a little mussy (first time baking something that wasn't prepackaged).  It was actually really good and tasty. 4 stars. I would give it five but the mushy texture. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be that way.

Added a few dashes of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla extract. Used 5 slices of wheat bread. I thought it was too soft (I guess I like a more textured bread pudding) but the oatmeal made a nice crusty feeling on top. I made a pinot noir reduction to drizzle it on top. Still yummy, and a whole lot healthier!

The reason I gave this a four is because I added stuff like everyone suggested and think it would've been rather bland without it. I added extra brown sugar cause I wanted it to be sweet for a dessert. Used cinnamon, 2 eggs, vanilla, and greek yogurt instead of butter. I mashed one banana and mixed it with the butter and oat mixture and then diced the other three. Served ice cream over it (which I know kind of defeats any hope of it being healthy, but it could be worse). Turned out really nice!

This turned out quite well.  I did add two eggs as was suggested in other reviews and 1 tsp. & vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I'm not a big fan of banana pudding but am tired of throwing away over ripened bananas and thought I'd give this a try.  I'm so glad I did.  This is delicious.  If you like bread pudding and oatmeal you'll love this.

Trying to curb my curving for bread pudding with something a little healthier, I found this recipe. The thing with this recipe is, you have to like the individual components: I adore oats, ww bread, bananas, and milk...thought it sounded perfect. This is great breakfast food. My family thought I had just made the strangest dessert ever; it wasn't sweet or rich enough for them and thought it was way too healthy with bananas and oats. I omtitted the butter and instead mashed one banana and stirred it in with the sugar and raisins. One banana mashed in gave HUGE banana flavor. I added one ts each of cinnamon and vanilla...Oh, def use a lot of raisins...about a cup. I sliced another banana and arranged it over the top. Next time I would slice another one to put on the top...the baked banana flavor was awesome. I also crushed gingersnap crackers over the top...they melted and hardened into a nicy, spiced crust. I think I would add 2 eggs next time...I missed the custard flavor but it's still great like this. I had to use 3 c of milk b/c I was trying to use it up and tha made it a little too mushy...should have added another slice of bread or more oats. I would love to try this with all oats...a oat pudding. Or dark chocolate chips;]I like it both warm and cold and with a big sccop of vanilla yogurt on top, more sliced bananas( hey, I'm not kidding when I say I LOVE bananas. Still, I think 4 bananas in this would have been a little too much even for me.) and a cold glass of milk. P

I used oil instead of butter and chocolate chips instead of raisons. Made half the recipe in a loaf pan. My husband loved it because not too sweet. Very easy to prepare while making dinner. Could dress it up for company with a little maple syrup and whipped cream on top. Not heavy like most bread pudding. Was nervous about not using eggs but worked great.

I enjoyed this one, it was tasty.  I felt like it still needed a little something to make it a 5 star.  Next time I think I might try to add a little bit of rum extract or some cinnamon.

I really loved this, but must admit I didn't really follow the directions precisely.  I did add cinnamon and vanilla following the advice of previous reviewers. I also cheated and used  banana and cream instant oatmeal.  More bread, cause I had a lot, and loads of raisins.  Thanks for the great idea!

I, unfortunately, did not care for this at all. The banana was overpowering and it wasn't sweet enough at all. Another reviewer suggested adding a little vanilla but I didn't do that. Maybe it would have helped. But I followed the directions as written and this was horrible. My husband wouldnt even try a bite and I wish I hadn't. Sorry, but I would not recommend this to anyone.

As so many I made changes.  I used Brioche rolls that I had left over, I also added an egg, 1 cup unsweetened coconut 1/3 cp of score pieces.  I only had 2 bananas so I mashed them before I added them I also decided to bake it in muffin tins.  It was delicious, I will definitely be making this again.

I made it for my hubby for breakfast. I made it as healthy as I possibly could. I used a Granny Smith Apple, two ripe bananas and 1/3 cup of Golden raisins. Instead of brown sugar I used Local Honey (as everyone should as it will help your body grow an immunity to the allergens in your surroundings. Since bees are the workers that bring us this sweet medicine)(a tsp of your local honey per day will have you breathing easier by next summer). I also added one tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla extract and one egg.  Btw, he absolutely loves it! He’s been back for two refills as I’ve been writing this review! Lol! I believe I will be making this again. Lol! Thanks so much for sharing

Added one apple sliced and diced tossed with about 1 tbsp maple syrup, 1 tsp cinnamon powder, 2 tsp vanilla essence/extract, used melted coconut oil instead, almond milk instead, 2 flaxseed egg substitute (or just 2 tablespoons of flaxseed meal in milk mixture while setting aside, and added about 3/4 cup of dark sweet cherries cut in halves. I let it bake a little longer until the moisture was dried, or the pudding came together ( about 15 min more).  I was skeptical about this recipe, but I was pleased with it, because it tasted really good, and my family loved it. Had to take a picture before it all disappeared. This is one of my best puddings. I will be making more.

Super yummy, the only thing I would change is either add less milk or bake for longer (it came out a bit too wet for my tastes.) I would also add walnuts for more texture.

This was very good. I did make changes after reading some reviews.  I used 5 slices of bread, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, one egg, applesauce instead of butter, no raisins & I only had 3 bananas. And I cut the bananas in cubes instead of slices.  I felt the texture was  a little too mushy.  So next time I will use at least 6 slices of bread.

So good, I used a fancy cinnamon brown sugar bread and 3 bananas instead of 4. I didn't let it soak and I uses one egg and raisins I plumped in hot water. Mine turned out great! You could serve it to company if you use great bread (probably not wheat) I also topped it with fresh whipped cream..YUM..Thanks for sharing..
