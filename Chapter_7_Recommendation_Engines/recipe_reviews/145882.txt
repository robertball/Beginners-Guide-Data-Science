Any lover of eggplant would find this an excellent dish. I was in a hurry - did not seed the tomatoes and used sliced almonds.  Still good!

I think this recipe is just ok, considering the amount of work and time that goes into it.

First, I cheated.  I didn't seed the tomatoes or remove the skin from the almonds.  It was still very good and my boys actually liked it.  I gave this 4 stars only because I had to add more spice.  As written, it seemed a little blah.  This will go in the rotation.  Thank you!!

This was a good recipe you may have to add some more flavor to it but it came out good. I used almonds slivers and it was good next time I will try the smoke almonds and see how it taste.

Very delicious vegan/vegetarian dish. I used blanched whole almonds and it was easier than peeling almonds, I thought. I have had this twice now and I probably will be eating it for years to come.

Wonderful recipe.  I made as is, but with 1 Tbs of sugar instead of 2.

By the time I finished the cooking after adding the tomatoes, etc., the egg plant went mushy. We probably just don't like egg plant well enough to make it work for us.

Very good recipe but it probably needs more flavor.  I made a half recipe but used the full amount of mint, garlic, and chili powder and it came out very well.  I didn't seed the tomatoes and still had to add a dash of white wine to keep ingredients from over browning.  I also used asian eggplants which don't have be peeled or salted, which cut down on the work involved.

I used chopped almonds.  It was quite good and not at all watery even though I didn't seed the tomatoes.  The dish has a great appearance.

I made this recipe because I am looking for a way to get my family to eat eggplant.  I am also not a fan of the vegetable but I liked this recipe.  The only change I made was to use plum tomatoes because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't notice the chilli powder in the dish, so if I made it again I would increase it slightly because we like a little heat.  Sadly, while my family ate the eggplant they are not converts, saying "we could eat this once a year".

Very good dish!  I added a few peppers and a can of water chestnuts. The water chestnuts and almonds gave it a nice texture.  I also spiced it up a bit with a dash of red pepper flakes.  My husband loved it and I was pleasantly surprised.  Definitely keeping this on my list for a meatless dinner and nice alternative to breading and frying eggplant.

Great vegetarian dish that's not too overpowering in taste. I didn't seed the tomatoes, and also used toasted silver Almonds - yum.

I used slivered almonds and was too lazy to seed the tomatoes. It looks and smells great! Excellent flavor.

This was really good. I wasn't sure I'd like it at first, but it's very tasty! I didn't have fresh mint, so I added dried when I added the eggplant. I also used slivered almods because they were much easier to find. The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I think it needs a little extra acid. Next time I'll probably add a little more white wine or possibly a squeeze of lemon juice. Overall, very nice dish. I plan on making it when my vegetarian sister comes to visit!

Can substitute squash and zucchini instead of egg plant.  Skip the salt and soak.
