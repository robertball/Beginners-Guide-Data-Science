I thought this pie had a really good flavor.  Unfortunately, it didn't firm up in the oven.  It was golden brown and I was afraid if I cooked it any longer I'd burn it, so I pulled it out and we just ate it kind of soupy the first night.  The leftovers firmed up in the fridge, though, and it was a great lunch the next two days.
