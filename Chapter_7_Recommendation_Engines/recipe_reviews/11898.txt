Wow, this is great and very unique!  For all you Trader Joes fans, I did this recipe with TJs whole-wheat penne, 1 lb. green beans halved instead of snow peas, and TJs Shitake Seasame Salad dressing.  In order to spice it up a bit I added a little crushed red pepper and based on previous reviews I added a tablespoon of soy sauce.  (FYI, dont skip the ginger and garlic, they really make a difference) Everyone here loved it!  I will definitely make it again. Thanks

Paired this with the Soy-Sesame Dressing also at Allrecipes.  The two complimented each other perfectly.

I used brown rice (1 c. uncooked) in place of the pasta and added some chicken from the deli and served as a main course.  Both my husband and I loved it!  Will be making this again.  Great way to use up some summer veggies from the farmer's market.

I multipied this recipe for 32 servings.  I only used 1/2 the amount of pasta recommended.  I cooked the garlic and ginger in the sesame oil, then added my Asian-style salad dressing.  My dressing was sesame-oil based.  The dressing had no soy sauce, so I added quite a bit (then found I didn't need to add salt).  Wow!  Everyone liked it very much.  I had so much left-over (although there were 35 people at the party, there were 6 salads)... a guest needed to leave early, as she was going to her brother's birthday party the same day.  She asked if she could take the remainder of the pasta salad to share with them.  SUCH a great banquet or potluck food.  There is no meat or eggs to spoil!

I think this salad has potential but I used a light Wishbone Asian Dressing and it came out too bland. It was better after I added some soy sauce. I would recommend increasing the vegetables in this recipe. Seemed like a lot of pasta. Black sesame seeds gave the salad a great contrast. I added green onion instead of red onion. Some left-over shredded chicken would be great to add to make this a complete meal.

This was very good.  I lightened it up by using fat free asian dressing and whole wheat pasta.  I am glad I read the reviews first and used soy sauce.  The sesame oil really makes a difference and intensifies the flavor.  I plan on using baby corn in it next time.

The Asian Pasta Salad was okay. If I were to make it again, I would triple the vegetables. The Pasta/Vegetable ratio was way too heavy on the pasta side, it just didn't have a lot of flavor. I would probably increase the amount of dressing as well. In general, I found it on the bland side.

This recipe was unique and tasty. I used whole-wheat rotini for the pasta and Light Asian Sesame dressing (Kraft). I also ended up using a stir fry mix that included broccoli, red peppers, onions, etc., and added some of my own green onion. Additionally, I added some chili pepper to give it just a little spicy kick (as I prefer my Asian food to be a bit spicy). The sesame seeds are a great touch and look nice!

I found this pasta salad to be a great change of pace.  I left the broccoli raw, to add flavor and crunch.  It is a very simple to do, tasty dish.

Very nice salad and ginger root and fresh garlic are NOT an option and integral to this salad.  Added 2/3 cup of finely julienned carrots but a cup would be better.  As well, I cut up some green onions to sprinkle on the top and added one tbsp. of light soy sauce to mix with the sesame oil to anoint the top.   No salt or pepper needed in my opinion.  :)

Love it. I only used a 1/2 cup of the dressing to save on some sodium. Super simple, fast and delicious!
