These are great cookies. I substituted butter for shortening. I took them to a woman's tea party and they were a hit. Thanks so much for the recipe.

These were a very tasty spice cookie. The only problem I had with this recipe was it was so soft and the cookies spread out too much. I added more flour to my remaining dough and then had success with the shape and texture. I would recommend these for anyone who likes a chewy and spicy cookie. They go very nicely with a cup of tea.

Good. Probably really good with tea. The dough was quite sticky so I stuck it in the fridge for a while. They turned out a little cake-like after I added a little extra flour (2T).

Excellent. Followed other reviewer's suggestion and added 2T of flour to the batter as it did seem pretty moist. We're very good.
