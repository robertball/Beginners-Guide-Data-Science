This was a very nice dish. I don't usually rate a recipe unless I've followed it exact, but the few changes I made didn't change the integrity of dish at all. Instead of the cocktail shrimp I stirfried large shrimp in with the peppers, onions and scallions and instead of the noodles I served everything over rice. My family enjoyed this dish very much. I will surely be making this again.

Both my husband and I LOVED it. I did make a few changes though - skipped the shrimp, added chicken and slivered carrots and mushrooms. I also tripled the sauce but only doubled the rest. DEFINITELY will be in the regular rotation!

This was very tasty. Next time I might add a touch more curry powder but I followed the recipe exactly this time and found it quick and easy.

This was pretty good but didn't seem to have any unique flavor...I followed another reviewers suggestions and doubled the curry and added cayenne pepper. I didn't have the oyster sauce either time but didn't miss it. When sauteing the veggies I also added a little crushed red pepper for more kick! My husband went back for seconds.

Pretty good!  It could have used a bit more ginger and curry, which we will do next time, but we will definitely make again.  Simple and delicious.  You should note that we used deveined and peeled shrimp that was a bit tough, and that might have been the reason I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Next time, we are putting the shrimp in towards the end to see if that helps.  Definitely a keeper though.  Thanks.

I made this for dinner tonight and my hubby kept saying..boy this good! I thought so too and easy to prepare. I had fresh shrimp which I stir-fried first, then followed the recipe except had no oyster sauce so subbed Frank's Hot Sauce in same quantity. Will make this often!

This was very tasty.  I served this for a couple friends and they asked for the recipe so I e-mailed it to them:).  Thank you to those who submitted this.  I served this with french bread and a salad on the side.

I loved the concept of this dish...of course had to make it my own. I used angelhair pasta, doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested...of course I didn't use cooked cocktail shrimp...yuck! Instead raw deviened shrimp.  Added the shrimp and a handful of baby spinach at the last minute.  Also added mushrooms to the veggie saute and for some kick a few squirts of siracha.  The best addition was a can of coconut milk.  Topped with fresh cilantro and me and my kids loved it.  Thanks for the fabulous idea and will make it again soon...probably mix it up...thinking something crunchy, nuts or sprouts as other viewers recommended.  Great concept and am sure it is good as published, but just can't leave a good thing alone!

Good recipe. Added a ton more curry powder and a bit of tumeric. The addition of bean sprouts adds a nice crunch. If you like spice add some fresh red chile, or chile sauce!

DELICIOUS!  100% for flavor,  lost one star for the colour which could be improved if you use more curry.

Quick to make and absolutely delicious!  I have made a few adjustments to this recipe to suit my tastes. First off I make double the sauce and when making the sauce I upped the the curry power to 3 tablespoons (use 1.5 tablespoons if you are not doubling your sauce)and added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (use more or less depending on how hot you like your curry). I also use ramen noodles rather than the rice noodles.

Didn't have all the ingredients, but winged it.  It still turned out good.  Don't like rice noodles so I used udon noodles (Cooked those while making the rest).  Didn't have peas so I sliced up some mushrooms.  Left out the green onion-everyone agreed I shouldn't have. I thought it smelled better than it tasted, but everyone liked it.

Made this tonight.  It was very good.  Did not have the noodles or the peas so I substituted rice and edamame (which we prefer over peas anyway).  Next time I would add more curry.

This is good.  I added cubed firm tofu at the same time as the onions and peppers, and this was a nice addition.  I used less shrimp.  Its taste would depend largely on the quality and strength of your curry powder; I had to add extra to give it enough flavor.  It was also good with a squeeze of lime juice on it.

This is an easy to modify recipe that everyone in my family loves, I don't use the oyster sauce because we don't like the fishy taste, no substitute needed, just leave it out

Not that great - very average.  My family ate it, but didn't have seconds or eat the leftovers, so I threw a lot away.

This was a great recipe!  I usually am leery about trying any recipe on Allrecipes as I think the reviews are over inflated but I'm glad I took a chance on this one.  For years I've been looking for a good curry noodle recipe and I think this one might be it.  You could easily change out the veggies and proteins turning into an original dish.   Highly recommend trying this one....and its easy too!

I didn't have most of the ingredients, but it came out simply great. I had some Thai-style veggies, that I added, and I also added maybe 2 Tablespoons of soy milk, which gave it a nice flavor with the curry...The whole dish came out fantastic... :)

I used less sugar, more curry powder, and threw in some beansprouts. The flavor was excellent, but I've decided once and for all that I don't like rice noodles - the texture is so unpleasant. Next time, I will just use regular angel hair pasta. Thanks!

I followed the recipe to the tee.  I doubled the sauce and made a chicken version for my husband who won't eat seafood and he liked it too.  My 1 year old couldn't get enough.  Definitely a keeper in our house.  
Thank you!  Yum!

Yummy!  I didn't add peas because I didn't have them - but after tasting, I don't think I would like the peas with it.  I used spaghetti noodles and they were fine. My hubby loved this and so did I!

This was really yummy! I didn't have oyster sauce, so I use Worcestershire sauce. I also used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil. I added a jalapeno pepper which added a really good flavor and a small kick.

Absolutely delicious! Made 1.5# shrimp & 1.5# chicken tenderloins, sauteed in butter before simmering it in the sauce (3 recipes) w/lots of curry powder and 2/3c of coconut milk which really made it!  First time making a curry like this and it's gluten free!

This is not my favorite stir fry, but it's not bad.  I think there are too many peas and I think it needs some "zip".  Maybe some chili sauce or some crushed red pepper.  It's also possible the peas wouldn't be so overwhelming without the ginger.  It's just a little sweet for my taste.

I am only giving it 3 stars because I did have to make some changes. After the changes it was delicious! I added 2 x the amount curry powder. And added chili sauce. It was delicious and I will make it again with these changes

I found this recipe to be close to what i wanted, but a little mild. Next time I will increase the curry to 2tsp and maybe add 1/4tsp red pepper flakes. I also did 1/2lb of shrimp and 1/2 chicken breast for some variety

It's OK, but we all agreed it doesn't make it onto our "must have frequently" list.

I ran out of curry and used garam masala to make up for it (and therefore eliminated the sugar).
This was a very unique dish to us, and we quite enjoyed it - I especially loved how easy it was to prepare! We served broccoli on the side (next time I will just add it in with the peas and noodles).

It was amazing, I didn't use peas instead I used a packet of fresh stir fry veg and mushrooms. I also used vermicelli noodles. The flavour was amazing and it was so quick!

Good basic dish. Was hoping for a bit more flavour but that can be adjusted for next time. I used snow peas instead of regular peas, which I think was a great choice, also added mushrooms and scallops. For next time I think increase the amount of curry powder and add a touch of salt. If you don't have peanut oil, any cooking oil will do. Don't waste your money buying it for this recipe.

I loved this!  I saved this recipe to my "to make list" in 2003 and wish I had made it before.  I rated 4 stars because this is a 4 serving dish and sauce needs to be doubled.  I used fresh jumbo shrimp instead of frozen cocktail shrimp and edamame because I didn't have peas.  Making again tonight with scallops.  Yum!!

I give it five stars because our whole family enjoyed very much-my hubby has lived in Japan and visited many countries in Asia and he is very particular about Asian food-  curry in particular and he loved this!  Even our very picky 3 year old loved it!   I only made one change- so I couldn't see taking off an entire star because of that, I doubled the curry.  
Added my own concoction of veggies: bok choy, broccoli and carrots.  Served over jasmine rice.

My wife and I loved it I did make a few additions, I added mushrooms, cut baby corn, bean sprouts, snow peas, and some dry chilli pepper flakes for a bit of kick. Also substituted tiger prawns for the cocktail shrimp.

After a couple substitutions (I hate peas and couldn't find peanut oil) I LOVED it!  I substituted with bean sprouts and coconut oil.  So easy to make and taste delicious ??

Turned out great. Went a little heavy on the curry powder and garlic/ginger. Skipped the noodles and used rice instead. Yum.

WOW.  We had this for dinner tonight.  So good.  I did used 4 cloves of garlic, some extra ginger and curry powder for the extra spice.  So much better than delivery.

This was a solid dish. Changed it up based upon some recommendations: doubled the sauce (next time, will triple it), doubled the curry & ginger, sprinkled cayenne and added a dash of hot sauce to add kick (I like spicy!). Added 8 oz mushrooms, subbed a white onion, added tofu- which was yummy! I'll def make again, and might even consider adding a little chicken as well next time.

I love all the ingredients used in this recipe (except peas), so I expected something better.  It was not bad, but it was not amazing either.  Lacked flavor/spice for me.  I had even added in some chili powder.  However, it was super easy to make.  If I make again, will definitely add more curry powder.  I also think, instead of using pre- cooked shrimp, I'd like to use raw and cook in some of these spices...I found the shrimp itself flavorless. I served with rice and chili sauce instead of noodles.

Great recipe. But something was missing. It was a tad bland for my taste, but I will surely make it again using a bit more spices.

Although this dish is very tasty, it doesn't have the stronger curry flavor that Singapore noodles usually have (which could simply be solved by adding more powder), but it's a great and easy dish nevertheless.

I enjoyed cooking this dish. I've never cooked with ginger root before, and was suprised at how it enhanced the flavor. Good dish to cook if you want to impress someone. ;-)

this recipe was delicious. it had a subtle but good taste to it.i substituted soybeans instead of peas.the rice noodles acquired the taste very well.
