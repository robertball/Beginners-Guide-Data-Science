I'm not sure I should be rating this because my stupid grocery store didn't have mocha ice cream topping, so I had to use dark chocolate instead. It was delicious though! Perfect for dessert after an Italian meal! Love love love it.

I made a graham cracker crust for this and used Chocolate Cool Whip. Sprinkled crumbled cookies on top. So delicious!

I give this one star because there is no such thing as SMUCKER'S® Chocolate Mocha Ice Cream Topping. After searching EVERY grocery store in town and searching their website, I settled on another toping. If you go to the smuckers site, you can plainly see that the reciepe calls for Smucker's® Special Recipe™ Milk Chocolate Flavored Topping. I will defanitly not attempt to make this pie again.

I generously rate this recipe with two stars because the mousse is actually pretty good.  The Smuckers sauce called for in the recipe does not exist so mixed Hershey's Chocolate sauce and some Nestle's Iced Java to get the chocolate mocha flavor.  There was WAY to much sauce!  Maybe if I used half the sauce I could have salvaged the dessert.    Nope will definitely not make this again.
