Absolutley delicious summertime meal!  I have always had a phobia of using uncooked, fresh tomatoes in a sauce but I've been converted!  lol  My husband loves red onions and Italian dressing so I decided to give this recipe a try. I used four beefsteak tomatoes (my plum romas were not ripe yet) that I picked from my garden and I seeded and diced them.  Then I picked a big handful of basil and chopped that up.  I added 1/2 cup of Good Seasons Salad dsg ( that I had made with balsamic vinegar...I noted that alot of recipes for fresh tomato sauce add balsamic vinegar so that is how I incorporated it into this one). Finally, I used angel hair because that is what I had.  It is just an explosion of freshness and summer in your mouth when you eat this.  I highly recommend!

I just loved this but I don't use or buy Italian dressing and I omitted the raw onion - straight olive oil  and a little fresh minced garlic worked for me instead. Served this with "Grandma Bogie's Parmesan Chicken," recipe also from this site.

This is excellent. I added about 1 teaspoon of miniced garlic. This is wonderful hot, but I liked it better as a nice refreshing macaroni salad! Also would consider adding a can of olives for the salad.

This was fantastic.I made it tonight for dinner and we loved the flavor of all the mixture. I did like the other lady said about balsamic vinager. I used the bottle dressing. It was so good. I also chopped, (In my food processor) celerey, green onions & mushroom's very fine and sauteed  them in olive oil and added them to the pasta and then added the chopped tomatoes. I tossed it all together with the other ingredient's while in the hot pan, and served it warm. The olive oil that it was used to cook the veggies really added to it. It was so good. Thank you for the recipe.

This was very quick, easy, and tasty.  Very light for summer!  I used Farfalle pasta, 6 roma tomatoes, chopped roasted red peppers and a small can of sliced black olives.  I only had a handful of fresh basil, so I used that plus some dried.  I skipped the onion because my family doesn't care for it.  I added more grated parm than called for in the recipe.  Even my picky 8 year old liked this, and my 12 year old said it was a keeper!  Good warm and cold too!!

I had my doubts, but it worked out just fine. I made it according to the recipe and I thought the dressing was a little overpowering. I then drizzled a little olive oil on it and it was much better. I'll be making this again.

Quick, easy, and delicious! This is perfect for summer, when fresh tomatoes are so abundant. I used angel hair pasta and opted out the red onion. For the "Italian dressing", I kept it very, very simple and used a mix of olive oil and minced garlic. It doesn't get much better or much simpler than this!

I'm not sure if this is supposed to be eaten warm or cold, but I made it cold, and it was a nice light pasta salad.  It's easy to make and a great way to use basil and tomatoes from a garden.  I used an Italian dressing mix and just threw all the ingredients together in the bowl rather than mixing it separately, so I wound up using more dressing than the recipe called for, but it's good that way.  I made the dressing with balsamic vinegar and olive oil (I'll probably reduce the oil next time to make it healthier).  After tasting the salad, I added extra onion, which I feel was an improvement.  I think it would also benefit from more basil and maybe some garlic as suggested by other reviewers.

This sounded good until you got to the part with the bottled dressing.  Instead, I would have sauteed some garlic and olive oil and then proceeded from there.

I added parmasan plus an italian blend of cheeses.  And, I added garlic and lots of italian seasoning, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes for more flavor.  I used Roasted Pepper Italian Dressing - and I added fresh vegetables like broccoli, mushroom, zucchini, bell pepper and olives.  Quite healthy and pretty tasty!  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty (and EASY).  Two things I look for.  I did add some garlic as previously recommended, but also threw in some left over BBQ chicken (w/out the sauce) we had from the night before.  That turned out to be a nice addition.  This is a very nice summer dish we'll be doing again.  Thanks.

We make this quite often now.  We use the Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix and use Balsamic vinegar for extra flare and color, rather than using a prepared Italian dressing.  There's never any left overs with this one.

This was awesome!My only regret is finding the recipe at the end of Summer tomato season! I added fresh minced garlic, and for the dressing I used a package of Good Season's Cheese and herbs dressing, subbing Balsamic for regular vinegar. I omitted the onion, but that is just my personal taste. I will definitely be making this again! I would like to try adding cooked shrimp next time! Thanks, Kelcampbell!

I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic chopped and 1/2 cup (maybe more) of a good white wine. I actually cooked the sauce letting it simmer for about an hour. My son who has been to Italy said it was one of the better recipes I have used.

I made this tonight for a quick and healthy dinner for my toddler and I and this was great!  I used angel hair pasta as it was all I had.  It was soo easy to make and tasted wonderful.  The freshness of the roma tomatoes really makes this a great dish.  I meant to add some fresh garlic, but forgot, so I sprinkled some garlic salt on it after everything was mixed up.  There are so many possibilities with this recipe such as adding chicken or shrimp and fresh veggies!  This is a keeper!

Very light and fresh.  I used chopped garlic and sprinkled with red pepper flakes.   Got the basil and tomatoes out of the garden and we will make this easy dish again.

I really loved this with a few additions... I added balsamic, minced garlic, green onion, roasted red peppers and artichoke hearts and also used low-fat italian dressing.  Sprinkled servings with a little feta and it was an amazing side dish.  So fresh and perfect for summertime

If you're looking for a quick & easy, no nonsense meal that's tasty - look no further.  I wouldn't serve it for guests though (except as a side dish) without some doctoring. For me, this is the perfect "basic" recipe to broaden my repertoire of heavy Italian/pasta dishes to include a lighter, fresher approach as the hot summer months loom.  I test drove this recipe tonight with turkey Italian sausage that I browned with onions in EVOO, added sherry & reduced. Put it in a large S/S bowl & mixed in:  Girard's Champagne Vinaigrette, balsamic vinegar, 6 cloves pressed garlic, plum tomatoes, more basil than recipe, and seasoned with salt & pepper before tossing with angel hair pasta.  It was so yummy my family loved it!  Even my picky 3 year old carnivore ate it up.  Next week I'm going to make it with clams, substituting Italian dressing & tomato for a white wine & clam juice reduction with zucchini, yellow squash & red bell peppers.  After that, maybe prosciutto, asparagus, and pine nuts with sun-dried tomato dressing or shrimp with Brussels sprouts and fresh pesto.  The possibilities are endless!

Dorot chopped basil cubes made this easy for a winter carb craving.  I added a touch of minced garlic, a shake of Parmesan, and some ground black pepper.

As others have commented, it's a very easy recipe with little prep time, and it results in a very light, tasty pasta dish. It is best served with fresh ingredients (basil, tomatoes) rather than canned/dry. It's also very welcoming to modifications. I omitted the onions (personal taste), used whole wheat penne, and added some crushed red pepper. Tastes good cold or hot. Next time I will try angel hair pasta and add some cubed avocado, black olives, and garlic (maybe toasted pine nuts, too), and serve with garlic bread!

This was wonderful!  I improvised a bit (added chicken, fresh mushrooms, and garlic) but the Italian dressing (I used Good Seasonings), basil (I used dried), and Parmesan cheese make this sauce something worth serving again and again!  I grow Amish paste tomatoes - like Romas, but bigger - and this was a great way to use the end of the season bounty now that the canning is done!  I will definitely be making again for guests!

I too made this with angel hair pasta.  I also had some leftover baked chicken that I cut up and added (2 breasts).  My family really enjoyed this meal.   It was extremely light yet flavorful too.  My husband and I ate the rest for lunch the next day and didn't even heat it up.  It was even better cold, in my opinion.

Really nice! I was worried about the tomatoes being left in a raw state, but it was wonderful. I will definitely make this dish again. It is likely to become a regular!

I made this exactly as written. It was good but a little bland. I suspect the problem may be with the bottled Italian dressing I used. I plan to make this again using a good homemade dressing.

Tried this today, and loved it.  The only changes I made were to add garlic and onion, which are staples for me when it comes to pasta.  Thanks for this truly simple, delicious recipe!

delicious, healthy, fresh. I added  little balsamic vinegar and that gave it a kick. It does get better the longer the flavors have a chance to meld. Great quick meal for lunch or dinner!

This was really tasty. My family really enjoyed this. We ate it hot for dinner and then the leftovers cold the next day. Both ways good but I think I prefer it cold.  Great as a light dinner with garlic bread or as a side dish.

I made it exactly as the recipe listed.  It was seved hot, and was very good.  The raw onion was a little strong.  We rated it a 4, then I added some cold leftover chopped roast chicken and some homemade riccotta cheese crumbles which took it to 5 stars.  Thanks for a new twist on pasta.  Still have some leftover for lunch tomorrow, and I will see how it tastes cold.  Good I bet.

This was good. A light meal that's quick & easy to prepare. We used Newman's Family Recipe Italian & a bit of salt & pepper. I'd say some chopped red pepper would be a nice addition. Next day just added more dressing & had it as a cold side dish. This would be EASY to change to suit your individual tastes.

I am 14 years old and a full Vegetarian but my family isn't. It's hard for me to find healthy vegan foods that the whole crew can enjoy but i finally found one! I just got done making this *except i used penne rigate noodles instead and hunts fire roasted canned tomatos* and it is AMAZING!!!!!! I might have to cook this every Monday when we have nothing planned ^_^

Actually I love this Recipe ... The only thing I did different is Roasted Garlic in the oven and added it to the sauce..... Instead of a lot of Italian dressing I used half and some chicken Broth.

SO good! Even my picky hubs liked this!!! I especially really enjoyed the addition of Italian dressing in this and would have never thought to use it for this purpose! This paired especially well with our grilled pork chops, but I'm sure this would make a yummy meatless entree too. I'll definitely be making this all summer long! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Kel! :-)

This recipe turned out very good. I did have to add more dressing but I used angel hair pasta and think that may have been why it was dry.

This was a very tasty side dish and quick to whip together. I changed the recipe a little by putting in 1 Tb of butter instead of the dressing. I totally recommend this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! I make this all the time and it's easy to put your own spin on it each time.  I added some sweet peppers and a touch of oregano and it was delicious. I cut up all the vegetables in a food processor. It saved a lot of time and it was easier to eat the veggies with the pasta.

We liked this very much.  My only issue with it is that it gets cold so fast because of the uncooked tomatoes but the flavor is great.  My family loved it.
I did change it slightly adding garlic and using Balsamic dressing.  I also added the chicken from a store-bought Rotesserie for my kids' liking.  Very good use of our bounty of tomatoes from our garden.  This is a keeper.

I NEVER use bottled dressing or packaged convenience foods, so I used extra virgin olive oil and fresh herbs from my garden--oregano, marjoram, thyme, minced garlic, and PLENTY of fresh basil. More than the recipe requested. I also used more fresh garden tomatoes. Yum!

I made this recipe and my husband and I agreed it's a keeper.  I added 2 large  garlic cloves minced and 1/2 lb. of crisp bacon.  The bacon added a great flavor and so did the garlic.  It was light and fresh tasting with the tomatoes, basil and red onion.  What a perfect dinner for a warm summer evening.

I love this recipe!! I was afraid to cook it for my husband because he's not a huge fan of tomatoes or raw onions, so I only used 5 tomatoes rather than 8, but WOW. It turned out incredible. I let it cook for a while once I got all the ingredients in the pasta. I also used roasted red pepper Italian dressing at the recommendation of another review. I paired it with roasted garlic sautéed chicken that I cut up and mixed in right before serving. He went back for seconds it turned out so well and I'm eating it again today for lunch! It is so flavorful it definitely doesn't even need any type of protein added, but it does work well with chicken. If you're on the fence about this, just try it out and you will not be disappointed!!

Loved this recipe! This is perfect for using the tomatoes and basil from the garden. I used about 8 tomatoes and a fistful of basil. I was a little too careful with adding the raw onion, now I wish I had added more because it was just SO good. I added Garlic Powder and salt and pepper (the dressing I used didn't have much sodium). The meal was ready in no time. I highly recommend.

I followed recipe as written but used 2 tsp dried basil over fresh and 6 tomatoes instead all due to what I had on hand.  Recipe didn't wow me and I do not feel minor changes impacted rating.  I used Olive Garden's light Italian dressing.  This is basically a pasta salad with different pasta shape choice if served cold. I may add diced cooked chicken next time and make some personal preference changes.

I originally made this recipe for my 5-year-old who loves tomatoes (personally, I am not a fan of raw tomatoes). However, one taste, and I was hooked - absolutely delicious!

Really simple recipe. Other than boiling the pasta, this recipe only takes a minute to make. Chop up some tomatoes and red onion. Slice some basil. Toss cooked pasta with the rest of the ingredients including Italian dressing, parmesan cheese, salt, and garlic. I garnished this with crumbled feta.

Super easy, quick, and delicious. This is a perfect meal for a weekday where you work late. In the same amount of time it would take to run to Taco Bell, you could have a home-cooked meal.

My husband hates pasta salad...any pasta with salad dressing  BUT he loved this!Went back for seconds!   I used 3 cheese tortellini...with Good Seasons Italian dressing. I also added some cooked, canned, seasoned peas.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing.  But I must say, the video for this recipe called for Roma tomatoes but the tomatoes they chopped up were NOT Romas.

I am learning how to cook, so I wanted to try something simple. This was perfect, easy to make. Also, someone took the tomatoes I bought... so I used salsa. Takes away from the healthy directive for this meal, but it tasted pretty good. I recommend this to someone looking to make something quick and simple.

LOVED THIS PASTA!!  It's so simple!  For the families sake I cooked the red onion in a little oil to take away the rawness.  Not sure how you call this tomato sauce but anyhow...so good!

A little bland just counting the end product, although likely due to me not adding enough of specific ingredients. Also worth noting is I left out the basil on this one. Other than that, a solid dish.

Fresh, easy, and delicious. I sauteed the onions and some garlic, added the tomatoes for long enough to get them warm, then added to the pasta.  I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar.

This was really good, made a great quick and healthy dinner.  Easy to tweak according to personal preference, yet tasty & kid friendly just as it is.  I did pan-fry some smoked sausage to add in, for my kids.

Delicious! I left out the Parmesan cheese, as I didn't have any on hand, used rigatoni instead of penne, and dried basil instead of fresh. The dressing I used was a combo Italian/Balsamic Vinegar, and it was great. Quick and easy, a definite keeper. Thanks Kelcampbell.

Quick, easy and delicious. The only change I made was to add a couple of minced cloves of garlic. We had it with salad and garlic bread. Thanks, Kelly!

Enjoyed it very much!  Added a bit of garlic and bell peppers and used Italian seasoning with olive oil and balsamic vinegar instead of store bought Italian dressing. Even better the following day!  Will definitely make it again.

I used whole wheat pasta instead of bleached, and also 2 cans of diced tomatoes works fine if you don’t have tomatoes! Dried or frozen basil also works well if you don’t have any fresh. I would personally add a tiny bit more cheese next time

We had to improvise, but it turned out great. I'm not a fan of raw onion, so we sauteed garlic and onion, threw in 6 tomatoes, sauce, cheese etc and cooked that a couple minutes to warm it through. We also added a leftover chicken breast and pesto, and used some long skinny egg noodles. Can't wait to throw this together again!

Absolutely delicious! I added a whole cumcuber to add a bit of freshness and crunch and it went along nicely. I may use a different type of noodle next time, however.

This is VERY similar to Weight Watchers capellini with fresh tomato sauce recipe. ( publisbed in their cookbook) They use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar plus 2 tablespoons  olive oil, instead of dressing ; Plus they add 3 cloves of garlic minced. Their pasta is capellini (angel hair). The addition of fresh garlic is a must in my opinion. (I do 4 cloves) Also their recipe just lists 1 onion instead of a measured amount Although the Weight Watcher directions are  a bit different too. It is made 4 hrs or so ahead of time...." Mix all except pasta & parm cheese in a non-reactive bowl         ( REALLY IMPORTANT)  cover, and let sit covered for @ least  4. Hours...Then toss w/cooked pasta. If you can plan ahead this really lets the flavor develope, and is definately woth it.. Just be sure to avoid using anything reactive for your bowl( not in an aluminum bowl)The acid on the tomatoes and the vinegar can react with aluminum..and give a weird taste to your dish. 
Because of the garlic, and the sit time, I think the Weight Watchers version is a better recipe.BUT this is pretty good too...just add garlic. Fresh minced Italian parsley is another good add in option

I chose to saute the onion and tomatoes (and used only 5 roma tomatoes) before tossing them with the pasta. It turned out fantastic! This is now one of my top 5 go-to recipes.

This turned out better than I thought it would. I’m not a huge fan of tomatoes so instead of using eight I only used to that followed the directions to a T other than that. A must try!

Hack recipe. Using bottled dressing instead of olive oil, vinegar, fresh garlic etc. is the equivalent of cream of mushroom soup.
If your gonna' swing a knife this much, then make it from scratch.

We used fresh garden tomatoes, protein pasta, red onion that I cooked a little in the bottom of the pan that I cooked the pasta in and balsamic dressing.  Mixed it all together.  It was fast and it was great!  We will do it again.

My family loved this so much, that there were NO leftovers!  Would give it 5 stars,  except that it cooled down pretty fast.  Need to find a way to keep it hot once it hits the plate.  Otherwise, great tasting meal that's not too filling...just right.

This was really good.  I made some modifications to mine.  I substituted green onions for the red onions.  I also added fresh parsley - very flavorful.

Quick and easy. I use EVO and garlic. I add chopped peppers from the garden. Good recipe to use whatever you have on hand.

Nice combination of flavors. I made it into a cold salad. The tomatoes got a little mushy after a day in the fridge, so I didn't eat it all. Good though.

I make this quite often but use olive oil with freshly chopped garlic, kosher salt & cracked white or black pepper & a good sized bunch of chiffonade basil in place of bottled dressing. No red onion as my family dislikes onion, but I'd use it if it was just myself. I let my tomato mixture sit for an hour so the flavors will blend nicely. A topping of freshly grated parmesan or asiago (a family fave) and you've got a wonderful dish liked by all.  It's also very good with grilled chicken breast sliced thinly & arranged nicely on top of each serving.

Liked everything about this but instead of adding pasta to cold ingredients I cooked them with some chicken and used angel hair pasta. Next time I will try it the other way.

Super easy, done in minutes! I didn't have red onions so used white, & didn't have parmesan so used Romano & I used more dressing than the recipe recommended because i like things spicy ;-) It's a great cold salad for BBQ night!

Quite possibly a little overkill on seasoning, none the less this is an amazing healthy choice.
Like a previous poster, I added a bit of balsamic vinegar and garlic for added awesomeness. 
Will be making plenty of times over in the near future.

Great recipe for summertime! As a novice cooker, I appreciated how simple the recipe was. I ate a plate of this dish right after I prepared it. Still hot, I was not very impressed. I kept thinking something was missing. I refrigerated it overnight and tried it again for lunch the next day. It was a amazing the way the flavors set in! This dish is MUCH better cold than it was hot. I gave it 4 stars because I substituted garlic for onion. I mostly did this because I'm a garlic girl and I didn't have any onion laying around.

Great summery main dish!  Used fresh garden tomatoes and it was wonderful with the fresh basil.  Very, very easy to make, too.  There seemed to be too much pasta in relation to other ingredients, so I added more tomatoes, dressing, basil and cheese.  We had this for dinner with corn on the cob and.... Fabulous Fruit Salad!

We liked this pasta. I used wheat pasta and added fresh garlic and green pepper.
