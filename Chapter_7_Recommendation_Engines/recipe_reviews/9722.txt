Super thin and crunchy, almost toffee-like.  I used dark corn syrup just because it's all i had.  I also added 1/4teaspoon Cardamom just for the heck of it.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, anything like that would also be yummy. They're probably great without any additions though.  
     They spread ALOT!  I dropped 1/2 teaspoons full, and only put 6 cookies per baking sheet.  I baked them on parchment paper, for 8-9 minutes, took the parchment paper off the cookie sheet and onto my countertop, to cool them quickly.

Lacy and crunchy, especially on the outside edges. For my oven, the cooking time was too long, so the first cookies were slightly burned. 7 minutes seemed to be enough for mine, but every oven is different. If you use only a teaspoon of batter, there are way more than 30 cookies here. I stopped after 48, but there was still batter left. Served for dessert with freash strawbeeries and blueberries and vanilla bean ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!

After making this recipe and reviewing others I have concluded there is way too much butter, came out very slimy. I am going to retry with 1/4 cup as listed in similar recipes.
