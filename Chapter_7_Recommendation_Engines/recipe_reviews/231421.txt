These were really good but I would cut back the salt next time.  We did these with syrup and some with honey butter.  I think they would be awesome along side some chili.

Tried it as stated, but as others had found batter was runny.  I added 2/3 cup flour to the batter and it behaved nicely.  This recipe would be great with corn and/or jalepeno's added too!

This recipe is...interesting. But surprisingly good when topped with the right toppings! I was a little taken aback by how they cooked up - not like a real pancake at all! I was very leery to try these, but I topped them with some berries, whipped cream and pure maple syrup and I can honestly say these were amazing with those toppings! These cakes just soaked up the syrup and berry juices so each bite was sweet and delicious! Reminds me ever so slightly of the pancakes that my Grandma made when I was growing up - thin and absorbent!

The batter was too liquid, so I had to add more cornmeal.  I cooked on medium low heat (4 out of 9 on an electric stove), otherwise the outside browned too fast.  The final result was very tasty.  The pancakes can be topped with sweet or savory toppings, since there is no sugar in the batter.

I made these and loved them! I was tired of regular pan cakes. I added half the salt it asked for, and a tsp of sugar. Put butter and strawberry jelly on them. They were awesome. Tasted like butter popcorn with strawberry sauce on them.

Really good. my kids and I ate the whole batch. I used real buttermilk (which unlike some people believe is completely impossible to get whole fat), and I'm horrible about exact measurements. I added a handful more cornmeal when I realized it wasnt thick enough. I also added a tiny bit more butter. will be making these again

I followed the recipe except I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted a vinegar/milk combo.  They were REALLY salty.  The batter was a weird consistency too....  They ended up looking like something between a thin pancake and a crepe, and as a result were hard to flip.  I'd make them again, but next time I'll only use a fraction of the salt.

I didn't have buttermilk so used milk with vinegar. Watery batter and impossible to control on the griddle. If you make it as written be sure to use buttermilk itself and full fat at that to help hold it all together. Taste was ok. We salvaged the batter and made muffins.

I made these. I used the suggestions of another user of adding 2/3 cup of flour mine was baking gluten free flour. It was very thick so the hubby added some maple syrup and it was perfect. Will definitely do it again with these modifications.

I used 1 tablespoon of vinegar and enough whole milk to make a cup.  Husband loved them.

A perfect all corn (gluten free!) pancake. These are very light.   I made them to go with chili.   Could easy add some onion, or cheese for a more savory complement to fish, pork chops.

If you add have corn flour and half corn meal it works better.

I did not care for this recipe. While the cakes tasted alright the problem is the batter is all liquid with a little bit of cornmeal. Controlling the batter while cooking it is difficult and the batter in the middle of the cakes will not cook until you flip.

I thought these were scrumptious!  Unfortunately, my 4 kids (super-picky eaters, aged 3-9) wouldn't eat them, so I only gave them 4 stars.  I would have given them 5 stars for myself.  They were yummy!  I did cook them in olive oil instead of cooking spray and had to cook them for a few minutes longer on each side.  I ate them with butter only, and they were wonderful and savory.
