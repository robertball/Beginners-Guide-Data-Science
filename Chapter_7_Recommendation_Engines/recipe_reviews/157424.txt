Kids thought this was great. I used a frozen banana which eliminated the need for the ice cubes, low sugar instant oatmeal and omitted the Splenda. I made one, then turned around and made another. They LOVED it.

Very good.  Have made both as written (very good) but also skipping the ice, with half a frozen banana and 1/2 cup sliced chilled peaches (I like less banana).  Very filling and very good flavor!  Look forward to playing around with different flavors of the various ingredients - the proportions are great, I would just skip the ice - freeze the banana instead.

It was pretty good, given the gritty texture you'd expect from adding oatmeal. There are changes I'd make to it to make it better: use frozen peaches (put them in first), plain rolled oats, skip the sucralose and use a little honey instead, plain yogurt, and only enough milk to almost cover the fruit. Also, I'd add some ground flax seed for omegas. Thanks for the idea!

Made it as written and it gets five stars from me (and my 16 year old son ... he asks for it every morning).  Have since made some changes to suit our tastes... we eliminate the sweetener and use sweetened Original Almond Breeze almond milk in lieu of the regular milk.   Also we freeze the bananas, add three or four whole frozen strawberries, and skip the ice entirely. I use a half cup of yogurt (instead of 1/4) and 1 cup of milk (instead of 1 1/4) to make it a bit thicker.   We buy the multi-pack of fruit 'n' cream oatmeal and use whatever flavor happens to be in the front.  I grind up the oatmeal packet in a coffee grinder to make it a fine powder, so the final result is very smooth.  This is an easy, healthy, and tasty recipe.  Kudos to Susanb36 for posting this one, we love it!!!

The oatmeal gives this smoothie great texture and more vitamin. I have made it exactly as written, and also tried different flavors of oatmeal and fruit. A favorite version: add a package of vanilla instant breakfast, which eliminates the need to add sugar/sweetner, use 2 strawberrys and cream oatmeal packets, and whatever flavored yogurt you have on hand.

Originally I gave this two stars, but it's much better with 1/4 cup of plain rolled oats and 3/4 cup milk. It is a very pale color, next time I will try adding blueberries for some color.

This smoothie tasted like liquid oatmeal.  It was as if I had cooked the oatmeal, let it cool and then put it in a blender with ice and a banana. All I could taste was the oatmeal and the texture was rough, completely opposite of "smoothie"...It filled me up too much so I will stick to leaving instant oatmeal out of my smoothies.

Only thing I changed was instead of peaches and cream, I used Strawberry and Cream and added two fresh strawberries. I just had stomach surgery, so this was a 100% hit with me. THANKS FOR SHARING!!

My daughter and I had this for breakfast, but I made a few changes. I used strawberries and cream oatmeal and put it in the blender first to get it like a powder. (This should help with the texture issues.) Then I added the rest of the ingredients, using a frozen banana, omitting the ice and omitting the sweetner. Also, I used strawberry banana yogurt. This was okay, but I think I prefer using regular oats and all fresh fruit in my smoothies. I might try it again sometime though. Thanks for the idea.
