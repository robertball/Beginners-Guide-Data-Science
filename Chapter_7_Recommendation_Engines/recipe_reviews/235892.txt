This is a delicious smoothie loaded with lots of different fruit flavors.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of plain and added more ice because we like our smoothies thick.  IMO Truvia® is the best of the sugar substitutes with no aftertaste or artificial flavor.  And I'm not saying that just because this is their recipe, I seriously believe it's that good.

This is really yummy – I didn't use the ice but froze the strawberries and blueberries. That seemed to make it cold. I also used plain Greek yogurt.

My husband is an extremely picky eater, and yet he LOVES this smoothie! I didn't change a thing, but next time I would try to omit the truvia.

Loved it. didn't have all the ingredients so used flavored LaYogurt and Passion fruit juice. Kids and Wife wanted seconds. this is a keeper.
