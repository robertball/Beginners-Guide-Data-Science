Verry tasty eggs
I did three things different though.
1. I used minced garlic
2. I used red wine vinager
3. I added a teaspoon of dill weed
My 12 yr old who swore she would never eat a pickeled egg ended up eating them all on me. So now I need to make more.

Made these for my bar.  Have used different recipes for making pickled eggs, but chose this one because of the addition of red onions.  After about 2 days the onions turned white.  I made a few changes, used almost a pure vinegar mixture, added fresh jalapenos, and added pepper corns.

My husband loves pickled eggs and wanted to make his own at home.  We waited the full week before trying these.  They were very tasty.  We did add a pinch of dill and some pickling spice.  Also used red onion and smashed garlic cloves.  Will make again.

Adjusted the vinager/water to 1 3/4 vinager and 1/4c water. Cut the sugar in half. Added pickling spices and some fresh hot cherry peppers (diced) and ZOWIE! This is a keeper. I doubled the recipe and use an old gallon pickle jar stuffed with as many eggs as we can stuff into it. Awesome. ps, someone suggested coarse chopping garlic, I think we will do that on the next batch.

I have made these a few times with just a few changes. I double up on the vinegar, add 1 tsp pickling salt, 2 Tbsp pickling spice, and a dried chilli pepper to spice it up a bit. We love them, and I have shared the recipe with many friends. Thanks

This was good.  Hard for me to rate because I have nothing to compare it to, as I have never had pickled eggs.  I make my hard boiled eggs different that what is stated.  I put the eggs in a pan covered with cold water.  I bring the water to a boil, remove the pan from the heat, cover and let sit 20 minutes. After 20 minutes run cold water over the eggs until water in the pan is replaced with cold water. Let eggs soak in cold water until the eggs are cold. I have never had eggs stick to the shell making them this way.

Wonderful!!! Used red wine vinegar, shallots instead of onions, crushed garlic out of a jar, and added a tablespoon full of whole black pepper corns.  Making 2 more batches to put in the fridge!

Good base flavor, but needs a little "something"...maybe some pickling spices? Salt? Still, enjoyable.

My fiance and I did not like this.  When we tasted that eggs there was no pickled flavor.  All we got was onions and garlic.  Not sure if I did anything wrong but they didn't turn out.

Perfect! No changes needed in the recipe! Added some red vinegar for color. Substitued 1/8 cup of salt for sugar for those who prefer it. A solid general recipe. Perfect as it is!

Looks like I'm in the minority here. Like a couple of other reviewers, I'd never had pickled eggs before, but was willing to give it a try. I made the recipe to spec (except for storing it in a Tupperware-like container since I didn't have a jar big enough).
I waited the full week, and consumed the eggs over the next week. I found the flavor to be very blah, and, most importantly, could hardly taste any garlic at all! I used fresh garlic cloves, but maybe they should have been chopped or minced instead of being used whole. The vinegar flavor was ok, not too strong, but I even tasted a lot more of the onion flavor than I did the garlic.
I don't think I'll make this again, but maybe I'll give a different pickled-egg recipe a try.

I enjoy these eggs.  My husband hates them!  Just so you know, 12 eggs, one onion, etc. don't fit into the jar called for!  No way!  You need to either use a bigger jar, two jars, or less ingredients.  The onions turn white.  The eggs get very rubbery.  I think it's a yummy treat from the standard hard boiled egg.  I will make these again even though I'm the only one who will eat them!

I used to make something like this for the Marines when they had to eat lunch on the "PAPA" boats and they were loved by all. I used to add some dill to it like whats his face said also.

YUMMY!  It was hard to let them sit for a week but we did.  I'll try adding some extra spices (maybe some chopped garlic and dill like someone else suggested) to it the next time I make it just to see if it enhances the flavor but it was very good as written and I will be making again!  ps. they did look just like the picture shown if you use a red onion, very pretty!

Oh boy. We LOVE garlic, but the flavor here really does border on way too much. I think I'll try slicing them up in a salad; otherwise, I may just have to trash them, and try again with less garlic. Thanks anyway.

Too wimpy though. Go with 1 1/2 cups vinegar to 1/2 cup water and also add 1/2 teaspoon salt.  You only have a week or so to get that flavor into those eggs so don't fool around.

I just tried this today, I also used 1 3/4 cups white vineagar and almost a 1/4 cup of water. I used vidalia onion rings and preminced garlic. I did add some of my own dry rub seasonings that I have had great success in pickiling jalepeno's with as well. Now is the waiting for a week. Wish me luck

I liked these eggs.  I thought that they made a great snack.  My husband didn't really care for them though.  He thought they were too sweet.  I would make them agian for just me but not for the whole family.

Never had pickled eggs before, but I wanted to try them. They looked beautiful as they marinated. (I put in canned beet juice instead of water.) They came out well flavored, but I learned I'm not that crazy about pickled eggs in general. If you like pickled eggs though, this is a great recipe to try!

This recipe is fantastic!  They are so simple to make and my husband loves them.  He is always asking me to make more eggs for him to snack on.  Lots of times, he doesn't even wait the full week, but I think they taste better the longer they set.

Everyone loved this recipe.  Makes the eggs very tasty.  Now, if I could just make hard boiled eggs that the egg didn't stick to the shell it would be perfect.  We will definitely be making this again.

Continued from another review I made..... If you use a cast iron skillet, and cook on medium high like I did. Once the tortillia starts to bubble ( does not take long at all), flip to other side with a spatula, then slap it 10 times, repetitively then remove....it will be done, longer than that, you will most likely burn ( like I did) the tortillia. That's IF you use a cast iron skillet. Also, DO NOT ( like I did) use cooking spray in between ( or at all) while making these. Your house will get smoky to say the least. This was the first time I have ever made tortillias and I WILL make again using this recipe. I will be hard pressed to buy store bought tortillias again. These are so easy to make and great tasting. I gave 5 stars because this recipe is so deserving.

Made these tasty eggs many times, always try to do something a little different each time. I've added 1/4 cup of sliced canned mushrooms and pimentos, makes them look more appealing without changing the flavor. Try adding a teaspoon of crushed red pepper's to add little kick.

I liked this recipe pretty well- although I did add sugar, and kind of mixed the 2 recipes for the garlic eggs and the sweet pickled eggs from this site.....still trying to find the perfect pickled egg, though....

This is such a great easy recipe. I have made it several times since I found it on this site. Sometimes if I‚Äôm feeling a little crazy I‚Äôll add some dill or a jalape√±o!  The hardest part of this dish is hiding it in the fridge so my husband doesn‚Äôt dip into it early!

It's probably just personal preference, but this wass too sweet, and not tart enough. My dad really liked them, so I'm try it again on the chance that I put too many eggs in the jar and not all the liquid.

Spot On! I made them several times as is, but have also added 8-10 small bird or thai peppers to the brine and the extra little kick was a very welcome addition.  Either way I like the simplicity of this recipe, and just to make sure I get the full garlic taste I cut the some of the  cloves into smaller pieces

I just wanted to point out that the Still Tasty web sight says with proper refrigeration, the eggs will keep for three months.  I am so pleased to know that because I am the only one who eats them and I munch when I need a great snack.
