Just tried this tonight for dinner and it was outstanding.  I am a garlic fan so next time I would add a little more garlic, but just as it was, it was excellent.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe, but changed it a little to suit my taste.  I used half red peppers and half green peppers and a lot more garlic.  I also added crushed red pepper to add a little kick.  It turned out great!

I didn't bother with the tomato paste - 1. I didn't want to open a can for just a couple of tbsps. 2. The sauce was decently thick enough already. Personally, I loved the fennel flavor but Husband definitely did not. All in all, this was ok but I thought it needed something else. Maybe a sprinkle of crumbled feta? This recipe would work with chicken or scallops/fish. Thanks.

This is a very healthy and flavorful recipe. I love it. I wanted to serve it over rice and needed more juice, so I doubled the wine, tomatoes, tomato paste, fennel, and thyme. I also omitted 1Tb of the oil. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was so delicious!

I've never tried any version of shrimp Provençal, so it's possible that I don't know what to expect of such a dish, but I wasn't pleased.  It tasted more like a puree of veggies to me, though I didn't use white wine, and didn't have tomato paste (I substituted with tomato sauce).  Obviously I'm no gourmet chef, or this would've been better.  Just don't think I'll try again.

This was very tasty. Next time around I will use 1/2 the tomato paste and Petit cut tomatoes. I think it will make it less tomato and more of the mix of tastes.
Also will try this with Chicken for my daughter in law( shell fish allergy)

So sorry, but we didn't love it. Seemed bland and blah. I just can't place what would improve it.

Very good.  I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to add the sauce from the canned tomotoes so opted not to.  Mistake.  I thought there needed to be more sauce, at least for my taste.  Next time I will add the sauce, more salt and some oregano.

Nice and fresh tasting.  I did not follow recipe completely though.  No fresh thyme (dry only), no wine.  Paired it with steamed broc and peas.  nice dish!

I didn't have the tomato paste so mine turned out slightly thin but still tasty.  Didn't have fennel either...

Awesome recipe!  Very easy.  I took the advice of some other people here and reduced the tomato paste to half, and increased the garlic a little.
Also, I added the basil a few minutes before the ned of cooking to let it combine.

This recipe is AWESOME! We LOVED it!!!
SUCH fresh flavor!!!
PLEASE use ONLY RED bell peppers! They're SO much sweeter! They're SO worth the difference in $$$ (glad we found 'em on sale!) They're SO important to the sweetness in the flavor balance!
I used canned tomatoes, because I was afraid of the skins from fresh.
Not bad, but I'll be using fresh Roma tomatoes the next time! (Pepper skins didn't interfere... why should tomato skins?)
Happy to have my basil plant, in the window... for MORE fresh flavor!
This recipe is dependent on FRESH ingredients!
I'll probably try to get fresh Va. Beach shrimp, for the next batch!

This was great! I sauteed some chopped zucchini with the onion mixture. This was a great summer recipe using everyday items I always have in the house and in the garden.

Delicious and easy recipe, an automatic favorite that will be added immediately to my repeat recipes list! 
I think you could really play around with the seasonings* and have great results. 
* Based on what I had in my pantry, I swapped the seasoning/ herbs listed for Trader Joe’s 21 Seasoning Salute. Full disclosure: also swapped chicken broth for the white wine (because we only buy red wine). 
Did I substantially change the flavor of this recipe? Most likely. Is that one of my biggest pet peeves when reading reviews? Absolutely.
Would I try it seasoned exactly as written? I’ll plead the 5th. Do I recommend this recipe? Absolutely!
Pretty sure I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner... if only we had leftovers!

Outstanding recipe!  My only change was to substitute chicken stock for the wine and I threw in some shiitake mushrooms.  Served it over white rice, it was delicious and an impressive simple to prepare dinner!

This is really good! I had an entire fennel plant from my CSA, so I chopped the whole thing up (bulb, stalk, and leaves) and put it in. I also doubled the liquids, spices, and paste (came out just slightly too watery).  Excellent when served over rice.

I thought this was okay.  I only used 1 Tbs. of tomato paste to not make it too tomato-ey.  I added some butter in place to thicken/silken up the sauce.  Also used 5 roma tomatoes in place of the canned.  I think my changes were good one's.  Still an okay recipe.  Good over rice as suggested, but I think an angel hair pasta would have been better.  The basil was a nice addition!!

I made this, I did sub out the shrimp and subbed in chickpeas to make it vegan. Reserving the liquid in the canned chickpeas. I used fresh rather than canned tomatoes. Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

I altered it slightly to our taste. I used garlic & onion tomatoes & petite tomatoes, a whole can of tomato paste & a can of tomato sauce. Didn't have fennel so instead I used italian seasoning. Make sure to use plenty of garlic & don't leave out the white wine. The white wine made a huge difference when I finally added it (almost forgot!). I also added fresh spinach during the last 5 minutes. Served it over thin spaghetti. This is so versatile & modifiable!

Super yummy!!! I'm cutting down on carbs so I served with steamed asparagus. It was so tasty and filling. I've traveled in France and the combination of veggies and spices was very authentic. This will be a regular in our household.
