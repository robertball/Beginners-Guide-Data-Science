Ok, I'll admit it - as the first reviewer of this recipe I was skeptical because of its large amount of bananas and small amount of sugar.  I also admit I was swayed to try it anyway because of the submitter's identifying himself as "professional." I figured he must know what he's doing! But so do I, and I knew I'd be a tough sell because my favorite banana bread on the planet is one I've made for over 40 years. Well, the verdict is in - I'm sold -  dad_can_cook makes a darn good banana bread! His description is right on. I found it incredibly moist, chock full of banana flavor, light, not nearly as dense as most, and not overly sweet. I had some leftover toasted pecans, so sprinkled some of those over the top rather than the macadamias. Other than that, I followed the recipe as directed and would do so again.  I did find, however, that the baking time was a little off.  I removed mine from the oven at just 58 minutes and wished I would have set it for 55.  Not a dealbreaker though, just watch the baking time carefully. While this won't take the place of my favorite banana bread, it is a great contender. Be sure to have about five, good-sized bananas on hand for this one!

I loved this recipe so much that I joined allrecipes just to review it! I followed the directions for the most part except I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 cup chopped walnuts (instead of macadamia) and 1 cup chocolate chips. It came out moist and full of banana flavor  Another tip: about 10 minutes before removing from oven, brush the top of the loaf with a mix of 1 tsp brown sugar dissolved in 3 tsp of water. It adds a delicious crunch!  *I cooked for a total of 50 minutes = perfect

OMGosh! I am so picky when it comes to banana bread and have searched high and low with so many different recipes to find one that I like. Well let me tell you, the search is over! This bread is awesome! It tastes so much like bananas and its so moist and flavorful, its amazing! I will admit I did use half whole wheat flour for just a tad more fiber, and a tad bit more mashed bananas. SOOOOOOOOOO good! This is my go to recipe from now on. I will not be using any other!

This is GREAT! I did add a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the batter but other than that I made no changes. The macadamia nuts were a wonderful contrast to the banana flavor. My kids and I demolished a whole loaf for breakfast this morning! YUM!

I was very pleased with the way that this Banana Bread turned out! The only changes that I made to the recipe were to cut the caloric and fat content. I substituted Splenda for Sugar, 1/4 cup of Apple Sauce and Â¼ cup of butter instead of the full 1/2 cup of butter, and unsalted Cashews in place of the Macadamia Nuts. I found that the loaf was perfectly cooked after 55 minutes. Thanks again for a great recipe! Finally, a Banana Bread recipe that was not excessively sweet or dense!

I didn't use the nuts since I didn't have any, and substituted chocolate chips instead. Baked it in a rectangular baking dish. Tasted great!

It's time to throw away all of my other banana bread recipes, I've now found the perfect one! Its moist, dense in flavor but not in texture, it's simply put, delicious. Strong in banana flavor, a real winner. I follwed the recipe exactly and will make again, and again, and again.

Delicious! I used 2 cups nanners and a half cup of applesauce due to lack of banana mush and it turned out beautifully. :)

Other than using cold eggs, defrosted (still chilly) bananas, and toasted pecans, I followed the recipe and made banana bread muffins. Yum! Normally I jazz up banana bread recipes with cinnamon or nutmeg but decided to give it a shot to see if it packed the banana punch others have commented on... yes indeed! I'll make this again with room temp ingredients and see how it changes things... for now, I'll enjoy the treat!

I've been making banana bread for years and this has to be the best recipe I've EVER made.  Followed the recipe exactly except I added 1/2tsp of cinnamon.  No need to change a thing-this is a real keeper.

Although the banana bread seemed to be enjoyed at a morning meeting at my home, I didn't find it to be a recipe out of the ordinary or one that I would make again---just OK.

This Banana Bread "IS" Bangin'.  I have made it twice and it has taken the place of any I have made in the past.  Followed the recipe as written, except I had no macadamia nuts.  First time I used Walnuts, second time Pecans.  I don't think it would matter what kind of nuts you used, it is delicious.  So moist, flavorful and yummy!

This was fantastic!  All the recipes I've tried always seem to not have enough banana flavor, or turn out too dry.  Not this one!  My husband and daughter loved it.  Keeper!

This banana bread was AMAZING!  I've been looking for a recipe that is similar to my grandmas- this is close and maybe even better.  The only step I didn't do was have the eggs at room temp, still came out- but I will do that step next time.

Wow! Only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because i made some changes.  I used about a 1/4 cup white sugar and added about 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I also did not measure my bananas; I just added 3 super ripe ones.  I used whole wheat pastry flour as well.  It is SO good! Thanks!

Well, I have to rate the recipe on the actual recipe, not my error! : )   I made a double batch yesterday about 3am when I couldn't sleep. Bad idea!  I accidentally doubled the amount of butter called for in the recipe. Needless to say, mine didn't raise up right, and were pretty greasy! Ha ha! But, the underlying flavor was fantastic. I also put demerara sugar on the bottom of the pans and on the top. It made a pretty sparkle to the loaves and added a little sweet burst. I'll make it again during normal hours - I am sure we'll enjoy it very much!

Yery yummy and easy. Like another reviewer I cut the amount of butter in half and substituted with applesauce (1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup applesauce). I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips and used walnuts instead of macademia. Mine took the whole 60 min. to bake, I guess ovens differ, so check after 50 min. It took 5 big bananas, so make sure you have enough before starting. My husband and his friend also thought it was great.

I really like this recipe. I HAVE NEVER MADE ANY TYPE OF BREAD BEFORE. This was so easy to bake. Although it really did not matter if the eggs went 2 at a time VS 1 at a time...IT TASTES GREAT. EVEN ADDED 1 EXTRA BANANA IN ONE BATCH. I have over the coarse of this weekend made 10 loafs of this Bangin Banana Bread. GOOD JOB...

I made muffins instead of a loaf. Same temp (350) but for 30 min. instead of 60. Moistness and texture were great. I found the 1/2 cup of sugar did not make sweet enough muffins for my liking. Will probably double sugar next time I make this recipe.

I joined AllRecipes just to rate this bread because it was SO good!!! Perfectly moist, and very flavorful. I used 3 lg. bananas and it was perfect! I also added approx. 1-1 1/2 cups of Coconut, my fav. instead of the nuts. Was delish!! Also holds up well for Banana Bread French Toast!! Mmmm mmmm!

We love this recipe and it has become one of our favorite banana bread recipes.

I doubled the recipe this time and baked them in four 6 X 3 X 3 inch pans for 40 minutes because a single recipe is simply not enough for us (we are three)

I used a 50/50 blend of white and brown sugar and used walnuts instead of macadamia because that is what I had.

Turned out GREAT!

Great banana bread!  The flavor is awesome.  The changes I made were I cut the butter in half and added 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar,  skipped the salt, and I added some cinnamon.  I have never made banana bread where I pureed the bananas and that is the reason why I am not giving this 5 stars.  My bread was "too moist" - a little pudding like.  Next time I make this I will just mashed the bananas rather than puree.

I normally make "Janet's Rich Banana Bread" recipe from allrecipes.com, but I was out of sour cream so I decided to try this recipe.

Bangin' banana bread was more dense than "janet's rich banana bread".  I prefer not to puree the bananas - but I did per the recipe instructions.  I also left out the nuts.

I cooked the bread for 60 minutes in a glass pan and this was too long.

I would only make this recipe again if I was out of sour cream and had really ripe bananas - otherwise, I would go back to "Janet's Rich Banana Bread".

I did not care for this recipe.  However, my ingredients were not at room temperature and I think that is important.  My bananas had been frozen so they were very cold and when I mixed them in things got a little clumpy.  The flavor was not sweet enough for me.  Guess I 'll stick with my old standby.

Very good banana flavor, nice high rise, good crumb, I think this may be my new favorite banana bread.  It does take a lot of bananas, but I had some great ones, waiting.  I used 5 medium, very ripe bananas and subbed pecans for macadamia nuts, because I had the pecans on hand.  If I have some macadamia nuts, next time, I will use them, but in my opinion, pecans or English walnuts will be delicious in this recipe.  It has a rather unorthodox method, and I followed the method to a "T", but my mixer doesn't really do very well with small amounts.  I will use a hand mixer, next time.  Believe me, there will be a next time!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Delicious! Light, moist and full of flavor. I used pecans instead of macadamia nuts and it was perfect. If you are looking for a dense banana bread, this isn't it. But if you like the idea of simple ingredients without a ton of sugar (which you won't miss in this recipe!), this is fabulous!

I only had 3 ripe bananas, so that's all I put in and it was a bit dry. Other than not having enough banana, it was very good and tasty! Most recipes only call for 2 or 3 bananas... Next time I'll plan according.

Delicious recipe! I used brown sugar and that was my only "tweak". I doubled the recipe and baked in a Wilton long loaf pan.  I added a topping of brown sugar and cinnamon.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is the best banana bread I have ever made. Very moist not and not too dense. My co-workers love when I bring it into the office.  The only thing I have changed is the nuts.  Sometimes I omit them and sometimes I use pecan chips. Thanks for the recipe.  :)

I used two ripe bananas and used mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. I cut the sugar by half a table spoon and baked in a glass loaf pan in a convection toaster oven for 50minutes. Crust looked really good but the loaf I found a bit dry.
