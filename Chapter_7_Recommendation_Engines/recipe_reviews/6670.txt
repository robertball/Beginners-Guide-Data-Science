This is the BEST bread recipe! I make it at least twice a week (6 kids.) The flavor is sensational--my very favorite. A few changes to make it easier, more nutritious, and fluffier.  I use 100% whole wheat flour (no white flour) I use instant yeast and I do add 2 tbsp each of dough enhancer, lecithin, and vital wheat gluten. This  bread is so light, fluffy, and delicious everybody just LOVES it. I don't do all the separate rising stages anymore, too much work, too much time, and too much mess. I just throw all the ingredients in at once, mix it up, knead it, put it in the loaf pans, (if you coat your hands with crisco this is much cleaner and easier) put them in the oven with the oven light on to rise, then when they are risen enough turn the oven on and bake them. It doesn't hurt them at all to be in the oven while it preheats. The loaves come out perfect: light, fluffy, and absolutely delicious.

I scaled the recipe to 20 and made this in my bread machine using the 1.5lb loaf whole wheat setting. It came out excellent!The best wheat bread I have ever made in my machine and I make bread daily. I din't have any lemon juice so I substitued it for water and it still worked GREAT!

This is an excellent heavy, grain bread!  The recipe was easy to follow with well-known ingredients.  For anyone looking for a healthy bread recipe, I recommend this one!  Also, I varied mine after I got to know the recipe.  You can replace any of the following ingredients (flax seeds, cracked wheat, and sunflower seeds) with equivalent amounts of, old-fashioned oatmeal, sesame seeds, or even cracked bulgur cereal.  For a nice, fancy touch coat your cookie sheets with yellow cornmeal (makes a nice bottom crust on the loaves)!!

I am not an expert at breadmaking and this recipie looked a little intimidating, but it really wasnt difficult to make at all. It turned out so delicious! I brought it in for my coworkers to try and they thought it was great too, even better than our favorite local bakery, some thought. And when I got home from work my honey had eaten half a loaf by himself! I would highly recommend this bread to wheat bread lovers like us.

I've made this bread a few times now, and with fantastic results each time.  Lovely taste and great texture.  I scaled it down to 18 servings so it would work in my bread machine, and I used egg whites in place of the whole egg.  I've made it with all whole wheat flour, adding 1 T vital wheat gluten, and it still worked.  Works well to grind the sunflower seeds, cracked wheat, and flax seeds so as to hide them from young eyes who wouldn't otherwise eat them!  Love this bread!  Thanks, Dee Dee.

This bread is a winner. It has a great texture--chewy and grainy--plus really good flavor. I didn't have sunflower seeds so I substituted oatmeal in its place. This recipe is VERY large, so it may be better to have or even third it. I divided into 6 small round loaves like the recipes says to and baked individually on a small pan since my oven is tiny. I had to hand form the loaves because they were too sticky to roll out. I ended up using about an extra 1/2 c. of bread flour in kneading, but it never really became kneadable. I ran out of bread flour at that point.  Nonetheless, the bread came out very good. I will make this again and do more subsituting. Maybe add dried cranberries with the sunflower seeds or walnuts and some orange zest.

I did cut this recipe in half. I used my Kitchen Aid from beginning to end instead of making this bread by hand. I proofed my yeast with the ALL of thw warm water and sugar in my mixer bowl. After ten minutes, I added the honey, molasses, melted butter (instead of vegetable oil, I'm out until payday), eggs and lemon juice then all the dry ingredients, beating well with the paddle attachment with each cup of dry, as the recipe stated. I had to add just a touch more of whole wheat flour, just to get it to form into a solid ball. I kneaded with my bread hook for about five minutes or so, then set in a large greased bowl covered with saran wrap and a towel on a warm heating pad to rise for an hour. After it had doubled, I pounded it down and shaped into a loaf and set it to rise in two loaf pans for a half hour or so. I baked it at 350* for about a half hour, maybe a little more. One of the best breads my family has ever had--even my husband raved about it and he's not much for "healthy" bread. My kids and I just loved it. EXCELLENT as breakfast toast. This recipe's a keeper.

This is definitely the bread for us! I was looking for a healthy whole-grain bread recipe that wasn't too dense. This is it! Moist, chewy, and absolutely mouthwatering straight out of the oven. It doesn't last long around here!

This really is great bread. I half this recipe and  make it weekly and we all really enjoy it.  It is simple to make as I omit a few steps - I let my Kitchen Aid mixer to do most the work.  I dissolve the sugar in 1/2 cup warm water and let the yeast rise in it for 10 min.  In the mixer I add the remaining ingredients (3 cups of flour initially)mix it all up with the blending hook, add the yeast, it's been 10 min. by now, change the hook to the dough hook, add the remaining 2.5 cups of flour and walk away for 10 min. while the mixer kneads the dough. This makes 2 nice loaves of bread.  I let it rise in the oven with light on for 2 - 3 hours then turn the oven on to 350 and let it bake for 25.  It always turns out great and with all the ommited steps, it seriously takes 20 min. (don't tell my husband, he thinks it's a major process : ) )  **also, I leave out the sunflower seeds only because it's not something we generally have on hand**

This is an excellent recipe.  The bread has a wonderful texture and cuts easily into slices for sandwiches.  It retains its moisture and doesn't dry out quickly like other bread recipes I have made.  My husband and I both love the taste and the texture of this bread.  Ummmmm, good!

loved it! i used 100% whole wheat flour (i don't see a point in making it less healthy than it could be). i didn't have sunflower seeds but added some unprocessed wheat bran and oatmeal. i tripled the honey, added some wheat gluten to help it rise and stay fresh longer, and added a little extra yeast since i was working with all whole wheat. and, i just threw the ingredients into my bread machine on the dough cycle. when it finished, i let it rise in a slightly warm oven for an hour, then turned on the oven. delicious!

This is awesome bread. I do cut the recipe in half and make two large loaves (instead of 3 small). With a few changes, this is our standard bread that I make once a week and we use it for everything from toast to sandwiches. I use agave juice in place of the sugar and I use a 9-grain mix from my grocery store's bulk bins in place of the cracked wheat. I replace half the water with milk. It is really delicious- nice and soft, good texture, and the taste is to die for!

This bread is AWESOME!  I made a few changes due to personal preference.  I used refined sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  It gave the bread a nice, nutty taste.  I didn't have any cracked wheat, but added a little bit of wheat bran, 2 tbs of sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, and a tbs of poppyseeds.  I also halved the recipe to make three good-sized loaves.  Have a little patience, though, because it takes forever to rise, and will not raise at all after it's in the oven.  After I took the loaves out of the pans and cooled them, I thought for sure they must be full of air pockets because the crust was so soft, but no, when I sliced off a piece it was just so soft and wonderful!  I'm the only one in our family that likes multigrain bread, but I'm a happy girl today!

MMmmm...  one of my favorite restaurant/brewing companies serves a free loaf of excellent grainy wheat bread with every meal, and I was looking for a recipe that would be similar to theirs.  I made this yesterday, scaled down to 20 servings, and ended up with two absolutely perfect loaves.  I added 2 tbsp wheat germ and topped it all off with King Arthur's Artisan Bread topping...  other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and it is positively marvelous.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks!

The bread does not rise very much, I might try to make only 1 loaf with a half recipe so my slices will be big enough to make a sandwich on. However I really enjoy this bread, the flavor and texture are excellent. It is good toasted.

I have looked for a long time for a whole grain bread recipe that works...this really turned out great.  I used no white or bread flour but did add 2tsp of wheat gluten...I really favored this recipe....I recently have fallen in love with another that I got off of my wheat flour bag....but I think this is still very good as I was looking for along while till I found one that actually worked for me and this was it...thanks

This bread came out great! I cut the recipe in half. I did all the kneading and rising in my bread machine. After that, I put the dough in my largest springform pan and baked it in the oven. It rose beautifully. It looked great and tasted wonderful!!:-)

This bread is definitely worth a trip to the health food store for ingredients.  I make bread three times a week for my family, usually rotating through several healthy recipes, but I find myself making this one more often than its fair share!  I love everything about it.  I usually substitute organic sesame seeds for the cracked wheat, and have even omitted the egg before, with great results.

I have tried this recipe with a few minor changes... I substituted the grains for Bob's Red Mill 10 grains and the molasses for maple sirup ! I cut the recipe in half and baked two of the very best loafs I have ever tasted. This recipe is now one of my favourite on Mac Gourmet.

I am so glad to have found this recipe! We love whole wheat bread and love the easiness of this recipe. This same loaf at our local health food store costs $3.99, and $4.50, for the cranberry/walnut version. I made this recipe as is at first and all of my friends now ask for a loaf every week. Now the only changes I make are to add 1/2 cup millet and use only 2 cups white flour and 2 more cups whole wheat flour. I use the Golden 86 wheat and grind it myself. I also use the basic bread recipe and add dried cranberries and instead of the seeds I use all walnuts for a breakfast bread or a bread to use with chicken or turkey sandwiches. A tip for those of you who need to make a lot of bread all at once is to use juice cans(pineapple/tomato etc.) instead of bread pans. I can fit twelve of those in my regular size oven. Yes, the bread is round, but it is just as tasty! Thank you Dee Dee, for making our home smell wonderful every week and giving my family a healthy and less expensive way to enjoy fresh bread.

This is a great recipe.  I cut the loaves in thin slices because it is a very filling bread.  I would just like to know what is the appoximate content in grams of fiber and protein per slice or for the whole recipe so I can do the math.  Anyone can help with that? I like to eat no less than 4 grams of each protein and fiber per slice so I'm hoping this bread fits that need.

This bread is really good!  I changed the servings to 20 as others have suggested and it yielded 1 regular sized loaf and 4 rolls.  I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. I kneaded the dough for 20 minutes and it rose very nicely on top of a warm stove.  I think different combinations of seeds and nuts would work just as well too.  I will make this again!

A really good recipe, that wasn't difficult at all.  I had no sunflower seeds, or cracked wheat, so I used double the flax and some poppy seeds.  It was good, and I'm sure it will be better when I make it with the ingredients that it called for.  I cut the recipe in half and it turned out fine.

Bread is awesome. I did subsititute olive oil for veg oil, oatmeal for cracked wheat, ground flax seed for flax seeds, and needed to subtract 1 1/2 cups of bread flour and add 1/2 cup of water. I'm not sure how the author got so much flour in it, but it was falling apart for me after the 10th cup of flour. I was able to get 5 good loaves of bread with this recipe and it certainally is a keeper!

I have made this bread several times now. I added wheat germ and sesame seeds and everyone loved it!  We use the rapid rise yeast and it works out great.  I let it rise once and put it in loaves to bake. Mom suggested I put a damp towel over the loaves to let them rise and it turned out great.

This bread is amazing! The best bread me and my wife have ever made! Will definitely be making more. We had no cracked wheat, so we substituted it with chia seeds. Very good!

Delicious.  I couldn't find cracked wheat so I used a bit more of the sunflower and flax seeds and it worked out great.  I did have to add quite a bit more flour (I used all-purpose flour) when kneading the dough to get it to be less sticky.

This is a great recipe. I ground the flax and sunflower seeds since one of my children doesn't like "bits". I also used the food processer to knead. Mine is fairly small so I had to divide the dough into three parts. Each one got 30 seconds in the processor and a bit of extra flour to stop the sticking to the sides of the drum. I cooked half the batch as rolls (cut time to 20 minutes) and the rest as loafs.

This is a great recipe.  I made a few changes using ingredients I had on hand.  I used Spelt flour instead of wheat flour, I used oatmeal and grounded it instead of cracked wheat and organic hard wheat instead of bread flour.  I did have to add extra flour.  I also had to divide the recipe in half.  I made the full recipe just in 2 bowls and used my loaf pans yielding 4 loaves, the extra flour then equaled 1 cu in each bowl.  It tasted great and I have made twice now.  Just a caution using the spelt your dough will be moister you will have to kneed in flour to so it isn't so sticky.  Also roll the dough in flour before putting in your bowl to rise.  Enjoy

Finally a bread that's not only healthy but also tastes great! I used a tablespoon of sesame seeds instead of cracked wheat. Adjusted the recipe to 20 servings and set bread machine to 1.5 lb loaf. Will definitely make again

Really good! I reduced the recipe to a third (24 servings), used only whole wheat and also used oats instead of flax. I didn't have time for all the separate rising stages, so I just mixed the first ingredients and let it rest 10 min, then added the salt and flour, kneaded it for 10 min, and shaped into a long loaf. I placed it on a cookie sheet dusted w/ cornmeal, sliced the top a few times (for looks), covered it, and let it rise in the oven with the light on for 1 hr. Then baked as directed! I also brushed the top with egg whites during the last 10 min of baking. I rated only 4 stars because we all felt the sunflower seed taste was a bit overpowering. Next time I will replace the seeds w/ more cracked wheat or oats and replace the molasses w/ honey. Overall, nice hearty, crusty whole grain bread. Great w/ soup! Thanks Dee!

Delicious bread!  I know you are supposed to rate a recipe making it exactly as written, but I'm not doing that.  Since my husband can't eat seeds and because I didn't have cracked wheat, I subbed those with rolled oats.  My flax was meal rather than seed.  I used white whole wheat flour rather than the bread flour and so added one tablespoon of vital wheat gluten.  One half the recipe made one 9x5 loaf and one smaller one.  This makes very yummy toast for our breakfast.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Delicious! Used oat bran hot cereal instead of the cracked wheat. Skipped all the 20 minute rests and step 5 totally.  Bread turned out awesome and it saved some time not doing these extra steps. Oh, and I did add about 1T whole wheat gluten.

When you think about health breads, you normally think dark and heavy. This one isn't. It's light with a great wholesome nutty flavour. Unlike many homemade breads, it keeps for ages too! This is my family's favourite bread.

Very tender and yummy for a WW bread.  Here are the changes I made to the recipe.  I proofed the yeast (used equal amount of instant)then added the other wet ingredients.  I used VOCO instead of vegetable oil, cider vinegar instead of lemon juice and blackstrap molasses instead of regular.  Added the dry ingredients (minus the last 2 cups of flour) plus 1/2C of vital Wheat gluten and 2 heaping Tbs of dough enhancer.  I used all WW flour except the last 1-2 cups of bread flour that I added until the dough held together well.

I will certainly be making this again and again.  Thanks!!

This is a pretty good bread recipe. I blended different flours together and subsituted rolled oats and barley for the nuts. I substitued hazelnut oil for vegetable oil for more flavor. It is a really flavorful and slightly sweet bread.

I just pulled some of this bread out of the oven and did it ever turn out great.  I didn't have cracked wheat, but used chunked up cashews, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and flax seeds.  I halved the recipe and made two large loaves.  My mother was a baker and I have baked alot of bread in my time.  This is an easy and great recipe in my opinon and I can't wait to bake it again.

I initially cut the recipe to 24 servings for a 2lb loaf in the bread machine; it almost overflowed the pan.  So I took a previous suggestion and reduced the recipe to 20 servings for a 1.5 lb loaf.  I found that if I left out the egg and added about a tablespoon of gluten, the bread had a softer texture.  I also use 1T each cracked wheat, flax and sunflower seeds. Great recipe.

This bread is absolutely excellent -- my family loved it!  I modified it slightly to make it with sourdough and to make only two loaves (it is a HUGE recipe).  The sourdough made an outstanding recipe even better.

My family loves this bread, it's my go-to healthy recipe.  I generally cut the recipe in half to only make 3 loaves, and it always works out.  In the past I have forgotten to add the molasses and it was still delicious.  I always make it in my Kitchenaid stand mixer.  I can never find cracked wheat, so I just use 100% natural wheat bran (not the cereal).  I also just use all-purpose flour, not bread flour.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  A great breakfast bread with honey or sugar and cinnamon.   I look forward to experimenting with future loaves by adding dried fruits and nuts. The bread remains soft and fresh right down to the last slice.  I did not have cracked wheat and substituted wheat germ with perfect results.  If there were 10 stars this recipe certainly would qualify!

I really like this bread. I never have sunflower seeds so I just double the amount of cracked wheat. I also usually add about a half tablespoon more of yeast, as I just like a yeasty bread. I also substitute EVOO for vegetable oil and it turns out just fine. This bread has a really great flavor, and is fun and easy to make.

Not the best taste.  I halved this recipe to 36 and got 2 loaves. I had hoped it would have great flavor looking at the ingredients, but it's pretty bland.  Turned out nice in that they rose nice, they are moist, not a brick of wheat bread as some can be, pretty loaves but flavor is lacking.  Maybe another tbsp of honey?  I don't know, it's missing something, may experiment one more time.

My first homemade bread (with yeast) - great! I have a few kinks of my own to work out, but the recipe has lots of wiggle room for additions and flavouring, my boyfriend ate an entire loaf out of the oven.

I am new to bread-making and this is the first time that I've had success with a yeast wheat bread! I substituted bulgar for the cracked wheat because I couldn't find it in the store. I scaled the recipe back to 40 servings and made one loaf by hand and the other in my bread machine. Both turned out lovely soft loaves with excellent chewy crusts. This is now my go-to bread recipe as it is perfect for breakfast toast and sandwiches. Will be making again and again.

This is an easy yet healthy bread.  Following the suggestion of Callie and since I did not have cracked wheat, I used seasame seeds and oatmeal with the flax.  With no bread machine, followed the suggestions of Sarah Jo by proofing with the warm water (will use half milk next time) and sugar before adding the wet and then dry ingredients and mixing with the paddle attachment of my KitchenAid.  Then kneaded with the dough hook.  Baked at 350 instead of 375, which was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

So good! I followed Sarah Jo's steps and did it all in one bowl in the KitchenAid using half the recipe and made two loaves.  For the "extras" I use the cracked wheat, flax meal, oat bran plus 1/4 cup soy flour. The dough was still pretty wet but  manageable and I like dough moister so left it that way. It doubled perfectly in 60 minutes, formed in two loaf pans, rested 20 minutes, then baked at 350 for 25 minutes. It rose a ton and one loaf split open (lack of loaf forming technique probably) but settled down during the cooling time. This bread has perfect texture & crumb plus great flavor and I like the little crunch the cracked wheat gives. I imagine the seeds would be even better but I have a lot of other stuff that needs to be used up for now.  This one is my new staple recipe.

This may be one of my favs!  To make healthier I used all whole wheat flour, substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil, and used Agave in place of sugar. Made a batch scaled to 18 in my bread machine on light crust & basic wheat setting.

This was good but I was a little disappointed after having read all the good reviews. I made the recipe exactly as indicated, except for the following: I cut it in half to make two loaves and one pan of rolls; I added a couple of tablespoons of gluten; and I had to sub oatmeal for the cracked wheat. I was unable to knead in almost a whole cup of flour (would've been two cups on the unhalved recipe); the dough was saturated and I didn't think it could take any more. All the resting seemed a little excessive, since it isn't usually required in the other bread recipes I make. (I'm no expert, but neither is this my first time making bread.) Anyway, the loaves were small and puny for the loaf pans, not even filling them, and were nothing like the pic. Overall, the bread was quite wheaty, but pretty good and suitable for sandwiches, as I had hoped. But it wasn't just so delicious that I'd gobble it up by itself.

This is delicious- so light and fluffy! I used all whole wheat flour (no white), apple sauce instead of oil (I always do this when baking), and oatmeal because I didn't have cracked wheat. Delicious!

Excellent recipe, thanks!  Like another reviewer I used apple cider vinegar in place of the lemon juice, turned out great.  Also, thanks to the Mom of 6 who mentioned she puts her dough in the oven for raising and leaves it in there while the oven preheats as well.  I tried both, preheating the oven before sticking it in to bake & with it in during preheat.  The one that stayed in the oven while preheating was fantastic!

Thank you Dee for this recipe!!!! Very good bread. I left out the lemon juice-never had that in a bread recipe before and I didn't see the purpose...I'm curious if anyone knows.  I halved the recipe and made three nice loaves. It's a dense loaf, filling.  I kept the molasses at 1/4 cup. I added millet, oatmeal, sesame seeds and flax. I didn't have the cracked wheat or sunflower seeds.  As others have said, this is a versatile bread. You can mix up the seed and nuts as you like.   I shaped my loaves and baked them on preheated clay tiles. The dough held it's shape nicely as it rose in the oven. I will be using this one again and again.

Love this! Thanks. I made half the recipe. Didn't have cracked wheat so substituted 1/2 C from the whole wheat flour for multi grain bread flour instead. Amazing!

I've been making bread for about 6 months now with a very basic whole wheat recipe.  I wanted more of a multi-grain bread and Dee's looked impressive, yet simple.  I used 8 cups (instead of 7) of WW flour only because my daughter ground up too much, so I reduced white flour to 3 cups (instead of 4). I didn't have cracked wheat so I used oats instead. I also ground up the flax seed and used olive oil as others suggested. I put into 3 (9x5) loaf pans. It rose beautifully and tasted awesome the first time. I also skipped all the rests. Thank you so much, Dee.  I have 4 girls who love to eat bread and making 3 loaves at once is wonderful and saves this mom some time in the kitchen.

This is what I've been looking for! Absolutely wonderful in taste, ease of preparation and in handling/working with the dough.  I used oatmeal instead of cracked wheat, but kept everything else the same.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe!  This will surely be placed in my list of top 5 bread recipes.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Like some other reviewers, I didn't do all the rising stages.  Mixed all the ingredients with my KitchenAid Mixer, let rise for an hour, punched down and let rise another 30 minutes.  Came out very nice!  Next time, I might let it rise for longer the second time (to see if it the bread gets fluffier).  Also, if you scale the recipe down to 24, it makes a 9X5 bread loaf.

I have very little experience with yeast breads and half expected this not to come out on my first try, but it did come out beautifully. It's time-consuming but not especially difficult to make. I enjoyed making it and my husband and I are enjoying eating it. It's delicious and nice to bake something I can eat 100% guilt-free for a change.

My most successful bread-making experience yet . . . deliciously crispy crust but soft and chewy on the inside.  I took some to my class and now everyone loves me.  I added 2 T. wheat germ along with the other grains, substituting cooked whole wheat and oats for cracked wheat--it worked well.  During kneading, the dough was quite sticky so I kept adding flour (up to 1-1/2 cups more than called for)--not sure if that was the right thing to do, but the bread still came out wonderfully!  Thanks for all your work on this great recipe.  Definitely worth the time.

This bread was really good and quite simple to make!  I accidently used all whole wheat flour and it was still very very good - maybe didn't rise as much as it should have because of this but still did rise quite a bit.

I halved the recipe and made 2 full sized loaves and 4 mini loaves.

WOW!! This bread is great!  I just started making bread a few weeks ago and this one is easy and great tasting.  I scaled the recipe down to 18 servings and as recommended by another reviewer, I used only whole wheat flour and added 1T of wheat gluten.  Additionally I used organic coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil and only used egg whites instead of the whole egg.  The resulting bread is soft, fluffy and tastes great.  I plan on continuing to make this bread as my staple one instead of buying from the store.  Thanks much Dee!

This is really good and flavourful bread! I have a bread machine, but (when I have the time) like to make bread by hand...and this recipe was a good choice. It is moist, slightly sweet and so soft on the inside! I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made 3 loaves. I only have one loaf pan, so I made 2 into french bread-style loaves. Turned out great!!

I'm giving this 5 stars.  It turned out really well, and was good.

BUT, what it really did for me is finally resolve what I was doing wrong when making wheat bread.  I only make whole grain, wheat recipes.  I have a favorite recipe which is GREAT in flavor, but I couldn't get the texture right. It's all in the PROCESS.  THANK YOU, Thank You, thank you!!

This is great bread. In order to keep the six loaves fresh, it is necessary to tightly wrap and freeze the extras. It does not stay moist and fresh tasting very long. The flavor is excellent.

This is a wonderful bread recipe. My bread of choice has been the Country Seed Bread from this site. It holds up great for sandwiches. Now this recipe is gaining. Its tasty dense texture is absolutely perfect for the chicken salad and tuna salad sandwiches that my family craves for lunch. Thanks Dee Dee.

This bread is delicious - especially toasted!!
I made it in my bread-making machine so it was also super easy.(I cut the servings size down to 22)
I threw all the dry ingredients in, added the wet ingredients, closed the lid, pushed the button and 5 hours later I had a great loaf of bread! Great crust and a hearty, but not heavy, texture.
I made a few changes:
All whole wheat flour,
Added 1 Tbs gluten
Bobs 10 grain cereal instead of the cracked wheat (didn't have any)
Added a little whole grain quinoa
I'm going to be making this bread often. 
I usually make up batches of the dry ingredients and this recipe is going to allow me to make many variations.
Thanks Dee for a great recipe and thanks everyone else for all the great suggestions!!

I used cornmeal instead of cracked wheat because that is what I had on hand and I baked the loaves in my French bread pans. Yummy!

This was excellent. I scaled it down to 24 servings and it made 2 loaves - not huge loaves but just the right size for my DH and self.  (I used just 1 egg for the two loaves.)  Two loaves is about right for the week so I will be making this frequently from now on. I did buy some 5 grain cereal to add to it this next time. We both felt it needed more whole grains. I did add some whole flax seed, quinoa, oats, sesame, and sunflower seeds the first time around. Also, per another reviewers suggestion, I did soak those grains in a bit of water while I was mixing things up. Just enough water to cover the grains.  So use whatever grains you have handy. This is a super easy recipe and very, very tasty!  Makes great toast and even garlic bread for those Italian meals. Thank you!

Oh. My. Gosh. This bread RULES!!! All I did was take out the salt and it helps it rise a bit. Not against salt, just forgot to put it in the first time (woops) and realized I didn't need it! Also, I made it in 2 loaf pans. Wait til you try it toasted! WOW! I also added lots more flax seeds (about another 1/8 cup, wheat bran, irish oats, barley, wheat berries (both unsoaked!) and used only wheat flour. This bread is absolutely unbelievable! THANK YOU DEE!!!!!

I've been making bread for quite a few years now and have tried many different recipes but this is by far the best whole wheat bread recipe ever.  Makes a delicious soft bread.  Also made it into rolls for kids lunches.

My family LOVED this bread!!!  I made 2 batches with only a few modifications (additonal seeds, only whole wheat flour, egg beaters) and they were a hit.  Then I made a batch with walnuts, dried cranberrys and orange zest..... my family went wild and I am stuck making another batch this weekend....

I love this recipe! It's pretty much the only bread recipe I use.. I do play around with the grains though (The cracked wheat, sunflower seeds and flax) Sometimes I put an 1/8 of those and then add 1/8 cup of hemp hearts, oats, and pumpkin seeds.  I also love topping the bread with rosemerry and a little grated cheese..YUm!

WOW!!! AMAZING!!!  I have never made a whole wheat bread that turned out this light & fluffy!  It is literally so fluffy it's like store bought; hard to spread peanut butter on it without tearing it...even hard to slice it without squishing it!  I don't want those to sound like bad things--this bread turned out PERFECT!!!  I wanted to make it exactly as instructed in the recipe despite my tendency to change things...I wanted to know how it was SUPPOSED to turn out before changing it.  I've experimented with a lot of bread recipes-I make bread regularly & barely ever buy at the store anymore.  This one is what I've been looking for!  As one reviewer stated, I believe that it is the PROCESS in this recipe that makes a difference.  Many of my WW recipes are half bread flour/half WW because despite my desire to use all WW I cannot get a light enough loaf that my family will eat.  The proportion of WW to bread (white) flour in this recipe is already a lot more that what I'm used to, & it is sooo fluffy!    I am definitely going to use all WW next time & see how it turns out.  Even though the processes make this recipe a little longer to make, it is not more difficult, & I think it is worth it!  The only changes I did make were to add a dry 9 grain cereal (whole grains) instead of cracked wheat b/c I didn't have the cracked wheat, & I added 2 Tbsp. of vital wheat gluten.  MARVELOUS!  I did leave the bread in the oven when I turned it on to preheat-didn't hurt it.  It made 5 loaves.

Great recipe!!  I reduced the number of servings to 24 and that was enough to make one very large loaf.  I will be making this again and again, adding nuts and dried fruit, and reducing the bread flour to make it a little less soft for easier for slicing.

This was my very first attempt, ever, at baking bread. I halved the recipe because I didn't want to screw up a WHOLE batch. Because of the distraction of two small children things were risen longer than stated and kneaded less time than stated but the end result, while not high and fluffy like store bought breads is pretty darn good!! I will definately make this again and add more seeds, we love seedy breads.

Fool proof and completely adjustable. I was baking with a 3 year old "helping" me and got distracted enough to forget the oil, egg and lemon juice...still turned out great. I cut the recipe in half and did two loaves and one pan of 12 rolls(8x8). I baked the rolls for 5 minutes less. Yum, yum.

This bread is wonderful, I make it all the time.  The only change I make is flax seed for the wheat germ, but that's only because for some reason I'm having trouble finding it.  This recipe has replaced the store bought bread we bought for years!

It was soft but bland.  Mine didn't look as delicious as the photo.  

Changes:  maple syrup instead of molasses, oatmeal, burgul, sesame seeds instead of flax seed, cracked wheat, sunflower seeds.  Added 1 tbsp flaxseed meal.  Do NOT coat the pan with cornmeal, it tastes gross.

Next time will try reviewer suggestion:  using NO white flour, using instant yeast, adding 2 tbsp each of dough enhancer, lecithin, and vital wheat gluten. I will try not doing the rising, just mixing all at once, kneading, put in loaf pans to rise, then put in oven and bake even while oven is preheating.

This is some of the best bread I have ever made.  To get more nutrition from the bread, I grind the flaxseeds.  This bread is great for making calzones as well.  I just cut in half the dough for one loaf of bread and that yields two good size calzones.  
I am having a hard time getting the bread to look like the picture.  I'll keep trying.

Outstanding taste and texture!  I love the fact that this is one of the "whole-wheatiest" of the wheat bread recipes on the site.  I ended up with one large loaf (very much sandwich-sized) and about 18 hamburgersized rolls.  I know I will use this recipe again and again.  Bravo, Dee!

Great recipe!  Love how it came out and sliced well.  The people who are saying it is bland possibly are use to salt in bread. I suggest adding 1 tablespoon of salt. I like that there is no salt in it, just healthy ingredients! Thank you for sharing.

This bread is soft and has a great flavor. My whole family liked it. 

The recipe is a lot larger than I expected - six loaves. I used a mixer and had to split It when no more flour would fit. I used the opportunity to mix in some dried cranberries into half of it.

I used all whole wheat flour due to dietary restrictions and it worked fine. 

I am very new to baking - this is the second time I have made bread. The recipe was much less complicated than it appears and it turned out well. 

I would recommend this recipe, even for beginners, but suggest that you cut the recipe in half.

I make this bread for our family every week. I am not able to buy molasses locally so substitute extra dark honey or demerara sugar. I sometimes use a blend of different flours (local whole wheat, stoned ground whole wheat) and mix of seeds/oats for crunch.

I've made a lot of whole grain breads in my time, and this is one of the best. Considering the ratio of whole grain to white, it is surprisingly light. I don't know if it's the ingredients (the eggs and lemon juice are unusual) or the rising method, but this one works! Notes: I made this into four loaves; 6 would have made very small loaves. Also, I could not incorporate as much flour as the recipe called for.

Even though I ended up splitting it and kneading half by hand and half in my Kitchen Aid, it turned out light and rose beautifully.  I couldn't find cracked wheat and substituted wheat germ and also used all purpose flour instead of bread flour.  I didn't have six loaf pans so I made four loaves and they turned out fine.  I will most likely half the recipe from now on, but I'll definitely make it again!

Very good but even cutting the recipe in half it almost was to much for my kitchen aid to knead.

This is the best bread I've ever made! I cut the recipe in half and made two huge loaves. I also didn't have cracked wheat, flax seed or sunflower seeds so I used flax meal, oatmeal, sesame seeds and ground up a pecan and almond mix and added that as well. As I was putting them in the oven to bake, I sprinkled a small amount of the nut mixture on top... I did bake it most of the time with aluminum foil on the top so the nuts didn't burn. They turned out toasted and super tasty. It turned out light and fluffy but really sturdy. Mr. Cinnamon loved this bread and ate almost half a loaf with dinner. I will be making this over and over! Thanks for the perfect recipe! **Edit - Didn't mention that I used brown rice syrup in place of the molasses.

Loved this bread! Great flavor and texture.  I love melted butter on top so it doesn't dry out.  My oven is 25 degrees warmer so I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe makes two beautiful loaves of bread. I took someone else's suggestion to just let it rise once in the bread pans.  I changed the balance of wheat to white flour....added more wheat/less white.  To assure good rising I added some vital wheat gluten.    I will be making this again

This was my first time ever baking bread, and it came out great! I scaled it down to 12 servings for 1 loaf a little on the small side. I didn't have all the add-ins, so it put in oatmeal, millet and quinoa. Came out much better than I expected!

My new favorite bread recipe. I used flax seed, walnuts, and wheat bran because I didn't have cracked wheat or sunflower seeds. Wonderful texture from the nuts and seeds, but still surprisingly light!

Overall I like this recipe a lot and use it often.  I occasionally have trouble with the bread falling when it first begins to bake.  Haven't figured out what I'm doing wrong.

Very nice.  I like being able to find a recipe that has whole grains in it.  I didn't have flax seed, just flaxseed meal, so I put that in instead.  I also didn't have cracked wheat, so I subbed oats.  Although I don't usually have a problem with breads baking within the recommended time in my oven, this bread needed another 10 minutes for it to be done.

My first ever attempt to make homemade bread- and this was the absolute best! It was easy and tasted great! It made 4 loaves I froze some dough- two loafs and we are eating one instead of the bread we bought at the store.

The bread had a very nice texture. It was light and chewy. But neither my wife nor I cared too much for the flavor by its self. However it was really good for sandwiches.
