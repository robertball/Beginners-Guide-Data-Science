I finished this off with a sprinkle of feta cheese. I also included minced garlic with the onions, and enhanced the broth and juice mixture with white wine. I also added a couple of drops each of wild orange and rosemary essential oils. I think this recipe is going to find its way to my thanksgiving or Christmas table this year. It would be a great leftover dish if you stir in some turkey to make it a main dish

I made this dish just as the recipe states, no changes.  It was wonderful!  The sweetness of the roasted butternut squash and the tartness of the dried cranberries was so delicious!  I will be making this again!

If you want to punch up the orange flavor, add the zest of an orange right at the end. Enjoy.

I used normal instant rice and not as much onion. :)

I really enjoyed this risotto.  It is exceptionally easy (especially when you are lazy like I was and buy the pre-cubed squash).  Putting the rosemary in the broth/OJ mixture created a lovely flavor that is not overpowering.  I did opt to zest an orange and stir it in at the end to enhance the orange flavor.  I didn't have pecans so I toasted walnuts, it worked just fine.  Otherwise, everything was exactly as directed and delicious.  I served this with the "Beer Butt Rosemary Chicken" also found on this site omitting the potatoes from that recipe - great meal with a veggie and green salad.

A delicious recipe!  I substituted dried apricots for cranberries because thatâ€™s what I had on hand and added a little bit of chopped bacon as another reviewer suggested.  I will definitely make this again.

SOOO good! I woke my wife up from a nap with a spoon full of it in her face!  I warm it by cooking some bacon, and add the rice in after its done.  Very good.

Time-intensive, as risotto always is, but a delicious side dish!

Very good. We added a bit of chicken and a touch of cream and called it a main dish. It was enjoyed by all, even the kids.

Wow.  Delicious.  I followed the recipe except for adding quartered brussel sprouts which I roasted alongside the squash.  Next time I plan to add ribbons of kale to the rice mixture towards the end.  Trying to increase the veggie to rice ratio.  Definitely will cook again.  Great to cook ahead and put in warming drawer to eat later.

This is amazing.   I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have the spring of thyme so I put in the dried thyme  but regretted it because I had to pick it all out with a slotted spoon after I had boiled the broth.  Next time will use a metal tea infuser.  Really really delicious!
