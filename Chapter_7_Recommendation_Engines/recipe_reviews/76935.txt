I've cooked this twice. First time, I prepared it and then put it in the refrigerator for 3 hours and cooked it after dinner. Second time, I cooked it straight away. It was definitely better the first time (more dense and chocolatey). The second time was too fluffy and dry. I'm guessing the reason was that the eggs had some time to deflate. Next time, I will make it in advance again. 

Thanks for the great recipe!

Hubby and I travel frequently, several times a month, which means we eat out frequently as well. We've both had our share of Molten Lava Cakes in fine restaurants all over the country. And so you understand the significance then, when hubby said these were as fine as we've had anywhere. But you do get out of these what you put into them, so use good quality chocolate, not chocolate chips--I used Scharffen Berger. Chocolatey rich and delicious, perfectly moist and cakey on the outside, gooey and "molten" on the inside.  I made these in 6 oz. buttered ramekins and served with homemade raspberry sauce.  A definite make again.  BIG pay off for very little effort!

This is, hands down, my favorite dessert. A.k.a. chocolate lava cakes, they can be served with raspberry liqueur drizzled on the plate with a mint garnish or topped with whipped cream.

I've put the batter in the freezer and have been able to store for several weeks. (Baking time is increased to 12-15 minutes.)

I recommend:

1) replacing the paper muffin cups in muffin pan with ramekins sprayed with oil or cooking spray. (You can turn them over on plate for presentation.)

2) using Ghirardelli or another high quality chocolate

Oh boy.  These got RAVE reviews, and mine were even under-done.  And sooo easy.
My batter was a bit cool still when I popped them in, and it took a good 14 minutes at least.  
Here's a tip: when the top pops up and starts to crack they are perfect.  The inside is still molten and that cracked gooey part will fall back in.
My sugar coated raspberries were not the prettiest...but they tasted great.
Definitely make these again and again and again...

I too made these for Valentine's Day dinner & man, they were good! And easy!!! I cooked 4 in ramekins & 4 in muffin cups minus the papers. I sprayed both ramekins & muffin cups w/ Baker's Joy first & both came out cleanly when warm. (I did not immediately remove 2 of the ramekins & even though I microwaved each for 20 seconds they still fell apart when removed. So be sure & remove these while warm, even if you don't eat them right away.) I pooled a bit of raspberry liqueur on the plate before adding the cake & then topped w/ the sugared raspberries. Will have this again many times!

Unbelievable dessert!!! It was so easy to make and ohhhh soooo good to eat.  I make at least once a week (requested by my husband).  No need to change anything in this recipe (although I have added instant coffee to the chocolate chips and butter for a deeper flavor).  To reheat any that are left over just put in the microwave for approx 25 seconds- it's like taking them out of the oven for the first time (they're also just as good cold-fudgelike).  Five stars just doesn't do this recipe justice.

This is a phenomenal recipe. I have used this one twice and it has been a HUGE hit both times. I used Giardenelli (sp) bittersweet chocolate to make it even more wonderful. Defintely make batter in advance and let set in refrigerator several hours before using. You do not need to let it warm up to room temperature. I used raspberry perserves for an easy delicious topping.

Yum, these are delish.  I never bother with the double boiler.  I just microwave the butter and chocolate together and this goes together so quickly.  I also just serve them with heavy cream poured straight over.  Very rich and delicious.

Perfect as written and so easy to make. Can be baked ahead and microwaved before serving. I have made this many times and like it best served with whipped cream and fresh raspberries. I use custard cups sprayed with pam and have never had problems getting them out. This can be frozen.

WOW - this recipe is fantastic! I took the advise of another person and prepared in ramekins which made for a great presentation. I also added blueberries, strawberries and blackberries to the fruit mixture.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, this is a gourmet treat!

here's another tip for this recipe, you can make these ahead of time and freeze them, in the muffin tins with the paper liners, once frozen cover with plastic. Bake when you want, as many as you want, just increase the bake time to 14 minutes. You can go from frozen to molten in only 14 minutes!

Rating is NOT based upon the recipe given, but is based on the following changes.  I made the cakes twice, once following the recipe as given, and the second time making some changes.  I believe the second time was the five star quality.
First off...to use all semi-sweet chocolate is not going to impart the rich quality one would expect, so I split it into a combo of semi-sweet chocolate(2oz) and bitter sweet chocolate (6oz)  Next instead of using regular granualated sugar, I changed it to confectioner sugar and bumped it to 1 1/2 cups -which also made up for the quantity of bittersweet chocolate used -the confectioner sugar gives a finer texture, and is not grainy.  I also bumped the butter up to 1 1/4 cups - I also increased the flour from 2 Tbsp (1/8 cup) to 1/4 cup.  I changed the quanity of eggs also, using 3 whole eggs, and then using 3 egg yolks, and to give it some added flavour, I added in 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract, and 2 Tbsp grand marnier.  I baked it at 425 minutes for 14 minutes.

All I had to do was melt the butter, and chocolate, and then mix in the remaining ingredients and pour into 6 well greased oven-safe custard cups

Used this recipe for a great finish to a dinner party and it was a big HIT! I did use ramekins and filled them 3/4 of the way - which increases the baking time by about 5 minutes. This recipe will fill 6 ramekins. I also added a teaspoon of instant coffee and a teaspoon of cocoa powder to the chocolate mixture. These additions will deepen & enhance the chocolate flavor. I put the ramekins on a sheet pan and baked them as we started dinner and when it was time for  dessert - they were done and had cooled just enough to add fresh berries and serve. This dessert is a winner in many ways - you can (& should) make the batter ahead of time -fill your ramekins and store in fridge, it is an easy recipe to follow and great results. A WIN / WIN situation! 2 thumbs up!

These are fantastic and so easy to make.  I used the Reynolds disposable foil mini tins in the shape of stars and it made for a very nice presentation.

Awesome.. Just make sure to keep an eye on cooking time.  The first time I overcooked them and they weren't fudgy in the middle.  The next time I did exactly 8mins and they were perfect

These were amazing! So so so easy, too, which makes everything taste better, I think! :) Be sure not to cook them for too long- I baked them for 8 and a half minutes and they were a little less "molten" than I would have liked, but on the whole, they were amazing! The best strategy is to keep an eye on them! My family also loved them, but didn't think they'd be as great without the vanilla ice cream I served with them.  Also, a flavorful hint: top each cake with a scoop of quality vanilla ice cream and a tiny sprinkling of cinnamon. It's delish! The cinnamon is not too overpowering but adds a whole new dimension of taste! Thanks for this!

This makes 6 ramekin sized cakes. Spray ramekins with cooking spray and coated with sugar, used 1/2 semi sweet 1/2 bittersweet chocolate (using all semi sweet makes it too sweet and all bittersweet is too rich), melted with the butter in a micro safe bowl starting with 1 min at a time on high until melted.  needed to bake 14-18 mins (8-10 mins was not enough time) looking for the top to pop up and start to crack then it's ready.  Tip: make sure to mix the sugar and eggs well to fully dissolve the sugar or it will be slightly grainy. This is a super easy dessert to make.

If you are expecting an actual "cake" forget this recipe.  Notice that it only takes 4 tsp of flour?!  What a disappointment.  This was more like an over-coagulated chocolate type pudding. I wish the description had been more accurate.  Not only was I disappointed, but it tasted strange.  Maybe because I expected cake?  I'll never make this again!

i made these for company we had over last night and today my husband asked me to make them again for him because he loved them so much! i used aluminum baking cups (without the paper liners) and placed them on a cookie sheet. i also made a homemade raspberry sauce using 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries (slightly defrosted) 2 tbsp sugar and a tbsp or two of water in a mini food processor. i spooned the raspberry sauce onto a plate and then placed the cakes on top. so yummy! i definitely will make these again real soon!

There is a well-known store that sells a mix for molten cake for $24.  This recipe tops that mix!  Very easy, and super good.

This was divine!!!  I cut the recipe down to make only 2 servings, which worked fine.  I also didn't have any raspberries on hand, so I placed a dollop of raspberry preserves on top of the cake and dusted it with powdered sugar.  It looked awesome and tasted better.  A perfect rendition of something I'd expect from a great restaurant!

pure chocolate bliss! i love how simple this recipe is to put together and wonderfully it turns out. it's all about the chocolate, so definitely use ghirardelli or something similar. i bake these in ramekins, turn out onto plates and serve w/ whipped cream and berries. they reheat well in the microwave, too.

This is SUCH a great dessert: easy, can be frozen for later use, DELICIOUS, & elegant. What more could you want?! I made the batter & ended up having to freeze it for about 3 weeks...I was worried that time would take its toll & the cakes wouldn't turn out alright. I was wrong...they were spectacular. The sort of thing you'd pay $7 for at a fine restaurant. Make this, freeze it, thaw it out a bit, pour into some greased ramekins, bake for about 12 minutes, and ENJOY (with some raspberries or raspberry sorbet)!

I served these delicious little cakes to guests and they couldn't get enough!  I recommend beating the egg mixture for a few extra minutes after the sugar is dissolved - this incorporates lots of air and ensures a nice smooth texture when adding to the chocolate mixture.

These are simple and the ultimate crowd pleaser. I have used strawberries as the fruit topping as well as raspberries. The raspberries definitely taste better.

This was wonderful!  The taste and texture is very similar to chocolate souffle but much easier to make. Will be using this recipe again for sure.

Am I on a Carnival cruise?  This is JUST LIKE Carnival's Warm Chocolate Melting Cake!  I used Ghiradelli's bittersweet chocolate, skipped the fruit, and refrigerated the batter in ramekins before baking for 9 minutes.  I upended the ramekins onto a cute plate and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  My husband's eyes rolled back in his head at the first bite.  Mine did, too!

These were so good!  I've always wanted to make chocolate lava cakes and never have until now.  The butter amount put me off for a while, but I decided to go for it today.  I only had salted butter on hand so I omitted the salt.  I fit all the batter into 6 ramekins because I didn't want leftover batter and it worked well.  We skipped the raspberries (didn't have) and had vanilla ice cream instead.  The kids were excited about the "lava" and everyone loved them!

Sooooooooo Restaruant Quality!!! And so darn easy.  We especially love that you can make the batter ahead of time. Sit down for a nice dinner with friends and family. Take out the batter and let it sit , then when the urging is there for dessert, pop it in for 10 minutes.  And i do recommend 10 minutes. The muffin holders do OK, it's a pain to get them out without destroying them, even with lots of Nonstick Pam spray.  Next time, we're going to try using Ramekins for better presentation.  One dollup of vanilla bean ice cream and you'll be in heaven.  Perfect compliment of hot to cold and decadent chocolate to the vanilla cream.  Sensational.

This is so delicious!!!!  It's very easy to make and impresses everyone.  My family LOVES this recipe and so does everyone I've made it for. The batter has a delicious flavor and I love the sweetness of the berries.  Anyone can make this...it's almost foolproof!

I serve this as an elegant dessert for banquets. I have never had the pleasure of fresh raspberries, so I add a dollop of whipped cream and frozen raspberries. It's easy, elegant and everyone loves it.

I tried this recipe using semisweet chocolate chips and the cakes were decadent and to die for. All I was missing was a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I baked the cakes in ramekins instead of a muffin pan so right when they were fresh out of the oven, I dug in!! A chocolate lovers dream. Fabulous Recipe! Thanks!

These cakes are very sweet and rich-- a little too rich.  It's kind of like eating hot batter. Tip: Don't stick birthday candles in them; the molten centers melt the wax.

These were absolutely amazing.  I used 4 eggs instead of 5--they were still great and it cut down (the tiniest bit) on unhealthiness--of course, the cakes were so good that the unhealthiness mattered not a jot.  I used frozen raspberries, and the combination of warm cakes with cold raspberries was delicious.  :-)

Wow.  This recipe is fantastic.  My guests absolutely raved, and some had had molten lava cakes in restaurants many times and said they were the best they’d ever had.  

I used 6 oz ramekins, 4 eggs, unsalted butter (but added a ¼ teaspoon of salt), and a pinch of cinnamon.  I made them the day before my dinner party and kept them chilled until about 15 minutes before baking.  They needed 12 minutes to bake.  I used shortening to grease the ramekins so they’d be sure to pop out easily, which they did.  Two that were less done than the others needed to have some of the goo spooned out, but all held their shape nicely.  I skipped the fruit and served them with vanilla ice cream and garnished with a sprig of mint and a sprinkle of shaved chocolate.  Fantastic presentation.  Definitely agree that you have to use quality chocolate for quality results.

For 2 or 1.....  I wanted something quick to make when i was craving chocolate and I've found it!  This was fabulous.  (I used dark chocolate chips)  Here is what I did.  2 1/2 T. salted butter, 1/4 C. choc. chips melted together in the micro.  Added to the choc 1 egg, 1 T. sugar, 1 1/2 tsp flour.  Divided it into 2 glass ramekins, baked at 450 for 9 minutes.  PERFECT!!!

This was pretty good. I had all of the ingredients on hand and in the mood for dessert. I halved the recipe and made 4 cakes in ramekins. The cakes dont rise alot so if you want a larger cake, it will make less servings.  I baked them im my toaster oven at 450 degrees, for 11 minutes. Garnish with powdered sugar and rasperries. I prefer this to the Ghirardelli recipe on this site, and it is much simpler to make as well. I will make this again soon for my boyfriend, and I know he'll love it.

oh wow. soo yummy. i made these for my choco-holic boyfriend's bday last night. i made the batter the night before (added a dash of vanilla and maybe a tsp. of instant coffee granules to enhance chocolate flavor. i also increased the sugar by about a tablespoon as i used VERY dark and slightly bitter chocolate) and poured it into greased, floured standard muffin tins, covered w/foil, & stuck it in the fridge. i cheated and poured one cakes worth into a seperate muffin tin & baked it off the night before just to get the timing/temp right since i wasn't using the extra-large muffin liners. it came out overdone at 8 min/450 degrees. the chocolate almost tasted burnt and the inside was kind of an icky eggy texture. with that in mind, last night i took them out of the fridge for about 30 min just to take a bit of the chill off.. i wanted them to stay cool though so that the inside would take longer to bake to achieve the "molten" texture. i ended up baking them at 425 for about 7 1/2-8 minutes. took them out and immediately popped them out of the tin. i had no problems getting them out by running a paring knife around the perimeter and using a tiny offset spatula to help them out and onto a plate. i served them with barely sweetened whipped cream and fresh raspberries. i didn't bother with the sugar on the berries as the ones i found were already really sweet. long story short, the key is to NOT OVERBAKE these. the texture suffers and they almost become inedible. take them out bef

I just baked this fancy dessert for my parents tonight. I did have a few changes: instead of using a muffin pan, I used greased ramekins (I filled them a little over 3/4ths full.. I made 3 cakes, and froze the rest of the batter), and I added 1/2 teaspoon coco powder. I let them bake for 12 minutes (I might do a little longer next time), and then allowed them to cool for about three minutes before putting them on a plate. What a beautiful dessert.. I garnished with the raspberries, powder sugar, whipped cream, and drizzled chocolate syrup over them. They were very rich, but my dad said they were just as good as the ones we had on a cruise ship (I somewhat disagree.. but they were still good). I rate this a 4.5, and I will be making them again.

These are awesome!  Ive always wanted to make these cakes for company but they always seemed so complicated.  This recipe was super easy.  I followed it exactly, except that I used small muffin cups.  Also, I used the kind of Pam with flour in it and the cakes came right out of the paper cups.  I will definatly be making these again and again!

This cake was wonderful, my husband said it was one of, if not the best, chocolate desert he had ever had.  I thought the flavor was really great.  I used salted better and it turned out fine.  I also added a few teaspoons of cocoa to make it a bit more rich and chocolatey which was a good move. Next time I think I will also use a bit less sugar in the batter and instead grease the pan and sugar it to make a crispy sugar crust for the cakes.

This is a great recipe; very easy, delicious and seems much harder than it is.  I didn't have fruit, so I served the cakes with coffee ice cream and drizzled it with Kahlua.  Wonderful to make for last-minute guests or a sudden chocolate jones.  Definite keeper!!

Why don't we have a 10 star option AR? This is one that is very deserving of 10 stars. My daughter upon turning 18 wanted chocolate for a birthday cake. Well, she got chocolate alright. I took the advice of another reviewer as well as my own common sense and knew that if this was going to be really good, then I needed to use really good ingredients. I used 2 1/2 bars of Lindt sweet dark chocolate instead of the chips. I also used a salted butter and would use it again next time. I think that along with the pinch of additional salt really brings out the flavor of the chocolate. The 5 eggs were at room temp before mixing too. I baked them (8 of them) in greased custard cups @ 450 for 11 minutes. They came out perfect. Also, I did make this batter ahead by about an hour prior to baking. Rather than refrigerate, I did leave it sit out at room temp. The batter settled down and got quite thick. I didn't sugar the raspberries, just served on the side. Dusted the tops with powdered sugar and served with a good quality vanilla bean ice cream. Rich, decadent, and totally sinful......but very memorable.

This is my first attempt at making lava cakes and I will be making them lots more! It was a big hit at my dinner party! They are decadent, delicious and easy to make and serve. They turned out wonderful! I made ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to bake. I sprayed the custard dishes with Pam and they came out very easy. It is just the perfect amount of chocolate! Thank you for a delicious recipe that I will hang onto for years!

This was amazing and super easy! As suggested, I made it in advance and refrigerated it for a few hrs. I followed the recipe exactly, but since I only wanted 4 molten cakes, I halved the recipe (I used 3 medium eggs instead of 2.5 large eggs). I used 120g of lindt chocolate (half milk choc and half 70% dark), and it was absolutely heavenly. It was even better than most fondants I've had at restaurants.

This recipe is definately the best!!!  However, cooking time and using the best chocolate you can find is key.  I used two different kinds of ghiradelli (semi-sweet and 60% cocoa) and they turned out so rich and chocolatey.  I also overbaked mine which is extremely important not to do.  I chilled the batter right up until cooking time, used greased and floured muffin pan that holds 12 (liners not needed, they pop right out) and baked for 8 minutes and they were slightly over cooked.  The texture in the middle becomes quiche-like if they are over cooked.  The top center should still look runny and then they will be perfect.  Next time I'm sure I will get it right and bake for 7 to 7 1/2.  Thanks for this fabulous and EASY recipe!!!

These were absolutely delicious and addicting - I made them twice this weekend. I substituted bittersweet chocolate for the semi-sweet and salted butter for the unsalted, since that's what I had on hand. Make sure to take them out of the oven before the centers are set - they're not nearly as good without the pudding-like filling!

Very tasty, and super easy and quick to make!  I had a dinner party to go to tonight, and only around 15 minutes to whip something together, and this was perfect.  I didn't have any raspberries, so sifted some powdered sugar on top.  Thank you!

Excellent results.  Looks like a restaurant dessert.  Got rave reviews from friends.  One tip a friend of mine gave me (he's a chef.  Place batter into molds and leave in the freezer for about an hour before baking.  The results are definitely worth it.

Very delicious, elegant and simple. I baked these decadent little cakes in individual ramekins on a baking sheet. It took about 9 minutes to bake. I baked 4 last night and plan to bake the rest tonight. Served with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream. Thank you for the recipe!

I made these for a party I catered.  Doubled the recipe and used regular sized cupcake wraps - that made 27 cakes.  I made them in advance - chilled well and then into the freezer.  They were transported frozen.  Ten minutes in a 450 oven was perfect.  I topped with cherry pie filling with the glaze being the lava.  Perfect and impressive dessert that brought rave reviews.  Thank you.

Wow, to die for. I put in some white chocolate in the center & the other half some milk chocolate. So, so chocolatey. I baked mine 10 mins. Next time, i will put some raspberry preserves in the center. Thank you!

AMAZING. Make these. Be sure to not over cook them, I usually take them out around 7-8 minutes to ensure I don't burn them... if you do, they're ruined. These refrigerate pretty well also, weirdly... you won't get the hot lava effect but its more like a mousse center - awesome. I skipped the raspberry and flour, just cause I'm a straight up chocolate chick.

I would give this stuff more stars if i could! I've been making this for so long now, and tonight i'm making this with bittersweet chocolate sauce and creme anglaise. for the people who think its too "spongy" try pushing in a hershey kiss (not chocolate chips) in the center to make it more "molten". CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!

This dessert was AMAZING. I did make it 4 hours before and left it in the fridge. About 1 hour before I planned on serving dessert, I left it out on the counter.  While we were bringing in all the lunch dishes, I set the oven to 450. By the time we were done cleaning up, the oven was ready and so I used an ice-scream scoop to spoon it into the 12 muffin pans lined with liners (just a hint- the tin foil cupcake liners were so easy to take off compared to the paper lines... they just slid off).  The were perfect in 8 1/2 minutes.  I placed them upside down on a plate, removed the cupcake liner, dusted with confectioner sugar and spooned a few sliced strawberries on the side.  Everyone loved it and asked that I make it again. I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips as the chocolate for this recipe - perfection!

I made these in six 8 oz. ramekins, but they ended up only 2/3 full.  Next time I'll use four ramekins so they'll be "topped off" nicely.  I used regular semi-sweet chocolate chips, but next time I think I'll use half semi-sweet & half dark chocolate.  I baked for 10 minutes and they're just about right.
I'm going to put one in the refrigerator, to take out and reheat in the microwave tomorrow.  As long as the consistency stays just right upon reheating, this will stay a 5 star winner in my kitchen.
UPDATE: The next day I reheated in the microwave, and it was still great.  I also froze one of the cakes I baked, took it out later, and reheated (from frozen) in the microwave for 30 seconds.  It turned out just right!

Four stars because of the texture of the "cakes" A little too eggy for us.  The flavor was very good though.  Next time I might add a tsp more flour and some instant coffee to enhance the chocolate.  I baked them in ramekins, worked better that way than in muffin cups.

Fantastic!!! It was a wonderful Valentine's Day dessert! I used ramikins and coated the insides with butter.  I then sprinkled sugar and cocoa inside to coat.  It left a wonderful texture! These sat in the frig for almost a day and we so perfect!! I just brought them out as I served dinner and let the oven pre-heat.  Popped them in and they were done in less than 10 minutes.  
We *will* enjoy these again! So simple and so good!

GREAT! Super-chocolatey. I tried not to "over-cook" and think it led me to under-cook, especially as I used custard cups (so be sure not to make them too full - they won't cook the same). I DEFINITELY plan to try again and adjust that.
** I've been making these all summer and have made a "name" for myself  - people are always asking (and expecting) this to be my contribution to get-togethers. And so simple!
Also, since I got more comfortable with them, I've gotten a lot better at figuring out cooking time - don't be intimidated!

Absolutely delicious! I used a 12 muffin pan, 6 white chocolate and six semisweet chocolate cakes.  The white chocolate cakes tasted much better as it was sweeter.  The semisweet cakes were not as sweet as I would have liked them... probably will add more sugar or use milk chocolate next time.

These were very good. I didn't have enough semisweet chocolate squares, so I threw in some pure chocolate chips (it was all I had) and reduced the sugar somewhat. They still turned out well, and I served them with vanilla ice cream since I didn't have raspberries. I had to increase the baking time a little bit for the edges to set, but I think my oven was having problems. I gave it four instead of five stars because a few of them ended up collapsing instead of standing nicely, but they were still delicious.

Very easy even to make for 2 using the portion calculations.  I used milk chocolate, baked in individual ramakins.  Suggest putting cream on the side rather than top to serve so that you don't collapse the cake.  Be careful not to overbake.

Unbelievable!  We have a family of 5 so I divided these up into 10 large aluminum muffin holders (so we each got two) and I'm glad I did or there would have been fighting over who would get the extra. I made the batter ahead, poured it into the greased holders and kept it refrigerated until we were almost done with dinner.  Stuck them right into the oven cold, cooked for 8 minutes and they were perfect.  I can't believe something so easy can taste so out of this world!!

I made this recipe for my attorney Eric's birthday since this is his favorite dessert.  This recipe was so easy.  Once the dessert cooled, I sprinkled more chocolate chips over the top and then heated it back up when we served it at work and then added the raspberries.  Eric was so impressed and said these molten cakes tasted better than the ones his mother made.  That made me extremely happy -- thank you for sharing such a simple and DELICIOUS recipe!

What a fantastic, easy, make ahead recipe.  I had some bittersweet chocolate on hand so I used a combination of semisweet and bittersweet.  It was amazing!  I followed the recipe as written and cooked for about a minute longer than stated.  The cakes were good re-warmed in the microwave the following day too!  I served with the raspberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Both the presenatation and taste were restaurant quality.  I love that you can keep the batter in the frig till you are ready to pull out and bake.  Very convenient.

Sinfully delicious!  Just like the Godiva Chocolate cake at Morton's Steakhouse - and A LOT cheaper!  I served with a sprig of mint and a scoop of Breyer's vanilla ice cream on the side.
Two thumbs way up.

Easiest dessert ever made! I brushed disposable aluminum cups with melted butter and baked them for 10min.  Then let them sit for 2 min. before unmolding.  Served with a little fresh cream (just slightly whipped) they are just great.  Serve at the end of a light meal so you can enjoy seconds ;)

I, too, made these for Valentine's day for my husband who is a chocaholic.  I got rave reviews!  Even though I sprayed the paper cups, the cake still stuck a bit.  I think next time I'll try the ramekins instead.  Great recipe that I'll definitely make again, especially when entertaining!  Quick and Easy!

I made this recipe this week-end for a small dinner party.  I must say they turned out fabulous!  I used ramkins and dusted them with cocoa.  I also used 2 cups of frozen raspberries, heated them up, mashed them and added 1 cup of sugar.  Once they were ready to come out of the oven, I then inverted the small cakes onto a serving plate and drizzled them with raspberry sauce and served it with ice cream.  They were a huge hit.  Thanks!

Absolutely fabulous.  I also used ramekins which make a nice presentation and easy individual portions.  Though using high-quality chocolate, such as Ghirardelli, is a MUST. The perfect addition to a romantic dinner.

OMG! I wish I could give these more then 5 stars! They are AMAZING! I mixed the batter in the afternoon, and kept it in the fridge until after , dinner, and they were AMAZING! I used a silicone baking tray, and no liners, and it worked perfectly! Didn't do the raspberries, just topped them with wipping cream. DELISH! I only used half the batter last night, and we just enjoyed the other half tonight. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I followed the recipe to a T. Like other reviewers that were worried about how a cake can set with so little flour and so many eggs, I was also skeptical. But with almost 21,000 saves and such a high rating, I thought I'd give it a go.

First of all... I had a heck of a time getting the batter to blend. With all those eggs, I guess it was hard for the chocolate to mix right. 

They were in the oven for about 20 minutes and were still runny. I finally took them out, and came to find that the chocolate and the eggs had separated... nice, bubbling, gooey chocolate on top, and cooked yellow egg on the bottom. NO WAY am I eating that, or serving it to anyone.

I made these today and it was quite the experience. I'm not a fan of the fruit topping, so I left it out. I tried it and they weren't sweet enough, for my taste, so I melted a little bit of vanilla icing and drizzled that over them and they were simply amazing! This was definitely a special treat.  :]

I used 8 oz of milk chocolate bars. And salted butter. And Omitted the pinch of salt. So after I finished putting all the ingredients together I found that I didn't have any cup cake liners!! I stored in the fridge over night, then an hour before using took it out so it could warm to room temp. I still wasn't able to get cup cake liners. So I had to find a diffrent way of cooking it. I ended up putting the "dough" (sure lets call it that) into individual dishes and put them in a water bath and cooked them for 50 min. at 450 degrees. It turned into a chocolate flawn, and was VERY yummy! On top I put diced up strawberrys mixed in sugar, and on top of that some wip cream! So even though I didn't get my lava cakes like I thought I was making originaly, I got somthing just as tasty useing the same recipe! The Recipe is great! So my rating is for the ingredients, cause I'm not sure what would have happend if I baked them the way the directions told me.

Tasted excellent. Do be careful not to over bake them or you won't have much of the molten middle. However, you will still have a tasty chocolate cake even if you do.

Fantastic! An easy recipe to prepare, with great results! I made a half recipe, as I was by myself testing for a dinner party to be held later in the  month. I also used greased ramekins, rather than muffin tin. I think I overfilled a little, but at 8 minutes of baking they "looked" right, but when I tried to turn the cakes out they fell apart and there was too much "molten". The second set baked at 10 minutes and were just right! Definetly a keeper!

Wow. This was awesome! We made them in a cupcake pan and the extra filling we had left was put in a greased ramekins. Ten minutes was perfectly oozy for the one in the ramekins, but if we ever make them in the cupcake pan again, we'll leave 'em in for only 8 minutes. Oh and we used Lindt intense mint dark chocolate...the flavor was perfect! It barely needed any accompaniment, maybe a glass of ice cold milk? Thank you for the recipe!

This was the worst molten chocolate cake I have ever made.  My family asked me to never make this one again.  It was very custardy and not very cakey.  The texture was very odd, almost "spongey".  It was not very chocolatey either.  I cooked it exactly like the recipe stated.

This is a very simple recipe! I have made this twice. The first time I baked it right away without letting it sit in the fridge for a couple hours - the taste was very eggy like what many reviewers have mentioned. However, based on some reviews here, the next time I made it, I let it sit in the fridge beforehand. That took away the eggy taste, maybe because the eggs have time to deflate. The taste was perfect, with a crunchy exterior and molten center. I particularly liked using a orange chocolate bar with almond slivers. Tonight I'm going to make it for valentine's day dinner, accompanied by homemade raspberry ice cream!

Fantastic! I don't bake much, but these were so easy. I also used the microwave to melt the chocolate. Cake batter turned solid after a while in the fridge (and stayed that way after coming back to room temp). This also filled 11 muffin holes. I had them in the oven for 10 minutes, the middle looked completely uncooked and the whole thing was very wobbly, but I took them out and as soon as they had been out for a minute they gained some firmness (which makes it easier to peel off the paper). If I had left them in longer they would have been overcooked. I will be making these at every opportunity!

Overall these are good lava cakes. Kids love them. I would recommend using FOIL instead of the paper cups as it is much easier to get off.

Did not like this molten cake at all. The batter was really spongy, and the molten inside didn't stay molten like. I found another recipe that uses baking chocolate and it is SO much better and even way easier to make than this one. Sorry, it just didn't work for me.

FABULOUS!  This is my new *go to* company dessert! Crazy easy (using ingredients I readily have on hand) and tons of impressive presentation possibilities!  Mine did crack when I plated them, so I need to determine what caused that and fix it, but other than that they were out of this world!  The 2 *non-dessert eaters* in the group even ate every last bite of theirs!  These are a MUST TRY that can make the most novice baker look like a rock star! TY for a great recipe!

WONDERFUL and very easy! Remember to add a little baking time if you refridgerate the batter. I think about 11 minutes is perfect (in my oven).

This recipe is awesome.  I have made it twice now and it is always a hit and always so easy!  I didn't bake in the muffin tins, but buttered ramekins.  I had some leftovers and put them in the refrigerator and warmed them up later in the microwave.

A decadent dessert made from home? Absolutely! Not only was this cake delish, the presentation was that of a five star (OK, four star) Resturant. I used remekins, (you can get them at Pier I for $1.00)Ghirardelli Chocolate Bar (you will need two bars, as they are only 4 oz bars) I cooled the cakes 5 minutes in the ramekins then flipped them upsidedown on pretty plates. I used fresh, whole strawberries since they were cheaper than rasberries.Top it off with sifted powdered sugar and you will be amazed what you have created. ~Enjoy~

I made this for my bible study class last night... They were ALL gone within 3 minutes!!! OUTSTANDING cupcake! BEAUTIFUL presentation no matter what kind of garnish! DELICIOUS! VERY CLEAR recipe! and oh so SIMPLE! :D Although, I did not refridgerate the mixture since I was in a rush; I just went straight from mixing to muffin pan. But it still came out HEAVENLY! Also, I tasted it without the garnishes and mMmm... the cupcake itself was sweet but not too sweet, chocolately, soft and very moist. The center was creamy, warm, and gooey. 5 THUMBS UP

outstanding!  I used 2 Tbsp of flour to make them a little more cake like for my children.  They still had a nice gooey molten chocolate center. I refrigereated left over batter and made more two days later. They were just as delicious!

Outstanding! Amazingly simple to make and the results were excellent. Made some in cupcake cups, others in 5oz. ramekins. Served on splash of vanilla custard/pudding with sliced strawberries.

I made this lovely desert for my valentine and he loved it.  The changes I made were that I used half margarine and half butter (ran out of butter) both salted, not a problem.  I used 8 oz clear glass custard cups and filled them with about 6 oz of batter each (6 cups total).  I also greased the custard cups with vegetable shortening and then coated it with sugar.  I made the batter the day before and refrigerated it in the individual cups.  I removed them from the frig about 45 minutes before baking.  I also followed another’s tip about knowing they are done when the top bubbles and cracks.  This was awesome.  So easy, and so delicious.  Thank you Pam!

These are without a doubt the easiest, most wonderful lava cakes ever!.  I have made them many times, and no matter whether I use butter or margarine, good chocolate, or chocolate chips, they are always delicious.  I don't make them in muffin cups, but rather, creme brulee dishes so I don't have to mess with paper muffin cups and have to remove them from a pan....just top them with the raspberries, ice cream, whipped cream or what have you!  Excellent, fool proof recipe.  Thank you

my father loves chocolate lava cake, and mentioned it the other night. i told him i'd be happy to make him some -and these really hit the spot. my only word of caution is, spraying the paper cups (i even used foil ones) with vegetable spray wasn't enough to get them to not stick. next time, i will line each with a bit of shortening and sugar (a la martha stewart). i had them in the fridge for a while too ... brough them out during dinner, and popped them in the oven while we were clearing the table. they even tasted delicious the next day, cold. great recipe pam! a keeper!

Absolutely the most incredible chocolate recipe I've ever made or eaten. Easy and so good. Had a few extra and stored them in the fridge. Just a warm for a few seconds in the microwave and they're still wonderful! What a great recipe! Thanks - will make this again and again!!

These were really easy and very good!  They are like mini chocolate souffles.  I made them in small ramekins, and they seemed to come out fairly nicely if you spray them with cooking spray, allow to cool slightly (3-5 mins) and run a knife all the way down the sides to the bottom and turn over.  For what it's worth, my husband actually thought they were just as good as the souffle at his favorite Atlanta fine dining restaurant!  I would definitely make this again.

My guests loved this simple, very rich 'adult' dessert; it was easy to make. I used glass baking cups instead of paper cups--I took them straight out of the oven, put on the raspberries and served them as is still in the cup. This way, I didn't have to stress about them falling apart while removing them.

Pretty good, but not like you get in the restaurants.  I'm probably a harsher critic because molten chocolate cake is my all-time favorite dessert.  My friends loved this recipe.

These were good I supopose, but don't be fooled, they weren;t the same as the ones you get at nice restaurants. They fell very badly (i know they are supposed to fall somewhat) but on presentation, they looked like . Tasted good though. I will keep searching for a better recipe.

Oh my goodness!  These were SO good!  I made these for a Valentine's Day dinner and they were a success!  The badder was simple to make.  I made mine ahead and baked in the muffin liners.  I sprayed them well and they came out easily.  So chocolaty, no need for anything else! Make these they are perfect!

Snaps for Pam! This could be the best chocolate dessert I ever had. I made them in regular size tins because I thought the large ones would be too big. Silly me, so instead I ate two topped with vanilla ice cream. I would so make this again and again and again!!

These are fantastic. I bake them for 8 minutes. Don't worry about them being runny, that makes them better. Too done and you've got a brownie. These are perfect as it. Didn't change a thing, except I used regular butter and omitted salt. Perfect fancy dessert for company( don't forget vanilla ice cream, it is absolutely necessary!!!)

Made this twice last month. HUGE Hit!  TO DIE FOR!!! Only as good as the chocolate that you use/ I used Callebaut and Ghirardelli bittersweet. I coated 8 ramekins with butter and turbine sugar, then added the batter and refridgerated well in advance; but must be brought to room temp before baking.  Ramekins require 1-2 more minutes baking. Put in the oven just as we started cleaning up dinner dishes. Serve right in the ramekin with scoop of good vanilla ice cream. Whipped cream wimped out on the hot cake. Thick batter traveled well/Baked at friend's house.

Absolutely divine. This really is the best Lava Cake recipe- better than any restaurant! It is so easy. Do not do in muffin cups; do it in ramekins. I like to make in advance and chill. That way it thickens up and it is easy to scoop into ramekin with an ice cream scoop. You can have it ready for a dinner party and 15 minutes before dessert time, pop it in the oven. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe! I made them with Bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate. I put the batter into 6 ramekins. I did make them in advance and they sat in the fridge all day. When I cooked them I set the timer for 8 minutes and kept checking every 2 minutes. Mine were perfect at 14 minutes. It might have taken longer because they had been in the fridge instead of room temperature. I put vanilla ice cream on top! Delicious and gooey in the middle!

Ok so im going to write this review first and then rate it.
Was very easy to make.
Wow does it give you a chocolate fix if thats what you need.
As someone else stated it was a bit airy for me and I was looking for something that was more dense. So I put it in the fridge after I spooned it in the muffin pans hoping that that would make it more dense. Didn't help too much.

I didnt have much of a liquid center. I left it in there 3 mins too long. But all in all it was still tasty. I was afraid it was going to be eggy because of all of that egg but it wasn't. 

I will attempt this dessert in the future. It was bit diffifcult getting out of the pan without breaking it. For that I give it four stars

Fool Proof! I've tried other 'lava' cake recipes and they all seemed a little difficult. This was super easy. I put mine in the fridge for almost 3 hours before baking. At first I thought I should put the batter in the muffin tins before the fridge, then second guessed myself after reading the directions again which said to refrigerate before separating into the muffin papers. Should have gone with my first instinct! I had to re-heat over a double boiler to get a consistency that would pour into my pans to bake. But that little miff aside - these were perfect! Will try a darker chocolate plus more sugar next time and maybe end up with a richer flavor.

I made this recipe despite reservations about the ingredients. I didn't understand how cakes with so little flour would not turn out as eggy custards and I was correct. I followed the recipe perfectly and got flat, eggy custard cups NOT molten lava cakes. I have no idea who others got this to work. I love to bake and am certain this recipe does not work. I'm going to keep looking.

I was disappointed in these little cakes. They were too cakey. I wanted rich, brownie like exterior, but they weren't like that. I definitely prefer chocolate souffle over these if you want rich chocolate gooeyness!

This recipe came out great. I made this a day ahead of time and baked them in ramekins. I eyeballed the time, but it was about 14 minutes. I made "Raspberry Sauce" from this site (made with a little extra sugar and Chambord) and I will definitely make this dessert again. Tomorrow. :) This is very rich, decadent, and yummy.

Added some imitation Vanilla and used 4 eggs...first batch didn't have the lava center but was very moist and very good! Gonna chill the rest of the batter and try it again tonight.  So far I would def recommend this recipe.  Update: Made this many many times in the last month...my thighs are not happy, lol.  So far it's best w/ Ghirardelli choc chips, then Guittard chocolate chips. Would NOT suggest using Tollhouse...may be good for cookies but its and inferior chocolate for this recipe. Also I've cooked it after refrigeration & when it was still warm...both turned out good, just cook it for a much shorter time (7-8 min) if batter is still warm. Add vanilla and don't over cook and I have a winner every time....that is if I can cook it b4 my kids eat all the batter! LOL.  My son has named this Chocolate Surprise...it is now their favorite desert (homemade or restaurant) bar none. My 14 year old has even told his friends about it, LOL. His birthday is on Mon and this is what he wans for his cake!! Too FUNNY, LOL!!

very good recipe but the use of muffin tins for cooking makes them too small and they aren't quite as molten as they could be.  better to use a larger souffle cup and extend the cooking time and then they are simply to DIE for...

These came out good but it was hard to judge the timing. I did a test batch as recommended, and needed 10 minutes, but they did not all bake evenly. I also found this recipe to be eggy as others suggested. It was very easy to make, however, and I will probably make it again -- but remove one egg from the recipe. I used smaller muffin cups and had no problems.

I made these without the sugar coated raspberries and served it with vanilla ice cream right out of the oven. Yummmmmy! I have already made them twice in a couple of days.

Would give five stars but made a big change.  I used batter as described but inserted a couple of pieces of cut up semi-sweet chocolate in middle prior to baking. But the cake surrounding the "lava" was excellent.  Everyone who tried it loved them.. but with the update made it very rich.  Cooked for about 11 minutes were perfectly cooked.  No problem getting out of cupcake wrapper if sprayed or buttered. Would make again

Fabulous, easy & elegant dessert! I actually found this recipe in her cookbook (Perfect Recipes for Having People Over)--great cookbook! I followed the recipe exactly. I agree with others that the cupcake liners kind of ruin the presentation, but I take care of that with a dusting of powdered sugar. I also STRONGLY recommend baking a test batch. The first batch I overcooked by about 1 minute (lacked yummy gooey-ness, just an "undercooked brownie" consistency). The second batch I filled them almost to the top and cooked a minute longer--worked like a charm! Do the test and find out how full to fill and long to bake. I didn't have raspberries--it's good without or possibly with vanilla ice cream. ENJOY!! (Posting a picture of my end result)**Also, just used Nestle semi-sweet, which was good. Will try again with a good dark chocolate.

Excellent flavor. The execution is a little tricky since every oven is slightly different. I ended up over cooking mine even though I only had them in for 9 minutes. If you're making these for a special occation, you might want to make a trial batch first to figure out how the recipe works with your kitchen. I also found that letting the cakes cool for a minute or so made them come out of the wrappers easier.

Absolutely fabulous recipe.  Made this for Mother's Day and the whole family (young and old) devoured them.  The flavors are rich and the recipe easy to assemble. This is a good recipe that every cook should print and keep. 

I doubled the recipe and used 10 ramekins in lieu of the cupcake holders. I used cooking spray in the ramekin to help cake removal.  It was a bit difficult to handle the ramekin right out of the oven but the trick is to run a knife around the inside edge, then place a plate on top, then flip.  The cakes dropped on to the plates and it was beautiful.  

I served this with the sugared raspberries and added whipped cream.  The final touch was a decorative drizzle of raspberry sauce over the whipped cream. 

It looked and tasted as good as anything I have ever been served in any high-end restaurant.

I converted this to a 4 serving recipe and used 6 oz ramekins. I buttered and sugared the ramekins and baked them after refrigeration as others suggested. I think I overbaked them because there was not much gooey center. You probably need to bake them for about 12 mintues in the larger than muffin size. They loosened easy with the help of a knife along the edges and inverted onto a plate. I served them with homemade vanilla bean ice cream with a candle for my mom's 60th. She loved them her favorite part was the crisp edges that the crystalized sugar made. She ate two servings. While my 5 yr old just had a spoonful of hers. ( That's why we rated 4) I didn't like the custardy consistency but my mom loved it. I'll try it again one day, I won't let any dessert get the best of me. (It has just the right amount of chocolatey!)

These were very tasty.  Instead of raspberries,which aren't easy right now for me to find, I melted over low heat a few tablespoons of raspberry preserves to make a 'sauce' instead. Be sure that if you are making the smaller size cupcakes to cook much less then the indicated time - probably check on them every 2-3 minutes.  I overcooked mine.  They were still yummy, and I had a few that still had a little molten center, but they probably would have been awesome with a lot of liquid-y chocolate oozing out.  I will have to try this one again!

Fantastic. I used a bar of extra dark chocolate, which was awesome.  I would recommend making a raspberry puree instead of whole raspberries so that each bite gets a bit of raspberry.  I also made my own whipped cream to top it.  It's rich, but it was gone FAST!

This was good, glad I tried it but not sure that I would make it again.  Definitely for chocolate lovers, and we are, and I thought I would like the soft runny center, but it just felt like I was eating cake that wasn't quite done yet, even though I know it's supposed to be like that.

this was VERY easy to make. perfectly gooey/wet inside w/ moist cake outside. mine was a little fragile..although it came out perfectly..it would collapse once put on a plate. only reason i gave it a 4 n' not a 5 is because it wasn't sweet enough for me. i guess i like sweeter chocolate if that makes any sense?

I made these for a small dinner party that we had and they were WONDERFUL!  Just as good as "Morton's Godiva Cake" and a lot cheaper!  Everyone licked their plate clean...I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  Even the one lone leftover was great the next day!  Thanks!

Holy cow! Amazing. My roomie and I have always been fans of the motlen chocolate cake and Chili's, but I think we like this version even better. It's nice to make a quick indulgent dessert for just the two of us, without having leftovers to tempt us for a week. It's a great dessert to make for company - looks restaurant fancy, but is easier than chocoloate chip cookies. Will try making it in the ramekins next time.

As far as chocolate desserts go, this one gives you the most impressive result with the least amount of work. It is simply amazing and delicious! I made it twice last week and am looking for an excuse to make it again. These little cakes are also wonderful the next day just plain by themselves. If you love flourless chocolate cake and gooey brownies, this dessert beats them both in terms of taste and ease.

These cakes were delicious and easy to make. I made them for Valentine's day, and since I had already baked dinner, we didn't have to wait for the oven to warm up, so it was really fast! I baked them 10 mn, I think that next time I will bake them 2 mn more, making sure I wont overcook them...

This is the first recipe I've tried for molten chocolate cake, and I'm done looking!  Followed the recipe exactly, and it was just PERFECT!  Next time I will be more generous with the cooking spray - Some of the cakes stuck to the paper and needed to be surgically removed to avoid a big gooey mess.

Spectacularly rich, gooey chocolate goodness.  I made it ahead (for company who didn't show up!) and put it in the oven straight from the fridge. I had to cook it a little longer because it started out cold.
The sugared raspberries make a great topping--the cold, tart juice and grainy sugar contrast nicely with the hot, sweet, smooth chocolate cake.

These were a big hit with my family and the company we had over for dinner tonight.  So easy, elegant and delicious!  I baked them probably about 12 minutes because I was nervous about them being "too gooey".  Twelve minutes was perfect!  I will be making these again and again.

Excellent, so easy to do, I halved the recipe and used 2 eggs instead, made 4 in a normal muffin tray. Popped in oven for abt 9mins, was ready JUST after the change of New Year so we celebrated with these and Vanilla Light. Only thing is the top had a hole and you could see the molten part. Should I serve them turned over normally? Tasted very good, my brothers loved it. 

I'm not a huge fan of choc, been thinking of these now and then since my friend made something similar but much richer about a year ago, this recipe was exactly what I was looking for, not too insanely sweet, just right, the non gooey molten part was soft and fluffy on the outside, moist and sticky inside.

Addition: Such a hit, my family asked me to make it again. Same amount of ingredients but I poured it into 5 muffin cups instead, put in oven for 6-7mins and they came out perfect. Still with the top gooey in the centre and a depression but they were circular otherwise and great with lots of vanilla ice cream.

This is absolutely amazing when it is refrigerated. It tastes like a flourless cake that melts in your mouth. I always like hot things better and with this, I can't believe how much better it tastes cold. Try it!

This dessert still tastes FANTASTIC even without the raspberries. We served this in a three course meal with cheese breadsticks and pizza and it was a great combo! It is very rich and fills you up very Quickly! mmmmmmmmmmmm.

These were fantastic! I made the batter in advance using Bakers semi sweet chocolate and chilled it.  I made 2 cakes the first night and then another 2 a couple of nights later.  Made in ramekins, so had to cook a little longer (about 11 minutes) because they were bigger.  I think this batch would have made 6, but I only made 4 because my husband kept eating the cold batter! He thought it tasted like frosting.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I just couldn't bring myself to bake for such a short time knowing that I would have uncooked cake batter in the middle.  I baked until the middle was nearly set.  I did take one out early as directed, and it was good, but found that I really loved the texture of the cake itself baked longer, and didn't miss the "molten lava" center.

I made this twice.  The first time I made the recipe as written and found it, like many other reviewers, too eggy.  I decreased the eggs to 4 next time and it was perfect.  I also added a dash of vanilla and tasted the batter to be sure I had enough salt.

Fantastic!  I took the suggestion of another reader and made this dessert about 5 hours before I wanted to bake them.  I did take them out of the fridge about 40 minutes before hand. They turned out perfect.  
I think the next time I will cook them in individual ramekins cups just to make it easier to serve.

So yummy ^^ Made this to go with a dinner at my boyfriend's house. We mixed the batter and it was rather runny at first. Then we set it in the fridge for about three hours. When it came out the batter was quite set and we were tempted to eat it as was. Popped it into the oven and ended up baking for ten minutes. Allowed ramekins to cool for thirty seconds or so before turning onto a plate and chowing down. Thanks for the recipe!

I usually go without the raspberries on this because I typically don't have any.  But with or without them, this recipe is delicious.

I'm a pretty lazy cook, so I warm up shortening (I don't buy bake-worthy butter...alas) and chocolate chips in the microwave for a few seconds, then mix in sugar and eggs in the same bowl (rather than getting a second one dirty).  They come out very well in spite of the fact that I didn't follow the directions.

I also don't use the jumbo muffin tins.  I was afraid that this would cause the centers to overcook, but fear not!  They still have the delectable molten centers :)

These were easy, terrific, and impressive.  I topped ours with strawberries (in season right now) and whipped cream.  Ours were a little overcooked (8 minutes means 8 minutes), but still soft and gooey inside.  I will DEFINITELY be adding these to our dessert rotation.

Very quick, easy and best of all YUMMY!!  I made them in a brownie cupcake pan (larger than normal muffin tin)  that I sprayed and they came out nicely right after taking out of oven.  Inverted them on a plate and served w/ ice cream and choco syrup!

These were good, and I made them twice, but both times I felt like it was missing something. Next time I think I will try to add a little Vanilla or Almond for some extra flavor, and possibly cook it a little longer so it is less molten.

I made this for company and it was a big hit! A bit stressful to prepare it during the middle of the meal (prepared batter beforehand but filled muffin cups while clearing the table) but I think my guests felt it was worth the wait.

This was perfect and so easy. I followed recipe exactly...just microwaved my butter (cut first) and extra dark choc chips very slowly. I prepared the batter and poured into ramekins just before serving dinner and let them sit out on the counter... then baked them as we cleared the table (although I did need to cook them a little longer than 10 min) they were done on the outside and just the right amount of gooey/liquid on the inside.

Absolutely delicious! Very easy to make too!  & I do recommend the use of extra large muffin cups, as the recipe calls for, they turn out much better (almost perfect) than the regular ones.  I'm definitely gonna share this recipe with my friends. :o)

I wasn't crazy about these cakes. Maybe I'm just not a molten chocolate cake person. They were a little bland and the consistency was strange. Gummy yet liquidy at the same time.

I'll I can say is - WOW! Thank you for sharing. Super easy to make. I made with Lindt Chocolate. I think the better ingredients you use, the better the product. Thanks for sharing!

My daughters (ages 10 and 7) wanted to try making these for our Valentine's dinner. The recipe was so easy. We made them ahead of time and refrigerated the batter in the muffin cups as others have recommended. They were so good! Topped them with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and some jarred hazelnut chocolate sprinkles that I had on hand. Thanks for a fun, easy and delicious recipe!!

um um good!! I made mine using 4oz ramekins and I was able to make 7.  I did put them in the fridge for about 2 hours before baking them.  I baked it for 11 minutes fresh out of the fridge without warming them up to room temperature.  By 11 mins they were starting to puff up.  I didn't want to over bake so I took them out.  Tried to turn them over on a plate but it just didn't work.  I guess I didn't spray enough of cooking spray, so I just left them in the ramekins.  And they were flowingggggggg~  Actually I think I probably could have left them in the oven for another minute to get the outer layer more crunchy.  They were really good!  Just like at the restaurants if not better.  One change I made was I used half bittersweet and half semisweet chocolate (Ghirardelli).  It was the perfect sweetness for me.

OMG, so good they are evil! I cooked mine in brule cups. Don't have giant muffin tins. I brushed each one with butter and rolled some sugar around in them. Made a nice carmelized crunchiness. Not sure if that is a word.Dang these were just sinful.

For me, these were just "OK".  I made in a muffin tin (standard size, made 12) and some had the molten center and some did not but all tasted very eggy and spongy and also lacking in flavor (and I used good chocolate).  My 6 year old DD loved them though and DH said they were good - but not as good as the ones we get out.  I think I'll save this dessert for an occasional treat when we eat out.  Was worth a try though!

Awesome - didn't change a thing other than presentation. I made this for a birthday dinner - the guest of honor's favorite flavor is choc/raspberry. I don't bake very well and because I was making everything, I wanted something foolproof - this is it! I made the batter in the morning and put it in (4) 4" souffle/ramekin dishes I happened to have(the ones with tops you can buy in the supermarket kitchen aisle) and stacked them in the fridge. After cooking, I poured Chambord on each plate and flipped each cake out (Pam is a must!), used a little powdered sugar and topped with the fresh raspberries tossed with sugar. What a hit! They loved them and I loved the ease. No more overpriced, tasteless desserts from the store!! This is my "go to" dessert for future dinners - thank you!!!!

I got rave comments on how delicious this recipe was and to make sure I make it again.  It was very easy and delicious.  I used ramikins but I am sure either way would work great.  Use your cooking spray and tip over to remove while hot.  Thank you for sharing.

These are SO DELICIOUS!  They are best if you make the batter and then chill for 3+ hours.  The texture is less eggy and more rich and chocolaty.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's going in the box!

Even with all the rave reviews I did not expect these to be as delicious as they were. I used larger sized ramekins and only make 6. Skipped the sugar-coated raspberries and made a raspberry sauce instead. Sifted some powdered sugar on top and they were beautiful. They are best fresh from the oven but I thought they were just fine reheated as well.

OMG!!! Thank you for such an easy recipe that is absolutly GREAT!!!  I halved the recipe using 2 eggs and baked 4 ramakins for 8 -9 minutes.  Topped with the raspberries tossed in sugar, then dusted with confectioner's sugar and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Heaven!

This is so delicious you have to try it.  I made the batter earlier in the day and then refrigerated.  After dinner I just filled large cupcake wrappers and placed them in the oven for 10 minutes.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Just outstanding!  I did not have any chocolate other than toll house chocolate chips and they worked just fine.

I made these for a dinner party!! They were great!! I made them in a muffin pan with silver foil muffin papers and I was too afraid to take them out of the papers (in case I accidentally split them and the molten middles ran out!!)  so I served them in the papers!!! I decorated the plates with raspberry "coulis" and sugared raspberries and sprinkled the tops with icing sugar and 1 sugared raspberry. My guests were very impressed, siad they looked and tasted like restaurant quality deserts!!!

Big hit with all the dads for father's day! We had just eaten this in Cabo and I thought I'd try it here. The chocolate didn't pour out like I expected - but maybe that was my error. Still, the cake was delicious and extremely moist. I will try again and will shorten the amount of time in the oven.

I have made molten chocolate cakes before with much success, but this recipe was disappointing. The cake was tasty, but the liquid center had a very distinct "eggy" texture. It was difficult to ignore, and even my boyfriend (who knows nothing about cooking or ingredients) mentioned the strange taste and texture. Will not make again.

This is a great simple dessert that isn't too rich, and is just the right size.  It's great to be able to make the batter ahead of time and have them baked in 10 minutes!  Changes I made:  used ramekins to bake and serve, served with a small scoop of vanilla ice-cream in the middle, used Dove dark-chocolate (4 squares per cake).  As far as baking-time, I tested with 10 minutes and 11 minutes.  11 minutes is just slightly too firm, 10 minutes has the perfect gooeyness to it in the middle, at least in my oven.  I'll be making these again and again!

Followed recipe as stated, and it was excellent! I used medium sized ramekins, and watched them like a hawk to make sure they were not overcooked. Served without raspberries, but with a dollop of vanilla ice cream- a hit with my 5 yr old!!!

These were just okay.  I personally didn't care for the texture- they tasted a little eggy and just felt like raw, undercooked cupcakes in my mouth.  The presentation is horrible if you make them as cupcakes as the recipe states... not pretty at all!  I'd definitely go the extra mile to make them in souffle cups if you are going to try this recipe.  I served mine with drizzled warmed up raspberry preserves and a dusting of powdered sugar to try to dress up the ugly-looking cake.  The next day, the hole in the middle becomes a crater and they look even less presentable.  If I am going to "spend" so many calories, I'd much rather have a nice piece of creamy cheesecake!

Very easy recipe. Made it exactly. I made enough for 8 servings and froze them with directions to bake at 450 degrees for 16 minutes. Whenever I need a quick dessert, I pop one in the oven. Thanks again for the recipe!

I made this for some friend who came over for dinner, we had all had this on a cruise but the home made version with Ghiradelli Chocolate was hands down the best dessert I've ever tasted. I will make this sinful delight very ofter.

This is an AMAZING recipe!! I had this on a cruise ship and couldn't get enough. I'm a little embarassed to say but I've made it about 6 times in 2 months.I do share though. The chocolate you use does make a difference.Try to make it good quality. I prefer salted butter.Then omitt the salt. I usually half the recipe and use 2 eggs turns out perfect not too eggy.Great for chocolate lovers!!!

This is so yummy!!  I used ramikens and custard cups for a prettier presentation.  The cakes slid right out of the cup.  Be sure to place the plate against the ramiken and then flip so the cake won't break in the process.  I left mine in the fridge and baked while still cold.  I think they were in the oven for about 10 minutes, and they were a bit underdone but still so yummy. I added whipped cream to the side and dusted the cream with cinnamon based on another review- this was an EXCELLENT addition.  Next time I think I'll use dark chocolate and cook for roughly another minute or so to allow the centers to solidify just a bit more (mine were very runny).  We had only one cake left over - which my husband and I prompltly popped in the microwave later that night and shared.  After 20 seconds it tasted freshly baked!  Thank you for such an easy and delicious presentable cake!!

These little cakes were fantastic!  I've made this recipe twice as written and it filled 6 ramkins that I prepped with butter and unsweetened cocoa powder.  Both times they sat in the fridge overnight to bake the following evening and they came out perfectly.  I served them in the ramkins and made a raspberry sauce in the processor using about 1/2c frozen,thawed raspberries, about tsp of sugar and a tbs or two of water. What a delicious and easy dessert that looks so impressive!

I thought these could be just a touch sweeter (probably because of the chocolate I used), but they were a big success with my dinner guests and very easy to make, with a beautiful presentation, so I'll give them 5 stars. I used Lindt Excellence 70% Cocoa and buttered ramekins. There were seven of us, and the amount of batter in the recipe as written was just the right amount for the ramekins. I served this right in the ramekins. I was really worried that they wouldn't turn out because I forget to remove the batter from the fridge in advance so it went in the oven cold instead of at room temperature, but it didn't seem to matter. Good recipe, thanks!

Restaurant quality! This cake was delicious and so easy to make. I made it on Valentines Day for my husband and daughter and they said it was "the best chocolate cake they ever had"! Just remember to bake it for only 8 minutes or you lose the molten effect.

This is a darn good recipe. I think it would turn out better if I used some Ramekins ( I used a cupcake tin ) or large muffin size tin. Regular size was a bit small. Do the eggs stay uncooked? Is this a good idea? That is my only qualm. Great otherwise!

I liked that I could make these ahead of time and pop them in the oven while making coffee for my guests, but the texture and taste were just ok.  I thought at first that I was disappointed because I had my first molten chocolate cake in a chateau in the Champagne section of France and nothing could compare, but nobody commented on these.  If I am going to indulge in a decadent dessert, I want to be wowed.

Good recipe, easy, and looks so impressive.  Served these at book group and no one turned them down!  But, at the risk of having people think I'm insane, I thought they could have been more chocolate-y.  Next time I may add some hot fudge sauce to garnish and give it more of a chocolate kick.  Thanks!

I liked this a lot because it was super easy.  Instead of using vegetable spray (I don't know why I don't like using it), I wrapped my fingers on one hand with saran wrap and took a paper liner in the other hand and buttered it.  Also, I find that removing the cakes are easy when they're slightly cooled, yet very warm as mentioned previously).  Take the cake from the tin, put it on a flat surface and gently, but quickly pull down the liner all around the cake.  Then flip the cake over while grasping each side of the liner and peel off the bottom.  You'll get the hang of it quickly. Thanks for this recipe!

Next time I will use ramekins!!!  I couldn't find the oversize muffin cups in 2 stores, so I just sprayed the tin.  Big mistake.  However, I managed a few lopsided cakes and dusted them with confectioners sugar.  They were delicious.  In spite of their appearance, my friends were impressed.  Salted butter worked great.

The raspberries dolloped on top were great, but the cake itself wasn't anything special.  I've had better chocolate cake...  But it made for a pretty presentation, and was easy to make.

Very good!  I used baking cups with ramekins.  Next time I'll spray the ramekins with vegetable oil rather than use the cups.  The cake still seemed to stick to the baking cups even though I sprayed them with vegetable oil.  This recipe is outstanding!  Make sure you have the berries to make up for the richness of this chocolate dessert.

Wow these are awesome! So easy to make as it doesn't take many ingredients. I was able to do it during a short study break and boy, was this a great treat. I actually didn't have a muffin tin so what I did was use a medium sized bowl, wrapped the inside in foil and then took it out and wrapped the remaining around for reinforcement. Then I took a small cup that was about the size of a muffin cup and carefully molded the middle of the bowl-size foil shape in. Then I folded the excess away from the opening so it stuck out the sides. And voila, a muffin cup with excess edges! Oh and I agree with other reviews on the fact that it really depends on the type of chocolate you use. I used dark chocolate from trader joe's and it turned out great. Have to pay attention to amount of salt next time though as I think I sprinkled in too much. Also, I cut the recipe in half and used 2 jumbo eggs. 

I know there was a one-star review saying she was expecting a cake instead. So for those that are were expecting a cake, you can actually use this recipe to make really moist chocolate cakes. All you have to do is after 10 min, turn off the oven and leave the cake in there for a while. The residue heat will fully cook the cake.

DO NOT BAKE THESE IN A REGULAR MUFFIN TIN.
Followed recipe as written. The cake taste fine, although I concur with others that have said it was "eggy". I tried it in a regular muffin tin and by the time the outside was done enough to hold its shape the inards were also done. 
In the end, my kids wouldn't even finish them and they love chocolate so we probably won't try this one again.

Excellent recipe.  Easy and great texture.  I made it with Salted Butter but next time I will try with Unsalted as I thought it tasted a bit salty.  But that is not the recipes fault.  Thank you for posting.

An absolute family favorite! I make this at least twice a month. My best friend asked for it for her birthday dinner. It really is easy and basically fool proof. Know your oven, however, because I had to adjust the temperature. Also, depending on if I use my silicone muffin cups or metal makes a difference. Metal cooks differently. With the silicone, it slides right out.

wow! I have never made lava cake before and it took me a few times to perfect it, but this is an amazing recipe. The trick is not over or under cooking it. It took me a while to figure this out, but you know it is ready when you gently shake the pan and it only jiggles a little. Also, some people say that you need "good quality chocolate," but I have found that good old chocolate chips work the best. YUM!

I love that it is made with ingredients we generally have on hand, and it is quick, easy, and so good that it rates as a "company" dessert. I use gluten free flour instead of wheat and we bake them in custard cups since we don't have the large muffin tins, and they are fabulous. Sometimes we mix frozen raspberries with a little sugar and warm in the microwave to make a warm raspberry sauce for on top. Heaven!

Excellent. I've been trying so many recipes and now I can stop looking. This is the one. AND, my daughter even agrees. 
The only thing I did differently is I make my own raspberry sauce so I used this instead of sugar coated raspberries.

These are truly amazing. Used ghiaradelli brand chips with a high cocoa content. Warmed some seedless red raspberry preserves in microwave til melted to serve alongside. Didn't sugar the raspberries but dropped a few on plate. Really very very simple and amazing taste! Thanks!

Was skeptical at first. Followed some of the reviewers comments: melted Choco+butter in the microwave -so easy. Also chilled the batter until ready to bake.

Buttered the hell out of my muffin tin (no paper) , poured in batter n baked for 10mins.  Served with raspberry sauce from this site. 

Results was WOAH! My dad doesn't eat desserts, but even he said it was good. Yay!

Update: it bakes more evenly when chilled for at least an hour, then whenbaked immediately after mixing up. I guess the time to rest helps the bubbles settle. Without resting, they came out not as pretty, but just as tasty! :D

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I used half Baker's semi sweet chocolate and half bittersweet Ghirardeli chocolate chips and that balances out the sweetness. I also think that this will not be as delicious without the raspberry ( I, by the way, used raspberry preserved and it is fabulous) so good! So easy to make but sooo good! I would probably try putting cherry and shaved coconut with the batter next time :) Thanks for sharing!!!

Almost too easy and too delicious to be true 
I'm currently studying in China and had to make some slight changes to the recipe but it still turned out great! 
There is no berries in season here so I bought some jarred raspberry jam and heated it to make it more like a sauce, still tasted awesome, will be making this recipe again

This was excellent. I even misread the ingredients and added 1 C of sugar instead of 1/2 and it still was fabulous. Next time I might use bitter sweet or mexican chocolate...something with a bit of spice. But as is, the recipe is great. Everyone enjoyed it and my sister even said these are something she would serve at her wedding. Definitely dinner party material.

absolutely wonderful recipe! no changes needed - they came out perfect! I made the batter in advance and refrigerated it - baking time increased to about 14 minutes as I didnt have enough time to let it warm to room temperature. Nice and gooey on the inside! served with Vanilla ice cream - was a hit!

If I could give negative stars I would. I did everything exactly according to instructions. My batter was extemely smooth and simply would not set. When I took it out of the oven 30 mins later, it was bitter and jelly like.

In terms of buttering the ramekins: butter the bottoms first, and then butter the sides, wiping from the bottom up to the top. It helps the chocolate to rise even more.

First had this dessert on a cruise & loved it! This recipe tastes just as good. Definitely use good quality chocolate. Followed other's recommendation and placed in fridge for a little while and then allow to come to room temp before baking.

Tried these with white chocolate, and they were too sweet but I can imagine that with a darker chocolate theyd be really quite amazing! Would love to know if anyone has any ideas to reduce the amount of extra sugar without affecting the texture of the cake?

This is awesome!  Very easy to make and my family loved it.  We had some left over, put them in the fridge and reheated them in the microwave for 20-30 seconds - they were just as good or better than they were the first time.  I will definitely be making this again.

Flawless!!! Worth more than 5 stars. Just make sure you serve them right away or they will keep cooking. Good fully cooked and molten, but better molten.

This is my first review, and the first time something completely did not turn out so I hope somebody is able to tell me what I did wrong.  I made the recipe for a smaller amount of people (it was automatically recalculated) and even though I used 1/4 cup butter...the whole batter was swimming in butter and so were the actual cakes once baked.  I even poured out a good amount from the batter because it was just drenched in butter.  Any idea why? Thanks!

This recipe is outstanding! I generally bake mine in ramekins and they come out perfectly in 10 minutes. Served up with a little ice cream and voila, an amazing gourmet dessert!

This recipe was fabulous.  My husband thought it was a tad bit eggy.  May try to leave out one egg next time, but will make these again and again.  Super easy.

This was a big hit, and soooo sooooo easy to make.  I made it exactly according to the recipe. except I left off the raspberries (which were ridiculously expensive) and used a couple of blueberries on each instead for "decor".  Baked exactly 8 minutes.  I left them in the cupcake papers to serve because it was clear to me they were going to fall apart if I tried to remove the papers.  Worked perfectly that way.  I'd actually give this 4+ and I will make it again and again.

Made this last September for my uncle's birthday.  They were soooo incredibly delicious, rich and warm and melted beautifully in the mouth, we each had two (followed by tummyaches that were well worth it). AMAZING. I can't wait to make them again. Maybe for Valentine's. :)

As these cool, the melted chocolate inside will get less runny.  I absolutely loved the texture - its comparable to chocolate mousse when you let it cool completely.

These were FABULOUS and soooo quick and easy.  I made them around 4 p.m. and didn't cook them until 8 p.m. and they turned out perfect!  I had 2 men leave the Giants divisional series game for seconds!!  I cooked them in 8 ramekins dusted with shortening, flour and sugar, baked them 8 minutes (next time I will cook them for closer to 10 minutes) and plated them with raspberries and whipped topping.

I made this for my Mother-in-laws birthday.  Wow what a hit.  Very easy and tastes like it came from a 5 star restaurant.  I used blackberries instead of raspberries.  It's all in the CHOCOLATE!

This is the easiest, most delicious dessert recipe I've ever made.  Its so easy I can get a random craving for chocolate and quickly whip up a recipe, eat one or two cakes, and take the left-overs into work.  My whole family and all my friends (and co-workers!) LOVE this chocolately goodness.

A little too egg-y (taste-wise).  Next time I will try one less egg and see how that goes.  I recommend not cooking it over 10 minutes.  I cooked one for 10 minutes and took it out and left the rest in for 12 - 13 minutes.  The 10 minute one wobbled a little when I took it out, but as soon as I cut into it - it oozed.  The 12 - 13 minutes ones had creamy, but not oozy centers.

This recipe was very easy. I cut down the recipe down for two people with good results. When I filled the muffin pan with the batter halfway it puffed to the top and actually deflated back to its original size upon taking them out of the oven. I then stacked two little cakes in between ice cream - delicious. When making the cake, I tempered the eggs with a tablespoon or two of the hot chocolate before stirring all of it in. I greased the pan without using liners and they popped out fine with a tap. For me, a cooking time of about 7 minutes was fine.

Great recipe! we used to get these from the bakery but now we make them at home and they are even better. The first time i made them i used standard couverture chocolate. The second time, after reading the reviews about the quality of chocolate, i used Cadburys Bournville Rich Dark Chocolate and President butter and it made a big difference to the taste. I used one chocolate bar and one butter (200gr each) so no need to even measure, they turned out fantastic! Will be making them again for sure.

I tired this recipe as a birthday cake in a 9 1/2 inch pan. I baked it for 18 minutes. the center of the cake did not seem like it is cooked but when it cooled down it tasted quite good... I wouldn't say it is the best lava cake I have ever had an that can be because I did not bake it as cupcakes. Next time I will try other versions - cupcakes, with more flour, etc... Also, I added about 1 Tablespoon more sugar that given int he recipe and the sweet content was perfect!

I have made these twice; once for practice and then for an anniversary party.  Everyone that tried them loved them!  I followed the recipe exactly but served with vanilla ice cream.  They were a huge hit!  A few weeks later my husband and I had a chocolate lava cake at a restaurant and we both agreed that this homemade version is way better!  I will definitely making these again!!

This was my first attempt at a molten chocolate cake, and it turned out pretty well. (I've never even had them so I didn't know what to expect).   They were really easy to make, but I'm not sure I loved the "uncooked" texture inside.

Awesome!  I made them in regular sized cupcake tins and they baked for about 6 min.  Refrigerated the left overs and baked cold the next day for about 8:30.  I liked it better the 2nd day.

Easy to make with ingredients readily at hand (although husband swore up and down we didn't have chocolate squares....until I walked over to the pantry and got them out). Quick prep, quick baking time, great for a chocolate fix. I halved the recipe and still got about 8 regular cupcake sized cakes. I probably should have baked for about 7 1/2 minutes or so to get that ooey gooey molten texture - but still yummy dense chocolate at 8 1/2 minutes.

Loved this one too! So easy, and so delicious. So rich.  I agree using a microwave instead of a double-boiler works just fine.  They do taste great even the next day when they cool down, maintain moisture perfectly, though obviously the iddle is no longer molten.  Remember to wait til it cools to room teperature before sprinkling sugar on it!

I had the same problem as a couple of other reviewers...spongy and eggy.  Not appetizing or chocolatey.  I'm sure I did something wrong, but not sure what it was.

I followed the directions exactly but ended up with gross, eggy custard cupcakes.  I've been baking for years and never had a problem so I don't know what happened here...

The XL muffin cups in a standard muffin pan, ruined the cakes for me.  Since they are too big, some parts of the cups folded and the folds were baked into the cakes, so that when I tried peeling them off, it pulled the cake open spilling all the chocolate-y goodness.  But MY OH MY!  Since I was making this for a bday party, I had to leave em in the paper cups at home and go buy a store bought cake, which really made me upset.  My anger immediately dissipated once i tasted the ruined cakes.    So this is what "SINFULLY DELICIOUS" tastes like..

AMAZING!  This was the exact thing I was craving and way easier than I ever imagined it could be.  My husband has declared this to be our new staple (as we typically have all ingredients on-hand).  Yum, yum, yum!   (We didn't serve with raspberries, but we are thinking of trying ice cream next time.)

These are great!  I have made them about 4 times now and I use the large 6 muffin, muffin tins, so they have to cook a little longer to be firm enough to put on a plate.  If you overcook them they of course will not be molten-like and will be a gooey version of a cupcake.  I used the Ghiradelli chocolate chips as someone else has suggested.

This was extremely easy to make.  Didn't alter the recipe at all.  I heated a handful of white chocolate chips and 1 TB of shortening in a microwave bowl to make a white chocolate sauce and spooned some for the cake to sit on and then drizzled it on top and on the plate for a really elegant desert.  My husband was awed and loved it!

Love it! We really like the taste of chocolate and raspberries in our house. We make the cakes and then as the topping put a teaspoon of raspberry Polander fruit spread, four or five fresh raspberries and a little powdered sugar. Perfect!

This was a surprisingly easy but absolutely delicious recipe! I made it for Valentine's and the boy was impressed! The only changes I made were that I halved this recipe but only used 2 eggs and upped the baking time to about 11 minutes.

I made these for Valentine's Day.  They were quite easy and extremely tasty!  I made the batter earlier on in the day and we just put them in muffin cups and stuck them in the oven when we were ready for dessert.  They are also good warmed up later in the microwave.  I served them with raspberries coated in sugar and Cool Whip.  I pretty much followed the recipe and it was great.

Made these tonight and they were so easy and amazing! I made them about 4 hours in advance and left out for about 45 minutes before baking.  Served with vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries and blackberries on the side and some powdered sugar on top.  Look and tasted so fancy!!

These are absolutely sinful, elegant and definitely one of the easier molten chocolate cake recipes I have come across...I've made this recipe multiple times (without the raspberries)and refrigerating the batter anywhere from 2-5 hours (however long of time you can allow) really makes a difference. I butter/grease individual ramekins well to prevent sticking and as they cool before I'm about to plate them, run a knife around the edges of the ramekins and flip the cakes out on a plate. Serve warm with vanilla icecream and you will be in heaven. I plan on fixing them for valentine's day this weekend :)

This was easy and my family loved it! I used good dark chocolate (Lindt) and added raspberry syrup...next time, might try triple sec, strawberry, amaretto, or hazelnut.  Had trouble getting them out of the muffin papers...they wanted to fall apart.  Also, needed to cook a little longer, but came out perfectly!

taste was only okay... very eggy. i made them in smaller cups (because i have little brothers who hog sweets down very fast) and they came out terrible. the middles were not molten at all. i followed the recipe to the T. they had what i can only describe as... chocolate quiche middles. wow, for some reason, allrecipes edited this review. i made a 2nd batch and they came out better, but that was after cooking them 2 minutes less. even so, the outside was like the chocolate quiche and the inside was gooey.

It was like an uncooked brownie, no goo in the center as promised.  I recently measured the temp of my oven, its w/in a normal range of the set temp, so that wasn't the problem.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the paper cupcake cups, I sprayed the cupcake tin with non-stick cooking spray and powdered w flour, they came out easily.  I'll try the other 'Molten Chocolate Cakes' recipe next time... or just buy the betty crocker version at Wegmans.

I had bought these molten cakes at a large warehouse store and LOVED them. This recipe is better. If you love chocolate and a gooey center, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

First time making molten chocolate cake. Very easy to follow recipe & the cakes are tasty.
1. I use microwave for melting chocolate & butter (don't cover the bowl).
2. Taste 'a little bit' eggy, but it's acceptable for me.
3. It's better to wait 20 mins before serving, so that the centre not too runny.
Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor of these was quite good and, compared to a more complicated Emeril recipe, a good efficiency value.  A couple of thoughts, though.  Peeling the muffin papers off was a pain -- why not just grease & flour (or use cooking spray) in the tins?  You could avoid hassle and avoid lines in the side of the mini cakes.  I will try that next time.  Also, I found the sugar-coated raspberries not that exciting.  Next time, I will sift powdered sugar over top, and garnish with in-season fruit without added sugar.  Worth trying.

This is a great recipe!!  It's easy to make  and tastes like you slaved over it!  My friends were really impressed.  I used little ramekins to bake them in and got 6 well portioned servings.  I think they needed another couple of minutes in (I put them in for 10), but they still were great!

I made this for Valentine's Day night dessert. I made the batter ahead of time and left it in the fridge.   I had to cook them a bout 4 minutes longer than called for in order for them to be the perfect amount of "lava" in the middle and not too "melty".  Soooo good! Oh and I made them with strawberries on top. Yummy!

Good and VERY easy.  I halfed it and used only 2 eggs and was definitely sufficient. Used milk chocolate but would recommend darker or bittersweet chocolate (as recipe states) instead for more flavor.  Tough to get cooking time right since all ovens are different so definitely watch!

This is good!  Make sure you serve it with ice cream :)  And make sure you spray the muffin paper liners with enough oil otherwise they will stick.

These were incredibly simple and fairly tasty, although I overcooked mine by just a minute or two, so they weren't liquid in the center. The flavor was lacking a little something--maybe I needed better chocolate, or a tsp of a flavored extract or something like that. At any rate, I would certainly make them again.

Made these on a cold winter night when I needed a quick dessert for girlfriends.  It was a hit because the chocolate was so good.  I did have difficulty removing from ramkin . . . I served them in puddle of fudge sauce with whipped cream.

These were perfect.  I didn't add the raspberries because I didn't have any when I made them.  They were still a hit.  I made them at the last minute for some people that were popping over to my house.  It was very easy and fast!  My guests asked for the reciepe too!

Greased AND used PAM on mini fluted bundt pan.  Filled each with 1/2 cup batter.  Cooked 9 1/2 minutes.  Turned out onto wax paper squares on a cookie sheet.  Slid cakes onto individual plates.

This is a very impressive dessert. I use star shaped foil cupcake pans. It is so easy and I love being able to make it ahead of time and just pop them in the oven when you start the main meal.

This recipe is delicious!!  We couldn't eat them all the first night, but reheated in the microwave for a few seconds and they tasted just as good.  Be careful not to heat too long though or the center filling will start to bake.

Fantastic recipe! SO easy! I halved it, as I do with almost all new receipes I try.  Used Hershey's chocolate chips and melted them wih the (salted) butter in the microwave(on a low setting), didn't add the pinch of salt, didn't use paper muffin cups but sprayed jumbo muffin tin with Pam with flour in it.  They spilled out easily.  Used thawed frozen berries (I live in the Middle East so fresh berries are EXPENSIVE HERE), rolled them in sugar and then topped off the cake with icing sugar for a nice look.  Next time I will make them in ramekins at the advice of others, so no chocolate is lost when spilling them out!  Excellent!

I love the recipe. When I'm craving serious chocolate, this is my "go to". It's quick and easy.  It's also really flexible for the type of chocolate, I've used ghiradelli dark chocolate, semisweet chips, and even some milk chocolate. I think a mixture of chocolate makes the best cake, but all kinds work. Oh, I usually don't have the raspberries, so I just serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. When I make it for company, I'll just heat up some seedless jam and thin it out with OJ or grand marnier to make a sauce to drizzle it with.

These were good and so easy to make!  I served mine with a raspberry sauce that I made from frozen raspberries, sugar, and cornstarch.  I also topped with whipped cream, although this would be great with ice cream, too.  I'd love to try this with fresh raspberries, but there weren't any available today at the store.  Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed.

This recipe is GREAT!!!!  I made it twice and had vanilla ice cream once and home made whipped cream the other.  I can't seem to cook it long enough because I'm afraid of overcooking but regardless it is still an excellent blend of cake and melted chocolate.  Maybe I will get it right and cook it long enough but I'm not sure if I want to.  I wish I had chocolate to make some now.  Yummy!!!!

Left out the raspberries and made these in regular-sized muffin cups. The recipe made 16 small cakes this way, which came out perfectly! My first attempt at molten cakes, and definitely a success.

Super easy, great taste.  My girls even liked these.  Halved the recipe with no problems.  Have made twice now and perfect both times.  Did not use the raspberries any time-sure would be good just never have.  Put a small heart on top them dusted powdered sugar on once-looked pretty.

This recipe tasted strongly of eggs to me, and not strongly enough of chocolate. I was also expecting a more "cake-like" texture. My boyfriend says he doesn't taste the eggs, and he'll eat it, but he prefers my cookies.

so easy to make and very delicious.  If you just want to make mini moist chocolate cakes, just bake them a little longer and they come out quite well too.

We tried this treat for the first time on our summer cruise and it quickly became our favorite dessert.  I tried the recipe last evening for Valentine's Day and it was FABULOUS!!! As other members, I used ramekins & baked for 12 minutes per suggestions. However, next time I will bake for only 10 or 11 minutes as we like more oozing in the center.  This is a keeper!

This dessert is awsome!  I barbecue for my friends every Friday, and the special request was for something with chocolate and raspberries that is cakish. Loved that I could make it ahead of time and leave it in the fridge.  I bought little pyrex ramikin-type bowls just for this dish that I didn't have to remove the dessert from and sprayed the inside with butter-flavored cooking spray and filled them to the lines on the bowl.  I ended up with 5 desserts instead of the 8 muffin cups, but that was A 0k as we had four people at dinner and one left over for later.  I purchased a pint of fresh from Wilsonville local organic big fat plump berries from New Seasons (didn't have time to hit the farmer's market).  I was worried that the sugar might be too much with all that molten cake, but I queried my dining guests and they agreed to put in the sugar...mmmmmmmmmmmm.  SOOOO GOOD. The cake was all runny and gooey inside and mixed with the berries was heaven in a dish.  IT was a HUGE hit!  Thank you very much for the recipe.  I am sure I will be making it again sometime.  Lisa, Portland, Oregon.

I made this recipe a couple of hours before baking; kept it refrigerated and brought to room temp per recipe.  The cakes were delicious.  Served with coconut/pineapple ice cream.  Truly simple for such a decadent chocolate treat.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good, but not as richly chocolately as I would like.  I will try with bittersweet chocolate next time.  I think they take a minute or two longer if you cook them in ramekins.

We had a sample of similar little molten chocolate cakes at a well known kitchen shop and my step-daughter just loved them but rather than spend $24 for the mix, I found this recipe and boy am I glad I did! They turned out great and I warmed leftovers individually in the microwave for 20 seconds for a nice treat the next day. My step-daughter actually said they were BETTER than the sample. This is definitely going to be a regular in our house!

Without the raspberries this cake would be very bland.  The "molten" chocolate was not very rich.  I was hoping for something similar to what you would find at the resturaunts.  It was easy to make and the muffin tin worked good.

Don’t over cook. Just letting it sit for a few minutes on the counter can cause the dessert to become chocolate cake!

This is a fantastic recipe-- very easy to put together. My first batch came out okay but a bit under-done. I allowed them to set for a few minutes but there was still more lava than cake (lol). I used high quality dark and semisweet chocolate. Instead of  muffin tins I used 6 ramekins. The first attempt wasn't perfect but totally edible. It's probably user error: I was concerned about overcooking the cakes and most likely should have left them in another few minutes. In total I cooked the ramekins for 12 minutes. I make another round of them because they really are tasty and an easy, simple dessert which can be customized.

Just added a wee bit of Madagascar vanilla extract to the mix and a little more flour to tighten the batter.
Everyone raved about how delicious they were!!

This is a great recipe for last minute dinner get together.  Ingredients are usually in the pantry or easy to get, it's easy and fast to make and looks and taste like a lot more effort than needed.  A winner all around.  
I always serve with ice cream.

I made this for my adult daughter’s birthday. I cut recipe in half (but used three eggs). I melted the butter in microwave then added the chocolate chips and stirred. Kept heating it in 15 second increments and stirring until chips were melted. Then followed remaining instructions. I cooked them in 8 oz ramekins sprayed with nonstick spray but did not remove them from ramekin for serving. They turned out perfect. Recipe was quick and delicious.

Easy to overcook! Don't cook past 10 mins!! Looked like they were not finished at all (bubbling in the middle and sides didn't look firm enough, so cooked over 10 mins, then took them out and they were overcooked, with no melted chocolate inside.) Made more chocolate/butter mix and poured on top to make up for it. Tasted good but not incredible. If you use Pam in a ramekin, they come out cleaner than Pam and muffin liners. They did come out fine. 

Good tip for getting them out of ramekins: place plate on top of ramekin, then flip. Make sure they've cooled down a couple of mins before you do this, they'll come out easy.

These are yummy and so simple. The first time I made a half batch but forgot to cut the sugar in half.  They were amazing even though I cooked them a little too long. Lava cakes they were not but still really good.  The 2nd time I did a full batch and followed the recipe better. They weren't as sweet but with raspberry spice and vanilla icecream I didn't miss it. Watch them close the last 2 min or so to make sure you don't over cook them. Both times I cooked them in a cupcake tin with regular cupcake papers.  Having longer ones would definitely have made getting them out easier.

Some reviewers clearly have no understanding that a molten lava cake is supposed to be liquid on the inside!!  That being said...I've had better tasting recipes than this one that used less egg.  To reviewers saying this is spongy, you are most likely over-baking.  Or possibly not using room temp eggs and butter....mixing egg and sugar until it's fluffy is key.

Super duper easy to make before guests arrive, and then remove from the refrigerator when serving the appetizers.  After cooking, allow to cool for a 5 minutes or so; this cooling step makes it easier to remove the paper muffin wrapper.  The raspberries had too much sugar.  Otherwise, this is a very fine recipe.

this is my go-to recipe for molten chocolate cakes by far. That being said, the addition of 1 tsp of vanilla and a tablespoon of instant espresso vastly improves these.

These were so easy, fast and yummy.  I did find that I needed to divide into 12 cupcake liners, instead of 8.  Great recipe for a chocolate fix!

Took other reviewer's advice and made batter ahead of time and refrigerated.  Also baked in ramekins.  The Pyrex type worked much better than the white ones.
Since some of us are celiac, I used one tablespoon of g free flour instead of 4 tsp flour. The whole family LOVED!

I've made this several times and my only variation is that I use porcelain 10 oz individual souffles, which are far more convenient to fill and serve -- plus they look nice.

I used a mini-bundt pan because I couldn't find any "extra-large" muffin paper cups, and they turned out perfectly! I cooked for a total of 11 minutes, and the center was still ooey-gooey and delicious. I know that a mere 4 tsp of flour seems crazy - but it worked like a charm! They rose beautifully, and I was able to invert the entire pan to remove them without sacrificing the integrity of the cakes. (I did spray the pan with cooking spray, but next time I'd like to try butter and sugar!)

Chocolaty deliciousness. I've made these 2 times now and they are just delicious! I only bake them 9 minutes so it's  just enough that they are molten even after a reheating. One for me is plenty since they are so rich. Will continue to make them.

This has become one of my "go-to" recipes!  My sons and their families absolutely love it, and it's so easy!   The first time I made it, I baked it a little too long and it wasn't molten, but it still got rave reviews because of the deep chocolate flavor.  And now, I'm beginning to crave it, so I'll have to make it soon!

I do not like chocolate, I am one of the odd people. I have made this several times and I LOVE it!!!! This is a super simple recipe and I can eat 2 servings myself.  I use salted butter so I omit the salt and I don't need the raspberries except for garnish so I omit that.  I get a craving ever several months and this is my go-to. You can NOT go wrong with this one,

My husband wanted molten chocolate cake for Father's day. I doubled this recipe and made 12 8oz. mason jars. Next time, I'll bake them a little longer (since I'll use the mason jars again) because some were soft, pudding like, which didn't bother anyone. I served them with fresh raspberries and vanilla ice cream. This just became a family favorite!

Amazing dessert!!! It was so easy to make, I made these tonight and they turned out nicely. I watched them like a hawk the whole time they were in the oven. I removed them just when the tops lost their wet gloss and became dry on top. This turned out to be 14 minutes exactly in my oven. I used smoked semi-sweet chocolate chips, these cakes were a big hit tonight. I recomend you to put the cakes in the refrigirator for at least an hour before cooking them.

Based on the title I was expecting a liquidy chocolate filling to ooze out when we cut into them.  These were just mini-souffles, which were nice but not "molten" chocolate cakes.  The sugared raspberries were a hit though!

I made this tonight for dessert for my dinner guests. They all loved it. The eight year old daughter of one guest said I should start a Dessert restaurant.

This was great, but I regret hesitating when taking them out of the oven, they were a bit too cooked. I made it in a cupcake mold, so the bake time was a bit off. I recommend 7 minutes. This recipe is very easy, and (Yay!) didn't leave a mess after.

Portion size is skimpy for 8. Better for 6. I used my Pyrex dishes instead of paper cups. So easy it's dangerous.

Halved the recipe for our family of four, using 3 large eggs and 4oz Ghiradelli 60% cacao chocolate chips. Baked for 8&1/2 minutes in individual glass Pyrex dishes sprayed with cooking spray. This is one of our favorite restaurant desserts but has now been perfected at home!

Eh, this recipe was just ok for me. I felt like it was missing a depth of chocolate flavor that i was hoping it would have- it also seemed a little eggy to me. I wonder if adding some espresso powder and maybe some vanilla would deepen the chocolate flavor? I did add about a teaspoon of espresso powder but it didn't do much. I do however, like the ease of baking these in a muffin tin pan with the liners!!

These were so easy to make my 11 year old made them.  She was so proud she could make something so good.  To make it safer she melted the chocolate mixture in the microwave.

Delicious, beautiful, easy dessert! I followed the recipe exactly and the cakes came out perfectly! I baked them in 6 oz. ramekins for @ 11 minutes. Drizzled chocolate syrup in pretty pattern on each serving plate, sprinkled powdered sugar on top and adorned with few raspberries & one strawberry (with green stem attached for color). Gorgeous and so delicious - looked & tasted like they were served in a fine restaurant! Husband & guests were very impressed! Will definitely make these again!

Before I made this, I read many of the reviews. I decided to make 4 servings, and use half semi sweet and half bittersweet chocolate. Based upon other reviewers suggestions, I made the batter ahead and refrigerated it for about 5 hours. I took it out about an hour before filling the ramekins. At 8 minutes, they were still soupy, so I added 2.5 more minutes. Still not done, so I added another 1.5 minutes. The tops were puffed and cracked but they could have been a bit overcooked at that point. It was still a delicious dessert. Next time I will butter the ramekins and sprinkle sugar inside. Before serving, I will hit the tops with a bit of fleur de sel for added depth. We had this with a raspberry coulis underneath. Awesome!

Divine and easy.  Didn't have raspberries so I just ate it straight, with a powdered sugar dusting.  Nothing to be ashamed about.  They do deflate a bit when cooled.  Recommend eating straight away.

I followed the recipe to a T.  I used Ghiradelli chocolate since several reviews said to use a high quality chocolate.  It tasted ok.  The molten part was very good, but the cake part tasted like it was missing something.  It didn't seem sweet enough almost (if that's possible considering how much sugar was in it).  It just wasn't my taste, but it definitely was easy.  I baked one to test it out and did 10 minutes and it was almost baked through.  Put one in for 8 minutes and it was perfectly molten.

This turned out so, so well and got a very enthusiastic reception from everyone. I cooked mine in 8 ramekins, and though I think they would've turned out a little taller and prettier if cooked in 6 ramekins instead, they were delicious - ooey, gooey, and delicious.  I served them on a little bit of raspberry sauce from another allrecipes recipe and was really pleased.

Just getting ready to make it again-this time for company. First time I had anything close was when we were on vacation in Florida. Then, I thought the recipe was to die for! This is every bit as wonderful and the kicker is that it's so easy to make! I also prepared ahead of time and refrigerated until baking time. Love that they can also be frozen and popped into oven for 14 min. Also delicious with cherry pie filling over top and vanilla ice cream melting alongside.

This is an easy recipe to follow. I unfortunately under baked by about a minute or so as I added the batter to ramekins. Will cook about 13 mins the next time. Also I used Green and Blacks Dark Chocolate 70%. Will use a much lower % the next time as it was not sweet at all. Its all I had and forgot to add extra sugar to sweeten. I had it with vanilla ice cream. Looking forward again to get it right and be able to enjoy it. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a winner! I took a big chance and made this for the first time for Christmas dessert. 
I used ramekins instead of the papers but otherwise followed the recipe exactly using quality chocolate - oh, and I made them a few hours ahead and brought to room temp before cooking. Every plate was clean and even a 15 year old niece asked for the recipe.   Great, great recipe. This is one of those recipes I thought was way above my baking skills but surprisingly easy and quick. The results are just like the lava cakes in restaurants!

I converted this recipe into metric and followed it exactly, baked it at around 230 degree celcius.
After 8 minutes, the top part was burnt and the inside bit was not cooked at all.

This recipe couldn't be easier and more delicious!  I followed the instructions and even used cheaper Sunny Select chocolate chips that were God knows how old and the cake still turned out delicious and fell out of their molds perfectly.  I burnt my tongue eating the hot molten center.  

This would be perfect for the upcoming Valentine's day!

These were really simple to make, extremely tasty and gobbled up by all of our guests even after a very big dinner.  The only complaint I had was I couldn't find the extra large muffin cups so had to make the small versions instead.  Since they are gooey in the middle, the smaller version kind of shrunk too much after I let them cool enough to eat.  I am on a mission to find the bigger muffin cups so I can make this again...I am sure the bigger version is the only way to go. Yummy!

Used Ghiradelli chocolate bars, they turned out amazing! Followed recipe, but accidentally added 4TBL of flour instead of tsp and they still were awesome! Used the 1/2 cup of sugar on the rasberries, but was way too much, washed it off and used less than a 1/4 and that was plenty.

I made this for my own birthday cake since I did not want my non cooking family to waste money on crappy grocery store cake...it was a good birthday!!  This was sooooo easy quick and yummmmmyyyyy.  I made the mix the day before and refrigerated it, popped it into the oven from the fridge and 10 min later had a dessert to die for.  I did use the microwave  for melting and then mixed it all and I froze the raspberries right after sugaring them so they crystallized. It was perfect. Thanks so much and happy birthday to me!

We used to pay around 8 bucks when we go out for dinner to get this! I tried this recipe and my husband loved it! We both had seconds! The only thing is that I felt that it had a very eggy taste.. Maybe because my eggs were too large?

This stuff is amazing! I made it for book group and they ate it up! I'm so glad to have found this recipe. When you talk it out of the oven you can't wait to rip into the pudding center. Delish!

have made this several times (mostly without the raspberries) and it is very good; just have to be careful on not overcooking and keep center slightly gooey

I totally screwed this up! I used the servings calculator to just cut it down to one serving for myself, but didn't pay attention to the fact that it wouldn't be able to cut 5 eggs down appropriately.  It told me to use 1 egg and I did. I almost came back and rated this low because it tasted way too "eggy"....then I saw my mistake.  I am sure these would have been great otherwise.  It was super simple to make!

Good flavor but my chocolate was not melty in the center like I was expecting. The whole thing was very moist & I used Lindt chocolate. I made mine in 6 ramekins but had to cook longer than expected bc it was runny. I will keep looking for a diff recipe.

I think I may have overcooked these a little bit, they were a little too set to be molten lava :( however, the middle was still soft and moist, and the flavor was wonderful. A bite of chocolate with a bite of sugary raspberries.....SUPERB!   I will definitely try this again and shave a minute off the cooking time to see if i cant get it exactly right :)

I've always loved all the molten lava cakes served at restaurants and these were just as good, if not better! The recipe is incredibly simple and even though I accidentally let mine get a little too done, they tasted soooooo good! I will pull them out a little sooner next time so the center is more "molten". Now I can have molten lava cakes whenever I want! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These cakes are wonderful! My husband and I had some like these on our honeymoon and when we got home he asked me if i could make something like it. I found this recipe and he likes them even better than the ones we had at an expensive restaurant! Now he asks me to make them all the time! The only change I made was to substitute raspberries for strawberries. I will definately be sharing this recipe with everyone I know!

On our honeymoon we were introduced to molten lava cakes and we both looooved them. Once we got home, I decided one day to try and make my own. We both loved this recipe and will definitely make them again. The only thing I didn't do was the raspberries.

These were great! I tried one first and then decided to put the rest back in the oven but left those in a bit too long because they no longer had any lava in the centre but they were still delicious and fudgy. I even doubled the recipe and put them in ramekins and they were fine. This is a great recipe and I will definitly put them back in the oven next time. Delicious none the less!

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and everyone was very impressed.  Used ramekins instead of the muffin pan and was surprised at how quick and easy this was!  Will make it again, and may use milk chocolate next time to make it a little sweeter.

So good!! I made the batter and it set in the bowl on the counter for a few hours until it was time to serve dessert. I just poured into muffin tin and baked. Came out perfect!!!  Served with chocolate covered strawberries and dessert caramel, both recipes from this site.

I could never get the right crispy outside gooey inside ratio I was looking for, but the "unsatisfactory" ones were still so good I've been willing to experiment with times and temperatures in search of it.

These were heavenly - and soooooo easy!  I topped them with a homemade hotfudge sauce (2 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 c. butter, 2/3 c. chocolate chips, 1 can evaporated milk, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/8 c. orange liquor), whipped cream, and an orange slice (since raspberries weren't in season).  Delicioso!

These are awesome!! Just made these tonight using 4 oz ramekins, made them before dinner, stuck em in the fridge and put in the oven just as we were clearing dinner.  I was so excited about how good these were. I thought they looked a bit undone after 11 minutes so I left them in there an extra minute, which I shouldn't have.  Only the 1st one was really gooey inside. By the time I had the other ones out, they were setting. I will definitely be making these again, soo easy to make!! And so yummy!!

These are very good. Made them for a quick desert after a blah dinner. It made up for dinner! I will make again. I didn't have any raspberries so I served with a little bit of caramel sauce. Really good. Thanks.

Looks like a restaurant quality dessert and is super easy and delicious. Guests will think you slaved over dessert. Best when served with vanilla ice cream.

I served the molten cupcakes, so to speak, with orange sherbert. Very refreshing. Still have some experimenting to do with the baking, though. After 14 minutes, they finally began to puff up, but the centers were not fluid. Perhaps the two minutes between removing them from the oven and getting them to the table were two minutes too many for them to flow.

This was definitely not sweet enough for my taste. I added an extra 3 tbsp of Sugar to 1/2 of the batter in my second batch and they still weren't sweet enough!

Wow, can you say decadence or what? I made mine in 5 6-ounce ramekins that i greased. I also chilled my batter in the freezer for about 20 minutes in the ramekins. Took about twelve minutes, and then the tops got a little crackly, which was a good time to take them out. I turned them right away so they wouldn't stick. Served with whipped cream on top with a sprinkle of cocoa powder. Yummy!

This recipe is a favorite at our house and is often requested by my husband. I made it exactly as written, except I used bittersweet chocolate and baked it in ramekins rather than a muffin tin. We love putting fresh raspberries from our backyard on top along with some whipped cream. It's as good as any dessert I've ever had from a restaurant and extremely easy to make.

VERY VERY GOOD!! I used ramekins to better the presentation of the cake. Sprinkle it with confectioner's sugar, serve with fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream  .. and perfection will meet your mouth. Have made this again and again!

I've experimented with these a couple of times and am still having trouble getting the cooking time correct... they are either to done (no lava in center) or to gooey (mostly lava and no cake).  I'm going to keep trying to perfect this recipe... the flavor is awesome though.  I too used the Ghiradelli chocolate chips... I followed the recipe exactly as suggested.

These tasted really delicious and I served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. The only thing that threw me off (quite possibly my fault) was that I used 7 oz ramekins and it was seriously undercooked on my first try of getting a cake out. It basically exploded into a chocolate mess on my plate. For larger ones, I think they need like 14 minutes or so. Another thing I learned for next time is DON'T FILL THESE TO THE TOP...OR EVEN CLOSE TO THE TOP! :) They rise A LOT!!! Gooey chocolate oozed out of one before it had become to big for the ramekin. Also, let them cool for about 15 minutes or so before flipping out onto a place because they set-up even moreso after sitting out. I'll try to make again using the tips I learned from the first round. They tasted divine!

Sinfully decadent and elegant...perfect desert to serve company with little effort required (so easy too)!  I cut this recipe in half for only 4 of us and used individual ramekins (sprayed).  Used a 100g bar of good quality chocolate (70% cocoa) and 2 eggs.  Prepped them earlier in the afternoon and left in fridge and just took out while I was cleaning up.  Baked and voila, wonderful!  Will definitely make these again, thanks!

This is an excellent recipe! I did not change anything about it, and it turned out great! Everyone loved it. My sister is not a big fan of molten chocolate cake, and she said it was perfect. She prefers fudge cake. There were two leftover cakes that I put in the fridge. The next day they because fudge cakes! Not quite molten (obviously) but very very very fudgey and yummy! She ate 'em both!

This is delectable! I made this for my husband's birthday and even with a tummyache, he still inhaled one of these. :) I used milk chocolate chunks because I like my desserts really sweet and I took another reviewer's advice and splurged on the more expensive brand of chocolate (Guillard's, I think) which made the cakes that much more luxorious. I will be making this for every special occasion now -- thank you!

Very Good, and super easy. Would definitely follow others suggestions and make them in individual souffle dishes for a nicer presentation. If making in a cupcake pan, you must use liners, otherwise they are VERY difficult to remove without breaking apart, even if you use nonstick, and grease the pan they fall in on themselves due to the soft center.

These came out good. I didn't have cupcake/muffin paper holders, so I just used a muffin pan without the holders. Not a fan of rasberries, so I utilized the recipe on this site "Supreme Strawberry Topping".  If you use this topping recipe, you could customize it since you don't need so much topping on small muffins. I used about 10 strawberries, 1/8c sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Chopped the strawberries and mixed in sugar & vanilla. Heat in pot until strawberries are soft and syrup forms.

So sad. :( I made 12 regular sized muffins and cooked them for 9 minutes. Needless to say, they were not chocolate lava cupcakes but regular soft cupcakes. Next time, I might cook them fo 7 - 8 minutes and spray the muffin liners with PAM.

Very gourmet, especially considering how fast and easy they are.  Served them with whipping cream and regular raspberries rather than sugar-coated ones, which seemed to be a pretty good combination. Much better straight out of the oven than reheated in the microwave, though.

My centers were not molten, just a little gooey. I guess if you use regular muffin tins you should bake them for a lot less time. Even still, I won't be giving these a second shot because the flavor was more like an egg custard than any sort of fudge.

Awesome!  I followed the directions exactly and they were perfect. My recommendation, though, is to use larger cupcake tins or ramekins. Normal cupcake size are just too small, and be sure to take them out of the oven when they still look "raw" in the middle or you won't have the "molten" chocolate.  Thank you for the recipe!  P.S. It was SO easy!!!

wonderful! I baked them for exactly 8 min and they turned out amazing! They don't tell you how long to cool before serving-we cooled ours for 5 min before and they were perfect! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is I would recommend adding some vanilla, I will do that next time for a bit more flavor.

OH OH OH!  Cut to 4 eggs.  Used Ghirardelli.  1/2 bittersweet, 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate.  Put in XL muffin tin... so it made 6 huge ones.  Cooked 10 minutes.  Becuase they were sooo huge, I probably could have done 1 more minute, but regardless, it was a goo-ey, chocolately, heavenly dessert.  Difficult to get out of the tin... will keep working on it!

i am taking this rating from my children, as i have not eaten any.  (i'm still working on the mini cheesecakes from last night, lol)  my DH said it was a little grainy, and my DS said if he had some vanilla ice cream with it, it would be a 5!  No raspberries...but when the summer crop comes, i'll make this again to serve with them.

These were a big hit. I made them with a store brand dark chocolate bar. Next time I will make the batter and refrigerate until I am ready to bake them. I was in a hurry to find a quick dessert for company so I didn't read the reviews, only the rating. I didn't use raspberries but served them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

These are fabulous! Our whole family adores them! The only suggestion I would make is to cook them a little longer than what the recipe says.

Absolutely delicious! If you're using normal muffin cups, though, it makes about 14 servings (not 8). 
Next time I make it, I'll definitely have vanilla ice cream on hand! (Actually, I'm planning to make it for Thanksgiving dessert.)
I also plan on trying different toppings: caramelized bananas, walnuts, cherries, whipped cream... the possibilities are endless and they all sound so good!
Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this every time we have guests because it is so simple and elegant.  I usually serve with a good quality ice cream when I don't have raspberries in the house.  It is more popular with the ice cream - how easy for me!

Perfect!! I have been wanting to make a chocolate lava cake for the longest time, but all of the recipes sounded so complicated.  I found this one yesterday and had to try it last night.  They were amazing and so easy!  My husband would have no problem eating them every night!  I didn't change anything, except to make them in little ceramic cups.  Take them out as soon as the edges puff up and the middle doesn't and-Perfection!  I am going to serve them with vanilla ice cream next, mmmm!

As recommended by others, I refrigerated the batter for several hours before baking the cakes. But other than this one minor change, I followed the recipe exactly as written. The cakes turned out wonderfully gooey and had an intense chocolate flavor. Presentation-wise, the cakes would probably look better if they were made in ramekins instead of muffin cups. But in terms of taste, they're delicious either way! I served them with a dollop of whipped cream. They would be fantastic with vanilla ice cream, too.

I used 4 XL eggs and omitted the raspberry part.  This dessert is to die for!  The tin foil baking cups worked the best, the cakes held their shape better.  Mine yielded 9 cakes.  I would love to give this recipe 10 stars, its that good!

These are amazing - incredibly easy to make, yet the result is very gourmet!  I had to use milk chocolate chips and salted butter since those were the ingredients I had on hand, but it still turned out wonderfully.  I saved one of the finished cakes in the fridge overnight and it was even delicious to eat cold the next day.  I plan to wow a lot of people with this recipe in the future!

These were delicious!  I always believed these to be difficult to make, but they couldn't be more easy.  I used 4 eggs instead of 5, and used ramekins, filled about 1/2" from the top, and baked for 11 minutes.  Next time I will bake for 12 minutes, and I think they will be perfect.  I had leftovers that I refrigerated, then reheated in the microwave, and they were just as delicious.

This is a good and very easy recipe, but I think the chocolate flavor is lacking.  Using good quality chocolate helps, also adding 3-4 tbs of cocoa powder helps.  I just made a new recipe from Cooks Illustrated for molten cakes that is much, much better.

I was so excited to try this recipe. Unfortunately I was quite disapointed. They looked and smelled great...But the taste was overall too 'eggy'. I think I may have cooked them too long?????\ I don't think i will try these again.

Super easy recipe!  I used regular butter and omitted the pinch of salt. I accidentally over baked them a little  and they ended up having a torte-like texture inside.  Still great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I loved this recipe!  I made them in regular muffin-size liners, since those are what I had on hand and they were the PERFECT size.  Spraying the liners w/ cooking spray is so key and makes getting them out so easy.  I had plenty leftover after the hubby & I enjoyed a serving of these - enough to share with some friends who stopped by to visit.  Rave reviews all around!

Very delicious, just as good as those you find at fancy restaurants. Easy to make, first time though didn't have extra large muffin paper so just used the muffin tin...not so easy coming out, kind of just fell apart.  Second time used silicone texas muffin liners and went full 10-11 minutes, worked like a charm! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was easy to make and ideal for entertaining when you have several complicated dishes to make.  I made it the night before and popped it in the oven at the end of our anniversary dinner.  For plating I served it upside down with a little powdered sugar and drizzled a pattern of batter on the plate around the cake.  My husband thought it looked like a simple and classic that way.

I tried these a while back, I thought they were really nice, but VERY hard to get out of the pans...yes pans..I tried using teflon pan, silicon pan, when you try to remove one they all come out..husband was not fussy on these, but he is not a dark chocolate fan. I have since bought ramekins so will use those and will not worry about getting them out, I will use this recipe again

I am definitely a chocolate girl, and I loved these.  I made 12 of them in a muffin tin.  I took some to my neighbors and when I got back, I noticed my teenage son, who usually doesn't go crazy for desserts, had eaten three of them.  I think these are as good as the fancy restaurants serve.  It's all in the presentation.  Thanks so much for a wonderful receipe!

Oh goodness, have you had your chocolate fix today? If not, this is it!This decadent dessert can be whipped up in minutes and is the perfect ending to any meal. Hubby thought it was a little too rich-I didn't know that was possible! LOL

Delicious!  Like chocolate heaven.  I used 4 oz. ramekins and baked until the tops cracked (about 12 minutes).  The middles weren't as "molten" as I would have liked, but delicious none the less.

Oh yeah, this is good and very easy!  I thought it didn't sound like enough flour, but it was.  I made a half recipe which made 3 small Ramekins, similar to another reviewer who made 6 with a full recipe.  Great with a side of Vanilla Bean ice cream and strawberries!  I will definitely make this again for guests (and for me).

i served this at a dinner party i hosted and it was the perfect ending to a rather formal affair.  it is a quick bake, after you have the batter combined and i like the fact that the batter can be prepared way ahead of time.  They are rich and decadent.

They are a bit too runny for my taste but when put in the freezer for a few minutes, are just perfect!  The taste was excellent!

These were great! I was, however, worried about how liquid the centers were because they seemed undercooked. Everyone loved these!! I just had to add that i made these for the second time in 3 days today! My family loves them!
