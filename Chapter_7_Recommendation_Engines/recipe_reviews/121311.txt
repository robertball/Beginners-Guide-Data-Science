I've made this 3 times in the last month using a chocolate crust, oreo crust and a pastry pie crust. They were all great,quick to make and perfect for pulling out of the freezer when company arrived. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and fat free evaporated milk. Need more chocolate? Increase the cocoa a couple of teaspoons. Thank you for a teffific recipe!!!

Off the hook. Literally. We loved this pie. I used a large carton frozen whipped topping and I spooned some into a ziploc bag that I'd snipped the end off of and fitted a tip through the hole and I made pretty piping on the around the outside of the pie. My husband has already eaten a third of the pie. He loved it--we all did!

This is an awesome dessert pie.  Made it for Thanksgiving for friends who do not like traditional holiday pies.   It is super easy to make.  It tastes like the liquid at the bottom of a sundae bowl.   To decorate the top of the pie, I put the chocolate syrup into a ziploc bag, cut the tip off and piped criss-cross lines across the top of it.

This recipe is a keeper!  I have made several times and it is a big hit.  It is creamy and chocolatey without being too rich.  Try it and you won't regret it!

This was so quick and easy and everyone had a fit over it.  Tasted like chocolate velvet. I added a thin layer of Cool Whip on top and drizzled chocolate and caramel syrup over.

With a pastry bag and a little imagination, it can look store-bought
