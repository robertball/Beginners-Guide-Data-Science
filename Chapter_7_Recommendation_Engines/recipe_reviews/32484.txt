YUM! I absolutely love frozen coffee drinks, but being pregnant, I can't drink the ones from Dunkin Donuts or Tim Horton's since they contain so much caffeine, and the $4 at Starbucks are too pricey and several miles away. SO...I found this great recipe and it tastes great! Just like the ones in the cafes. Thank you, Susan! This is great.

Mmmmmm. This could become a very bad habit!  The idea of cold coffee never appealed to me but since I recently made a coffee ice cream and found I loved it I guessed I'd like this Cappuccino Cooler too.  Hubs had his made with espresso, and I with my regular brew and we were both happy with our after dinner "coffee and ice cream." Great name for a great drink.

I used Breyers Slow Churn low-fat chocolate ice cream(Thank you, Hungry Girl!)and reduced fat/low sugar chocolate syrup. This was heaven. Pretty close to those Big Train blended drinks from my favorite coffee stand. I made one with Breyers Slow Churned Cookies and Cream and chocolate syrup for my husband and he loved it. This one's a keeper. NOTE: Next time, I might use frozen yogurt, to bring the calories/fat content down just a bit more.

This is really good. With all the goodness used to make this yummy drink, I think it took away alot of the coffee flavor, so it's best to use strong coffee. A definite 5 star!!!!

Perfect! I was looking for something quick and easy to make as a pick me up after a long night and early morning and this was it! I used vanilla frozen yogurt and added a bit of caramel to the mix. Perfect

My husband and I love iced coffee and are willing to spend a bit for it when we go out.  This surpasses what we've tried so far.  Whipping cream and chocolate shavings on top are a must.

This was fast and easy to make! I don't like to 'taste' the ice. Even though its crushed I put it in the blender with the other ingredients. If guests are over and you don't really want to make a coffee run this is perfect!

This is very good coffee drink! I love iced coffee drinks and this is so delicious! I used my own homemade chocolate ice cream and Kahlua coffee liqueur, because chocolate syrup is too strong for me.

Used Blue Bunny Home-made Chocolate ice cream and Hershey's Hot Fudge with Alterra Hazelnut Coffee (Wisconsin local).  Perfecto!

I liked this MUCH better than the Iced Mocha recipe. To make it lower in fat though I did freeze my coffee and only put 2 Tblsp of ice cream and extra ice cubes.(I prefer mine a little on the THICK side) .Won't be wasting time & money driving thru McDonald's for Frappe's when I can make them this good.  Thanks a million.

This drink was every bit as good as the ones I've purchased at Starbuck's or Gloria Jeans. Very easy, very cheap; and no lines or crowds.

Made these at the request of my young son, WOW! These are delicious, and was everything we were looking for.  They were thick, rich, creamy and chocolately.  Added some espresso powder for a bit stronger coffee flavor.  We topped them off with extra creamy Redi-Whip and drizzled some more chocolate syrup over that.  May try including the ice in the blender next time to get that slush effect, other than that, wouldn't change anything.

I am hooked on this stuff and am so thankful to you for this quick and easy recipe.  I add a heaping teaspoon of decalf instant coffee for a stronger coffee taste.  Just reviewing this makes me want to go make one right now.

This was excellent! The only ice cream I had on hand was vanilla fudge swirl, but it turned out just great! I also blended the ice cubes in with the rest of it to make more of a frozen coffee than an iced one. I will definitely use this again!

This was pretty good, but we definitely preffered the "cocoa coffee milkshake" also on this site.
