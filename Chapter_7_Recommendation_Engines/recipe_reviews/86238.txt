I love Coconut Curry and this recipe is worth a try. There is a few things I added to make it more flavorful and spicey. Add 1 tsp minced ginger, 1 tsp chili powder, and 1/4 tsp cayenne powder. Also, include your favorite vegetables like bamboo shoots, green beans, or peas. You'll love this dish!

I made this recipe tonight for 2 as it is only me that I am cooking for.  I did everything the same as the recipe except for adding a few raisins and some ginger and brown sugar as someone below suggested.  This is just wonderful and just what I wanted.  I have a second thigh to take to work for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I thought it was missing a few things.  Added some Curry Paste as well as curry powder.  Also added brown sugar and ginger.  Much better after the additions.

Wow !!! yday was the first time I cooked for a group of 15 ppl and this recipe is what saved me. Very simple to put together and it did come out really tasty. I did reduce the amount of oil I used to make it a little more healthy and it came out just fine. Thankyou for this amazing recipe, I will surely make it again :-)

I really liked this recipe, it was my first attempt at anything curry. I ended up adding much more than 5 tbsp of the curry sauce because I tasted it and thought it was wonderful and wanted more! (I bought a jar of 11oz Thai Kitchen yellow curry and used about half of it!) I also added snap peas and minced ginger, like suggested by others, to the veggie mix. Anyway, this is a keeper for me and my boyfriend who loved it as well; and I am so happy to have been introduced to cooking asian/indian style food without it being disastrous!

It was good, it really helps to put ginger in this. I couldnt find chicken thighs (since I was shopping in a hurry!) so I used chicken breast instead.

This was very easy to make and everyone ate everything on their plate! I couldn't find the curry paste in the store so I used powder instead(only 3tbls)and I also added pinapple,garbanzo beans and cayenne pepper(1tbls). It came out great.

Mmmm Mmmm Yum! This recipe beats my favorite Chinese restaurant version. Now I can make it myself. Just take the advice of some of the other reviewers by adjusting spices (Curry Powder) to your liking and add fresh ginger and you are in business.

This recipes was so delicious. The only thing I did differently was season the chicken before hand with soul food seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper. It was delicious!!! I also made some rice which I boiled in the extra coconut milk. It was a Dream, and very easy to make.

This really was goof proof. I made this for the fam and it didn't go over very well, but what do you expect with a meat and tater man and a 7 year old. This would be a staple if other people in my household were more adventurous.

I used chicken breast and doubled the recipe.  I also used fresh garlic to fry/cook the chicken.  Instead of curry sauce (did not have it), I made a paste of 1/2 tsp chili powder, 2 tsp corriander powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, and 1 tsp garam masala.  Also used chicken broth instead of water.   Would make again, but will marinate the chicken next time in some spices.

This was the first time I made a curry so I liked that it was not over comlicated and was a good base. I doubled the recipe and also added some veggies (carrots, peas & bamboo shoots) The original recipe would have scored higher had it had some of these additions. On a sidse note the curry sauce I bought was very bland (kikkomon brand, thai yellow curry sauce) I won't be buying it again. It was hot but otherwise had very little flavor, I added a lot of salt and some curry powder to make up for it. I'll be making this again and playing around with it.

The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because I made a few changes. I used a whole can of coconut milk and only used water to mix with the cornstarch. I didn't have curry sauce so I used about 3 tbls. of curry powder. I also used about 2 tbls. of red chili paste. I also threw in some minced garlic and ginger, along with some cilantro and about 1 tbls. of brown sugar. It was delicious!!

I made this recipe for me and my boyfriend tonight and it was a big hit! I altered it to my personal tastes a bit, using a chicken steak instead of thighs, a red bell pepper instead of green, and chopped up a bundle of green onions to use in lieu of a regular onion. I'm just starting to experiment with curry dishes, and used 2 sections (cubes? rectangles?) of Golden Curry sauce mix (found in the asian section at the supermarket). I also seasoned my chicken as I cooked it with black pepper, cayenne, ginger, and a smidgen of chili powder. I used the leftover coconut milk mixed with water to make rice.  So tasty! I'll make this recipe again and again!

Yummy! ok so I made some modifications... first I bought chicken breast in stead of thighs, I used about 1.75 lbs. I was not able to find already made curry sauce so I bought a box of S&B Golden Curry Sauce Mix (medium hot) at the international market. Since the sauce mix was concentrated I added 1 1/2 cups water and 1 cup coconut milk. I used a sweet potato instead of a regular potato cause I had one on hand and added a bag of frozen "california style vegetables" from Safeway (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower).  And I served it over jasmine ride ... It is YUMMY!

I did not care for this recipe. It could be the curry paste I used but it wasn't very good at all. I'd rather go back to adding my own curry powder.

This was my first time making curry, and it came out really good! I stuck to the recipe exactly, but tripled it. Ended up using 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. I have to say, it was a bit time consuming deboning, trimming, and cutting up the chicken. I think it was worth it though, 'cause you get a deeper flavour from the thighs as compared to chicken breasts. As I was making it, it looked like way to much bell pepper- I used 3 , but it ended up being perfect. Served it with Brown rice that was cooked with half of the water replaced by coconut milk. The coconut milk made the rice deliciously creamy, and brought out the nuttiness of the brown rice. The only thing I would change was adding the 3/4 cup of water, and the corn starch water at the end. It didn't make sense to me to dilute the curry, then add a thickener. I tasted the dish after adding the curry sauce/paste and coconut milk (I used green curry paste) and it was perfectly flavoured.The consistency was perfect, too.  After I added the water, it tasted diluted. If it wasn't for that, though, I probably would give this 5 stars- it was yummy!

Well this would have been even better had I: used curry Sauce-not curry Paste-lord that was hot! oops! yams/sweet potatoes are a natural in this dish, and yes, definitely add sugar. i added white sugar. mmm it was good......  EDIT: Okay, made this again, just like the recipe listed. Added sugar, but not sweet potatoes.  Found it alright this time, but kinda boring. Might not make again.

I didn’t care for this at all.  It was missing something, I added ginger, Garam Masala, curry powder in addition to curry paste (I couldn’t find curry sauce), cumin.  It still tasted kind of flat (for lack a a better description)

I used creme de cacao instead of coconut milk because that's what I had. Like another reviewer suggested, I added come cayenne pepper to make it more spicy. While it did help, I still wish it was more spicy for my tastes. It came across as sweet as me. Maybe it's because of the curry sauce I used? It was also thinner than I wanted the consistency to be and I would put in less water. Other than that, it was super tasty and filling. Just not the best curry out there if you prefer spicy ones.

Very good dish especially for those who like some spice. My variation was to make my own curry sauce rather than buying as well as using vanilla yogurt rather than plain.

First time trying a recipe like this,  but so glad I did. My family loved it. I did use breasts instead of thighs, and added fresh ginger and curry as recommended by others. Made fried rice to go with it. Yummy!

I will try and make, but the ingredient "curry sauce " is vague. Is this pre packaged? Who makes it. Where do I get it?

I'm not a great cook and this turned out really good.  I had it with Jasmine rice.  I'm impressed.  I added 2 teaspoons of brown sugar as someone suggested.
