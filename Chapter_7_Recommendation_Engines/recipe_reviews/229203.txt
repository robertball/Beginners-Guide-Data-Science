Delicious! I used sun dried tomato pesto sauce, sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and as a side had some garlic texas toast. Very filling despite it being a vegetarian style dish. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I added feta cheese, and a little mayonnaise and mustard to make it a little creamier.

I really enjoyed this recipe and how simple it was! it was a little dry for me so I added Italian dressing which made it pop a bit and gave it a little more moisture but overall I will definitely make this again!

I cut down the amount of pesto and added some mayo to make the pesto creamier. Oh...I added some cooked chicken too. OMG...it was awesome! Roasting the veggies really brought out the favors.

So good!  The only thing I added was a little Italian seasoning on the veggies.  So much flavor!
