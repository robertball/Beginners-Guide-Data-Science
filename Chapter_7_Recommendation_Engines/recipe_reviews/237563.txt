These pickled onions are FANTASTIC-- I have yet to try them with a Bloody Mary, but they make a nice accompaniment to an ordinary sandwich. I've already scarfed down half a jar by myself, and they only finished pickling yesterday. For a first-time canner, the directions were really helpful as well!

We thought these might get slimy in the jar, but ours were nice and crisp -- and very oniony! If you have onions in your garden, this is perfect to make with the thinnings (the onions you pull out to thin the patch).
