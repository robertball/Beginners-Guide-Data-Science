I nominated this recipe for the Recipe Group this week and it was selected.  I nominated it for it’s simplicity and ease of preparation.  However, as I began making it I realized that it was going to need a little help or it would be bland.  I did make some adjustments along the way.  I sautéed 1/2 cup of onion and then added the garlic.  I used two cans rather than three of the chicken broth and one can of Rotel tomatoes.  In hindsight I should have added a second can of Rotel for a little more flavor.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen and sprinkled parmesan cheese on just before serving.  This was good and we enjoyed it, but I do think the original recipe needs a boost in flavor.

Mmmmmm. I added a can of black beans, drained; and one zucchini, quartered and thinly sliced. I also used the dry tortellini from Sam's. YUMMY.

I made this as the Recipe Buzz Group Recipe for the week of Sep. 20th. This soup is terrific. It's simple and delicious. I used the dried Barilla spinach & ricotta flavor tortellini, 16 oz; I used fresh raw spinach, wilting it at the end; and 1 extra cup of chicken broth. I did not need Parmesan as a topper; my tortellini are flavorful enough. (I find that all frozen tortellini are bland, while the Barilla dried kind are always flavorful, personally.) The key to the flavor in this recipe is going to be your broth, so if the broth alone doesn't taste good -- your soup won't, either, so make sure you use broth that you know is tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy. But I do agree that Parmesan cheese should be listed as an ingredient, because it definately makes the soup.

I was a bit skeptical after reading the recipe but all I can say is you should try this one. Wow is this good!! The only thing I changed is added extra chicken boullion cubes, like more chicken flavor. The family loved this soup and is super easy and quick to whip up. Thanks for the great recipe.

Better than I expected given the limited ingredients!  I doubled the recipe and used 10 oz. of spinach and 10 oz. of sliced fresh zucchini.  It does need the sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top, so I think this should be listed as an ingredient.

I made this for Recipe Group and give it 4 stars for quick and easy.  It was just ok for me, but then again, I am not a huge spinach fan.  I did like the spicy taste that the Rotel tomatoes gave it.

I used fresh kale instead of spinach and fire roasted diced tomatoes.  This is such a yummy, EASY recipe that is ready in minutes!  I did not use the butter at all.  Delicious cold weather meal in minutes:)

WOW!  Fantastic!  I cannot rave enough about this simple but fabulous soup.  My husband and I ate it till we were sick (that's a huge compliment, by the way). I only added salt and pepper.  It's restaurant quality for sure!  Thanks for this recipe. I will be passing it on.

I made this for Recipe Group and we LOVED it! I can't believe how simple this was, yet so flavorful. This literally took me 10 minutes to make. I did make a mistake though, I thought I picked up the tomatoes w/ green chilis at the store, but I accidentally grabbed tomatoes w/ onions, but no matter, it was still fantastic and I will definately try it the right way next time. This will definately be on my menu often! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was absolutely delicious! Love the fact that it's so quick, easy, and healthy (I used whole wheat tortellini and fat free chicken broth so it was healthier)! I don't think it needs parmesan on top, the cheese in the tortellini is definitely enough!

I started with homemade chicken stock so flavor wasn't an issue.  I used fresh spinach and spinach tortellini.  The tomatoes with jalapenos were a wonderful addition.  I sprinkled fresh grated Asiago cheese and freshly ground black pepper on each dish as I served it.  This will be served again now that the weather is getting cooler.  Thanks, Donna, this is a keeper.

Very tasty - I added 1/2 lb of browned italian sausage and thickened the broth with corn starch.

Very tasty.  I too used dry tortellini from trader joes (12 oz bag).  It was too much once cooked/expanded.  Probably half the bag  (6 oz) would've been fine.  I didn't thaw and squeeze the frozen spinach either.  Basically, I did 2 steps.  Sautéed garlic in butter. Added remaining ingredients. Let it boil then simmer until dried pasta is cooked (25 min).

My new favorite soup! I flavored the stock with oregano, parsley and a bay leaf, which I let simmer for an hour before serving with the tortellini (sausage filled).  Sprinkled fresh parmesan on top and served with crusty bread.

Super fast and easy. Even my son said he'd love to have it for dinner again. I put a decent amount of parmigiano reggiano cheese on top when serving and the soup was a hit!

I was a tad skeptical about this recipe and even while making it I didn't want to taste it, because I thought it wouldn't work.  Boy, was I wrong!  I can't believe something so simple could taste so wonderful. The flavors were just pure and simple that there is no reason to add anything to this soup. I did use fresh spinach, only because that's what I had on hand, but next time I would not hesitate to use frozen.  This soup is definitely going on my regular rotation when I need a quick, easy and satisfying meal.

I was on a mission to try to replicate the tortellini soup made by a family friend who owns an Italian restaurant in my home town.  He would NOT give me his recipe despite my begs and pleas!!

Tried several different recipe's before stumbling across this one.  It is not exactly the same as his recipe, but it is very close!  To be honest, I think I like this recipe BETTER than his!!!  :-)

This was really good. I liked the spinach. I left out the tomatoes and added chicken breast meat to the soup. I also added green onions. Thanks for the post.

This recipe was good and very simple, which makes it a great weeknight meal when you don't have much time to prepare something more elaborate. The flavor was pretty good, but I could see how some people would think that it is bland, and the suggestions that some other reviewers have made would make this soup even better. I might try those next time I make this. My husband, my six year old, one year old, and I all liked it, and the only complaint was from my three year old. He ended up eating it though. Great, quick recipe. Thank you for sharing, Donna!

This recipe as written is pretty bland. I added garlic powder, ample salt, pepper, parsley, oregano and a chicken bouillon cube. I didn't add the full 10 oz. of spinach, and I felt it was still too much. I added some ham cubes for flavor. The green chilies definitely added some heat - my 10 year old wasn't too crazy about that, but I like spicy foods. The original recipe is good to build on and I will likely make again with some minor tweaks.

Good recipe to start with, but it does need some adjustments for more flavor. I did saute some onion as other reviewers did, and I did use fire roasted tomatoes and fresh green chilies. Finished it off with some pecorino that needed to be used up and enjoyed it very much with some crusty bread. Quick and easy for sure, just make some adjustments to avoid blandness.

This was super-easy, but needs salt for a boost of flavor.  The cheese is also a must.
