This was really good. I would never have thought of pairing pork with pesto, and now I have no idea why. Instead of putting the bacon in the stuffing, I wrapped the roast in bacon just to make it more moist.

So delicious! Don’t change a thing! I left the breast whole, butterflied it and then pounded it. I sliced it to serve. So pretty! I used the recipe for Creamy Philly pesto sauce for our pasta. It went so well together. I never thought I liked pesto til now!

This is a great recipe with a lot of flavor, we loved it! The sauce really does kick it up to the next level. I’ve never made a stuffed pork tenderloin, or a stuffed anything, and there is a learning curve to getting it to look nice. I learned that you do want to pound it and get it as thin as possible to roll up nice! Mine wouldn’t win any beauty contest, but it sure was delicious.
