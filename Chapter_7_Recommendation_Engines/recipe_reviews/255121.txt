I added spices to the tomato sauce (salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder) and used Ground Sirloin for the meat.  I also added 1/3 cup breadcrumbs to the meat and 2 eggs because it seemed too dry.  I cooked the meatballs in Lite Tasting Olive Oil in a skillet.  It turned out great!  I mixed the Zucchini noodles from Ralphs  with some Angel Hair Pasta (1/2 and 1/2). I put fresh Parmesan Cheese grated on
top.  Yummy!!!

This turned out to be a quick and easy lunch. Everything was ready in about 30 minutes from the very beginning. I was afraid the meatballs wouldn't hold up without any binders. They were sturdy enough while baking but tended to fall apart when transfering them to the sauce. So, next time, I'll add an egg yolk. I think most people will think this dish is a bit bland, but for us, it was really nice. My husband gave it 5 stars, but this is after I had added Parmigiano Reggiano and hot peppers. Definitely not the last time I make this. Thank you for the recipe.
