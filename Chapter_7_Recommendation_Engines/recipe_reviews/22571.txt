We are BIG pumpkin pie fans so i wasn't too excited about this recipe. However, my fondness for trying new dishes took over and i was very pleased with the results. It was very,very easy to make and so delicious, I will definitely make it many times again.

This has been a BIG hit with my family of 12 over the past 10 years. It's a good alternative to pumpkin pie and it's delicious!! My family continues to request it year after year...highly recommended.

I typically make things from scratch, but was given a box of food that included a cake mix, so I tried this recipe.  We all like it a lot, though I prefer pumpkin harvest bars made from scratch a bit better.  Still, when you're in a pinch time-wise, this is a great dessert to serve!

Very good, nice and moist.  I threw in some sliced blanched almonds instead of the walnuts and tossed in about 1/2 cup of raisins.  Only used 1/2 teaspoon cloves, I think a whole 1 would be overwhelming.  Also don't be afraid to stir the batter fully, you will have clumps of flour otherwise...Iced with Orange Cream Frosting from this site it looked like a pumpkin, too.

I really like this one!  I actually used another recipe on this site called Mrs. Sigg's Fresh Pumpkin Pie to make the pumpkin filling, and then I topped it with the cake mix according to this recipe.  I had fresh pumpkin and didn't know how to use it!  It turned out more delicious than words can describe!

This is very rich and makes a good sized cake.  I used sliced pecans and pumpkin pie spices and it was delicious! Not for the diet crowd!!

Tastes great & easy to make! I made this for a group of friends & even those people not crazy about pumpkin loved it. I didn't have canned evaporated milk so I made my own by boiling 2 cups of milk on a saucepan til there was 1 cup of milk.

This was wonderful.  I made it in a tube pan and iced it with cream cheese frosting.  Like pumpkin pie - only better.

I found it necessary to increase sugar to 1 cup.  It could have used a little more spice.  But more importantly, it could not be removed from the pan.  An ingredient may be missing, maybe a little flour, to make it stiffer so it could be served in squares, rather than as a lump on the plate.

This is really good, just be sure to use an 9x13 dish, anything smaller doesn't work as well. We don't do pumpkin pie anymore, we do this.

this is not a cake, nor is it a pie. It is absolutely delicious. I had to give half of it away to keep from eating the whole thing

This was easy to prepare and very delicious.  I will definitely make again.  Make sure when drizzling butter to cover all of the cake mix.  Also I chopped up the pecans as it didn't say but I will just cover with half pecans next time.
