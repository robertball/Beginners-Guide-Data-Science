I honestly have to say this was the worst recipe for a vinagrette i've ever seen....the balance of oil to vinegar is completely! i tried it just for the hell of it and as i thought...... you need at least 1/4-1/3 cup vinegar.

This vinaigrette came out tasting VERY olive-oily: nothing like a vinaigrette.  It was thick like a ranch dressing, but without any flavor other than olive oil.

This is the first dressing I've ever made.  Tried it last night to pour over a salad with candied almonds, oranges and strawberry flavored dried cranberries.  After reading some of the reviews, I altered the recipe a bit.  I made the ratio of oil to vinegar 3:1 (Joy of Cooking) and added 2 TB of honey to delay the separation of the emulsified ingredients.  It did not turn out very liquid; more like a dressing than a vinaigrette, but man was it delicious.  It got 12 thumbs up among our party of 6.  Five stars with the corrected ratios.

Excellent and simple.  I adjusted the recipe to make it even easier. I chopped a pint of strawberries, added 2 packets of sweet and low and a little water.  Let it soak over night and served it on a bed of baby leaf spinach. It was delicious. My non-vegetable eating boyfriend even loved it!

Very good!  I pureed frozen strawberries and added much more balsamic (too much olive oil taste) and omitted the spices with the exception of black pepper.  Delicious!

This was a little thick for a vin.  i added my own stuff to it to make it more like salad dressing and less like a puree.

This is a great dressing!  I added in a tiny bit of sugar since we like our fruity dressings a little bit sweet, and had to omit the tarragon (I didn't have any).  Yum!

This comes close to great. I'll be happy to share this recipe with my little changes. Strawberries make this vinaigrette thick and creamy, with just a delicate flavor of the strawberry. There is not enough vinegar for this to be a classic vinaigrette dressing. That being my desire, I added 3 Tbsp tarragon white wine vinegar since I didn't want it to be overpowered by so much balsamic. Other than that, the only other change I made was to use 1/2 as much salt. Make certain you use extra virgin olive oil or else the result may end to oily.  In the end it was a lightly flavored dressing that went very well on a tossed Spring salad, everyone at the adult table was very pleased.

This dressing tastes quite good. I had this over a steak, walnut, and pear salad and it went very well. I think it would taste good over a salad with apples as well.

The blue cheese really makes this dish.  It's bite offsets the sweetness of the vinagrette.  A very innovative combination!

I wanted to review this because I disagree with the horrible reviews.  I also wondered about the amount of vinegar, but I thought the amount of balsamic was perfect because you don't want to overpower the strawberry flavor.  I did use canola oil instead of olive oil because I didn't want the stronger flavor of olive oil coming through.  I also added 2 T. sugar after tasting.  I did not find the texture to be too thick - I think this may depend on your strawberries.  I used very soft, juicy local berries.  Not those hard California berries you buy at the market.  I think this really made the difference in making a very good dressing.

My family loved this recipe.  I did tweak it a little though.  I added strawberries to taste, added one small shallot, replaced the sugar with honey, reduced the olive oil by half and used red wine vineger instead of Balsamic.  Delicious!

This is pretty good!  I have no idea if the proportions are right.  I only had 4 strawberries so I basically just blended those up in the food processor and then added everything else until the proportions looked right.  I tend to use a LOT less oil in my dressings than recipes call for so I probably didn't quite get the same proportion on that one.  Anyway, I used the dressing for a lettuce/apple/walnut/brie/red onion salad and it was very good!  Oh I also added some cilantro to the dressing because I had some on hand that I needed to get rid of, and that was a tasty addition.

WAY too much olive oil. This  makes a huge batch too. Added 3x as much sugar and a little organic strawberry spread to add some flavor as I found it bland on its own. With the additions, it was pretty tasty but I have SO much left over.

I didn't care for this recipe. The dressing tastes and smells of pure olive oil. I couldn't even use it. This recipe needs to be altered, I believe it calls for too much olive oil.

Didn't care for this vinaigrette - it had a funny taste to it for me.  Maybe I did something wrong in following the recipe but it was a bit bitter and had a strange taste to me.

I did take some other reviewers advise and cut back on the olive oil and added a few extra tweaks for my taste. I used 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup of the vinegar. I had a strawberry vinegar on hand so I used half it and half balsamic. My strawberries were very sweet naturally so I added the 1 TBSP honey and no extra sugar. Left out the tarragon and added 1 tsp poppy seeds. Very Good!

If you follow the recipe it is almost paste like or ranch like in consistency. Not a vinaigrette. It was very oily. I added a lot more vinegar and more pepper to make it decent. I will not use this recipe again.

I followed this recipe to the T and it was horrible... really bitter and just not a good flavor at all. i thought maybe some how something got switched and there was supposed to be a cup of balsamic vinegar and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. i don't know but i was so disappointed.

This was not good. The whole mess was really foamy, and had WAY too much oil and not near enough vinegar.  I would Wisk the ingredients instead of using a processor.

I also thought this was too thick, and ended up adding quite a bit more olive oil. I made it with white balsamic vinegar, and also used a little less tarragon as I am not very keen on it. We had this with a spinach leaf and goat cheese salad - very good. Thanks!

This was ok. Used less oil as per the advise of other reviewers. Would eliminate the sugar, strawberries are sweet enough and I found this too sweet. Also could have used more balsalmic.

This was not a good recipe at all. Too thick. Balsamic vinegar was not good. I redid it with cider vinegar and other changes.

This recipe was good once I played with it a bit. I used less EVOO and more vinegar. I added a little bit of red wine vinegar too and it turned out delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly and we found it to be delicious but definitely thicker than I imagined.  I would have enjoyed more strawberries and next time I will probably decrease the amount of olive oil and increase the balsamic because although it was a good taste, I did find it to be a strong olive oil flavor.

I loved this salad dressing. Super easy to make! I used mixed greens, bell pepper, cucumber, heirloom tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese & some croutons and tossed in the dressing. YUM!

The balance between the oil and vinegar was heavy on the oil side. I had to tweak this dressing to make it edible.

This turned out great for me although I did make some changes based on other reviews. I only did 1/2 cup of olive oil and I did a 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar. I added 2 tsp of white sugar and forgot to put the salt in and it turned out pretty tasty! I will likely make this again.

I agree with others about the amount of oil. I used  a 1/2 cup and three tablespoons of vinegar and it was still too much.

Sorry, but I didn't like this recipe!  Will never use again.  I'll continue to purchase pre-pkg salad with strawberry dressing included.

I made this for Easter dinner for my entire family.  Two biggest critics are my husband and my mother.  Both loved it...especially my mother!  Went strawberry picking day before and kids picked about 10 pounds of berries!  Had to come up with a million ways to use them...this being one of them.  Worried it would be too berry tasting...but kept it subtle and awesome!  Would make more again and again...Thanks!!!!

Not a Vinaigrette at all.  More like a Strawberry Ranch.  I did not like it at all.

I too found this to be a little thick for a vinaigrette.  The taste was too creamy for what I was expecting - it had a kind of richness or fullness that I can't describe as other than 'buttery' in flavor or smell...that may not be the correct word.  It was almost kinda like a strawberry smoothie with olive oil in it.  Bummer, because I was really hoping this would work, too!  Hope future reviewers find success w/this one

This dressing is wonderful.  It is not too thick; the texture is such that instead of falling the bottom of your salad bowl (blech), it clings like it should.  Thanks!

There are mixed reviews on this.  I tasted the dressing after mixing it and found it quite thick and very strawberry-strong.  But then we had it on our spinach, strawberry, and feta cheese salad and it tasted a lot better.
