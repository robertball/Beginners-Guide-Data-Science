These wings were great - but I cooked them at 375 for 25 minutes on each side based on prior chicken wing experience!  I served them cold at a party - but they had more lime flavor when they were hot.

YUM!  This was an excellent marinade that could be used on any piece of chicken.  My picky husband was raving about it, and he doesn't like too many new meals.  

The ingredients were a little on the expensive side, but now that I know it's going to be a regular meal, I'm glad I stocked up.  Excellent Recipe - Thanks Tyson
