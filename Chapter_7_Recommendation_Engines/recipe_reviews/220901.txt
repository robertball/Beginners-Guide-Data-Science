This is the best recipe!  I had never used cheese grits in my shrimp and grits and I love it this way!  I lightened it up a bit with lowfat cheese, chicken andouille sausage and 1 % milk.  Delicious!

Absolutely AMAZING! After my husband ordered a similar meal at a local restaurant, I went on the hunt for a recipe and found this one. It turned out head and shoulders better than the one for which we paid $11. I did make a few variations only because I was working with ingredients on hand, but I think that is just a testimony to how firm a foundation this recipe is in that it allows for wiggle room. My point being that I didn't make changes to "make it better" - I simply think this recipe is so good it allows room for them.
I skipped the jalapeno and celery, and used sundried tomatoes instead of fire-roasted, as well as a bouillon cube instead of soup base paste. Also, I am embarrassed to say that I was out of Cajun seasoning (I ALWAYS have it, so didn't check), but the flavor of the andouille sausage more than made up for the lack, so don't let that stop you. Oh, and I used quick grits rather than regular because, well, I always do! With the milk and cheese, they were divinely creamy.  
I know it is supposed to serve 8, but 4 adults had no problem polishing it off. Did I mention how good this is? Yeah, that might have had something to do with how much we ate!
A bit of advice - if you have never cooked grits before, use a large pot. They like to boil over and that is a huge mess.  Also, soak your pot and whisk as soon as you are done otherwise they turn into a substance that makes concrete look soft. :)
Seriously, this is a wonderful guest-worthy meal.

I cooked the grits in chicken broth and evaporated milk. Made for a more creamy and flavorful bowl

Made without the milk, wine and chicken broth.  Delicious.  Sorry, was all gone before we thought to take a picture.

This was great; however, I did add a can of  rotel in at the end. It gave it just the right amount of tomato and zip I was looking for.

This was amazing. I used less half half the can of tomatoes as I'm not really a fan of tomatoes, but it still tasted great. I also used whole milk for creamier grits. Two thumbs up for this.

This was a very satisfying dish. We like it spicy so I doubled the Cajon spices and I used a whole jalape√±o.  I also substituted chicken broth for the water. Delish!

This was a pain! Could not stop the milk/water mixture from boiling over. Gave up and made something else!

Good recipe, tends to be thick. Used half and half instead of 2% milk for the grits.
