I make these muffins at least once a week (alternating between fresh blueberries and fresh raspberries).  Before baking, I sprinkle them with sugar (raw or demamara works nicely).  The only thing I found was that you should mix the wet ingredients separately, then add to the dry.

Delicious. Used chopped fresh peaches instead of blueberries and added an extra 1/4 cup peaches for moisture. My husband who doesn't like muffins said "good" and ate several.

These are really good!! Fluffy and delicious! They puffed up nice and high. I added chocolate chips to mine. They were a HIT! The only thing I would change is the temp of the oven. 400 is WAY too high to bake these for 25 minutes. I only baked mine for 18 minutes and they were done...unfortunately the bottoms browned quite a bit and they were stuck to the paper. I made another batch, changed the temp to 350 and baked for about 25 minutes, give or take. They were PERFECT!! :)

Very Good!!  Quick and easy blueberry muffins that everyone liked.  I added some vanilla and topped with coarse sugar the second time I made them and really liked the enhancements.

Quick, easy, and delicious! Plus it's a great way to use up ripe fruit. The batter was a little dry, so I used a bit more milk and added a couple Tbsp. of veg. oil.  This recipe is a great base for whatever add-in's you have on hand. For the fruit I used peaches and added some vanilla and cinnamon. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin and topped them off with a little turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven for a little extra sweetness and crunch. These baked up beautifully in about twenty minutes. Perfect with a cup of tea!

I had to make a large amount for a breakfast group. I made all the varations. I think I liked choc chip and peach the best. I put extra sugar on top. They were more dry than I would like but they were good.

I used this recipe to make blueberry muffins and strawberry muffins, in both mini-muffin tins and regular tins.  They were pretty good, but I was disappointed that my "bisquick" blueberry muffins were just as good.  I also had problems with these muffins becoming a bit too brown on the outside when I didn't use muffin papers, and sticking to the papers when I did use them.

This is a very good overall muffin recipe.  I add fresh apricots.  I also had to add a little more sugar to the recipe.  They turned out very tasty.  I had to make a second batch to share at work.

These were quite tasty. I tried to make them exactly as written. But my blueberries were from a fresh batch I froze maybe two months earlier, so I thawed, rinsed and stemmed 1 cup of them for this recipe. Also, I was finishing off a can of baking powder, so I used a little more than 2 1/2 teaspoons - probably more like three. The muffins came out nicely fluffy. I found that the minimum baking time of 20 minutes was plenty - they were nicely golden-brown by then. I don't think I'd ever done the "lightly touched" test - I've always used a toothpick - but it worked! I guess I can recommend this recipe for quick and easy breakfast muffins.

The recipe was SUPER easy! And quick! My only complaint was that they were not sweet enough. That was the comment from both my husband and my son, too. We used 1/2 cup peaches and 1/2 cup strawberries, and that was great, but the muffins themselves weren't that sweet. Also, I added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (because I had run out of cinnamon!) and that was a good idea. Next time, I'll add cinnamon instead, but I'm fearful of how much sugar to add, and what I would need to balance it with, so the recipe turns out with the same fluffiness! Overall, great recipe!

I made these last night as written for BF who really like them but for me they need a little more moisture in them other than that they were great and I will be making them again but with fresh fruit instead of the chocolate chips BF really like the chocolate chip part. Will come back with more details after second makings. Thanks for sharing.

Easy recipe with common ingredients already in the pantry. I followed the recipe using blueberries and highly recommend this recipe if you don't like overly sweet muffins. The muffins turned out great with a English Muffin taste. The muffin tops were perfectly crispy and soft inside. The blueberries added just the right amount of sweetness and you can actually taste the berry.

Pretty good, I did fresh blueberry and peach, added vanilla and subbed a combo of oil and applesauce for the butter.  I added a little more sugar because it didnt seem like a lot, and I added the juice of half a lemon to the milk. It tasted a tiny bit biscuit-y and I'm not sure why.

I used whole wheat white flour, "soured" nonfat milk (little lemon juice added to nonfat milk is a great substitute for buttermilk) and a mixture of blueberries, blackberries and strawberries I froze from last summer. I also added a teaspoon vanilla extract and I sprinkled a bit of white sugar over each muffin before baking. These were quick, easy and used pantry ingredients I had on hand.....plus, they were quite tasty.

Very good muffin recipe. I used strawberries and blueberries, sprinkled them with sugar before adding to batter and doubled the amount of fruit. Followed another viewers suggestion and lowered the oven temperature to 350 and baked for 30 minutes. Popped out of the pan like a dream no sticking whatsoever (used cooking oil spray).

These are the closest muffins I can find that are like the ones I made in my eighth grade economics class. The difference is mine says 1/4c veg. oil, 3/4c blueberries, 3tsp BP and 2c flour. THANK YOU!!! Now I can just refer to this recipe when I want to make muffins :]

I kinda hijacked this recipe and beefed it up a bit. I used  3/4 cup of whole wheat flourand 1 cup AP flour (next time I'm going to try to flip those amounts and see what happens). I used brown sugar instead of white. I added 1 grated carrot, 1/2 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Instead of butter I used safflower oil and added 1 mashed ripe banana. OMG as soon as they were cooled off they literally disappered. My children kept coming back for more and insisted that I bake another batch!  Great recipe and very flexible and forgiving!! Would have taken a picture but they were gone so fast!

I found these to be dry and not sweet enough.  I'm making another batch now that I've doubled and added the following 1/2 cup of apple sauce; 1/4 cup of oil; 1/2 cup of yogurt; Hoping to get a moist and sweet muffin.  I also upped the sugar to 1 cup (keep in mind I doubled the original recipe).

I'll add that I do think that this is an excellent starting point because you can add whatever you want to the recipe!

I decided to try this with a cinnamon topping I normally reserve for breakfast cake, and they came out really well!  The muffin itself tastes a little on the biscuit-y side, but with fruit topping it's still quite excellent.

Very good simple muffins. I used fresh strawberries and peaches as the friut. The strawberries turned out better, but both were good. I also added a 1/2 Tablespoon of vanilla to them.

My 15 year old son made these.  They were very easy and very tasty.  I made mini muffins and it took half of the time.  My family enjoyed them very much.  Great taste with chocolate chips.

I had to modify to be gluten free and diary free.  I used the Bob's all purpose gluten free baking mix.  Added 3/4 tsp zanthan gum and substituted coconut oil for the butter.  They came out FANTASTIC!  And I only had dried blueberries.  This will become a "go to" in out house.

they taste like biscuits and they need way more sugar to be edible. They also had a weird texture and didn't brown well.

These muffins were awesome!  Super easy and fast to make and they were devoured instantly...  Good thing I made a double batch to start. They popped right out of my muffin pans (used non-stick spray beforehand) and looked gorgeous. I made half with fresh strawberries and half with chocolate chips. I think this base muffin recipe would be fabulous with most any add-ins because it's not too sweet - I'll definitely be making these again.

I added a scant 1/3 cup of skim milk and a teaspoon of almont extract to the batter. It was way too dry without the milk. I then topped the unbaked muffins with chopped almonds and a bit of granulated sugar for crunch. DELICIOUS.

The muffins were good. Breakfast muffins, not pastry muffins. They taste like a sconce so they're perfect to have them with breakfast and not as a dessert. I dipped mine on honey and they were way better like that. NOTE: Do not over beat otherwise they'll become dry. That is the secret for moist muffins or cakes.

The original recipe is pretty bland (although I used 1 cup of mixed frozen berries since that's all I had on hand) but they were tremendously moist. It's a great base recipe that I'll use from now on but I'll top with sugar to accommodate the taste & will definitely tweak it with different additions from some of the other reviews.

These were just ok.  I agree with earlier reviews that they were biscuit-like.  I used fresh blueberries which made the insides too moist - almost gooey.  Next time I will thaw frozen blueberries and rinse them.  I will probably enjoy these as an afternoon snack but for breakfast I want something sweeter and more cake-like.

I am always looking for the perfect muffin recipe for my 3 little kids (and me) and this one is awesome!! today we made some with apple, some with choc. chip and some with choc. chip and banana.  The consistency comes out right!  and not too much sugar - that is so great.  Wondering if I will ruin it if I mix some whole wheat in, instead of all white flour.

These are good, basic and versatile muffins. I made as directed except I used unbleached flour. They weren't overly sweet--just right.  I won't say they're out-of-this-world, but they are pretty good.

This was a very simple fantastic recipe for muffins.  The muffins are moist and easy to add any variation of fruit or chocolate chips.  My kids love them.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and some cinnamon and I followed another readers advice and sprinkled sugar on the top.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!! Goes with sausages, bacon, eggs, anything! and it's not just limited to blueberries, practically anything can go in. One day I tried with bananas, the next day I tried with pineapples and they both taste GREAT!! So just try putting something in there, get wild, get creative. If you tried putting something else in there, then tell us how it tasted, post a comment or something

This is a really good recipe.  I ended up substituting the flour whith whole wheat flour, and I add a bit of allspice and cinnamon to taste.  Instead of using fresh fruit I opted for frozen, that way my batter didn't change color.  They turned out very good and are easy to make in a rush.

We just made this muffins and they are really great. Like everyone says, they are not too sweet, which is what I was looking for.  We smashed a ripe banana and added crushed walnuts (which i crushed with a hand masher). I didn't measure the walnuts, but i'd say it was probably 1/2 cup. Had the taste of banana nut bread -yummy.  Next time I will try blueberries.  Bye the way, I took a picture that i'm going to upload for you to see:-)

I think these are great!  I had to cut the salt because I'm on a low sodium diet, and they were still good!  I did add vanilla.  I made then with peaches and strawberries.  Next week, blackberries!

Nice, light muffins.  I flavored them with choc chips, orange zest and a little orange juice. Not too sweet.  Will use this basic recipe again.

I used vanilla essence and strawberries chopped. Topped it with unrefined sugar before baking. Tasted pretty good. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great way to use up fruit that may be less than eye-appealing to eat.  I had some strawberries and love to try different muffin recipes.  Read the reviews first and saw the same issues with dryness, lack of sweetness, and need for 'something'.  I actually doubled the recipe, as I had exactly 2 cups of berries.  Subbed yogurt milk drink (which is alot like buttermilk)1 cup and 1/2 cup vanilla coffee creamer; I thought that would take care of the sweetness and vanilla issue.  Also added the zest of one tangerine.  Added about 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  This had a wonderful strawberry-orange flavor.  They rose like a picture and were not at all dry and were plenty sweet without being too sweet.  I think the coffee creamer did nicely.  Would definitely make again.  These make a beautiful presentation for a muffin.

I used canned peaches in this recipie and it tasted pretty good, a little bland though. 

The only problem I had was that I used muffin papers and the baked muffins really stuck to them. When you pull the paper off you lose about 1/3 of the muffin.

I think these muffins were pretty good.  They aren't as sweet as some, but are excellent with butter, more like a roll than a muffin.  I also highly reccomend sprinkling the tops with brown sugar.  It is an easy addition that makes a big difference.

Good recipe, I made them with raspberries.
But, as others, I recommend adding vanilla extract.
Also, next time I'll add more than one cup of fruit.

Made with freshly picked strawberries.  Excellent results, followed the recipe to the letter.
One observation, these tend to not store well, past a few days, at least for me. They can be frozen and defrosted successfully, however.

I gave it 5 stars with the following changes:  I added 1 banana, vanilla &  cinnamon. I switched out 1 cup of white flour for whole wheat flour, used canola oil instead of melted butter. The crumb was light and fully, not dry at all. I think this would be good with any fruit or chocolate chips as the poster suggested. Thanks for a great base recipe!

11.10.18  I added strawberries and some white chocolate chips.  I used buttermilk since I had it on hand, and considering the batter was very, very thick, I did add more of it.  The texture isn’t quite muffin, but it also isn’t like a biscuit, as many others have stated.  I can see adding either some vanilla or almond extract which I think will ramp up the flavor. considerably.  These were so very simple to make and pretty darn tasty that they deserve another try to get them up to 5 stars.  Not totally unhappy today with how they turned out.

This is my first attempt at a recipe from this site. They turned out ok but i think I might add a bit more sugar next time. The blueberries added good flavour but if you had a bite without any fruit, it was very bland.

The major difference with how I made these, is that I made mine gluten-free. I just used gluten free all purpose flour and gluten free baking powder. I also used different fruit. Instead of blueberries, I used strawberries, mangoes, and peaches. They were quite tasty. I found that the texture is more like a biscuit rather than a muffin, but it was still good. I will definitely make these again

I  made these muffins couple times so far and everyone absolutely loves them. I will continue making them in the future. The only thing different I've done so far is to add a handful of white chocolate chips in with the blueberries. And voila , heaven . Two thumbs up

It was taste but only 1/3 cup of sugar didn't cut it for the amount of flour and others ingredients. Since the fresh blueberries are sour the muffins were kind of sour with the little sugar that is required . Next time I do, I would recommend more sugar.

Best blueberry muffins ever; I would have given 5 stars, but I doubled the blueberries and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also used bread flour instead of regular all-purpose, and sifted all the dry ingredients before adding the wet, then folded in the blueberries. But, basic recipe is spot-on. Even my husband, who will not usually touch a muffin, has already eaten 2 since making yesterday, so I'm going to try strawberry muffins next!

Good taste but I prefer my muffins soft. These were  dry and a bit biscuity, so I added some vegetable oil ( ran out of butter) and milk, and they were perfect afterwards.

Easy to make. Not a sweet cakey muffin but rather a blueberry biscuit like consistency and flavor. I added sugar and vanilla extract to liven it up. Good warm with  a little butter.  Definitely not a dessert because of the mildness but would be great with breakfast.

I made these in a muffin tin that makes 24 mini muffins and the cook time for that is about 10-12 minutes. I also figured out that you shouldn't put the milk and melted butter together before you combine them with the rest of the ingredients; I made that mistake and the butter sore-solidified and I had to start over with the wet ingredients. I would suggest combining the milk and egg separately from the butter but adding them all to the dry ingredients together.

Easy and delicious.  I had peaches that needed some attention so I diced them into tiny bits & added 1 cup to my batter.  Also added 1 extra Tbsp sugar + 1 tsp vanilla per previous reviewers suggestions (seriously, you guys are the best).  Sweet & moist with an almost floral fragrance from the peaches.  My batch didn't brown, but they're not contestants in the muffin beauty pageant so I don't mind.

I made this for my brother and sisters and they were  alright. I overcooked them and they were very crunchy. I added peanut butter instead of fruit and it could have used more. I recommend only 20 minutes at the most.

I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and substituted orange juice for the milk. Gave it a nice, mild orange flavor. Used fresh raspberries and blackberries. This is not a super sweet recipe but it's light and tasty. Very easy, I was able to make it even with a fiesty 5-month-old demanding my full attention.

Love this recipe! I used strawberries with a little sugar- delicious! I added a little vanilla (just a bit!) and it gave it a very rich flavor! I absolutely loved it! I can't stop eating them, so good job! Will make again, and again, and again!

I make these muffins a few times a month, and they've never disappointed. I've used pears (highly recommended), black raspberries, blueberries (fresh and dried), blackberries, red raspberries, strawberries with and without rhubarb... The list goes on. Always good.  Excellent base for whatever you want to add.

Made as is but added to tops before putting them in the oven. This makes my girls think it's a sweet treat.

Love this recipe.  I use about half unbleached flour and half whole wheat
pastry flour.  Usually make it with blueberries.  Tried peaches once but didn't like them.

The texture was good, but the flavor was nothing to get excited about. I used blueberries for the fruit and 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. They were OK, maybe a nice basic muffin recipe for someone new to cooking, but I was a little disappointed with it. Thanks anyway.

These were excellent! I made them for family breakfast one day, and they were a huge hit! It was very easy to make, and easily changed, and that just makes it better! Good work!

Was disappointed.  Too crumbly, not much flavor, not sweet enough.  Would not make again. I used nectarines in mine & even added sugar to the fruit & added vanilla, but still wasn't very good.

I made these with raspberries and they were pretty good.  I added some baking spice (nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.) which added flavor, but my kids wanted them to be sweeter.

We thought these muffins were good but nothing special.  I made them with strawberries & even added extra strawberries & a bit of vanilla, but they were still a bit on the bland side.
