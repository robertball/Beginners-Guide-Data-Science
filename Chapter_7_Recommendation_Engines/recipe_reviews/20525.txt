I loved this! I too thought it should be "dressed up" a bit. I pressed crumbled cooked bacon bits around the sides instead of the cracker. yum! Thanks for sharing

This was very well received at a wine tasting party we attended.  I added parsley to the top to brighten it up a bit and in the future I would only use the Cheese Nips as a crust on the bottom, not the sides.  I would press parsley into the sides instead, since it's not the most attractive dish.

A wonderful savory version of a traditional cheese cake.  Tastes best if made one day ahead.  Rave reviews from my guests.

can't say it was not good, 'cause it was quite well liked. Only, I expected something different: I prepared it for a brunch and it came out as a pie with a crumbly crust. And was received as a pie by everybody, nobody at all questioned the matter. As I had leftovers and some other people to dinner 2 days later, I decided to warm it and serve it cut into little morsels, with onion and cider chutney. Well, it's been a hit!
