I made a few changes to this wonderful recipe.  First- I doubled the recipe and put only one layer of ice cream sandwiches in the bottom of a 9 x 13 dish.  Next, I made the filling except doubled everything and added a little bit of milk to make the filling more creamy.  I also added about a whole box of crushed oreos into the filling. I placed the filling on top of the sandwiches.  Lastly, I topped the filling with a container of whipped topping and garnished with more crushed oreos.

Fantastic! I got 24 icecream sandwiches and did a double layer in a 9x13 pan. I also poured some extra hot fudge sauce over the top layer of sandwiches before frosting with the whipped topping. My 20 yr old daughter said it was the best dessert ever!

This was easy and everyone loves it. This is the second time for me making this recipe. I double everything and make it in a disposable 9 by 13 pan. The elasticity of the disposable pan really helps the sandwiches to fit the way you want them to. I used extra Oreos by adding a layer of them to the bottom of the 'cake' and a sprinkle of them on top of the cool whip 'frosting'. I also added a little milk to the pudding mixture to thin it out a bit while mixing... it gets way to thick otherwise and is difficult to mix and spread. The idea of adding a layer of raspberry or something of the like is fantastic (see review below) and I think I will try that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

After my husband's first bite he said "save this recipe".  My family fought over the leftovers the next day.  I made this for a birthday dinner dessert and I had concerns about it being enough for 8 people because it is about the size of a loaf pan.  It is very rich so you do not eat a huge slice, we actually had some left over. It was very quick to assemble which is a huge bonus.

Great and easy dessert.  Change the flavors by changing to different flavor sandwiches.  Next time I make it though I will have a large tub (or 2  8ozs tubs) because there just wasn't enough to completely "frost" it the way I like.  I may also try the neapolitan sandwiches and maybe sliced strawberry layer.  Yum!!

I have made this twice. Once with mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies. Another time I made it with vanilla ice cream sandwiches and mint oreos. Both delicious! Not a lot of work for an amazing ice cream cake (:

I got this recipe in the KRAFT magazine and had all the ingredients, so I decided to try it.  This was so good it tasted just like a real ice cream cake. I did not change one thing about this and it turned out great. Won't be wasting money on real ice cream cakes now.

This was really good - not a DQ cake by any means, but still very tasty.  I used a 9X13 pan.  18 ice cream sandwiches, double layered (Some broken into halves - to fit the pan).  Almost a full pound package of Oreo's for the fudge cookie crunch.  (Best part!!!)   I will probably make this again - it just wasn't the right thing for the husband's thirtieth birthday.

Super easy and quick to make. Great eye appeal. I used mint Oreo cookies.
I sprinkled a few Oreo chunks on top and drizzled with fudge sauce before serving. Very tasty.

This was really good and was gorgeous! I added some milk to the pudding mixture because I thought that it seemed too thick. But, I do not recommend this! I overdid it, and it ended up too thin, so I had to stick it in the freezer before putting it together. Follow the recipe and you won't be sorry!

QUICK, EASY, and EVERYONE LOVED it!  I purchased the 24 pack from Sam's Club because I was making this for a larger party.  I used a 9x13 and could have filled the entire pan with 26 of them- 2 layers, but used 22 and trimmed the end to make it even.  I also doubled the filling-which I recommend making before you start.  I added a REALLY thin coat of Reece's Chocolate Hardening Shell for a Zing of added taste before 2nd layer.  Work QUICKLY because it melts FAST!  I blended softened vanilla ice cream (as a previous recommendation), stuck it back in the freezer for 30 minutes and then iced the cake- easy peasy!  I lined my pan with several layers of parchment paper for easy removal. After icing, I recommend squeezing it back into the pan-did this without much trouble- so it would freeze with clean lines. Took it out of the freezer 10 minutes before serving and it was GONE before I knew it- with everyone wanting seconds!  1 week later and people are still reminiscing about how good it was and Reece's was a nice added flavor that some people noticed- and other's didn't! YUM YUM + 2 thumbs up for being quick and easy!

Three layers seemed extreme for 4 people so I just did two and we only ate half the thing and we had big pieces!  It was realllllly good!  I will definitely make this again.

This is an amazingly easy recipe! My son wanted an oreo ice cream cake for his bday party & after seeing what was available @ the grocery I decided to try for myself & am SO happy I did! I doubled the recipe & iced it w/ bakery icing from this site. I did add a little extra milk to the pudding layer to make it creamier & added more crushed oreos but overall it's the same recipe. SO EASY!! We will be making this one often!

I made this for my husbands birthday. The family loved it. They liked it so much, they want me to make it for Thanksgiving, instead of Mud Pie. I doubled the recipe. However, I didn't have two packages of chocolate pudding, so I used one chocolcate, and one vanilla....perfect!!!

Easy and delicious. I wondered how you could layer it as described with out the cool whip/chocolate mixture being a mess or having everything slide all around, but the pudding really solidifies the cool whip and it becomes very 'cement-like' which is good. Tasted delicious, the Oreos added an excellent crunch.

Heavenly deliciousness! Pretty simple to make, looks lovely, and tastes amazing. All my friends thought I made it from scratch when there's only 5 ingredients! Will make this again - so much cheaper than buying a DQ ice cream cake.

Fudge filling was delicious! Be sure to have the ice cream cakes are completely frozen before you work with them, or they will ooze! Otherwise, very easy and quick and yummy! The fudgy filling tastes just like brownie batter withouth the egg!

Tastes like eating 3 ice cream sandwiches at once.  Not really like eating an ice cream cake.  Too much cake, not enough ice cream.  The pudding/filling part was yummy and tasted like the kind you'd find in a store-bought ice cream cake.

Delicious. The pudding and chocolate topping in the filling make it so decadent and fudgy. I will happily make this again, though I will keep another 8oz of cool whip on hand to frost with: for my tastes I wanted the full 8oz written in the filling. I also did not use foil and just assembled/frosted in a shallow pan, figuring the freezer would keep it standing: my ice cream bars couldn't quite handle that and the bottom ice cream layers smooshed out. I will wrap in foil or double in a 13X9 and just frost the top, in the future. Thanks so much for sharing.

This gets a 5 star from the test group, but as the cook, i'd give it a 4.  I didn't particularly like the texture of the chocolate filler layer, it was crunchy, and next time am thinking of actually making the pudding to see what that does.  Overall it was pretty good, and very rich.  I doubled the recipe and had more than plenty left over for 8 people.  Would make again, with some variations.

After reading the reviews I almost thined it out with a little milk.  So glad I didnt.  It was not hard to spread and tasted great.  I did put all of it together except the cool whip.  I wraped it tight in foil and put in the frezzer for a couple of hours then took it out, covered it in cool whip, drizzeled with hot fudge and crushed oreos and put it back in the frezzer.  Looked great, tasted even better!

Excellent dessert!  I tried to make mine just a bit healthier, used Cool Whip Free and Sugar Free chocolate pudding.  I also used mint oreos, since thats what we had on hand, and the only ice cream sandwhiches I found had chocolate chips in them.  This was an awesome dessert, looks great too, had made for when company was over.  Veyr rich though, but its a keeper!

The dessert assembled quickly.  I layed freezer paper in a loaf pan and then assembled the dessert, then turned it over and pulled off the paper and put the topping on it when I was ready to serve it.  I added chopped pecans, extra creamy Cool Whip, a few more Oreos and Smuckers hot fudge topping.  While I don't think it was comparable to famous chain ice cream cakes, it was good.  A big hit with the hubby and our boys.  :)

I made this cake using 12 ice cream sandwiches on the bottom layer, filling in the middle, and 12 ice cream sandwiches on top.  Followed the recipe exactly (except for the layering).  It was AWESOME and I got rave reviews.  I think 2 layers is plenty.

Outstanding! Beautiful, easy and rich. We don't need to purchase expensive ice cream cakes anymore. Can easily adapt by changing the type of cookies, pudding and/or ice cream sandwich flavors. I think the third layer is necessary to get the full "wow" impression.

Not quite as good as DQ but this cake was fantastic.  I added more Oreo cookies and used 2 containers of Cool Whip.  I decorated the top with whip cream and more oreo cookies.  Everyone wanted a piece. Thanks for the recipe!!

Who knew that these things mixed together could make something sooo decadently good. Very rich. Had a small sliver and even that was to much. I prepared this as directed. Very quick and easy. I actually think I spent more time waiting for the cool whip to defrost so that could finally make this.

This was very easy and great!  I used a 6oz tub of  chocolate cool whip dip and 2oz of regular cool whip.  I do recommend leaving the ice cream sandwiches in the freezer until you are ready to put this together.  I will be making this again!  I did not make a freezer packet, I just put my cookie sheet in the freezer until it was chilled.

This is super easy to make and a great tasting dessert. It also looks nice when served. I add sprinkles on top of the cool whip based on the occasion. For the 4th of July, I added red, white and blue sprinkles.

This is a great recipe! You could change the flavors and make it all your own! It is very easy to put together. I would recommend buying two tubs of whipped topping though. There was not enough to "ice" the entire cake with. Added some toffee chips on top. Will never buy another ice cream cake from the store!

We enjoyed this. The presentation is quite pretty and my husband was impressed that it was "just" ice cream sandwiches. I am making it for a 4th of July picnic, but I will make it with a more substantial frosting (i.e. Cool Whipped Frosting from this site) because the plain Cool Whip melted very quickly once out of the freezer. I also may add a layer of raspberry or caramel for added flavor. Thanks!

I made this for a dinner party for family and friends last night.  It was wonderful with a "This is the best cake I think I have ever tasted" comment.  Thank you so much for sharing.  The only thing I did different was used Carmel sauce instead of Hot Fudge and used Devel Food Instant pudding instead of chocolate.

I had to "surrender" an ice cream sandwich from the box to my daughter, so I was then left with 11.  Easy enough...I just spread the entire fudge/whip topping layer between two layers of five sandwiches. I put the extra sandwich in the freezer for my daughter to have another time.  It was a very good dessert, an upgrade from plain ice cream.

Delicious!  I made this with my toddler for my husband's Father's Day treat...it is simple to make, yet so much richer than it sounds.  The pudding mixed in with the cool whip, fudge & cookies is what makes this a treat!  We added a few extra cookies into the mix & crumbled some on top as well...A+!!

Really nice for Fathers Day!  I made this exactly as recipe stated.  Please don't thin down chocolate mousse filling like others say.  It will be thick when you are assembling, but it's really good this way.  Once frozen, it almost seems like fudge chocolate layer with oreos.

Perfect for a hot summer day! I have made this twice and each time this cake is gone within minutes after being served.  It's so easy to make.  I have used both a an ice cream topping and Hershey's syrup and each one I didn't have any problems.  For a new twist on dessert I would highly recommend trying this one!

I got this recipe from Kraft magazine about a year ago.  I made it as a birthday cake for a friend who love Oreos.  I used cookies and cream sandwiches and after the whip had set a bit, I covered the cake with more Oreos.  It was delicious!

This was a fun cake to make and eat!  I made it just as the recipe called for, and it turned out wonderful.  While shopping for the ingredients, I came across "Banana Split" ice cream sandwiches, that had vanilla, strawberry, and banana ice cream all in one sandwich.  I mad it with those, and it looked fantastic when cutting the cake.  This recipe goes in my "special" collection.

This was a smashing success. All the measurements were right on. I broke up my cookies rather than chopped and regretted it as I was trying to spread the pudding mixture, it took a bit more work to smooth it out properly.

I followed other reviewers' advice: I added more cool whip to make a "lighter" taste.  I was afraid it would be too rich.  Then I only made it 2 layers instead of the three.  It was made with five full sized bars side by side and then one bar cut in half longways.  It made a larger layer.  The next layer was just like this.  After creating the layers, I put it in the freezer for a little while longer to set.  Then I frosted the whole thing with the remaining chocolate layer mix with some extra cool whip added.  This cake has so many layers of complimentary tastes!!!  I will make this again.  Next time I will get more IC sandwiches and make a bigger "cake"...still using only two layers.  This is a great treat for those informal family get-togethers!

Very, very good. A good suggestion if your fudge filling is too thick - add a bit of milk to the mixture before mixing in the chopped oreos - just to get it to spreading consistency. Made this for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loved it.

I made this for my son's school (a private school of about 20 kids).  They LOVED it!  Some said it was better than a DQ cake.  I did customize it though.  The local country store didn't have any ice cream sandwiches so I made the first layer w/ vanilla bean ice cream.  I doubled the recipe too by layering a 1/2 gallon of ice cream in a 9X13 pan, doubled the middle layer, and added a whole tub of whipped cream.  Since the pudding mixture seemed a bit thick, I added about 1/4 C. of milk to the mixture. Also, I used 2 rows of the Oreo's.   I will definatly make again-next time w/ the ice cream sandwiches though!  :)

I made this ice cream cake for my husband's birthday party and everyone loved it!  Like some of the other reviews I made some changes:  I doubled the recipe (besides the ice cream sandwiches), mixed up about a whole box of Oreos into the pudding filling, and crumbled the leftover Oreos on top of the cool whip.  Basically the layers were in this order: ice cream sandwiches (bottom); pudding layer with Oreos (middle); cool whip (top); and then leftover crumbled Oreos on top of that.

What is NOT to like about this recipe? It's quick, easy, versatile and delicious! I love cake, but am not a fan of ice cream cakes. Which is why I buy them for birthday occasions--to keep me from eating way too much of it. However, I had TWO pieces of this!

This is good but waaaaaaay too rich.  I normally like very rich desserts but the fudge layer in this dessert is just too much.  I would use about half of the recommended amount of filling or else it's just way too sweet.

I made this cake for my family yesterday.  I have been craving an ice cream cake, and it's been over 100 degrees here in our town for over a week so this was the perfect dessert!  It was delicious!!  I forgot to add the Oreo into the filling, so I crushed the cookies in a zip lock bag and mixed them into the Cool Whip that I iced the cake with.  Then when I served the cake, I drizzled more chocolate fudge over each person's slice.  My kids absolutly loved it! And so did my husband, he's a true chocolate addict!  My husband and I indulged on another slice of cake late last night, and I found that the longer the it sat in the freezer the better it got! This is definitly a recipe that will be going into my box of favorites!

I made this exactly as written and it was ok.  It was simple and looked nice but personally I thought it tasted just like ice cream sandwiches.  I suppose I was hoping for some magical transformation with the addition of the other ingredients.  It was very easy to make (my 2 & 3 year old helped) and the prep time was quick but I just wasn't impressed.  Homemade ice cream cake takes a little bit of time but the end result is so much better and I can make a lot more quantity wise for the money.

So easy and so good!  This was gobbled up and it was so quick to put together!  The only change I made was to add more like 3/4 pound of Oreos.  Next time I will use my stand mixer/electric beaters to combine the pudding mix since it gets to thick.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The best thing I can say about this recipe is that it's easy to put together and you can make it well ahead.  The taste was just OK.  Perhaps a "premium" ice cream sandwich would make a difference.

This was really good but next time I don't think I'll use ice cream sandwiches, if I do it will be just one layer and the other layers will be ice cream because it was just a little too much chocolate to finish a whole piece but other than that it was really good it..the oreo fudge layer tastes just like the fudge layer in dairy queen ice cream cakes.

This recipe was excellent!  I made it for a family gathering and all the kids asked if I could make it for their next birthday.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13. It's a definite do-again!

This was very good. I followed the advice on doubling the recipe however I dont recommend doing this unless you have a lot of people to serve. I personally found it way to chocolately though and so next time I will try using a different kind of pudding for the filling and I will also double up on the cool whip since there wasn't nearly enough. Overall though it was very good.

I made this for some friends and they were impressed!  Little did they know that it is SUPER easy to make!  I made with FF coolwhip, low fat icecream sandwiches and sugar free/FF pudding mix and low sugar hot fudge sauce.  Turned out WONDERFUL!!

delicious! this cake looks so pretty when you serve it, because of the layers, and everyone thinks its do complicated to make, but its so simple thanks to the ice cream sandwiches! i found it delicious but a bit too rich the first time i made it, so the second time i put a bit more coolwhip into the chocolate layer and liked it better this way. i also use chocolate chip cookies instead of oreos. everyone always loves this and asks for the recipe! i also have made it with only 2 layers, and i think its great like that as well. if im making it for an ocassion where i know there'll be other desserts, then i only make 2 layers because i find its too much with 3.

I've made this a few times. Always well received. As a twist this past time, I used mint oreos. yum! Work fast and it might help to freeze the cake for 10 mins before you ice.

I just now served this to my husband for his 28th birthday and he said, " This is better than Carvel, Baskin Robins, and Dairy Queen!" (Even after a big steak dinner he still had seconds on his cake!) The only changes I made were to use Oreos, Pudding, and Hot Fudge that had mint in them (hubby's fav). I only ended up using 9 ice cream bars though, since it was just us two. This cake was perfect!

This was a big hit for a crowd of hungry teenage girls.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a disposable 9x13 foil pan.  Since this is quite rich, the portion size does not have to be very big so this was enough for 20  with about 1/3 left-over.  Super easy make-ahead dessert for a crowd.

Great recipe!!  I used a 9x13 inch pan and just had two layers of ice cream sandwiches.  I used 23 sandwiches all together.  The chocolate filling is so good when it is frozen.  It taste somewhat similiar to the crunchies found in the carvel ice cream cakes.  One suggestion.  Make this cake a day befor so that it freezes up completely.  Super yummy cake, and very easy too.  I will make this again and again.

I would have liked more ice cream.  The fudge center mixed with the sandwich overpowered the ice cream within the sandwich.

I have made variations on this recipe from recipe my mom gave me about 25-30 years ago when she first got it from a friend. I had always seen it in a 9 x 13 glass pyrex. This is another spin on a great idea. Thanks for the new spin on an old favorite!

I am SO glad that I decided to make this for Memorial Day.  I followed the recipe exactly. I put the bottom layer in a 8x11 glass pan and stacked it up from there (used 3 layers of 4 ice cream sandwiches as directed), and wrapped the whole thing in foil to put in the freezer.  It was  excellent - even better than I thought it would be.  The chocolate/oreo mixture did remind me of thick fudge brownie.  Coolwhip on the outside with a few more crushed oreos - perfect!  The layers looked great when we cut it, and the kids and adults ate everything!

Used 9x13 pan and 2 layers of ice cream sandwiches with the filling in between. Doubled the filling (almost) using only a standard sized jar of hot fudge. Put some of the hot fudge over the first layer of sandwiches and the rest in double cool whip/pudding mixture. "Frosted" with cool whip and covered with crushed oreos.

Easy to make and so good!  Made it for Thanksgiving dessert along with other baked goods.  This was the first thing that all 20 of my guests headed towards.  Everyone raved about it and wanted seconds.   I did add a bit of milk to the pudding mixture to thin it out to make spreadable.  That is the only change I made.  I did add oreo cookies crumbs on top before I wrapped and put back into freezer. YUMMY!

Added more Cool Whip and a few more cookies.  The whole family was surprised by how great it tasted and that I was capable of making something so wonderful!  Thank you!  Definitely a "do again" recipe!

It's not a Carvel or Baskins Robbins cake that's for sure!  I was VERY disappointed with this cake - I made 2 versions, and both got rave reviews from everyone else.  I guess I'm just an ice cream snob.  I made both cakes at the same time, I used 1lb of crushed oreos and 1 larger tub of light cool whip with 2 boxes of sugar free chocolate pudding.  I discovered while making them, it's a bad idea to make 2 at the same time.  The ice cream bars melt FAST!  So ended up sticking the one for Father's Day back in the freezer til this morning to make.  Because it was so sloppy, I thought that was why yesterday's cake came out bad.  This morning I ran out and bought more oreos and simply sandies.  I added more milk to the pudding mix (it had been refrigerated) to thin it out and added more cookies since they disappeared overnight and I wanted there to be some crunch.  The second cake looked tons better but you still have to work fast - also transporting is a little harder because the ice cream bars I got melted so quickly.  Even people on idets had 2nds of the cake today, but I still didn't care for it - it was too soft.  I prefer ice cream cakes that are more solid and with a crunch like Carvel & Baskin Robbins.

I made this for my little cousin's birthday and loved it! Very easy to put together, inventive and a heck of a lot cheaper than the normal store bought ice cream cake!

Made this for a dinner with friends, and it was very popular.  I used half vanilla sandwiches and half neopolitan for variety.

Tried this today for Father's Day and it was very good!  I doubled the Oreo's called for and next time I will use more Cool Whip, but my family gobbled it up (although it's pretty rich)---I will be keeping this in my recipe file for sure!

Really good even when using low fat ingredients.  Only thing I did different was add crushed oreos to the top for looks.

A co-worker made this for someone's birthday here at work, and it was great. She said it was really easy -- only 5 ingredients -- so I'm trying it this weekend.

This recipe is so good! And the cake was easy to assemble too. My eleven year old daughter and her friends made this cake by themselves. The results were wonderful. When I read the ingredients I figured that the cake would be too rich but it had just enough chocolate! I will definetly save this recipe!

This is way better than store bought ice cream cake. I make this all the time for birthdays or just for a week night dessert. I also drizzle the hot fudge sauce all over the top.  Delicious!!

this cake was so easy to make and it was delicious! i followed previous advice and added some milk to the chocolate/pudding mixture. I also used a whole box of mint oreos which added a great flavor. Got rave reviews from everyone who ate it!
