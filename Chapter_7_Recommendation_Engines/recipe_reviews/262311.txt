This recipe was just ok...I didn't have siracha sauce so I used some red pepper to give it some heat. I thought it was lacking something so I added some fresh garlic and ginger and it definitely helped. I also stirred in some bamboo shoots to give it a little crunch.

I felt like the sauce on this dish was lacking something sweet. The only change I made from the as written recipe was cutting down the amount of siracha, so my kids would eat it. I will try this again, but will increase the amount of coconut milk and peanut butter.

It was too spicy and not sweet enough the first time.  So now I am using MORE coconut milk and less sriracha and soy sauce.

This was delicious. I cut down the Sriracha in the sauce for my mother in law’s sensitive palate and my husband and I added more to the sauce on our own plates. We love peanut sauces, so I doubled the sauce for this recipe. The vegetable mixture was the perfect combination. I served this with jasmine rice.

My family loved it!!!! I made it a bit more saucy by adding more of all the sauce ingredients. It’s very simple to make as well!
