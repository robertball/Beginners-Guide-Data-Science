This was really good! I did have to add a little more mayo (the warm pasta soaked it up), and omitted the hardboiled eggs (my husband doesn't like them) and the green onions. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder as well after taste testing. I also added 3 stalks diced celery. This was a great lunch! (I didn't use quite as much edamame as called for, because I had to shell mine and it was a pain, it was a great addition though!)

I make this all of the time, just not with the edamame.  If we want it as a full meal I make it with grilled, diced chicken but more times than not, I use this as a standard macaroni salad and omit the chicken and edamame.  Itâ€™s always a huge hit!  Also, I use cubed Colby cheese (8oz block) instead of cheddar and typically more paprika and mayo.  Such an awesome recipe!! Thank you!!!!!!

My son thought it had a delicious flavor and he is hard to please.
This was our first time trying edamame and it is surprisingly good.
Thanks for a great recipe.

it was a little dry added more dressing but overall it was a good change from normal pasta salads
