I loved it. I made a few changes: exchanged  brown sugar for honey, milk for almond milk, plain cinnamon for Ceylon cinnamon, vanilla extract for sugar free vanilla creamer, and added 2 cups of crushed ice. 3rd time

This is pretty tasty. I didn't use raw egg, and also reduced the cinnamon as a preference. This makes a really large drink--good for breakfast.
