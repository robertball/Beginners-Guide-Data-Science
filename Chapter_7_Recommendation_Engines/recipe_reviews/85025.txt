This is really good! I used fresh cilantro for the sauce. Otherwise made as written (and threw a few grated carrots in with the snap peas). I served this with roasted new potatoes and like the way it all went together. Thanks!

Very tasty. Very pretty. Very quick and easy to make. The 25 minute timeline is accurate and that's a great turn around time for a dish that looks this pretty and tastes this good. The flavors are subtle and I did add a little salt to the finished product. I also used fresh cilantro in the sauce like the previous reviewer. The chicken cutting (vs. pounding) tip was very helpful, a much less messy way to thin the chicken breasts.

This was very tasty and gourmet looking.  I had whole coriander seeds so I had to crush them with my motar and pestle so it probably wasn't as smooth as the purchased kind.  I also had fresh cilantro on hand instead of jarred.  Loved the end product and will probably make again in the future.
