DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.  Really flavorful and easy.  I made it exactly as directed and it was spicy but not too hot.  My kids loved it, and there were no leftovers.

We had to add some milk to the dressing to get it think enough to pour.  next time I will use two cans of beans because we were wanting more.

This was amazing, especially with the avacado-yoghurt sauce. I made the dirty rice from scratch and mixed the veggies and beans into it, but that was the only change.

I made this tonight for dinner and not only was it delicious and flavorful but it actually looked just like the picture.  I did a slight modification to the dressing and added more yogurt and oil to give it a creamier consistency because it was a little too thick.  I think some chopped tomatoes would have been good in it too.
