This recipe was absolutely delicious. I've tried many different variations of hummus but this one is my favorite. The only thing I changed was to use the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes jar instead of regular olive oil. It really gives it the kick of sun-dried tomato flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Awesome! I halfed the recipe (used 1 clove of garlic) and omitted the tahini - AMAZING! This is the best hummus I've ever had.

This hummus is the best that I have ever had! One time I made this recipe and substituted the sun dryed tomatoe for 1 whole jalipeno. Again, the hummus was fantastic!

Excellent start of a recipe! I was intrigued by the idea of adding sundried tomatoes...the only change I made was to roast the garlic first as I find raw garlic to be very bitter in hummus.  Roasting gives it a nice, sweet taste.  I also used tomatoes I dried myself and elminated the use of the oil altogether as I find it isn't necessary and adds calories.  I drizzle up to a 1/4 of water into the hummus while pureeing to obtain the desired consistency.  With these tweaks - I have a heart healthy snack!

THE MOST AMAZING RECIPE!! As a Culinary Student at Le Cordon Bleu in Orlando, my Cusines Across Cultures teacher always ask us to bring in different recipes. I like bringing in my own but since i never made hummus I brought this one.. My chef as well as a few other top chefs in our school went crazy for this!! I used more sdt's and even used some of the oil. I left the sdt's  kinda chunky and made some fresh pita bread. Perfect score!! I'm deff. going to do it AGAIN.. for my catering business ;)

Oh, wow. This is SO good! I just realized I forgot to add the basil, but it's still excellent. I took another reviewer's suggestion and used some of the oil from the tomatoes. The texture is just wonderful, and the flavor is perfect. This will be a regular in our house. Next time, I'll remember the basil!

This was good - my first attempt at hummus turned out very well and I got a lot of great comments about it!  I will try other recipes next time - but this one had lots of tomato flavor and a nice texture!  I did add in some of the juice from the beans to thin it out a bit.

I didn't have that much olive oil so I used less. Added red pepper for a little kick. It's good with pita chips. Great snack!

This is a great recipe for hummus. I have made it a few times, but I add canned tomato also to give it some more tomato flavor and to help with the consistency.  I also think this has a bit too much garlic. Everyone I serve this to loves it!

Just made this, only difference is I used black beans instead garbanzo beans, and peanut butter instead of tahini. (I didn't have tahini paste and read you could use peanut butter instead.) This is delicious!

I didnt have any basil or tahini so I added some green onions instead and the taste was delicious! I added paprika, sundried tomatos , fresh squeezed lemon juice, 2 tbsp grapeseed oil & 2 tbsp olive oil. Salt , pepper and 3 cloves of garlic. Love it and will make again.

Yum! I halved the oil and ground sesami seeds when blending everything else instead of buying expensive tahini. It was so delicious and a fraction of the cost of store bought hummus.

I had a problem getting it to be really smooth (Might just be a problem with my food processor?)  But the flavor is really good and it's a healthy and cheap snack to have on hand.

This is definitely the best hummus I've made so far. Instead of sun dried tomatoes though I used diced chili style tomatoes and added about a 1/3 cup of onion and used kept half of the garbanzo bean juice from one of the cans. It was superb!

this hummus is delicious!  I added extra sun dried tomatoes, oil from the sun dried tomato bottle and extra garbanzo bean juice and water.  it was so delicious, my friend tried it, insisted I printed the recipe and went directly home to make it.

This was a good recipe. I didn't have any tahini or sesame seeds so I substituted what I had 2Tbs pumpkin seeds. Also used the oil from the sundried tomato jars that had lots of herbs in it. Processed until it was super creamy! Delicious with fresh hot naan bread

Very good recipe. I made a bed of cabbage and spread some of this on it, rolled it up and it was a great, quick snackl. I'm trying to stay off all of the crackers, breads, and pasta, so this worked out well for me so I could still enjoy it. If you do eat crackers, my favorite ones to put this hummus on are those Almond Nut Thins.

I made this hummus once and I've since made it at least once a week! It's funny, it doesn't completely "come together" until finally you add the basil, but in the end it's amazing.

We really like hummus and this is one of our favorites.  I used 1/4 c of the oil from the tomatoes and 1/4 olive oil and really brought out the tomato taste.  We have friends who own a restaurant and they ahve been using the recipe for their appitizer.   They give credit to the poster though, thanks for this great recipe

Very disappointing on a number of levels- the flavor was off.  Not actually unpleasant, but off somehow.  My family did not like the texture- the nubbins of tomato made the humus seem gritty which was off-putting too.  Lastly, the color was strange- an unappetizing brownish-salmon with flecks of red and green.

I loved this hummus! It's so yummy! I also added a little more oil from the jar of tomatoes, as some of the people suggested was good. I omitted the garlic because I am intolerant to it. Don't know if this affected the hummus much or not.  I am a little worried about eating too much of it.   Thanks for the good recipe!!

Yummy taste, but still too thick.  didn't know how to thin it so mine turned out chunky.  I later added more oil that helped but still needs to be thinner.

This is the best hummus I've made from this site--soooo good! Only changes: halved recipe and only added about 2 tsp basil as I didn't want it to over-power the other flavors. Will definitely be making this again soon!

I only had one can of beans so I halved the recipe.  It is smooth and delicious!  I used the frozen cubes of basil from Trader Joe's, and will be making this for teacher gifts at the end of the year!  Any idea how long it will last in the refrigerator?

This was wonderful hummus, however,  I would recommend making it about 48 hours in advance, as it does take time for the flavors to meld and develop. After that, though, it's terrific!

My new favorite hummus!  I cooked my own garbanzo beans and I think the consistency was a little dry because of that.  So I had to add some water and significantly more olive oil...maybe a cup?  I love the fresh basil.  Excellent recipe!

Tasted better before I added the sun-dried tomatoes. I think I may have just had too much. I used a little oil from the tomatoes in place of some of the olive oil too. I also omitted the basil, so maybe using that would have balanced the flavors a little more. I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and didn't think it needed more.

My favorite hummus recipe yet! It was a hit @ our last gathering. I serve it with plain soft tortillas that I have cut up like a pie and then baked in a 350 deg. oven for 15 minutes. It's a good compliment because they aren't as salty.

I've made this many times, because I love making my own healthy snack food.  I've made it as submitted (5 star), but this time I halved the recipe (because it makes a lot for 1 person) and didn't drain my sun-dried tomatoes so I could use the oil they were in, and I used the juice from the garbanzo beans to thin to desired consistency, and since no fresh basil, used the Trader joe's frozen basil, and added cayenne pepper (cause I like spicy). Thanks for this wonderful recipe MARKCOZENZA!

Excellent - Followed directions with exception of substituting water for olive oil and did not add the fresh basil.  The flavors blended so well with nothing overpowering the others.  Will make again soon as it's one of the best hummus recipes I've tried, liked it even better than a great one on this site with roasted red peppers.

We thoroughly enjoyed this as an accompaniment to our salad dinner.  I didn't have oil packed sun-dried tomatoes, but substituted sun-dried tomatoes I reconstituted with a some boiling water.  I drained them before adding them to the mix.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, except to add a bit of the bean liquid to help with the consistency.  It was a nice change from the basic hummus recipe I've used in the past and reminiscent the flavored store bought varieties I've tried.

This recipe turned out great!  The dh loved it!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used peanut butter in place of tahini, did not drain the tomatoes, and used 1/4 sesame oil and 1/4 olive oil.  I also thinned the hummus to the desired consistency/smoothness by adding water as it pulsed in the food processor.  (Was a bit shocked the recipe didn't tell you to do this, so I can not give it 5 stars!)  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried.  Also added 1 tsp of cumin and an extra tsp of salt.  Topped with dried basil for appearance.  (Oh, be sure to wash the garbanzo beans off well in a drainer--helps reduce gas!)

Good, but I used double the amount of sundried tomatoes, plus the oil they were in instead of separate olive oil. Actually I used double of most of the other stuff too, maybe next time I will just use 1 can of garbanzo beans. I did not have fresh basil so I used dried.

I halved the recipe except for the garlic and kept everything as is, it was DELICIOUS!!!! Best hummus I have made in a while. I will bring this to gatherings for sure!!!

12/7/11 - halved the recipe again, except this time I used 1/4 C of sun dried tomatoes, 1 1/2 C fresh spinach, 1/4 C lemon juice, and only 2 TBS olive oil - the result punches a lot of flavor!!

This is a good spin on plain hummus, but I thought the 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes was extremely over-powering.  Next time I would use about half.

What a wonderful flavor this has!  I had a little trouble getting my food processor to process the tomatoes and basil into small pieces, so next time I will try adding them to the processor and then adding the beans last.

The recipe is great, but I think the olive oil could be lessened or possibly use a really good brand.  I just used the EVOO that I get from Costco and it had a little bit too much of that taste.

This is very flavorful hummus!  tip - if you use oil from jar of sun-dried tomatoes in lieu of olive oil, then you might want to ease up on the salt.

Absolutely amazing! It was delicious!  I didn't have tahini and didn't want to mess with it so I added a couple of splashes of sesame oil and it worked out perfectly! No one missed the taste and calories of the tahini.

I love this recipe.  Got ahold of some very pungent garlic that gave it quite a kick.  Used the olive oil from a jar of seasoned sun dried tomatoes for more flavor but must admit I used dried basil. I've made this a half dozen times recently and serve it on rice cakes.  It's healthy!

Fantastic recipe. I read a lot of the comments on this and made only mild changes. I used my food processor and just kind of started dumping stuff in! I didn't have all of the ingredients and sesame seeds really worked well. I doubled the amount of garlic, and added lemon juice to taste. What a great recipe for a healthy party snack!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this hummus. However, I did find mine to be a little dry. I don't think this is the recipe's fault, though, as it could have just been due to the particular can of beans I used. I wound up adding more lemon juice and some of the oil from the jar of sun dried tomatoes. The basil at the end gives it a very fresh flavor. I served it with vegetables and later used the leftovers as a sandwich spread. Some reviews mentioned difficulty getting the hummus smooth - I used a food processor and had no issue.

This is a fantastic recipe! We serve it with a drizzle of olive oil and some hot sauce - perfection!
It's not easy to sneak plant-based proteins into my little guy's diet (he calls himself a "meatatarian"), but he would eat this by the truckload if we let him. A delicious snack that's also a parenting win!

Very good but I think next time I will roast the garlic as someone else suggested. I will make this again because it is the best one I have tried to make so far. I would also add a bit of cayenne next time as I like it spicy.

I make this often and give it to friends, especially those who say they don’t like hummus, and they all go crazy over it. Homemade hummus is so much better than store bought. Serve it with some pita chips and it makes a delicious appetizer.

Absolutely yummy! It was my first time to make hummus and it was super easy with just a few ingredients. I ate it with red bell pepper, celery, small cherry yellow tomatoes, and English cucumber.

Even with a few ingredient compromises, this was a delicious recipe. I highly recommend it.

I made a few small changes due to my limited ingredient selection. 1) didn't use any tomatoes, 2) used about 2 teaspoons dried basil leaf flakes instead of fresh basil, 3) used equivalent amount of almond butter rather than tahini paste/butter, 4) added a dash of red pepper flakes for extra kick.

It is a very tasty hummus but lacked a bit on flavor for my taste. I added salt and a bit more lemon, I did not drain the tomatoes.
I could not get the hummus as smooth as usual but I can't believe it has anything to do with the recipe. The beans must have been more firm than usual.
I will definitely make it again.

I usually don't like hummus, but decided to try this for a couple events I needed to take an appetizer to. It was a hit both times! :) One tip -- I made this in my Vitamix. Next time I will use the food processor. I think it will mix the ingredients more evenly.

I left out the basil by accident, but it came out great anyway! It was a hit. I used a Ninja blender and was able to add all of the ingredients at once, except the sun-dried tomatoes. I didn't want to get the sun-dried tomatoes too chopped up, so I left it for last.

Very tasty!  I "lightened" it for a positive outcome, using 1 Tbsp sesame oil instead of tahini, rinsed the sun-dried tomatoes & used only 1/4 cup olive oil.  Reserve the liquid from the garbanzo beans, and add in a bit at a time to get the right consistency & blend!

this recipe is great!  much better than others i've found, and really very simple.  i added half of a jalapeno pepper for some extra spice, and used the plain, bagged sun-dried tomatoes to save money...they are much cheaper than the ones packed in oil.  this did require a little more olive oil, but it was totally worth it!  thanks for a great recipe!

I did an 8-serving batch with a few slight modifications, and found this great!  I only used one clove of garlic, and instead of the 1/4 cup olive oil, I used 2 tablespoons of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes and about 1/2 the liquid from the beans as other posts suggested.  Also, I did only one tablespoon of dried basil flakes because I didn't have fresh basil.  Will definitely make this one again!

I doubled the recipe and followed directions exactly.  This was awful! After spending a lot of money for the ingredients and the time spent blending together, I was very disappointed.  I bought store made and it was totally different.  The store bought was creamy.  This recipe was dry and clumpy.

I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but my hummus was very dry. It had an ok flavor, but the texture was not quite right. I probably won't make this again.

This was my first try at hummus and it didn't turn out too great.  It either had too much garlic (I used what the recipe stated) or my garlic was bad?  The consistency was too thick and the taste just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure I'll make this again.

Very good recipe! This is my first try . My baby loves Mediterranean food, especailly hummus. I tried to buy hummus from Costco in Fremont, and he hates it very much.This time he gives my hummus a five star!! Thanks for your recipe. It is wonderful, I definitely make it again.

use 1/4 cup olive oil and red pepper instead of paprika.
