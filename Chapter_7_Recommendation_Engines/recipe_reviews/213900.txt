This was really good. I made it exactly as directed except for using low-fat mayo and dried parsley instead of fresh, and I didn't know what to expect, but it turned out great. For the Cajun spice, I used the "Cajun Spice Mix" from this site (minus salt) and I think it worked well. I served the chicken with steamed broccoli, and even using some of the "Creole mustard sauce" on the broccoli, we had about half of the dipping sauce left after all the chicken was gone. So next time I might halve that.

Really good, fixed it exactly as directed. The chicken didn't dry out and maintained a subtle flavor.

This was very flavorful.  I had to cook the chicken about twice as long as the recipe recommended, though.

I saw this on TV, and looked up the recipe online to see if I could find it to send to a friend, without having to type the whole thing out. So glad to have found it on my favorite recipe site! :) I made this for dinner tonight, and used a Creole Spice that I found at the Dollar Tree of all places. It turned out really good. My daughter loved it, but didn't like the sauce, which I expected. I am wishing I had made more, because I think it would make really good leftover chicken sandwiches, using the dipping sauce instead of plain mayo. In fact, I think I'll do that anyway, and just use lunch meat tomorrow. Anyway, rambling aside, I really liked this recipe, and highly recommend it.
