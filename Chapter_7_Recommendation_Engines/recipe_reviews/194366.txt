This is delicious! I made in individual servings by using a muffin pan lined with cupcake holders for easy removal. I really enjoyed the chocolate cream part of this dessert, probably because I have an extreme sweet tooth. I found the dessert overall to be just right in the sweetness department - for my taste buds anyway. Will definitely make this again.

It didn't turn out to be what I was thinking. The Cool Whip layer is too thick, I'd use less or mix more in with the chocolate. I agree with another review that you could use half the chocolate too. Also make SURE the cream cheese is room temp. otherwise it will not mix well with the Cool Whip.

This is very good - the bottom layer (the chocolate layer) gets very hard once frozen, so 30 minutes out to thaw before cutting would definately be a good thing. I also think the recipe calls for way too much chocolate... I used half as much and it turned out fine. Yum!

I thought it was very good and tastes a lot like Sara lee cookies and cream cheesecake bites which I love.
