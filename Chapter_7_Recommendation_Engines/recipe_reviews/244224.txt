The only change I made was with the milk. I didn't have enough fresh milk, so I mixed in powdered milk, a bit of cold water, and ice cubes, to thicken it up a bit more. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I like my smoothies thick and frosty. So good and no added sugar, which is definitely a plus for me! My kids loved it, too, even my daughter who has a sweet tooth didn't ask to sweeten it any more.

2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1000mg  cinnamon 
1 tablespoon coffee flavored or chocolate protein powder

For me, unsweetened cocoa powder made this smoothie taste like medicine.

Perfect for post-workout or a quick on-the-go breakfast. I used almond milk as suggested in the Cook's Notes and subbed stevia for the honey. Delicious!
