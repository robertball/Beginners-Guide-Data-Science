not sure why only the one star, I served this on New Year's Eve and everyone loved it. I used the salad topping slivered almonds from package and also packaged bacon bits, it was very good.  Would make again.

Yum! I loved the bold use of black pepper and celery seed in this dressing. It was a bit too sweet for me, so I would hold back a little on the sugar, but it worked well with the salad as written, too. The recipe makes a ton of dressing - I halved it and still ended up with quite a bit, so you may want to cut it to 1/3 until you are sure you like it enough to use on more salads. Excellent fruit/nut/veggie/bacon combo! Thanks for the recipe!

Only reason I did not give this a 5 is because I listened to the other reviews on the sweetness and cut the sugar in half and was pleased with the result.  Can't imagine using all the sugar called for.  This dressing is excellent and goes perfectly on this salad.  Was enjoyed by all.  Thanks for sharing Sarah!

I loved this! It diffently is sweet, so next time I'll cut back on the sugar. I just used a Spring Salad Mix, and put the mushrooms and oranges in there, I didn't have almonds. so I just srinkled some chopped pecans I had. I'm going to be making this again.

Recipe received 5 stars from 19-year old son and hubby (and me).  This makes for a pleasant break from the usual lettuce, tomato, and cucumber green salad.  I did increase the mustard and used about 1/3 the amount of sugar called for and it was still plenty sweet.  Also slivered some red onion into the salad instead of using them in the dressing.  We loved the taste combination of ingredients and the color was terrific.  Worked well with both grilled chicken and steak.  Rounded out both meals with brown and serve sourdough bread.  I think it would work to also add some feta cheese if you wanted a heartier salad.  Thanks, Sarah, for sharing Glenda's recipe.  It is terrific!

Great salad we all loved. I cut the dressing ingredients in half and found it to be plenty and used walnut oil. I also cut way back on the sugar and still decided to give it 5 stars, because we are just fans of less sugar in pretty much all recipes, and I believe a lot of people would not think the dressing was too sweet made with the original sugar amount. I used sliced red onion in the salad instead of adding reg. onion to the dressing. Will make this again for sure.

Excellent recipe. Just made it for a church picnic and I  know I'll  be making again and again. I used homegrown  Romaine lettuce from my garden as well as sweet Vadellia onions! I added strawberries since they're  in season here in Florida.  Also added raisins n tortilla strips for a more crunchy taste. I made recipe for 12 servings but did cut back on onions and sugar. To save me time I cut the lettuce the night before placed in covered dish, made dressing in separate bowl as directed too but didn't add to lettuce until this morning. So colorful!
