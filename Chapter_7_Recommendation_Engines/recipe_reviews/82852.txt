This was very good. I made it with some of my leftover spiral ham. It has a nice taste.

Excellent!! I recieved a new stand up mixer with grinder attachment for x-mas and had to try this. My mom used to make this buget saving recipe when the 3 of us kids were younger. I used sweet relish.  I grinded the onion with the grinder. I even bought the sara lee bread. Yum!! This would make some great appetizers served stuffed in celery, or on shape cut bread with a garnish on top.

I didn't love this one.  I'm sure it's a fine recipe for Ham Spread but I found it too salty and just not that tasty.  I think the ham is salty enough on it's own and the addition of mustard, which adds a salty taste, just puts it over the top.
