This meal was a huge hit a one of my family get togethers and i made sixty patties and not a single one was left at the end of the night. The only thing i'm going to do different is dip the patties in flour first then the egg and flour again because most of the flour washed off in the grease the first time

This is great! There is no need for 1 cup flour and 4 eggs. a 1/2 cup flour and 2 eggs are sufficient. I added a 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper when making the gravy. I served this with potato pancakes and fried eggs.

Wow!  This is a GREAT recipe - I loved having something different to do with ground beef.  Definitely be heavy on the salt and pepper though - I added it to the ground beef, to the eggs, and to the gravy.

As other reviewers have stated, this was great! I didn't have any milk so used 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup with a bit of water to thin. I warmed it in the same pan and it browned wonderfully & tasted great.

This rather reminds me of the meat pattie DQ uses for their DQ Dude sandwich. Not bad at all. Kids love it! Wouldn't change a thing on it. Try it on a hamburger bun with mayo, lettuce and tomato.

These weren't bad at all.  May try again and add some steak seasoning to the meat before cooking.  Used only 2 eggs and it was plenty.

Wow! My kids and I loved this! We used steak and flattened it using a meat mallet instead of ground beef.  The steak came out tender and the breading was crisp and flavorful.  We will be eating this again :)

I just finished making this and it was absolutely wonderful!  I did add salt and pepper to everything from mixing the burgers, the eggs, the flour and the gravy.  This was so easy, I will be making again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was tasty...I would give it about 4.5 stars.  I had some problems with the breading...maybe I just didn't cook it long enough, but something was "off" about it.  Overall, great taste!

I have made this many times and it is always a huge hit with the family.  I follow the recipe directly, but double the gravy recipe. Goes great with mashed potatoes

The only change I would make is less batter, you don't need it. Otherwise, this meal turned out amazing!

i used 1/3 lb angus beef patties. I did not precook the patties. I added generous amounts of seasoned salt, garlic powder,  plus cayenne and pepper to the flour mixture.     I cooked in 1/2 inch canola oil at medium high heat.   We loved it.  I will definitely make again.

Oh boy!  Can't wait to have this again!  My husband and I loved it!  The only change I made was to use 100% wholewheat flour, otherwise, followed it to a T!  Heavenly and satisfying!
Fantastic recipe, and so thrilled to have this in our regular rotation now!  Thank you so much, Cookie Moster!

This was very good! Usually I do all the cooking, but my hubby made this one for me! He had trouble w/ the breading falling off, but I don't think he dipped the meat in the flour b4 dipping it in the egg. Still tho, so very simple & so yummy. He also added kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder & a little cayenne upon my request (: Seasonings are definitely your friends here!

This sure does help with my budget and it is really good.  The only problem I had was that I got flour all over the kitchen, which was my fault.  I also followed the advice to dip the patties in the egg before putting the coated steaks on to fry so that the flour would stay on better.

The meat patties themselves were very good, but the gravy wasn't very good. It may have been because i used an iron skillet, but i didn't like the gravy on the patties at all. I ended up just eating it on a hamburger bun.

This was very good. I did do it my own way though. I used more seasonings ( onion powder, cayenne pepper) in the flour. I also used organic flour and fried it in coconut oil. I will be making this again!!!

Brilliant idea to use ground beef. So much easier, cheaper, tastes just as good. Did flour, egg, then flour again. Refrigerated covered an hour or so before frying to avoid the frustration of loose coating. Great!

While it was easy to make, it smelled better than it tasted and I used a lot of salt and pepper. Even after fully cleaning up and emptying the trash  it just stunk up the house for the next day and a half.   I wouldn't make this again.  Maybe others have better luck and would enjoy it more.

The kids loved it and even asked for seconds!  I used ground chicken instead of hamburger and dredged in whole wheat flour instead of regular flour.  I also made the gravy with lowfat milk!! I used 2 lbs of ground chicken made them into patties seasoned them with a variety of spices and pan fried them.  Then cooled them, dredged them and back in the pan.  I will definitely make this one again!!

This was ok, but not much flavor. Bland hamburger, and bland breading. So I seasoned the hamburger with season salt, Worcestershire and fresh crack black pepper, same with eggs, same with flour, so it should have been over seasoned. But it was still kind of blah. I dont know what it needs, but it needs something. I will figure it out, and fix it. I bet it would be good with ground pork instead of beef.

I enjoyed making this because it was messy and entertaining but the second I took a bite, I regretted wasting my ingredients to make it! I was so disgusted with this dish. I am just glad that I decided to make it for myself and not my family the first time.

Really good cfs, not like the one I had at Chilis, but then....This is made with hamburger meat.  It's definitely worth making again!

The Only Changes For This Would Try For Leaner Ground Beef If On Sale. Less Eggs Whole.Prehaps 2 Eggs & 2 Whites.Use 2% Milk In Place Of Whole Milk & You Are There!
