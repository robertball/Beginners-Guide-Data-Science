You're going to love this recipe.  We made it with grape jelly and spaghetti sauce for years but wait till you try it with picante sauce...wow.  I had grave doubts but just dive in and you will have rave reviews.  The kind that has you making this recipe over and over again.  Enjoy!

The whole thing can be finished and served via crock pot. To get the meat to hold together, add another egg or simply use purchased meatballs. Grape jelly is usually cheapest but others work also. I cut down on the jelly ratio because we try and limit sugar intake. The all-fruit types with no added sugar need to be blended smooth (depending on brand) before you can use them and they tend to not glaze up as nicely but still taste good.

I have made this sauce for years, and it's great!  I use equal parts of the grape jelly & Picante Sauce (medium heat).  It doesn't have to be exact measurements, but close to equal measurements for both.  I haven't used the thyme.

I make these for most family gatherings. I have never tried with Picante sauce , I have always just used Chili sauce and 1 1/2 cups of Grape Jelly. I also make them in a crockpot cooking for 4 hours.I am going to try this variation and choose a winner. Thanks

This is a copy cat recipe with the same result as the easier original. Most use store bought meatballs with grape jelly or cranberry sauce combimed with chili sauce. That said it is a good tasting end product. I have done the original using store bought and also homemade so I give it a rating.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE. I WILL USE  IT FOR A FAMILY GATHERING ON NEW YEARS. I WILL USE APRICOT JAM INSTEAD OF GRAPE. I THINK THE FLAVOR OF PICANTE SAUCE AND APRICOT WILL BLEND VERY WELL.                                   R C CHULA VISTA,CA.

These were ok. They had this same recipe in next to a coupon in the paper a couple weeks ago. The meatballs didn't hold very well so I think they need more bread crumbs or something. The sauce was good though and very simple.

These were really tasty, and we enjoyed dipping them into the "Buffalo Chicken Dip" here on AR.  I found this recipe did not need the egg as after adding the sauce and jelly, the mixture was very moist.  An egg would have done more harm than good, so I opted to leave it out.  The meatballs formed and stuck together great.  I did add salt and pepper.  Bonus points for ease!

I've had the grape jelly meatballs before, but not nice and spicy like this recipe. I made them last year for our family New Years Eve party and everyone loved them! I am making them again this year, sooo good!!

Good enough recipe..tasted good (not great) and was easy.  I would use Hot vs. medium salsa next time.   Medium didn't create enough heat and flavour for me.
