I've been making this for years, but I use only one Tbsp of oil.  This helps the white chocolate to retain a bit more of a "chocolate" consistency.  I also substitute Peanut candy-coated chocolate pieces because my family just can't get enough of the nuts.  You can substitute Valentines, Easter, 4th of July and Fall colored candy pieces to adapt this to any holiday or season.  Great alternative to traditional snack mixes.

This was the best Christmas snack I've ever made!  Following someone else's suggestion, I reduced the amount of oil just a bit.  I used holiday-shaped pretzels with the green and red M&Ms.  I also used golden grahams cereal to add a little extra sweetness to go with the salty of the peanuts and pretzels.  I couldn't put it down.

I make this recipe with Christmas tree shaped pretzels, and red and green M & M's.  When tied into a cellophane bag and inserted into a festive container, this makes a tasty, inexpensive and personal gift!  I also print the recipe on a recipe card and slip it into the container, since everyone always asks for the recipe.

I have given this snack mix as Christmas gifts two years in a row now.  I always get people raving about it.  I absolutely love it too and have difficulty stopping myself from eating all of it when I'm making it!  I usually add about 1/2 package more of the white chocolate chips just to cut down on the oil and cover everything better.  I also spread my whole kitchen table with waxed paper (I tape it to the table with tape) and just dump this stuff out on it to cool.  Then, just throw away the paper when you're done!  Makes clean-up easier, I think!  This is good stuff -- you can't go wrong with it!

I found the chocolate coating to be kind of wet or greasy even after letting it set up.  I ended up putting the mix back into the bowl and tossing it all with a little powdered sugar.  It fixed the greasy problem and still tasted good.  I loved the sweet and salty combination, but next time I won't add 3T of oil to the chocoalate chips.

I love this mis and make it all the time. Since my time is limited, I have adapted it to my "busy mom" schedule. I buy the foil snack bags of Traditional Chex Mix and add in extras like M&M's, peanuts, crusehd up candy bar. The bag already has the pretzels and the seasoning is wonderful. If I can find the white bark I use that, if not, then white chocolate chips work great.

Delicious recipe Sue. Everyone loved the sweet and salty mix. However I expected the chocolate to cover the ingredients completely. Next time I will double the chocolate, the pretzels, and peanuts because those were everyon's favorite part. I will definately make again and plan to add them to my Christmas gift baskets.

This is the one I have been looking for!  It is utterly addictive.  Makes a ton of snack mix.  I used christmas mix m&m's and square pretzels.  Filled disposable decorating bags with it and tied at the base with red and green ribbons to give as office gifts.  Resembles snow covered Christmas trees.

This was excellent! I had a little extra of the cereal, pretzels, etc so I used them up - but after reading the reviews I decided to also melt a package of "swirled" peanut butter/chocolate chips.  Mixed them in first, then did the white chocolate as directed.  Used giant m & m's because i had them on hand.  It was simple, easy enough clean up and really tasty - the sweet/salty thing is addictive.

Excellent recipe for White Trash!  The only adjustment I made was to cut back on the oil.  I only used 1 Tbsp instead of 3.  Also, I found that if I divide the ingredients into 2 bowls and add a little bit of the white chocolate at a time it is easier to cover it all.  So pour a little on, stir, pour on more white choc, stir, etc.  until covered.

I made this for my son's birthday party and it was a huge hit!!  Everyone loved it.  It's hard to stop eating!  This is a HUGE recipe though.  It filled 3 cookie sheets.  So you may want to cut the recipe down if you don't need that much.  I will definitely make this again.

My family loves this mix! I use 1 pound of vanilla candy coating instead of white chocolate chips. When you use the candy coating you can leave out the oil.

Wow, was this good!  (And easy!)  Made enough for an army!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, and it was perfect.  Red & green M&M's make it festive for Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe!

3.5/5 stars.  I was so excited to find this recipe because a woman at my church always made a similar mix when I was a kid and I absolutely loved it.  I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe because there is simply not enough chocolate to coat all the ingredients--and I used two FOURTEEN oz. bags of choc. chips plus the listed 3 tbsp of oil!  I'm going to try adding at least     another half bag and see if it's better.

I used all of the oil and followed the directions exactly well except my m&m package i bought was shy a  ounce or so. I had absolutely no problems with the white chocolate mixture not covering all of the cereal. Perhaps people are having issues because they are cutting the oil in the chocolate mixture but just a guess I haven't tried it with the reduced oil.  This makes a ton of it. Next time I might make a half batch if its just for the family. We are including little baggies of it on our Christmas cookie platters.  Delicious and addictive thanks!!!

I brought this for Thanksgiving and it was a BIG hit!  I had to microwave the chocolate a bit longer, and I added more M&M's and pretzels than called for.  This was so good, I think I've started a new tradition.

Everyone has their additions, but here's an EASY and EXCELLENT one: I use pretzel sticks, because they are easier to eat in the same bite with something sweet.  AND EVERYONE HAS TO TRY ADDING SOME CARAMEL!  When I was getting the white chocolate chips, I found some little caramel pieces in the same section.  Added a little less MnMs with over half a bag of caramel, and a LITTLE bit extra pretzel sticks and salted peanuts to complement the extra sweetness.

Great snack. I cut the oil in half as suggested and it wasn't oilly at all. Put it in the fridge to make the chocolate harden more quickly.

Absolutely Amazing!  I made about 8 different holiday treats--some extremely time consuming--and this was the recipe that everyone asked for!  I too cut the oil down to 1 tbsp and added honey nut cheerios as well.  This made a lot which was great since it was so popular.

I made this for Christmas last year for my brother who was stationed in Iraq with the Army. It shipped well in gallon ziplock bags and the guys loved it. I added corn chips as we like sweet and salty! Making it again this year. :) Christmas Crack for sure! Can't stop eating it!!

This is such a great recipe, my 9 year old son was eating this and held up a piece of the mix and said "This is amazing."  I think that sums it up right there!  This is a receipe that I will keep always. Right after I shared it with my friends they were asking for the recipe.  The variety of items to use in it are just wonderful and so easy to make.  I recommend this recipe to everyong!

This was good. BUT....our family still prefers the sweet snack mix.  It is the same base ingredients, but instead of white chocolate coating, it is a caramel mixture. (3 c brown sugar, 1.5 c butter, 1/2 c corn suyrp boiled together for 3 min)

Awesome recipe and so easy!  In an effort to save dishwashing, I guesstimate the proportions and just dump all the ingredients in a paper grocery bag and stir/shake it up with the white chocolate. The only dish you have to wash is the small bowl & spoon that you heat the white chocolate in!

This was easy and pretty good.  Looked pretty for Christmas using red & green M&M's.  Would use white chocolate candy coating instead of the white chips and oil as this mixture made the coating to "wet" and the mix didn't dry.  I had to add powdered sugar to dry it out some.

Love the salty/sweet combo. Can be made gluten free with changes in cereal; used rice and corn chex, with a few GF pretzel sticks. Also substituted a deluxe nut mix for the peanuts as I gave bags in a Christmas assortment. Well liked, easy to make.

Great recipe to make for Christmas snack bags. Had several people ask me for the recipe. Be sure to have a big pan or bowl. It is hard to mix if the bowl is too small.

Very good!  Very easy to make also.  I melted my white chocolate chips in a double boiler and followed the suggestion of some others in using only 1 Tbsp. oil and cutting the cereal down to 3 cups of each.  Coated all ingredients very nicely!  Thanks, Sue!

OMG!  This recipe is to die for! Easy, Fast, Excellent.  Don't have corn chex? add rice chex, no plain cheerioes? use multi-grain cheerios...just add 3c each of cereal not 5, then the 2 pkgs of white choc chips is plenty adequate.  You've got to make this recipe! This is 5 stars all the way!!

Very good.  I cut the recipe in half, and then reduced the cereal amounts to 1 1/2 cups each.  It was just the right amount to have everything coated with the white chocolate.

Three packets of white chocolate chips should be used;  two packets coats everything OK, but not great.  And use a shallow and big bowl; deep bowl makes it hard to coat melted chocolate into items on very bottom.  And it took four 10 second microwave heatings to melt the chocolate into a smooth mixture.

This is really good!  Made some for two family get together and they were a big hit every time.  If you make it for others bring printed recipes because they will ask for it.  Next time I make it I will use a little less oil as some of the reviews suggested.  BTW, this is a very big recipe....it makes lots!

This is ADDICTIVE!!  One of my FAVORITES!!  A friend made this and I wanted to ask her for the recipe, but didn't because I know I can't keep myself away from it.  I came across it on here though and made it with peanut M&Ms - DELICIOUS!!

Delicious snack!  I cut down on the M and Ms and pretzels, and added Sugar Babies for a little caramel touch.  I like it with lightly salted almonds in place of peanuts.

Love this recipe. My family calls it Reindeer Chow. It's a great holiday snack to have around the house or to bring to school/office parties as it makes a massive amount. It's easy to half if you're feeding a smaller crowd. Thanks!

I love this recipe. I made it many times last year and gave it out as gifts to everyone. I also love the salt/sugar mix. I like it better with only 3 cups each of the cereals and extra nuts. There is enough white chocolate then to coat the ingredients. I used Christmas shaped pretzels and holiday M&Ms.

This recipe took all of 5 minutes to make, not including cool time.  I put the entire snack in the teachers' lounge at school in the morning.  It was gone by lunch!  Lots of compliments on the recipe.

I love this! I've been making a similar recipe for a few years, but mine uses more cereal & 2 bags of white chips. Makes a gigantic amount--almost 2 gallon ziploc bagfuls. Once you start munching, you'll have to have someone pull you away. Very, very addicting stuff.

This turned out great, though it does make a TON.  I doubled the peanuts and I could have tripled them.  These are also great with Reese's Pieces instead of M & Ms.  I also followed the tips and used Golden Grahams instead of the corn squares.  Everyone loved it!

I add Cheetos Butter Puffcorn (1 bag) to the mix and use peanut butter M&M's for the candy. I also substitute the corn chex with Chocalate Chex Cereal. Also, cashews taste better to my family than the peanuts. I love that it makes a HUGE amount...just perfect for keeping AND giving! FYI: Use the largest bowl you have to mix it in.

I've already reviewed this once, it is an excellent and easy snack. However, I meant to make a note ... leave out the M&Ms! You just don't need them. It really makes it too sweet.

I found this a little challenging to mix up and pour out.  I used a few cookies sheets.  It did not look pretty when all was said and done but it made a ton and people seemed to really enjoy it.  I don't think I will make this again though..

I had this at a Christmas party and wanted to make it myself, so I was pleased to find the recipe here. You can't go wrong with this, everyone loves it. I was making mine for a crowd that included a couple of kids allergic to peanuts, so I left those out. I don't care for peanuts myself, so next time I'll try pecan pieces. Oh, and I forgot to use green and red M&Ms (for Christmas), but I'm not sure anyone noticed. Also, a couple of people commented that they used less vegetable oil in the chocolate. I wouldn't advise that, because even with what's called for it's tricky getting it to spread all over the pieces really well...and the consistency and taste were perfect, so I'm not sure why anyone would want to change that. Try it, it's guaranteed to be a big hit!

My husband and I love this stuff.  Instead of using white chocolate chips, we use bars of white chocolate (can be found at Aldi) and omit the vegetable oil.  Good white chocolate melts a lot more smoothly than the chips.

This stuff is hands-down addictive.  I made 4 batches and packaged in bags as Christmas presents.  3 of the people literally finished off the bag while I was still at their house.  
I followed some other suggestions and reduced white chocolate to 1 & 1/2 bags, rather than 2 full.  I also used a mix of peanut and regular M&Ms.  It helps if you have someone to help stir while you pour the white chocolate over the other ingredients.  Also, do NOT use regular chocolate instead!!  I tried this on the last batch, because I ran out of white chocolate.  It does not taste as good, and it never hardens correctly so your hands get all gooey when you try to eat it.
Try this snack mix - but only if you really want something you can't stay away from!

This is delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as given, with the single change of using the double-boiler method for melting the white chocolate and reducing the oil to 1 tablespoon.  A perfect recipe for giving at Christmastime!  Thanks!

Really good recipe - I used white chocolate wafers instead of the white chocolate chips and melted them using a double boiler (or bowl on top of a pan with boiling water).  I find the microwave doesn't work well for melting white chocolate chips.  I also only used 1 tbsp oil, that's all you need.  AND I used cornflakes and shredddies for the cereals instead.  Very good!

I followed the recipe as is except for 1 addition: Mix and melt 2 bags of white chocolate chips with Andes peppermint (or creme de menthe) baking chips. It will change the color, but it adds a nice flavor! YUM! Disappears quickly during football games!

I gave this 5 stars because it does taste great. I however had a hard time melting the white chocolate. I finally had to add more oil to get it to smooth out and pour. I'm not sure what went wrong for me, but when I finally got it mixed up, it was delicious.

Made this for 2 of my Christmas parties this year and displayed in a tin with shiny tissue paper. Was a hit and so easy that I made some to give out as gifts. So, SO simple and fast! But do be sure and let it air out on the wax paper before you package it up or it will stick together. Even now, on New Year's Eve, I find myself "craving" it and wondering should I make more...

This is DELICIOUS!Our children love it! It will be a new Christmas tradition. I didn't have any toasted oat cereal, so I left it out and just used 5 cups corn chex. I took the advice of others and used 1 TBSP of oil and spread on the counter to cool.I sprinkled lots of red and green sprinkles to make it more festive.Thank you!

I've been making this stuff for years! It's even easier and faster when you use almond bark or white bark instead of chocolate chips & oil. I also use raisins in it and save your baking sheets, just spread a long piece of wax paper on the counter and spread it out to dry. Make the layer thin and it will dry faster if you're in a hurry! It's just as good with chocolate if you don't care for white chocolate.

This is a pretty good snack, but not as great as I was expecting after all the rave reviews. I made it for video night, next time I'll go with caramel popcorn or something a little more treat like.

I also have been making this for years. I put it in treat bags for friends at Christmas, and I change up my seasonal m&ms for party bowls throughout the year. My recipe is exactly the same except calls for 2T of oil. It has always turned out just right. I mix it in the big bowl from Tupperware- it's the perfect size.

Excellent! As recommended by others, I cut down on the oil to 1 1/2 Tbsp. Perfect! My 11 y.o. daughter made this by herself and we bagged it up and added to our Christmas baskets. Very pretty and festive, especially since she added tons more holiday M&Ms!!

With or without the nuts works too.  Peanut M&Ms didn't work so well. This is very well liked by all.

This was a huge hit at my husband's office.  I found the double boiler method of melting the white chocolate easier and used 2 teaspoons of oil.  Turned out great.

I can't stop eating this stuff, it's so simple yet so good. I did use white almond bark with this batch because the store was sold out of white chocolate chips. I like it better with the chips but the bark worked in a pinch and was less costly.

Scrumptious, everyone loved it.  I reduced the amount of cereal (10 cups is a lot!), since we like more chocolate flavor.  Also reduced the oil a bit, and it was fine.  I simply spread wax paper over the countertop instead of bothering with baking sheets, and stored it in ziploc bags.

Very easy to do.  I left out the extra cereals and cut down on the white chocolate as I was looking for something more like Pretzel flipz.  I added sprinkles to it once it was laid on on the aluminum foil.  That made it look pretty and gave it a nice crunch.

This tastes great!  The only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are too many pretzels and not enough chocolate to cover the ingredients.  It also made way more than what I was expecting.  Will try making again, but will adjust the amount of ingredients.

Love this! I half the oil and use lucky charms and apple jacks in place of half the Chex and honey nut Cheerios.  I also have used honey roasted peanuts which were yum! I'm not a fan of this with m&m's so I chop up candy bars, snickers are my fave, but I've used all sorts and combinations and heck to the yeah...'lish,

I read the reviews before I made this.
I noticed that there's a lot of disagreement regarding how much oil to use.
Folks who have been cooking a long time know that there are variables in any recipe- things like humidity in your kitchen, how long your white chocolate chips have been sitting on your pantry shelf, etc- that can affect how much oil you may need to add.
My white chocolate chips (a 24 oz bag) had been opened previously & sat for a year before I used them to make this recipe.
I started out adding half the oil, then the other half, then switching to melting on the stove in a pan to avoid chocolate seizing, & finally, adding a lot more oil.  I seriously lost track- maybe a total of 1/2 cup of oil over all before I could get the chocolate close to smooth & not clunky.  
Does this mean that this recipe failed me?
No, this means my chocolate had lost a lot of its moisture in the past year sitting on my pantry shelf, & that I needed to add more oil to get it to work.
Once I glopped it (not poured it, it was still rather thick) into the other ingredients it mixed well & looked a lot thinner.
So much so that I worried, as I smoothed the mix onto wax paper, that is might not dry- AT ALL.
But it DID!  It dried despite my having to add all that oil to get the chocolate workable.
& I just snuck a taste- it is scrumptious!!!
I wanted to post this because we need to realize as cooks, that there are variables in your kitchen & ingredients & it may not be the fault of the recipe.

I scaled this down to 3 servings, and it was more than enough.  Used raw peanuts instead of salted because that is all I had in the house.  This is very good and very easy to make.  I didn't find it to be the "couldn't stop eating it" concoction, but I like it.

This is good but M & Ms are overkill.  If I make it again I will leave them out!  Made a mistake and grabbed salted dry roasted peanuts. Regular would have been better but dry roasted are not terrible and would save calories. Be careful--it's addictive.

Yummy, it makes a large batch, used them for goodie bags for Christmas. I added the Cran-raisins, accidently used Rice Squares instead of Corn. You really need the salted peanuts, (I only had plain nuts). It really tastes good when you have that sweet vs salty thing going on. I also used 2lb block of Almond Bark, Vanilla Flavored (since I didn't have the chips) melted great in the microwave. I did not add the oil.

I don't like white chocolate so I used the peanut butter chocolate chips instead.  I've made it several times and find it works much better if you leave out the oil.  With the oil it never really set.  Great flavor.  When I make it for the kids they gobble it up fast.

I just made this for the first time. I took it to my church youth christmas party. First of all, it was hard getting it out of the house, my husband wanted me to leave it all home, so after I set some aside for him, I took it to the party and everyone was talking about it. What was still left was taken home by a lucky few, and I'm printing copies of the recipe for them as we speak.

Very good and easy.  Nice snack mix with good assortment of flavors.  I halved the recipe and it made PLENTY and I added the peanut butter m&ms.  Yum!

This is huge hit at our house. Like others I just line my kitchen table with wax paper and let it cool. I also substitute 2 12-oz bags of peanut butter M&M's instead of the plain ones and use dry roasted nuts instead. And yes, like the previous posters I cannot put it down once I start munching. Definitely a party food, otherwise I'd eat the whole thing myself.

A hit with everyone at the party!  I followed the original directions, and this turned out perfectly.  I wouldn't change a thing(except maybe more m&m's- cause I love them!) I'm not a fan of white choc. chips, but I still loved this.  Unfortunately, I couldn't quit eating it! No need to change a thing. Ingredient amounts just right.

Oh, yum! I like salty but not sweet and my husband likes sweet but not salty. We both LOVED this! I reduced the oil to 1 Tb. as well and it set up perfectly and I used Reese's Pieces since I'm not an m&m's fan. The bonus was it looked nice and "fallish" for my daughter's late October birthday party. I'll be making a Christmas version to hand out to neighbors for sure! One note: this makes a TON. I mean like as in three large cookie-sheets full, fills 2 gallon sized freezer bags when done kind of a ton. It was pretty difficult to stir it all together, so I'd suggest you plan on halving the recipe into at least two bowls and use the biggest scooper/scraper you own.

Made this for a company function, everybody went back for seconds and thirds, people who don't even like white chocolate went back for seconds.  I put a little orange colored vanilla chocolate in to give a little fall color.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I cut the oil waaaayyy back....to 1 T.  Heated stove top in a nonstick fry pan...the first batch fine...the second batch...white chocolate went "chalky" (quick)...fixed with adding more oil being careful not to "burn" the chocolate...got it to a spreadable consistency...it turned out good.  Was told the chalky was due to the heat being too high...so...use a double boiler or use microwave (yuck) or low low heat in heavy bottom pan...  Also...added nuts, dried apricots...substituted rice chex for cheerios.  It was ALL good!

I try to make this addictive party mix for neighbor's gifts each Christmas.  I went with a review and only use 1 T of oil and I like to use more chocolate so I use 1 1/2 or 2 times the amount.  Everyone raves how good it is!  Thank you for sharing.

This makes great and easy gifts. The large-sized bags of the ingredients made a recipe and a half for me and made 12 generous gift portions. You can also substitute butterscotch morsels for a little variety.

This turned out really really yummy.  I left out the nuts because they are a choking hazard for my toddler.  I cereals I used were Cheerios and Crispix  (latter being a little crumbly while breaking it up).  If you like sweet things, than you will like this.  My father said it was too sweet and my husband said it wasn't his thing.  I think they're both nuts lol.  I made it a Friday night for our Sunday party.  All day Saturday, I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl. :-P

Okay it was a 5 BUT I took a few suggestions  I only added 1 TBSP of quality oil to the Ghirardelli white chocolate, , lightly salted cashews instead of peanuts , 3 cups golden Graham's (reducing Cheerios and  corn Chex ) then added 2 cups of ROYAL ICING  made with pure almond  extract (4 cups powder sugar, 1 TBSP almond extract,  1/3 cup water,  3 TBSP meringue powder)  after I mixed, broke up  and let the regular recipe dry.

I absolutely love this recipe. I used cocktail nuts because they are a bit softer. I also added rice crispy cereal. This form makes alot.

Absolutely delicious and completely addicting! I used cashews, rice chex, pretzels and m&m's as that's what I had on hand. This is a foolproof recipe!

Don't use Ghiradelli white chocolate chips,I think they add a weird flavor.  
I didn't much care for this mix, maybe it was because of the Ghiradelli, but I definately would have rather just made white chocolate covered pretzels.  It was just okay, nothing special.

This is great!  Used 9 cups of the cereals, total, 2C pretzels, 14oz party peanuts, candy corn & festive m&m's, and one bag of Hershey's white chips.  Add the candy just before laying out onto wax paper.  Just enough coverage of the white chocolate. Thanks Sue.
