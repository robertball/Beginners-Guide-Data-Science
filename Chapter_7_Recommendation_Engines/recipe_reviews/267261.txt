This was so good! I used smoked turkey instead of ham and cut back on the salt.

Made exactly as directed, and it was delicious! I made this earlier in the day, and left it in my Instant Pot until dinner time. When it was time to reheat, I turned my IP on saute for a few minutes, then switched to slow cook on high, and it reheated in about 10 minutes, while I boiled some ditalini pasta on the stove to add to it. Even though it was 90 degrees outside, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this! Will definitely make this again!

What a delicious soup!  Because I had recently made split pea & ham soup, I decided to go with hot Italian turkey sausage.  I browned the sausage with olive oil, then added the onions, carrots and celery and sauté until most of the liquid evaporated, then on with the rest of the recipe as written.

Man o’ man, one of the best lentil soups I have ever made!  It’s a definite keeper and it will be the only one I will make from now on.

I had everything on hand for this and used up our ham from New Year’s Day. 
I followed the recipe. I’ll probably use less salt next time, depending on how salty the ham tastes. 
My family loved this, including my 6-year-old granddaughter.  
I served it with cornbread. 
Will definitely make this again!

Tripled the recipe. Very good. I used ham steaks cut into cubes and put the bones into the soup during cooking.  I found that the salt from the ham and the broth made the recipe not need the full amount of salt per recipe.

Delicious. I used preprepared grated carrot and didn't have celery so used a little extra carrot. I had a can of tomato sauce with basil, oregano and garlic so used that rather than adding herbs. I was trying to use what I had at hand. Despite not following the recipe completely, it was so good. Definitely making this again, so easy.

I needed to use the left over Kirkland ham , and we love lentils.  I used the Instant Pot.   I also used red lentils.  No oregano nor basil (didn't feel like going to snip!);  I substituted some Ketchup for the tomato sauce.  High pressure for 15 minutes; then let steam-release naturally for 15.  This is yummy.

Excellent! I've had trouble getting lentils seasoned in the past so I was a little worried this wold be bland. Not at all! The lentils and veggies did get a little over done and mushy in my opinion so next time I will either reduce the cook time or else just do a quick release instead of the natural release. I'm still giving this 5 stars. This is a great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I did not use my IP but made it over the stove (cooking time was not more than 20 min I would say). The soup was flavorful when it was done. After tasting it, I decided to add a half of lemon. Not just the juice but the actual lemon. That boosted the flavors. But it was a 5 before that as well. We will make it again :)

I made this recipe and it was delicious! Very easy to make, just add all ingredients into slow cooker and cook on high for 5 hours. The family loved it. I paired it with a salad and BraziBites (Brazilian rolls). Will definitely make it again.
