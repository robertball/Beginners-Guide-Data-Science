This is CONEY sauce. Not chili! Ten stars! just upped the ketchup a bit.also try adding dry minced onion instead of fresh. gives it bolder onion flavor.i also reduced vinegar.if you put meat in food processor it makes it more of a classic coney consistency. then to make the flavor really cook together well, i slow cooked in the crock pot.

This recipe was absolutely great!! The only things I modified were I added a little bit more ketchup and a little bit more Worcestershire sauce.(just a little) I am a true chili dog fan and at first, I thought this recipe would not compare to my traditional chili that I make for hot dogs. But now, this is my new recipe!  Thanks Grandpa!

Excellent coney sauce. This not a chili dog recipe. There is a difference between a coney and a chili dog. If you want a chili dog, search for a chili dog recipe. I used one of those hand blenders (boat motors) to get the meat fine after I added the sauce.

My family and my neighbors really enjoyed this recipe. Using one of those hand blenders I followed the suggestion from a previous review. And found that to be so helpful and handy....now I know how Taco Bell's taco meat is always this way. I will totally make this again and now use my hand blender in other uses like this. This gets my 5 star. I didn't change not one thing to this recipe. Everyone had more then one hot dog. Thanks

This was so good that my husband couldn't stop and ate 4 coneys! He said it was a little sweet, but really good. My son thought it was really good but different from the chili type sauce he is used to. Both of them have said they want this again. I thought this was almost like sweet tomatoey sloppy joes.  I did add water to the beef in the skillet before I cooked it so it would break into fine pieces instead of being chunky when it browned. Thanks for posting this Sean, your Grandpa's sauce is a hit!

Love, love, love this recipe! I see by the reviews that many Americans don't know the difference between chili dogs and coney dogs. People this is not a chili dog recipe. No chili powder should ever come near this recipe and it should not taste like you opened a can of that foul chili stuff made by Armour. This is a sweet recipe that covered coney dogs at the root beer drive-in when I was a little girl (45-50 years ago). 

Grandpa you rock! This is the recipe I've been trying to find for the last three decades. I followed the recipe to the letter and tasted it and thought oh no this is disgusting. I went ahead and added the cooked hamburger/onion mixture and plugged the crockpot in on low. To my utter delight what I tasted two hours later was a trip down memory lane. This is the holy grail of coney dog recipes. My family ate every bite of this recipe and clamored for more. I will be making another batch for 4th of July festivities and I will be adding it to all summer holidays. I can't wait to feed it to guests and extended family members who can reach back to the days when coney dogs ruled the drive ins! Thank you so much.

Wonderful sauce for doggies!  I added a wee bit more ketchup and put cooked ground beef and onion in my food processor after browning.....Delightful.  I will make again and again!

Wonderful!! Just like I remember when I was a kid - just the right flavor!!!!! Will make again!!!  Note:  I used ground bison instead of ground beef.  Also - ***** read some of the other reviews.....this really shouldn't be compared to sloppy joe mix - or chili dogs - this is from the 1950's and it is right on the mark!!

We really enjoy this coney sauce. I have nothing to compare it to, as in one sauce is better than the other, we just know that it's good. After making it a couple times now, I can substitute ground turkey without noticing, cut the sugar back just a touch, add in fresh garlic and I use Beau Monde instead of celery seed. If you do use Beau Monde (which is a snazzy name for celery salt and onion powder), remember to either cut back on the salt you add or eliminate it all together. When I make this, I like to double the ingredients so there's enough for me to freeze for a second or even third or fourth meal. Hot dogs are always on sale during the summer, so this is a good make ahead sauce to thaw for a quick dinner.

This was not great to me.  I was very hopeful based on the reviews but my kids didn't care for it and neither did I.  I will not be making this recipe again.  I am not sure if it was the celery seed or the mustard but the flavors didn't mesh well for me.  I agree with other reviewers in that it tasted very similar to sloppy joes but I just didn't care for this recipe.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  Thanks anyway, different strokes for different folks!  :)

Made this tonight for dinner and it was really good.  I didn't have time to let it slow cook but let it simmer on the stove while I steamed some turkey dogs.  Cut the recipe in half and it still came out very good.  Not too dry and not too soupy.  Next time I will slow cook it and use the immersion blender to get it the right consistency.  Really good recipe.

This is a really good chili but not really a chili without chili powder so I added 2 tablespoons of chili powder.  Also would add a little more catsup and worcestershire sauce as my chili seemed to need a little more liquid.  Overall, this was a very good addition to my Saturday night hot dogs!!

Really good, I will definitely make this again. Also if you don't want to get out your mixer or food processor can get the meat fine if you use a potato masher on it as you're cooking it.

Way too sweet.  Followed recipe exactly but during taste testing I found it was not as good as I had hoped.  While it was in slow cooker I added dried onion, garlic and some chili powder.  Still too sweet!!  I added one can undiluted tomato soup and that cut the sweetness nicely.  I simmered in crock pot a bit longer and it was very good

Let me start with .... I am not a huge fan of ground beef but my hubby is.  I made these for the NBA finals game and they were a huge hit.  I did use premium hot dogs (Hebrew National jumbo franks) and home made Honey wheat buns.  These were great.  Hubby will be requesting these again and again.  Yum!

I halved the recipe and would be plenty for 6 dogs. I followed this recipe to a T but needs some tweaking. The sauce is too sweet for my taste. Going forward, I am going to eliminate the sugar all together. Instead of ketchup, I am going to use tomato sauce. It also needs some sort of spice component. Maybe red pepper flakes, chili powder, or paprika. I also added about 1/2 cup water to the meat while browning to get it fine.

I admit, I am a hotdog fanatic.  This recipe has been in my files waaay too long.  I had not separated a 5 lb. package of ground beef and decided to hold onto 2 lbs and not put into the freezer so I could make this recipe last night to go on some grilled hotdogs tonight.  Of course, the aroma made me crazy so I nuked a dawg, added this sauce and fell in love with your Grandpa!!  This is totally TNT CONEY sauce.  Delicious is sooo understated!!

I made this coney sauce per the recipe and I have to say I was kindof dissappointed. I understand that this is not a recipe for hot dog chili, but I still expected it to have some chili-like flavor. The flavor of this sauce was more like sloppy joe filling. This is not a flavor that I normally associate with hot dogs. I think I'm just going to keep looking for a more chili-like recipe.

Fantastic CONEY SAUCE ! Please don't give this recipe a bad review because it isn't chili sauce - read the title first, the word "chili" does not appear in it. Being a kid of the late 50's and 60's, this is absolutely like the Coney Sauce that we loved on the footlongs from our little Mom and Pop diner/drive-in. Make sure you slow cook this for hours either in the crock pot or at low heat on the stove top or tightly coverd in a 250 degree oven. I cut the sugar to a tablespoon and a half since I used honey mustard. Thanks for a trip down Memory Lane!

Pretty good.... Although I generally have more time to cook on weekends, I didn't have the energy for anything but being a couch potato today (it's been a "too long" week). Because this took minimal time to throw together and happily cooked away in my slow cooker, I'm awarding 4 stars. Because I prefer a straight up traditional chili dog (this was a tad too tangy for me / my hubby's liking), I'd personally only award 3. I have never had the "real" thing before, and therefore have nothing to base my comparison on. Having said this, I do think Grandpa's secret recipe reminds me of sloppy joe mix. I'm sure this is 100% authentic, but for those of us who have not had the opportunity to taste the real deal, this is the closest thing to compare to (IMHO). NOTE: You MUST finely grind your beef to acheive a true "coney-style" consistency (thank you Internet!). You can use a food processor, standard blender or hand-held immersiion blender to do this (I used my fp). Just brown your beef / onion, drain and pulse slightly. Another way to get this fine texture is to boil your meat, (I've never tried this method, and therefore can't attest to whether it really works or not...). Served garnished with shredded cheddar and chopped red onion, these weren't bad at all. I'm just not sure they're worth making again. Thanks anyways, Sean! :-)

This was GREAT, it made great CONEYS (which by the way are NOT Chili Dogs)!!!  I followed the recipe except for 2 things.  I used lean ground turkey instead of the beef (since we did NOT use turkey dogs, needed to cut fat somewhere!) and added 2 or 3 shakes of Lousianna Hot sauce too.  Great recipe!

I have made this exact recipe before and it is to die for! I used to work at a drive-in here in Indiana a few years back and this tastes just like their coney sauce! People would pay big bucks to get their sauce premade in a bag to take home and cook. I am a very picky eater and this is the only recipe I will ever use. I will take the suggestion of another reviewer and use my food processor to cut the ground beef finer after it is browned. Thank you so much! This recipe I will hold on to for life. I think my boyfriend will stick around for good too because he LOVES this recipe lol

Really great Coney Sauce. Didn't change anything.  Almost a sweet and sour taste to it. Had some left over so I added it to some baked beans. That was great too. Thanks Sean!

Perfection! As said in other postings, it is NOT meant to be a chili sauce.  Throw some on a steamed natural casing hot dog, top with mustard, ketchup, and onions.

This is tasty but not what i'm looking for. To me the flavor of ketchup , vinegar and sugar is overwhelming. I'm looking for something not so rich, more of a spicy meaty flavor, but don't really have any suggestions to make it. It would be browner in color, not so red, and perhaps much drier. Guess I'm just too use to our local upstate NY hot dog sensation for several years from New Way Lunch or nicknamed, "Dirty John's Hot Dogs " or as the youner generation labeled it, "Dirt Dogs". They are great and people send for these all over the country.Try one if you ever are in our area.

DELICIOUS! I scaled the recipe back to use onlt 3/4 pound of meat b/c that's all I had and that was plenty for us. After cooking/draining the meat and onion mixture, I finely ground it in my food processor. I then proceeded w/ the recipe, only allowing it to simmer on the stove instead of the slow cooker, until I felt it was done. I would like to try it in the slow cooker sometime, I just didn't have time. I think while this did rival sloppy joe to an extent, it was just different enough, and we LOVED it on our hot dogs! NOTE: I actually made this last week when I had to use the meat and froze it until I needed it...worked perfectly!  I will def make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is not at all what I think a coney sauce should taste like.  It is more like a sweet ketchup with beef.  I had to triple the mustard and add chili powder just to more it closer to coney sauce.  Big disappointment for the Super Bowl.

We LOVE this on hot dogs!  After browning my beef, I used my immersion blender to grind it fine.  I used a bit less vinegar and sugar and a bit more catsup than called for (just because it looked like it need more "sauce").  This will definitely be my "go to" for hot dogs!  Thanks!

I halved the recipe because we didn't need so much but it was very good.  We all liked it and will make it again.  I don't know if it tastes like a coney dog (never had one) but it tastes yummy none-the-less!

Good Coney sauce. The celery seed definitely gives a different odd flavor.

Definately too much ketchup though. No need to add salt because the add sauce all have salt in them.

pureed the meat with small amount of chicken soup stock, added chili powder and paprika to taste and small amount of parm cheese and a bay leaf. Cooked 3hrs.

I cannot give this five stars because it doesn't taste like any chili dog I've ever had, it's too sweet and not chili-like.  But we did like it as sloppy joes, it has well-balanced spices.

I'm from the West Coast so I have never had a coney dog before.  My dad always wanted to open a store but never did.  In reading online it seems like it's just supposed to be heaven but I have to be honest, I'm living in Mexico and I really want to open a hot dog restaurant here with a sauce like coney sauce but in reading the reviews it seems like everyone likes this sauce but unfortunately it doesn't do it for me.  I followed the recipe exact by the way.

two words :  absolutely amazing!  My fiance's favorite meal is hot dogs, which to me can get pretty boring but this coney sauce was exactly what I needed to spice things up!  In fact, I never craved a hot dog until I made this.  
Thanks for posting!!

This is good but it is not what we are used to having on our hotdogs.  It is sweet, just so you will know.  I followed the directions exactly and found the ground meat crumbled small enough that I did not think it needed to be emulsified as an earlier reviewer mentioned.  Overall, I think this could be used as a different version of sloppy joes.  There is not a lot of difference to me in sweetness or in texture though I do appreciate GPa sharing this recipe.

I have never had coney sauce so I have nothing to judge theis against. That being said it tasted almost exactly like the sloppy joe recipe that I use. It wasn't bad but a little sweet for a hot dog to me. Even after loading on the mustard it was still quite sweet.

This recipe is better than most I've tried, but I still don't think it's it. I might give it one more try since I let it simmer on the stove rather than all day in the crockpot. Almost, but not quite.

TIP:  If you want the meat to have a very fine texture, boil it in water.  Place the ground beef in a saucepan, cover with water and slow boil until the meat is brown.  You will know when it is done.  Sounds very strange and looks very unappetizing, but this is how you get the right texture.

Maybe it's just that I am a California girl and haven't had a coney dog? To me this just tasted like a sweet sloppy joe on top of a hot dog

I've tried many recipes on this site and never found a bad one until today. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with nothing that resembles Coney Sauce. Sorry, but I would not recommend this recipe.

Now this is a coney island, I have similar recipe. There is only one flavor truly Coney Island, all the others are chili. Only criticism is I've always had them wtih the onions steamed on top and NOT cooked with the meat. American CLASSIC!! Don't put cheese on this work of art.

Have never had a coney before, enjoyed very much. Followed the recipe measurements to a T and put in the crockpot for almost 7 hours (little longer than I intended, but we had a fun day at the zoo!). DBF said they tasted ok too, he grew up eating them in MI...DS was not a fan but he does not really like hot dogs. Crock potting for so long pretty much made the onions disappear and my burger was in pretty fine chunks so it was a nice smooth sauce. I had to add some Dijon to mine because otherwise it's not a hot dog to me. Yum, thanks for the recipe!

I have never had the Coney sauce this is being compared to by reviewers, and I am not a hot dog fan.  1 or two a year has always been more than enough for me.  I saw this recipe a while back and saved it to make for hubby.  I saw the proportions and thought that would be just the right amount for him, and decided I would have leftovers, while he devoured hot dogs and fries.  I put it all together just as the recipe stated, using the immersion  blender in the crockpot,  after adding the drained meat and onions, then the rest of the short list of ingredients, putting it on low,  and walking away.  I went by it and it smelled so good that I just had to taste it.  It is SO good!!  I would eat that on hotdogs once or twice a week.  I would eat it on cheeseburgers.  I would eat it out of a bowl with a spoon!  Hubby loves it too, btw.  I knew he would.  Certainly add hot sauce or chili powder if you want it spicy, but don't be confused, this is nothing like chili, nor does it claim to be!  If it's a sloppy joe or chi dog you want, there are great recipes for both on this site.  This is really very good, and am so glad I tried it! Thanks :)

Awesome.  So, so good.  I grew up in Southeast Michigan and am now living in Tennessee.  Around here, when a place advertises "Coney-dogs", they are usually selling chili dogs, and I've missed my hometown favorites.  This sauce took me home.  We ate coney dogs for a week and I can't wait to make another batch.  The only thing I did different was use a stick blender to smooth out the sauce.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

Thank you for this great recipe! I did cut in half and I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin.  The cumin seem to give it that real "Coney Dog" taste. These were fantastic! I was going to A&W, but decided to make my own. It saved me a lot of money and tastes so much better!  Bye Bye A&W!

This was okay, there was a little too much vinegar in the taste.  My family has been using this recipe for years, except this is our recipe for sloppy joes!  Tasted quite different on a hot dog...but it was okay.

This is exactly what I was looking for! I used cider vinegar instead of white, and kept everything else the same-- except cooked it pretty quick and it was still perfect! Reminds me of the coneys I had growing up. So much better than chili-dog sauce (which is about all there is where I live now).

This is NOT at all what I was expecting! It was way too sweet. It tasted like sweet sloppy joe sauce. I had to make adjustments once done to try and reduce the sweetness. Could be good sloppy joe recipe with some tweaks (less sugar less ketchup)

This is a very good coney dog recipe. I see some people are confusing it with chili dog recipe. I made it exactly to the recipe. And i thought it was very good. I used a leaner ground chuck, I would think I would increase the amount of meat if i used a fattier hamburger. But we all liked it and will make it again !!!!

I've made this a few times. Put raw hamburger in crockpot and add all ingredients. It will come out perfect without using hand mixer or food processor. Same way i make actual chili. Fry 2 lbs and put in 2 pounds raw. Best of both worlds. Thanks Sean for a great tasting recipe

I have nothing to compare this to, but a far off memory of the sauce our high school band boosters used during football games back in Ohio. I loved their sauce and I loved Grandpa's sauce, too.

But let me pile on to what others have said before me. This is a sweet sauce with a little zing. If that sounds "gross" to you, don't make this recipe. This is NOT a chili dog sauce. Looking for a chili taste? Find a chili-based recipe. And don't ever trust one that has ketchup as an ingredient! LOL

I think of this as a fancy high-grade, meat-infused, sweet ketchup hotdog sauce. I, too, made a half batch. Because my slow cooker was too big for 1 lb of meat, I put it in a small covered casserole and baked it for 4-5 hours on 200.

I cut this in half.  This was great...as a sloppy joe recipe IMHO.  :)  I just couldn't add this sauce again on a *hot dog*, even though everyone said it was authentic.  It was just too sweet.  It was even a little too sweet for my taste for a sloppy joe.  I will definitely make it again, just serve on hamburger buns (sorry!), and reduce the amount of sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very tasty! Made according to recipe and it turned out perfect. I used my immersion blender to get it smoother. No, it does NOT taste like chili :)

I worked at a root beer stand in the early 70's and know what a coney dog is....this is an excellent recipe. If you taste the sauce it will taste sweet but it is not meant to be eaten alone, once you put it on a salty hot dog it is excellent. Like others I use a grinder for the beef.

Very Good! Followed the recipe going just a little light on the sugar and vinegar (based on feedback from other reviews) and after browning the meat with the onion I pulsed it through the food processor for a smoother texture. This sauce is great. Brought it to a potluck and everyone loved it. It sorta tastes like a sloppy joe but as another reviewer said somehow just a bit different. Wonderful addition to bring or have at a picnic were hotdogs will be had. Thanks Sean!

The only thing I did different, I increased the Wor. sauce to a full tsp, then doubled it. Then at the end, I thought it needed a little kick, and I had this southwestern chipotle sauce of some sort, so I added a little of that. It was really very good. I dont know that I have had a coney dog before, only chili dogs, and since we were swimming at the redneck beach, I thought it would be a nice touch :-)

Having never had classic coney sauce I thought is was good. The kids liked it and only added a little more mustard to it. It is not a chili but makes a hearty meal. Thanks

Never had anything but chili on top of a hot dog before - this was phenomenal!  I halved the recipe; only changes I made were I didn't have enough ketchup, so I made my own up with a can of tomato paste, some vinegar, water, a little sugar, and some onion powder to taste. It ended up being a little more "ketchup" than the receipe called for.  I also mixed about 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce in, and put in an extra 1/4 tsp of worcerstershire sauce.

well...I was really excited to try this sauce, but so far it just tastes like a sloppy joe. Now, I haven't yet tried it on my dog, so maybe the taste will be different? This just isn't what I was expecting, although I should have known by looking for the amount of ketchup.

I cut the recipe in half and followed ingredients exactly. Simmered in covered cast iron skillet rather than crock pot. This was good, but for my tastes a bit sweet, guess I was looking for more of a chili flavor. So, I added some pepper sauce. If I make again I'll omit sugar and cut back ketchup and add hot sauce or taco sauce.

I did not care for this coney sauce and we couldn't eat it.  It's too sweet and too ketchup-y.   I have never had a coney sauce that tastes sweet.  I guess we're going hungry tonight.

Finally, a coney recipe everyone in the family liked.  I used ground turkey because that is all I had & nobody noticed a difference. I used a bit less sugar. So much better then the stuff you buy in the tube.

I thought I would surprise my hubby with a taste of home. The kids and I loved them. Hubby is from Michigan. He said the real coney dogs arent sweet. So next time I will try to make it without sugar. The good thing about this recipe, is that there will be a next time. Thanks for sharing!!

2 thumbs up!! This is very good. I followed advice of other reviewers and added water to the beef while brownong for a finer texture, and added a little extra worchestichire. I added 1/2 yellow mustard and 1/2 dijon, as I ran out of yellow and ommited the celery seed, as I had none. I also used brown brown sugar just because it seemed like the thing to do and added more onion (1 small onion) as we like a lot of onion. A keeper for sure! Thanks gramps!

This is a great Coney sauce!  My family prefers this slightly sweet sauce to traditional chili.  I didn't have time to use my slow cooker, so I just cooked it on the stove.  I added a little chili powder and some extra water.  I'll definitely use my hand blender to get a better texture next time.  I was looking for the perfect recipe for my son's birthday cookout, and I think I found it!  If you're looking for hot dog chili, try the Heavenly Hotdog Sauce recipe on this site.  If you want Coney sauce, this is the recipe for you!

Tried this recipe and another for hot dogs for the kids after school snack.  The kids did not care for this recipe (they liked the heavenly hot dog sauce).  This sauce was a little bland and dry.  I had to keep adding small amounts of water while it simmered.

Wow, this stuff is awesome!  I've never had a Coney dog before being a California girl.  The zip and tang from the mustard and vinegar, and the touch of sweetness are a nice touch.  You don't get that with a chili dog. I reduced the servings to 3 since I only had 1/2 pound of ground beef after making another recipe.  No slow cooker, so cooked covered on the stove-top for 45 minutes on its lowest setting, stirring every 15 minutes.  Had to add a couple Tbs. of water towards the end and it turned out fantastic.  I will be making this often, and in bigger batches so I can freeze some.  It really tastes great!

I've never had a coney dog so thought I'd try.  OH MY!  It was so good.  I did not put mine in the slow cooker but let it remain on low for about an hour on the stove.  I had read a review that someone had used the food processor to make the meat and onions a little finer and it was great.  I think i will use this as my sloppy joe recipe too.  I only made half a recipe and it is still plenty.

Liked it. Didn't change anything.  I may try it next time with a little less mustard as I'm not a big mustard fan and I thought the mustard taste in this recipe was a little strong for me.  But thought it was still good.

thank goodness I didn't add vinegar, there is more than plenty from the ketchup!  I will add ground vs prepared mustard next time as well.  not the most authentic coney sauce, but then I live in Michigan and know what the real deal tastes like.  this is edible, but far from true coney sauce.  to the unitiated, it might be ok.  a tip from me, add 1/4-1/2 c water per pound of lean ground beef, and double the onion, super fine dice, and definitely add some garlic....not just powder, while cooking the beef.  it makes the beef fall apart to the proper consistency without blenders and the garlic helps to balance all that added vinegar from the prepared mustard and ketchup.  then cook the  out of it.  I agree with another reviewer that there is just something off.  after tasting, I also added some other spices to combat the shock of vinegar. So as not to make it too sweet,  I used 1/2 the called for sugar.  this recipe is an easy cheat, but so off from true coney sauce, never mind not using beef heart,  which is hard for most of us to source.  the search for a real coney sauce continues!!!  nice try grandpa!  I gave 3 vs just 2 stars, because it is easy peasy and made with readily available pantry items, and is passable for the folks who have never had true coney sauce.

The sauce was good, but I would leave out the sugar.  I added more salt and some garlic powder.  I will try running the mixture through the food processor.
I would give it an 8.

I found this recipe several years back on this site. I will tell you, it is the best coney sauce. Period. When we cook out in the summer and have friends over, there is never any left. It gets devoured. Do not change a thing with this recipe. Perfect as is. Reminds me of the old drive in when I was a kid.

I've never had a coney dog but love chili dogs & even tho this was different it was really a great topper. I made a half batch on the stove top then put it into a slow cooker & after cooking on high about an hour I used a hand blender to make it as puréed as possible.  Even tho it looked done I wanted to keep it warm so I set it on low but after an hour of that it dried it out. Next time I'm just going to cook it on the stove top then maybe simmer it for half an hour.

My husband grew up in Michigan. The first stop when visiting was always the local Coney Shop. This recipe nailed it. He absolutely loved them,and so did I. I cut down on the ketchup because it seemed like it would have been too sweet Otherwise, as the recipe is written, deeelicious.

This is really good but I might cut the sugar a bit next time since I used a number one name brand catsup that is much sweeter than other brands. Good flavor and exactly what I have been looking for!  This would be good to freeze and have on hand. :-)

This is an excellent recipe! I have never had a true Coney Island Dog but this recipe is great!  I make enough to make "Sloppy Joes" and use the rest for "Coney Dogs" the next day.

Im from the midwest and this was nothing like the coney sauce I am accustomed too!  This recipe tasted like Manwich on a hotdog which would be great if that's what I wanted.

I only made half a recipe and it was more than enough for 3 people. Once you pulse the meat and onions in a food processor it increases the volume. This recipe was really sweet. I would cut back on the sugar for sure. I was suprised that it wasn't tangier with the vinegar and mustard. I will keep looking for a coney sauce recipe.

Sorry to say I made this recipe and didn't like it all. There was a strange taste I think maybe way too mustard or sugar. My family did not like it. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to.

We are from Texas and thought we might not like this because of some of the comments about the sweetness, but we were very, very pleased with the flavor! It was awesome and so much better than chili on a hot dog because it doesn't make the bun soggy. We liked the flavor better than chili on a dog too. I made the recipe as is, without changing anything. My husband is a self-professed hot dog "aficionado," and he loved this! It was great topped with cheese and some extra onions! Thanks so much!

I was expecting more of a liquidy sauce...is that a coney dog or chili dog, i don't know.  This isn't bad, but reminds me of sloppy joes.  Oh well, at least I now know the meat-in-the-food-processor trick I'll use for several recipes in the future, like spaghetti sauce, sausage gravy, etc.  I'll keep looking for the perfect sauce in the meantime.

I don't know what a coney sauce should taste like, but I'm glad it isn't chili. Kinda tired of chili recently... Personally, I find the sauce a little too sweet, but I'm making it for a potluck. I must warn people that this isn't chili dog though. Will update with responses if I hear any.

Delicious and easy!  Almost tastes like a sloppy joe but jthere is definite difference.  My daughter who won't touch sloppy joes, whether homemade or store bought, really likes it.  

I didn't have plain vinegar on hand so I used apple cider vinegar.  I halved the recipe since I only had one pound of beef and it was perfect for an 8 count serving of hot dogs nicely stuffed.

I made this for my mother-in-law whose sisters and her are '50's Drive-In experts, and they loved it!  They kept comparing it to their fav Drive-Ins' Coney Sauce.  Now they're begging for the recipe! 1st time my bro-in-law complimented my cooking! Thanks for making me a star at my in-laws gathering!  Great sauce!!!

Outstanding. I went to get the bowl to bring home what was left and it was scraped clean from todays family outing. The family thought these 80's folks had all the answers. As someone suggested I did add (2) tablespoons of water to the hamburger to help break up the lumps. It worked perfectly. You can't beat the 'old folks'.

This is the best coney sauce ever! Made it by the recipe, only cut it in half. This WILL be my "go to" hot dog sauce from now on.

I always assumed that a Coney Island Hot Dog was just another name for a Chili Dog....until I read this recipe!  I think I like these BETTER than Chili Dogs!  I halved the recipe and cooked it only about a half hour, but I will definitely plan on making it again in the slow cooker.

I wasn't too sure about this but it turned out FANTASTIC!!  Everyone loved it (we had a cookout with the neighbors).  The only change I made brought the ketchup up to about 1 3/4 cups because as 1 1/2 cups the sauce was a bit "mustardy" for my family.

I made this last night and I  have to say-it's delicious. It's sweet but has a nice tang to it. Very easy to make. I put it in my little slow cooker-added about 1/4 cup of water and just let it go for about 4 hours-it was awesome. Your grandfather did a great job with this sauce. Thanks Sean for sharing this.

This was pretty good & I did use it as a sloppy joe sauce also.  It just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

Great recipe!  I had never made coney sauce before and i'm glad that I picked this recipe for my first try.  So easy to make and I loved being able to throw everything in my crockpot to simmer.  The sauce was great on my hotdogs!  In fact, I could have just eaten the sauce by itself!

Oh my so delicious!  I live in Northern NJ and we have what we just call "sauce"  so you order a hot dog with sauce and I have always wanted to duplicate it and this is it.  I made it ahead on a Sunday to have with hogs as a quick dinner on a work night. I kept "tasting"it, it was so yummy we are lucky we have it left for dinner

I have to say that this is the best yet! I tried this for a cookout and it went like crazy. I have fixed it a number of times since. Now I keep it fixed ahead by deviding into containers and freezing it for those last minute meals and when company drops in.   Rick

Extraordinary Coney Sauce!   I did not change a thing and it was perfect.  When I was a kid in the 60’s, my dad would take me out of town to an old drive-in Pleasanton, KS and we would always have the best Foot-Long Coney Dogs ever made.  This Coney Sauce reminds me a lot of those delicious Foot-Long Coney Dogs.    I invited my friend (who didn’t even know what a Coney Dog was) over to have just Coney Dogs for dinner and (like me) he thought that they were fantastic.  I will certainly treasure this recipe for years to come.  Thanks Sean for sharing your this recipe with us.

Amazing sauce. I took the advice of another reviewer and ran the meat through the food processor after browning then returned to the pan and sauced it up. Thanks Grandpa!

This was so wonderful and hit the spot.  I made the recipe as stated, except that I added about 2 T of French's chili seasoning and I used a hand-blender to make the meat the size it should have been for a coney sauce.  I didn't have any complaints except that the flavor was a little faint to me - I wanted something that has a small pop.  When I make this again, I'm going to add some extra chili seasoning.  Used it for days and, like others have said, it was better the next day, and the next.

This sauce is great!!!!  I loved it and so did my family.  I'm going to use it to take to my family reunion this year where I'm sure it will be a hit.  I did take the advice of others and add extra ketchup.  This will be my hot dog sauce from now on!

Very tasty.  Not at all spicy or hot.  Not greasy, so it makes for a clean meal.  In all my years of cooking, I have never mixed these amounts of catsup and mustard in a sauce, and I was happily surprised with the yummy results.

I have never had a true "coney" dog. Not sure how it is to taste, but For me this recipe was how my mom always made sloppy joes, and is perfect for sloppy joes therefore I could not enjoy the sauce on a hotdog. It got 4 stars for the recipe was very yummy but not for what recipe intended.

This is so much better than a chili dog; so much lighter......we loved this recipe.....will be a family favorite from now on.  I encourage all to try this recipe, but make sure to use your immulsifier to blend it all up and make it nice and fine...wouldn't be the same if it was left chunky.  Delicioso!!!!!

My husband and I both really loved this recipe.  I didn't have any celery seed so I crushed up some dried celery flakes instead. I also added just a little more ketchup to it. It smelled delicious when it was simmering in my crockpot and my husband could hardly wait for dinner.  We spooned a little heated chedder cheese (jar of Ragu) on our dogs before adding on the Coney sauce because we love cheese.  I have enough leftover for another meal so I will freeze for future use.  Yummy sauce, Grandpa...thank you for posting the recipe!

This is pretty good.  I made it a little backwards though.  First I added all of the ingredients but the onion and hamburger to a pot and brought them to a simmer, then I added the raw hamburger and onions, this easily makes the hamburger break up in to that fine texture.  I continued simmering for about 15 minutes and then transferred it to a crockpot for about 4 hours.

This is pretty good...tastes similar to our sloppy joe recipe but a bit more tangy.  I might use a little less vinegar and mustard next time, but still good.  I added another 1/2 cup ketchup and added about 1/4 tsp. allspice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

As someone else said, more like sloppy joe mix than chili dog topping.  Not crazy about it.
Update 2/24/10---Cut it down by 1/4 and made on stovetop to go on hotdogs.  Used old fashioned potato masher as meat was browning to get a really fine texture and it was yummy!

I have been looking for a coney sauce recipe for many years since I moved away from my local coney island. Ever so often I make a recipe from the internet. This was the worst one so far.  Sorry but this taste nothing like any coney I have eaten. I only ate one and threw the rest away.

The consistency was good,  but Too sweet!  Tastes like sloppy joe, not coney sauce.

It was pretty good but tasted like a sloppy Joe.  Sweeter than any hot dog sauce I have ever had. Will try w/o sugar next time.

Boyfried liked it said I need to tweak it a little. Thought is was sweet and tasted more like Sloppy Joe's. Tried adding extra spices: chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic, red pepper. 
Will try again, I did not have vinegar had to use Apple Cider which only made it sweeter.

Yummm, it's my go to for Coney dogs. Here is my tip: if you add a cup of water to the meat at the beginning there is no need to blend it with any kind of mixer. Cook till water is all gone.  Works on taco meat also. Hate Worcestershire y but bought it and added to make it like his.

Recipe is delicious as is! My boyfriend said it was the best hotdog he’s had, and he would eat it by itself on a bun. I did use my immersion blender to make the meat more fine.

I made Grandpa’s Classic Coney Sauce. I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband liked it, I thought it was ok. I found it a little too sweet & like some other reviewers, it tasted similar some homemade sloppy Joe recipes I have made in the past. Next time when making it I’ll use less sugar as ketchup adds enough sweetness.

My wife made it.  She is an excellent cook by reputation and used just one tablespoon of sugar.  It was off the chart good.  Per one of the other reviews put the hamburger in the food processor after you fry it and grind it up.  Wow! Can’t say enough good things about this recipe.  Don’t forget to use a high end hot dog.

I will cut way back on the sugar next time.  Just a bit too sweet for us.  Very, very good.  Took me back to the late 60's, early 70's.  I've found over the years after working in coney stands and my families restaurant when I was young that if you cook the ground beef in water, just a few cups, it is really easy to get it into small pieces without a blender or food processer.  Also reduced the fat content.  Once the beef is no longer red and just a light pink, drain it and put it back on the stove for a little bit to make sure all the moisture is out.  Continue the recipe as directed.  You can also put the onoins in with the ground beef.

Seems just like the James Coney island sauce, I did use a food chopper to finely chop the onion and the same to finely grind the meat once cooked.
Flavor was great and did not need to change anything.

I didn't even need to make this recipe to know how good it is. This is virtually identical to my late mother's sloppy joe recipe. If you leave out the sugar and vinegar, cook it in a saucepan on the stovetop and serve it on toasted hamburger rolls, voile!

Try this, 1 can of Wolf chili no beans with 1 small onion chopped fine and sauteed until soft, don't burn. Add a little water if it gets to thick. Mix it together and serve, I freeze the leftover in an icecube tray. YOU WILL BE AMAZED TheReaper!

I used tomato paste in lieu of ketchup, halved the sugar, halved the celery seed, halved the salt, added couple dash’s of garlic powder and a tsp it so of chili powder. Added some water and simmered. It was perfection and WILL make again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Most coney sauces have a more chili like taste but this was decidedly more tangy and savory. I’d almost compare it to a BBQ sauce but it’s definitely not lol. I’ve made it 3 times now. I did it once in the slow cooker and it just wasn’t quite the same for me. Pro tip ignore all the people saying this isn’t chili they just want to make themselves sound important. You saw the name of the recipe we know what it is.

Very good sauce. I thought it tasted a little bit vinegary but not enough to hurt the recipe. My wife absolutely loved it and I will make it again.

I make this every summer for barbecues. It is a huge hit even for those who don’t like hot dogs (such as myself). And it’s a bit of history. I like that.

Yummy! Other than omitting the onions, I followed the recipe. Great on hot dogs, tots, etc. Also good on top of crackers and cheese.

I thought this sauce was great! I excluded the onion (not a fan). Overall it was very sweet, I might exclude the sugar next time since the ketchup is sugary enough.

Best I ever tasted.  Followed the recipe exactly except for the cooking instructions since  I made it the night before I was planning on serving it- while I was making dinner. Busy week!
 I let it sit on low on the cooktop for 45 minutes or so after all the ingredients were added. I didn’t feel the crockpot was necessary once it cooked a while since the flavors melded nicely. TIP:   If you do use the cooktop, keep an eye on it and stir often since it’s not soupy.  I used my Bullet blender to break up the beef working in small batches.  Perfect texture and super quick!

Made it as per the recipe first time for a cook-out for our church men's group.  Also had BBQ pulled chicken.  Guess what?  The guys devoured the hot dogs with the Coney sauce.  Now I make up reasons to host cook-outs to make this recipe again!

I found this to be the most authentic Coney recipe I've come across. That being said, I did sub out the ketchup for Heinz chili sauce... It's a family thing. I also went to the trouble of putting the ground beef and onion mixture through the food processor after I sauteed it, just for that extra fine grind that I personally equate with Coney sauce. Great recipe, I'll definitely make it again!

Made this for lunch. Halfed the recipe. Way to sweet for me, and I love dogs and sauce. Cut it with water, chilli powder, carlic powder. Still a little to sweet. Would cut the vinegar and the mustard. Prefer sauce from Western West Virginia and Kentucky

Agreed with the reviews that say to put the browned beef in a food processor or to use a hand immersion blender. Otherwise sauce would be too chunky for Coney. Great flavor though! Definitely try it out.

Pretty darn good. Easy to make, I use frozen ground beef, add water & "steam" cook the ground beef breaking up the beef with a potatoe masher. I can get the cooked ground beef to that smooshed up consistency. Tranfer to a slow cooker, add the rest of the ingrediants. It is a tad sweet, but if you think of it as a condiment, it's perfect. IT IS NOT anything like a chili but by the time you add raw onions, relish, mustard, whatever your favorite add ons to the hot dog- delicious! Will make again, a little less sweet for my personal taste.

I would rate this ten stars if I could. I was always under the impression that a coney was a chili dog. How wrong I was!! I cooked the recipe as is with the exception of only using one pound of meat (turkey). Everything else original. The whole time I was preparing, I kept thinking it would be nothing spectacular. Well one and a half hours out I tasted it.  This without a doubt is one of the best things I ever put in my mouth. I would eat it on a flip-flop if I had to. Where has this been all my life. My, my I will have to eat this every night to catch up for all the years I missed. Two and half hours out it was better. Thank you and Grandpa!!!!

This was pretty good! I used ground pork instead of beef by accident and it turned out pretty tasty nonetheless. My picky nephew even liked this recipe (he ate it on the side though, not on an actual hot-dog!). One downside is that this makes for a heavy Hot-Dog Michigan (what we call a chili dog here in Quebec) and, when I ate two, I found myself having massive indigestion (it was fine the next time when I only ate 1). Also, this makes for a pretty sweet sauce, which is ok, but I prefer a somewhat more savory sauce for my Michigan (think more along the lines of a meat sauce). All in all, I would make this again, but when I'm hosting people and not for an everyday meal.

I made this with 1 t chili powder. It was a little too sweet on hot dogs, but the next day I put it on cornbread with sliced hot dogs and it was great. I will reduce the sugar by half next time. Thanks for the recipe!

A good coney sauce that isn't overpowered by spices like most  'chili' sauces.  Was a little sweet so I'll cut down on the sugar next time.  This will be my go to coney sauce.

Haven’t had this before. Was delicious! Don’t try to go chili dog just stay as is. I’ve always liked both mustard and ketchup on dogs and this takes that to a much better place.

Never had a coney dog before. It does taste a little like sloppy joe sauce. I only used a pinch of sugar and a little extra ketchup and I liked it.

This really turned out well as it was written. A great way to elevate the basic hamburger meat, catsup, and chili powder hot dog chili I've been making forever. It actually freezes well. I doubled the ingredients and froze what I did not use.

Excellent recipe. I used Organic Ketchup that had organic sugar,  so I did not add any additional sugar. I did not have celery seed. I will make it again and see if the celery makes a difference in the flavor. Our family really enjoyed it as well.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for ages, it tastes just like the "chilli" on the chilli chips at one of my favorite burger stands.  We no longer live in the area so I have been trying to find a duplicate to make at home and have not been very lucky until I came upon this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent!  I wish I would have doubled the recipe though because I didn't realize what a hit this would be.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Grandpa!

I added a half-cup.of water when  browning the beef to help.break it down . You want fine crumbles not chunks for Coney dogs.

I wish I knew where your grandpa’s drive-in was located. We had one in our town in WNY. The recipe I have is close to our “Chet’s”...for you to compare. There’s nothing better  than good Coney sauce. 
1-# ground round
1/2 Cup finely chopped onion
4 Tabl finely chopped fine celery
2-8oz tomato cans sauce
4 Tabl brown sugar
2Tabl lemon juice
4-1/2 tsp Worcestershire-sauce
1-1/2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp prepared mustard
1/2 Tsp salt
Brown meat and drain well. Add remaining ingredients to meat and mix well. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20-25 minutes or until sauce is thickened, stirring occasionally. 

I think the difference is the brown sugar and lemon juice...the tomato sauce allows the flavors of your own spices without adding the ketchup flavor...which makes the flavor different with what brand ketchup you use. 

All in all my suggestion make the recipe as written and then compare to your own. Your grandpa must have sold a lot of dogs. ??

Thought this was very good tho I didn;t have celery seed and used a bit less sugar. Reminded me of the good old days. For those who had to add chili powder, this is NOT chili.

We like it.  However, it still didn't taste like the coney sauce I had in Michigan.  I made it in my cast iron skillet and made only half the amount.  I did not add the sugar, and next time I will only simmer it for an hour.  Will definitely make it again.

OMG this took me right back to my childhood. It was that same taste of  theTexas Weiner sauce.
I did what others said and added a little more ketchup but that was it.
Thanks Grandpa

No offense. This was terrible as a hot dog chili sauce. Maybe not bad as a sloppy joe. WAY too sweet and ZERO heat. Really disappoints.

Will definitely make this again. Followed the recipe, just added slightly more ketchup because the mustard was a little over powering. Used a potato masher to break up the pieces instead of the food processor.  Using leftovers for sloppy joes.

I am from Michigan and know Coney dogs. Recently moved to Ohio where there are no Coney islands so I figured I'd surprise my fiance with this for dinner. Not even close to a Coney I'm use too. This is more of a Sloppy Joe. It's good. Just not Coney worthy.

I'm sure this coney sauce would be good without the sugar.  I just figured that it was some type of culinary trick.  I thought maybe they know something about sugar that I don't, but nope.  The fact remains that when you add sugar to anything, it just makes it sweet.  You may as well just take a regular coney dog and sprinkle sugar on it,  but who does that?

Vegan Version:  
I turned this recipe vegan by substituting Trader Joe's Beefless Ground Beef for the ground beef.  

Worchestershire sauce is not vegan, so I used a homemade version.  Martha Stewart has an easy recipe for vegan worchestershire sauce:  http://www.marthastewart.com/258132/homemade-vegan-worcestershire-sauce
You can purchase Annie's Naturals Organic Worchestershire or Edwards & Sons Organic Vegan Worchestershire.

I love this sauce! It is great as written, but I do make a few changes. I crumble my ground beef in boiling water for a different consistency. (1 quart water per pound of beef) I then drain it and add all other ingredients except sugar. I cook it on the stove which can make it dry, so I add beef broth.

I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting it in half.  It tastes like sloppy joe meat.  After taste testing, I added some red pepper flakes and a tablespoon of chili powder which made it taste more like coney sauce.  Next time I'll cut down on some of the sugar as I think it's a little too sweet.  I used an immersion blender to smooth out the consistency and put it in my small slow cooker until needed.

We enjoyed this.  Wasn't crazy good, but worth making.   Probably not a regular, but will keep in my folder of items to remake.

Super good! It's a coney sauce, not a chili sauce, but I wanted a bit of the chili flavor,  so I added a few tablespoons of chili powder. Other than that   made exactly as is! Next time I will cut back on the sugar, it was a tad too sweet.  Perfect othet than that!

I've  been searching for a certain recipe that was like one of my favorite places in Indianapolis. I've tried many. This one is spot on! I didn't change a thing.  always try recipes, as written, at first. This is exactly what I was looking for. I make this about three times a year. We just top it with mustard and chopped onion!

Made this recipe for a cookout.  Our condo building was giving a demonstration about our new gas grill so hot dogs were served to attendees.  This sauce was a hit on the hotdogs.   I made the recipe as listed.  Thanks for sharing.  I will definitely make it again.

I think this was very tasty! The only thing I changed was I added some minced garlic and dried onions and ommitted the celery seeds, because I didn't have any celery seeds in handy. The ketchup brand makes a big difference too. For those who said it was too sweet, maybe it was the ketchup. I use Heinz brand ketchup. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is just not the kind of true coney sauce I grew up with. I think I might be able to use this recipe to craft something more like that so I'll try again tweaking the recipe a bit.

This was simple, but you really cannot skip the step where you blend the meat.  Blended, it is the perfect consistency for delicious coney dogs.  It reminded me of my childhood - getting these dogs with my dad.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the real deal, scaled back to 1 pound of beef for 1/2  recipe,people were eating it  strait! Thanks for sharing, slightly modified based on other reviews, for 1/2 recipe used 2 TBS sugar, and cider instead of white vinegar.

I did not grow up where this was popular. I made it for a pot luck at work. There are several coworkers that are from New York and New England. They LOVED it.  It is much like the sloppy joes I make for my family. I made the exact recipe. Rave reviews. My best friend says this is the same recipe her mother made growing up. A crowd pleaser.

Made this for the family, very good.  I do agree with some of the reviews about being a bit on the sweet side but it was enjoyed by all. will be making this again with some minor tweaks to personal taste, consistency was perfect. some are saying they are using food processors or mini blenders to break up the meat, just brown the meat with some water and no need to blend it.

This is my third time. It is a great recipe. I tweaked it with a couple pinches of ground cayenne pepper...just enough to peak the flavor, but not make it the least bit hot. I also added 1/2 ground cumin...perhaps a personal flavor prejudice. I added a little tomato sauce near the end to obtain the desired consistency. I use either Kowalski Stadium Kielbasa or Park's Finest Signature Seasoned franks. Regular hot dogs are not worthy of this fine sauces. Toppings are finely minced sweet onions, mustard, and sharp cheddar for the  coney dog infidels...lol.

Yum! Delicious crowd pleaser! I made the exact recipe for serving size of 12. It tasted even better the next day as a dip for nachos. So easy to make and love that you can serve in a slow cooker for parties.

Just made this at the Fire House. We were worried that it was a bit heavy on the mustard. We stuck the the recipe though and it turned out amazing.  Due to time, we simmered the mix for an hour then added it to the meat (put the onions in the meat to start).  This was a huge hit!

I am so glad i found this recipe. We go every year to a coney place by our house when it opens in the spring. But this year the coneys were not as tasty as years past. I found this recipe and now everyone was happy. I did add a little more Worcester to mine.

Too much vinegar to my taste.  If I make again, I'll cut that in half, and then use the stick blender as others suggested.

Honestly, I liked it more than my BF did. I gave it a 5 stars, he gave a 3, so I gave it an overall 4. I thought it tasted good, but different.

This recipe is bombdiggity!  Love love LOVE it.  It isn't supposed to be a chili sauce, but a coney sauce.  I don't eat bread, but I make this and pour it over hot dogs, top with cheese and onions. sometimes even some sweet relish and extra mustard.  Truly love this recipe and make it at least once a month.  Makes a great heat and eat lunch for workdays.

I made a half recipe (wanted to be conservative just in case) of this yesterday and loved it.  Just like the root beer stands. A half recipe was enough for two people and enough leftover for one more meal. Enjoy !

Loved this.  If you state this is too sweet and you'll never make it again, you are not a good cook.  Yes, it was sweet, so, next time add less sugar.  It was easy to make and my husband said "this tastes and smells JUST LIKE CONEY SAUCE". This isn't canned Vietta Hot Dog Sauce...this is CONEY SAUCE.  I did not use the crock, but simmered it on the stove.  We loved it and will be using it often

I made this recipe to a T and it was a little too tart for me so I added just a touch more ketchup and sugar. after those small touches it came out great. I didn't have the time for the crock pot so I made it on the stove and simmered for about 45 minutes and it came out great. this will my my go to recipe from now on.

Very good coney sauce. I added a bit more ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. I also used onion powder and celery salt instead of fresh onion and celery seed. Definitely recommend this recipe.

Detroit was my home during the 90's and I loved living there.  Politics aside, the coneys from that area are awesome.  As did some of the other reviewers, I felt this was just a tad sweet for me.  But something about it conjured up Motown memories, and also made me reflect on the family picnics we used to have when I was a lad, when Ma would make a pot of sloppy joes.  This recipe reminds me of that.  I served this up today on some Hebrew National all beef weenies.  It complimented them very well.  I topped them off with some good ole Wisconsin cheddar from the heart of the Badger state.

With a few tweeks I could give it 5 stars. It was a little too sweet. I changed the servings to 6. And, to satisfy kids, I opted out of the onions. Here are my changes: Cut the sugar in 1/2, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp celery salt, no table salt added, and chopped fine with my Ninja. With these changes, it was awesome! It reminds me of the hot dog chili from the Bantam Chef in Walhalla, SC.

WOW!!! I love this Coney sauce. I made it yesterday for dinner I did do a few things different first I didn't have time to put it in a slow cooker and let it simmer for a few hours so I just left it in the pan and let it simmer for like 45 mins. ( I really wish it would have gotten to simmer longer in a slow cooker I know it would have tasted even better that way). Second I added more ketchup and I also added some garlic powder. I will make this from now on instead of buying the can of hot dog sauce from the stores. The only thing I plan to do different next time is grind the hamburger up finer.

I have never had coney sauce but this was absolutely amazing.  So different (and lighter) than a chili dog; extremely flavourful.  Me and my family like to boil the hotdogs then add this sauce.  2 hours in a slow cooker is key, it really brings out all those flavors!

We loved it!  In fact it's made us want to have Coney Dogs much more often.  I followed the recipe with only a couple of minor changes - I used ground buffalo instead of ground beef and apple cider vinegar (didn't have white).  Thanks to Sean and his grandfather!

Good stuff, I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar the second time I made it and I liked it both ways. Thanks....

I halved this recipe and it came out superb!  I didn't have time to put the sauce in the crock pot, so I just simmered it on the stove for about half an hour (stirring frequently).  I will never buy ready made sauce again!

I've only had coney sauce once before.  The smokey flavor (from the worchesteshire sauce) was unexpected to me.  It made the sauce taste like a mild BBQ sauce with meat.

This isn't the way I remember Coney sauce, but I'm originally from Illinois, so what do I know? The Coney sauce I used to have was savory, and I agree with others that it's very sweet. It reminded me of sloppy joes. Regardless, I'm sure it will still be good on the smoked frankfurters we have.

Decent flavor. Hubby described as taco meat on a hotdog. However, I wouldn't call it "sauce" It's very dry.

Having never had Coney Sauce, I wasn't sure what to expect, but hubby said it tasted just like it was supposed to. He ate 3 dogs! I enjoyed it too, but it stuck really bad to the bottom of the pot, which is why I'm only giving this 4 stars. Everyone: make sure you stir this every few minutes, or you'll end up with a mess!! Still it was a great meal. Thanks for sharing.

This was exactly what I was looking for!!! As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not chili. I omitted the sugar, used cider vinegar, and cut the mustard down to 1 Tbsp for personal preference. It doesn't look like you will have enough sauce when you first add everything to the meat, but after it cooks for a few minutes it's perfect. It's a tangy, slightly sweet, great sauce to spice up your hot dogs!

This was pretty tasty, just not exactly like any coney sauce I have tried before.  It was a little sweet.  If I make this again, I will invest in a small hand held chopper to get the meat ground up to the correct coney consistency!

This was very good.  I didn't have enough ketchup, so I added a little chili sauce.  I will definitely be making this again!

Not quite the outcome I was hoping for but5 still a good coney recipe.  I thought the mustard flavor was a bit too bold so I will cut that in half the next time I make it.  Thanks for sharing!
