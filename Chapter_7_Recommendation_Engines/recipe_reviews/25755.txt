This is the best chili I have ever had.  The only change I made was to use half ground beef and half finely diced stew beef in the recipe.  The cocoa and brown sugar gave it a very daring flavor, which everyone loved.  I served it with Rhonda's Spoonbread recipe, also found on this site.  Thanks so much for a winner of a meal, allrecipes!!

This was great! I made it in the slow cooker as suggested at the bottom of the recipe.

I think I will season the beef while browning it next time. I'll probably use garlic powder, chili powder, and cumin.

This is a keeper!

Good recipe.  Very hardy. Reminds me a lot of a hardy Wendy's chili.  My husband thinks it is more like Waffle House's chili.  Anyway, it is a good dish.  Makes plenty.

We loved this chili!  I was a little hesitant about using cocoa, but I thought it added a nice depth without any weird flavor, which I was afraid of.  This was just a great simple, rich chili.  Definitely a keeper!  Of course I tweaked it a bit...added a few banana pepper rings, used ro-tel with peppers instead of regular diced tomatoes, some minced garlic, and white sugar instead of brown.  Yummy!

This chili has a great flavor!  It was really EASY to make!!  I let it cook in the Crock-Pot for about 5 hours on a Friday night.  Then, we ate it periodically throughout the weekend, until it was gone! It is a good, basic recipe for chili that you can get creative with after you try it, once.  Like a cook below suggested, I substituted one can of Rotel for one can of the tomatoes.  I served it with cheddar/green chili corn bread.  My boyfriend Loved it!  I will definately make it again.

My kids and I loved this recipe, although when I told them it had cocoa powder
in it, they thought that was gross.  They must have really liked it because they
only left me one serving out of the entire batch!

I thought this chili was good but nothing out of the ordinary, but my husband really liked it so I'll definitely make it again, since it is really easy.  I think I'll leave out or reduce the sugar, though.  Also, I simmered the chili for over an hour; it seemed to need that long to bring the juices out of the vegetables and tomatoes. Next time I might try using the beans undrained so there'll be more liquid.

it was good but not like traditional chili because it had more vegetables in it.  If I had never had chili before & had no expectations of what chili should be like I'd give it 5 *'s.

This is a very good recipe for chili, and can be played with a lot to suit individual tastes, or use what's at hand. I added 1 celery stalk and 1 carrot, both diced; regular diced tomatoes with some chopped jalepenos; and garlic powder because I forgot to mince some and ran out of time. Plus I cooked some dried pinto beans and used that instead of canned. It was awesome.

We LOVED this chili recipe! Everyone had seconds! I used a red bell pepper instead of green and used 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of two. I was suprised how good it was and there were no leftovers! Though the ingredients sound simple, they create a super chili! A keeper! I'll make this one AGAIN!

This is a keeper! I used veggie "beef" crumbles in place of the ground beef, and since there's no need to pre-cook them, I just threw them in frozen from the bag with everything else. I also just used whatever canned tomatoes I had on hand. I was out of chili powder so used 1 tsp cayenne pepper instead (it's much more potent) and tossed in a couple of bay leaves. everything cooked in my slow cooker for about 5Â½ hours and turned out DELICIOUS. (hint: cooking vegetarian crumbles in a slow cooker makes them taste much "meatier") So easy, I will be making this again!

This is a great recipe! I was worried it was going to be too sweet but it actually had a great kick to it!  My husband loved it!  I made it in the crock pot and cooked it on high for three hours because I was short on time.  It came out perfect! I'll make this again for sure.

I thought this recipe was great, not too sweet like I noticed some said.  I admit I was skeptic on the chocolate cocoa powder, don't know what it did but it was great.  I served it to 3 other people family & neighbor and they all thought it was great.  It's a keeper.

Very good basic recipe, needs some tweaks based on personal preferences.  I add a half of a can of Yuengling (amber beer), a bit more liquid (beef broth), a 1/2 teaspoon of worchestershire sauce, and a 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle powder and 5 drops frank's red hot sauce just to kick it up some

This was the first time I made chili myself and I really liked it. I added another can of kidney beans because I like less meat.  I also used fresh tomatoes and added water which I like much better than canned tomatoes.  I'll definately use this recipe again. Thanx!

I made this as a way to get out of going to the grocery store since I already had all the ingredients. It was good and I received a couple compliments on how tasty it was. Personally, I felt it was missing something. But I'm not sure what. It did remind me of Wendy's chili as another reviewer said. I like lots of beans and ground beef in my chili and this recipe did have that. Next time I will double the recipe since I only got 5 bowls out of it.

I made this chili in the crockpot.  My husband and I both thought it was delicious, although he said it was just a little too sweet for his tastes.  I think the brown sugar could be reduced in that case.  I really enjoyed the flavor of it and would make it again!

I made this recipe in the slow cooker, after browning the meat in a skillet. It was very simple to prepare that way. The seasonings were really good, no single flavor overpowering the rest. I think the brown sugar that gives it a barbecue flavor. I rarely make meat chili, but this one is a keeper.

A++++ !  Fixed this recipe after work, was easy.  Almost like a stew. 
Wonderful flavors, husband had 2 huge bowls over macaroni.  Next time I'm going
to try it in the crock pot. Was a little uncertain about the cocoa (I even used 
regular Hershey's cocoa) but it added a great touch.  Was not sweet, just delicious!
Was sad I didn't have enough left-overs for tonight!

I thoroughly enjoyed this chili!  I used venison instead of beef, red pepper instead of green, 4-10 oz cans of Rotel tomatoes w/chiles.  I also added about 3-4 TBS of cornstarch as a thickening agent.  (I like a thicker chili, but am gluten free).  The spice was great!  The sweetness is not overpowering, but lent a nice flavor.  Days later... it's gaining flavor!

I tried this recipe as written in the crock pot.  The flavor was very good, but it came out a little thinner than I like so traded one can of diced tomatoes for a can of tomato sauce and one diced serrano pepper, and cooked it on the stove top.  It was perfect.  It has a really nice rich almost barbeque flavor followed by a long slow burn.

WOW! This is the BEST spicy chili I've EVER had! I highly recommend this. I did add a tomato paste/water mixture (because I didn't have any tomato juice) to add more broth.

Very easy to make, a little too spicy for our family.  Also, I suggest cutting back on the sugar as it has a "sweet" taste. I miss not having pasta (elbow macaroni) in it. (I think that's a Wisconsin tradition adding noodles to chili).  Might make again...but will add pasta next time.

This recipe is so hearty.. The cocoa makes the difference. We are not huge cumin fans so I halve that  and I usually use pink, red and white beans. My family loves this on a cool fall day. Adding some cheddar cheese as a topping when serving makes it a true "comfort food".

Yummy!  After I mixed everything together it didn't look soup-y or even stew-y enough, but I cooked it in my crock pot and it turned out great!  Served it with a dollop of sour cream to top off the bowl, and also made the Camp Cornbread recipe from this website, served with butter and honey.

This chili is amazing!  My only change is to add 3 heaping Tbs. of chili powder instead of two.  Overall, everyone I make it for loves it!

Perfect chili recipe!  This is the one I will use from now on.  Since I had some cilantro on hand, as well as some leftover pork tenderloin, I added that (and reduced the ground beef to 8 ounces).  I cooked it in my slow cooker on low for about 5-1/2 hours, and my husband and I both loved it!

I liked this! I didn't notice any sweetness, having used unsweetened cocoa powder. My fiance wants it a bit "soupier" but I like it nice and thick like this stew was. I would prefer it a bit oilier, but toher than that it was very good.

Great recipe! The only change was that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also made Baked Corn 1 (also from this site) as a side dish.

I like this recipe because it was really easy and quick to make. I used more sugar and more chili powder because it tasted a little on the bland side, or too much like tomatoes, but dont cut back on the tomatoes because thats where the liquid comes from.I have tried to make chili twice before and it never turned out good and also took too long, but this one was a sucess, so I gave it five stars, because even a non cook like me can get it right.

This turned out amazing!  I had to make some alterations since I live in Norway.  I used "S&W Mexican Recipe stewed tomatoes w/ chili and seasonings".  I used 500g of ground beef. A red pepper instead of a green.  I increased it to 3 Tbls brown sugar.  And I used 1 tsp of All Spice because I didn't have any cumin.  It had a great smoky flavor.  The cocoa mixed with the spices creates a mole flavor, which I think reminds some people of bbq, but is typical of some Mexican cuisine.  The result is a sweet and spicy chili which you won't regret.

We loved this chili - I will make it from now on instead of my own recipe. I did double the beans though.

I make this all the time. It's so easy, and it tastes SO good. Even my husband loves it, and he's the pickiest eater I've ever met.
