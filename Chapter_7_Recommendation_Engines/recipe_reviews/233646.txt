I made this with no changes or adjustments and it turned out wonderfully! It was very flavorful and tender. Will definitely make this again.

So good!  Instead of frying the chops before baking, I broiled them for 2 minutes on each side (I sprayed them with olive oil to get some crunch) then baked as recipe directed. I'd make this again and again

Great dish and my kids loved it! I had to substitute with soy milk, and used crushed cornflakes instead of the italian-style breadcrumbs. Came out delicious! Will try the breadcrumbs next time, and adding this to our favorite family meals!

This is a great base recipe. My changes were...a lot more garlic and onion. Also seasoned chops with basil, oregano and rosemary and let them just sit and soak  up all those great spices. They turned out awesome !! Very moist and flavorful. My boyfriend loved it and so did my picky nephew that never eats any real food. Also made garlic sautéed green beans  and baked potato. Yum  will definitely make again.

Great pork chops. Everyone loved them. Don't need to change a thing. Just watch them while they fry because 2-3 minutes was plenty. I used pork loin chops.

Don't like to use canned soups, so made a rou with chicken broth and butter in the pan where I sauteed the pork chops.  Served over spaghetti with a ratatouille.  My housemate, who asked for pork chops a couple of days ago, kept saying "Make sure they aren't dry".  She was so happy and said they were perfect.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this was a great pork chop recipe. I notoriously have a hard time getting my pork chops to come out tender and not tough and dry. This recipe did the trick. I cooked 2 bone in chops that were about an inch think for 30 then 30. The chops were flavorful and tender. I served with white rice and sautéed yellow squash.

Definitely not a lack of flavor here.  2-3 minutes of frying on each side was enough,  did the entire 5 on some and it was more than enough.  The pesto was an awesome touch, worked out well.  My kids raved over them.

I made this according to the recipe with no deviations. It was delicious. The pork chops just fell apart and the flavor was great. It was super easy to prepare. The sauce makes a nice gravy that I served over some spaghetti squash. Definitely a keeper.

I'm sure there is a reason to bake it for an hour first but I didn't have that time so after browning I added the sauce and baked.  I used think cut chops and they were fine.  I felt the quantity of sauce could have been cut in half of even a third.

We loved it!  I never would have thought to use pesto with the soup.  I think the next time I will use boneless pork chops, but the bone-in worked great.

Followed the recipe with the exception of using cream of mushroom soup and no milk instead of cream of chicken.  We loved it. Will definitely make again.

I always try to stick as closely as possible to recipes the first time so the only change I had to make was using cream of celery soup instead of chicken since that's all I had. Everything else was followed exactly.

OH MY STARS did this come out delicious! Even for thick cut porkchops, which I can never seem to cook properly, the meat practically fell apart. The gravy left in the casserole dish was perfect to pour over the top and, as my husband said, "Ramsay quality". (we're both huge Gordon Ramsay fans)

I will be making this again for sure!!

Picture was taken after pouring on the sauce but before final 30min bake.

Forgot to get a picture but it turned out great! I made fettuccine on the side for the remaining pesto (made a packet, didn't want to save)and added a little more chicken soup for the sauce, and topped with some shaved parmesan. I also made my own bread crumbs with a small processor and some dry seasonings. I wasn't entirely optimistic the breading would stay breading and not turn to mush, but it turned out great. My family doesn't really care for pork chops but we got them on sale, and it's safe to say we'll be using this recipe again. Next time though I'll sear in the pan closer to medium, medium high was too much, I nearly burnt them.

These were SO good!  I used the advice of others, and  broiled the chops instead of frying them, to save cleanup.  The breading seemed to fall off into the gravy...not really a problem, but a surprise.  I only used 3 pork chops, but all the gravy, and served that over baked potatoes.  I make and freeze pesto every summer, so used a bit more than called for, just because I have so much.

Love it!  I used 1 1/2 lbs of really thin cut pork chops, so I reduced the cook time in the oven to a total of 45 minutes, halfway through I spread the sauce on.  I wish I would've made more of the sauce because it was so good! Paired it with mashed potatoes and sautéed broccoli.

Doesn't have a strong overpowering pesto flavor.  Excellent dish, I used thinner chops and about 45 minutes total baking.  They came out fabulous.  My family loved them! Will definitely be making these again!

I really enjoyed this...but then I am a nut for good pesto dishes.  My family was slightly less enthusiastic (they think I am crazy), but still enjoyed it.  Used Chef John's "Proper Pesto" recipe and served over pesto pasta.  I REALLY enjoyed all that pesto and will have this again.

This recipe turn out well. I've made it twice now but next time I will not bake it for the full time called for (as  some chops were a bit over-done).

I will use a meat thermometer next time and cook until the temp gets to 140 F.

The family loved the pork chops! I made it essentially as is, just a bit heavier with the spices. I agree with another reviewer who recommended just 1 cup of bread crumbs as 2 cups would have been wasteful.  I definitely will make it again.

One of the best recipes. Definitely only need to fry on each side about 3 minutes. I cooked for a total of 1 hr at 375. I didn’t have 2 hours to spend in the kitchen. Came out delicious.

Very tasty and tender.  Used cream of mushroom soup and one cup of chicken broth instead because I didn’t have cream of chicken soup and I wanted some gravy for mashed potatoes.  It’s a keeper!!

Really tasty.  I took the advice of adding oregano and rosemary in addition to the other ingredients.  Easy to make and delicious to eat.

Extremely tasty. 1 cup of bread crumbs is plenty, you'll throw out most of two cups

I almost never leave a review and I did change the pesto to basil/garlic butter and OMG this dish was to die for.  Needless to say I over ate!   Cutlet came out moist and there was enough flavor that it required no salt and pepper whatsoeever.  Highly recommend this dish.  Yum.

First time making this recipe. It is delicious. I did find preping time a bit consuming. But my family loved it, kids loved it. I served it with white basmati rice. Will definitely make it again.
