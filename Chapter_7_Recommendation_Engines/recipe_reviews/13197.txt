I had some green beans to use up so this recipe intrigued me.  Other reviewers said it was bland so I made some changes.  I used cambells chicken stock instead of water and added potatoes and veal sausage in addition to the bacon.  I also used about 1 tbsp cornstarch at the end to thicken it slightly.  It was tasty, hearty and enjoyed by all.

I loved this.  I had a couple of other veggies in the fridge to use up, and just threw them in with the beans.  I changed it some by adding extra bacon, onion, and garlic.  I cooked the bacon and onion together, then added in the flour.  Poured some bean soup juice into the bacon onion flour mixture, then put it all in together.  I used the sour cream as a dollop before I served.  These flavors together were just what I was looking for....and believe me, they work together so well.  I appreciate so much your grandma's recipe.....even tho I changed it a little, it was truly delicious!  Even my husband said so.  Thank you.  This was exactly what I was looking for when I searched for a green bean soup...and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Totally delicious.  Thank you. :-)

This had WAY too many green beans and was definitely too watery.  The sour cream did add a good flavor, though it was still pretty bland.  We didn't really like it the first time, so I tweaked it by using a diluted beef stock instead of water, with a touch of worchestershire.  I also added potatoes and more bacon, plus made it much thicker.  That time it was a hit.

Another option would be to cook a ham bone with the green beans, etc. for a few hours and add potatoes near the end of the cooking. I mash the potatoes a little to help thicken it. I also add vinegar and a little sugar to balance the tartness. I don't use sour cream. Recipe was handed down from my great-grandmother. This is definitely comfort food and a very inexpensive soup to make.

I've been searching for a green bean soup recipe since I had it in a restaurant a couple of years ago and loved it. I was thrilled to find this and I'm happy to say that it was as wonderful as I had remembered. My only change was to puree the beans and then used some of the whole ones as a garnish. Thanks Jamie for a wonderful recipe that my whole family found delicious!

I was raised on this soup - my step-father was from Transylvania and made this quite often, especially during the winter.  Instead of bacon, he would cook the beans, etc. with smoked ham hocks or shanks (I've even used smoked turkey leg and it turned out wonderful). I also sometimes add a cup of thinly sliced celery.  It's the roux and sour cream that make this a wonderful, thick soup - goes great with rye bread!

Unfortunately, we did not enjoy this recipe.  I thought it sounded interesting and was excited to try it, but my family and I were disappointed.  I found it to be very bland, and watery.  I even double checked the recipe to see if I went wrong some where, but found I had followed the directions exactly.  I wish I had put the beans through the food processor first, although I don't think that would have saved the recipe for us.

We enjoyed this soup a lot.  Instead of bacon, I used a ham bone and cooked everything (except the sour cream) in the slow cooker for 8 hours.  It needs more than a pinch of salt.  Try 1 1/2 tsp. at least.  Came out fantastic.

This was a great soup that had lots of flavor!  I did half the recipe and it made plenty for two large bowls for lunch.  I do recommend to double the bacon and instead of water to use either vegetable broth or chicken broth and plenty of seasonings.  For the garlic I just smashed it and added it in to get the flavor, then removed it at the end.  I did not like the vinegar.  To hide the vinegar taste, I added in some shredded cheddar cheese to melt.  So next time I will just remember to leave out the vinegar completely for us.  This would be great with chunks of potatoes in it as well.  Nice, simple soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

This did not turn out thick at all when I made it.  If I make it again I will increase the amount of flour I add.  Despite being quite thin, the flavor was pleasant.  Really different from standard American fare.

Very good!  Don't know why folks are complaining about the consistency.  Soup (IMHO) should have some "juice" otherwise I would call it stew. I made some changes for personal taste but nothing drastic. Basically kept the recipe as is.

I added more bacon, and a flower and milk mixture to thicken.  Simmered for 2 hours.  The beans were out of my garden.  This is a super good soup and good for you plus easy to make.  I will make another pot for the freezer.  My wife loves it!

Great recipe. I used light beef stock instead of water, added a few potatos and used a bit more garlic, onion and bacon than required by the recipe. Great taste; I will certainly do this soup again.

Easy to do and yummy! I didn’t have any bacon, so I skipped that part. I added worcheschire per another reviewer’s suggestion, which gave it a good flavor.

This was fantastic!  I grew up eating this.  My grand parents grew green beans in their garden.  It one of my favorite soups.  They made one similar with wilted lettuce too.

Made as directed, but did boil in vegetable broth and added potatoes, extra  garlic  and bacon.  Cut the vinegar to one tablespoon.  Delicious as when my grandmother made it.  Will definitely make again.

When I had completed this recipe step by step it was a bit sour the sour cream and vinegar was overwhelming and I had used smaller portions of both because they are strong flavors. So I added soy sauce, garlic powder, garlic salt, and added more bacon. The taste of the soup was a bit more appealing than it was before but would I make this again, probably not. However, I did enjoy cooking it and the family history behind it.

My husband and I followed some of the other reviewer's recommendations as we made this soup.  instead of the water we cooked the beans in unsalted chicken broth.  We  added one potato and extra bacon.  We liked the taste of the vinegar but may try it without just to taste the difference. Yummy!!

This recipe needed to specify the amount of water needed to begin.  I made the recipe using only one pound of green beans and that was definitely sufficient for the remaining ingredients.   I also added some potatoes and  beef stock.

I added bouillon and it was great. I used fried, crumbled Boca burgers in place of bacon. A nice change of pace!

I read the other reviews and decided to make some changes to the recipe. I added potato and carrot and used yogurt instead of sour cream as I didn't have any sour cream. Like one of the other reviewers, I processed the soup and used some of the beans as a garnish. The flavor is great and I will definitely make this again.

Never having had a green bean soup, I thought this recipe looked interesting. I cooked the green beans in 6 cups of ham stock I had made (chicken would probably work well too). I boiled separately one medium potato diced and one medium carrot diced and added them to the pot once the green beans were cooked. Additionally, I added some sauteed diced ham I had cooked with a medium onion. I had viewed some comparable recipes prior to making this and followed another recipe by adding 3 Tablespoons of sauerkraut with juice in place of vinegar.  I found the blend of favors a bit different  from the more traditional soups I have made. Slightly tangy from the kraut, but otherwise subtle flavors. I will make it again  and serve with dark pumpernickel bread.

I loved this recipe!  I followed others' advice by adding potatoes, extra bacon, and two chicken bouillion cubes.  I decided to change the parsley to dill, and this seemed to add a nice flavour.  I didn't see the need to add the vinegar, so I didn't... it seemed to turn out just fine without it.  Definitely worth a try, if you don't mind modifying recipes to suit your own tastes!!!

Had a bumper crop of mature green beans and made this soup...it was souper:) And my husband loved it; said it reminded him of soup his Grandma used to make.

do not cook onions and bacon together like one reviewer suggested the onions are burn't by the time the bacon is done. Also I thought the vinegar made this probably the worst soup i've ever had.
