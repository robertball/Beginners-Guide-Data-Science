Since I had extra spinach stuffing, I made an variation which actually ended up much better than the original recipe because I found the original recipe to have some what bland chicken, it basically depended on the sauce for the flavor.  (I also added 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese to the stuffing).    With the remaining spinach stuffing, I grabbed 2 more chicken breasts and breaded them with 1 cup Italian bread crumbs mixed with a dash of Italian seasoning, and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (do this after slicing the chicken).  Stuff the chicken and baked for 40 minutes with no sauce, then took it out and put the sauce around the chicken, and in between (not on top), topped the chicken with shredded mozzarella cheese, cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  Serve topped with the sauce.

I cooked this dish twice now and it was delicious! Everyone abolutely loved it! I did use a bit more garlic and I believe I mixed way more ricotta and spinach then neccesary so it was over flowing but it made the sauce on the outside chunkier and everyone was licking their plates clean! I highly recommend trying this one!

I made this for my very picky fiance and it was a hit! He loved i! I stuck to the recipe, just added a little more mozzarella on top. Also, I used my own sauce instead of the jar, but if in a hurry, the Classico sauce is a great one to use. I will definitely keep making this one.

I normally don't rate the recipes I try on here however I couldn't pass this one up! I tried the recipe exactly the way it was written paired it with some whole wheat penne pasta and it was a HIT! My boyfriend normally doesn't eat leftovers however with this dish not only did he eat all the leftovers but ate them for 3 days until they were gone. Needless to say I will be making this again!

This recipe was very helpful especially after reading the previous reviews. The amount suggested for stuffing was a bit much and would not recommend the full 60 minutes but roughly 50 minutes and best to add cheese when chicken is almost fully cooked.

I have made this fabulous recipe several times over the past year.  I like to change up the mix a bit, this time around I added a bunch of fresh basil from my garden into the spinach mix along with a little bit of oregano.  I have also used a couple different types of red sauce, anything goes with this chicken!

My trick with the stuffing part that I find works the best is to cut about a 2" slit in the side of the chicken and using a small paring knife cut out a pocket on the inside of the chicken breast, much like a pita.  This way you can stuff it full of goodness and only have a small opening to close up with tooth pics.  Amazing classic recipe that I will continue to make over and over again.  Thanks Maria!!!

There was too much spinach in this recipe.  Next time, I would use half of what is called for.

Yum! The filling was absolutely delicious Maria! Because I didn't have any tomato sauce in the house  I had to go a different route. I made a roux, added a can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup along with a few seasonings and a quarter cup of Marsala wine and let it simmer for a few minutes. As in the recipe I poured it over the chicken and baked. You can be sure that next time I'll certainly try it with the tomato sauce but in a pinch, this was a very nice flavorful alternative. Thank you Maria!

I made this two times so far - once for a large group of people, and more recently for my boyfriend who is Kenyan, his roommate who is Polish, and their friend. It was a gigantic hit both times. There were no leftovers either time. I made no variations to it either time as the recipe seems to suit tons of different tastes. I HIGHLY recommend this - it is also super easy to make.

My boyfriend loved this! I agree that the amount of stuffing is a little much, I had lots of leftover that I'll use to make stuffed shells later in the week. I didn't put the sauce on top, just added a little chicken broth to the bottom of the pan throughout cooking if it looked like it was getting dry. Came out very very moist and delicious!

This was amazing!! I did make some changes, i used Gorgonzola and feta cheese instead of ricotta.  I also sauteed my own spinach with a lot more garlic.  Then boiled a box of whole wheat penne pasta and poured it over the chicken and then the sauce and then the cheese.  Cooked it for an hour and a half.  Amazing!!!!

I fixed this 9-16-11. My 6 member family loved it!! The only changes that I would make would be to flatten the chicken breast and roll the stuffing. Maybe add a little more spices as it is a little bland. It makes alot of stuffing so I just put it around the chicken. Use maybe a different sauce for flavor!!

Simple and delicious. I served it with whole grain pasta, and baked garlic parm zucchini.  I found that I had a lot of extra stuffing ( made 6 large breasts) so will half the recipe for the stuffing next time.

This recipe was delicious!! Wouldn't change a thing with it. I made it per the recipe and had enough stuffing to make six good size chicken breasts. My boyfriend, who is generally afraid of these types of dishes, is still raving about it!! Thank you for the recipe!

I made some changes to this recipe, but it turned out wonderfully! I added parmesan and mozzarella to the stuffing, and seasoned the chicken with parsley, Italian seasoning, basil, red pepper flakes and garlic. I also added mozzarella to the sauce. This meal was to die for!

Was absolutely delicious! I used twice as much fresh spinach (saute'd with lots of garlic), and replaced the mozzarella with 1/2 cup parm cheese. Thanks for the great recipe. It's a keeper!

After some modifications, this was so delicious. The first time I made it, I didn't change anything. It was good, but I felt like it needed more flavor. The next time, I played with the recipe. I added some seasoning salt, and I actually didn't have spinach, so I added diced onion and red bell pepper. I didn't even use the mozzarella, and it was still amazing! 

For me, extra garlic, and seasoning salt of some kind were key!

I have made this over 5 times now but have yet to review this...

I omit the egg, I find no use for it and the dish turned out perfect.

I also used fresh spinach.  Roughly 2 cups.

Great recipe for its suggestive ingredients and their amounts, but I never follow them.  I just wing it most of the time with the amounts and its flawless every time.

I decided to add roughly 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. YUM

Here's how to make this 5 stars (I've experimented with the dish many times now and it can be awesome--thanks for sharing it): Add to spinach mixture 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1 Tablespoon Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, ground black pepper to taste. Re. the sauce, you can use any, but for best results, I use 2/3 vodka sauce (can be bought at the grocery store right by the regular sauces), 1/3 Italian tomato sauce, and 1/2 cup white cooking wine (combined). Excellent flavor. Bake 50 minutes. OR you can use the alternative others have suggested: roll breasts in spiced bread crumbs first, bake 40 minutes, top with cheese and baked another 10, then top with the sauce. We like it both ways. This is now a family fave and go-to dish for entertaining guests.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The ricotta and spinach is a great mixture.  My only complaint is that I was left with WAY too much.  I'll need to reduce the recipe next time.  And I'm going to add more garlic next time, as well.

I normally hate it when people rate a recipe that they've modified, but I only modified this because of what I had on hand.  Basically I made this ALMOST as written, except I used half the ricotta (I only had a small container) and double the tomato sauce (I didn't want to waste half a jar).  I also just used 4 whole chicken breasts instead of halves.  I found that with these modifications it was GREAT!  The next time I make this I would do it the same way as I served it over spaghetti and any less sauce wouldn't have been enough and I didn't notice that it had less cheese.
