To save you teh time of looking through over 200 reviews,here is the general consensus of the previous reviews:This cheesecake is awesome. But double the cheesecake ingredients or it will be runny. Microwave the apples for a few minutes to soften them before adding them to the topping. Bake in a water bath if possible, or at least put a pan of water on the oven rack below. Bake at least 70 minutes and let cool in the oven with the door open for 45 minutes to an hour. I used all these tips and was glad. I add these tips of my own: You can omit the pecans in the crust and add more graham cracker crumbs. An apple corer/peeler/slicer is perfect for this recipe. Finally, in a small bowl I mixed a handful of brown sugar, a handful of flour and cut in a few small chunks of butter and spread it over the top of the apples befor baking. It created a light crumb crust which was awesome and improved the apprearance of the cheesecake (which seemed to be a concern to other reviewers). Great recipe! Good luck!

In a word - Fabulous! If you LOVE apples and you LOVE cheesecake then this dessert is for you! I had my eye on this for a while and decided to make this for Thanksgiving and was so glad I did! The crust is awesome. The cheesecake itself is oh so creamy - definitely double it for this recipe as this is more of a New York Style cheesecake. The topping is equally delightful. You really need to microwave the apples to get them tender first. I also took the advice of another reviewer and did a streusel topping - flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter combined until crumbly. I threw that over top before baking the cheesecake in a water bath (definitely do a water bath). This cheesecake turned out so incredibly good that I'll definitley be making this again!

This really is fabulous.  After reading the multitude of reviews, I opted to increase the cream cheese to 3 pkgs., added one egg, and increased cooking time by 15 min. For the crust, I found graham crackers that were a combination of sugar, cinnamon and oats. To this I added half the sugar and additional cinnamon, and it seemed to require extra butter to hold together. This was the best crust I've ever tasted! I chose to use Macintosh apples, which I tossed with the pecans and a tablespoon of caramel sauce.  I was concerned about the apples making the cake watery, so I microwaved them for a minute before putting them on top.  I discarded about 1/2 Cup of juice, which may have affected the setting of the batter. You can taste the apples throughout the cake. Divine. I also used a water bath and kept it in the oven for 2 hours to cool. This rivals any cheesecake I have had, from any source. My recipe guinea pigs (coworkers)were extremely pleased. Go for it!

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  As suggested, I added 1 pkg cream cheese, 1 egg, 1/4 c sugar, and 1/4 tsp vanilla to make the filling thicker.  I also added ~1/2 tsp cinnamon to the filling to give it a little kick.  I used Fiji apples and also as suggested, I microwaved them (with the cinnamon & sugar) for about a minute and then put them on top of the cheesecake (w/o the juice).  I baked it in a water bath for about 70 minutes and it turned out beautifully!  Everyone at the party was shocked by my baking ability!!  I definitely recommend making this the night before as the cheesecake will get a chance to firm up and it will be even more fabulous!

Much has been written about doubling the crust and filling ingredients and pre-cooking the apples - all great tips. Not as much, however, has been said about the wonderful texture and creaminess of this cheesecake. I'm sure the water bath has a lot to do with this, so don't skip this step. The filling is so good I think I'll use it as a standard recipe to use with other add-ins and toppings.

I preheated my oven with a pan of water under the rack (rather than the water bath).  For the crust, I 1-1/2'd the ingredients so I could reserve half for the topping, since some people said a more streusel-like topping was better looking/tasting. For that, I cut in butter chunks rather than melted it.  For the apples, I thinly sliced (less than 1/8 inch) four Galas, then cut them into smaller sections so the  cheesecake would be easier to slice (as some recommended).  Then I microwaved the apples for one minute (to soften and remove some moisture, as recommended).  After tossing with the cinnamon and sugar, I drained the excess moisture from the bowl.  For the filling, I decided to increase the ingredient amounts to 1-1/2 times since some people said the original recipe was too thin.  Once the crust had cooled, I poured in the filling and then spooned the apples on top.  Over that, I sprinkled about a third of the streusel mix and then reserved the rest to add during the last 15 minutes in case it overbrowned (as some people indicated).  I baked for 60 minutes, then checked it.  The topping had not overbrowned, but I added about another third of it to the cheesecake (it didn't need any more than that) and baked for another 15 minutes (total of 75 minutes).  I removed it from the oven and let it cool for approximately 20 minutes before removing the sides of the pan and refrigerating it.  My husband said it was "amazing"; PERFECT in texture and flavor.  Thank you!

Well, call me a believer now.  I'm now a part of the Autumn Cheesecake fanclub.  I just served it for a dinner party and it was sensational!  I enjoy cheesecake but will only have a small slice of it because it's so heavy and thick; this one I had 3 helpings of and I had to stop myself from getting another one.  Seriously, my husband helped himself to numerous slices and couldn't stop raving about it.  I've been burned from cheesecake recipes over the years--just too many not-so-great ones.  I made the Better Homes & Garden praline pecan cheesecake last year (major effort) and it tasted gooey and way too cheesy.  You felt like you had enough after the first bite.  But this one...well, it's in another class.  It's an exceptional cheesecake and I'm so happy "Stephanie" put the recipe online.  Just a note: I got a little confused about whether or not to press the crust up the sides of the springform pan. Usually recipes specifically state to do that. This one didn't. So for you people trying cheesecake for the first time, you need to press the graham cracker crumbs onto the bottom and up the side of the pan to form the complete crust (maybe it's just me).  And I used Fuji apples cut up very small, which gave it a crispness that I loved.  Just do it!!!

This was a HUGE hit at a cheesecake party.  I made the following changes after reading pages of reviews:  I doubled the crust mixture, and sprinkled half on the top with 20 minutes left to bake, I doubled the filling, I chopped the apples and then microwaved them until they were soft and drained the liquid before tossing with sugar.  It was beautiful and awesome!

I would give six stars if I could. It does have a good amt of prep time to it, if you don't want to feel rushed I would suggest peeling/coring/slicing the apples before starting on the rest of the recipe. I didn't do it until the cheesecake was in the pan and ready for them so I prepared them as fast as I could - and came really close to slicing my finger. I doubled the filling after setting my two 8oz cubes next to the springform and realizing how little filling there would be. It's also a good idea to microwave the apples for two minutes before putting them on top of the filling - gets some of the juice out and softens them a little. Drizzle the slices with chocolate syrup and caramel for a finishing touch!

If it were possible I would give this recipe 10 stars!  It was very easy to make, it looked beautiful and it tasted marvelous!  I doubled the cheesecake mixture and baked it in a hot water bath... left it in the oven for an hour after it was done and refrigerated it overnight.  We also drizzled hot caramel sauce over the top before serving.  It was amazing!  I think the only thing I would do differently next time I make it is to cut the apples into smaller pieces as they don't cut easily when slicing.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

Great with changes.  I used 3 pkgs cream cheese, 3 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla, and 3/4 c sour cream.  The first time I made this, I did not add the sour cream, and the cheesecake part turned out very dense.  The sour cream greatly improved the texture by making it lighter.  I used an apple wedger to cut 3 medium granny smiths, and I cut each wedge into 3rds for a thinner slice.  Like others, I microwaved the apples for 2.5 minutes to get rid of the excess moisture.  To prevent water from seeping into the springform, I put the springform in a crockpot liner and tied the excess in a knot to make it fit the pan securely.  Foil never seems to do a perfect job of keeping out the water for me.  I also drizzled caramel topping just before serving.  This won first place at my office dessert contest.

This recipe is wonderful.  My family loves it. I will definitely bring this whereever I need to make a dessert.  For those who find the cheese part on the thin side, I added 1 pkg more of cream cheese, 1 additional egg, 1/4 cup sugar and a few extra drops of vanilla.  It was perfect.

I would give this recipe 5 stars if I hadn't made any of the changes as suggested.  It is a FABULOUS recipe.  The cheesecake itself is a perfect BASIC cheesecake recipe - absolutely perfect!!!  And you could use almost any fruit topping with it - peaches, pineapples (well-drained), bananas, etc...  Here are the changes I made: -I added 2 T of butter to the crust as is - it was too crumbly with just 1/4 cup of butter.  Next time I think I may add 50% more ingredients for a thicker crust. Cheesecakes only have a bottom crust, not sides... just fyi. -I added 1 pkg of cream cheese, 1 egg, 1/4 cup of  sugar and 1/2 t of vanilla for more filling. -I used 1/2 Granny Smith and 1/2 Gala apples for the topping. -I microwaved the apples until they were hot and soft drained as much excess juice as I could. -I used BROWN sugar instead of white to coat the apples after I microwaved the apples.  This left me with a brown sugar, cinnamon syrup.  I drizzled half over the apples after I spiraled them on the cake and I used the remaining syrup to coat the pecans before sprinkling them over the cake. -I used a water bath.  To bake your cheesecake in a water bath use several layers of industrial foil to cover the outside of the spring form pan.  Set in 1 to 2 in. of warm water when putting in the oven. -I baked it at ****325**** for 1 hr & 20 min.  I turned off the oven and cracked the door to let it cool (3 hrs) before I put it in the fridge to chill. -I drizzled each slice with caramel topping.

This was the hit of Easter! Husband requested "Caramel Apple Cheescake" for Easter. So, I did make a couple of changes. I took other's advice and added extra cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla, also I added 4oz of toffee bits. Yum! And drizzled Smucker's caramel topping over it. Also, the way to cook a perfect cheesecake is to bake cake at 425 for the first 15 mins and then reducing the temp. to 225 comtinue cooking for about 1 hr and 15-20 mins. Try this method and see if you do not have better results. I can't wait to make this again. It is SO easy!! Thank you Stephanie my husband is so gratful, too!!!

I have never made cheesecake before and was leery about trying to make one.  However, I am having company for Thanksgiving and wanted to try and make one for desert.  I usually read reviews for alterations, on the recipe however, I did not.  I was very worried after I read all the reviews, since i did not double up, use a water bath, or make any of the other modifications.  I followed the instructions exactly and it came out perfectly.  The taste, the consistency, was all perfect!!!  I love the taste of the crust, the cheesecake filling and the crunchiness of the apples on top.  I will make it exactly the same way for Thanksgiving.

This is BY FAR the best dessert I make. Even my husband who doesn't like cheesecake loves this dessert. I don't like cheesecake either and love it. Definitely double the filling, mocrowave the apples for 2 minutes, add WAY more cinnamon sugar than it calls for, make an apple layer  half way through with nuts for interest, and do a crumb topping on top and you won't have to worry about the apples drying out!

If I could give this a zero I would, the cheese cake went flat, even though it cooked it for 65 mins and followed the instructions exactly. If I left it in a few minutes more it would have burned! I thought with all the great reviews it'd be amazing... I'll probably give it one more try, but I’m not sure it will make a difference.

Great recipe; great taste.  Followed all the suggestions that I felt were appropriate.  Doubled the cream cheese mixture because I wanted it thicker, and cooked it for about 70-80 minutes.  Added pan of water to keep it moist and took the suggestion of leaving both the pan and the cheesecake in the oven for another hour with the oven turned off.  Turned out great! The only thing I would do different is to put the nuts on the cheesecake towards the end of baking time (maybe about 30 minutes prior to taking it out).  The pecans were a little too brown.

I made this recipe exactly like the recipe stated.  I bake often and had absolutely no problems with this recipe.  I brought the cheesecake to a work function and it received rave reviews.  People were really intrigued by the novelty of combining apples and cheesecake.  I loved how great this cake looks.

This cheesecake was really good. I used granny smith apples and doubled the cheese mixture I baked it for about 80 minutes, it turned out really creamy! Wonderful when topped with caramel sauce.

I made this in a 6-inch instead so that the filling would be thick. I only decreased the amount of ingredients for the crust and the apples, but kept the filling the same as recipe. It turned out amazing! I took the leftovers to work four days later and people still raved --even the ones who work at a cooking magazine!

Divine! I prepared this as written making no adjustments or additions; following the ingredients, directions and baking time exactly. While the cream cheese came to room temperature I prepared the crust. I used Honey Graham crackers for the crust and 2 Fuji apples for the topping. I baked the cheesecake in a springform pan for 75 minutes with a pan of water on the bottom rack, then turned off the oven and allowed the cheesecake to cool for about an hour and a half with the oven door slightly open. My entire house smelled like cinnamon and apples- so heavenly! I then removed it and I chilled it in the refrigerator for a while before serving. The blend of flavors in the cheesecake is absolutely wonderful. Not only is this flavorful but it’s rich, creamy and a little on the dense side.. The topping is delightful with thin slices of apples and crunchy pecans making this a pretty cheesecake. The crust is so wonderful – buttery flavorful and nutty. Next time I will double the filling and make a crumb topping of flour, brown sugar, and butter cut into the mixture to sprinkle over the cheesecake. I might even take NOELC suggestion and make her crumb topping mixture of brown sugar, a handful of flour and cut in a few small chunks of cold butter and spread it over the top of the apples before baking. This really is a delightful dessert and perfect for this time of the year.

I used the popular suggestions by reviewer NoelC.  I baked for 80 minutes, then turned off the oven and left the cheesecake inside to cool, oven door closed, for two hours.  Then, cooled on the counter for two more hours, then refrigerated overnight.  In the morning: DELICIOUS!  Makes an impressive presentation and tastes wonderful.  I wanted to give this a test run first, but I will definitely be adding this to the Thanksgiving menu.  I used an apple-peeler-slicer-corer, and my only change for next time would be to microwave the apples for less time (maybe 90 seconds?) as they were so soft they somewhat fell apart as I was placing them in a spiral design on top.  This was my first time using a springform pan and making a cheesecake crust from scratch - easy to do and so worth it!

Wonderful! I did 2 cps of crumbs for the crust with no pecans. Increased the cream cheese to 3 pkgs, 3 eggs and 3/4 tsp vanilla. I used 2 good sized Fiji apples. My husband said it's the best cheesecake he's ever ate and it might be his new favorite dessert of all! Thanks

Wow... if only more stars were possible! I needed a cheesecake recipe for people who have never eaten cheesecake, and whom I greatly wanted to impress: wow did I choose right! I followed almost all of the advice, I made one and a half times the crust and the filling, microwaved the apples for just under 2 minutes and drained the excess juice after mixing with the sugar/cinn, per another reviewer, I made a crumble topping with flour, pecans, brown sugar, and melted butter to sprinkle over top, and cooked it in a gas oven at 200ºC. I inserted a pan of water underneath (instead of a water bath as suggested by some) and honestly don't know that it made a big difference, but it was moist!  I refridgerated it over night but it was firm in a couple of hours.  Absolutely amazing. I couldn't find graham crackers in the country I'm living in, but substituted these cookies which are similar in texture but a little sweeter, so I halved the sugar/cinn added to the crust.  Everything was perfect and a huge sucess (my first time making cheesecake!) Thanks!!

What can I say about this recipe that hasn't already been said? It is AWESOME. For the most part I followed the recipe exactly, although I did add a brown sugar/butter/flour crumb topping about halfway through the baking process, and I added the pecans at that time. The pecans still browned a little more than I would've liked, so I will add them even later next time. I also set a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake. I did not double the cheesecake ingredients. It did not come out runny at all, but it was very thin using the 9 inch pan. I will try it doubled next time. Over all, this is an amazing recipe that is both delicious and visually appealing. I highly recommend it. Thanks!

I have made this 3 times now. The first was for a pre-Thanksgiving test run, the second was for Thanksgiving, and the third was for my mother-in-law's annual Christmas baking contest at the university where she works, and it won first place! I double the cream cheese mixture, soften the apples in the microwave, and top with a cinnamon struesel and pecans every time.

Very, very good! I followed the recipe as written.  Used 3 Fuji apples thinly sliced.  The only thing I would change  is to chop the apples instead of slice so that it is easier to cut the cake.  The apple slices tend to move when you are slicing.

EXCELLENT!!!  I got rave reviews on this one and a few "It looks like it came from a professional" comments.  I would change the name to Apple Pie Cheesecake to more accurately described this dessert.  I did made a few modifications after reading others' reviews.  

Here's how I made this one:  I increased the ingredients by 1/2.  Prepared the crust as directed.  While the crust was pre-baking, I peeled, cored, and thinly sliced the apples then tossed them in the cinnamon/sugar.  I made the filling as directed.  When everything was ready, I poured about 1/2 the filling into the crust,  drained the apples and layered them top.  I poured in the remaining filling and placed the apples slices in circles around the top.

I baked it IN A WATER BATH for 45 minutes.  When the timer dinged I scattered about 1/4 c. chopped pecans around the top and baked for another 15 min.  Once the timer dinged again, I turned off the oven AND LEFT IT ALONE for about 1 to 1-1/2 hours.  After it had cooled I put it in the frig.  The next morning I took it out of the pan and put the fully cooled cheesecake on a platter.  It looked beautiful.  

I thought it need a little something extra so I drizzled caramel sauce over the top - just a little bit.

The finished cake tasted so good.  The inside layer of apples turned out tasting really good but  separated from the filling so I'd skip that part next time.  

Sounds like a lot of work but it was really, really easy.  I highly recommend this one.

I like this but think I'll modify it some next time.  I will DEFINETLY dice the apples on top as opposed to slicing them thin to make it easier to cut.  I also felt the pecans on top were kind of bland, may toss them with some cinammon sugar and then sprinkle on or may ommit them all together.

Fantastic! I've made it twice this week and everyone loved it! The first time I made it, I increased the cream cheese by 8 oz., and the sugar and eggs proportionately (1/4 c. sugar and 1 egg). Before serving, I piped on whipped cream sweetened with brown sugar. Mmmmmm!  The second time, I made it exactly the same, but I made a crumb topping (as for French Apple Pie) and spread that over the top before baking.  When it was cool, I made a powdered sugar and milk glaze and drizzled it on the top.

I was the hit of my luncheon today with this wonderful dessert!!!!!!  I did    use more crumbs and butter to make the crust go up about an inch.  Unfortunately, I didn't use as many apples as the recipe called for because once I started putting them on top of the cream cheese layer, it looked like too many.  Don't be fooled!!  They will shrink as they cook!!  Whoops!!  none the less, this dessert rocked!!!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  thanks!!!!!!!!!!!1

I doubled the filling and added a touch of hot caramel upon serving to complete the opposing dessert sensations (hot/cold,sweet/tart,crisp/smooth), everyone raved. I am known for my baking skills with my family, friends, and coworkers. If they only knew how easy it was with the help of this website and recipes like this!! I can't thank you enough!

This cheesecake (incase you haven't noticed by now) is amazing!  I have an addition of my own to add for a topping.  When I made this recipe I followed advice to mircowave the apples before baking, and after I drained them I was left over with about a quarter cup of cider tasting liquid which I decided to turn into a spiced apple cider sauce to drizzle over the top of the cheesecake.  It was very easy to make, you just need:

3 tbsp butter (melted)
1/2 cup sugar
1 beaten egg
2 tbps of brandy (whisky or bourbon works as well)
2 tbps drained juice from cinnimon apples

Cream the butter, sugar and apple juice together and blend in the already beaten egg.  Put this in a double broiler over gently boiling water and stir for about 5 minutes until the sauce starts to thicken.  Remove from heat and add the brandy.  

The sauce tastes just like spiced apple cider and it tastes amazing when drizzled warm over a slice of cheesecake.

This was described as "the best thing ever" by several of the people I sent samples to, and I then received a special order for it from 4 different people.  
This is a BEAUTIFUL cheesecake, great even if it cracks (which shouldn't happen if you don't overbeat after you add the eggs) since you can cover it with the pecans and apples.
I doubled the recipe except for the apples, I used about 2 1/2 very large MacIntosh apples very thinly sliced, spread evenly over the top then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, and the pecans.  I drizzled caramel over the top when it was done cooking.  
I followed the instructions given by NOELC, some stated above and the cook for 70 minutes then leave in the oven for 45-60 minutes with the oven off and the door cracked.
Thank you for this recipe.

I made this for a dinner party with apples as the theme ingredient, and it was very well received by all (even after five courses of apple-based food!).  Positives: fantastic flavor, great texture, good eats.  Negatives: The cake was hard to present neatly because you are slicing through two different textures (apples forming a layer that requires a serrated knife, soft cheesecake below) -- so some slices came out better looking than others.  Using a serrated knife to cut might help.  Variations from the recipe: I added nutmeg to the crust and apple mix, doubled the vanilla in the cheesecake, doubled the pecans on top (I might add even more next time), and baked in a springform with a pan of boiling water on the shelf below.  I also spread out the apples in layers and then drizzled the remaining liquid over them, rather than "spooning" the mixture on as the recipe directs.  I used Golden Delicious apples, and it took me just three large ones to come out with four cups of thin (~1/8") slices.  The cake baked perfectly in 60 minutes, and I refrigerated it for six hours before serving -- definitely allow adequate chilling time in the coldest part of your fridge.  Enjoy!

Use a water bath and turn off the oven and leave the cake in for an hour after it's cooking time is up, for those who have complained that this has a runny center and that it cracked!  

This is an excellent recipe!  We took it to a football party and it was gone before all the other desserts had even been cut!  We put glazed pecans on top with sliced apples in a nice spiral pattern.  We've been bombarded with requests for the recipe.  This will definitely be on our Thanksgiving dessert table this year.  

Update!  I have had over 10 requests for this cheesecake for other friend's Thanksgiving dinners.  Extra money for Christmas shopping! :D

Wow, this was my first cheesecake and came out amazing!  I followed some helpful reviews:  A)  Doubled the cheesecake ingredients.  B)  Microwaved the apples for a few minutes before topping and discarded the juice.  C)  Sat my springform pan (double-wrapped in foil) in a water bath.  D)  Baked 70 minutes and let it cool in the oven for 3 hours (didn't even open the oven to peek).  E)  Topped w/ a streusel topping.  F)  Removed the bottom of my springform pan w/ a knife that had been run under hot water.  Next time, I will put the pan of water on the rack below, rather than putting the spring-form pan into it, because the moisture from the steam became trapped inside the foil and the bottom was just a tad soggy.

I made this for Christmas day dinner and my guests raved about it but I thought it was just ok :( I didn't' like the texture of the cheesecake - it's heavy and thick. I prefer a more fluffy cheesecake. Also, the apple mixture turned out quite dry but that's my own fault for following reviewer suggestions and precooking the apples and removing some of the juice. If I were to make it again, I'd leave the apples uncooked as the recipe states. I did however multiply the recipe by 1.5 in order to better fill my pan.

This was great!  I doubled the crust and cream cheese mixture.  I'm glad I did, because otherwise it would be a very short cheesecake.  I baked it a few minutes longer than stated here, because of the extra filling, until the temperature in the middle registered 160 degrees.  Chilled it overnight and it was absolutely perfect the next day.  Will make again.

This Autumn Cheesecake is just wonderful. I did follow the review by NOCLE and it worked perfectly. I did add a carmel sauce on top and the cheesecake was gone in minutes. To make the Camel Sauce: In a small saucepan add 1) 1/2 c brown sugar 2) add 1/4 c. butter 3) 1 Tablespoon clear corn syrup. When sugar has incorporated 4)add a Tablespoon of cream. Drizzle over the cheesecke.  This is so yummy...and perfect for a fall dessert.

Five stars but definitely incorporate the tips others have shared (i.e. double the cheesecake part and microwave the sliced apples in sugar before putting them on top of the cheesecake mixture). I also did quickly throw together a crumb topping as suggested by a fellow reviewer simply because I love that stuff. I also incorporate basic cheesecake-making tips such as have ingredients at room temp, bake in water bath (or with a pan full of boiling hot water beneath the cheesecake). My cheesecake turned out picture perfect!!! But I don't have a picture to post because we all devoured it before one could be taken! Served with a caramel topping drizzled all over, it looked as good as it tasted!

Oh my goodness. I don't think this could get any better, I made it exactly as the recipe says to, and it turned out amazingly! The flavors all work together SO perfectly! You need to use non-juicy apples, though, I think that's why some people had trouble with juicyness, just use baking apples, and it should all be cool! But anyway, this is absolutely amazing and I'm SO glad I tried it!!

This was awesome!  The only change I did was to microwave the apples for 2 minutes before pouring onto the cheesecake.  The consistance turned out perfect!

Exellent cheesecake. The only thing I change is to double the filling for a fuller cake.  I bake it about 30-35 minutes longer.

Very good! I have made this cake several times now, and the first time I did it according to the directions. After that, I have followed advice of others, and added an extra pkg cream cheese, extra egg, etc. Much more cheesecake this way!! Baked in a water bath. I also prefer to put half the filling in the pan, then add the apples, then top it off with the remainder of cream cheese mix. The apples don't dry out that way, and it leaves a beautiful white canvas on top just begging to be decorated. I must be careful to watch the baking time, as the cheesecake dries out faster without the apples on top to keep it moist.

I made this dessert for my first ever family dinner and it was a huge hit!  What a great alternative for the usual apple pie.  I also took other people's suggestions and it turned out perfectly.  Draining the apple's before placing them on the cheescake is a must! I'm making this again at Christmas!

Delicious. I had to rate it only 4 stars because of all the modifications necessary. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used 3 packages of cream cheese and 3 eggs, and I cooked the apples in the microwave to get rid of some of the water in them. I also sprinkled on a crumb topping to improve the appearance, again as suggested by a previous reviewer. The reciped is definitely a keeper.

Yum! The only thing I would do is put tinfoil over the top to keep the apples from burning. It was gone right away!

Yum. I followed the recipe exactly. Well, except I used low-fat cream cheese, and I baked the cheesecake for an extra hour on accident. The topping was dark brown and burnt looking, but it didn't taste burnt at all!  I used Golden Delicious apples. It smelled just wonderful when coming out of the oven. After I took it out of the oven, I let it cool. As soon as it cooled, I put it in the freezer for about an hour, and it was just the right temperature. My family loved it. I will be making this again and again.

Good recipe, but we should've followed some of the tips (any of them).  The apples were a little runny while baking and we had chunks of cream cheese in the batter.  If we had followed the directions better then it would have turned out a lot better.  I only used 2 apples because we had huge ones.

I did 1 1/2 the cheese filling and this was perfect, and cooked the apples in the microwave for 2 minutes prior to baking, I would suggest to cook them in the microwave for atleast 4 minutes before baking. This definately needs to chill before eating (I was extremely anxious to try :-) ) and enjoyed it much better after it chilled over night. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is heaven in a springform pan! I used Golden Delicious apples, and took other reviewers' advice of increasing cream cheese, sugar, egg and vanilla - excellent. Another tip - make sure you preheat your water bath! My first one came out a little soft in the middle at 75 minutes, I preheated my water and the second one was perfect in the same amount of time. Thanks for the wonderful recipe Stephanie!

This was great!  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it.  I read the rest of the reviews, and decided to add an extra pkg. of cream cheese, 1 additional egg, and added another 1/4 cup of sugar to the mixture.  I baked it 65 minutes with a pan of water in the oven to keep it moist.  I will definately make this time and time again!

I made this for a ladies get-togeter. Extremely eye-appealing; huge hit!Everybody asked me for the recipe. I did use 3 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese instead of 2, added one egg, and altered the vanilla to 1 tsp. for the filling portion.

WOW! This cheesecake is so great!
I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it...we even ate it for breakfast the next morning. It's the first cheesecake i have ever tried making and it turned out great (not a lot of the actual cheese filling though, but you can change that if you want). It looked and tasted just as good as (if not better than) the cheesecake at many dessert places. I also tried another popular cheesecake recipe from this site, but it wasn't nearly as good as this one!
mmmm, thanks : )

I'm actually thinking of making this cheesecake for my birthday (my first cheesecake ever) and I'm relatively new to the whole baking scene. How exactly would you do a water bath since it is so highly recommended by all of the reviewers. Plz get back to me as soon as possible.

I love this cake.  I have always used a Bain Marie method of baking my cheesecakes.  You can use any large flat bottomed roasting pan.  Place your cheese cake in the spring form pan , into the roasting pan,  Half fill the large pan with warmed water.   Cheese cake wont burn and wont crack.

Fantastic!!  Made this for a gathering and didn't come home with a single piece!  Followed the crust instructions exactly.  I doubled the filling ingredients to make a thicker/taller cake.  Kept the amount of apples the same, I followed others advice of microwaving the slices for a couple of minutes to drain out some of the moisture.  So glad I did!  After cooling in the fridge & right before serving, I drizzled some caramel sauce on the top.  Out of this world good!!!

All the reviews are pretty much spot on. I make cheesecakes for my job & use the basic 3 8 oz. cream cheese, 3 egg, 3/4 c. sugar, 1 tsp. van. recipe. For the top, after microwaving the apples, lay in concentric circles. If you want to save having to use more butter/sugar, brush apples with melted apple jam after cooling cake in the oven for an hour. Pretty!

Love this cheesecake!  Always get rave reviews when I make it.  Not too rich.  Follow the recipe exactly.  I don't understand how people say this is not good, especially when they don't follow the recipe!!  You cannot subsitute a store-bought crust for this crust.  It is one of my favorite things about this recipe.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

* First, how I made it: I doubled the cream filling and the crust. Used 1.5 of the crust, topped it with 1/2 cream, then put the apples, then the rest of the cream and finally sprinkled the rest of the crust above it all. Baked it in a water bath, let it cool for 1 hour with the oven door open, and then refrigerated it.
* Comments: Nice presentation and taste. One of the best desserts ever! It misses #1 because it was a bit too sweet for my liking - definately not a chees-y cheesecake. So, next time I am thinking of cutting the sugar in half for the cream, and reducing it to 60% for the rest of the dessert, and I bet the result will be this: A family classic for decades to come! Thanks for sharing!
* UPDATE: This time, I didn't cut the apples in cubes, and put them between two layers of cream filling, as the first time. Instead, I sliced them really thin and baked them in the oven for 10 minutes (mixed with sugar and cinnamon). They were really tender, and I put them on top (better presentation). Also, I used half the overall amount of sugar suggested in this recipe. It was MUCH better this time!

This is an excellent dessert.  I did not use nuts in the crust.  As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the filling (I think it would have been very skimpy otherwise).  I did not find the water bath to be needed during baking.  The last time I made this without one it still turned out perfect.  I did not have to microwave the apples - just tossed them with cinnamon and sugar and placed them on top.  Overall this is easy and tastes fantastic.

I am not the biggest cheesecake fan, but based on other reviews, I had to try this. I took others' suggestions and made 1 1/2 times the filling with light cream cheese. I used 2/3 of it on the bottom, then covered with the apples (which I prebaked in the microwave for 2 minutes), and then usd the remaining 1/3 filling over the apples. For the topping I also did as others suggested and made some additional crust mixture. I added in some brown sugar and butter for a delicious topping. All and all it was a special occasion type-of-dessert that was well recieved by my guests :)

Wow this was good and looks great!  I would definitely make 1 1/2 the amount of cheesecake and add the crumb topping, which just tops it off (I did 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. flour, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon & 1 Tbsp. butter).  The only other thing I would suggest is to make sure it sets in the refrigerator overnight or at least for about 8 hours prior to serving so the cheesecake is firm (mine was mushy after only being in the refrig. for 3 hours).  Great recipe!

Wonderful recipe with a few changes!!!
First of all for the crust I used honey roasted peanuts instead of pecans and I ground them into small pieces. Then for the filling I used three 8 oz pkgs of cream cheese. I also used an extra egg. The consistency turned out perfect! I added some caramel sauce (the kind for ice cream) on top of the cream cheese layer then put the apples and more honey roasted peanuts that I crushed and tossed on a handful of whole peanuts. The peanuts gave it more of a nutty caramel apple taste. I also microwaved and squeezed the apple slices and I used half of a granny smith apple. I then let it cool and before serving drizzled even more caramel sauce over the top. It was a huge hit--not a slice was left!!

Absolutely delicious and wonderful appearance.....I will definitely make this again....I too followed some of the recommendations (doubled cheesecake filling, heated apples in microwave and drained, doubled crust recipe and sprinkled extra over apples before baking).

Incredible! This was the first time I've made a cheesecake and I was a bit apprehensive. However, this turned out perfect! I followed the advice of others and microwaved the apples first as well as drain them before putting them on the cheesecake. I would also recommend the pecans if you can get them. They really add a nice crunch and taste to the cheesecake.

This is a favorite of mine.  I've made it several times and it always gets rave reviews. The first time I made it, the filling was not nearly enough so after that I always doubled it. I once served it with caramel sauce and my guests went wild!

I received many requests for this recipe after I made it.  It was wonderful.  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I had an 8 1/2 inch pan which was perfect. I didn't have to double the filling but I did add 1 extra block of cream cheese and 1/4 c sugar, 1/4 t vanilla and 1 egg. I did double the crust and added a little more butter and used brown sugar.  Half the crust I put in the bottom of the pan and sprinkled the top of the cake with the rest.  One note I will make, if you are making this recipe in a hurry and are doubling the filling at all.....be advised the baking time will take longer than the time on the original recipe.  I was late to my dinner waiting for it to bake!

This cheesecake was simply wonderful. I loved the way it smelled while it was baking. I didn't make any changes to the original recipe, except I would use fewer apples next time. I had quite a bit left over, but they were good for snacking. Next time I would use more butter in the crust because it was very crumbly when cutting and serving.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  It is so delicious and a great change from the ordinary cheesecake.  Very unique...tastes wonderful!  I have made it 3 times and it is ALWAYS a hit. I doubled the filling. This time, I used walnuts instead of pecans, drained juice from apples before putting on mixture.  I also mixed 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour and a handful of walnuts and melted butter and sprinkled over apples.  I used a 10 inch pan and baked for 70 minutes in a water bath.

I have made this cheesecake a number of times and its always gone in a flash.  I always double this recipe, arrange the apple slices and when its done I drizzle carmal sauce, add loads of pecans and i top it off with even more carmal.  No one ever believes that it's not store bought.

A fantabulous recipe!! I made it for a birthday and everyone was blown away.  I bought a ready-made crust (which was perfect for toting to a birthday party, because it comes with its own plastic cover) and added a little more vanilla to the cheesecake filling.  I did not increase the cheescake filling (which was absolutely fine in the ready made crust), nor did I precook the apples.  However, I cut/coated the apples several hours prior to baking the cheesecake, placing them in the fridge until I was ready for them, which seemed to soften them up naturally. The brown sugar/flour/butter topping was also a really nice addition that I would recommend. I didn't use a waterbath because the ready made crust would not fit in any of mine, but it ended up perfectly done regardless. Take the time to fan your apples in several layers of circles, and the presentation is phenomenal.
Beautiful, easy and WHOA what a taste!

This is a delicious recipe. My husband loved it. It's best when served fresh, as the apples start top get mushy.

absolutely delicious!  I took the advice of others and doubled the entire cheese filling mixture.  I also baked in a water bath, which I have never done before but was suprisingly easy.  I also cooked for about 70 minutes and kept it in the oven for about an hour and a half to cool.  I also sliced the apples and cut the slices into quarters to avoid hard/tough apples.  An absolute success.  Hint:  if doing a water bath, make absolutely sure that the springform pan in completely water proof.

My first time making cheesecake, and it was a breeze!  I only used two apples, and precooked them in microwave for about 2-3 minutes with the sugar and cinnamon.
I used 3 pkgs of cream cheese, but didn't add any extra eggs.  The crust is delicious, and the cheesecake portion is light and airy.  The apples give it an extra kick!  I arranged them only on the outside rim of the pie, allowing a cool look.  AWESOME!

Fabulous cheesecake.  I have been searching for a 
Fall dessert to bring to a Gourmet Dinner Club party the end of September.  

I tried it last night and it is scrumptuous and will definitely make it for the Club.  I only baked it for 60 mins., next time I'll cook it a little longer as the middle was a bit soft.   I used British Columbia MacIntosh apples.

Sorry, we didn't particularly care for this cheesecake recipe.  The cheesecake part is only average and very thin (I would recommend doubling that portion) and we found the apples to be dry and undercooked.  (I used Granny Smith, cut very thin).  They did, however, moisten up a bit after being refrigerated overnight, although still crunchy and undercooked.  I would, however, give this cheesecake 5 stars for presentation.

I took the advice of others and doubled the cheesecake ingredients, microwaved the apples first, and added more graham cracker crumbles and pecans to the top. I used a water bath and let the cake cool down for almost two hours before putting it into the refrigerator, first in the oven and then on the counter. The only things I would change are to use more cinnamon to give it more of a fall flavor, increase the graham cracker crust by 50% to make it thicker, and cut up less apples - you should only need about three, though I'm not sure how many apples make four cups. Overall, this cheesecake turned out great!

This was a wonderful recipe; the addition of the apple layer makes it really special. This makes for a beautiful Thanksgiving showpiece! I did use reduced fat cream cheese but that didn't affect the taste and we didn't miss the calories or fat!

I cant believe I havent rated/reviewed this recipe yet; considering I have made it 5 times since Nov. It is one of the best I have tried. Those that I allow to taste it say the same thing. I did double the recipe as suggested. And I microwaved the apples prior to putting on top. I also put the cheesecake in a water bath and followed baking directions as written. Thank you Stephanie for this recipe.

I made this for a family Halloween party and everyone requested it again for Thanksgiving. It is so easy and delicious! Thank you Stephanie for making me a cheesecake queen!

I read pretty much all of the reviews before I made this because I had never made cheesecake before and was super nervous. I baked it in a water bath, doubled the cheesecake ingredients, prepared the apple sliced before starting the cheesecake and microwaved them for a minute to remove excess moisture, used all graham crackers for the crust and a little extra butter (I didn't have any pecans on hand), added a streusel topping, baked for 70 minutes and let cool for 45 min with the oven door open and drizzled some caramel on top before serving. It was amazing!!! 

Some tips from my sister for making cheesecake for those who, like I was, are cheesecake making virgins: make sure all of your ingredients for the cheesecake itself are room temperature and mix until completely smooth or it may come out grainy, a water bath/pan with water are important for the cheesecake to stay moist and not crack, make it ahead of time and give it time to set and press the crust firmly into the pan to make sure it stays well.

Delicious and easy to make. Even my boyfriend, who is not a big fan of cheesecakes, loved it. I used neufchatel cheese instead of the cream cheese. Lighter and not too filling either. A keeper for sure.

Loved the apples on top.  I took the advice of others and nuked them first to drain the excess juice; maybe I drained too much, as I thought the resulting cake was a bit too heavy for my taste.  I may do differently next time.

I did think that this was overly exciting.  I think the cheesecake itself may have needed some flavor.  Maybe mix in some of the apples with cinnamon into the cheesecake itself too.  It wasn't bad as is though.  Definitely better the next day.

Wonderful blend of flavors.  I didn't have graham crackers so used a dough based crust with the nuts.  It wasn't as sweet as a graham cracker crust which turned out as a good thing.  I used a peeler,corer, slicer for the apples.

I one and a halved the cheesecake ingredients and added a streusel topping.  Baked for 60-70 minutes, then I let it sit in oven with the oven turned off and the door closed.  After this, I let it cool on the counter until completely cooled.  Then I removed the rim of the pan, and let it chill in the fridge at least 8 hrs.  The streusel topping was a really important element of the finished product.  It would probably be good without it, but it was amazing with it.  My topping didn't burn either, and I put it on before putting the cheesecake in to bake.

Very good recipe! The only change I made was to the crust. I didn't have pecans but rather a mix of pistacho's, pecans and almonds. The recipe was great, very pretty. This would make a nice gift for someone. I will make this again. Thanks.

Great Recipe! I gave it 5 stars thanks to everyones tips. I used 3 packs of cream cheese & only 1 egg. I put a water container below my cake while I cooked it, then let it sit in the oven with the door open for 45 minutes after it was cooked. Lastly, I let if cool in the fridge over night. It is sooooooo good! Thanks everyone! :-)

This was my first ever attempt at making a cheesecake and it was AWESOME.  I am not counting the boxed, no bake kind!  ;)  I am a cheesecake lover and I really did LOVE this!  The filling was so delicious and just the right texture.  I did add an extra package of cream cheese and an egg due to the other reviews of it being 'runny' just to be safe since I was bringing it to my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I just skipped the pecans on top since my hubby is fussy but I did put it it the crust.  Shhh, don't tell!  LOL  He's not allergic or anything!  I am definitely going to make this again!

This cheesecake is DEE-LICIOUS!  My 5 star rating is based on a few reviews that I followed from other people.  I doubled the filling, sliced the apples super thin (about 1/8 inch), and microwaved them to remove some of the juices.  I also made a crumb topping using some flour, brown sugar, and butter cut into the mixture to sprinkle over the cheesecake.  I baked for 70 minutes with a pan of water on the bottom rack, then turned off the oven and allowed the cheesecake to cool for about an hour and a half with the door slightly open :~)

This recipe was delicious. I used 2.5 bars cream cheese and it was perfect. One block was 'low fat' and I was worried about consistency, but it set up as well as full-fat versions. I liked the thick crust and apple topping to cheesecake ratio. It tasted delicious and there was none left at the dinner party! Everyone raved over this one. An absolute keeper. Next time, I will drizzle caramel on the dessert plate before adding a slice.

This recipe is wonderful! I followed the recommendations of previous reviewers (doubling the cream cheese filling, putting a pan of water in the oven, adding a crumb topping, letting it cool in the oven, etc.) and was very pleased with the result. I don't own a springform pan, so I just divided everything into two store-bought graham cracker crusts. I kept the baking time and temp the same and just rotated the two cheesecakes halfway through the cooking time when I pulled them out to add the topping. They turned out great, and everyone at the dinner party really liked them.

I followed all of chibichef's suggestions for baking minus the crockpot liner.  I think the addition of the sour cream was a must.  I've never had a cheesecake quite like this before, but it was delicious.

We were at my daughters in-laws house for Thanksgiving and I prepared it there.  I chose this recipe because I don't like run of the mill dishes.  Also we have organic apples growing on our trees that are probably EXTREEMLY old and only produce every few years.  I doubled EVERYTHING except the baking time.  I don't remember exactly how long it was in the oven but longer than the directions.  It turned out absolutly delish.  Happily it was not consumed because everyone got so filled up with dinner.  I got to share the cake with my daughter and I have the pleasure of seconds and thirds with my husband and a friend.  I used a 9+" springform pan. I'm looking forward to making it again.

Absolutely delicious!  I did not use a water bath and it was fine (I think it having a topping might make it unnecessary).  Also, I used a 7.5" pan and it was still pretty thin so I would definitely try to use a small springform or double the filling.

This is an amazing cheesecake! I'm very particular and cook and bake often but my old recipe of 14 years has just been replaced! This came out p-e-r-f-e-c-t. I only had 2 apples and it was still amazing. The apples cooked exactly as I had hoped, soft but not at all mushy. I used a corer and then sliced them length wise three times. It has just the right amount of sweetness, spice, cheesecake flavor and the apples were a perfect compliment. All the flavors work so well together. Other than being short on apples I didn't change a thing and am so glad I didn't. I personally wouldn't want it any thicker. It looks very professional and wow what a dessert for the holiday. I love this cheesecake!

A lot of people mentioned that they microwaved the apples.  There is absolutely no need to do that.  The problem was probably caused by them not slicing the apples thin enough.  The same problem probably caused others to state that the apples slid around when they sliced the cake.  I used an apple 
corer/slicer and then took each slice and sliced that at least 3 times which made very nice thin slices for the top of the cake without losing any of the juices, and the serrated knife I used to cut the cake cut right through the apples without them moving.  Wonderful presentation.  The only changes I made were to 1. used 1.5 times the cream cheese filling (8 oz addt'l cream cheese and 1 add't egg); 2. used glass pie plate rather than springform pan (didn't have one, and didn't miss it) 3.  put pan of water in oven as suggested by another reviewer and 4. drizzled caramel topping on top when serving.  Delicious, thank you Stephanie.***UPDATE***Made this again and didn't increase the cream cheese filling.  I liked it even more than when I increased it.  This cheesecake is addictive.

This recipe is great, and allows for variations.  There were several changes I made.  I followed the other reviewers suggestion to increase the crust and filling by 1.5.  And instead of topping the cheesecake with the sliced apples, I chopped them up and mixed them right in with the batter.  Rather than topping this with chopped pecans (my boyfriend doesn't like nuts) I topped this with the apple cinnamon glaze from the "Apple Cinnamon Cheesecake by Eagle Brand" recipe on this site.  This was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had!

I needed a recipe for a contest at work and I read the reviews and saw that someone won an at-work baking contest with this recipe.  So I picked it and I also won First Place!  I followed the directions in the reviews:  doubled the cheesecake and crust portions of the recipe, added brown sugar and cinnamon to the apples and microwaved them for 2 minutes, placed about 1/3 of cheesecake mix into pan then added the apples, and then poured the remainder of the cheesecake mix on top.  Then, I added 1/2 stick melted butter and brown sugar to taste to the remainder of the crust ingredients and sprinkled on the top.  It was delicious!

Wonderful!.. BUT READ THE REVIEWS...if you leave the apples on top they will turn to rubber. Pre-saute them and then bury them in a bit of cheesecake. Do not be afraid to substitute some of the white sugar for brown sugar, roughly chop the pecans for better flavor/texture and sprinkle some of the crust on the top.  A little caramel drizzled on top is nice too!

If you took a slice of mediocre cheesecake and served it next to a mediocre slice of apple pie you'd have the equivalent of this dessert.  It seemed like a good idea but just didn't excite me.

This recipe is fantastic. If you like Apple Pie or Cheesecake, you've got to try this recipe! I doubled the filling and the crust, and it was perfect. I sprinkled  1/4 of the crust mixture on top. Fabulous!

My kids wanted to make cheesecake and chose this recipe.  They followed most of the suggestions.  It came out great, it was creamy and not too dense.  They partially cooked the apples in the microwave as suggested but mixed some cinnamon and sugar with the liquid and used it as a sauce.  The crust was just the right amount, not too thick or thin.  They doubled the ingredients for the cheesecake because my smallest springform pan is 10".  We will probably be making this one again.

This is now my famliy's favorite dessert recipe! I've made it for Easter, Thanksgiving, and I've brought it to parties, and everyone has loved it. Even my dad, who doesn't care for cheesecake, asked me to make it again. I don't have the springform pan that the recipe calls for, so I use a nine inch pie plate and it turns out wonderfully. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best cheesecake ever!!!!  I have made it several times and all who try it give it rave reviews.  I made it for Thanksgiving and I am still getting compliments from it.  I definately recommend microwaving the apples first then adding them to the top to bake.  I also recommend adding a carmel drizzle to the top of the cheesecake (before the apples) and then another drizzle after the apples.  To top it off before serving I added more caramel.  What a hit!

I followed all of the suggestions, and doubled the ingredients for the filling, as well as doubled the ingredients for the crust, I can't imagine it without doubling the filling, would be way too thin. While preparing the filling, I put the apples in the oven for 15 mins to soften them. I also diced them instead of sliced, so that this would be easier to cut through. I baked for a total of 80 minutes, then left in oven turned off for 30 more minutes. I heat up the bottom of my springform pan on the stove after it cooled so that I could remove the pan bottom and put on a plate. This turned out great, better than any other cheesecake I've made yet! I made two with apples, and then made a version with crushed oreos mixed into the filling, and then spread on top, instead of apples. Thanks for posting this recipe, 5 stars!!

Simply amazing. A great combination of cheesecake and apple pie. Not to be missed for those who enjoy either. I went with the 1.5 amounts for the cheesecake ingredients, did the hot water bath, added an apple crumb top, and cooked for 70 min. You can't tell if the cheesecake is set because of the apple top, so you just have to believe with the 70 min. I also left it in the oven to cool for an hour. I do recommend using more ingredients for the crust. The amount listed barely covered the bottom and up the sides. Maybe just a little more, and you can discard the rest. 
Enjoy

A wonderful cheesecake!  I usually make cheesecakes for special occasions and have a collection of favorite recipes.  This is about the best.  I doubled the filling, as some suggested, and increased the cooking time to 90 minutes total.  For a topping, I used the crust recipe, but only needed half the amount of ingredients.  The cheesecake was great, even though I forgot to serve the caramel sauce with it.  No one noticed anything missing, and I had numerous requests for the recipe.  I will definitely make this one again!

This was a very easy cheesecake to make. However, I think that users may be misunderstanding the amount of cream cheese to add because when I first read the ingredients, I wasn't sure if it meant 8 oz per package or 8 oz total. I decided to use 16 oz, and I'm glad I did because my cheesecake turned out perfectly - not too runny at all. It also seems that choosing ripe apples and cutting the slices medium thin is good because if it's too thick, it easily sinks into the cheesecake and is too chunky, but if it's too thin, it dries out easier and doesn't have as nice of an apple taste. Any excess cinnamon/sugar mixture was sprinkled over the cheesecake.

I just got back from taking this cheesecake to our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone LOVED it!  I also doubled the cheesecake filling, and after 70 min of baking I left it in the oven for about 30 min, as others suggested.  I didn't do the water bath because I'm a beginner cook, but this recipe was easy, fun, and delicious.  I was asked to make it for a birthday in a few weeks!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a def. keeper.

This was FANTASTIC! Everyone at my dinner group loved it and as I was eating it I couldn't believe that I made something that tasted so good! I doubled the entire recipe, saving 1/2 of the graham cracker mix to add to the top 20 minutes before the end of cooking ( I added 2 t of flour before doing so). I also drizzled caramel on the top as others had suggested. I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving.

This is an incredible cheesecake. My family absolutely loved it. I sometimes add ground pecans to my crust just for additional flavor but it is great as is. I have tried it using the water bath method and without and they both turned out great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Spectacular!  This cheesecake was sweet, but not too rich.  The flavors blended perfectly.  The only thing I'd like to say is you'd better put a drip pan at the bottom of the oven; the juices from the apples tend to run.  I'll definetely be making this again!

I made this Cheesecake over the weekend. It was AMAZING! Everyone loved it. I took previous suggestions to increase cream cheese and microwave apples for a few minutes to ensure they are soft.
I already have had three people request I make this again.
Thanks Stephanie!

This cheesecake is extremely tasty!  I especially like the crust on this one.  And the apple topping does a good job of camouflaging any of those pesky little cracks that sometimes appear.  The only suggestion I would make is to double the cream cheese mixture.  I've just read a few reviews and I have to say, I've made this cheesecake many times and I've used different kinds of apples and never microwaved them and i always drizzle the juice over the top.  The cheesecakes have always turned out great.  If anything the cheesecake is that much more smooth and creamy (but not runny) because of the juice.

I wasn't overly impressed but my guests seemed to have liked it along with my husband (Only 2 pieces left).  I made a total of five different desserts ( Autumn cheescake, chocolate chip cookies, caramel brownies II, Cinnamon Coffee Cake II, and White chocolate blondies (everyones favorite that night)).  The problems I ran into is I didn't know how long to cook it and if it was done.  I ended up cooking it for 70 minutes and then put it in the refridge for the next day.  The middle was still runny when I cut into it the next day.  But the flavor was nice.  I did end up using 1 extra cream cheese, 1 extra egg, 1/4 cup extra sugar, and vanilla.  Plus I did put a layer on top of the crust and also on top of the cream cheese part.  Plus I mixed some in with the cheese cake mixture.  The crust was very easy to do.  I never have made a crust like this.  Don't let that intimidate you from making this it took 2 minutes!!!!  The hardest part was peeling and cutting the apples,  which when it is all done the apples are crisp (if you don't like crisp apples in your cheese cake you may want to cook them before putting them in your cake).  So, very easy to make.  Putting the pan of water in when cooking made it so it didn't crack.  The nice thing about this cheesecake is that it wasn't overly sweet.  For me it was just right in the sweetness area.  Since everyone seemed to like this cheesecake, I would make it again!

I have made alot of cheesecakes but this one was the best.  I changed the recipe a little by adding a layer of apples before (on the crust)and after the filing (on top with the nuts).  It came out great and made my husband's birthday extra special.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake.  It cracked in many places but it tasted soo good that I quickly forgave its appearance.  This was the best cheesecake I ever tasted! Maybe I used a smaller pie pan but I didn't have to double anything, but I did use a little sour cream per other suggestions.  I also mixed in half the apples in with the mix and the rest were placed on top. Placing a pan of water in the oven did keep the cake moist and when it was all said and done, to cover some of the cracks, I melted some carmel and drizzeled over all.  This is the ultimate fall dessert! Thank you Stephanie! This recipe was awesome!

This was a wonderfully different cheesecake. After reading other reviews, I decided to keep the 2 packages of cream cheese but add 2 T. of flour and 1/3 cup of sour cream. I got a lot of compliments.

This was the best cheesecake that I have ever tasted!  It was so easy to make and looked very nice.  I multiplied the filling ingredients by one and a half to get a higher cake and it looked just right.  I shared this cheesecake (I baked 2) with about 14 people and everyone absolutely loved it!  Thank you Stephanie!!

This is sooooo good & easy!  I made mine in the food processor (do not melt butter for crust, just chop) & used Gala apples, which I chopped by hand. I think it's better if made the night before so that's it's really cold.

A huge hit! My boyfriend loves cheesecake, not so much apples. I was nervous as this was my first time making a cheesecake, but he says it's the best he's ever had! After reading the comments and reviews, I doubled the filling ingredients, used a pan of water on the bottom rack, and chopped the apples instead of slicing them. It still looked great and tasted amazing. I'll definitely use this recipe again :-)

Ok, this is a REALLY easy and tasty recipe for cheesecake. I followed the instructions of the highest recommended review almost exactly. I had already bought the ingredients for the recipe before I read it, so added a 1/8c flour instead of doubling everything- which did the trick. It is really good base recipe that can be modified into any flavor desired.

I didn't change the recipe at all except for adding some maple syrup over the top at the end.  I have made it three times and been delighted by the result each time.  And served with crème fraiche....yummm

This recipe never fails me. I've made this too many times to count really. I only change a few things; I prepare the apple topping first to let the apples release some of their juice, I don't use pecans in the crust and I bake it for about 75 mins. I let the cake cool on the counter for about an hour and then it gets refrigerated overnight.

This was wonderful!  Cheesecake was great and the apples and pecans added just the right touch.  I did bake mine on a cookie sheet with a pan of water in the oven to prevent cracking.  It came out perfect!

I thought this cheesecake was so good.  I added 1 more package of cream cheese, another 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 more egg and a smidge more vanilla to the cheesecake, like other reviewers advised and it turned out great.  I didn't pre-cook the apples (but I did slice them thin), I didn't double the crust....I did use a springform pan and then put a pan of water on the rack below.  I didn't have time to let it cool in the oven or even refrigerate, so I think my crust got a little soggy while in it's container, but it was still good and that's on me.  I liked it kinda gooey and room temp.  My hubby liked it better cold.  Def going to try it again....maybe with a crumble topping to make it more of a "dutch apple" cheesecake.  Yum!

Sooooooo good, and I'm not big on apple dishes. Slice the apples very thinly, then you don't have to worry about them not cutting when you're trying for pretty slices.  The crumbly topping is essential!

Not my favorite. Definitely double the filling, as I ended up with about an inch-tall cheesecake when baked in a normal springform pan. The apples got pretty dry on top as well.

Amazing! I loved it. It was not difficult to make. Changed only one thing, I chopped the apples instead of slicing them, but I will slice them next time, I think it will give a better look to the cake. Loved the fact it was not too high, would not suggest adding more cream cheese doubling the ingredients. Have saved it, will make it again for sure.

I made this recipe as is about 3 weeks ago as a test run for Thanksgiving. I didn't make any alterations.  Okay.. I did alter it a tad. I used the granulated Splenda instead of reg. white sugar. It came out beautiful and barely lasted two days.  It was DELICIOUS!!!! I am getting ready to make it again for tomorrow's big Turkey dinner. I do not know what everyone is talking about when they say it was runny.. I did the water bath baking method and it was perfect consistency.  A+++++

I think I've rated this recipe before but it deserves another thumb's up.  I was skeptical of apple + cheesecake but I'm sure glad I gave it a shot.  I always follow a recipe closely for the first time and then do my own thing after that and it was great the first time.  Now, I use an extra brick of cream cheese, extra egg, 1/4 cup extra of sugar to make a larger cake.  I slice my apples thin, chop them up and sprinkle onto the top rather than arrange the slices because I wanted them to cook and not just dry out.  Brown sugar instead of white mixed in with the apples.  Instead of a graham crust I just pat down a layer of ground almonds and pour the batter directly on top.  This makes it gluten-free.  When fall rolls around, this is the cheesecake that I turn to.  Very seasonal and would be great for Thanksgiving.

I made this cheesecake for the first time for Thanksgiving. It was completely gone before I could even get a piece for myself!  I've made it twice since then, and have received rave reviews ever since. It's definitely a favourite in my household, and I'd recommend this recipe to anyone that wants a great cheesecake for the cooler months.

GREAT CHEESECAKE!  It was beautiful too!  According to the guests it was the best one yet.  I did cut the slices thin and layer in circles on the top.  I then brushed it with apple jelly.  I cooked it just as stated in the recipe.  Wonderful!

Very good,  I did bake it in a water bath and took the advice of others and microwaved the apples a little to get some of the liquid out. My only complaint was that I had to cook it abot 30 minutes more than the recipe stated.

Um, sorry but never again.  I am no amateur when it comes to baking/cooking.  I don't mind recipes that are a little labor intensive (thinly slicing 4 cups of apples) but this cheesecake did not turn out right at all.  I knew I should have reconsidered making this for Thanksgiving after seeing all the modifications others had made to the recipe.  Good thing we had other yummy desserts to save the day.  I followed others' tips and even baked it in the water bath but it just came out a soggy ugly mess.  We did try it anyway and the flavor with the cinnamon, apples, and cream cheese was good but the crust was SO mushy. First time something turned out this bad (dessert) for me.

This cheesecake is phenomenal!  My friend and I doubled the filling, used Fuji apples, and used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust.  We were so excited that we even stole a piping hot bite right out of the oven!  This cheesecake is so creamy and not too sweet.  It's perfect!

Fantastic! I followed the many suggestions and used 3 pkgs. of cream cheese rather than 2 and added another egg. I used a 1/3 cup of white sugar and a 1/3 cup of brown sugar for the filling, and it really gave the cake a good flavor.  For the crust, I omitted the pecans altogether and used 1 and 1/2 cups of crushed cinnamon graham crackers. I used 2 tablespoons of white sugar and 1 stick of butter and it was one of the best crusts ever!  I poured some Hershey's caramel topping all over the top after it was done baking. It looked great! Also, if you're looking to make this less fatty, don't be afraid to use fat free cream cheese! I used 1 pkg. regular cream cheese and 2 pkgs. fat free cream cheese and there was no difference in taste! Just be sure to cook a little less longer than you're probably used to- maybe about 5 or 10 min less. Fat free cream cheese cooks a bit faster.

This was outstanding.  I followed the modified recipe (no pecans, doubled the filling, sliced apples thin, microwaved apples for 1 minute and drained, sprinkled it with a mixture of flour/brown sugar/butter and put a pan of water in the oven during the 70 minutes of baking.  I let it sit in the oven with the door open for an hour after baking.  I refrigerated it overnight.  It was amazing and got rave reviews.   Tonight (night 2), I'm going to serve it with a thin drizzle of hot fudge and carmel on top.  Thanks for the recipe, Stephanie, and others who modified.

Normally I make a recipe exactly how its written first, then tweak to my liking.  After reading the reviews, I tweaked first and it came out amazing.  I made the crust exactly as is; perfect.  I increased the ingredients for the filling (3 pkgs cream cheese, 3/4 c sugar, 3 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, and added 1 c sour cream.  I chopped the apples (1/2" cubes) place in a sauce pan, added the white sugar and cinnamon but also added 1/4 c brown sugar and cooked slowly until the apples softened.  I drained the apples and thickened the liquid with a little flour then coated the apples before spooning on top.  This is only my second baked cheesecake, so I opted to use a pan of water beneath and baked at 325 for 1 1/2 hours, cracked the door for 3 hours and it was perfect.  A definite must is wrapping the bottom of the pan with foil!  As others has said, any fruit topping would be awesome.  Great  starting point for many new creations.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I followed NOELC's review and appreciated the distilling of the instructions. I used regular Splenda for the cheesecake and Splenda Brown Sugar for the topping. I did not completely double the Splenda measurement for the cheesecake as it is sometimes sweeter than sugar, but in this case, my husband would have liked it sweeter with the doubled measurement. I used 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of a full cup. This topping was yummy, but I would like to experiment with others. At our serving, there wasn't much left.

I've been looking for this type of recipe for a long time, and I am very happy I found it.  I used this recipe as a base and made some modifications to it.  I used 1.5 times the cheesecake recipe (i.e., 3 packages of cream cheese).  I microwaved the apples for 2 minutes and then layered them on top of the cheesecake.  I then mixed together the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it on top of the apples.  I added a streusel topping to the cheesecake, and I served it with caramel sauce drizzled on top.  It came out great!  I took it to our office lunch, and the whole thing disappeared in no time.  I recommend using green apples; using sweet apples would be sweetness overkill.  Everyone commented that this cheesecake had an appropriate level of sweetness.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was great! Aside from using neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese, I didn't really mess with this. I did follow other reviewers' advice and used one and a half times the ingredients in the cake section (i.e. 3 8oz packs cc, 3/4 c sugar, 3 eggs, and extra vanilla) and also added a simple crumb topping (flour, butter, brown sugar), which I poured on with about ten minutes left of bake time.  It came out really well--the apples were tender and not oversweet, and the crust was perfect--neither too thick nor too thin, too wet nor too dry. I may have undercooked the whole thing slightly, but even the gooey center tasted great.  We also noticed that this improved with time--that is, it was good the first day, but even better the next. (So make it a day ahead of time if you can.)  This is a pretty simple recipe that turns out a wonderful product. I'll definitely make it again.

This was an awesome recipe. I made it on the weekend for a family dinner with a few adjustments. I added a package of white chocolate chips to the batter, used brown sugar with the apples instead of white and drizzled the top after it cooled with caramel sauce. yum oh!

Very easy, very delicious!  Definitely double this recipe UNLESS you prefer smaller portions... nothing wrong with that because it is calorie laden. It was only 2" high and I like the cheesecakes you get at that "factory" so I will double it next time.  The apples make a great presentation and autumn feel. The crust was wonderful with the addition of the pecans, don't omit them, this is what gives it that extra pizzazz.

This was a delicious cheesecake.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because you can use any cheesecake base with the apples. Per the other reviews I used 3 pkg cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar and 2 tsp vanilla.  I also used cinnamon graham crackers as the crust.  I had to bake for an additional 30 minutes and it was hard to tell if the cake was done because the apples covered the top.  But the result was smooth and creamy and the apples made a nice bite. Would definitely make again.

My first attempt at cheesecake at it did not disappoint!  I used lots of suggestions- bowl of water, microwave apples, and diced apples in small pieces. I actually included half of the water from the apples because it had the sugar and cinnamon in it and looked to good to waste.  Turned out great!  I left it in the over for a half hour after it was baked as well.  Quite a bit of work, but worth it.  It's delish!

Wonderful! 

I dumped all the wet ingredients into the mixing bowl and turned on the Kitchenaid to slow. Used an additional block of cream cheese, a cup of sour cream and one more egg. Doubled the vanilla. 

Used a 10 inch springform. No extra crumb mixture. 

Perfect height and about 6 extra servings. 

Wonderful!

Nice cheesecake, but as is we were disappointed that the cheese layer was so small, so next time I will increase the cheese mixture as others had recommended.  I used apples that didn't soften much either, so be careful what kind of apple you choose.  As another reviewer said, drizzle caramel topping on, a little bit of fresh whipped cream and you have perfection!!

this cheesecake is very, very good. I listened to some of the other reviews, like adding another bar of creamcheese, another egg, increased the sugar and O MY GOSH...delicious.What I did do different, was use a 8" springform pan so the cake was thicker, which came out terrific. I up'd the cooking time to 75 min though, with a water bath. Also, added the flour, sugar and butter crumble just to top it iff and make it look pretty....This cake is a HIT!!!!

Well i had to make a few changes. 1. I precooked the apples in...the microwave and squeezed them to get the extra Juice out. 2. I put the apples in the middle of the cake in a layer (like "oreoed" between the cheesecake) 3. I used Ginger Snaps for the crust. 4. I put a caramel pecan topping on AFTER the cheesecake cooled

other than that...it was good

Amazing!  I took this to a friend's barbecue and dessert contest and won!  I made more of the graham cracker crust and used it as a topping (mixed with brown sugar and some softened butter) as suggested by a previous reviewer, as well as doubling the cheesecake ingredients.  I waited until the last minute to make this, so I didn't get to chill it as long as I would have liked to, but even then, it was still excellent! Easy recipe.

I'm afraid that I was disappointed with this cheesecake.  It didn't hold a candle to to Toffee Chunk cheesecake made last week.  I didn't find a "big" apple taste, the crust was stiff and difficult to cut through, and the apples on top looked withered by the time the cheesecake was finished baking.

Beautiful Recipe... yum! I also cooked the apples a little in the microwave to get them soft. Should have read the reviews a bit more though, definately should have doubled the cheesecake filling as there wasn't enough of that creamy taste. But still delicous enough for my family to gobble it up without even waiting for plates!

This cheesecake is wonderful. The filling is very creamy. I always drizzle some caramel ice cream topping over the top of the apples after it comes out of the oven, which adds a little something more to the flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent cheesecake and very easy to make.
My changes:
1. Doubled the ingredients for the filling.
2. Doubled the crust and used a little less than half for a crumb topping.  (I put some crumb topping on top when it initially went in the oven and then when there were 10-15 minutes left I added the rest.)
3. Microwaved the apples to remove the excess juice.

Delicious!!!  As recommended, I doubled the cheese part, microwaved the apples before placing them on the cake, and added a pan of water to the oven.  I think I would do 1.5x the amount of cheese next time...  I also skipped the nuts in the crust because I was running low and it was fine.  I used my food processor for the crust & cheese.  It also looked beautiful after nicely layering the apples on top.

This is the best cheesecake I've made so far! I sliced the apples thinly and arranged in a spiral pattern on top of the cheese mixture and then I put whole pecans scattered ontop. Just before serving, I drizzled warm caramel sauce ontop.  I served it at a dinner party last night and everyone wanted the recipe.

Excellent - looks like something from the bakery.  I used an extra block of cream cheese, 1 more egg and 1/4 cup of sugar on top of the origional recipe.  Turned out perfect.  I didn't have to cook the apples before putting on the cake like others suggested.  I just cut them extra thin - used Granny Smith apples and drizzled with caramel sauce once it had cooled.

I also doubled the batter recipe which worked out well.  I also added a brown sugar, flour and quick oat topping to the top when I baked it and then drizzled carmel on it.

This is an absolutely wonderful cheese cake.  I did make a couple of changes. I doubled the cream cheese filling ingredients, and added some nutmeg.

This cheesecake was delicious! I had this at a restaurant in my area and I decided I wanted to try and make it. I followed the recipe except for I added a crumb topping(flour, butter,brown sugar and chopped pecans) about 20 minutes before it was done. All my friends loved it and said it tasted just like the one at the restaurant. I did notice it was not as thick as I would have liked so next time I will double recipe.

Excellent! Like a cross between cheesecake and apple pie.  I didn't have pecans on hand, so I just added a little more graham cracker crumbs for the crust & it still turned out great.  I also didn't have a springform pan, and a regular pie pan worked just fine.

Absolutely wonderful! I have never made a cheesecake before. My husband couldn't believe that I made it. The only thing I did differently was use a pre-made shell. I had one on hand. I will definitely make again and again. Very easy.

I make 1/2 serving of the cake by using a 7" round mould.  I follow exactly the ingredient and direction which results in a nice cheesecake.  I will increse the nut topping next time because it is so yummy! Just one thing, the apple flavor is not strong enough to make the cheesecake outstanding! Still I like the cake, thx!

This cheesecake is unbelievably good - it's beautiful and delicious, looks like it came out of a southern living catalog. I've made it twice and had requests for the recipes. Definite keeper, thanks! BTW - it took me less than 4 apples to get 4 cups of sliced apples, even finely sliced.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving as a nice gesture for coworkers. I was a little bit nervous, but the faces of pure bliss quickly reassured me.  You know you have a good cheesecake when someone can't form words, just "mmmmmmm"!

Excellent cheesecake.  The first time I made it I thought the apples would be in the cheesecake, so when it was finished and they were on top, I was a little worried, but after the many many requests for the recipe my worries were gone.

This was FANTASTIC!!  Great for fall and would make a great Christmas season desert as well.  I made it as 1 1/2 recipe in the 9" springform pan and used light cream cheese for a lower fat version.  I will definitely be keeping this one!

Scrumptious cheesecake!  I had to make it in a 10 inch pan, so I added 1 pkg cream cheese, 1 egg, 1/4 c. sugar, and a little more vanilla.  The cheesecake still turned out a little thin, but tasted wonderful!  I didn't want the apples mushy or crunchy, so I nuked them for just 1 minute before arranging them in circles on the cake.  (I used Gala apples, great choice).  With a drizzle of caramel syrup on the plate and on top of the cheesecake, it was a stunning presentation and a great hit!

Wow!  Yummy!  I used 1 1/2 of the filling, and it turned out perfect..I think if it was doubled, it may not fit into the springform pan with the apples.  I also cooked for about 80 minutes then turned the oven off, and let it sit in there for another 30 minutes.  Everyone loved this.  I made it for Thanksgiving dessert.

This was an okay cheescake next time I will double the creamcheese filling this was more like a cream cheese pie with sugared apples on top.  I do suggest adding the pecans after it has cooked.

This is a great and simple recipe.  I use it whenever I want to impress guests.  I've never had a guest turn down a second helping.  For quick serving, I just let it cool about 10 minutes then stick it in the freezer while dinner is served.  It is usually chilled to a good temperature by the time dessert needs to be served.

Really delicious dessert...best of both worlds (apple pie and cheesecake).  Everyone loved it.  I made it as a traditional American dessert for Memorial Day, but I'm sure I'll try it for other holidays!

The apple layer is really tangy and goes well with the creamy cheesecake.

I just needed to add approx. 2 Tbsp. of extra melted butter to the crust mixture as it was a little too dry/crumbly.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good cheesecake, especially if you're desiring a different kind of cheesecake.  I took the tip of drizzling warm carmel sauce over the top when I served it - Great tip!  It was a hit!

I made this for dinner guests, and it was a hit - even the one non-cheesecake eater in the group said he liked it.  I added the extra cream cheese, etc. as suggested, but it took about two hours in the oven before it set.  Next time I would add more cinnamon.

This recipe in a word is great!  I even impressed my 84 year old grandmother, who has been cooking her whole life.  I would consider myself an amateur cook (male, 23), yet after trying this cheesecake, people think I've been making it for years.  I usually follow the directions to a T, except for the amount of pecans I put on top of the apples.  I urge anyone to try this fantastic cheesecake for the holidays.

This the best cheesecake I have ever made. I cook several times a week for co-workers and gage how well liked by how long after morning break there is any left. This was gone before morning break. Excellent, Excellent!

Excellent cheesecake.  I've made many apple cheescakes and this was one of the best.  I used golden delicious apples so it wouldn't be so crunchy and doubled the filling, but kept everything else as the recipe states.  Don't overcook it or the cheesecake will be somewhat dry. Next time I will put a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake as I usually do. It keeps it nice and moist and prevents it from drying out. Very beautiful presentation with a delicious taste.  I will certainly make it again.  It was a big hit at home and at my office.

This cheesecake was excellent.  Very easy compared to other cheesecake recipes.  Followed Lothrid suggestion to double the cheese filling, also topped with caramel syrup.  The apples were a little crunchy for us.  Will try precooking a little next time.

This cheesecake is wonderful.  The filling is a bit thin so I doubled the cream cheese, eggs, and vanilla.  I swirled in some caramel sauce and it was even yummier.  Excellent!!

This is the BEST cheesecake I have ever had!! Everyone who has tried it loved it. I had never made a cheesecake before, and couldn't believe how easy it was and how delicious the result was. This will be at the top of my list anytime I have to bring a desert to any gathering!Absolutely wonderful!

Who can resist not trying this recipe seeing the number of reviews and ratings it attracted.  I made this and bought it to a birthday party where there was other birthday cake, I could tell that my cake attracted more attention than the other shop-bought cake.  Firstly, because of the impressive outlook and mostly, the great taste!  
Thanks Stephanie for sharing!!

I have made this recipe three times now. My husband says it is the best cheesecake he has ever had. It doesn't take long to throw together, and it is an impressive dessert for company. This one's a keeper.

Absolutely, by far, the best cheesecake ever.  I invited friends over for dinner the other night, and they sheepishly asked if they could "request" the dessert menu - which happened to be this recipe!!  They loved it so much the first time I made it, they asked if I would make it for them again!  An absolute winner - bar none.  A+++

This is, without a doubt, the BEST cheesecake ever configured!!!  I found that a caramel drizzel just before cooling adds a terrific touch.

I found this to be a very tasty cheesecake. I have made it a number of times, my whole family loves it.  It is one of the simplest recipes for cheesecake I have. When I made it the last time I used almonds instead of pecans ( I didn't have any pecans on hand) and 3 macintosh apples along with one granny smith apple ( all I had), I also put in a pan with water.  I cooked it the time on the recipe, it turned out very smooth, creamy, and soft.
Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Absolutely a fabulous recipe!  I made this for a co-workers birthday and everyone is asking for the recipe!
I baked for minimum time suggested and turned out great.  I also bought some caramel ice cream topping to drizzle over the top...made for a nice touch.  I used a mix of Granny Smiths and McIntoshes and they were delicious!  I love the way the apples keep their crunch!

This was very good.  I baked it for the minimum time suggested, and it was quite gooey in the middle.  Next time I will bake it for a longer time.  I also had the problem of the bottom crust sticking to the pan. Any suggestions? I will play around with this recipie, but very very good!

This is a delicious cheesecake with the best of both worlds (apple pie and cheesecake)!  My husband (and everyone else) can't get enough of it, when I make it!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It's simple to make too.  I usually use a premade crust.

love love LOVE this cheesecake. Def double the cheesecake ingredients and don't be afraid to add extra cinnamon to the graham cracker crust. I used cinnamon graham crackers & added extra cinnamon and heard nothing but compliments!! Also, I did not throw extra pecans on the top of the apples. Microwaving the apples for 2 min prior to adding the sugar & cinnamon helped them become more tender on the cake. My mom requested me to make this for her bday and said this is her favorite cake. Because of this cake, my uncle suggested I open up my own bakery.

Delicious & easy!  I've made this cheesecake three times in the past two weeks.  Twice I followed the recipe as originally posted by Stephanie and the results were wonderful. The third time the ingredients were doubled as several reviewers suggested and baked in a 10" pan rather than the 9" pan.  The cake was still good but I prefer the smaller pan with the original amount of ingredients.  I placed a pan of water on the lower shelf during baking. I didn't microwave the apples (Gala) beforehand and all went well.  Now I'm curious about other toppings, such as blueberries.

I tried this recipe with the suggestions (more cream cheese, microwave the apples, flour-brown sugar topping, and pan of water in the oven), and it turned out well. Only difference was that I doubled the recipe (for as crowd) and used a  13x20 pan. It was delicious! And it was my first time making cheesecake.

Made this last night for my son's birthday.  What a nice autumn dessert!  I went with Cindy's suggestions and added 1 extra cream cheese, 1 extra egg, 2 t. of vanilla and 3/4 c. sour cream.  Baked it (water bath) a bit longer to 165-degrees and left it in the oven (door shut) for 1 extra hour.  Chilled over night. So good, and creamy.  I did the trick with the apples in the microwave, but really don't think it was necessary as not much fluid came from them.  I guess it would depend on the type of apples used, I used 3 Jonagolds.  I'm probably done with the water bath method as no matter what precautions I take, water seeps in.  I have a nice springform pan and it was wrapped twice with heavy duty foil!  I'm lucky the crust wasn't totally ruined.  From now on, I will place a pan of water under the cheesecake...it's not worth ruining expensive ingredients.

I think this recipe is perfect as is, which is how I tried it today except I made only half a recipe for my husband and me.

I used a Baker's Secret square pan which is either 8 x 8" or 9 x 9". Since this is a dark colored pan, I set the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

I used slightly less than 2 large Pink Lady apples which I think are in season now.  They are tart and firm so I thought they were good for this recipe. Probably any tart apples would be good. After peeling, I cut them into quarters and removed the seeds. I used the blade on my Cuisinart food processor that results in thin slices.

I did use a "water bath".  I heated water and poured it into a glass 13 x 9 x 2" baking dish. Then, I placed the square pan with the cheesecake mixture in the water, making sure the water level was about half way up the outside of the square pan.

The baking time was 1 hour.  I first let the cheesecake cool by setting it on the table before covering it and refrigerating it.

This Autumn Cheesecake is delicious.....a definite "do again".  I feel good about making a full recipe for company or to bring to an occasion.

I enjoy cooking and baking and have been doing so for over 40 years!

Just a few changes makes this the best cheesecake recipe ever. Double the filling. Add a bit of lemon juice or a couple of pinches of salt to the filling- it can be a bit bland. Cook for 75-80 minutes at 350 and let sit in the oven with the heat off for another 15 minutes. I've made a crumb topping, as others have suggested, and microwaved the apples, as others have said. Ultimately I've decided I like it better just as the recipe calls for- thinly sliced apples dredged in the cinnamon-sugar mix and arranged as the picture shows. Definitely drizzle some caramel topping on top right when you take it out of the oven. I don't even know how to go about using a water bath so I just have a pan of water on the rack below and figure that's good enough. This is a top notch recipe.

First of all I have to say that this cheesecake made my home smell heavenly.  I did what another member said and microwaved the apples to make them tender and that made them easy to cut through after baking.  I have made things with apples before and was disappointed at how crisp they still were.  This cheesecake was so easy to make and it tasted as good as it smelled.  I think next time I might glaze my pecans or add a little caramel to make it caramel apple.  It's a pretty versatile recipe.

This was my first time ever making a cheesecake. I made it as the recipe states, and it was amazing!  I wouldn't change a thing!  It was perfect at 60 min, any longer and it would have started to burn.  I didn't pre-cook the apples, or double the filling, or bake in a water bath.  My apples were not dry.  Nothing was soggy.  I used 3 Fuji apples cut into moderately thin slices.  Everything was perfect!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you Stephanie for submitting the recipe!

This is absolutely delicious!  I followed previous reviewers' advice and doubled the cheese filling.  It took about 75 minutes t bake, but it was well worth the wait.  So wonderful!

I read a lot of issues regarding burnt crust..maybe they should have moved it to a higher rack or turned the temp down (every recipe will have an oven temp BUT one should really knoww their oven and what works best for them). If i left mine in longer my crust would have burned (could taste it a little), now I know for next time! I also will chop the apples because they made it very difficult to slice the cake. Anyhoo.....This was AMAZING and I will continue to make it over and over and over!

The crust is perfect as is. Like other reviewers, I doubled the cheesecake part and it worked out perfectly. I did lower the heat to 325 and I let it sit in the cooling oven for 20 minutes after the cooking time ended. The key is to slice the apples really thinly so they cook all the way through. I also used a water bath. This is a good recipe but it helps to have some experience making cheesecake. I think the cooking time and temp would have been far too much for the ingredients as scaled.

This is the absolutely the best cheesecake!!!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone said that I better make it for Christmas, and I did.  I have made other cheesecakes and this one is the best.  I was told that I have to make it every year.  We have a big crowd and there was only one small sliver left and I ate that the next day.

I entered this cheesecake in a contest at work & WON 1st place!! This cheesecake was AMAZING, the best I EVER had. I did put my own twist on it, by making it Gluten Free, soaking the apples in lemon water (so they wouldn't turn brown so fast) & added 8oz of Mascrapone Cheese.

As suggested, I added an extra 1 pkg cream cheese, 1 egg, 1/4 c sugar, and 1/4 tsp vanilla to make the filling thicker. I also drizzled carmel sauce over the top after it came out of the over. I brought this into work and everyone was was amazed that it was homemade! Absolutely delicious!

Delicious!!! The most recent time I made it, I diced the apples instead of slicing them. It made the cake so much easier to cut!! I also micro the apples until they let go of some moisture, then put a layer mid-cake and the other half apples on top. This was the favourite dish at Thanksgiving this year.

I made this cheesecake for dessert for our Thanksgiving meal.  It was so easy to do and the results were absolutely amazing!  It was light and sweet, but not too sweet!  The only modification I made was to add mostly brown sugar to the apples instead of white sugar.  I think next time, I may try and double the cheese filling part.  A definite add to the "do again" recipes!!

I took the advice of the previous rating by NoelC. I doubled the cheesecake ingredients, microwaved the apples, added a crumb topping and baked with pan of water underneath. FABULOUS!!!! Best cheesecake ever! I drizzled with Carmel sauce before serving. Yummy!

I made the mistake of baking this in a glass dish, rather than a spring form pan, and the crust became slightly burnt and stuck to the pan.  I made the cheesecake exactly as the recipe called for, but added the pecans toward the end so they didn't burn.  It still tasted phenomenal even with the less than stellar presentation.  This was a very welcome change from the usual apple pies and crisps served in the fall.

This was really delicious, and very pretty, too! I added an extra 8 oz cream cheese (ended up using two regular, one low-fat) and instead of sprinkling pecans on top I did a streusel with white sugar, cinnamon, flour and butter.  I baked it for 70 minutes in a water bath, then shut the oven off and let it sit for another hour or so.  Great flavor and texture.  I'll definitely make this one again!

We loves this! I used almonds. Next time won't slice apples quite so thin, fell apart a little from microwaving. made a little extra filling and sprinkled on top. Baked with a pan of water on the lower rack. I personaly give it a 5, but not my Beloved. It looked beautiful!! I would serve it to guest with no regrets.

Just spectacular for this time of year!!!  I made this for a swim team spaghetti feed and we had to slice it pretty thin for everyone to get some.  It was one of the best I have had.  I doubled the filling, but kept the crust and apple part the same. I used 1 fuji and 1 granny smith apple.  They crust is wonderful - buttery, and nutty.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe handy!

This cheesecake is delicious!!!  Like others mentioned, I doubled the recipe for the filling.  Otherwise it would've looked too small.  I also threw the chopped apples in the microwave for about a minute or two to get rid of some of the liquid.

I've had this recipe saved in my box for 3 years now and finally made it for Thanksgiving this year.  Overall it was good and my family enjoyed it, but not enough to make again. I thought the apple/cheesecake combo wasn't the best... I guess I'm more of a purist when it comes to cheesecake.

This recipe was easy, and I hardly ever bake!  I did put a pan of water on the bottom rack, but I didn't double the ingredients, and I didn't have any problems.

Almost perfect... just a little tweaking!  I did double the cheesecake ingredients, and I'm so glad I did.  One thing I didn't care for was the crust... for some reason it tasted a bit burned, so maybe next time I won't precook it.  I also didn't care for the nuts in it; next time I'll just make a regular graham crust.  I did microwave the apples to soften-- they turned out perfect.  I'd highly recommend topping the apples with a crumb topping... I used the recipe for the topping on "Apple Crisp II" and sprinkled the pecans on top... it was AWESOME!

I followed most of the recipe as written. I doubled the cheesecake mixture. I also microwaved the apples for 2 minutes to get rid of some of the moisture. I put a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake in the oven. Mine baked for 70 minutes and cooled in the oven with the door open for 45 minutes. I also used walnuts instead of pecans because I didn't have any pecans. Everyone loved it and I have been asked to make another one.

I really liked this cheesecake,when I told people what I was making,it was like 'what? apple cheesecake? never heard of that' well,now,they have and it's a winner! I love it! I have just been told next time to make it with the apples folded in the cheese. Might be fun to try that way.

I have now made this five times and it always is a hit. I get asked for the recipe all the time.  I make a caramel sauce to drizzle over the slices before serving. It is so yummy Thank you for the awesome cheesecake recipe.

This was great!  I did what I read a few other reviewers did. I microwaved the apples for 2 minutes. I think I could have even did it one more minute.  I acutally made the cheese cake mixture  into a recipe and a half-- using 3-8 oz creams and 1 1/2 timzed the other items too in the cheesecake batter.  I put a small cake pan half full of water on the shelf below the cheesecake in the oven during baking. I baked the cheesecake for 70 minutes, shut the oven off and didn't open the oven for another 1 1/2 hours while it cooled. It disappeared FAST! My family and company wished there was more. Wonderful!

Made this for Christmas, and it was a huge hit. It was the best of both world's - apple pie and cheesecake - all in one dessert. Made it exactly as directed except for adding a little dried tapioca to the apples to absorb any extra moisture. Didn't even bother with a water bath, since the apples on top seemed to keep the cheesecake from drying out and cracking. Very yummy.

YUM!  I used a crumble topping (oats, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon) like you would put on a crisp to add to the esthetic appeal and keep the apples from drying out too much - DELICIOUS!  A new favourite cheesecake (from somebody who rarely strays from chocolate!)

Oh My gosh! That was an incredible cheesecake! I served it at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I did double the cheesecake ingredients like one of the other reviewer did, and also precooked the apples in the microwave and added flour to them with the spices. It was just the right texture and combination of cheesecake and apples are great! This is a do over and over again!

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving but thankfully I tried this out before I made it for my whole family. I took the advice of others by making twice the amount of filling, water bath, 70 minute cook time, and let it cool in the oven with the door open for 45 minutes to an hour. I also used a mandolin to slice the apples and then cut them into thin julienne slices. I chose this cutting technique because arranging the slice apples resulted in difficult cutting of small pieces (acceptable size for this rich cheesecake).

I hate to do this, especially to a recipe that so many other people enjoyed, but mine didn't turn out well.  I made it for Thaknsgiving and it was hardly touched.  The crust burned, the filling had an unusual texture, and there were too many apples so they didn't cook through.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  I've made lots of cheesecakes and I was a little unsure about the ingredients for the filling, they seemed lacking, but I trusted the recipe.  I'm sorry but I was really disappointed and will not be making this again or recommending it.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! A big hit at Thanksgiving!  I did these modifications: 3 packages of cream cheese, extra 1/4 cup of sugar and an extra egg in the cheese layer, I diced the apples and put them in the microwave for 1 minute to remove excess moisture, and I baked it for 70 - 75 minutes in an oven that had a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake.  I also added a little cinnamon to the cheese layer.  I did not think this recipe was very hard, and the results are delicious, so it is worth the prep time.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and got many compliments.  Like others said, I also added another cream cheese, egg, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I also used cinnamon graham crackers.  The flavor was good, but this is what I will do next time: either I will double the cream cheese or use another cheesecake recipe to get a nice tall cheesecake.  Also I will partially cook the apples in the microwave as suggested because the apples, which I sliced very thin, were somewhat rubbery. I'm going to try again because the combination is nice and the flavor & presentation are great for the fall.

OMG, So good! This is going to make me look great at Thanksgiving. I added the extra egg, package of cream cheese, and 1/4 cup sugar as suggested. I also did the water bath and microwaved the apples. Make sure to cook the crust before putting in the filling, I forgot on one and it was a little mushy. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent:)

I used the Chantal's NY Cheesecake recipe and spread apple filling on top of graham crust and added apples to cream cheese mix. I placed apples on top as well. I sprinkled walnuts on top and drizzled caramel right before serving. Everyone loved it!

This was my first attempt at making real cheesecake and it was a HIT! I followed the recipe to a "T" except that I added a streusel topping (1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup cold butter).  When making it again I will NOT pre-cook the crust for 10 minutes like the recipe says b/c I felt that the crust was overcooked, especially since the cheesecake's in the oven for 70 minutes! I did not pre-cook the apples in the microwave as others suggested -- just make sure you cut the apples THIN and you'll be fine.  ENJOY :)

WOW!  I took this to a chili cook off, and it didn't last 5 minutes. As others recommend, most definitely double the recipe!  I found slicing the apples paper thin made it completely unnecessary to cook the apples beforehand.  I used a combination of honey crisp and regent apples.  I topped it off with a moderate drizzle of homemade caramel sauce!  Out of this world!  thanks for sharing!

I'm not a very good baker but this cheesecake turned out fantastic!  Even people who don't like cheesecake were coming back for seconds.  I followed the other reviewer's suggestions and used 3 packages of cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, 3 eggs, and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract for the cheesecake filling and it was perfect.  I used McIntosh apples and microwaved them before adding them to the top of the cake.  Can't wait to make this again, thanks for the awesome recipe.

Double the cheesecake filling.  Microwave the apples with the cinnamon and sugar for 1 minute before adding to the cheesecake.  Bake for 75-80 minutes.  Put a pan of water on the lowest rack while backing.  Run knife around edge of pan after baking.  Let cool in oven for at least an hour, occasionally running a knife around the pan.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake.  The recipe was easy to follow and the end result was awesome!  I did follow the modifications of other reviewers; cooking with a pan of water below, and increasing the amount of cheesecake filling.  If anyone else is anxious about making a cheeseake for the first time I say go for it, this one is great!

It does taste great but the apples on top seem very chewy, so much that it's hard to eat them.  Next time I think I'll bake them in the cheesecake or maybe chop them up a little kind like applesauce and use that mixed with the other ingredients on top.

This was the cheesecake that started it all.  I baked this cheesecake about 5 years ago and when I got all the rave reviews, I continued baking and experimenting and now I'm a semi-professional baker...and I owe it all to this cake!!!

I made this twice in a week!  Even though it is summertime, it is a cool dessert that my whole family loved!  I'm not big on nuts, but I followed the recipe to the "T" and the pecans made it what it was! WONDERFUL!

I must have / make about 20 different kinds of Cheesecake, and I love them all, but this one is my favorite.  I call it Apple-Pecan-Crumb Cheesecake, because I add a Crumb topping to it (like crumb cake)  YUMMY!!  This cake is WONDERFUL!  Thanks for the Recipe!

This cheesecake had a wonderful balance to it. The topping to filling to crust ratio was perfect and it was not too rich, but  a medley of explosive yummy (c: My husband never asks for seconds on cheesecake but on this particular recipe he could not get enough of. I used pink lady apples for the topping and added a little more cinnamon than what was called for to coat the apple slices. This is a great recipe year round and wonderful served extra cold on a warm summer day.

I have used this recipe so many times, and it is wonderful every time.  I do not use as many apples as the recipe calls for because they just don't fit.  I cut the apples a lot smaller so that the cheesecake is easier to cut after baking, and I use the microwave trick that some other reviewers used.  With all this, the cheesecake always comes out.

I didn't find that I needed the extra ingredients as others had suggested, it was just fine without them.  Although I didn't think the apples blended well with the cheesecake.  Maybe it was because I used granny smith apples.  I didn't find it to be a good combination.  I'll probably try it again and use a sweeter apple next time.

Great recipie! I followed all the tips given. I heated the apples for 2 mins before mixing them with the spices. I used granny smiths and if you let them sit for a bit, you get a lot of liquids. Instead of discarding the liquid I added maybe 2 tablespoons of flour and heated it in the mircowave, this will give you a nice sauce (amount of flour depends on how think you want the sauce and how much liquid you have).

Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it, was a huge hit. 

Followed all the tips given on Dec. 29, 2005 by NOELC. I stuck the apples inside the cheesecake, so the top came out smooth and I drizzled top with caramel and chocolate. 

Officially in my Favorite cheesecake files. :)

Very easy to make and looks and tastes delicious. My father said it was even better as leftovers the next day. I made 1 1/2 times the crust and cheesecake batter. I cut the apples into small chunks instead of slices. Used the extra crust as struesel on top. Fabulous!

AWESOME!  This was my first cheesecake so I was a bit nervous, but it turned out great!  I followed the advice of noelc for the most part.  I doubled the cheesecake filling, baked for 70 min, and used a pan with water underneath. I took their advice with the toppings, but in an effort to simplify... I combined the dough and apples.  I spread across the top after the first 40 min of baking.  BEAUTIFUL! I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again!

I microwaved the apples to get rid of some of the juice which turned the apples into applesauce. They looked ugly so I made a crumb and almond topping to go over them and crisscrossed that with caramel after it came out of the oven. I didn't try any of this since I made it for a banquet but people said it was delicious.

As recommended by other reviewers, I doubled the cheesecake mix and the crust. Then  sprinkled half the crust over the apples before baking. The result was the best dessert I've ever made. Even a very finicky boyfriend whole-heartedly approved!

Definitely microwave the apples beforehand and increase the cream cheese to 3 or 4 blocks (and increase the eggs accordingly).

This is a very good and simple recipe. I made the extra topping for the apples. I also baked it in a water bath. One suggestion I have is to make some type of foil packet or buy commercial foil to cover the bottom of the cheesecake pan. My foil wasn't a whole piece and my crust was a little water logged.

Ive always wanted to make a cheesecake, but have never been confident enough! However, anyone can make this recipe. Preparing the apples is the most time consuming part of the recipe. I did follow the advice of another review and added one extra block of cream cheese, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 c sugar for the cheesecake mixture. I also doubled the crust and used the remaining half for the topping on the cheesecake. I put this on about 20 min before it was ready. If you are adding one more block of cream cheese it will take about 25-30 min more in cook time than what it says for original recipe. My mom never asks me for recipes, but she cant wait to get this one from me!

This was sooooooo good! Everyone in my office loved it.  It was pretty easy, too.  The cheesecake part was only about one inch thick, though, so if you like higher cheesecakes you may want to double that part.  Thanks!!

excellent cheesecake-but i made it in an 8" springform pan and omitted the nuts(in the crust i just added an extra 1/2c. of graham crackers). my boyfriend loves a real baked cheesecake and thinks this is the best that he ever had. this would be awesome as a plain cheesecake by just omitting the cinnamon, apples & nuts--you could just use your favorite pie filling added to it if you wanted fruit!!

This is the first cheesecake I've made from scratch and it was the best. This cheesecake wasn't very sweet which made it very good and got lots of compliments from it. I also drizzeled a little carmal ice cream topping over it before serving which made it taste even better,

This was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!  I made it for the teacher appreciation luncheon today at my kids' school and it was gone almost instantly.  I can't wait to make another one.  I also drizzled caramel sauce over the top and had extra in a nice dish for anyone who wanted more.  A definite keeper...thanks!

My cheesecake-lover friend loves this! I halved the recipe and used a ready-made crust. Also added less than a quarter cup flour to the apple mixture. Delicious!

An awesome recipe!  So easy to make and the result is excellent.  I only had 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese so added sour cream and there was not a complaint!  Will definitely add this to my recipe book!

Very good cheesecake.  The only thing I did diffently was use chopped pecans instead of finely chopped pecans for the crust because I couldn't find them.  The crust was perfect, not hard like some of the other reviewers mentioned.  Also, I accidently used 1/2 cup chopped pecans on top instead of 1/4 cup.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent cheesecake and everyone loved it at a "girls night out" movie night I had at my home recently.  I could just eat that crust by itself,it is so good.  Comments were "Worth waiting for" and "To die for." Everyone wanted the recipe!   I used a glass pie pan and didnt have to use quite all the cream cheese filling and I used the chopped pecans for the topping, and ground them finer in a food processor for the crust. Wonderful recipe!  Thank you!

A friend of mine made this once and I fell in love with it... I've made it myself a few times and there never seems to be enough to go around! Thanks for a great recipe Stephanie! (Good idea to use a water bath in the oven, as others have mentioned, so that the cheesecake bakes evenly)

Highly recommend.  Made it for Father's day dinner and it was even loved by the "I-don't-really-like-cheesecake" people.  My first time making a homemade crust and it turned out great.  I followed the recommendations to microwave the apples a bit, using a pan of water in the oven and letting cool for 45 min in an open oven.  Also, don't be afraid to do 1 1/2 or double cheescake filling.  Instead of plopping the apples on top, I overlapped them in a circular pattern on the edge spiralling towards the middle.  It looked fantastic.

This was good, but I don't see the big deal, it wasn't extraordinally.  I did however followed some reviews by upping the cheese and nuking the apples but I think it would've been better if I just left the apples on the pie to cook instead because I did not detect any apple flavoring in the cheese part, only the apple part.  And if you are using tart apples (i.e. granny smith) do use more sugar, my apples still were quite tart.  Maybe next time, I'll just follow the recipe as is or nuke the apples and then combine the apple juices with the cheese mixture so I get more of an apple flavor.

I don't like cheesecake, but my daughter wanted to try to bake one and I picked this recipe.  I'll have to re-evaluate my cheesecake stance.  It was certainly fluffier than the dense cheesecakes I didn't care for.  We added juice of one lemon to the apple slices to prevent browning while we did other preparation, then just decided to keep it in for the bake.  I think it added a great tartness since we used sweet apples instead of Granny Smith types.

I was a little apprehensive about adding the apple topping to bake along with the cheesecake but it turned out really well.  It added a great flavor to the cheesecake.  My two concerns: The top of the cheesecake cracked.  Second, it was not enough mixture so I added another 8 oz of cream cheese, an additional egg and another teaspoon of vanilla and allowed the cheesecake to remain in the oven after I turned the oven off.  I will probably make this again once I figure out how to prevent cracking!

I've made this 3 times now.  Once I took someone's advice and added one extra cream cheese and egg.  The last time I made it I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and it was great!  Anyway you make it-its a hit.

I LOVE this recipe!  If you are an apple & cheesecake lover, then don't hesitate to make this, it is awesome!  I cut up my apples into small pieces.  Also, instead of chopping up the pecans, I shredded them using a cheese shredder.  I didn't use more than a few pecans but it was still awesome.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe Stephanie!

I usually stick to the plain 'ol cheesecake but I will make this one again!!!  I did double the entire filling recipe and added a couple extra shakes of cinnamon to the crust and the apples.  I microwaved the Granny Smiths for 4 minutes on power level 6 to soften them up and drained the juice before I put them on top of the filling.  I did not use the water wash since I thought the apples would keep the moisture in well enough.  I also added the pecans to the top with about 20 minutes remaining of the 65 minute bake time.  I was also making Blondies the same night so instead of leaving the cheesecake in the oven after the initial baking time, I wrapped the whole pan in aluminum foil - put in the fridge overnight and viola!  It was a HIT at my PartyLite Party!!  I won't change a thing the next time I make it (probably for Thanksgiving!)

THANK YOU FOR OPENING MY EYES TO THE ELEGANT CHEESECAKE WORLD!!  : )

I got RAVE reviews for this one from family, friends and co-workers.  This recipe 
is quick to make (except the apple prep) and tastes AMAZING!  This will stay in 
my recipe box!  I plan on making it again soon.  Stick to the shorter end of 
the baking time or the crust gets too dark.  The longer you leave this in the 
fridge, the better it tastes!

This cheesecake was absolutely amazing. I was a little nervous when it came out of the oven with what looked to be a runny center, but I stuck it back in the oven for about 10 minutes and it was still like that, so I just let it cool down and stuck it in the fridge and it turned out fine. I got completely praised for it. I had people saying they can't believe it wasn't in a restaurant somewhere. It made me feel like a five star chef! A++++++

At first, I thought that this was going to be more like one of those "cheese pies" since there was only 2 cakes of cream cheese...to my surprise,this was better than my normal "NY style cheesecake".  THIS IS THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!!!

This is the first time that I've ever even attempted to make a cheesecake - well of course that's not including the no-bake cheesecakes (that don't really count). Anyway, this was easy to make, even for me the novice, and more importantly it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! Everyone who ate this could not believe that it was homemade and not store bought, I've already had numerous requests for the recipe.  I strongly suggest trying this recipe, it's fabulous!

This is a cross between a cheesecake and an apple pie...if you are a cheesecake purist then you probably won't be completely satisfied, but if you are looking for a different twist, then this is worth a try.  Personally, I prefer my cheesecakes to be heavier (ie. more cream cheese in them), but I enjoyed the recipe regardless.  Not sure if I would make it again...

Yep, here's yet another Autumn Cheesecake fan.  Don't let the fact that you may not have a springform pan deter you from this great recipe! I couldn't find a springform pan to save my life, so used a 9x12 or some similar sized pan... it made the dessert quite thin, but then I felt less guilty about eating a bigger piece!  Added a little cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture, decreased baking time to 40-45 minutes, and drizzled some caramel sauce over it after baking.  My husband, Mr Picky, was loving it!  He gave it a "10" which is a very rare to never occurence.  Fabulous dessert!

This was a great recipe.  However, to accommodate for the 9 inch, I added to additional packs of cream cheese as well as 1 8oz. of sour cream.  The cheesecake turned out extremely light and fluffy.  Also, I decorated the plates with caramel which added extra flavor as well as a nicer presentation.

This turned out really well.  Unfortunately, I took it out of the oven a bit too soon.  I was nervous that the crust was starting to burn;  it hadn't but my filling was a bit soft.  Next time I make it, I'll follow the directions!  Whenever I make a new recipe, I always ask my husband, "Should I add it to the recipe book?", or "Would you ask me to make it again?"  Yes, yes to all of the above.  Thanks Stephanie for a great recipe.

Disappointing after all the high reviews. I added an extra egg, pkg of cream cheese and 1/4 cup of sugar (3/4 cup total) to the filling. I also added the zest of one orange. I baked it for 80 mins and it came out of the oven looking beautiful. 10 mins later it fell flat. If you add the extra egg and cream cheese, I think you definitely need to bake it an extra 10 mins - at least 90 mins total. The orange zest gave the filling a great flavor, but it wasn't sweet enough. I would increase the sugar in the filling to 1 cup total.

This cheesecake is so good!!  I doubled the cheesecake ingredients, used granny smith apples (chopped thin and small) and served it with caramel sauce.  I've made it a couple of times now and always get rave reviews!

This is an absolutely delicious cheesecake and it is so easy to make.  You have to try it to believe it! I baked it for the first time yesterday and I am sold! Within a day, the whole cake is gone. I brought some to my workplace and everyone raved about it. My family loved it too. Everyone said it is as good as those served in restuarants. Thanks for the receipe!

This was my first cheesecake and it was so easy to make and a lot quicker than other cakes I've made.  It is impressive to look at, and I would recommend dribbling a bit of caramel over the top as well.  Overall, a delicious treat loved by the family.

This tasted good but the cheese part turned out very thin. And perhaps I baked it for a bit too long, because it was quite dry.

Wow   what a super dessert!  Didn't want to share with anyone.  I used cinnamon graham crackers and added another 8oz of cream cheese and another egg as my pan was 10".  A keeper and will be a tradition if my son-in-law has his way.

Awesome dessert!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone gave it 5 stars (I have to admit I ate the leftovers for breakfast it was so good).  I am not a big baker and have never used a springform pan before and it was easy as pie! I used fugi apples.  They were very crisp even after cooking.  Thanks for the new recipe!

I am a newlywed and had my first Thanksgiving this year hosting both of our families.  As if that wasn't enough chaos, my kitchen was undergoing a remodel and was finished 9pm the night before the big day!  This was easy, but LOOKED like it took hours.  I received rave reviews!

I made this for my friends birthday instead of the traditional cake.  She told me 4 times how good it was while eating the same piece.  I take it that meant she realllly liked it.  I made it with a mix of gala and empire apples and I think the next time I would use something a little more tart.  I was afraid from the other reviews that it would be a little too sweet so I cut out some of the sugar.  The crust was what was sweet.  It also wasn't a big thick cheesecake, but the taste was fabulous.

I have been making this cheesecake for Thanksgiving for the last few years, and it is always a hit!  Last year I made the crust with gingersnap crumbs instead of graham cracker crumbs.  That made a nice change.  Can't wait to have it again this year!

I loved this recipe.  I used my KitchenAid stand alone mixer and my apple slicer/peeler and it was a breeze.  The combination sounds different, but it is wonderful!  Thanks for this recipe!

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first because of the apple topping, but after making it, the apples on top were the best part!  What a great cheesecake.  I'm definitely going to make this again.

This was my firt attempt at cheese cake and although it went very well, I didnt think it was all that the other reviews made it out to be.  I dont think I will make this one again - but I will definetly try one of the others listed - maybe a plain one next time

this was really good and easy to make -- not too rich like some cheesecakes tend to be.  the apples don't sink into the cheesecake and make it mushy; they stay separate so it's like having a baked apple topping (that's not gooey) on top a perfectly-moistened cheesecake. I don't think you need a springform pan.  I used a regular 9 inch cake pan and it turned out fine.

All the reviews I read were true!!  My company LOVED this dessert!!  I sliced the Red Delicious apples to about 4 mm thickness (not transparent), then cut the slices into moon shapes.

Next time, I will take more time placing the apple slices on the top of the cheesecake - you could really make it as aesthetically pleasing as it is good to eat!!

One more tip.  I've learned this the hard way!  If you have GREAT quality pans (like Williams & Sonoma brand springform pans, etc.), only use the MINIMUM baking time (or slightly less) for the crust and cakes/pies.  The good pans conduct heat so well that you can easily overcook them.

Exceptional recipe! Very easy to make. I brought this in to work and so did my significant other, it was a smash! One person said if I had my own bakery she would buy one of these! Now that's a compliment. My significant other layed the cheesecake on the table and 5 mins later, you know. I did't have any problem with the crust sticking as the prior review mentioned.

Amazing! My family LOVED it. You don't have to change a thing. However, I did go a little cinnamon crazy (adding it to the batter and what not) and I made a streusel topping that I added on for the last 20 min. of baking. It was the best thing I could have done. Be careful to not over-cook: 60 minutes is enough.

This cake was a nice one, especially for Fall.  It's somewhat like apple pie sitting atop cheesecake!  Since the recipe didn't specify the type of apple to use, I used Golden Delicious and it worked out well.  The only change I made to the recipe was dotting the apple layer with bits of butter to keep the apples moist.  And, to those of you who found the crust (which was very tasty, by the way!) to stick to the pan, I believe this is because the apple juices drip throughout the cake and crust; the extra sugary sweetness causes the crust to stick a bit.  A nice recipe - my family enjoyed it and I will likely make again.

This was really good. The crust was very easy and the aroma that filled my kitchen was out of this world. Oh and that taste, wholesome goodness. I would recommend this to anyone, the recipe is perfect as is. The only thing I added was some melted caramel when I took the cake out of the oven and drizzled it all over. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!  -- Moshi

I added this to my Thanksgiving menu and it was very good. My family liked it very much. Mine came out a little flat though. Is it supposed to be or did I do something wrong? I heard that you have to be careful with cheesecakes. It was still very delicious though. Thanks

Awesome and unique cheesecake recipe! I made some slight changes based on personal preference, and it turned out excellent: replaced pecans with chopped almonds in the crust, used my own personal cheesecake filling recipe that uses 3 packages cream cheese (made a thicker filling under the apples), cooked the apples in a saucepan til slightly tender before adding to the top of the cheesecake, whipped up a basic apple crisp crust to go around the top edges, and made a homemade caramel sauce for an optional drizzle. I baked it for about 70 mins and left in oven to cool about 45 minutes, though I probably could’ve baked it 5-10 minutes longer to be perfect. A new keeper! The topping and caramel recipes were also found on All Recipes.

I have made something like this for years, but I decided to read many of the top reviews and suggestions. Most of the reviewers I’m sure are more knowledgeable and better bakers than I am. Their suggestions probably make a classically defined cheesecake with apple topping.
Here’s the thing though. My wife does not like the typical best New York cheesecake money can buy, but she loves this one. I think because the recipe as written balances the apple with the cheesecake better for her taste. 
Many have suggested ways to precook the apples to reduce moisture, but guess what? My wife likes the extra caramelization that comes with the apple juice .
So for me, happy wife means leave the recipe alone.

Very delicious!!! I made this for a bonfire night and it was a huge success!!! I'm not sure why some reviewers had issues with their cheese cake setting mine turned out perfect. I did melt some caramels with heavy whipping cream and drizzled over the top and man oh man was it good!!!

If you're looking for an apple pie-type cheesecake, this is it! After reading many reviews I made this with the following changes: increased filling with 3/4 cup sour cream, added 1 more egg, increased sugar for filling to 3/4 cup. Wrapped springform pan with 2 layers foil to prevent leakage in water bath. Although beautiful the fanned apple slices, very difficult to slice for the apples drag through delicate cheesecake therefore recommend doing medium dices instead. Used NY state honeycrisp apples...PERFECT for baking for they remain firm but tender. DEFINTELY need to microwave apples for about 2 mins prior to mixing and dry on paper towels as well.  Made a "crisp" topping with flour, sugar, nuts and butter to scatter on top of seasoned apples. Use boiling water for water bath in large roaster. Finally, bake for 20 minutes at 400 drop heat to 350 for about 1 hour. Turn oven off, crack door open, let it hang out for couple hours in residual heat to set. Then remove, release pan(use knife around edges first), chill, etc. PERFECT. CREAMY. DELICIOUS. Took first place in an apple bake-off!

This was phenomenal! It didn’t last a total of 24hours in my house. I did however add a little extra to the topping before serving.....drizzled a little salted caramel over the top.

I chose to forgo the the caramel and pecans, but added some instant espresso powder to it and it was amazing. I would definitely recommend this recipe and foresee making it again.

I’ve made this a couple times and it is delicious! The second time I didn’t stress about making the top look like the picture...I wouldn’t count on it to have the nice arrangement

I have made this 3 times and not had any problems. Everyone loves it. I did double the filling and i also lined the bottom and inside of pan with parchment paper. Then when it was cooled i used schmuckers carmel squeeze bottle ice cream topping and lightly drizzled in top.

I've made this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and everyone loves it! The only reason it isn't five stars is because the filling as is wasn't enough for our tastes. I now make the crust and apple topping as listed, but I 1 1/2 times the filling. It's a stunner that always gets lots of compliments!

I wasn't sure how this was going to go, but I wanted to do a unique cheesecake. Loved the combination! My only wish is that there was a bit more "cheesecake" to this, but great overall.

The cheesecake turned out perfect for me. I follow the directions exactly but the only difference I made was through a pinch of nutmeg in the crust and into the apple mixture.
This was the first time I’ve ever made a cheesecake from scratch and it was perfect.

Perfect as is. Tastes like eating autumn. Great balance of texture and flavors. Microwave the apples for a minute before adding to the top of the cheesecake layer.

The crust on this cheesecake is soooo delicious.  The cheesecake is very tasty.  I sliced the apples super thin but I think I'll cut them a little thicker next time.   I know what I'm taking to Thanksgiving dinner

I really like this recipe, The tart apples combo really well with a crunchy crust and a creamy filling, However if i could recommend some additions
- I would cook it at a lower temperature for longer because 
   the sugar tends to burn and leave a nasty flavor.
- I would also add citric acid powder into the coating with the 
   apples to get an extra tart apple topping
-And doubling the cheesecake filling never hurts.

Made in a 10 inch pie plate as I don’t have a spring form.  Added 1/2 recipe to it and cooked it 10 minutes less in a water bath til 150* in the middle and it came out perfect. Arranged the Gravenstein apples on top in a spiral pattern and added a circle pattern of crumble topping. I used far less sugar in it too!. Took it to a party and everyone loved it!

I found this recipe for the first time in October and have already made it three times. I just make a fancy design on the top with the apples and I never have leftovers! I cook often for church dinners and this has become a favorite.

I had a 12 in pan, so my cheesecake came out a little thin.  But I didn’t do any variations on the recipe.  I cooked it for the full 70 minutes then let it cool room temp for a while.  I didn’t find a need to pre bake the apples, but I cut them really thin.  I can see needing to do that if you use larger pieces.  I also used larger pecan pieces on the top, which added the little crunch to it.  I enjoyed this cheesecake.

I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews and add 3 block of cream cheese and microwave the apples. what a mess to take to a special dinner. I will make it again BUT follow the reviews next time to ensure a better end result.  disappointed I was in a hurry to make a beautiful fall dessert this time

The cheesecake itself wasn't bad at all, but the apples were just an off texture for my family. I should have semi-cooked the apples, as suggested, and it may have been better. May try this again, although my husband says no, my 2-yr. old says yes!

I cheated and used a store bought crust. Added an extra thing of cream cheese, an extra egg and a little extra sugar. After baking I cracked the oven and let it sit in the oven for an hour (pan of water included). This turned out very tasty. I'm not a huge fan of apples in my desserts but my husband enjoyed it!

This turned out beautiful and was devoured quickly.  The only comment or suggestion from my family was that it would probably be good with a little caramel drizzled on it.  I am making it again today for another group and trying this addition.  I made the cheesecake recipe 1.5 times larger (due to the pan I was using, but now I see that has been a suggestion from other people so I'm not sure if It is a perfect cheese cake just as the recipe was submitted though. It drives me crazy when reviews are done on revised recipes instead of the original and now I am doing it too.  Great taste for fall and with the apples it has a nice little tang to it over the usual sweeter berry cheese cakes...loved it.  Other reviewers added a bit of a crumb topping, might try this too but the apples looked lovely on the first one I made.

made the sautéed apple recipe found on this site which I used for topping plus placed a layer of apples on top of crust before adding cream cheese filling.  Used 3 cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4c. sugar and 3/4 tsp vanilla.  Baked in water bath 70 min and let it sit in warm oven for 30 min.

Followed the advice of several reviewers and increased the cream cheese by 1 pkg and added an egg.  Also increased the sugar and vanilla.  This was my first attempt at making any type of cheesecake and it turned out great!  Will certainly make it again.

I have made this cheesecake many many times.  My husband and I love it.  I double both graham cracker crust and the filling of the cheesecake.  I use a water bath also.  I put parchment paper in the bottom of my springform pan for easy removal.  It is the most awesome cheesecake.  I have made many cheesecakes over the years but this one is my tried and true.  I do mix up some brown sugar and flour with some butter and sprinkle it over the top of the apples which I dice not slice just a personal preference.    Mmmmmmm

This was the first time I baked a cheesecake.  I wanted something different for dessert for Thanksgiving.  I was a little nervous but it turned out wonderful and it was so delicious.  If I could make it, I'm sure anyone else can.

Made this for Valentines Day.  It was W.O.N.D.E.R.F.U.L.  I loved the pecans in the crust, it really makes a difference.  My son, who doesn't like "sweets" ate and ate and ate this.  I would note, however, that this recipe baking times would depend on the oven's accuracy in temperature and type.  I made it in a gas oven and am used to using electric.  Gas gets hotter quicker and stays up higher longer.  Otherwise this was awesome!

Absolutely the best cheesecake I've ever had. I didn't read any of the previous posts so I was a little concerned that it wouldn't come out ok. But it was delicious. I did double up the ingredients on the cheesecake and toppings part since the crust was a little too thick.  If you want to make a smaller serving only so 1/2 the crust ingredients. Otherwise.... Absolutely yummy!

My cheesecake is not out of the oven yet, but I can tell it is a winner. I sampled the cream cheese mixture and the baked graham cracker crust and they are both tasty.  I was worried this would be a long complicated prep but it was very easy. 

Will definitely make for Thanksgiving!

I made this with the changes by NOELC under the Most helpful positive review.  I did it exactly as she noted  by doubling the filling and adding the crumb topping.  I used Fuji apples since they are my favorite and are very sweet.  It was absolutely delicious!  I took it to a work luncheon for about 25 people, and everyone raved about it.  It was gone in no time.  I did not use a water bath but put the springform on a Pampered chef bar pan.  The cake did crack in two places, but it still looked and tasted great.  I will definitely make this again.  It would be a great Thanksgiving dessert, I think.

I followed the recipe and it was pretty much a total disaster.     Next time I will try some of the tips offered and use a smaller pan instead of doubling everything.

Like others I added an extra package of cream cheese and egg, baked for 70 minutes in a water bath then turned off the ovenue let cool in oven with door propped open for about 45 minutes then placed in fridge. Also added a crumb topping on top so where it's more like a Dutch Apple. Very easy

I added an extra egg as some suggested, but I did not double the ingredients like many said they did. I don't think it needs it! Obviously the original is delicious or they wouldn't have posted it. I did try the added "crumb" topping someone else suggested and I wouldn't do it again. Made the top a bit gummy. I will however add extra apple next time just because I LOVE apple. Fantastic recipe.

I followed recipe as shown except I made a crumble topping with some grahm crackers, oatmeal, brown sugar & melted butter. 15 min. before the end of baking time, I added topping & put back in oven for the last 15 min. Just wonderful.For me apples need a crumble topping...otherwise the recipe was perfect!

My family absolutely loved this. I added canned apples on top of the base and then poured the cheesecake layer. Added only a few Granny Smith apples to the top layer and doubled the mixture as per the other comments. I will definitely make this again.

I used this as the base cheesecake recipe, so omitted the apple top and made a chocolate/vanilla swirl cheesecake that I served with the Ginger Pear Cranberry Sauce recipe by Chef John that's on this site.  Baked in an 8" round pan in a water bath for 70 minutes, then turned off the oven and left it in there with the door propped open for an hour.  Wonderful and no cracks!

LIke many other reviewers I increased the amount of cheesecake, I only did an extra half. Next time I think I will double it.  I  used a 10" springform pan. The other change was I separated the eggs. Mixed in each yolk separately. Whipped the egg whites and folded into the batter. This made the cheesecake very light and fluffy.

One of the best cheesecakes I have made! I minced my apples and made a crumb topping with butter, flour and brown sugar. I poured half of the cheesecake batter into the pan and then swirled in some homemade apple butter! Absolutely fabulous!

this was my first cheesecake attempt. i made it for the first thanksgiving we hosted for my family as an alternative to our traditional pie spread, and it turned out fabulous. the apples didn't cut cleanly, me not having microwaved them first, but the appearance of the cake was quite striking.

This is  AMAZING!!! I changed a couple things and will change a couple more next time. I will dice the apples and put them on top. After microwaving them for a minute like the other reviews suggested I found them to get a little rubbery. I also incresed the crust by an extra half of everything. As some reviews suggested I also added an extra egg and 8oz more of creamcheese. This was by far the easiest and best cheesecake I have made! Thanks for sharing!

Took some work, had a bit of a mishap with the springform (first time using it! haha) but well worth it! Had a dinner party including 5 basketball players and made the pumpkin swirl cheesecake as well and the guys finished them off (not hard for bball players but still!). Also did a gluten free crust with ginger snaps from Trader Joes and it worked great! Love this recipe and will make it again soon!

Wow.  My experience was really weird.  My first piece, I was so disappointed.  The texture wasnt good, the filling had almost no flavor... I was just so disappointed.  But, I decided to keep it rather than throw it away so I put it in the frig and thought maybe I would try to make another but first I came back to read some more reviews.  So then I was thinking maybe I didnt let it bake long enough.  But it was covered with Crumble stuff, and it never occured to me that it might not be done.  So I decided to go back and see if it had set up any better, and much to my surprise, the taste is really good now.  I have been sampling on strong tastes and strong garlic and balsamic all afteroon, so maybe my taste buds were just overloaded.  After coming back to it, I thought it tasted so much better.  So I dont know if it cooled more?  Set up more?  Or if my taste buds were off the garlic overload and could taste the cheesecake, but I think I will be able to serve it to my guests tomorrow afterall :-)

i would probably have given this a 3, but many other's enjoyed it so i will compromise with a 4.  i'm not sure why but the flavor just didn't do it for me.  perhaps the cream cheese part wasn't rich enough?  thanks anyway though!

If you are anything like me, you think apple pie in the autumn, well you will be making this cheesecake year round.  The flavor of this is so dazzling you will have request for it or the recipe every time you make it.

So delicious! We took this to dinner with friends and everyone loved it. My hubby makes cheesecake all the time and this was the best. We sauteed apples in a pan with butter, cinnamon and brown sugar. Then we arranged them on top of the cheesecake

My first cheesecake was a success.My hubby loved this. I cheated and used a ready made 9 inch graham cracker crust. The filling was deliocious . I used granny smith apples. However, next time will use a mixture of granny smith and gala apples. Microwaving the apples for 2 mins and draining the liquid is a good idea.

This was okay, but not my favorite cheesecake.  Maybe I just don't like the apple/cheesecake combo. The men really liked it, but I noticed most of the women only ate half of what was on their plate.  I was very worried about the apples being tough, but I sliced them very thin as other reviewers suggested, and they were fine.

Good cheesecake recipe...don't think the apples work as well as expected! Apples are good, but chewy.  Maybe use as a middle layer? Still good, just not the best! May try again.

It tastes DIVINE! I made this for my boyfriend surprise birthday party and took it to campus. I got raving reviews from all my friends and they literally couldn't stay away from the cake box wolfing down every crumb of the cake, which made me had to put the activity to a halt because I wanted to bring back some pieces for bf's mom and granny.  I doubled the recipe and used a 24-cm springform pan, but apparently the crust needs more butter to hold the cracker crumbs stronger. I baked it for 70 minutes in water-bath and cooled it down in the oven for 1 hour. I used Granny Smith, the tartness scales down the sweetness from sugar. Since it's pretty hard for me to find pecans here, I subbed it with cashews. I forgot to throw-in the nut in the topping but I made a streusel topping NOELC suggested in this recipe which brings the whole taste of cheesecake to another level!  Thanks Stephanie for making my bf's surprise birthday a blast with the cake!! I owe you big time!

I can`t say my family liked this cheesecake so much. I think apples are not good idea for cheesecake. Better to use apples for pies. The taste of this cheesecake is ordinary. I had such feeling that I ate curds with apples. You may find really wonderful cheesecakes on this site.

I didn't change a thing from the recipe and it is fantastic! I basically cannot show up to a family get together without one in hand and an extra in the fridge for later (its even better the next day). I've cheated and used the premade crust and it's great, but it's even better when you make the crust yourself. Phenomenal recipe!

I have made many many cheesecakes over the years and this was the best one by far.  I am planning on using this filling for all future cheesecakes but I'll try them with different crust and toppings. Use a food processor to slice the apples if you have one.  It saves so much time and you'll need them that thin for the best results.  I didn't change anything about the recipe and everyone loved it.

The crust on this was amazing! I did alter the recipe a bit for my own personal likings.  I used 3 packages of cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup of sour cream, 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and 3-4 small granny smith apples.  I cut up the apple pieces into thin slices, about 12 slices per apple, and arranged them decoratively.  What i would do different would be to add more sour cream.  Possibly 1 cup or 1.5 cups.  I'll have to play around with the recipe further to find my perfect combination.

Excellent recipe. The only change I would make is to double the amount of cream cheese.

I made a cheesecake based on this recipe and did some modification.  Basically it tastes good and my friends love it, but a liitle too sweet.  Maybe next time I'll make another one with less sugar.

We really liked this cake. I think it could use more cream cheese filling, so next time I will double it. Definitely a keeper!! The cake was done after 70 minutes and the apples were good and tender, not burnt. I didn't change anything except, I had to leave out the nuts, since my husband is allergic.

So easy and delicious!

This was the first cheesecake I ever made, and it came out perfectly.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use roasted pecans or raw pecans.  I opted for the roasted pecans, and they worked perfectly.  So, so yummy!  My husband really loves it, too, and is already asking me to make it again for him and his pals next week.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe whatsoever, and I definitely did not have to bake it in a water bath.  It turned out absolutely perfect as is.

I was a little disappointed with the outcome of this recipe. I followed the advice of reviewers: microwaved apples, 3 cream cheese, 3 sugar, etc. However, the apples burnt on the edges while baking. I had to pull off the burnt ones and simply place my leftover apples on top. And even with the cheesecake ingredient adjustment, the cake was still a little runny. 
You know what they need to invent? A springform pan that you don't have to wrap in foil to put in a water bath. I had no aluminum foil and I desperately used an alternative. Lol, I tied a plastic grocery sack around the pan. Believe it or not, it actually worked well.

I was unfortunately disappointed with this. I suppose it's unfair to give it 3 stars when I made a change. Based on other reviews I added 3/4c sour cream because I favor a lighter cheesecake. I found that it took 80 minutes in the oven before it was done. The end result was a dry grainy cheesecake. Also I noticed when checking on it after about 40 min of baking that the apples looked liked they were getting dry & rubbery, and indeed they were. I like the idea of putting the apples on top of cheesecake though, perhaps they just needed a little liquid? Also I highly recommend not removing the springform sides until after it's chilled, otherwise your cheesecake may collapse some if it's not set yet. I've made many cheesecakes and this is the one thing that's always a given.

Very good!  
I made it into mini cheesecakes: it makes 12 standard muffin pan sized cheesecakes.  I baked @ 350 for 30 minutes.
The house smelled completely delicious the whole time they were in the oven.

I followed the advice of others, microwaving the apples for a bit before putting on them on the cheesecake and that worked well.  I didn't know what someone meant by doubling the cheesecake part b/c it's runny, so I just doubled the cream cheese and added one more egg and it worked perfectly.  My husband is a huge fruit fan and not into cheesecake and he LOVED this recipe!  I used Pillsbury's Bordeaux cookies instead of graham crackers and found that give the crust more substance (doesn't get soggy like graham cracker crust can).  I also baked in a water bath and that has proven to be the tried and true baking method for the cheesecakes I've made.  My husband is begging me to make this for Thanksgiving Dinner!

This is by far the best cheesecake I have made.  I don't like really rich cheesecake.  This was just delish.  I did follow a couple suggestions and made an extra half of the filling.  Also I cut the apples in small pieces, which made it easier to cut.  I microwaved the apples for a minute and spooned the apples (w/o juice) on the cake.  then I put the pecans into the apple juice and put the pecans on top.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

This was good but it wasn't as great to me as some of the reviews proclaimed.  I did add an additional package of cream cheese and sugar and egg as others suggested and it took a little over a hour and a half to bake thoroughly.  I sliced the apples thin and did not cook them prior to adding to the cheesecake.  After it finished baking and cooled, I drizzled a little caramel sauce on the top.

delicious I did follow the advise of others and increased the cheesecake ingredients, also the sugar topping it turned out beautiful. I drizzled a warm caramel sauce made up of 5oz of evaporated milk and 14oz of caramel pieces it was to die for! the warm sauce over the cold cheesecake WOW! try it you won't regret it!

Awsome! Have been looking for a recipe for french apple cream cheese pie, which we used to get at Poppin Fresh Pie.  My husband loved it and says better than french apple cream cheese.  I have been looking for this for 15 yrs.  Thanks so much.

This cheesecake was really good! It was my first time making a cheesecake. I doubled the crust ingredients and the filling...however, it took forever to cook and the apples started getting hard because of that. Next time I make it I will just try the recipe as is. Also, drizzled hot caramel over it.

Try with caramel sauce 1 1/2 c. gr. crakcers 2. Use 3 pkg cr. cheese, 3/4 c. sugar, 3 eggs, 3/4 tsp. vanilla in cheesecake 3. microwave apples for 2 minutes, no crumb topping. 4. Bake in waterbath for 70 minutes. Cool with door open for 45 minutes. W/o apples, try 60 minutes. Make sure cheesecake is not to close to top in oven. Cover really well with aluminum foil to avoid moist crust (2-3 times). Place cheesecake in pan first and then fill half full with hot water. Maybe 55 minutes

This was a good cheesecake, but I didn't think it was anything spectacular. I did modify it a bit. I don't have a springform pan, only a glass pie dish, so instead of doubling the cream cheese mixture, like others recommend, i just halved the apple part. But I think I would've actually liked more apples on it. I also nuked them in the micro for a couple minutes and drained the juice. I added the crumble topping, as well which I liked. I baked with a water bath, as recommended and let sit in oven for a while after it was done baking. When it was done and had chilled for a while, i served it with some butterscotch topping (thought I had caramel, but didn't) and that was good. I don't know that I'm crazy about this recipe, but it is good.

First Cheesecake I have ever made! And it came out great! My husband had to ask me several times if I actually made it! The only thing I changed was that I used Splenda instead of sugar. I am so proud!
So trust me, if I can make it, YOU can make this!

This was my first attempt at cheesecake and I was very pleased with the results. Hubby loved it and suggested I make it every year! I only had two 8oz packets of cream cheese and it was fine. I also only had 1/2 cup of pecans, and I used it on the top. I also made a topping of brown sugar, and flour and cooked the cake over a pan of water. Used granny smith apples. Fantastic! Can't wait to make again nest year. Thanks for an outstanding recipe!

This is one of the best cheesecakes ever!  I followed several of the suggestions, but I think it would have been good as written too.  I'll definitely have to take this to work because it's too dangerous to leave in my fridge!

I made this last night for the first time and shared it at our church retreat.  I personally didn't get to eat any of it, but it was all gone and my husband said on a scale of 1-10 he would give it 10.5.  Will make this again. Thank you for sharing it.

This was the first time I've made cheesecake and it was easy to make and quite delicious. I followed the suggestions of using 1 and 1/2 times the cheese filling, microwaving the apples and adding a little butter and graham crackers to the pecans for the top of the cake.
The cake was not too rich and looked really nice. It was even better the second day after being in the fridge all night.

I feel kind of tacky that I did not come up with the recipe myself but this is the one i usually make for holidays. This recipe is fantastic, hands down. I even bought a higher quality springform pan just because the recipe is worth putting extra time etc into because it is very good and very attractive.

I altered the recipe a little, using one of those pre-made crusts and halving the cream cheese filling. I stuck the apples (after microwaving them for 60 seconds) and some oatmeal streusel on top of the cheesecake, baked it for 35 minutes at 350 degrees, but once the cheesecake cooled down it was runny !!! Did anybody else have problems of the cheesecake not cooking completely? Maybe I should have left it in the oven longer, but it's really hard to check if it's done since the apples are on top. Next time, I might just cook the cheesecake first, stick apples on (after cooking them in the microwave), and omit the streusel...

otherwise, taste was phenomenal!!

A little different, but good. The only problem is cooking the apples long enough but not overcooking the cheesecake... I had to settle for slightly crunchy apples.

Great cheescake!  I made this for Christmas and I had people requesting the recipe.  Rather than topping the cheesecake with sliced apples I diced them up and sprinkled them on top.  I was going to microwave the apples first but forgot and the cheesecake still turned out great!

Simply AWESOME!  Made for my daughter's birthday this fall and it was fantastic.  I precooked the apples as suggested and placed on top.  Finished with additional crumb topping.

Wonderful!  This dessert has become a favorite in my family. My recommendations are to always bake the dish in a water bath. In addition, I like to cube some of the apples to stire into the cheesecake mixture. It provides a little extra apple flavor in each bite.

This was very good.  I cut the recipe in half and made two mini cheesecakes with it.  As recommended in some other reviews, I microwaved the apples for a little while to soften them and drained some of the liquid before putting them in the cake.  Also, after the apple layer, I topped the cake with a mixture of flour, brown sugar and butter to make a crumb topping.  I baked for 60-65 minutes in a water bath and drizzled a little caramel sauce on top when it came out of the oven.  I cooled it overnight in the refrigerator. It came out good though the cake is not as creamy as I usually like.  I will probably try this again as a full recipe in a larger pan to see if the texture comes out better.

This recipe is great.  We followed some of the other recommendations to put the apples under or layered in the cheesecake mixture.  The first time we tried it I left a few pieces of apple scattered over the top and they were a little chewy.  But the ones inside the mixture were soft and delicious.
If you leave the pecans out of the crust, make sure to use more graham crackers (my crust was a little thin).
I also drizzled caramel over the crust and apple layers.  It was a big hit.
Thank you!

Yum yum.  1.5X the cheesecake ingredients was perfect!  I did microwave the apples 1 minute and blot them with a paper towel to soak up extra moisture.  It came out delicious!

We did not like this recipe at all.   The cheesecake was not very sweet.  Although the apples cooked well and tasted good by themselves they do not go well with the cheesecake.  Will not try this recipe again.

great recipe, but I as with everyone else I have a few notes.
 The Metric recipe calls for 500g of apples, which is a little OTT, in the end I used about 3-4 apples (not sure how much that is in weight) and had enough to put a  layer of apple underneath the cheesecake mixture and another on top (which I recommend by the way) with some left over to snack on while it cooked.

This was incredibly easy to make.  I did use some of the tips give to make it.  I doubled the cream cheese to 4 pkg.  I did microwave the apples which really seemed to help and I topped with pecans and some caramel topping.  It came very high and looked great.  I've made a lot of cheesecake and this was fast and easy!!  Also, a apple peeler, corer & slicer is a must.....had the apples cut and ready in minutes!!

I made this for Rosh Hashana and everybody loved it.  I doubled the cheesecake part, made 1.5x the crust part and sprinkled the extra half crust ingreds on top of the apples.  Cooked for 70 mins then opened oven door and let cool.  Drizzled caramel sauce over the top before serving.

This is an amazing cheesecake!  I added a caramel sauce just prior to serving each slice; pretty and tasty!  The only negative thing I have to say about this cheesecake is that it's a little thin (short).  I think that two blocks of cream cheese makes for an awfully thin cheesecake in a 9" pan.  I recommend a smaller pan, or more batter to make it a little taller.

Everyone was crazy about this pie but me.  I thought it was okay, but needed a little something more (like maybe more cheesecake - less topping?!)  But everyone else LOVED it and I had tons of people asking for the recipe.  Definalty a crowd pleaser!

Delicious!  I used an 8 1/2 inch springform pan and doubled the filling as suggested by others...came out the perfect thickness.  So simple!  I added some warm caramel sauce over individual pieces when serving.  YUMMY

Hardest part of this recipe is peeling, cutting, and placing the apples.  If you love cheesecake and apples, it is totally worth it each and every time.

This is a great cheesecake, a little different which is good!  I did change it some; used 1 & 1/2 cream cheese mixture, and also added a crumb topping mixed with the nuts which I added toward the end of the baking time.  Also drizzled with caramel before serving.  Excellent!

WONDERFUL!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe states except as I'm in the UK I used digestive biscuits instead of graham crackers.  They're pretty much the same thing.  I like how the topping covers the cheesecake top as sometimes cheesecakes can be quite unattractive on top.  It smelled heavenly while baking.  I thought the cheese filling would be too thin but it turned out to be perfect.  Next time I'll use a little less butter in the crust since I prefer it crumblier.

This cheesecake is amazing...I have never met anyone who didn't love it.  I usually do 1 1/2 times the cheesecake filling recipe and add a crumb topping.  When the cheesecake finishes baking, stick it in the broiler to brown slightly and you have a beautiful and scrumptious cake!

This cheesecake was awesome!  There were two things that went wrong, but I'll fix them next time.  I used an 8-inch pan instead of a 9-inch, and that worked out fine.  My problems were that I baked it in a water bath, and the water seeped through the foil and into the crust, which turned out soggy.  Also, I used granny smith apples, which had a perfect taste, but I should have cooked them first, because they were a little crunchy for my taste.  I made a crumb topping with flour, butter, brown sugar and pecans, then I drizzled caramel topping on the slices before serving them.  My family loved it, and I will definitely make it again, but I'll fix my mistakes.

My boyfriend loved this recipe.  It is not as thick as regular cheesecake and thats what he liked.  I thought it was unusual but very delicious.  I love apples, its an unusual twist for cheesecake.  A change from cherry and blueberry.

Great recipe.  The only problem was I use a 10" pan so the cake was a little thin.  Next time I'll  go half again bigger for the actual cake filling.  Also when buying pecans ensure they are actually pecans and not walnuts in a bag marked pecans, Planters strikes again.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did take the time to arrange the apple slices in circles on the top of the cake.  Then I sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar over them.  I thought the apples got a little chewy.  I did not double the filling because it was just for my husband and I.  I would double it if I were making this for a crowd.  It was a little thin.

Fantastic cheesecake. I used this recipe to make a plain cheesecake since I couldn't really find a plain cheesecake recipe. Delicious! No one knew it was supposed to have a topping! Definately double the recipe if not adding a topping though, cause it can be thin without the apples.

Well, the combination of apples and cheesecake is rather good,but there seems to be something missing in the filling,not rich enough. Can anyone advice me on how to keep the base crunchy? It just turn soggy and soft when cooled.Pre-baking the crust doesn't seem to help.

I brought desert to a dinner and this cheesecake was a big hit.  Definitely a keeper! I followed the tips summarized about 7 reviews back by "noelc." I put the water in a shallow pan on the rack below the baking cheesecake. Next time I might try using 1 1/2 times the filling recipe rather than doubling.  Although it did look very impressive.  I just think the topping might be more appreciated if the filling weren't so thick.
Thanks Stephanie for sharing this great recipe!!

This was the first time I made cheesecake and it turned out wonderful!  It was very easy to make and all my guests raved about it!  I chose not to do the water bath as some others recommended.  I also added the pecans to the topping the last 20 minutes of baking.  I'll definately make this again when I want an impressive dessert!

this was good, but didn't knock my socks off.  there was something missing in the flavor of the filling...  i used light cream cheese so maybe i'll try regular next time - or try adding more vanilla.  i didn't have a springform pan so used a pyrex pie dish and hoped for the best - the consistency was just fine.  i'd like to try this w/a different fruit on top.

Absolutely fantastic! My first cheesecake ever!  I did double the cheese-mixture. Baked it for 75 minutes, then turned off the oven and left it for another hour.  Next time I will microwave the apples prior to baking--they were a little tough.

I added one extra cream cheese, egg and some extra sugar.  I also added orange zest.  Since I had frozen apples, I cooked them and made a pie filling sauce and put that on the cheesecake and baked it.  I loved this!!

This was delicious.  I made a few little changes.  I remembered my mom making a similar dessert years ago and tried to adjust the recipe.  I used granny smith apples with the peeling on, doubled the cream cheese mixture and put it in a 9x 13 pan.  I then topped it with a crumb topping, butter, sugar and flour.  It was a great fall dessert.

Five stars doesn't do it justice.  I was a little short of the cream cheese, about 1/4 c. so I added a dollop of sour cream.  This was fantastic!!!!

This is one of the best cheesecake I've ever made. Thanks Stephanie. My husband and children usually do not like green apples, but with this cheesecake, everything finished within minutes. I recommended it to friends, especially those cheesecake-lovers, they also loved it.

Delicious!  This is the easiest thing that I prepared for Thanksgiving.  It took almost no time to throw together.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, but you would never know it, it came out very rich.  I also ended up using a lot more cinnamon and sugar to coat the apples than what was called for.

I was making this cake to take over to a neighbor's house for dinner and burned it on my first try.  Since it took a little time for me to make it I tried it before making another one.  NEEDLESS TO SAY that a second one got made right away and it is absolutely wonderful.  The second time I made it I arranged the apples in a spiral patten on top, and it looked like I had bought it somewhere.  The cream cheese laye IS thin, but I can't imagine it any other way because it would detract from he wonderful flavor of the apples!  YUMMY!

Loved this recipe.  The apples were crisp which was a great contrast to the cheesecake texture.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Am planning to use during the holiday season.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this one.  It was easy to make and my husband, who hates cheescake, had several slices. I will make this one again.

I was very impressed with the finished product.
 The flavor of the crust was the best I have made so far, and overall the cheesecake was very impressive. It was more like a torte than a cheesecake.  My family loved it and my daughters want the recipe.

I love cheesecake...any kind, this one came out a bit flat--but looked like it rolled out of a NY dessert shop--looked awesome with the sliced apple topping!

I made this cheesecake for a company christmas party, along with two other flavored cheesecakes.  It was gone before the other two were even looked at.  I still have trouble convincing people that I made it and didn't buy it at a bakery.

made this for a new years eve party....decided to adjust it a little and make it low-fat, by using fat-free and low-fat cream cheeses....also added a third pack of cream cheese and an extra egg! used 2 egg whites and one whole egg.
the cake was a hit....it looked and tasted great......and was very easy to make. definately make it again!

First time to try this was at Thanksgiving!  It turned out beautiful and I plan to make it for a Christmas luncheon at work.  It had a wonderful taste and the apples I used (Granny Smith) added the perfect topping flavor!  Already put it in my recipe box!  Give it a try, it's easy and looks like out of a magazine!

An unusual touch to the typical cheesecake - but sooo delicious. The only problem was that it came out a little thin - but overall it was excellent and great for a fall treat.

I doubled the filling.  It was the best looking dessert and I won a prize at work for it.  I think it was also the best tasting.  Also, instead of graham crackers for crust I used animal cookies.

I love cheesecake and I thought I'd try this, because it sounded different.  The most time consuming part (for me) was cutting the apples up and arranging them on top so that they would look pretty.  This recipe isn't THE best (I'm not really an apple person to begin with) but it is a nice change and it was much better than I thought it would be.

This recipe truely was delicious!!!  Very easy to make and like the other readers said "smelled awesome as it was baking".  I was a bit hesitant in trying this recipe as the idea of apples and cheesecake just did not sit well with me or my family as we are use to either strawberries or cherry as a topping.  But with all the great reviews this received I JUST HAD TO TRY IT.  I AM DEFINITELY NOT SORRY I DID.  Have added this cheesecake to my favorite's list.  YUUUMMMMMYYYYYY!!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I cooked it for the maximum time listed and it turned out perfectly.  I drizzled caramel ice cream topping over each piece before serving and it was the perfect touch!  Definitely a keeper!

This is the best.  Something completly different than the "normal" cheescake always prepared.

I made this cheesecake as a special for the teachers at my high school. I got so many good comments on it that I plan on using it again. Thank you for a easy and delicious recipe.

Everyone loved this recipe.  The only thing that I would change would be to lessen the amount of sugar- it was a little on the sweet side.

Wonderful recipe!!  I was amazed at how easy the crust was to make...I love cinnamon, so I used cinnamon graham crackers in addition to the cinnamon called for in the recipe.  Everyone loved it and I had many requests for the recipe!

I made this cheesecake for a simple gathering in the middle of July and everyone raved about it!  My daughter, who is not a cheesecake eater, ate every bite of her piece!

This was easy and yummy.  I personally prefer my cheesecakes thicker, and this is a "thinner" cheesecake.  The blend of tastes was very good.  I'll make this again.

This cheesecake is very good, but I baked it for exactly the time instructed and it was slightly burned on the bottom and sides.  I know ovens can vary, but mine is usually on the cooler side rather than the hotter.  Maybe it's because I used the low-fat cream cheese.  Anyway, I'll definitely make it again and just cook it a little less.  Great recipe!

I never thought I would be able to make a cheescake.  This recipe is easy, quick and provides a nice deviation from the same old type of cheesecake.  I plan to make it for our Thanksgiving feast - and hope to make it a tradition.
