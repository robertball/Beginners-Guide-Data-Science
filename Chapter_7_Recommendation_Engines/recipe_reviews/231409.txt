Wonderful combination of flavors and textures! This salad was perfect for a light lunch - all I had to do was top it with some leftover grilled chicken.  I used a fat free feta and tossed in some sliced almonds. For the raspberry vinaigrette, I used "Fresh Raspberry Balsamic Vinaigrette" from this site. Thanks for an easy, yet delicious recipe!

This is a nice salad,bacon is always good in my mind. I used real bacon instead of bits. Next time I will use a homemade poppy seed dressing that will go very well with this salad.

I made this with a few changes. I used BALSAMIC vinegar, not white. I just like the sweet and savory flavor of it. I also used SMOKED PAPRIKA rather than regular. Also I used just 1 Tbsp of raw sugar (I think the recipe called for a lot more sugar. This was plenty!) I didn't have poppy seeds so that got left out. I assembled this and refrigerated it for maybe 30 minutes and that was enough. Not sure why they say to chill it for longer. Not necessary. This came out excellent! I can't give it five stars  with white vinegar in the recipe, but I give it four because they gave me the base for MY five star salad!

Family loved it.   This is a fast easy recipe and great flavor.   I did a couple of minor tweaks.   Instead of bacon bits I used bacon which I had fried up in the morning diced up.   I also added 1 large handful of wild blueberries.  I did not add the dressing but had it to one side so family could add as much as they wanted.   It was perfect.    Thank you Malloylk for sharing this recipe.

I used the balsamic vinegar I had on hand instead of the raspberry dressing.  I only added half the raw onion. This is the second time I've made a recipe from here and followed it mindlessly instead of heeding my own good sense. Never, EVER, put raw onions into something - particularly in a cold dish like salad. It overwhelmed all the other flavors. And upset my stomach later. I ate about a third of it in a stubborn bid not to waste food. Couldn't continue.

This salad was awesome- made it for a group of friends and it all disappeared. The only slight change I made was reducing the amount of onion, otherwise kept it the same. Would definitely make it again

Sorry we forgot the feta for the pic. Salad was Excellent! Sherri made a few changes for us, but overall very simple and tasty! Sherri toasted her own pecans is BS and butter, (Southern Treat). She also made her own sugar-free raspberry vinaigrette. Baked Chicken and feta to top it off. Great, simple and very good Heart Healthy supper.
