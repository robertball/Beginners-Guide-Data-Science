Have been making this for years, but my dish calls for studding your meat( I prefer pork), with garlic and adding a can of beef consomme and one can of water along with the pepperonchinis. I pretoast my crusty rolls with garlic butter, then put meat and mozza/ Havarti cheese on bun and pop back in the oven to melt cheese. Also, serve with individulal portions of the drippings for dipping! Yummy!

My family absolutely loved this. My 12 year old son is such a picky eater and requested this same meal the following week. It’s SO EASY too. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. We used Hoagie rolls.

I made this as instructed and it was the Best!  Very flavorful.  I would have never thought of adding the peppers.  I've used a pkg of Italian dressing and it was good but not nearly as good as this.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Everyone loved this simple recipe, just feels like something is missing. I will make again and try adding some Italian seasoning.

I was very skeptical but this was quite good! I tasted the broth before returning the shredded beef and felt it needed a little something. So I stirred in a heaping spoonful of some Vegetable Better Than Bouillon (I prefer it over the beef flavor) and that helped a lot. Served on heated crusty rolls with melted provolone. Yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe! I did add about a cup of beef broth with the peppers for more juice. After it was cooked I sliced the peppers and tossed them in with the meat, which we piled on hard rolls with mozzarella cheese. Add Caesar salad and voila, a fantabulous meal!

This is the perfect mix of stupid-easy and delicious! We tried it at home and everyone loved it, so we put it on our list of meals to make while on vacation the following week! After a day on the beach, this yummy dinner was waiting for us! We had it with provolone on soft sub rolls and a salad.

These sandwiches taste amazing and are incredibly easy to make. We put the meat on buns and broil 1-2 minutes with melted provolone cheese.

This was the simplest thing to make, and it was awesome!   Absolutely outstanding.  Hubby and I both loved it.  Will be in regular rotation at our house.  Bonus: Hubby found pepperoncinis that were already sliced in the jar!

I have made this and it was very tasty.  The only thing that I would mention is that the meat was done after 7 hours not 8.  This could be because my crockpot cooks hotter.
