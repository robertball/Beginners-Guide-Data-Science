My husband and I really like this recipie. We used fresh Cod filets instead of the salted cod and it comes out very good.

Love this recipe and make it quite often. My family in Portugal makes this recipe in a saucepan instead of in the oven but the taste is the same. We call it "Bacalhau a Sevilhana". Delicious!

This is a very good recipe---we had friends from Norway who prepared this for us recently, and we loved it.  However, the cooked it on the stove top at medium heat for about and hour, and I preferred this method as it made more of a fish stew than the casserole method listed here.  We ladled it out on to thick slices of sourdough bread, and it was fabulous.

This is excellent - I could not find salted cod - I used fresh and steamed it until tender.  I also found that if you saute the onions first, it is better.  Easy and my whole family loved it.

Incredible!!!!  VERY TASTY!  I did not use salted cod fish, because I did not have any.  Instead I salted the fish after adding it to the casserole.  I also added 2 medium onions and that was perfect.  I left out the red pepper flakes and instead replaced them with additional paprika.  The result, incredible!  My husband and I do not care for a "fishy" taste so this was PERFECT!  I highly reccomend this dish!  Definately a keeper!  Thanks VERY much for sharing.

This is very good.  My mom and vavo make this all the time we serve it with Portuguese corn bread.  Living in the city in MASS where just down the street is the Portuguese District area I know my Portuguese food.

This recipe is delicious! I read some people complaining about the lack of salt. It happens because the salted cod fish we buy in USA is not too salt like the original Portuguese one. So, instead of soaking it for 24 hours, try to soak for about 8 to 12 hours and after that time put it in boil water for 5 minutes before use the fish in the recipe.

I could not give this a 5 star rating as I had to alter a few things to the recipe including the time. I used cod filets instead of salted to eliminate as much salt as possible.  I used 3 very large potatoes sliced thinly and 1 very large vidalia onion.  I used a casserole dish and sprayed the bottom before putting my potatoes in so as not to stick to the bottom when baking.  I also drizzled EVO in  between layering this dish. I added 2 can of chickpeas to this dish as I used less potato.  You could also add slices of boiled egg and black olives if you like more variety to this dish.  I grew up with an excellent cook (my mom) and she would make this dish often for my dad.  As for the tomato sauce I used 3/4 cup of spaghetti sauce (Primo) to spread on top of the potatoes.  I covered the whole dish with foil and put it into a 375 oven but needed to add 15 more minutes to ensure the potatoes on top were cooked. After all the changes I made to this recipe it was a really nice tasting dish and I will make it again.

This dish is spectacular!  I was not a huge fish fan until having this dish aka. "Balcalhau". This dish is loaded with flavor, and the smell is awesome.  I like using "Frank's Red Hot" (it's not as hot as Tobasco) sauce in place of the chili peppers and sliced fresh tomatoes in place of the paste. The flavors flow throughout the casserole really well.  Try it with some Portuguese style corn bread....to die for!  :)

We did not enjoy this. I like the idea of layering the potatoes, cod, and onions though. We just didn't like the sauce that you pour on top. Will try again with a different sauce.

I used half the cod, potatoes and onion, but left the sauce ingredients the same.  My Portuguese grandparents loved it- my grandmother said it was a perfect meal for Lent and she asked me for the recipe.  Can't get much better than that.

It didn't come out as well as I had hoped. The cod was very dry and the potatoes took longer than 45 minutes. Had to throw out the leftovers.

This recipe was really great!  It got five stars from my Portuguese husband and his sister.  I did use fresh cod and heavily salted it.  I also used piri piri sauce instead of red pepper flakes.  I'm sure red pepper flakes would have given it a good amount of heat but the Portuguese people in my life live off piri piri peppers/sauce so it had to be subbed.  Thank you so much for sharing!  This will definitely be in the regular rotation!

My husband and I both thought this recipe was great. As some others, I used fresh cod (not salted cod) and still liked the way it came out.  For those who like a saltier taste and are using fresh cod, just salt between the layers as you put the ingredients into the baking dish. Next time I'll use a larger dish. My 7x11 pan was overstuffed!  All of the ingredients were cooked to perfection (not too little/not too much).  I was hesitant to use 3/4 cup of olive oil, but - really - that was not too much.  Thanks for such a nice recipe - something a little different from what I usually make.

John, what a great recipe, thanks for sharing! I was a bit afraid to try a fish casserole, but this turned out wonderful! I used fresh basa (Vietnamese catfish) and pretty much followed the recipe from there. Yummmmm! I served a fresh spinach salad with this and got rave reviews from my boyfriend. Thanks again John!

it was a little too plain for me so I made changes and had to cook longer for the potatoes.
I added white wine so the potatoes had something to soak up, I used smoked paprika, added salt and sprinkled with FF mozzarella cheese once it came out of the oven. Then we loved it!

I am American and my husband is Portuguese. I am always looking for meal to make my husband that would remind him of Portugal. He LOVED this one and bragged to his buddies at the café how his American wife cooks very good Portuguese food. The best compliment came from my in-laws. I soak my cod fish for two days, otherwise it's too salty and I do not add any additional salt. This is easy and soooo yummy!!!

This is really good. We didn't have salted cod, we used frozen and let it soak for an hour to defrost with some salted water.  We skipped the potatoes and doubled the onions and garlic. Very tasty. Made the day before and reheated in a covered  frying pan. Great after soaking up flavor for the day.

I made some changes to fit what is in my kitchen but wish I didn't have to. I used mashed potatoes on top, garlic powder, and the whole 4oz can of tomato sauce. I used fresh cod instead of salted and diced hablono peppers instead of red flakes. STILL amazing!!!!

I didn't have salted cod, just fresh cod. It would have been good I think if there wasn't so much oil and I had added salt to it - but as i'm trying to watch my sodium ...this didn't work for me. Im giving it 4 stars because I think if i'd added salt, it would have rated that but even if I had it was too much oil...

Very easy and very good. I might add some parmesan and herbs next time for more depth and flavour.

We love baked cod and are always looking for new ways to prepare. I followed others suggestions and used fresh cod, skipped the potatoes because we are on a low carb diet and halved the red pepper (personal taste). I added salt to the sauce since this was not salted cod that I was using.I left out the paprika because I didn't have any on hand. Even before cooking,I found the sauce to be wonderful. We are tempted to use it alone as a dipping sauce,very yummy!
I did add pitted black olives at the end since this is the way our local Portuguese restaurant serves this. Will definately make again and highly recommend! Thanks for a great recipe!

One of the many, many Portuguese recipes for salt cod.  I have read complaints that it does not have much taste!!! - you really need to use salt cod because it has a very special flavor.   I only gave it a 4 rating because I prefer salt cod cooked with cream (natas), but that is a matter of taste.

Thank you for such a tasty and easy recipe......I really loved this dish as did the rest of the family however I did use more tomatoe sauce (homemade), and the next time I make it less olive oil, other than that it was delicious!! Thanks again I will be making this dish again.

I agree with someone else who posted that really this doesn't have much taste to it.  I didn't use salted cod as the recipe calls for, but I can't imagine salt bringing out what was missing.

You may need to make some changes to the amounts of ingredients, but it’s a great recipe overall.

I didn't have salt cod I had tilapia so used that instead.  Next time I will partially cook the potatoes and onions first. Also I would add a little more garlic and only 1 tsp of the pepper flakes.I also added salt since I didn't use salted cod. Other then that it was a hit.

OMGosh!! I don’t really like onions or fish but I’m eating a Mediterranean diet so I gave this a shot based on reviews. Can I just say, Amazing!  I used fresh cod because I didn’t have salted cod so I just salted the filets. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a really good 4 star recipe as it stands, but I had to tweak it with a few other ingredients to put it up to five star status.  In a skillet, I  sautéed white mushrooms until I got the water out, added extra onions to the skillet, then a red bell pepper and some Tony's cajun seasoning.  Then I turned off the heat, and threw in some halved cherry tomatoes, a can of artichoke hearts cut into pieces, and the remnants of a jar of both capers and kalamata olives (about half a cup combined) before adding a can of chopped tomatoes, a half cup of red wine and two tablespoons of Heinz ketchup to cut the acidity (I've long stopped using brown sugar to even out acidity in all manners of tomato sauces even though I don't otherwise use ketchup).  I poured this mixture over the layers of potatoes and cod (regular, not salt cod) and baked it for 25 minutes. Then I pulled it out, pulled off the tin foil, and sprinkled crispy onions mixed with some breadcrumbs over the top, and put it back in the oven for another 7-8 minutes.   Outstanding!!

I've made this quite a few times now. As others suggested, I used frozen/freshe cod instead of salted. It comes out wonderful. My family loves it!

I used frozen cod.  Not salted. just defrosted.  A little less than the recipe so I cut the ingredients some.  I added another tablespoon of tomato sauce and a couple drops of Habanero sauce.  Awesome.  I might make the sauce thicker by using more tomato sauce,,,,

I used dill instead of parsley and picante instead of tomato sauce.  I think next time I will top it with zucchini instead of the potatoes since the top ones were a bit under-cooked while the bottom ones were a bit over-cooked.  This would allow me to bake it for about half an hour and I believe that would be better.

My husband and I both liked the dish.  I did not have salted cod, so I just salted each layer of the potatoes.  This is a keeper.
