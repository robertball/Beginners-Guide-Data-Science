Thanks for making nachos on chicken a legit recipe! I've been making it for years but my girlfriend thinks I'm just being lazy and disgusting. I showed her this recipe and was like, in your face! Now please do the same for potato chips and onion dip, buttered popcorn, and chewing tobacco.

I made something similar to this the other night. I had only medium salsa on hand which was a little to spicy for my grandson. I had to add cream cheese to the dish to cut down on the heat, which actually turned out to be wonderful ! With the way its done in this version, I have the option of using mild, medium, or hot ! This is also a great way to get rid of those tortilla chips that I don't want to go to waste in the cupboard ! Also if you season the chicken with salt and pepper first and sprinkle it with taco seasoning, its even better !! Thanks for the recipe !

It was quick and delicious. My kids loved it, besides my two pickiest eaters. I added black olives cut in half on top of the salsa because my kids love olives. Nice and easy, will make again.

Super easy and great! Pleasantly surprised at how tasty it turned out! Great for beginning "chefs" (and I use that term loosely!) and college students etc.!

My Wife just made this for me & all I can say is it's one of the best chicken dishes we've ever had.  she used trader joes salsa and white corn tortilla chips with a little guacamole on top. Delicious!

Pretty satisfying! I added some chopped tomato and avocado slices with cheese during the last ten minutes of baking time, which ended up making this recipe a little bit more filling & tasty to me.

We couldn't grill chicken last night due to rain so I searched and found this recipe.  It's a yummy alternative to breaded baked chicken and was easier to prepare.  We'll definitely be making this again with sweet chili chips (instead of plain tortilla chips) and a little hot sauce with the salsa.
