I'm in love! I browned the chicken ( topped with a bit of salt,  pepper and garlic pwdr)  in garlic olive oil. I went with the standard white sauce steps....melted butter and EVOO to deglazed the pan, mixed in flour, then added cream. Tossed in lavender flowers and mozzarella (and like a T leftover ricotta). Simmered for a few minutes and burned my finger tasting it!  Thank you for sharing!

Yum. Quite tasty and super easy. Some modifications.  Used leftover rotisserie chicken. Used milk with a little extra butter instead of cream. Instead of all mozzarella, used some leftover asiago and parmesan for more salt. Also added some rosemary.

In my opinion, two tablespoons of lavender is too much, next time I'll cut it down to one. I also had to add about 2 cups of milk to thin the sauce out a bit.

For all of the simplicity this rivals a gourmet meal. I chose to use homemade fusilli pasta and grill my chicken. To give a cleaner look I did not toss the sauce with the pasta or chicken.  I will absolutely make this again!!!

Creamy, delicious pasta dish. instead of using actual lavender I used 2 drops lavender essential oil. I really like this because it's a good break from the norm and easy to make!

Wonderful and so easy.  I added 2 minced cloves of garlic when cooking the chicken.

We love this recipe. We are big fans of lavender here!!!. I used fresh lavender and the flavor was great, not to strong but very enjoyable.

First, you HAVE to like the taste of lavender to love this recipe, and I do! This would be wonderful for Spring, and I used dried lavender buds but fresh would add a more subtle flavor. Thanks for the recipe!
