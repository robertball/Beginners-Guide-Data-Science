Super easy to make and it doesn't call for a lot of ingredients.  This is a very unique recipe.  I made mine with half and half instead of milk for a creamyer texture.  It was delicious my whole family loved it!  I will be making this many more times.

This recipe came out great. I made two pies and used hazelnut creamer and milk. Very creamy but not runny. It set up nicely in the fridge. Now my wife says I have to make it for her from now on on special occasions and the holidays.

This was very good. I used half and half instead of milk. Although I think if I made it again I would add a smidge of allspice in the mix and use a little less cornstarch as it was a bit too firm for my liking. Great recipe.

Loved it! Never had this pie before but looked interesting. It's like rice pudding with out the rice. But I added a pinch of cinnamon to the milk and sprinkled the pie with nutmeg and cinnamon. Good stuff.

Really a lovely pie.  Easy to make and nice taste.  I have never had anything like this before.  Not rich but a nice creamy texture. Going to try a graham cracker crust next time or cookie crust just to add alittle different flavor.

This was amazing! Can't wait to make again and try adding different flavors.  I made with half/half, it was creamy goodness!!!!
