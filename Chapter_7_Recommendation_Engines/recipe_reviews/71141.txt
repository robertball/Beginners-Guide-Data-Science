I like Morocca food, but this recipe is a little disappointing. The concept behind this recipe is great; the excecution is not. First, it takes a lot longer than about 45 min-1hr to peel and dice so many tubers, not 1/2 an hour. Second, 9 hours is so long that the vegetables get overcooked. Third, there's so little broth that you run the risk of eating steamed vegetables rather than stewed ones. For the amount of vegetables, there's not enough spice, so it comes out rather bland. My suggestions: less cooking time by an hour or two, double the spice and the broth (or mix in a second set of spices after you finish cooking), use only 3/4 lbs of each tuber and increase the amount of dried fruit. I suppose suggesting using chicken broth or adding meat would be a travesty, but it would help make it more flavorful.

I read the reviews carefully before i made this. In addition to doubling the spices, the dried fruits and the liquid, I used white yams instead of using turnips, which added another sweet vegetable.  I also reduced cooking time ti 6.5 hours on low and toasted a mix of regular and buckwheat couscous to go with it. 

The other addition that I recommend (suggested by a friend who ate this dish and also spent time in Morocco) is hot sauce to taste, which can be added once the dish is served.

A day later, the leftovers tasted even better!

This was good!  I made it as suggested with double the amount of fruits, spices and broth.  I cut out the turnips (personal preference) and added a can of chick peas.  We added hot sauce and served it with couscous and a salad.  I felt like I was back in Morocco.  Even my non-vegan husband thought it was yummy.

I do agree with some of the reviewers that this needs more time in preparation but I found the cooking time to be about right (depends on your slow cooker. Also, the spices need adjusting and more salt is needed.  Try using as many fresh spices as you can find (instead of powdered) and make sure the liquid covers the vegetables plus an inch or so. Using whole wheat couscous adds a nice taste also. This has become a "regular" dish at my house as it can be adjusted for spice levels and whatever root vegetables you can find at the greengrocer's. Nice introduction to North African flavours.

I have lived in Morocco and this brought back the most wonderful memories of Moroccan food at its best! It's worth the extra time. My family has never tried the food since we don't live in an area that serves Moroccan food. They absolutely loved it. My finicky son asked that I cook it twice a month!

I made this for dinner earlier this week.  As per recommendation I increased the liquid and double the seasoning amounts.  I made the broth in 3:1 proportion, but 2.5 or 2:1 would probably work better next time.  I didn't have turnips but did have sweet potatoes, so I used one large sweet potato and about 1/2 to 3/4 lb carrots and parsnips.  I didn't have dried apricots, but had raisins instead so I did that with the prunes.  For time constraints I cooked it on high for 3 and a half hours.  Turned out great and I'd definitely make this again!!!

This needed salt, and could have used a lot more dried apricots and prunes.  I added a few more of each and wish i had tripled or quadrupled the fruit.  you couldn't taste it in the finished product.  But the flavorings and seasoning was terrific.  Served it with couscous that I toasted in a dry skillet first.  Gave it a nice nutty flavor.

Do not cook this for 9 hours!  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and it would have been fine being cooked for just 3 hours.  I added diced Yukon Gold potatoes and two tablespoons of peach jam instead of the dried apricots and prunes.  I also added fresh cilantro and parsley tossed in at the end rather than dried.  I served with a curried rice pilaf and topped it with french fried onion pieces.  It was very tasty.

Being a vegetarian, I pretty much love all vegetables. And I am no stranger to Moroccan, Indian, or other spicy foods. But something about this combination of veggies and spices was FUNKY. I dare say it had sort of a "bile" flavor. I followed the directions very carefully too.

Usually, I relly enjoy Moroccan food... but this was not good!  I think it was the combination of the fragrant turnips and parsnips with all the spices.

This was good. I cooked it slowly on the stovetop, not in a slow cooker. I omitted the prunes (I didn't have any) and substitited some raisins. I needed to add about twice the stock. I also added boneless chicken breast pieces and made kind of a stew of it. Thanks for the recipe.

Hubby liked this; I didn't. We both thought it was missing something, however. For me, this combo of veggies just didn't work with these spices. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I doubled the spices, fruit, and broth. Although the consensus among reviewers seems to be that 4-5 hrs. is the ideal cook time, mine took 4 hrs. on low and another 2.5 on high. Great idea, but I'm not planning to make this again.

I halved the amount of vegetables (used sweet potatoes as I didn't have turnips)but left everything else the same except I added salt. I also added some diced chuck steak. Only took 7 hours in my slow cooker. The result was delicious, a sort of Moroccan 'curry'. YUM. Thanks for sharing.

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added more broth (chicken) and doubled the fruit and spices. Everything else remained the same. I usually love morroccan food and flavor, but this didn't take; It still seemed bland and unappetizing. No suggestions for improvement, I won't be making this one again.

deeeelicious!  I followed the recipe fairly true to form, except substituted a scant teaspoon of harisa for the cayenne.  
The only drawback was that the parsnips and turnips didn't fare so well as leftovers; the texture got a bit too sloppy for my liking.  Otherwise a hearty and divine meal, thank you!

I did not cook it 9 hours and it was still overcooked and starting to get mushy. I didn't have any apricots (I added some preserves to try to get some flavor of it though) I thought it was pretty good side dish, easy, inexpensive easy to find ingredients.

Took some liberty with this recipe by leaving out the parsnips and turnips as per others' opinions and as I didn't have them on hand. Still delicious and I got raves for this recipe. Thanks!

I carefully read reviews before making this recipe as I've never made anything like it before. I took some suggestions from other reviews and did a few other things differently. It came out quite good!

I have a smaller crock pot so I ended up using 1/2 of a large parsnip, 4 large carrots, 2 large white sweet potatoes, 1 large white onion and added apricots, prunes and dates.

For spices, I doubled the amount in the recipe and also added a hint of cardamom, fresh ginger (and a little of the ground) as well as a hint of curry powder. I used 2 vegetable boulion cubes and added water to about 1/2 inch above the mixture, (don't let the photo fool you-it's the before pic). I tossed all of the ingredients in a larger dish before cooking to ensure even flavor. After about 4 hours of stewing on low, this dish was extremely fragrant and tasty. I think with this recipe is very simple and versatile. I served it with white basmati rice-delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  I didn't have the time to cook it in the crock pot so it went in the oven.  I used raisens instead of the apricots and prunes.  I had it for breakfast this morning.  Better the next day! I will make this frequently and often.

This was good! My bf enjoyed it, and my daughter picked at it - I think just because it was a bit spicy, she ate mostly cous cous. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

my friends & i loved this!  we had a non-traditional thanksgiving this year & this was an excellent side dish. i kept stirring about every 45 minutes to evenly coat all the spices (which i doubled) & noticed it was ready after just 4.5 hours, so i turned it to 'warm' for the remaining 3 hours i'd allocated.  next time, i will add more fruit, but not much.  it is excellent served over toasted couscous.

This is really quite tasty. I doubled all of the spices except for the cayenne, used a whole 28 oz box of vegetable broth, and cooked it on low for at least 9 hours. Hubby loved it so much that the changes have been added to my "custom version" so I don't have to remember what I did when it's time to make it again!

Quite good and very adaptable. It is a great starting point for a tagine if you have lots of firm veggies to use up (I used parsnips, turnips, carrots, and spaghetti squash--any winter squash or potatoes would also be good).  

I cooked at 350F for an hour in the oven and it was perfect.

I double the seasonings, as suggested by others.  And I used sun dried tomatoes and raisins instead of apricots (I'm sure any dried fruit will be great). I also thought it could you a sprinkle of salt and a squeeze of lemon after cooking.

This is a great base with which to get creative. I doubled the spices and the broth as suggested. Also added a sweet potato, dried cranberries and siracha sauce and some honey for kick and sweetness. I used the excess sauce from the slow cooker to make the cous cous. Rave reviews from a vegan and two carnivores. Although one did say it would be great with some steak in it :)

Good as main dish or as side dish...
Highly adaptable as a 'base' to add 
cooked beef, lamb or chicken...

This was pretty tasty! All eight of us enjoyed this one and will make it again. On the plus side, it was fairly easy to throw together too.

Very good, tasted similar to some of the best Moroccan restaurants I have been to in North America.

I agree with previous commentors.  I increased the amount of fruit, both dried apricots and dates, and still did not detect a fruity taste in the finished dish.   I also increased the amount of liquid used and used fresh ginger and cilantro.  I added a can of chickpeas.  The balance of the different ingredients needs some tweaking, but overall I liked the spice profile and will try this dish again.

Before making this, I read a number of the reviews and doubled the spices as recommended. I also tripled the apricots and substituted dates (also tripled)  for prunes. 
I used sweet potatoes instead of turnips because I do not care for turnips. My slow cooker was not large enough to accommodate all of these vegetables so I cooked this very very slowly in a large pan on top of the stove. When ready, I served the veggies over quinoa. The result was amazing! Such a flavorful one dish meal. My guests are still talking about it!! BTW: When I make this again, I will not double the cayenne pepper. It was too hot for my wife.

As some others have mentioned on here, I doubled the spices, added diced fennel, zest and juice of a small orange, zest and juice of a small lemon and a can of chick peas (garbanzo beans).  
I measured out all my spices into a bowl and mixed them thoroughly.
I place all the veg in the pot then stir in a tablespoon of tomato paste, then stir in the spices a little at a time ensuring an even coating throughout.
Lastly adding in the liquids but careful not to wash off the spice coating.
Cook on high for one hour and low for five hours, never removing the lid.
Served it with quinoa, flavoured with lemon juice and black pepper.

While I enjoyed the recipe, I was a bit disappointed, the fruits hardly tasted sweet after stewing all day. If I make it again I'd prob add more or add more near the end or after it's done cooking.

I also made the full serving for all week meals and got bored of it after eating it twice so I won't be making it for myself again.

I didn't particularly like this, but it's the first time I had eaten parsnips or turnips. Admittedly, not in my flavor profile.

This is tasty, easy and healthy.  I used the reviewer's suggestions to double the spices (except the cinnamon) and I tripled the fruit. It could be made super fabulous with a little extra work, though.  Next time I will use fresh ginger, saute it in some good olive oil and then add the spices for about 5 minutes so the flavors really develop.  I will also roast the root veggies with the onions in the oven so they get good flavor as well.  In addition I would use fresh cilantro and parsley.

my girlfriend made this recipe last week and at first we enjoyed it but found it very difficult to eat with all the fibrous vegetables.  we were exhausted after eating bowl and found it a tad too sweet As well.  I should mention that we cooked it for eight hours and doubled the broth and spices as per the reviews. But what really made this recipe kick is when we decided to purée it. This brought out much more of the spices that are trapped inside the vegetables and made it easier to digest. All it needs is a piece of cornbread. love it!

i listened to the reviews of adding more spice to prevent blandness, but meh - this recipe really misses something.  Its edible but I would not make again.

I followed the recipe to the T and it was NOT a crowd pleaser- It says something when I didn't even like it...

A great change of pace from our usual veggie meals.
