I thought it was a little heavy on the graham crackers and will put more than half in the crust than on top.  It was a hit at my company potluck!

I loved these, and so did my dad and everyone at the party I catered with these. They had just the right nix of sweetness, tartness, and butteryness. I make these often, and they're always a big hit.

I love how easy this is, I substituted the filling for lemon pie filling and it was fantastic.

These were so very simple and delectable.  I even forgot to grease my pan, but the butter in the crust seems to suffice.  The filling is thin and doesn't goosh out; the lemon taste is just right.

I can't imagine why anyone would not give this 5 stars.  This was apsolutely delicious, and one of the easiest desserts I ever made.  I had company over and needed something quick and easy.  Plus I needed it to have ingredients that I would always have on hand.  This fit the bill!  I did not put crumbles on top.  Maybe that is why I did not have a problem with all of the crust.  Next time, I may just drizzle the top with raspberry sauce.  Mmmm.

Great lemony taste. Not so great for eye appeal. If I saw them on a treat tray I probably wouldnt pick them, but taste makes up for it! Cut graham cracker amount by at least 1/2 cup. Too much is called for in this recipe.

I thought the taste was a little bland.  My kids weren't crazy about them.  However, they were easy to make.

I wanted to LOVE these but they didn't set-up right and the graham cracker crumbs are just falling all over the place. I will maybe try these again and try to figure out what went wrong.  I didn't have a 9 inch square so I used an 8 inch square... I didn't think that would make a big difference but maybe it did.

The recipe was amazing the first day.. The second day, I think the graham cracker topping weighed down the lemon squares too much and made them much more monotonous tasting. I would definitely make these again, only with less graham cracker crust.

I got this recipe out of Reminisce magazine a few years ago.  They are heavenly and so easy to make.  Next time I'm going to add coconut and see how that tastes.

I was really excited for these since I LOVE graham cracker crumbs, but having made these I'm with the reviewers who stated there is too much of it in these bars. These would be 5 stars with just a bit less crumbs. Otherwise, delicious recipe.

Sweet, oh my word this is sweet. I had to eat mine with a cup of milk. I used vegetable oil in place of the butter. Seemed to work okay, except the crust may have been a bit too crumbly. The brown sugar might not be necessary as this dessert is super sweet. A dollop of whipped topping would round it out nicely. Seems to keep well in the fridge.

These were a hit! I was looking for a simple lemon square recipe, and this did the trick! The graham cracker really lends itself to this recipe- I didn't really like lemon squares before making these. Great lemon taste.

These were amazing! Thank you for your comments, because I used them to tweak my dish and was very pleased!
I used an 8x8 glass dish vs the 9 and it did not affect it. 
I also only used 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs that I crumbled up myself. Then, after making the crumb mixture, I used 2/3 of it for the bottom of the dish, and the remaining 1/3 on top of the lemon mixture.
I used fresh lemons for the lemon mixture, but didn't realize how much little juice they produced. I'd say have at least 3 big lemons on hand if you want to get 1/2 cup of lemon juice out of them.
Serve the squares with some whipped topping and /or vanilla ice cream, and you've got a hit!
