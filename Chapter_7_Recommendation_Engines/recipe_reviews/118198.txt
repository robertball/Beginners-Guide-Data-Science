A quick and easy meal...I'd actually give it a 4.5 rating.  I made some changes including doubling the garlic, using Creole seasoning instead of salt, substituting red pepper flakes for the pepper, using cream of mushroom soup and using fresh mushroom.  With the leftovers, I plan on using another reviewer's recommendation of serving it over noodles.  I'll likely make this one again!

I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars, as it's missing something. I'm just not altogether sure what. I found that mine didn't bake up like a casserole, which is what I thought it would be. I think that next time, I might make it with a cheddar or colby jack cheese, and add rice and some extra water to it before I put it in the oven. I did use fresh spinach instead of frozen. It was good. My boyfriend loved it.

Wow!  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  Yummy.  I prepared according to the recipe, w/minor alterations:  I used fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup instead of yucky cream of celery.  I did not add cheese to the top, as it seemed cheesy enough.  I can't believe I'm typing this, but when I make it again (and I will!) I will actually decrease the amount of cheese.  I'm always looking to cut out a few calories and it was so plentiful I'm sure I could reduce the amount w/out altering the taste.  Thanks for a great weeknight meal!

Yummy! Creamy, rich taste. I kept sneaking back into the kitchen for more little bites after dinner was over. Also tasted great heated in the microwave the next day. I used fresh mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe was just there for me. I am usually a fan of hot dishes, growing up in the midwest. I felt like it was just kinda of like slop. Also, I felt it didnt need the cheese. There wasnt too much body to the flavor either. Lastly, my boyfriend didnt like and he is usally a human garbage disposal!

I had to change the recipe because I didn't have all the ingredients. I left out the mushrooms and sour cream. I added about 2 cups of cooked macaroni. I used 20oz or fresh chopped spinach. All other steps and ingredients were the same. It was VERY good and very easy to make.

This is one of the first dishes I made from here and I have made it several times.  It was in the rotation for this evening, and as I am thinking about it, I was thinking it could use a little something extra, like pasta.  So I came here to read the reviews and low and behold, others suggested pasta also.  I try very hard to  make the recipes as written, at least the first time in order to give it a fair review rather than creating a whole new recipe that is unrecognizable from the original, and it is very good as written.  I must say that I do like my addition of pasta (bowties) and omission of 1 of the spinaches.  I also added just a shake or two of Wor. Sauce this time.  I also didnt add the cheese on top thinking that would be a good place to save a few calories, fat, yada yada.  I also need to remember that my skillet is NEVER large enough to add everything in together.  I always have to use another bowl to mix before adding to my sprayed oven pan.  You could probably mix in the oven pan, but I like to spray all my pans for easier clean up.  As I am pouring the mix into the oven pan, I am wondering why I even bake it.  I like to straight out of the mixing bowl, and if I used a larger skillet, I could make it all on the stove in one pan and it is perfectly creamy and yummy.  So I might do that next time since I dont need to bake the cheese on the top if I leave it off.

Pretty good but I had to add some milk to thin it down, it was super thick and sticky after adding the cheese. I also added some cooked egg noodles before baking to make it a little more hearty. While we were eating we thought it was good but needed something so we all stirred in some Worcestersire and that did the trick. Will probably make again with the egg noodles, milk and worcestershire.

Loved it!!!  Left out mushrooms and substituted Cream of chicken instead of cream of celery soup.  I also put in some grated zucchini instead of 1 of the packs of spinach.  It turned out wonderful.

I also used cream of mushroom soup and used fresh spinach as here in SA we don't get frozen spinach (only creamed).  If you use fresh spinach, be sure to drain the water off before adding the cream and soup.  But definitely a keeper! Everyone came back for seconds!

This was actually really good.  I used fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach and cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery.  I found the recipe when searching for recipes using ingredients that I had on hand that I needed to cook up asap.  It was a nice suprise and my family all enjoyed it.

very good.  i would make it again.
  note1: i couldn't find cream of celery without MSG so used cream of mushroom. i think i should have left out the can of mushroom pieces.
  note2: ground buffalo was on sale so i used it instead of beef. very tastey.

I found this using an ingredient search for ground beef and spinach. I substituted fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms, and cheddar cheese because I had them in the fridge. The flavor was great, but needs some substance. I spooned it over brown rice, and everyone seemed to like it (no leftovers). Next time, I might add pasta to the mixture as others suggested.

This was a great dish, and so easy.  I, too, substituted a cream of mushroom soup.  It was delicious and my husband and son loved it.  It is, obviously, very spinach-y though, so if you're not sure how you feel about spinach, you may want to try another dish first.

You have to really like spinach to eat this. My boyfriend thought this had way too much spinach. If I make it again, I will use one package.

I had reservations when I pulled this out of the oven, but my husband LOVED it.  He declared it a keeper and asked that I put it in the regular "dinner rotation".  Thanks for posting this!  (I did have to improvise as we had no mushrooms; only had fresh spinach so I wilted it with bacon & garlic first; used Cajun seasoning instead of oregano; only had Mexican blend cheese so used that.  Still, the original recipe was a great foundation from which to work.)

I did not like this recipe at all!  The flavor was too salty/cheesy even though I used fat free cheese and the texture was strange.  It would have been better on top of noodles.  It was easy and cheap to make, however.

I made a few alterations to this.  I used 4 garlic cloves and 2 onions carmalized first then added beef.  Also used fresh spinach.  Cheese was mozz/provolone mix.  Tasted it before baking and it seemed a little bland so I added a can of diced tomatoes/green chilies.  WOW!  was really good served on buttered shell pasta!  Hubby loved it.  I did too.  Only 4 stars cause kids not so much.  Complained all the way through.  *sigh*  no matter, just means more for us as leftovers!  :)

I thought this was yummy.  I did make the following changes since I didn't have all the ingredients:  1) used ground turkey instead of beef 2)mixed 1/2 bag of cooked egg noodles in before I baked it  3)generously added red pepper flakes  4)used about a cup of shredded cheddar instead of mozzarella since it was all I had  5)used only half the amount of spinach and sour cream  6) some artichoke hearts instead of shrooms    It was easy and tasty.

I know how people hate when others change the recipe but oh well! you will get over it! My guy didn't care for this but my 15 month old & i did. I live in the country & used ingredients i had on hand. Fresh mushrooms instead of canned & roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup. Also only had canned tomatoes & chiles (rotel) which i thought gave it a little more flavor that would have been lacking. Next time i will try cubed chicken instead of the ground turkey i used. All in all it was perfect for my son & that is why it's a keeper.
