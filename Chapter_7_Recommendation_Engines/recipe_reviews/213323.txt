Good base recipe, very easy to prepare.  However I found it a little bland as written so I added some garlic, green pepper, and S & P with the beef to add some flavor and then added macaroni and corn to make it a full meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was bland and not very good. We had it with salad and for once my kid went back for seconds on the salad just to not eat more of this soup. Maybe some more cheese or something would make it better but with so many other recipes for similair soups I think I will trash it and start with them instead

I added garlic and seasoned beef while cooking. I also added potatoes. Very hearty: will make again
