Wow - these definitely are "Amazing Spicy Grilled Shrimp"!!! If you like things spicy these are for you - if you tend to shy away from a little heat don't bother. I used Frank's Red Hot as my hot sauce (no way I was going to use 2 Tbsp. of tabasco as others had - that's just over the top burn you mouth off in my opinion). You can also adjust the amount of hot sauce and chile paste if you like. I didn't change a thing and thought these were great! I squeezed a bit of fresh lemon juice on them when they came off the grill - a definite keeper!

Wow! Quite possibly the best shrimp I've ever made. Instead of hot sauce and chili paste, I just used some SriRaCha (Thai hot sauce). A little spicy for the kids but I tried to turn it down a little by adding more lemon juice. Also, instead of parsley, I used cilantro. Grilled on perforated grill sheet so the shrimp stayed a little saucy. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for the first time for a holiday party. I made 4 dozen. We had only 15 people show up for the party. Along with ham, turkey and all the other fixings, my shrimp was the only thing that was platter licked clean!! I think they even licked off the lettuce that I served the shrimp on! I changed the recipe a very little. did not have any Asian chili sauce on hand so I used Szechwan sauce instead. I placed everything in a plastic bag and put in the fridge for about 45minutes to an hour. I then placed them on the grill on foil till hot. (just took a couple of minutes) I served with 3 different dipping sauces from a hot one to a sweet one. I have never had so many people wanting the recipe and Hubby has been bugging me to make more and it has been only a week since the party!!

Wow, wow, wow!!  This was good!  We made these over the weekend for our son's b-day party.  They were a major hit.  I tripled the recipe and I followed the recipe pretty exactly except I reduced the lemon juice because I only had a lime and I used cilantro instead of parsley.  It tasted great and not so spicey that the kids couldn't enjoy them too.  I marinated them overnight...delicious!  While my husband and I were putting them on kabobs, we actually put aside some for us and sauteed them in olive oil because they smelled so good.  They were delicious!! My husband says this is the only way we'll make them going forward.  Thanks for this recipe.

OMGosh!  Truly an amazing recipe!  I couldn't find asian chile paste so I just omitted it.  I also read to add the lemon for the last 30 minutes of the marination to keep the shrimp from getting tough.  So I did that plus I followed the grilling time to the second and the shrimp were wonderfully tender and so so flavorful.  I used Tabasco for my hot sauce and the amount of spice was perfect.  Really really good recipe!

This recipe is good, but as written it is very very spicy.  I used tabasco as my hot sauce and after putting 1 tablespoon in I tasted it and it didn't seem that hot so I added the other.  I wish I had only added the one.  I like it spicey, but my kids only like it a little spicey.  I also used sirachi (thai chili sauce) because I didn't have chinese.  Other than that, I made the recipe as stated.  I will try this again for sure, but not use as much tabasco.

I marinated pre-cooked shrimp for a couple of days, threaded them on skewers and heated them through, 1 minute per side, on the George Foreman.  We liked the heat and tasty combination of flavors.  Served with take out fried rice and grilled yellow squash.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I made this to impress my new boyfriend's buddies while they were watching their NFL games and I earned major points!  Based on suggestions I used Sriracha for hot sauce and Lee Kum Kee Chille Garlic Sauce for Asian chile paste.  Also added a tablespoon of sugar just in case the shrimp turned out too spicy or salty.  Because I don't have a grill I cooked half the shrimp on a pam sprayed pan at low heat, and the other half was skewered and cooked in oven at 350 degrees.  Both turned out great although I preferred the pan cooked a little more.  Definitely will be making this again for another party.

Excellent flavor! We like it hot, so for the hot sauce, I used 1 tablespoon of regular Tabasco and the 2nd tablespoon  Habanero Tabasco. Absolutely perfect!

I discovered this receipe last summer and I love it. Its my go to meal when I have friends over or when I need a quick meal.  The sesame oil gives it a nice flavor. I try to let it marinade for at least 30 minutes. Cooked on th grill is the best.

These are really good - but mine were just a little TOO spicy (and I love heat). It probably depends a lot on what kind of hot sauce and chili paste you use - next time I'll be a little more conservative. Also, I used EZ-peel jumbo shrimp for this - worked fine! Thanks for the recipe!

I scaled this recipe to 3 servings and let marinade for 45 minutes. My son decided to add a few drops of *atomic* hot sauce to the marinade to make it really HOT!!!  Placed them on the smoker for 6 minutes total cooking time.  Will make again.

This was absolutely amazing.  I followed the recipe ingredients pretty much exactly, except that I reduced the hot pepper sauce (I used Tabasco) to one tablespoon.  For the Asian chile paste, I used Lee Kum Kee Chile Garlic Sauce, which I found in the international area of the supermarket.  I marinated the shrimp with a cup of washed and sliced mushrooms for about a half hour, then I added the shrimp, mushrooms, and marinade to a pan with frozen stir fry vegetables and let everything cook for about a half hour.  I served it over white rice.  This is absolutely delicious and I'm definitely going to make it again.

I love this recipe!  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the recipe tells you to marinate the shrimp for too long.  The first time I made this I only had 20 or 30 minutes to marinate it and it was awesome!  The second time I marinated it the full 2 hours and the lemon juice began to partially cook the shrimp, making the shrimp tough and chewy once grilled.  So follow the recipe, but only marinate for about 30 minutes and this recipe truly is amazing.

Ok. I have never reviewed a recipe on this or any other site, but this one takes the cake. Spend the extra money for un-cooked shelled shrimp and don't mess with the recipe. Absolutely like eating the best tiny lobster you will ever eat. I will cook this another thousand times. Thank you.

I gave this 3 stars because, although I didn't like it, my bf did.  I just didn't not like the sesame oil.  I even used less than called for.

Fantastic! I used 1 TBSP of hot sauce because I wanted my kids to eat them.  Otherwise I would have used 2.

Wonderful marinade, not too spicy for my wimpy husband. I did use my sweeter chili sauce, I didn't add a whole 1/4 cup of sesame oil, that stuff is pretty strong flavored and expensive, so I just put in enough for the flavoring. The marinade tasted so good that we made more and used it for our vegetables we were grilling also.

My family and friends love this. If you don't want to put them on skewers, cook them in a saute pan...you don't need to add any oil. They turn out moist and it's less work.

Delicious!  I couldn't grill because of the weather so I just threw it all marinade and all, into a frying pan and they gobbled it up.  I would recommend if you do end up cooking it inside like I had to, to serve it with some rice or noodles.

Really awesome recipe. I'm not a huge fan of sesame oil, so cut that back a bit and added a t of hot sesame oil, and we were late getting started so the shrimp only marinated a few minutes, but it was fantastic.

My wife found this marinade and after reading the reviews made several changes.  Since we like spicy she used sriracha hot sauce and cilantro in place of just plain hot sauce and parsley.  It was awesome.  With the left over marinade I used it as a salad dressing on a small salad just to try it out and it was perfect......  If you like a spicy taste to your meal I would recommend everyone try this marinade.  By the way the wooden skewers didn't work very well with the salad......

I just made these and they were great! I used a cayenne pepper sauce for my hot sauce. I have a gigantic tub of gochujang in my fridge, so I'm always glad to be able to use that, too. I didn't change anything cutting the recipe in half because I didn't have much shrimp. I only wish I'd made more, because they were delicious. I also used my leftover marinade as a dipping sauce for veggies and brushed it on pork.

This was perfect, just enough taste without becoming overpowering or hiding the taste of the shrimp.  Also very easy.  We left it to marinade overnight (for convenience) and it had no ill effect.  In fact I would plan on leaving it overnight.

I sauteed the shrimp in a skillet and served over salad with the cooked marinade as dressing.  I only had about an hour to marinade so I used the full amount of hot sauce despite other reviewers commenting that it was a little too spicy.  This came together quickly, everyone loved it, and clean up was a breeze.  I can't wait to make this again on the grill!

Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out delicious.  I don't have a BBQ, so I used an oven grill and baked them.  Very moist and buttery!

This was so awesome!!! Thanks for sharing!! Mi hubby loved it although he thought it wasn´t spicy at all but that is a personal preference of course. The thing which I did diferently was that since I don´t have a place to grill I just sauteed the shrimp in bacon fat.

So fantastic!!!  Will make this again and again!  I was out of sesame oil, so I just skipped it, but didn't increase the olive oil.  We didn't miss it.  Loved this marinade so much, that we're going to try it on chicken skewers too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made as directed.  I usually wouldn't use a recipe with "ketchup" as an ingredient but I thought I'd give it a try.  Just so so.  They did have a nice spicy zing to them

I hate to comment bad on something that is SO beloved by AR users! So with all due respect, this was just 'all right' for us. I actually had it marinating for 5 hours. the marinade is a BEAUTIFUL looking blend with the red and green contrast. However the taste was just ok. I recomend a more simple trick, go on line and purchase the BEST hot sauce on the planet - it is called "valleydoll" and you can order it and have it shipped to you from teh Virgin Islands. I mix a little of it with olive oil / salt / pepper - to create the most dramatic awesome tasting grilled shrimp! and it's SO EASY! it's worth the shipping cost! If you try it you will thank me latter. Happy eatting!

Amazing! I used cilantro & lime rather than lemon and parsley due to what I had on hand. Served with grilled asparagus and Jasmine rice. It was a great Valentine dinner.

I find this to be one of  the best marinades for shrimp that I have ever tried.  The only change I made is I use cilantro (fresh) instead of the parsley, and marinate longer than the two hours.....I have made it several times now and have passed this off to many of my friends.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is absolutely delicious.  I didn't used the sesame oil, used west indian pepper sauce instead of hot sauce and it marindated for about 1 hour.  But it still turned out so good. My boyfriend kept saying he must  marry me if i keep cooking like this! So i will continue to use this recipe, I'm working my way towards a tiffany's ring :)

This was very good, but not nearly as spicy as I was expecting - - and I even used a good dollop of sriracha sauce, too.  I loved the sesame oil flavor.  My shrimp marinated for over 3 hours and were just fine.  Thanks for a great recipe, Pat.

Very, very good marinade. I didn't have any chili paste (I really thought I did before mixing!) so I used red curry paste. Also, I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I really like the complexity of the spicy, savory as well as sweet, so the brown sugar made it alot more appealing to me. My husband LOVED it. We made 6 big shrimp kabobs with red onion and red/green pepper and halved the recipe - the marinade was more than enough.

absolutly the best. I had to make copies of this recipe for all who attended a recent cookout. There are no leftovers no matter how many pounds of shrimp are cooked.I have made these tasty treats several times and pretty much always follow the recipe.I will continue cooking these shrimp for all occasions.

First I have to apologize I usually never rate a recipe that I have made changes to. I always try as written first then base my reviews on that. With that being said I was looking for a spicy "Asian" shrimp recipe to go with the beef and chicken Korean BBQ I was making and I came across this one. The sesame oil and Asian chile paste caught my eye, I then read the reviews and noticed how many people used siracha as the hot sauce. I decided to go for it and add 2 things to get it to exactly what I was looking for. I omitted the salt and added 2 Tbs Soy sauce and 1 Tbs brown sugar. It turned out perfect!!! I still have a pound of shrimp in the freezer so I will be making those using the recipe as written. Thanks so much for the recipe, it saved the shrimp part of our bbq!!! Served it with the beef bulgogi and the Korean bbq chicken marinade recipes from this both sliced thin and cooked on skewers with brown rice and Thai cucumber salad...everyone loved it!

I made half the amount of marinade for just two servings of shrimp.  I wanted to have a little extra for basting some veggie kabobs we grilled along with this.  I did make some changes.  I halved the sesame oil, skipped the parsley (didn’t have any), used one large clove of garlic, and left the lemon juice out.  I was very unsure as to which type of Asian chile paste the recipe was referring to, so I used Sriracha and used 2 T.   We liked this, but it didn’t have the pizzazz I was expecting, probably due to my choice of Sriracha sauce.  I might try this again, but will use a Thai chili garlic paste I have on hand. I’ll definitely have to reduce the amount though, because that stuff’s really hot!

Amazing is right! Cut back on the sesame oil, and used cilantro instead of parsley (hate parsley). Used sriracha for the hot sauce, and kinda wished I'd used lime juice instead of lemon - will do that next time. Marinated for 12 hours which was perfect for us - imparted tons of flavor, and a really nice spicy kick. Thanks for an easy but super flavorsome recipe, Pat!

very good if you like some heat!  This was perfect for my hubby and I who like the heat, but I will have to use less hot sauce next time for th kiddos.  Very nice flavor though.  I grilled mine in a grill pan with some snow peas, green beans, onion and pepper and served over brown rice for a nice  tastey but healthy dinner

My new favorite meal! I halved the recipe for my husband and me, and we ate every shrimp! Left out the sesame oil and just used olive oil. I will probably use the marinade next time I make any seafood for the grill, it was just the perfect amount of spice.

Awesome...we had a horrific storm come through the night I was to grill so I did it on my George Forman.  It worked out great.  Very tasty...just the right amount of seasoning form our family.  I will definitely make this again.

This is the real deal.  We have tried other grilled shrimp recipes on All Recipes and we found this one to be the best.  As an order of clarification, for the “hot sauce” we used the regular Tabasco Sauce.  And for the “Asian chile paste” we used the Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce which comes in the red squeeze bottle.  For skewers, we used metal ones in lieu of wood.  Otherwise we followed the recipe to the T.  The shrimp turned out great!  We highly recommend this recipe.  The shrimp have a little bite to them, but we like hot and spicy food.

This is by far the best grilled shrimp recipe I have used. I took the advice of others since I didn't have asian chile paste and used the sriracha hot sauce. I have now made this for my family and friends and they all love it...even the ones that said they didn't like shrimp! I have found that we like it best if the grill is screaming hot and it chars the marinade just enough for a little crunch. Again, thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!

Easy and delicious.  Added red pepper flakes and used cilantro instead of parsley. It's winter, so I marinated for 10 mins, then dumped the marinade in as sauce and sauteed for a few mins with red and green peppers and snow peas.  Pour over rice.  Great!

Tasted like the restaurants!  ONLY marinade I will use for shrimp - it was so, so good!  Will use in shrimp tacos next time.

It wasn't that great because the sesame oil took over too much. I would try this again with leaving out the sesame oil and chili paste and add more hot sauce.

Hint for the parents trying this. Make the marinade, don't add the hot sauce or chile sauce. Throw a dozen or so shrimp in a small zip bag, a few spoons of the sauce. Add hot sauce, and proceed as normal. Then you end up with a non spiced skewer, and a few awesomely spicy ones. This marinade recipe will become a staple in my home. Good on beef, veggies, everything.

Loved this recipe! Don't skimp on the hot sauce or paste, it's really not that hot and this is coming from a Minnesotan! The flavor is amazing

This is fantastic!  The only change I make in this recipe is that I grill it in a foil pouch.  By doing so, the juices stay in and the shrimp remains more tender.  This is hands down my favorite shrimp recipe ever!

Good but not 5 stars good.  Used chile garlic sauce in place of the paste as that is what I had.  I had to use dried parsley.  Might try again with fresh parsley.  Probably worthy of a second try.

Yum!  I've made this twice now.  The first time, exactly as the recipe is written.  Yum!  The second time, a little less sesame oil, and more hot sauce and chile paste.  Yum!  Because it grills so quickly, I didn't baste the reserved sauce, and the shrimp still comes out flavorful and tasty.  *To complete the meal: I grilled up some yellow squash, red onion and mushrooms, using one of those gridded plates, 10-12 minutes basted with italian dressing and a little garlic.  Yum!

I made this recipe today and based on some reviews I cut down o the hot sauce and the asian chili paste by half and I should not have done that. It turned out really good but my family and I would like it next time to be more spicy.

This was awesome! Used sirracha sauce for the hot sauce and substituted lime juice for the lemon juice. We grilled it, it was absolutely decicious! Excellent! The shrimp didn't even make it off the grill, we ate them right off the grill pans, they were so good! Update: have made several times now including how the recipe states- NEVER a let down! My favorite recipe of all time for shrimp! YUM YUM YUM!

I thought this was just okay and was expecting a lot more due to all the great reviews.  It was definately spicy and I like that you can adjust the spice based on how you like it.  However, I found it to be nothing spectacular and prefer the basil shrimp recipe instead.

I made this shrimp when we had another couple over for dinner.  It was outstanding!  I used frozen shrimp that I thawed, and they turned out perfectly.  Only difference is I  marinated for about 45 minutes to one hour, and it was plenty.   Will definitely make again!

Delicious!  Two of us ate it all up in about five minutes.  Forgot to brush the reserved sauce on the shrimp so we just dipped them in the sauce.  Will definately make again and again and again.

I didn't have asian sauce, so I omitted it per previous reviews.  Also, I used cilantro instead of parsley and lime juice instead of lemon.  I think I would use a little less sesame oil next time.  Overall good recipe.  Would probably make again.

Quite good. I cooked these in the skillet with the marinade and served it over rice with broccoli and snap peas. Wonderful. I actually added more chilie sauce (perhaps cause mine was old). Yummy.

I made these on a camping trip and got great reviews, even the next day!  The blend of oils and spices were just right. Omitted Asian chile paste, because I could not find it, and cut back slightly on the minced garlic.  I made the marinade the night before and added to the shrimp about 3 hours before cooking.  I did not put them on skewers for time purposes and cooked them in a grilling basket instead.  I only wished that the fire had been hotter, because I had to cook them longer than expected and they seemed to get a little tough.

I was searching for something different than the normal "Dad's firecracker shrimp" and stumbled upon this recipe. I made it as specified except that I substituted dried parsley for the fresh, and also used the SriRaCha as was recomended by another cook. The flavor of the sesame oil combined with the hotness of the SriRaCha (Thai hot sauce) was wonderful. It was fast and very flavorful. We'll be making this recipe again!

MEGA 5 stars!  I didn't have Asian chile sauce- so I used 2 tbsp. chipolte Tabasco- about 1 tsp of cayenne and some Heinz Chili sauce.  Marinated for about 3 hours.  My DH was in HEAVEN!  Thanks for this 'keeper'.

Great recipe.  It was really easy to make and really easy to adjust to spiciness level to suit you own taste.  I will definitely use this one again.

This is a really excellent recipe.  It has a nice spicy yet Asian flavor.  I make a lot of the marinade and marinate the shrimp overnight.  I also put some extra marinade into a plastic bag and keep for marinating the shrimp while cooking.  I grill this on high and marinate at least three times per side, cooking for about 3 minutes per side.  The fresh parsley really gives it a nice color and flavor.  And today was an excellent day to grill (78 F, mid December).

This recipe is just fantastic. My son and I made this together and we had to really work at saving some for another night. Ours was on the salty side, so go easy. This may have been partly due to the hot chili sauce I used. I will make this again and try it with other seafood like scallops. Maybe some  red pepper/ pineapple, Oh yeah!!

really like this!  was looking for a quick-to-flavor marinade (quick as in 30 minutes).  made for bh and me.  ALWAYS looking for good grilled shrimp recipes with lots of punch to serve over salad. These were highly flavored.   took all the ingredients and tossed them into a plastic bag without measuring - maybe 2 tbs of the oils... all the ingredients, not the exact proportions.  my kinda recipe... seriously flavorful... really loved this one.  A must try.

Just tried it for a group of 22 people. It was a hit!  Used cilantro,green chili sauce and SriRaCha (Hot Sauce). Used peanut oil instead of sesame. Marinated it for  5-6 HRS. Did not use any lemon. Used 1 TBLSp less SriRaCha(cause green chili sauce is hot) and increased Ketchup by 1 TBLSp. TIP:  Add 1 TBSP of each sauce and decide if you want more heat or sweetness. I have a lot of cooking experience-this is a definite keeper!!

This recipe is fantastic although I reduced the hot sauce to suit my husbands taste.  I made it for company and everyone wanted the recipe.  I served it with orzo and asparagus salad for a luncheon...yummy.

The sauce was very good.  But, I have bottled it and given it along with the shrimp as a gift.  We'll get a better review later LOL.

Excellent flavor but a tad too hot for us.  The issue was probably mine as hubby was working late and I didn't want to make him fire up the grill so I just threw it all (marinade included) on the stove.  The heat may have been subdued if we hadn't eaten the marinade as well.  Will totally make again but grill next time as the flavor was fab.

This was great!. I didn't have hot sauce, so I used about alittle less then 1 TBSP of cayenne pepper, and I didn't have Asian Chile Paste, so I used Szechwan Chili Sauce. This was so good. It had a nice bite, not to hot. Thanks for a wounderful recipe.

These were really great - I didn't have sesame oil - so I skipped that, and used a Thai garlic chili sauce and followed the rest of the recipe exactly... I cooked on the grill and served with a Lemongrass and Chili Thai noodle side dish (premixed) and it was great... I brushed a little bit of the marinade I had reserved after cooking.  I used the easy peel shrimp (jumbo) and left the shell on before cooking -- this is kind of a pain because its messy getting them off after once their marinaded; but i find doing it this way keeps the shrimp from getting totally dried out... if serving for company though, I always peel off the shells... I'll definitely be making this one again.

This recipe makes my mouth water when I think about it; it has become a staple in our house.  The only things I have changed are I use 1/3 olive oil and 1/3 sunflower oil and we also add a hefty amount (about 2 tbsp) of fresh cilantro from the garden.  And every time I've made it, I've been out of lemon juice and substituted lime juice.  My husband and I don't order shrimp out anymore because of this recipe.  The ingredients may seem a bit odd at first, but trust me, it works in the end.

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago, and had my dad grill it. I served it as an entree with rice pilaf and french style green beans. My family LOVED it, and claimed it was one of the best recipes I've ever made. I will make this again, expecially for dinner guests, possibly as an appetizer :)

My husband and I loved this so I make this for chicken.  Marinaded for 6 hours and cooked on the grill.  It was excellent and did not burn like I thought it would.  When I cook chicken I use half the Weber and put charcoal on one side and the chicken on the other and slow cook for 1.5 hours.  If you take them off when they are done they are a beautiful color.  I think next time I will inject the meat or pack under the skin then place on the grill.

Made this for Valentine's Day supper.  Served with steaks, baked potatoes & tossed salad.  Lots of left over steak - no left over shrimp!!  I couldn't find Asain chile paste.  I used Chipotle sauce, and seemed to substitute nicely.  Will make this recipe again.

Flavor was excellent! A lil on the oily side though. I'll probably cut back on the oil next time...or eliminate basting while grilling. That could have been why it came out so oily. Will make these again!

Excellent recipe, I used lime and cilantro instead of lemon and parsley and two different people said they were the best tasting shrimp they'd ever had in their lives!

This is by far the best shrimp marinade ever! Delicious on chicken as well. Everyone at my house looks forward to these shrimp and we make them every time we fire up the grill. I receive nothing but rave reviews. I suggest using fresh cilantro instead of parsley if you are a fan...it makes it extra yummy. The smell of the shrimp grilling is intoxicating! Definately a keeper.

A HUGE hit in our house. My husband loves these shrimp. I also use this recipe to marinate scallops, which are also popular. The scallops don't absorb as much of the marinade as the shrimp do and are therefore, slightly less spicy but still tasty! I also couldn't find Asian chili paste so I use the Thai chili sauce instead, which I found at the grocery store in the "ethnic" foods section. Buy the jumbo shrimp and the large scallops. They cook up the best. Don't waste your time with pre-cooked shrimp. This recipe is worthy of 5 stars and is a regular treat at my house.

Fantastic!  I've handed this recipe out to about a dozen people!  I really would not change a thing.  Please splurge on the meaty Ex. Lrg. or Col. shrimp, and no pre-cooked shrimp in order to cut corners! You will love it.

Didn't necessarily change a thing other than I didn't have the full two hours to marinade.  It was a HIT!!  Super tasty shrimp!  Two pounds were gone within a few minutes. :)
Definitely a keeper recipe.

These were delicious! Made 3 pounds for everyone at work. If you let soak overnight (as I did) the lemon starts to cook the shrimp. I would recommend keeping with the directions.

I loved this recipe.  Didn’t have child sauce so I used chilli oil and a tablespoon of strawberry jam.  Also used a blend of fresh herbs including parsley, sweet basil and cilantro, mostly because I didn’t have enough parsley, but it was delicious.  Used schriracha sauce for heat and flavor

Old shrimp recipe got kicked to the curb after making this one. Note to self: Use half the sesame oil and make up the difference with EVOO. Use less garlic if pressing the cloves. Use Sweet Ginger Chili sauce/dip for the chili paste.

My husband said it was too spicy but he loved it! I on the other hand did not think it was too spicy but just right.  I only left the shrimp in the marinade for 1/2 hour as my  shrimp weren't that big and I didn't want them to start "cooking" in the marinade.

Super easy and a solid flavor. I did not have the Chile paste, so I used garlic Sariacha instead and it was delicious. I also did the grill basket instead of skewers. Excited for leftovers for lunch this week.

I made this close to the letter, but halved the ingredients. I didn’t have fresh parsley, so I used the same amount in dried. I think I might use a little less oil and more Asian chili paste next time. I used Sambal Oelek for the Asian chili. Also I might suggest taking off the grates and cleaning the lower portion of the grill because mine lit up like a burning Xmas tree lol. Or lower the grill temp.

These shrimp were very good cooked on the grill, but I will definitely add more Asian chili paste next time.

This was fantastic! I made a few changes like instead of ketchup I used Dave's devils spit bbq sauce and added hoisin sauce. For the hot sauce I used tapito hot sauce. Definitely a keeper! We doubled the recipe for the sauce reserving half the sauce. The other half was used to marinate the shrimp for a few hours. I made fried rice and put the grilled shrimp on top drizzling the unused reserved sauce on top. So delicious!

The is fabulous! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, and I wouldn't change a thing. I'm from New Orleans, so I know good shrimp. It reminds me of Shrimp Mosca back in the old days when Mama Mosca was still alive and running Mosca's. This one's a keeper!

This was sooo good! I substituted the hot sauce and Asian Chili paste for Siracha sauce, it was not as spicy as you would think. Next time I will make it with the hot sauce and Siracha.

I didn't have time to marinate the shrimp so I sautéed them in the marinade instead. Turned out fantastic! Served over white rice. Another great recipe to keep!!

Great marinade! I didn't make any changes. I will definitely make it again. I don't usually buy frozen seafood, but I had a bag of TJ's frozen red Argentinian shrimp in my freezer. Most of my work on this dish wash researching the best way to defrost frozen shrimp. Once I sorted that out, I marinated the shrimp for only two hours as instructed. Very, very good.

I made this for dinner and my husband said it was the best shrimp I've ever made! He told me to be sure to print this one and put it in the "keeper" book. I made it exactly how it is written and I used Frank's hot sauce. We used a grill mat which worked perfectly because it allowed the shrimp to cook in its juices and it kept the grill clean. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

Made it twice to the letter. Both times  made the whole recipe for only 1 lb. shrimp. Used the rest on a small batch of tiny chick legs the 1st time - still waiting to use the leftovers from the second...this is wonderful. Endless possibilities!

Tried this because I like bold flavors. I used Tabasco and only 1/2 T of Chili sauce (Sriracha) fearing it would be too hot. It wasn't.  Outstanding !

Made this last weekend and it was absolutely the best grilled shrimp ever! I saved some of the grilled shrimp and ate it later in the week by simply reheating it in the Microwave and it still tasted superb!
Great recipr!

I've never had much luck making shrimp so I hesitated to try this.  But oh my goodness!!!  Even a picky 12 year old thought it was amazing.  He was already jockeying for the leftovers tomorrow.  It's just enough spicy and just enough sweet and completely delicious!!!  Only change I made was to do just olive oil vs. sesame oil due to an allergy to sesame.  Next time I will try it with less salt because it is pretty salty.  I can't wait to have guests over to wow them with this.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This is the best spicy Asian-style shrimp recipe out there! Have made this 4 times and it is always great. Threading the shrimp on two skewers works well when grilling. Last time I made this I subbed cilantro instead of parsley and thought it was even better.  I also adapted this recipe for salmon    and just need to post that one! As is, can use on salmon and tastes great.  Can't recommend this recipe for grilled shrimp enough!

I made these last night for the first time and they were amazing! The marinade was easy (I replaced the lemon juice with rice wine vinegar since I didn't have any lemons on hand). They grilled up perfectly and I served them with Cauliflower fried "rice"...so happy I have leftovers for lunch today!

Yum!  I used Cholula for the hot sauce and since I didn't have chili paste, added in some red pepper flakes.  Also, only had lime juice, not lemon. And no parsley. But it was still awesome and super easy.  Wasn't too hot.

I didn't have Asian chile paste, so subbed with chili sauce and marinated the shrimp for almost 24 hours. Hubby said it was the best shrimp he'd ever had. Thank you so much for the recipe - we'll do this again and again.

WOW This is truly a great recipe. I an NOT a good cook but I tried this recipe and it was the best shrimp I ever ate home made or in a restaurant.  I can't believe that I made them myself. My wife wants me  make them again this weekend when our children are over. My only question for the author is what other recipes do you have. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

This is my "Go To" recipe for shrimp.  We have it almost every other week.  Super easy and super yummy! I use less sesame oil then the recipe calls for, I eyeball it but probably just a couple of tablespoons and I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley.  I also add the lemon juice right before I am ready to grill it as several other people have mentioned.

I made this when we had friends over for dinner. We barely had any leftovers. Everyone including my 17 month old loved this. Friends asked for the recipe. I definitely will make this again. Maybe use this to make shrimp tacos. Yum!!!

This is the only way I cook grilled shrimp. I've made them about 20 times and they are always a hit. They are great left over, but we rarely have any.  You can adjust the heat to your taste.

Amazing is absolutely right.  I forgot the garlic, but didn't miss is.  I halved the recipe for 1 pound of shrimp, used Siracha for the hot sauce, and didn't baste.  The natural sweetness from the shrimp with the heat and tang from the lemon juice was a perfect blend.

I've used this marinade many times and it is awesome. 

Mix up a small bowl of mayo and ketchup as a dip. (The "special sauce" from the movie "Stepbrothers") Surprisingly delicious! :) Helps balance out the spice.

Great recipe!  I changed nothing!  Shrimp was very flavorful but not as spicy as I thought it would be, mellow enough for kids and my parents as well.  I used pre-cooked and peeled jumbo shrimp, let the shrimp marinate for about 5 hours and then right before grilling I sprinkled a little mesquite seasoning (a very little bit) over the shrimp.  I then grilled the shrimp for just a minute to lock in the flavor.
