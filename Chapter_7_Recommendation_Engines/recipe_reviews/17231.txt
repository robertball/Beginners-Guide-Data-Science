This was a hit with my family!!  I substituted onion soup mix for the chicken soup mix and the flavor popped.  Also, used brown rice which took a little longer to cook but tasted so yummy!  Simple and delicious!

This recipie is easy to make on a busy day, plus my family thought it tasted great. A red bell pepper also works well in this dish, if someone doesn't like green peppers.

Although I changed a few things, this was a great base recipe. First, I used olive oil to brown the chicken. I used the boneless thighs I had in the freezer, which stayed nice and juicy. I used carrots and celery for the veggies and I might even use peas next time. Lastly, I used onion soup mix as others had suggested. It turned out great and so amazingly easy to make. The only thing I might do different would be to use regular rice instead of instant. The rice was a little soggy for my taste. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made mine with Onion Soup mix. Yummy. Easy. My rice came out a little bit greasy, so I made another couple of servings on the stove and mixed it in. Just right now! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is a GREAT concept and a WONDERFUL guideline to follow. I hardly ever follow directions when making recipes, and I really don't want to be one of those people who list what they did differently,  but I have got to commend you for this recipe! I used very health-friendly, non-dairy ingredients, even down to the packet of dry chicken soup and was VERY VERY pleased both times I have made this! Thank you for posting your idea!

This dish was easy to make. I made a big pot and my family ate all of it in one night! I'm adding it to my favorite list.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. I do agree though that you only need one cup of water for the rice mix. After I put the chicken in the oven with the rice mix, I turned the oven up to 375 degrees because it seemed to take longer to cook the chicken than the original recipe said. Otherwise everything was great :),

I used chicken boneless, skinless chicken thighs, about 3 lbs but probably less after cutting the fat off. I also used a bell pepper and the onion mix like some others suggested. Finally, I used 1.5 cups of quinoa instead of rice. Definitely adding this one to the rotation. oh, next time, I would add more water. The liquid in mine dried out but even then, it was still good.

This was delicious. Nice, quick and easy to make. Tons of flavor.  I used chicken broth instead of water which added some sodium and flavor.  This is on my favorite main dish menu.

Awesome recipe.   We make this all the time and even the kids who are picky eaters eat it up.    We use reduced sodium chicken broth instead of water and French onion soup mix as other reviews have suggested.  We usually mix in some frozen mixed vegetables to make a quick easy meal that everyone enjoys.

I also substituted onion soup mix, added a touch of parsley and minced garlic along with very thin sliced carrots and a dab of chicken stock. Veeeeery tasty.

I am rating only 4 stars because I decided to take the reviewers' suggestions instead of following the recipe exactly, and it came out great that way. I used oil instead of shortening, sliced potatoes instead of peppers, and onion soup mix instead of chicken rice soup mix. I also used sushi rice, as it was the only one I had on hand. The rice was just the right amount of "mushy" for my liking in this type of dish. It had all dried up and I thought I hadn't put in enough liquid, but since everything had already softened, it tasted good. I highly recommend for an easy dinner.
