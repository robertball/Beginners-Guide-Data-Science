We love asparagus and I always like to try new recipes. I knew it would be dense when I saw only whole wheat flour so I used half whole wheat half all purpose. Half a cup of oil seemed like a lot but I used it along with the 4 eggs. There didn't seem to be anything that would make it rise either. I did put it in 2 pie plates instead of a 9X13" baking dish and adjusted the time. The result was a very dense (hard) consistency with oil floating around the edges. I don't believe anyone really made this dish before with these ingredients and amount because it doesn't work. It was a complete waste of money for the asparagus and grated cheese. Sorry.
