Was an absolute hit at my house tonight.wanted to try something new and this was it! Super easy to make and absolutely delicious. I subbed the green peppers out for red peppers though. I was nervous about the ground turkey but it was perfect. The flavors are terrific and compliment each other well. I will definitely be making this again, a new fall favorite!

My husband and I loved this recipe! The spices, tomatoes, pumpkin, ground turkey, and sweet potatoes were a delicious combination of flavors. Next time, I'll probably add some canned or frozen corn since I think that would be good with the other ingredients. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is really good and easy to put together.  I love the twist on traditional shepherd's pie flavors.  Gonna make it again tonight!

Loved this!  I did leave out the peppers and cumin as my system does not tolerate those spicy ingredients.  I will definitely be making this again.
