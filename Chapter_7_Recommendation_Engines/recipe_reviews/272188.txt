I changed this a bit by adding a whole lb of bacon (yum) and 1/2 large onion to 1/2 head of chopped cabbage. Also added a capsule of Turmeric  Curcumin (1000 mg) instead of paprica.
Can sprinkle paprica on top when serving.

I made it as is,  and I will make it again.  It was great with our black-eyed peas and cornbread for New Year's Day.
