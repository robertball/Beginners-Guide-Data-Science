So refreshing! I like to use the light cranberry juice, because then it is low calorie too!

Even better? Add 2-4 oz. of sparkling wine or sparkling soda. NOTE: And yes, this can be made with "light" cranberry juice and you won't even notice the difference.

I would highly recommend adding a simply syrup to this recipe, as it will make it sweeter. Remember, by adding sparkling water, we're diluting the juice concentration, and so we'll want to try and counter-act that by adding sweetness!  I would add  1Oz of a simple syrup per serving, or 1 1/2 cups per Liter.

Very refreshing. Drank these all summer.  A shot of vodka makes this a perfect, light cocktail.

We use light cranberry juice and Fresca, a grapefruit flavored soda.  It is the best!

This was a great baby shower drink, and matched our color theme perfect! Make sure to get the lime, thats what perks it up.

I drink this year round!  Use it as a great replacement for drinking regular soda.  Healthy, refreshing, and no caffeine.

This is a very elegant and tasty drink to serve to teenagers prior to prom.  Usually a large group will gather for pre prom pictures and these with a few hors d'oerves is a perfect way to start off their special evening.

This was just ok for me. I won't use it again.
