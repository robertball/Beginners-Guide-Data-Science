I made these and they were delicious! I made more so I just tripled the ingredient portions. In addition I added extra salt. I also added two japenos and two serrano peppers to the salsa, as well as a little oregano. What was left I made pork with and mixed the pork with the salsa and made pork tamales as well. Thank you so much for the recipe!!!!  I have been married to a mexican for 20 years, and these were very authentic!

I tasted the dough while making it for salt content.  I thought i had a sufficient amount but after cooking obviously ,i  was wrong. The recipe states to salt to taste so we can't blame the recipe LOL!  I myself thought it kind of bland in taste ( and I added Mexican chili powder to the masa and shredded chicken) and also noticed that those who raved also threw in lots more flavor.  My suggestion is if you like lots of flavor you need to add the spices you love.  I think it's a great starter recipe .  I'll make it again but will certainly add a great deal more than I initially did. A tamale should be able to stand on its own in flavor without having to douse it in hot sauce or other condiments.

Perfect recipe! The prep took a long time but it was worth it for mouthwatering tamales. I made this with banana leaves instead of corn husks and with pasilla peppers. The only change I would make would be to use more than two teaspoons for the masa mix since they were fairly small. This is delicious with some tapatio!

Just a pinch more salt.
