Added pecans to batter.  Served with extra caramel bourbon sauce and cinnamon ice cream. It was a big hit.

I agree with previous baker of this cake, it was a bit dense, flavor was spot on, but I think the stevia is too sweet , and maybe you could use just sugar. Let's face it , your not exactly counting your calories with eating cake, but like anything all in moderation.  I have to say it came out exactly appearance wise as the recipe, so that would be an A+ . Very pretty on your table.

Too dense, in a not good way.  Heavy, without a soft crumb. Instead of pumpkin pie spice, I used 1/2 tsp each of ginger, cloves and nutmeg, and a tsp of cinnamon. I think Iâ€™ll just keep looking for a good recipe.
