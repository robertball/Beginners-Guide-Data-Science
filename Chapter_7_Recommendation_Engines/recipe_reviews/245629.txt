It was amazing!!! I did make a couple changes due to comments and cutting some fat. I also used squared potatos instead of shredded. Then I added Morton's Garlic Sea Salt due to the comments of adding the garlic. Plus it has some parsley in it for more flavor. I traded ground pepper for cracked pepper. Traded for fat free sour cream. I also used 1/3rd fat free cream cheese and traded the regular milk for fat free half and half.  That is just my thing though because I believe it cooks better with a long cook time then milk. Due to my years as a barista. None of this messed with the flavor. Though this is the most amazing soup/potato soup that I have ever had! Hats off and Thank you for sharing!!!

After reading all the reviews on this and how bland it is I added a few things to my recipe and it's made it so much more delicious. I added fresh chopped celery, fresh parsley,onion flakes , onion salt,  a clove a garlic minced..and I used bacon fresh from the butcher that has more of the Smokey taste. I also did not fully cook the bacon so the fat would help with flavoring. It was awesome.  Wish I would of doubled the recipe it was a hit for my family.

This is my third batch of this soup to date!  I made it a few times last fall and have finally got it exactly like we like it.  The changes Iâ€™ve made are to use 2 cups of milk and two cups of chicken broth or stock, I add about a cup of finely diced carrots and celery and about 1/2 of a medium onion finely diced plus a 2.7oz package of real bacon pieces  I omitted the cheddar during cooking but  use plenty for garnish along with a few more bacon pieces.  This freezes well in ziplock bags too.

Too thick.  I did not care for it at all.  If i ever did make it again, which is doubtful, I would use some chicken broth to thin it out some.  Tasted like too much dairy to me.

I made this exactly to the recipe and was not happy with it at all.  It was way too thick, and practically tasteless.  However, there is an upside, I added chicken (two cans), four cups of chicken broth, salt, garlic and curry powder.  That thinned the soup out and gave it flavor that was missing from the original recipe.  My husband, who is not usually picky, said the changes I made really improved it and asked for seconds.

This was very good and very easy to put together.  I used 1 package of Ore-Ida diced hash browns and added some dried onions omitting the green onions.  I added a dash of pepper and some salt.  Next time I will add more cheese.

This recipe is so yummy but I made a few changes. Instead on hash browns I used diced red potatoes. I also added 3 minced cloves of garlic and half a red onion diced. I also added dried parsley. Cooked on low for four hours was perfect!

I wasn't crazy about the texture of the hash browns, so I put them through the food processor to mush them up. Also, it was a little bland to me and my family so I added basil, garlic salt, and a little onion salt to pep up the taste. Not sure I'll make this specific recipe again.

After 2 hours on high, it was not thoroughly heated.  Perhaps the hash browns were  to be thawed prior to cooking?
