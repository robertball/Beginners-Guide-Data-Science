This was really good and so easy! Fresh corn is out of season so I used canned corn(but I'm sure frozen would be good too).  I chopped the bacon and cooked it in a regular saute pan.  I took the bacon out and added the peppers and onions.  I added the canned corn and tomatoes at the end.  I forgot the milk but I used some cajun seasoning as well as the cayenne pepper.  I put the bacon crumbles on top before serving so they would stay crispy.  We ate this with ribs and mashed potatoes. Thanks for a good recipe - I can't wait to try it with fresh corn!

We wanted something light and summery for dinner so decided on this recipe.  I was skeptical about milking the cob-I cut mine so close there was nothing left(we didn't need it anyway).  I used 2 roma tomatos, 1/2 a large onion and a good dash of garlic powder.  I didn't think the 1/4 cup of milk would do it, but it was perfect.  I didn't use cayenne as then the kids wouldn't eat it.  The adults enjoyed it though the flavor was mild.  Next time I will use bacon grease instead of vegetable oil to step up the flavor a little bit.  Thanks!

Really great recipe. Unfortunately, I had to use frozen corn as corn on the cob is out of season here. The bacon and tomato really made the dish and the cayenne put it over the top. Be VERY careful how much you add. Do it very slowly. A tiny tiny sprinkle goes a looong way.

Turned out great with no modifactions. If/when I make this again I'll dice the onions rather than slice them for the sake of consistency and to make it easier to eat. It went over really well at a covered dish luncheon.

Very good.  I used three cups of canned corn, drained, instead of fresh.

I made this as a side dish for a Mardi Gras dinner party.  Everyone loved it.  I made it as written, using red and orange peppers and frozen corn and adding "Slap Ya Mama" Cajun seasoning.  I soaked the corn in a mixture of 2% milk and Half and Half while I chopped all the vegetables and fried the bacon.  After cooking as directed, I put it in a preheated 200 degree F oven to keep warm until transporting to the party.  I did add the bacon and green onions before putting the dish in the oven.  I plan to make this again as a side dish -- Mardi Gras or not!  As someone at the party said, "Why don't we do this with corn all the time?  This is SO good!"

Great flavor! Especially warm/hot. I don't recommend eating it cold as you lose some of that flavor. Served it with a kilbasa. Yummo!

This was a great cool-down with a hot Cajun meal.  If you're feeling lazy, you can also use bacon bits instead of the real thing.

Yes it's really that good. 5 stars. It's worth the extra effort of using fresh corn off the cob. I also went heavy handed with the cayenne, I like spicy! Used only a tablespoon or two of milk. Such a fresh tasting combination of flavors, wasn't sure I would like the fresh tomatoes in this, but wow they work very nicely with the other flavors. Sweet and savory.

I thought it was relatively easy to make, and I got several favorable comments on it, so it must have been pretty good! I did read through the comments and modified the recipe accordingly (diced onions instead of sliced, canned corn instead of ears).   Keep in mind when you are planning this that you have to allow enough time to cook the bacon; you don't need it until the very end, so you can do the bacon and the other parts of the maque choux at the same time if you like, but some people (especially with smaller stoves) may want to do the bacon first.

A delightfully different way to serve corn. Used fresh bi-color corn. Cut about 1/2 to 2/3’s from the kernels in first pass. Scraped the cobs using sharp edge of knife to get the remaining ‘milk’ and pulp out. Chopped the onions for easier eating. Cooked peppers & onions in 1 tablespoon bacon grease versus the suggested vegetable oil. Subbed a red bell pepper for green, and added 2 chopped fresh jalapeno peppers (one deseeded & membrane removed to temper heat). Subbed Creole Seasoning from this site for the cayenne pepper. The bacon is what really puts this recipe over the top and distinguishes it from other corn dishes. It’s worth buying a better cut, and we preferred thick-sliced bacon. Excellent recipe YOYO78.

So good.  Made this when my sis-in-law came over and we all loved it.  Easy and the perfect amount of spiciness.  I served it with the Teriyaki Pork Tenderloin from this site and a cucumber salad.

This was noisy, the kids were  digging into their ramekins to get every last bit.  I used red peppers  and  canned corn.  Can only be better with fresh. Perfect side with Johnsonville Hot N Spicy (Cajun) Brats topped with Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping.

Wonderful side dish. My only change was to use Tony's seasoning and some hot sauce instead of salt and cayenne pepper. Thanks for posting!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving to accompany our Cajun Turducken. My guests loved it and the recipe has become a staple at home (minus the bacon because I consider it a treat). It is so easy to make and tastes so yummy. I too use canned corn soaked in milk. When I use bacon, I saute all of the veggies in the bacon grease instead of the vegetable oil for extra flavor.

Excellent! Just made a variation of this from a different recipe I found (pretty much the same... didn't have tomato and used red bell instead of green... and heavy cream in place of milk...). Excellent side dish to go with BBQs - loved the flavors! Can't go wrong with bacon!!

I tweaked the recipe in two places: (1) I used 1/2 cup of heavy cream instead of milk.  (2) I added 1-1/2 lbs of raw shrimp during the last 10 minutes of cooking time, cooking only long enough for the shrimp to turn pink.  The addition of the shrimp made the dish hearty enough to serve alone yet still be substantial enough for 4 men and a growing 10-year-old girl!  Everybody had seconds!  Thank you.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  I think it might be my favorite way to eat corn now...very refreshing!  I followed the recipe exactly, exceipt I added in two small diced tomatillos which I thought went perfect with this dish!

Not bad at all. Here are my suggestions.....Use either 8 oz butter to saute', or cook 4 strips bacon to a crisp, use bacon grease to saute'.

 Add everything, simmer 12 min. Add salt n Cayenne, simmer another 15 min.

This recipe is fine as is, really nice job.

GREAT, Excellent way to change up corn.
Thanks! If you like all these ingredients, this is a must try!!!

Made for Mardi Gras without bell peppers or green onions and I used canned corn.  Even the non-veggie eater enjoyed the dish! Will be making again!

Great for cookouts. Milk is not needed if fresh corn is used. I also used graped tomatoes as someone suggested. I did add some Cajun seasoning for extra flavor. I made 12 servings and didn't have any leftovers to take home. That's when you know it's good!

This has become a Thanksgiving and potluck staple for my family.  I make a few minor modifications - I use the bacon grease instead of vegetable oil, I use heavy cream instead of milk, and I chop the onion instead of slice.  The first two make the dish rich and buttery.  Definitely the best maque choux recipe I've found!

Pretty good, a nice side dish for our New Orleans inspired meal this evening.  I made this as written except I had to sub frozen corn, I chopped the onions instead of slicing, and I omitted the cayenne during cooking so I could offer a non-spicy version to the children.  I am eager to try this dish again when corn is in season and I can prepare as written.  The frozen corn made the dish watery.  I am thinking the fresh corn and corn milk will improve the wateriness and elevate this dish to the full five stars.  We ate this with the Garlic Alfredo Tilapia (submitted by "youngwoman") seasoned with Slap Ya Mama and served over seasoned rice.

Great recipe. I made it "as is" with the addition of 2 tbs of butter for flavor.  I will be making this again...but doubled because it went so fast at dinner!

I liked. Really wished we had fresh corn in season. Kids thought there were too many green peppers and onions. So maybe next time I'll half the onions and add red pepper instead of green

Hub loved it! Will definitely make again. Had to use canned corn but everything else was fresh. Great side dish. Paired with Oregano Chicken and Collard Greens.

I made this for a Mardi Gras dinner and everyone thought it was outstanding.  I sauteed the onion and pepper in the fat from cooking the bacon.  Instead of cayenne, I used Slap Ya Mamma Cajun seasoning, and since it's winter, I had to use canned corn.  It's so delicious I can't imagine how wonderful it would be with fresh corn.  You can believe I'm going to try it in the summer time!  It was a perfect addition to a dinner of gumbo, rice, baked catfish, Louisiana cole slaw,  baguette, and home made king cake.

LOVE this. So many flavors and a great use for fresh corn. My kids gobbled it down and asked me to make it again.

Pretty tasty recipe. Milking the corn was interesting and not too complicated but not sure how much it added to the flavor. Bacon added a nice salt and smoke taste but overall it was just a good corn dish. Good start to some future variations I think and at least it wasn’t just buttered corn on the cob!

I was making this in the middle of winter, so I had to use frozen corn and cherry tomatoes (which are usually good, regardless of season). I had to add a bit of sugar to compensate for the miserableness of frozen corn, but all in all, it was quite tasty. My only complaint was that I'm not sure what the milk was for. It didn't contribute anything meaningful to the finished result.

This was pretty great. I used frozen corn because it's January and fresh corn is a distant memory. I also skipped the added vegetable oil and just used the bacon grease.

I Canned eons of corn because I overestimated how I needed for the next year.   Because of this I am in need of coming up with diverse recipes so we don't get sick of such a great veggie.  This one is fantastic.  Its a great mix of flavor I would not have thought of.   The key to any recipe is to make it how you think you'd like it.   I didn't want as much onion so I halved it, and the cayenne was only a tiny bit sprinkled and the green onion was generous.  4 strips of bacon was plenty for us.  No salt needed since the bacon and canned corn already has some in it.  It was delicious.  I most definitely will make it again.  Make it!  I would be surprised it you regret it!

This stuff is fabulous! I made it with frozen corn instead of fresh and substituted heavy cream for milk as well as Tony's (creole seasoning) for the cayenne. It was amazing! My bf and I paired it with baked Dijon salmon and couldn't be happier. He said it was probably one of the best home cooked meals he's ever had. Definitely doing this one again soon (and doubling the recipe!)

This was amazing! I just took the suggestions of a couple other reviewers and I sauted it in the bacon grease and since I didn't have cayenne pepper I used cajun seasoning.  Lovely flavor and very nice side dish with a grilled steak! Thank you for the recipe

I've been making corn maque choux for years and it's always a huge hit at our family Christmas dinner. My version is almost the same as this one: I use 16 oz. frozen shoepeg corn (that's white corn, if you don't have it under that name); 1/2 lb. andouille sausage ( if you use this, leave out the cayenne; trust me); and 4 roma tomatoes. I can't wait to try this version (it's BACON!), but c'mon folks, if you're gonna fry bacon, use the bacon grease to cook the onions and peppers.
