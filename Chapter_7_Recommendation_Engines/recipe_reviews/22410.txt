Back in the fifties when I grew up, dream bars were an actual fad. My mom was a professional baker and made the best dream bars ever. Unfortunately, I don't have her recipe and my mouth was watering when I found this one. However, it was a huge disappointment. It is nothing like the original which were chewy and not so terribly sweet and sticky. I believe this recipe has too much sugar and not enough flour. The base has so much sugar that it gets too hard. The other ingredients are probably about right. I would like to see someone come up with one of the more satisfactory old recipes. I'm sorry to have to call this one a flop.

These bars turned out just fine....but the flavor was lacking - non-descriptively just "sweet".  Next time, I'll add some sort of "chips" - choc, pb, or cinnamin perhaps.

We made them in my culinary arts class at my high school and they turned out awesome! dont eat too much though... tummy ache! Just remember that the crust doesnt have to be set to put the filling on. These also make great with freezing for snacks later...

WOW! These are amazing! Very rich dessert! If you love coconut then you will love these! They are nice and chewy. I made these last night & they turned out perfect. I was looking for something different to make & these really hit the spot, I will be making these again soon. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. :)

The top of these bars are like pecan pie and very good. I was not happy with the crust it tasted good but was a little hard and so greasy I had to take them out of the pan and put them on paper towels! Next time I will use less marg. and a little more flour.

I thought these were just ok, but my mom and grandmother went wild over them.  Mine dried out a few days after I made them, so next time I would definitely eat them within 2 days.  Thanks for sharing.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!! I am obsessed with baking and this seems to be a big hit in my household as well as friend groups. I've made it for several people and they all love it as well. Instead of the walnuts I suggest substituting chocolate chips. You can never go wrong with chocolate! ??

Loved these, and I don't care for coconut. My mother made Dream Bars in the 50's, but we no longer have the recipe. These were at least as good as Mom's, but were much thicker than I remember, so I'm going to use a 9 x 13 pan next time.  Just a suggestion.

These were really easy to make, and really yummy. Much richer than I imagined. The recipe was a little vague- wasn't sure if the crust should be set before I added the topping, not sure what the topping should look like when it was finished... but I winged it and it came out great (the second time it came out great- the first time I forgot to set the timer and burned it! But even then, my roommate thought it tasted good!)
