Woah. Made this for our housewarming. Substituted cayanne for smoked paprike because I do not care for things with a kick. Also substitued the milk with coconut milk because of family allergies and used a dairy-free sour cream. And even with all that subbing it still came out the show stopper

My grandfather was a chef by trade and he made this dish often and now I do.  We call it White fish pie and make it with cod or haddock.  Other than that, the recipe is the same.  

It is wonderful comfort food on a cold winters night served with steamed green beans, crusty bread and a good bottle of white.  Yum!

Great recipe!   Used FRESH cod cooked by poaching.  Rest of recipe done per instructions.   Delicious with the light lemon throughout with a nice creaminess and crisp top...made a meal!

I was soooo excited to make this. Chef John's video was so enthusiastic I was worried I was missing out by not having this app in my repertoire, turns out, I wasn't missing out. After a few days of prep. This was an arduous process that did not pay off. I was so unimpressed by the bland dip, even parmesan didnt improve it. I am so glad I tried this on hubby before presenting it to friends or family.  I made recipe as suggested, no substitutions.

My family loved it ate it all up. For special occasion I would add some cream. To reduce the salt, I made mashed potatoes separately then combined with the mashed fish.

This was fun to make and I was really excited about it.  However it didn't really wow me. It was an interesting dish to make for a change of pace.

Tasted very good! But it felt to me that it was missing something still.
