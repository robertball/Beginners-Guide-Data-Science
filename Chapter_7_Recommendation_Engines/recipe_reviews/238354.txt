This salad was very refreshing and delicious. I cut down the recipe to 5 serving sizes and it was still a decent amount for two people. I used heirloom tomatoes (a variety of different colors). The red onion and lemon juice gave it a nice flavor! I will surely make it again.

A great salad. The cilantro adds a nice touch.
