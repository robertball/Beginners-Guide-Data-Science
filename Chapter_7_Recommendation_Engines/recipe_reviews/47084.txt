I made this for my friend's bridal shower and everyone kept asking, "Who made this punch?!" They all loved it! 

I used two packages of raspberry Jell-O and one package of strawberry Jell-O and cut the sugar back to about 2 cups -- and it was still plenty sweet. 

I divided the mixture (minus the ginger ale) into three gallon ziplock freezer bags and froze them. They were mostly hard, but not totally frozen about 15 hours after I put them in the freezer, and when I mixed it with the ginger ale (I used 1 bottle of ginger ale per bag of Jell-O mixture), it came out nice and slushy!

The bride loved it so much she asked for the recipe and is using it for her wedding reception!

This was excellent, sweet and a great offering.  All of my guests liked it.  It was quite hard from the freezer and the ginger ale did not melt it.  Should be taken out of the freezer several hours before serving to "chop up" or defrost in microwave for a while before adding ginger ale.  Once somewhat thawed, it made a slushy punch which had a different and great consistency than watery punch.  (Maybe because of the jello?!) A winner!

Excellent!@ LIttle nervous about serving this at my mother in law's birthday party for 40, but it was a huge hit! Ran out of Ginger Ale, so we started substituting Hanson's Mandarin Lime soda, and it was still delicious! Used cranberry/raspberry jello and slightly reduced the sugar - froze in 13 x 8 pans so it would freeze faster and be easier to break up.

YUM! I made this for my wedding reception and it was GONE! I used Cranberry gelatin and halved the sugar as others had suggested which made it just right! Noting the thaw problem, I made the mix on Thursday night, let it freeze on Friday, and took it out Saturday morning around 9am for a 2pm party. It had a perfect slushy chill, and broke up with just the pour of the ginger ale and a couple stirs with the ladel!

I made this for 400 servings and it was a big hit. I made it   for 100 at a time and each time I made it using a different jello flavor.  I do think I will cut back on the sugar next time as it is almost too sweet with the jello, sugar and ginger ale all sweet.  I put it in quart sized zip lock bags and froze them until the event and then just cut the bags and poured the ginger ale over them.  When one flavor was gone we went to another.  We stored them in a cooler so they started getting softer and easy to break up in the punch bowl. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Excellent punch!  I used pineapple gelatin.  A few notes:  This makes 40 *servings* not ounces (I misunderstood and made *way* too much punch!);  the juice mixture refrigerates just fine if you don't want to/can't freeze the whole thing; and this is very sweet - now that we are drinking leftovers I think you could safely use sugar-free gelatin and/or halve the sugar.

I can't believe more people haven't tried this recipe.... it really is the BEST.  It makes kind of that neat "chewy" slushy consistency.  It's more trouble than some other punch recipes, but that's primarily because of the volume of liquid you're working with (to mix as well as to freeze.)  But I've served it three times now and guests always rave.  Freezing tip:  use casserole/baking pans lined with foil so you can lift out the frozen slabs easily to chop them into your punch bowl.  Or, ice cube trays or muffin pans (unlined) eliminate the need to chop in the first place.  (But boy, you'd need a lot of them!)

My mother has had this recipe for years.  It is truly wonderful.  You just have to prepare it in advance because it has to freeze.  People can't stop drinking it.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I read the reviews and altered the recipe by only cutting back on the sugar by half.  This was a wonderful punch.  Will definitely make this again.

Great punch recipe. I usually always have some stored in my freezer just in case I need it! Freeze it in large ziplock bags that have the pleated bottom and the zipper at the top. I have never had a problem with them.

This punch is the best! I made this punch this weekend for my daughter's graduation party. After reading all of the reviews, I was hoping that my guests would be just as pleased. Every single person commented on this punch and wanted to know what was in it.   I followed the recipe and made a few adjustmens that other reviewers made and it came out PERFECT!   I used raspberry gelatin and used only 1 cup of sugar. After boiling the gelatin, water and sugar, I added the juices and let it cool to room temp. Then I poured the mixture into 2 1-gallon ziplock bags and again let it sit to cool a little more. I froze the bags overnight and although they still weren't rock hard by my party, I took them out exactly 2 hours before the party. I poured in 1 2-liter bottle of gingerale for 1 bag of mixture and the consistency was perfect! It was a juice/slushy mixture and kept cold for the whole time. And the sweetness was just enough, not too sweet so 1 cup of sugar was sufficient. Anymore than 1 cup would have been too sweet.   Thanks for a wonderful recipe! This will be my go to punch recipe from now on!!!

Best punch ever........it was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. My friend had like 10 cups str8 and then the next day my husband finished up the rest. I kept sum frozen and when I was ready to drink it I let it defrost a lil bit and added my ginger ale, it was awesome. Will be doing this at all my gatherings......and its also good when u substitute barcardi rum instead of the ginger ale. :)

This is a delicious, icy punch, great for a hot summer day.  Be sure to freeze it in a container you'll be able to get it out of easily (not plastic milk jugs!)  Use different flavors of gelatin for different flavors of punch.

I've made this punch for 2 years now. I LOVE IT! EVERYONE loves it! I inadvertently made a single batch (40 servings) stretch over several holidays. I pour the hot mixture into ice cubes trays & freeze them.(40 servings will fill about 15 ice trays.) I then transfer the formed cubes into gallons bags to keep in my freezer. About 3 trays will fill a gallon bag. When I want punch, I put 1 gal. bag in my punchbowl & pour 3 liters of chilled ginger ale or pineapple soda over the cubes, stir, (if it sets for a few minutes before serving, its better.) serve, & immediately refill the bowl with more soda until its full again. The remaining cubes will gradually melt into the soda. I refill the punch bowl as needed. SO...I am using WAY more gingerale than the recipe calls for, yet, I always get all the amazing compliments, just as all the other reviews have stated.I have about 15 gal. bags of punch cubes that I'm using about 2, 2 liters of gingerale per gallon bag. Yielding 5 bowls of punch. I have punch for Thanksgiving, Christmas, AND New Years. I won't change my ways now, I stumbled upon an awesome thing here. I couldn't even imagine having the punch any more concentrated. People usually have several glasses & are shocked at themselves for having so much, but it's not overly sweet this way & I think people really enough it more. I will NEVER search for another punch recipe again. This one ROCKS! Thank you for posting it!!!!

This punch is very good!  I love the slightly "chewy" slush the jello gives it.  After reading a lot of reviews I was ready to halve the sugar.  After mixing it all, I thought it needed more sugar...so I ended up adding a total of 3 cups sugar.  You have to remember...there is a 16 oz bottle of lemon juice in this!  So there is a lot of tartness in it.   My punch tasted great and the guests loved it....but, personally, I think even if you put the 4 cups sugar it would be great!  I would NOT do 2 cups...waaaay too tart that way in my opinion.  Oh, and I used 2 strawberry and 1 raspberry.  Next time I think I will use just strawberry or the mixed fruit flavor jello.

I made this punch for a baby shower yesterday and everyone RAVED over it. I used berry blue jello (keeping with the baby boy theme)butI should have known it would turn green when the pineapple juice was added.  However, it was a beautiful shade of turquoise. I floated some orange slices on top and it was a great presentation. As noted in other reviews, I cut the sugar to three cups.  I froze the punch in two gallon zip lock bags and it took about 4-1/2 hours to thaw to a slushy consistency.  I will never have to look for another punch recipe again.  This one is it!

My teenage kids love this punch.  I freeze it in ziplock bags--one batch makes 3 ziplock bags.  Then I get it out when they have kids over-- and everyone loves it.  I just mix it with gingerale in a pitcher and it is perfect!

This is a most have punch! I was weary about the Jello part but just like everyone else says here, it turn into a nice slushy drink. A lot of my guests was amazed that the slush look like ice and how tasty it was. It was a blast hit! Better yet, to spice up the party we had made another bunch one with liquor and Bacardi rum. BEWARE as this punch will make your guest go bonkers as u cannot taste the liquor and the flavor makes you have drinking to many! I think we had to take a five and hide the punch after guest was throwing paper-plates lol! Place a warning sign on punch because it makes anyone act foolish LOL. Other then that it's a must have large parties. Also, do add LESS sugar.. 5 Star! That's for the recipe. I will use this again!

AWESOME punch!! I had this at my baby shower and I was addicted to it. I drank it ALL day and was so sad when it was gone. Everyone else loved it as well!  I followed other reviewers advice and bought 3 ginger ales and froze the punch starter in 3 different zip lock bags , laying them flat to freeze overnight. Then took them out a few hours before to let them get a little slushy (put them in the fridge if they get too slushy) and then chopped them up into 1 ginger ale at party time!  I used 2 watermelon and one strawberry jello trying for a pink color, it was close, but lighter then Id like.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

I used a version of this recipe for the punch for my daughter's April 5th wedding, and it was very successful! 

To make the color coordinate with a lavender/silver theme, I used 1 box of lemon jello and 2 boxes of pineapple. Combining tips from others who had tried it, I left out ALL the sugar and used 8 ounces of "Santa Cruz Organic 100% Lemon Juice Not From Concentrate" per recipe. I divided the punch into three, 1-gallon, bags to freeze it (about 7 1/2 cups per bag.) To serve, the punch was thawed for a couple of hours, and then each bag was combined with one 2-liter bottle of chilled ginger ale. When we needed to speed up the thawing process, we put the punch bowl in a hot water bath in the sink and broke up/stirred the punch base as it thawed.

This was a little more expensive than some punches, but we needed a dairy-free punch, and this one worked well!

This is the best punch!  I also reduced the sugar, and I freeze in ziploc bags.  I always have a bag in my freezer for family parties.  I made this for a wedding shower and have been asked for it again and again since. I'm making it this weekend for the baby shower... Also, we divided the punch in half and added champagne to the "adult" punch bowl!  Delicious!

The best punch ever!
I freeze the jello misture the day before so it is perfect by the next day. I also sometimes substitute Sprite for Gingerale and sometimes use both. Makes a TON!!!!!! Make sure you have a HUGE punch bowl (and something else) :) 
Everyone that tries it LOVES it!

This recipe was awesome! Everyone loved it! The only minor problem I had was that when I placed the punch in the freezer, It did not freeze in 2 hours! It took more like 6 hours! But it was still a success at the bridal shower I hosted.

This is delicious! We served it for our 3 daughters wedding receptions. One's colors were lavender and purple, so we mixed the strawberry gelatin with enough boiling water to dissolve it, then added grape juice. We also have a large freezer so we poured it in plastic buckets,(we quadrupled the recipe) and covered with heavy duty foil.  When it would start freezing around the edges, we would stir it,  replace the foil and continued to stir each time it would freeze around the edges until the whole container was frozen.( this is actually the way we made slushys when I worked at a dairy bar back in the early 60's as a teen) This way it never froze solid, but was like a slushy (eliminating the need for chopping, and in my opinion is tastier).We spooned it into the punch bowl and added chilled ginger ale, lemon lime soda is also good, and cheaper.We had so much left over from one of the weddings, that we froze it and 2 weeks later when my friend had a smaller reception we served it at hers.

Excellent!  I made this for my niece's surprise birthday party and everyone loved it.  I used half of the sugar called for and stuck with the ginger ale!  It wasn't too sweet and wasn't too acidic.

i thought it was good!  a little work seperating and all, but the day of the party was easier this way...usually i'm still mixing up the punch when people start to arrive since i'm always late!  anyways, i divided into 4 freezer bags so i could evenly divide it into the punch bowl with 1 bottle ginger ale/2 freezer bags.  i used 2 1/2 cups sugar & the 2 strawberry 1 raspberry jellos.  i placed the bags in the freezer about 1pm the day before the party & took it out of the freezer at about 12pm the day of the party & the party was at 3pm.  they weren't completely frozen solid but mostly froze.  i used the least frozen bags in the first bowl & reserved the more frozen 2 in the utility sink for later...and i did need them cus everyone did love the punch!  it tasted like a fruit punch slushy i thought.  definitely will make again, my boys want me to try grape next time.

WONDERFUL!!! I requested that this punch be made for my wedding by one of my mother-in-law's friends --- I was not disappointed!! We had over 200 guests in attendance at the reception and EVERYONE LOVED this punch. We still get compliments on it and asked for the recipe. We used a strawberry jello mix since my colors were coral and yellow, but I think raspberry would have been just as delicious. This recipe is a must, I'll never use anything else.

I made a version of this punch for a 70th birthday party, and it was a huge hit.  Because my children don't like pineapple juice, we used strawberry/kiwi juice instead, and still included the lemon juice. We used sugar-free Jello (strawberry, black cherry, and raspberry) and Sprite Zero to keep the sugar content down, and cut the sugar down to between 2.5 and 3 cups.  I divided the punch into 6 Ziploc bags, and froze for about 24 hours. The night before the party, I placed all the bags in the refrigerator, and they were the perfect consistency the next day. We used less soda than the recipe called for, just going by taste.  It wasn't too sweet and it had a nice tang to it.  Both kids and adults really enjoyed it - everyone who tried it had at least 2-3 servings.  I would definitely make this again.

I served this at a baby shower and it got rave reviews... I should have made a double batch, it went so quickly!  I used half the sugar recommended, and it was still very sweet.  Next time I will use 1/3 of the sugar in the recipe, and I think that will be perfect.  I also froze the gelatin mixture in ice cube trays and portioned tupperware containers so I had some smaller frozen pieces in the punch bowl.

Absolutely loved this! So did all of our party cause it was GONE! I made it as stated except I halved the recipe (which it made one full punch bowl still!) I also halved the sugar- so a total of one heaping cup. I used strawberry and raspberry jello.

Made this punch for my daughter's sweet 16 party.  Received many comments and two people asked for the recipe.  I followed advice of other reviews and used two packets of raspberry and one strawberry.  I also used 3 ziploc bags to freeze the punch in and added 1 bottle of ginger ale per bag.  And, I also made green punch just by using 3 packets of lime jello.  I served the red punch at the party and that was plenty, I really didn't need to double the punch at all.  However, after we got home, we had several guest and they made the green punch and loved it.  They said it was better than the red.  Thanks for a great punch recipe!

I made this punch for my son's 8th birthday party and it was a big hit!! I chose this recipe because my kids do not like the flavor of kool-aid or fruit punch. You can customize this punch with the jello. I chose 2 strawberries and 1 cranberry. Like other reviewers I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups and it was still quite sweet. I divided the punch into 3(gallon size) freezer bags on a Thursday night. Saturday morning I placed them on the counter around 1100 for a 4pm party and once the ginger ale was added,it was perfect. My 15 year old son said the punch was addicting and the sodas went untouched. My sister requested the recipe for her son's 18th birthday party next week!

I made this at my nieces bridal shower, never made punch in my life and it was a hit! everyone loved it. I did cut the sugar.. for 150 people it called for 15 cups and I only used 6 cups. And it was just so perfect! I do advise you do this,I noticed alot of people cut the sugar because if not it is "too" sweet. On the jello jelatin I used 9 boxes of mixed fruit flavor and 2 boxes of cherry.

I had a party and made this punch mostly for the kids. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 C less sugar. I wish I had made the full batch because within a couple of hours, it was gone!  Both kids and adults really enjoyed it.This will go on my favorite list, it is delicious. I used raspberry and strawberry gelatin and it was perfect.

I made this punch and it was delicious.  It stays well in the freezer and you can pull it out and make it for different occasions.  The sweetness offsets the sour for the perfect combination. You have to try it.

my friend made this and i had to come on and save it to my box. This is a great punch. I would have gave it 5 stars but she decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups. And it was perfect like that. Used 2 strawberry and 1 rasberry jello....so good. I will be making this for Christmas this year.

I made this a few nights ago for a party with a bunch of teenage girls and their mothers. It was a hit! We were following a "P" theme, so we called it "Pucker-Up Party Punch". The only changes I made were to cut the sugar in half (good move, in my opinion!) and divide the mixture up into 4 gallon sized bags to freeze in smaller portions. We used a regular sized punch bowl, and two bags (half of one recipe) plus one bottle of soda filled the bowl perfectly. We made it up the night before, and pulled the bags out of the freezer a few hours before the party to allow the mixture to soften a little bit. Oh, and we used "Blackberry Fusion" Jell-o. Also, for those of you worried about acidity of things like this, it wasn't bad! I expected it would have been a lot worse, but it didn't burn at all! ;)

Very, very good.  I received only compliments and requests for this recipe.  My suggestion:  I froze the punch in ice cube trays.  This way I did not have to do any chopping.  Just drop them into a pitcher/bowel and add the ginger ale.

I made a double batch for my parents' 70th wedding anniversary.  I added a carton of orange juice and 2 teaphoons of almond extract, then made my ice ring of punch with whole maraschino cherries, pineapple rings, and thin orange slices.  The presentation was as good as the punch! Despite the delicious other drinks we offered, this punch was by far the favorite.  I was pleased as punch!!

THIS IS THE BOMB!!  Everyone loved it at a baby shower at my house.  They kept asking for the recipe!!  I would make this again and again!!  It smelled weird mixing the pineapple juice with the lemon concentrate....but it is EXCELLENT - no weird smell after freezing.  I USED ONLY 2 CUPS of sugar and it was perfect.  I used raspberry jello mix.  People drank it so fast it seemed I had more frozen stuff than gingerale - you could easily use 3 bottles of gingerale to the same amount of frozen stuff - in fact I added about 6 cans of Siera Mist to the remaining frozen stuff and it was fine.... MAKE IT!!  YOUR GUESTS WILL LOVE IT AND THINK YOU ARE THE HOSTESS WITH THE MOSTEST!! I froze the frozen stuff in 4 separate dishes and chiseled it apart and then it gets nice a slushy!  Make it ya'll!!

AWESOME PUNCH!!! This turned out amazing, and I didn't change a thing, I left the sugar in and it was the right sweetness. People couldn't stop raving about it at my thanksgiving dinner. I cut the recipe in half and it serves 16 guests perfectly, had plenty left for seconds and thirds even for those who wanted it.

I made this for my daughter's Sweet 16 party. I used 2 raspberry and 1 strawberry flavored jello mix. As other reviewers stated it was too sweet, so, I used 3 cups of sugar. It turned out very good. I put it in 3 gallon size ziploc freezer bags and laid flat in the freezer. Everyone at the party loved it and was all gone! This will be the punch I'll make from no on. Can't wait to try other flavors of gelatin

I made this punch for thanksgiving and it was perfect! I used a large stock pot to mix the ingredients, because my punch bowl was too small. I then had my hubby help me pour into a small container and then pour into 2 gallon sized freezer bags before freezing. I recommend making this the night before because it took at least 12 hours to freeze. I also used 7up and 2 strawberry and one raspberry jello pack. Can't wait to make more at our Christmas party.

This punch is delicious! We used it at a couples meeting at church and everyone loved it. my only change would be to use half the sugar since the Gin is sweet enough.

I have made this recipe for Girl Scouts in the past every time there is an event; I hear we want you to make the punch! In a few weeks my Daughter graduates and she has already said "THAT PUNCH MOM" you have to make "OUR Punch"!  Well the party also includes her Grandparents 50th Anniversary so we will be making more then a double or triple batch. And it didn't take much for her to over ride Grandmas punch recipe.   I truly like the idea of using freezer bags- even though I sell Tupperware. I used a larger containers the last few times, but if you don't give enough time to thaw you run into problems. So this time I will use freezer bags and carry them in Tupperware- just in case they leak. :)  I also like the idea of smaller versions frozen for use at home on a hot summer evenings adding a can of ginger ale or sprite. Never seem to have leftovers. I use the recipe just as it calls using Strawberry or Raspberry Jell-O and I do not cut down on the sugar. Now I can't wait to have some punch.

I did not enjoy this punch nor did my family. It stayed in the refrig until I threw it away. I enjoyed the slushy affect, but the gelatin mix was too heavy, I guess.... I will not make it again.

Not much of a punch drinker and boy was this good, had to make three more batches for the kids gobbled it up during our thanksgiving dinner. I used orange and raspberry gelatin and only two cups of the sugar. I also added fresh orange and strawberry slices and thawed it out a bit prior to mixing the gingerale as suggested by others.

I gave this recipe four stars because I didn't think it was as wonderful as most reviews make it out to be, but I'm admittedly not a punch person.  I've had punches that I do enjoy, but I'm really not a fan of the ginger ale + sorbet/juice/whatever-you-have-on-hand punch kind of person.  I made two batches of this to discover that it was MORE than enough so I kept the ice cubes in freezer bags in the freezer.. Any time my husband would fix a drink (tea, juice, soda, etc) he'd pop a few of these in there to add a little something extra.  I must admit - the tea version was very good!

Made this for my daughter's wedding. Everyone loved it...and received requests for the recipe. I cut the sugar quantity in half. And I made one batch with lime gelatin and one batch with berry. Both were de-lish!

Loved it!  while I was preparing the jello mixture ( it makes alot!) I was kinda worried about what I just got myself into.  But luckily I conitued and froze the mixture in gallon size bags (I think it made 4 or 5 bags), froze them flat in the freezer a couple of days ahead of time.  Day of the party I took them out to thaw about 2 hours prior and they were easily broken up.  Everyone who saw the mixture before hand thought it was a little weird. Once it was all prepared, everyone loved it!  So many compliments.  Just a few drops were left. I used 2 rasberry's and 1 orange jello.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will use this punch recipe from now on.

This punch recipe totally ROCKS! I made it for a baby shower and everyone was raving about it and asking for the recipe. I halved the recipe and had plenty for 13 ladies who all had more than one glass. It was so good that I'm going to make it at Thanksgiving.

Great punch!!  Make sure you have an extra bottle of gingerale on hand as I needed 3 bottles ~ probably since I only took out of the freezer 2 hours in advance.

Great Punch. I made it for my son's graduation open house last year and am making it again this year for my other son's open house because it was such a big hit. I took the advice of freezing it in quart size ziplocs. Remember to thaw 4-6 hours before serving.

I'm not quite sure why this punch is rated so high by most people.  I tested this recipe for my daughters graduation party and I'm glad i did because we did not care for it.  I have some frozen left maybe I will try it with 7up instead of the ginger ale.  Even so I make a much much better punch and will stick with that.

I have made this punch several times and it is always a hit.  My son's teenage friends LOVE it.  Our favorite is with strawberry/banana jello.  We half the sugar as others have suggested. Definitely one to keep in you recipe folder.

I made this for my daughter's grad party. The colour was purple, so I used grape jello. Handy that is can be made ahead of time. The recipe says its 40 (4 oz) servings. It's really double that! I ONLY USED HALF THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR AND EVEN THAT WAS TOO SWEET! You can use 1/3 cup well-rounded bulk jello mix per box called for.

I made this recipe for a party.  I used strawberry and raspberry Jello, but only half the sugar.  I added Sky pineapple vodka with the ginger ale. People raved about it, and everybody liked the slushy texture. It all went.

It was a hit with party guests, but a bit too sweet for my liking.  Couldn't drink more than one small glass.  Definitely recommend freezing in ziploc bag portions.

I was so excited to have a new punch recipe that it seemed everyone enjoyed. I was very let down. I made this for Christmas. I made this recipe as is... First of all when they say large bowl it needs to be really really large. Mine ended up in a big stew pot, because non of my bowls were large enough for all the liquid. Second, cut the sugar, WAYYYY too sweet!!!! Luckily I bought extra ginger ale and you could make a tolerable glass with half ginger ale and half punch. I was also hesitant because of the gelatin. And I didn't really end up liking that either. It tasted like I was drinking Jello. I gave it two stars because the kids drank it. Another tip, take the frozen punch out a little early to slightly thaw, so you don't have issues.

I'm not sure what was 'off' in this recipe but I think it may have been the cranberry jello that made it taste 'off' to me. I used 2 boxes raspberry and 1 box cranberry and decreased sugar to 2 cups. I will try this again but next time I will use 3 boxes of mixed fruit.

Great punch. Have made this recipe several times. Only thing... be careful about the gelatin colours used if substituting. I mixed grape and orange jello, still tastes great but has a very unappetizing brown colour. To compensate, I added a whole jar of maraschino cherries and some red food colouring. Then it was semi-pinkish. The cherries really added to the punch and helped the colour - so I've kept adding them anyhow. I only add them at the end though - not freezing the cherries.

This punch is wonderful!!!  I used strawberry jello for my daughter's baby shower.  I made it as shown using 3 gallon size freezer bags.  Be sure to take bags out of the freezer at least 3 hours before adding the ginger ale in the punch bowl!  Everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe.

This punch was amazing! It was my first time making punch and it was a real hit, everyone was wanting more and more! I had to convert some of the measurments so I could understand them better; I used 2 (1L) cartons of Dole Pinapple Juice, and 1 can of frozen Minute Maid Lemon concentrate. It worked out perfect! Thanks!

I was a little hesitant to make this for my daughter's graduation party last weekend since it was so different from most punch recipes, but it was a HUGE hit!  Yes, reduce the sugar to 3 cups, not 4, and add a little more ginger ale.  I used raspberry, strawberry and cherry jell-o.  The 'slushiness' of the punch was great!  And the left over 'punch base' can just stay in the freezer.

This is THE BEST punch ever. I love the slushy texture and sweet-tart flavor. I used 3 boxes of sugar-free lemon jell-o and reduced the sugar by one cup. I would recommend making this more than a day in advance, to provide plenty of freeze time. I divided mine into two gallon-sized freezer bags, which worked great. Next time, though, I'm going to divide it into quart-sized freezer bags so I can pull it out with just a can or two of gingerale to serve my family of four. This punch is too good to save for special occasions!

You know with this many awesome reviews you have to try it!  We served this at my wedding reception and it was a huge hit (we used only 2c sugar as most others have mentioned 4c would be way to sweet for most people).  I'm making it again for New Year's Eve because it is a great non-alcoholic alternative (but can also be spiked if desired :-)  This is also very economical for a large group and really is not that much work...so long as you can follow simple instructions and the advice of other reviews!  Garnish with lemons, limes, and strawberries for eye appeal :0)

This is the best punch, hands down.  Delicious, I can't say enough.  I put it in 3 gallon size freezer bags.  I serve a whole bottle of ginger ale with each bag.  When the bags freeze on their sides, it freezes the punch thinner than a container, so it's not so hard to break up the mass.  SO DELICIOUS!

This is great! I know people don't care for changes but this is also good with 1-6oz Strawberry Jell-O & 1-3oz box Raspberry Jell-O. Also half lemon/half lime concentrate. And of course, a bottle of good rum.

If I could give this 1000 stars I would! This was so easy to make, and soooooo delicious, I had so many people compliment this punch at my daughters party, I'm also making copies for a few moms right now! lol. I cut the sugar down to 3 cups, and used 3 gallon bags to freeze the liquid, I took the punch out of the freezer way late, but after a few good pokes with a huge fork and pouring the ginger ale it slushed up nicely! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Tried this recipe for my daughter's graduation party. It was delicious. I froze the mixture in quart ziploc bags in advance and on the day of the party placed them in a cooler about 3 hours before I was ready to mix the punch. It was so good!!! I made 2 different kinds before the night was over. Guests loved it. I will use this again and again and again!!

I made this for a group that ranged in age from 10 - 65 years plus and it was a big hit.  Some of the older generation found it to be a bit too sweet, however that can easily be remedied by dropping the sugar content a bit, though I would hesitate to eliminate it entirely.  Personally, I loved it and I enjoyed the leftovers for two days afterwards with Malibu Coconut Rum....it was delicious!  I plan on making this again for Christmas.

Fantastic punch that made soo much more than I expected! I did cut out one cup of the sugar and it is still plenty sweet. I also froze the juices in ice cube trays then stored them in ziplock bags until the party. This helped them melt faster into the slushy goodness! I will definitely make this one again!

This punch is amazing, and everyone seems to love it.  I make a lower-sugar version, with only 2 cups of sugar, which is PLENTY.  I also use sugar-free strawberry jello, and sugar-free ginger ale to mix it up.  The result does not tase low-sugar at ALL, and is perfectly sweet enough.

This recipe really makes enough base to go with 6 or 8 2-litre bottles of ginger ale.  I freeze it in about 6 smaller containers, then use it as I need it throughout the summer.  Great recipe!

Party Punch IX FTW. 
I have never made punch before, but I have had a lot of punch. This was my first time. It will never be forgotten. Everyone asked me where I got the recipe. Why bother with other punch recipes? I sure won't. I followed previous reviewer advice and halved the sugar. I use cranberry flavored gelatin.

I made this punch one Christmas for a family holiday party.  It was great!!  It was perfect that you freeze it. Pouring the ginger ale over the frozen punch ensured we had a ice cold beverage at all times.  It tastes great and everyone loved it!

I was looking for a punch recipe for my daughter's graduation party and found this one. I read reviews and also used 2 raspberry jello/ 1 strawberry jello combo and this won RAVE REVIEWS!  I also cut the sugar back to 2 to 2 1/2 cups and this was perfect! Great punch,still plenty sweet but not overly so. My Mom who doesn't generally like punch loved it. ( That's saying something).   My good friend and my niece have asked for the recipe for their graduation and wedding shower and reception. Highly recommend!

Served this for my son's b-day party & everyone loved it. Actually they raved about it. They all wanted to know what was in it & how to make it. It was easy to make & I prepared it the day before. I cut the recipe in 1/2. I used 2 strawberry jellos, 1 cup of sugar & I froze it in ziploc freezer bags like some other reviewers suggested. I added rum to the punch. Delicious!

YUM!  First time I've ever made punch and this was great.  I didn't know what lemon juice concentrate was, so I used a can of frozen lemonade and it came out great.  I took the advice of others by freezing in ziploc bags and removing them about 4 hrs. before the party and by cutting the sugar in 1/2.  It was perfectly slushy and delicious.

Yummy!  Not a drop left!  I also cut the sugar in half.    The juices, ginger ale, and jello add plenty of sugar.

This is an excellent punch.  Still haven't found an easy way to crush it up after adding the ginger ale though.  We had this punch for a party and those who opted to could add different flavors of vodka.  This was extremely good with the Vanilla and Blue Raspberry Vodkas.

I served this punch for my daughter's birthday party.  People really enjoyed it.  It was gone by the end of the party.  I also cut the sugar in half and it tasted just fine.  It was a very nice change.

The texture was great but it took awhile to achieve it. Allow at least an hour for the Ale to melt the frozen pieces. I would freeze all of it in ice cube trays instead of big chunks.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone liked it a lot! i used less sugar as others have suggested and i think i can use even less sugar next time. and like some other have mentioned, the gallon bags take a long time to thaw, so i think i willuse quart ziploc bags only next time.  my friend has already requested that i made this during her bridal shower again!

After reading a few reviews, I decided to make this punch at my niece's bridal shower.  Just like the other reviews everyone at the party loved the punch.  I used sugar free jello and sugar free ginger and the punch was plenty sweet due to the pineapple juice and the 4 cups of sugar.  I divided the punch into two containers to freeze and it made two punch bowls full of punch.  I had a few comment that they preferred this punch to the ones that add ice cream or sherbet.  They said those made them more thirsty and this punch satisfied their thirst.  I will use this one again.

This was just as good as everyone said! I did 1/2 the sugar as some had suggested and used strawberry/kiwi jello flavoring. I did get lots of compliments and actually ran out at one shower!

This punch is so tasty!  I used a new jell-o flavor - a tropical punch flavor.  I also cut back to a little more than 3 cups of sugar per other reviewer's suggestions.  I could only find 15 oz. bottles of lemon juice so that is what i used.  This is best when the mixture is at a "slushy" consistency, and then add ginger ale.  I made it for a class party and the children and adults both loved it.  This will definitely be my punch recipe from now on.  I really like that you can change the flavor depending on which jell-o you choose.

Awesome punch...everyone loved, especially the kids at the bridal shower! I'd also say to only put 1/2 the amount of sugar in, the pineapple juice and pop make it sweet enough.  But other than that delicious!

This was fabulous!!  I served it at a bridal shower and used berry blue jello.  When it was combined with pineapple juice, etc. it made a teal color and matched my theme perfectly.  Even better than the color was the flavor.  I actually had people saying the punch is "amazing".  I will use this again and again.  We totally ran out because everyone was gobbling it up!

I have made this punch twice now. Everyone loves it. It is like a slush until it melts all the way. I have made the base 3 days ahead,so it is also a timesaver. Little tip, if you use berryblue jello- the end result is a pretty green-blue color.

I made this for my sister's wedding.  It was a huge hit.  I used cherry jello and added food coloring to get the right color.  Everyone loved it.  I portioned it into gallon bags for easier thawing and mixing.

I put the gelatin mix into several tupperware containers to freeze. I let it thaw for 2 hours and then put it in the punch bowl. This worked well and was less messy. I also used 3 cups sugar and less lemon juise as per the other reviews.

Everyone loved this punch at my Dad's 60th surprise party. I split each recipe into 3 gallon size freezer bags. About 3 hours before you plan on serving, put a bag in the fridge to start softening. Then, as you make a new batch pull another bag out of the freezer to start thawing on the counter. To help break up the chunks, use a potato masher.

By far the best punch I've ever tasted!  I made it for my youngest daughter's 1st birthday last month and people still tell me how awesome my punch was.  We're planning to use it again for New Year's Eve, but adding some liquor for the adults of course.  I highly recommend this punch.  Oh and I used 2 strawberry jellos and 1 orange.  And only 3 cups of sugar, it was plenty!  Perfect!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit.  Really does make 40 servings, though, be forewarned.  Didn't own a bowl large enough to make all of the mix in!  Also, might be a little too tart, I think I'll cut back on the lemon juice next time (of course, I also used cranberry jello, so I bet that contributed too!)

absolutely amazing! made it for my boyfriend's sister's 21st, and spent the entire party being complimented on the AMAZING punch. :) really is one of those amazing recipes which have ZERO difficulty, but will really wow a crowd. another thing is that there ended up being a lot of alcohol left over because everyone was drinking this yummy punch, so this will be a good punch to have at a party if you don't want people to automatically head for the booze.;)

I am from New Zealand, so some of the ingredients were a little different:
3x 85g boxes of gelatine mix (I used raspberry which made it such a pretty pink colour)
two cartons of Charlie's crushed pineapple juice. (this is better than the 'pineapple juice with apple base' stuff)
1 (500ml) bottle lemon cordial concentrate (couldn't find lemon juice concentrate)
and I used the 2 litre bottles of Schwepps gingerbeer.

I used only one cup of sugar, and it was still very sweet, with a little bit of bite. remember if you use cordial concentrate instead of pure lemon juice concentrate you should definately cut down the sugar.
anyway, thanks for the recipe! it's officially my favourite recipe EVER!

This is wonderful! I used cranberry jello, and 3 cups sugar instead of 4. I didn't break up the frozen mixture enough, so I wound up using 4 bottles of ginger ale for one batch. I definitely plan to use this recipe again!

I have had something similar.  I use 1  12oz. Can frozen orange juice, 1pkg regular kool aide (any fruit flavor), 1 2liter bottle ginger ale or sprite. And add sherbet  to float.  Has less sugar in it and still sweet.

Made a lower sugar version of this recipe! I used sugar free jello, splenda instead of sugar and diet ginger ale for one batch and sprite zero for another. Delicious!!!!! Not totally sugar free, but better gor those that have to watch their sugar.

I cut the sugar back to 2 cups - still plenty sweet. This makes 40, 8-ounce servings (not 4-ounce servings). Served it at daughter's wedding, and got many, many comments on how delicious it was!

This was the BEST punch I have ever made! My guests raved about it. I froze it into ice cube trays and then put them in zipper bags once frozen. Worked great but it took a lot of time. It made a lot of punch! We had about 35 guests and only used about half of the punch.

I figured at the end of the day, punch is punch. But people were camped out around the punch bowl until they drained all of it.

I used 2 boxes of raspberry jello and cut the sugar in half, which was perfect. We did not have a single bowl large enough to fit all of the ingredients, but we managed. Also, I followed the advice to use ziplock bags - quart size. Also, you could use 3(2 liter) bottles of ginger ale with this recipe size.

Good luck!

Most recipes are much the same. This one takes the cake! Most recipes are much the same. Made it for a retirement party and people couldn't stop talking about it. Takes more prep, but well worth it if you want something special.

This was a really great punch recipe. We divided it up in quart-size freezer bags -- enough to serve in one pitcher at a time. Young and old enjoyed it.

Excellent punch! The only thing I'd change is adding a bit less pineapple juice; it was slightly overpowering. I had to make punch for a fundraiser with over 80 guests and this recipe really came through for me. I stored the gelatin mixture in large zip-lock bags and let them freeze overnight. Because I had so many of them, by the time the fundraiser came around they were still only slush! But that worked for the better, because the slush incorporated into the gingerale a lot better than a big icy block would. I'll definitely use this recipe for all my punch needs!

So delicious! I made this for a house party with over 50 people and it disappeared shortly after I put it out!  The kids had a blast helping me break up the frozen juice, and it had a great slushy consistency. I'm definitely going to use this as my go-to punch recipe from now on.

I made this for my neices bridal shower.  It was great.  We only had about 1 1/2 cups left at the end of 3 hours with 20 woman.  I had two 2 gallon zip lock bags and poured the punch into them and layed them flat in my freezer. About 1 1/2 hours before the party i got them out and they were very easy to break apart in time for the party.  Less to clean up, too. Just tossed the bags in the trash when we were done. Definetly a recipe to try!

This was a HUGE HIT. First attempt to making punch and everyone LOVED it. The only thing I would do differently is use less sugar. Taste great as slushy and regular punch. It even taste great spiked with Captain Morgan. It's a WIN WIN PUNCH!!!

In a family that does not like change, I was excited when I served this recipe for a shower and everyone kept commenting on how yummy it was.  I used strawberry jello and followed the recipe.  However, when I froze the base, a lot of the sweetness settled to the bottom.  My second batch was far sweeter than the first and needed extra Ginger Ale to soften it a bit.  I would recommend having two extra liters of Ginger Ale for those who don't want their punch so sweet.

This was a huge hit at my mother-in-laws 80th birthday party.  I had a lot left so I left it for our church to use and it was a hit there as well.  Anyone looking for a party punch recipe to wow a crowd should try this one.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I made this for my sister's baby shower and everyone loved it!! We considered cutting the recipe in half since it seemed like it would make a lot but I'm glad we didn't! We had very little left. We had about 20 people there. I'd like to try different gelatins next time, I used 2 rasberry and 1 strawberry. This was so good!!!!!

I made this for Halloween and it was a hit. I used 2 boxes of Strawberry jello and 1 box of lime. I only had 4oz of lemonade so that is all I used. I added green food coloring and floated frozen (with red food coloring) hand shaped ice in the punch and the kids thought it was awesome. We named in swamp punch to go along with all the creepy named foods we had. I'm making this again in the same manner for our company party this week. This is a keeper!

While it is true that this is not the easiest punch to make, it is very much worth the extra effort.  I also got many raves and requests for the recipe at the shower I made this for.

The best part was that the left over punch kept for a week in the fridge and even stayed bubbly, my kids were thrilled!

This was a hit at a bridal shower I had, I did add fresh chopped strawberries. I got many compliments. After a few asked for the recipe I told them, they thought it was too much trouble, but for me this is the only punch I'm serving for my parties. By the way this is not for diabetics! Try working with sugar free jello as others have.

Yummy! Very sweet. I had a hard time getting it frozen out of the container. Made a bit of a mess. I used pineapple jello  and added frozen raspberries to it when done for presentation.

This was a hit at my party. I added scoops of vanilla ice cream to the top to make it festive--and some guests added a little vodka to their cups to make a nice holiday-tini!

I made this for a baby shower. It was very tasty and it got alot of compliments.
However, I only gave it three stars because it was not the easiest punch I have ever made. Actually, it was messy. There is so much of it that it is cumbersome to mix and takes a lot of room to freeze. Then, I had to worry about it thawing out enough but not too much. 
As good as it tasted I'm not sure I would go through all that trouble again.

This is excellent.  I served this at a bridal shower and was blown away by all the compliments.  Only change I made was to reduce the sugar by half as someone else recommended.  Also would recommend taking out of freezer at least 4 or 5 hours before use.

Definitely an awesome punch!  I just made it today to share at a friend's birthday party and it was a hit!  I made it with the changes suggested previously, using about 2-2 1/2 cups of sugar.  I was planning to cut back to about three cups, but I ran out in my handy sugar container so I stopped just short of 2.5 cups.  It was still plenty sweet.  I don't think anyone would miss the extra cup and a half!

I used Pineapple Jello because as good as it sounded to have Cranberry, they didn't have any at the store.  I decided to just go with a citrusy punch and Pineapple called my name.

Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe.

This punch was wonderful - best I've ever tasted! I used a mixture of complimenting jello flavors and the result was fabulous! I reccomend the mixed berry and the fruity color changing types. I rec'd SO many compliments from my guests - everylone loved it.

I made this punch for both my workplace and a church function for the young people.  It was a success for both places!  I used lime jello powder both times and the young and old alike really enjoyed the slushy drink. People kept coming back for more 'cept that it was gone in a very short period of time. I had plenty of questions as to how I got the punch so evenly slushy (the mixture just thaws that way plus a diligent helper to mush out the odd lumps :) ) and had a few parents ask me for the recipe.  Overall, I really like this recipe and will make again. Only thing is that I would cut out 0.5 to 1 cup of the sugar out.  When I made it originally, I did take out 1/2 a cup of sugar but thought it a tat too sweet still but everyone else thought it was perfect. Oh well...

Good punch.  You will definitely need extra gingerale.  I decreased the recipe and still needed one whole bottle of gingerale for HALF the frozen mixture.

Absolutely the best!  Since I can't have all the sugar I make it with sugar free cherry gelatin and Truvia instead of regular cherry gelatin and sugar.
It is always requested for every party or shower I attend.

Loved this punch.  The only reason I'm scoring it 4 instead of 5 is that the amount of ginger ale listed isn't near enough.

Wonderful!!  Made it for Thanksgiving dinner for 36 guests and it all disappeared.  Used sugar free jello (2 raspberry and 1 cranberry) and 3 cups of sugar.  Will certainly make it many more times using different jello flavors.

Made enough for 50.  It was enjoyed by all.  The slush is what really makes it!  I used 3 c. sugar and it was plenty sweet.

Very good punch. I used it for my son's ninth birthday party. I used ice cube trays to freeze it! It took quite a few trays but worked out perfectly. I used two packets of raspberry jello and cut back on the sugar and lemon juice a little bit and it was wonderful!

The best punch I have ever made! I've made this 3 times now and each time, plenty of people ask me for the recipe. I did add only 2 cups sugar, rather than the 4 cups. And as for the flavors of Jello, I used strawberry/raspberry and all strawberry. I think I will mix it up next time and try different flavors.

Surprisingly good!  I made this with blue jello for a baby shower (in which the mommy-to-be is expecting a boy, obviously).  The addition of the pineapple juice turned it a little more aqua than blue, but it was still very cute and got great reviews from the shower guests.  I deduct one star only because it's kind of a pain to make (getting it all into the freezer was a hassle).

I made a double batch with Lime and Lemon jello.  I wanted it green for a sweet pea baby shower theme.  It was a mess putting it in the freezer bags (make sure you DOUBLE bag), but it was great making it at the shower and everyone loved it.  I had 30 people and with a double batch - I had none left!  None of the other drinks were touched.  Big hit!

Made this for my twin daughters 5th birthday party.  It was quite a hit.  The adults and kids alike loved it.  It's easy to make and to throw together when you're ready to party.  I took the advice of another reviewer and divided it into several smaller containers and that was much easier to handle than 2 big solid blocks of frozen punch.  Really good--will hold on to this recipe for other parties!

This is the first time I made punch. People raved about it. Have it without alcohol so kids can have it and with vodka on the side for whom likes a bit of liquor in their drink.  It's the first one to go.  Next time I'm buying more ginger ale.  And probably put it in smaller container so it will be even easier.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was ok.  I followed the recipe and used orange Jello, but we all thought it had too much pineapple taste.  Not nearly as good as I expected.

This was a good tasting punch.  I made 2 batches, one lime and one strawberry.  They were both good.  The punch was difficult to prepare.  I had frozen the mixture in gallon size zipper bags. The frozen mixture was too big for the bowl and hard to break apart. If I make this again, I will use quart size bags.

I have to tell you I was a little skeptical about a Jello punch, but, given all the raving reviews I decided to try it.  I made it for my daughter- in- laws baby shower and it was just a good as everyone said it was.  I did take others advice and cut the sugar down to 2 cups.  I might even cut it to 1 next time. It was really good.  Be sure to take it out in plenty of time or it will be too frozen.  I would recommend about 21/2 hour before going to serve.  It was not a hassle at all.  I scooped the mixture out of the large pot with my 4 cup measuring cup and had my husband hold ziplock baggies to fill.  You can warm the frozen mixture up in warm water if necessary for breaking up to put into a bowl.  Got great reviews from guests.

Made this punch at Thanksgiving and everyone...adults and children really liked it. I used 2 cranberry and 1 orange jello. Nice change from the ice cream and sherbert punches. This will be my standard punch recipe from now on.

This was quite good.  I was unable to find gelatin on short notice so I used three packages of Kool-Aid instead.  It turned out well and my guests were happy not to have the same sherbet punch that is usually served at functions.  It made a enough to fill two punchbowls.

I made this for my sister's bridal shower.  I used 1 raspberry and 2 strawberry jellos.  I followed other suggestions and cut the sugar to 2 cups and it was plenty sweet that way.  But it was delicious.  People really liked it.  The volume of liquid was a lot but I like others' ideas about freezing in bags and just adding the ginger ale.  I'll try that next time.

Unique and tasty punch.  I made this for my sister's bridal shower and everyone complimented it.  I did follow suggestions and halfed the sugar.  I also used diet Sprite and sugar free jello instead of full sugar components.  Still very sweet and fizzy.  It did foam a bit when adding the diet Sprite, wasn't a problem but thought I'd mention it.  I'll make this one a keeper in my recipe box!

Served this at a baby shower and would definitely use again. I think I would use 4 freezer bags next time to make it easier to freeze. I did double bag the punch as some of them were leaking in the freezer.  The lemon concentrate that I used was only 15 ounces but I used the same amount of sugar and water as the recipe called for and it was good.

Made it for a Christmas party last weekend. Just as good as all the other reviewers said! It disappeared quickly (even though it didn't have any alcohol in it). :-)  This is now my go-to party punch--bye bye sherbet punch!

This is the best puch recipe; I like to freeze extra in mini molds and put them in ziploc bags in the freezer; I always have gingerale on hand and can make punch for last minute guests.  It is delicious; everyone raves about it.

I made two batches of this punch for our housewarming party, and we still ran out!  I had to use a neighbor's freezer to hold it all, but it was worth it!  I took it out in the morning as others suggested and broke it up in chunks prior to putting it in the punch bowl.  I could hardly keep it stocked and people are still talking about it asking for the recipe a week later.  I had lots of yummy food (all from this site) and people liked the punch the best.  This will be the only punch recipe I make from now on.  Thanks for sharing it.

This was the hit of the party!  Everyone loved it and thought it was a dessert in and of itself!  I used sugar-free strawberry banana gelatin and 3 c sugar.  It thought it was a good level of sweetness.  The hardest part of the punch to me was keeping it stocked, seriously!  I didn't have a punch bowl, so used a couple of carafes, and every time I turned around for the first half hour, I would fill one up and by the time I mixed the other one, I would head in with the first to fill it.  I didn't want to mix it all up at once and lose the slushiness, but I would definitely suggest having a large punch bowl or something so that you don't have to stay away from your party for the first half hour or so!  Many said this was the best punch they had ever had and all the girls asked for the recipe.

This punch was so easy to make.  I mixed up the ingredients to be frozen the day before.  About 15 minutes before party time, I put it in a punch bowl, chopped it into chunks, poured in the ginger ale and presto, great punch.  The frozen mixture continues to break apart and keeps the punch icy.  Everyone loved this.  I will keep this receipe handy!

This punch is very good. We reduced the recipe from 4 to 2 cups of sugar, but it still seemed too sweet. I will definitely reduce (or maybe eliminate) the sugar next time. Thank you for a tasty party drink!

This was really good and super easy. I divided the punch into 2 containers and froze them. You can use any flavour of Jello powder. I used grape and cherry and it was great! Definitely make sure to take it out at least 2 hours before adding the ginger ale.

I scaled down the recipe to just one pack of jello-- just to try for my husband and I.  I only added about 1/3 of the sugar and froze the jello mixture in ice cube trays and muffin tins....easier for single servings.  Even that made alot so I'm just going to store the cubes in my freezer for a treat anytime.  This would be great for a party and you could probably freeze it into a ring to look pretty.

My family can’t get enough of this punch!  They request it for every holiday and birthday.  I have been making this for YEARS.  The only change I’ve made is opting to not freeze it. Thanks for sharing such an easy, versatile, and tasty recipe.

Terrific punch - used raspberry jello and half the sugar - everyone loved it.  Freezing the punch base is key.

I made this for a pool and lunch ladies birthday party. Hot hot hot outside so this slushy punch sounded great. And it was. Everyone enjoyed it and I froze whole strawberries for the drinks and also had some cut up that were frozen. I reduced the sugar to two cups and added diet ginger ale. Used regular strawberry jello but next time use the no sugar kind. I thought it was still a bit sweet but it was refreshing and cold to drink around the pool. No need for alcohol to make this a yummy adult drink. Refroze what was left so I’ll have some for next guests  a five star fir sure punch abd do easy.

It was good however no one really raved about it.  I thought it was good but wouldn't drink more than one serving. Made it just as the recipe stated expect used less sugar and I'm glad that I did because it was sweet.

I've made this twice and both times it has been a hit. People now request it and they always ask for the recipe. As advised but other reviewers, I do reduce the amount of sugar by half (2 cups instead of 4) and it's so sweet I can't imagine using all the sugar. Both times I've used 1 jello package of each: strawberry, raspberry, and cherry. Put the frozen punch into the fridge the morning of because it is best when it's melted to just a bit more frozen than a slushie.

Will definitely make again!!! It was easy & delicious! I halved the recipe because it was for a small baby shower. I used 1 box of cherry jello and 1/2 box of lime. I separated the into 2 freezer bags and 1 was enough for a full bowl of punch using 1 2liter of ginger ale. I set out the mix about 4 hrs before party and it was perfect. Tastes like what I had as a child at my ex step-grandparents family gatherings. Yummy!

I made this punch for my wedding 14 years ago--and ever since!  Everyone loves this punch and requests it for showers, retirement parties, graduations, weddings, etc.  I always use strawberry Jello and cut the sugar in half. I use 2 gallon ziplocs to freeze it and add one bottle of gingerale per bag.  BEWARE--you will be asked for this CONSTANTLY!  (It's also great with coconut rum or other alcohol).

I made this recipe several times but I use 2 cans of frozen orange juice concentrate and 2 cans of frozen pink lemonade concentrate instead of the lemon juice concentrate. I also add a 8 quart of kool- aid  fruit punch drink mix or any flavor of your desire to the mixture. It is definitely great for bridal showers, weddings, school functions, and family reunions. I have made it for several occasions and it is always a hit!!!!! Guests are always asking for the recipes or asking for it to be prepared at their next event!

Awesome punch everyone loved it and asked for the recipie.  I changed it a little, instead of adding pineapple juice, I added 1 bottle of apple juice, and 1 bottle of cranberry juice.  For the jello portion, I used 3 boxes of cherry jello, and only 2 cups of sugar.  I will definitely make this punch again, trying different fruit jello types.

This was a huge hit at a birthday party for my son. I made this following the recipe for the mixture ( I used 2 raspberry and 1 lemon jello) and then put the mixture into two freezer bags and into the freezer over night. I pulled one bag out at a time and added 2 L of ginger ale to it and it and each batch made quite a bit of punch. Plus the punch stayed cool the entire party without having to add ice or keep the punch bowl chilled. Got great compliments on it and will be making again. Thank you!

I 1/2 the recipe and freeze about a 1/3rd (before adding the ginger ale)  to put in the punch to keep it chilled. It adds a nice slush as it melts. This quantity fills the punch bowl twice, just enough for my group, who love it.

I use 2 raspberry and 1 strawberry gelatin. I reduce the sugar to 2 cups, and use 8 cups boiling water followed by 5 cups cold water after the gelatin/sugar is dissolved, to hurry the cooling process. Also, I don't think they really mean "lemon juice concentrate" as the recipe states - I use "lemon juice FROM concentrate". Freeze in gallon or quart ziplocs. If the slush is still in one solid chunk after softening several hours in the fridge, put it on the counter and lightly smack it with the side of a hammer a time or two to break it up before adding to the punch bowl. Has anyone tried 2 strawberry and 1 peach gelatin? - I'm afraid to try something new for a big event, but that combo sounds so good to me!  People always rave about this punch at graduation parties - thanks for sharing the recipe!

I make this every year for my bank's Open House. We can hardly keep the punch bowl full! I have customers who ask me all year long when I'm going to make the punch again. They all look forward to it. I've passed this recipe on countless times and have always heard of great results.

I made this punch for a Bunco party and it was a hit! Everyone loved it including me! As per other reviewers, I decided to cut the sugar in half. It was perfect and not too sweet. I used a combination of sugar free jello and the normal (full sugar) jello. I also used both strawberry and raspberry for a full berry taste. Again, everyone loved it! I only made 1/2 of the recipe to serve 12 people and it was just enough. For freezing I only needed 2 gallon size baggies. I placed both of them down on a cookie sheet and placed in my freezer. I noticed it just started to turn 'slushy' after 9 hours. So I would plan at least 12 hours next time. I also made fruit flavored mini ice cubes from a mini bundt/muffin pan. I cut 4 strawberries, divided equally in each section and filled with fruit flavored sparkling water (I used the brand Sparkling ICE). After freezing I added them to my punch bowl along with the punch. It made a beautiful presentation and it kept the punch cold & slushy for hours. Overall this recipe is great for any social gathering, it's a "keeper"!!!

Loved this recipe. I made it with Black Cherry gelatin and froze it in four smaller containers. I then portion it out individually filling about half of a 12oz. glass with the mix and topping with ginger ale or lemon-lime soda. I was warned by the family not to make this too often because it would be the only thing they would drink!

I have made this multiple times, in many flavor combinations and always get asked for the recipe.  People don't believe it all starts with Jello.   -- You can make this with sugar-free Jello,  Splenda, and diet ginger ale.   That way the only sugar is from the pineapple juice.

This punch is REALLY good.  I did cut the sugar to only 3 cups and it is still sweet enough.  I have a really large punch bowl and with one frozen half (set out the morning of the party to thaw a bit), I could only add 1/2 a liter of gingerale.  You could easily half this recipe for a smaller party!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!  Even the adults - bottle of rum stashed up high - loved it.  We left it out all day in a punchbowl and it stayed slurpie consistency for the entire party.  I'm going to make it again this weekend for my sons birthday party. Just for kicks, I'm gonna make it with pineapple jello - get it?  yellow slush?  What a hoot!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and I think everyone mentioned how good it was.  I used a combo of red jellos from my cupboard.  Grocery store was almost out of gingerale, so I had some gingerale and some lemon-lime.  Both are great.  I froze it into 3 servings each in a gallon bag.  Let it thaw out for a bit, then add the soda.  I went through every drop of it for about 20 people, but there was plenty for refills with 20 people:  Everyone kept going back, and back, and back!  Great recipe, easy, and can be made ahead!

Everyone loved this punch. I used Strawberry jello and halved the recipe. I unfortunately had to freeze it in two small chunks and one large chunk due to container availability, but that turned in our favor. I put it in a few hours before we ate Thanksgiving dinner. We broke up the chunks with a butter knife while it melted and it turned into a wonderful slush before we all sat down. Everyone kept drinking it all day. Twenty servings comfortably fed nine adults.

I made this punch for a wedding shower I was hosting and it received rave reviews! Some of the girls were even mixing it with champagne for a 'punchy mimosa.' I made my punch with peach jello because I wanted to create a golden 'fall-like' color. It was very easy to make and found storing it in freezer ziploc bags to be perfect. I will definitely make again and experiment with other jello flavors.

I made this for my Mom's 79th birthday party and everyone loved it. I added  3 cups sugar which we thought wasn't enough. I will use 4 cups sugar next time. I used lime jello. I have a sister that is allergic to red 40 dye so most red gelatin has that in it. I will definately make this for Christmas and any other event we have.

Very good, but very sweet.  I used slightly less than 4 c. of sugar, but I would definitely go down to 3 next time.  I made it with Strawberry Daquiri flavored jello for a baby shower and it was a hit.  I let it thaw for about 2 hours in a cooler beforehand, but it was still pretty hard when it was time to make it.  I would suggest letting it thaw for at least 3 hours before you need it.  Towards the end of the shower it finally started getting slushy like it's supposed to be, but it was still very sweet.  I couldn't find lemon juice concentrate like the recipe called for so I used reconstituted lemon juice instead.  The actual concentrate might have cut the sweetness a little, or a little extra ginger ale might have done it also.  Still very good.

I served this at my daughter's christening reception and it was a hit with my in laws. I felt so good about all of the compliments I got. I'd suggest this recipe to anyone. However, I used 1 less cup of sugar, three containers and boy oh boy was the chopping hard work. It was worth it though!

Wonderful punch!  I used cranberry jello and 3 cups sugar.  The only problem is that after serving the punch at Thanksgiving, people have started asking if I'll make it for Christmas, their birthday, weddings, etc.

This was awesome! Everyone loved it and asked to see the recipe. My only problem was that I didn't allow myself enough time for the jello stuff to freeze and I just poured it into the bowl with the ginger ale. I was going to add some fruit to it, but it tasted fruity enough. thanks for a great punch!
