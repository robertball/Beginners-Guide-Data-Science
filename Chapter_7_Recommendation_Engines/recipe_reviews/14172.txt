I scrolled down about 40 reviews looking for someone, anyone, who had actually followed this recipe, but couldn't find one. I, however, followed it to a T - right down to the real anchovies and not anchovy paste. IT WAS EXCELLENT. I've been using an "authentic" caeser recipe for awhile, and this is much, much better (and easier to make). This is going on my list of keepers and will replace any caeser dressing I make in the future.

Whether it's at home or in restaurants, my husband and I are always spoiled by good, fresh, from scratch Caesar dressing. This recipe sounded too good to be true, so curiosity got the better of me and I dared to try it. I scaled this down to 2 servings and, so as not to waste the better part of a can of anchovies, used a little dab of anchovy paste instead.  Outside of the dressing being a little thicker than I liked, which I simply thinned with a little half and half, it was just wonderfully creamy, flavorful and a fine substitute for the "real" thing. So glad I came across this recipe!

This was very good! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put everything in a blender  after chopping the garlic and anchovies. I've made it a second (and now a third) time and a small food processor actually works better than the blender. The ingredients were a little thick and wouldn't blend, so I added a very little bit of milk on the suggestion of another reviewer and a little bit of red wine vinegar. Additionally, I added a couple drops of tabasco. After that, everything blended perfectly. I also used some grated parmesan in the dressing and then added some shredded parmesan after I mixed it with the lettuce. Finally, I also added some extra lemon juice at the end- over the top of the salad. I found that the dressing is better after it sits for a while (!!!) so the flavors can meld (before you add the lettuce), as is usually the case with homemade salad dressings. This was fairly garlicky, but I love garlic and usually add extra to recipes - I didn't add any extra garlic and I really liked this- perfect for me, but would be okay with more garlic as well. Finally, I definitely would keep in the anchovies- If you chop them fine (and I even chopped them before I put them in the blender) you don't even know they're there, it's not fishy, but it does add to the caesar dressing. Also, I found that all of the oil was needed in the blender for it to blend, but in the future, I will add the other ingredients (milk, red wine vinegar) to  get it to blend and then slowly dri

Sound the trumpets! Call off the dogs! The search for the ultimate creamy Caesar dressing is over. This is IT. We love this so much, I always make extra to serve on the side for bread dipping. Like many others, I sub anchovy paste for the anchovies (1/2 teaspoon paste per anchovy) and use parmigiano reggiano with a VERY heavy hand. The croutons are the best I've ever tasted, but this salad can stand on its own without them if you're pressed for time. A sliced roma tomato fanned on the edge of each plate is our favorite addition for both color and taste, but this is such an amazingly good recipe that the possibilities are endless. Grilled shrimp? Crab? Avocado? Karen Weir, you are a certified Caesar genius. Thank you!

I order Caesar salad every time I go out to eat. The dressing rivals anything I've had in a restaurant.  I bake the croutons instead of frying them. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Spray evenly with olive oil-based cooking spray and sprinkle with garlic powder. Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven, turning often, until dry, crisp and golden (about 15-20 minutes). These are nice and crunchy and low in fat.

OK, here's the deal: Against every fiber of my being as a Caesar Salad purist (NO MAYO!) I will give this recipe 5 stars IF all you ANCHOVY HATERS will go directly to your pantry and REMOVE the Worchestershire Sauce. If you wish, you may read the list of ingredients (ANCHOVIES!!) before you toss it in the garbage. If you buy bottled Caesar dressing, read the ingredients CAREFULLY because all that I looked at had anchovies! All kidding aside, this non-traditional Caesar recipe is excellent. The only reason THIS purist is forced to try a mayo version is that my body has played an evil trick on me and messed up my immune system, so my hematologist "prefers" that I skip raw eggs. I made THIS recipe exactly as written (only fair to the submitter if you are going write a review, but don't get me started!) and I REALLY liked it.  Actually, I couldn't bring myself to throw away that browned garlic from the croutons, so I added it, chopped, to the salad. I used a sourdough boule from the day-old rack for the croutons and they were great!  I highly recommend this recipe for those who are sqeamish about raw eggs... but as for the anchovies?  Aw, c'mon... get over yourself and put them in there!  If you don't want to deal with the fillets (which are best, especially in jars packed in oil rather than tins) then just buy a tube of anchovy paste.  It won't taste "fishy"... just a warm saltiness that is quite pleasant!  Thanks, Karen, for a great recipe that I can "live with"!

I am just about the pickiest when it comes to Caesar dressing and I love this one!  This dressing makes you drool and crave a Caesar salad.  It's just the perfect balance of all the ingredients.  Oh...and the homemade garlic croutons are amazing.  

I followed the advice of another reviewer and tossed all the ingredients in the food processor and voila...no fuss, no muss.  I used the shredded Parmesan instead of grated and extra virgin olive oil when making the croutons.  Also, rather than cutting the garlic into quarters...I just took the flat part of my knife and smashed the garlic once.  Make sure you don't let the garlic burn when infusing the oil, otherwise if you do, it's worth tossing it and starting over.  The smashed garlic should be stirred around in the oil and golden brown before removing it for the fullest flavor.  

Try this recipe, guys...you won't regret it!  I'm never buying Caesar dressing in a bottle ever again.  Thanks, Karen, for submitting it!!

For the past couple of months, I have been trying to incorporate more salads into our dinner rotation.  Hubby and I are both fond of Caesar salads and so I chose this salad as tonight’s dinner entrée.  To make this a more “stick to your ribs” dinner, I tossed in some cut up chicken tenders that I pan fried in Old Bay.  I put my romaine in a large plastic bowl and mixed in the dressing until all the leaves were coated. I only used 3 anchovies because I wasn’t sure how strong they would taste.  And I did rinse them off to do away with any “fishy” taste.  Instead of preparing the croutons as this recipe instructed, I used the Garlic Crouton recipe on this site instead.  It was terrific. I definitely recommend this salad to those Caesar lovers out there.  Thank you so much for sharing this one Karen!!

Thanks for the great recipe...I really don't think I will buy ceasar dressing anymore when its this easy (and delicious) to make at home! My only modification was in preparing the croutons since I already have a method I like. I pour the olive oil into a big zip lock bag, then add which ever herbs and spices I'm in the mood for (usually minced garlic or garlic salt, a pinch of crushed rosemary, and/or an Italian herb blend), then add the bread cubes, close the bag and shake it up. That way all the bread gets coated well. Then I stick them in the oven at 325 until they are golden.

Good Caesar recipe if you don't have time to make the dressing from scratch like the traditional Caesar Dressing is made.  Add some grilled chicken to make this a dinner.

I have been using this salad dressing for over a year. It is absolutely the best tasting Caesar Salad Dressing PERIOD. I have read a few reviews that did not use "Real Mayo" or did not use anchovy.Was looking for a lowfat way to make it and rated it low. If you are not going to follow the recipe do not rate it. I myself do not care for anchovy and I did not tell my wife I used it or she would not have tasted it. She loves it and everyone that tastes it HAS TO HAVE THE RECIPE. Follow the directions and it is fabulous. That being said I did up the mayo to 1 cup and added 6 tablespoons of olive oil to the dressing so it is less thick. I followed the recipe the first couple of times and then modified it a pinch. This is one of the best recipes on this site. Thanks Karen. I also forgot to add. I put the anchovy,garlic,olive oil and parmesan cheese in a food processor and almost puree it. I think this really helps with those not liking anchovy.

I make this often, and am at a loss as to why I have never rated it.  I don't like anchovies, my husband doesn't like anchovies, and the FC (finicky child) surely doesn't like anchovies.  This dressing, made as directed, is fabulous.  And guess what, the anchovies add a depth of flavor that is amazing, without tasting like anchovies!!  I gave this recipe to a friend who made it and said it didn't taste like mine.  Well, of course it didn't, she left out the tiny fishies.  I don't add any additional salt and I rinse those little devils because they are so salty.  This is the best Caesar dressing recipe I have ever found.

!WoW! I am a BIG salad dressing person and I LOVE Caesar and this was the REAL DEAL HOLYFIELD!!! I followed this recipe EXACT except that I didn't add extra salt and the taste/texture were perfect. For those complaining about it being too thick, I wonder if they used REAL anchovy fillets. The reason being is that they're mostly sold in tins preserved in oil and when blended with the rest of the ingredients it thins out the mayo mixture. Into a PERFECT creamy dressing consistency. I would advise those who used anchovy paste to use a bit of olive oil instead of milk for a similar effect.
Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this gem of a recipe!!!

UPDATE: I prepared the full recipe to be served with Christmas Eve dinner.I think the recipe, as is, yields WAY TOO MUCH dressing!!!! Add a little at a time, toss with the lettuce and adjust according to your tastes. You don't want soggy salad (yuck!). OMG!!!  What an AWESOME recipe (and I mean AWESOME)!!!  Deserving of 10 stars!  I made this salad to complement the steaks with thyme pan sauce that my bf and I prepared on New Year's Eve.  I halved the recipe, using only 2 anchovy filets (the dressing had just the right amount of anchovy flavor - 3 filets would have been too much).  I added an equal amount of store-bought Caesar croutons to speed things up a bit, rather than making my own.  I sprinkled the salad with a couple tablespoons of shredded Parmesan cheese (the fancy shredded kind), but used the grated kind (from the can) in the dressing itself. I liked this recipe so much, I made it for dinner one night, adding cut up pieces of cooked frozen chicken nuggets to make it more filling.  You could also add grilled chicken (i.e. Louis Rich grilled chicken strips) or fried / grilled shrimp (i.e. package purchased from the frozen section of your supermarket - garlic herb flavor, etc.).  A very impressive and insanely easy recipe.  Thanks SO much for sharing!

For years I've made authentic Caesar salad, which includes a raw egg yolk in the dressing.  A recent bout of salmonella (not to mention fear of Avian flu since I live in Asia at the moment) convinced me that it was time to find a new recipe.  Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I were keen on this one.  The flavor was good, if perhaps a bit too garlic-y, but the consistency of the dressing was too thick.  It was almost like tossing the romaine lettuce with straight mayonaise.  I think I'll revisit my old recipe (which has an oil base) and try substituting 1 T of mayo for the egg yolk.  Obviously I'm in the minority here--this recipe got rave reviews--but heads up to anyone seeking a more traditional Caesar salad dressing, this is not it.

Great recipe.  I too found it a little thick but just added a little more olive oil to thin it down a bit.  Also, I substituted anchovy paste which is just as good.
Will make again for sure!  Thanks.

Wow!  This salad dressing is great.  So easy to make and one of the best caesar dressings I've ever tasted.  I didnt change a thing except I used 2 tsp. of anchovy paste instead of the fillets.  It does not need anything to thin it, the consistency was perfect.  I will honestly never use botttled caesar dressing again.  It had just the right amount of "kick", and the greatest part... I knew exactly what I was eating.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

OMG!  Thank you Thank you Thank you! Best Caesar Dressing I have had in Years!  We used to get a Great Caesar Salad with the best dressing in Houston several years ago.  the restaurant has since closed up but have been looking since then to find a good Caesar dressing.  This one is Fabulous!  Very simple and most of the ingredients I had on hand.  I did use anchovy paste in place of fillets. other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Wonderful!  I put it all in  my mini prep and let it puree, still had little chunks of garlic which was a nice surprise in the salad.    But This is now the only Caesar dressing I will eat!  No more chemicle dressing for me!!  Thank you again.  I also made the croutons.  I didn't use any special bread just what I had on hand, as another reviewer stated he had sprayed them with cooking spray and baked them.  I have an olive oil sprayer, so I layed them out on a baking sheet in a single layer;  sprayed them with the olive oil and sprinkled them pretty agressively with garlic powder baked them on 350 for 8 minutes, stirred them and then back into the oven for another 7 minutes until the were golden.  My husband won't eat croutons says they are too hard.  these he ate and liked.  They are easy enough to make and I can store the extras for the next days lunch salads. I would urge anyone looking for a good (GREAT) Caesar dressing to try this one.  You will not be dissapointed!

My boyfriend really, really enjoyed this recipe! I thought it tasted wonderful too... but his vote counts more than mine =) I skipped the anchovies and meant to add anchovy paste but forgot... will add next time to give it a more "authentic" caesar flavor... but overall it was a wonderful recipe! Quick and easy!

Mmm, good!  I made this the first time with anchovy paste and subbed more than half of the mayo with buttermilk (I'm not a fan of mayo) and it was so good I was practically licking my blender.  The second time I made this with anchovies, four fillets and I thought it was a little too fishy, I had to add extra lemon juice and a dash of red wine vinegar.  UPDATE:  I've made this dressing so many times, I've lost count.  I've taken it to parties and served it to kids, okay, just three of the six ate it, but two of the three naysayers live on chicken fingers, mac n'cheese and ketchup, so, I don't think anything would have been approved by them.  Anyways, I leave out the parmesan because I always have too much dressing and it keeps well in the fridge if I leave the parmesan out and just add cheese to the salad after tossing.  Thank you for a perfect recipe!!!!

This is tasty, but the "thickness" problem really has a lot to do with the significant amount of mayonnaise in the recipe (it also makes it a lot "fattier").  You can cut the mayonnaise in half and reduce the thickness problem.  3/4 cup mayonnaise with 1/4 cup olive oil is a whole lot of fat.  I add balsamic vinegar to taste as well.  With those modifications you shouldn't have to add much water, if any, to thin it.

Wow!  This was the biggest hit at my holiday open house....I doubled the recipe and not one bite was left!  My guests were raving about it and begging for the recipe.  I used Pepperidge Farm white bread for the croutons.  This bread is very dense and makes a wonderful crouton.  I also substituted shredded parmesan cheese for grated when tossing the salad....(I used grated in the dressing.)  I am planning to make this again on Christmas day!!

The best!!! Teenage son had three helpings and was ticked off there wasn't any more.  I did add an extra clove of garlic, and a tablespoon of milk, as it was a little thick. Thank You.

Made this as directed, minus the extra salt, because anchovies give you enough.   Everyone in the family raved about it and used it as a dipping sauce the next night with vegetables.   The next time I make it (and there will be a next time!) I will thin it a little more with olive oil/lemon juice, because this was too clumpy as-is.

I was a little nervous about making this recipe, as although there were many great reviews, there were some that said it was too thick or too fishy or garlicky or mayonaisey...but I made it to go with our Christmas Dinner and it was just wonderful!!  Not too thick...a perfect creamy caesar.  I did only put in half the anchovies, and used pre-made croutons, but it still tasted perfect and everyone kept raving about it!!  Just a note...I doubled the recipe because I didn't think it was enough for the amount of lettuce in the recipe.  Give it a try..you won't be dissapointed.

I am a caesar salad snob and won't eat anything out of the bottle. This recipe is one of the best ones out there. I've had to give this recipe out several times. I'm not a big anchovy fan, so I actually use anchovy paste, and only a teaspoon or two of it. I think it's the right amount.

Wonderful base recipe. 

I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, and I didn't make the croutons because I have a gluten intolerance and I don't think they're necessary. I also haven't been frying up the additional garlic.

I've been eating Caesar salads for four days in a row using this recipe as my base. Thank you!

This is a phenomenal salad and dressing. I finally got to use our wooden salad bowl we got as a wedding gift! My Suggestions…use premium parmesan cheese that you grated yourself. You’d be surprised at what a difference this really makes. I also prefer to use homemade mayonnaise…it’s easy to make if you have a good food processor or blender and it really makes for a GREAT dressing. Be sure to wash your lettuce completely first and pat dry (or let dry completely) then tear the lettuce to the preferred size. Don’t cut using a steel knife…if you have a lettuce porcelain knife then you can use it but tearing the lettuce really gives the salad some character and the lettuce lasts longer when torn…its proven! Ha! Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly by the recipe. It seemed like it needed something else. So I ended up adding an entire (2 oz) can of anchovies, juice of 1 lemon, and upped the mustard and Worcestershire. I used 1 cup of mayo. With these adjustments, it tasted wonderful.  I then added extra virgin olive oil until it reached my preferred consistancy. Fabulous!  I think you just have to adjust it to your own taste.  This is a fantastic recipe.  If you have time, let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving.   I think if you cut back on the oil, it would be a wonderful aioli to use on sandwiches--grilled chicken with romaine on brioche--mmmmm!

Wonderful tasting ceasar salad! The Worcestershire sauce taste was a little too strong for me, so I would use 1/2 tsp instead of the full tsp. I also may cut down on the garlic a bit, unless you like it SUPER garlicy! But a very good recipe none the less! 

I did make my own croutons as well, which turned out perfectly! What I like to do though, is use sourdough bread instead of just regular bread. It adds a bit extra taste, and turns out wonderful! 

This salad was a huge hit at a recent pot luck dinner I went to!

Not that this recipe needs another rave review, but WOW - delicious!  I am always ordering Caesar salads in restaurants, but have never attempted to make my own dressing at home - until now.  What I like about making this myself is that I can control how "fishy" the dressing tastes, unlike when I'm at a restaurant (I've had some pretty bad salads because of that).  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't have anchovy fillets, but I did have paste - I just used a dab of it.  And thanks to the reviewer who suggested thinning it out with some half & half (I used whole milk)... it was PERFECTION!  I had no idea Caesar dressing was THIS easy... I'm anxious to try a Caesar chicken wrap now - I may never need to eat out again!!

I've always said "I don't do home made caesar salad dressing."  Now I do.  this is soo good!  The only thing I do differently is I don't use anchovies (can't stand the stuff), so I add a little bit more salt.  It's a family favourite and I now make it regularly for my grilled chicken caesar salad.  Yum!  Even better...I use low fat mayo...so it's almost guilt free.  :o)

Not your classic Caesar salad, but delicious nonetheless.  I didn't have anchovy, so I used kalamata olives.  The croutons are a delight!  This one's a keeper.  Just writing about it is making me hungry.

Real caesar is always the best, but this is a close second. If you can't stand the stuff from the grocery store, but don't want to coddle an egg (like me) this is your best bet. It does taste of mayo, but it doesn't over power the other flavors, so I think it works. Also, doing the croutons seemed like it would be easier than in the over, but its just not. Toss them in the garlic oil mixture then toast them in the over. You'll get more evenly cooked croutons that are perfectly crunchy and will last for days.

This was just amazing!!!! It was very thick and I added quite a bit of red wine vinegar to make it runny enough to pour out of the jar. The longer you chill it the thicker it gets. If you add some drops of red wine vinegar it becomes workable again. Do NOT put any salt!!! I am a salt freak (love it!!!) and the anchovy paste (in my case 1 to 2 teaspoons)made it salty enough!!!! I did put a LOT of pepper. This is wonderful. Everyone that tasted it just loved it. Thank you!

My husband did not think he liked Caesar Salad until I prepared this one.  He has already requested it again.  I did not think you could make an authentic Caesar without the coddled egg.  This is so easy and delicious. I decreased the garlic to 2 cloves, as one reviewer suggested. I used Hellmann's Light Mayonnaise to lower the fat content and grilled, sliced chicken breast plus more grated Parmesan to the finished salad.  Thanks so much for such a delicious recipe.

I'm like Goldilocks with Caesar Salad dressings. Most are too creamy, too lemony, too wrong. This one is Baby Bear, just right. UPDATE - I've been making this dressing for about 6 months now, and it continues to be be my favorite Caesar dressing.  I make it as written with the addition of 1 tablespoon water to help thin it. Otherwise it thickens too much after chilling. It still draws rave reviews. We like it so much that I always double the recipe. It lasts for about 3 weeks well chilled.

I was complimented on this at our dinner. I used the food processor to whip it up fast. I will say, BE SURE to let it sit for a while because its flavor improved much with sitting.

Very good recipe. I am looking for an old recipe I used to use, but can't remember all of it. I know it had egg in it, but this was close. The only thing I did different was added 3-4 more cloves of garlic.

I've been looking forever for a good casear dressing recipe and this is it! I made this for Chrismas day and will be making again. The only suggestion I have is it made a lot of dressing for 6 serving. We like our caesars a little on the drier side so for us it made almost 12 serving. (we dressed the salad to our liking and had about 1/2 of it left).

took it to my cooking club night and everyone went NUTS over this recipe!  Used Anchovy paste but next time I will use anchovie because I like more of the strong taste of the anchovies.  Still people were going crazy over it.  Will make it again.

Oh my goodness gracious.  This was so easy and delicious!  I will never buy bottled dressing again.  It is a little thick, and I'm not sure how you would thin it out, but we adapt by using smaller portions.  Definitely a keeper.

Not only is this incredibly easy when you toss everything into a mini food processer...it's got no raw egg and tastes AMAZING. I'm incredibly selective when it comes to Ceasar (only enjoy it when ordered at a specific italian restaurant in South Florida) and this dressing is almost identical. I followed the recipe exactly; with the exception of using FRESHLY shredded parmesan cheese over the top before mixing and serving. I didn't do the croutons right though and they came out very plain - not sure what went wrong. Will try them again and the dressing is an instant staple in my recipe book! This recipe made enough for me to nicely coat 2 chopped hearts of romaine with HALF of the dressing left over! Woohoo!

What a fabulous Caesar recipe!  I didn't have filets, so I used Anchovy paste (about 4 inches) and it was perfectly balanced.  I also probably put a tsp PLUS about another half tsp of dijon in the dressing. I also used ALOT of finely grated Parmesan Reggiano - as we are nuts for the flavor in the salad. We didn't even use all the salad dressing for one large head of romaine and it probably would have handled two heads with just the right amount of dressing.  Served with wild Alaska salmon and garlic bread.  It was a fantastic dinner and the Caesar was all the raves.  Brilliant recipe - probably the best caesar salad I've ever had anywhere ... and I've had my share!  We think it would be great topped with sauteed seafood (lobster, prawns, scallops) or blackened salmon... chicken too.  Will definitely keep this recipe and treasure forever!

This was fantastic!  I made some changes, though:  I added 6 grilled chicken tenders, 1/4 lb of chopped turkey bacon, to the dressing I added 1 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning and I cut the mayo down to 1/2 c and added about 1/8 c of milk.  I mixed the dressing in the blender to smooth out the consistency and chop up the anchovies further.  I used store-bought croutons.  I will definitely be making this again, it is restaurant quality.

Hi there,

I have not written a review on this site yet - but after making this dressing I had to.  

I followed some other readers suggestions and exactly doubled the recipe - but added 3 tbsp of red wine vinegar and an extra tbsp of lemon juice cause i like it tangy.

this is awesome dressing - sitting in my fridge right now and hopefully it won't get eaten by me before lunch tomorrow.

thanks for a great recipe.

Wow!  The dressing is very garlicky -- and this is coming from a garlic lover.  I used only 2 large cloves in the dressing, but the garlic flavor was still overpowering.  Aside from that and the thickness, it's a nice dressing.  Instead of frying my croutons, I tossed them in a little olive oil, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and parmesan, then baked until crunchy (if they start getting too brown, turn off oven and let the heat finish drying them out).  I also used multi-grain bread for the croutons.  Every healthy tweak helps!

I've lost count how many times I have given this recipe out.  It is a family favorite, and I make it for guest all summer long and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.  I assemble the lettuce and cheese ahead of time (hold the croutons until ready ready to serve) then grill chicken to top the salad making a grilled chicken Caesar salad.  I do make a few adjustments.  I find the dressing too thick when made as is, so I add a couple or more Tablespoons of olive oil as I am blending it up in the blender. I also do the croutons as written, but after they are browned I pour them out into a baking sheet, sprinkle with fresh parmasan cheese and Italian herbs, and pop in the oven for about 8 minutes. Other than that I don't change a thing.  This recipe is absolutely delicious and my family never tires of it and ask for it by name often.

This is the most amazing salad I have ever had! I added a little grilled chicken and did not use the homemade croutons, but it was still delicous! The dressing is what makes this salad special and it is very quick and easy to make. YUMM!
*Watch out if you refridgerate the dressing overnight, because it becomes VERY strong*

Since this was so highly rated, I expected alot.  It tastes good but you can't eat but a tiny bowl - the taste is too overpowering - too creamy, RICH and garlicky and I made it with lite mayo. If you like creamy, cheesy, rich  dishes then you will like this.  Otherwise, stick to more of a traditonal caesar recipe.  Tried it with regular mayo too, and it's way too rich.  I will probably only make it on occasion for a potluck.  It will not be regular for me.

This dressing is spot-on! Exactly what I was looking for! Didn't bother with the whole crouton thing, as I was looking for a quick dinner-but next time I'll fix the entire thing. In the meantime...looks like my lunches this week will be extra-savory!

I followed the instructions exactly, but I thought it had too much of a Mayo taste. So I upped the lemon quite a bit. That helped, but I wasn't blown away by it.

Great salad. Giving this 4 stars b/c, while it was good, it wasn't mind-blowing. I will definitely make it again, though. I also blended the ingredients in a blender. Worthwhile.

We ate this with Mama's Best Broiled Tomato Sandwiches from this site. A GREAT combo! Thanks, Karen!

Fabulous. I tried it with and w/o the fish... didn't really have a preference, both are d-lish. Used Miricle whip instead of mayo and nixed the cheese (I know - shock!) and I used soy sauce instead of worcestershire. Love it.

This was a good recipe although I didn't like the "mayonaise taste".  I only started with 1/4 cup of mayo and added olive oil instead and could still taste the mayo.  So, I added 2 more garlic cloves and a dash of tabasco and it was great!

The only part of this recipe I use is the dressing recipe and it IS the BOMB!  I am not a fan of anchovies so I omit the anchovies and it is just as good, or better than, any dressing in stores or restaurants.  I do make one change.  I am a bit lazy so I use garlic powder instead of cloves.  I am sure there is no difference.  I buy the Sargento 6 cheese Italian blend to put on top of the lettuce and some store-brand croutons.  I also add hard-boiled eggs.  I could eat this salad everyday and I do not think I would get tired of it.

This dressing is DELICIOUS!  I only use 1 clove of garlic b/c I'm not a huge garlic fan.  Also, I only use 2 or 3 anchovies so it's not quite as strong.  Because of this recipe, Chicken Caesar Salad has become a regular dinner around our house.  Also, I always use light Mayo and it's just great.

This is the best creamy caesar salad recipe!  I use anchovy paste in place of the anchovies and reduce the garlic to 1 clove in the dressing.  I also use already prepared croutons when in a hurry and it is still delicious.

I loved this recipe. It tastes like the Caesar dressing from Carrabba's. I liked the fact that it was a thick, creamy dressing. I will be making this again, but I think I will try the anchovy paste next time.

This was absolutely delicious!  I added sliced seasoned grilled chicken to it and made a nice meal out of it.  The only thing that I would change in this recipe is to only use 2 garlic cloves instead of 3 in the dressing.  I love garlic, but found it a little too strong.  Definitely a keeper!

Living in Germany, and ceaser salad is unheard of here. I made this for my neighbours and they loved it, tasted like authentic ceaser salad I got back home in Canada. I will keep this recipe and use it in Germany always.

THIS WAS THE BEST CASEAR SALAD I HAVE EVER MADE...I ADDED A LITTLE MORE GARLIC, AND WAS ABLE TO RESERVE A LITTLE DRESSING.  THE CROUTONS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  YOU WON'T RESIST POPPING A FEW!

Wonderful dressing.  A++  I made this for a dinner party I had recently.  I knew there would be a few pregnant women attending and they might have had concerns with raw egg in the dressing, so I used this recipe because it called for mayonnaise.  It was wonderful and so easy to make.  I'm so glad I made extra because I ate it for 2 days after and it was still good.  I added just a smidge less anchovy because I didn't want to overpower some of the queasy guests, but next time I'll add at least what the recipe calls for.  Overall, excellent recipe for company or anytime!

Fantastic recipe! Everyone raved about it!  As a side note, though, and this may be a no-brainer to most, but it wasn't for me, and the story gets me laughed at by friends now.  Maybe the tip will help you, before you start!  I assumed the anchovies would easily flake apart when I put them with the other dressing ingredients, but no such luck.  I ended up having to pick them out - messy with all the mayonnaise gooped around them -- and tried to cut them up, but that didn't work either.  I ended up using a blender with all dressing ingredients, and that worked like a champ.  Next time, I will either use anchovy paste, or start out with the blender in the first place!  =)

Oh wow...is this ever good! I made the dressing as instructed except I used Hellmans's low-fat mayo and about a TBS of olive oil to thin it a bit. I won't change a thing when I make it again. DH raved about it and he basically uses nothing but Italian dressing on all salads. I didn't make the croutons because I have a good fat-free brand and that helped offset the fat in the dressing. A local restaurant serves a Caesar salad topped with grilled chicken and served on a layer of ziti which has been lightly tossed with dressing. This is the perfect dressing to duplicate it at home. Follow-up note: Today I made the Chicken Caesar Pasta salad and it was a good as the restaurant's. Thanks for a winning recipe.

This is absolutely the best recipe for Caesar salad dressing I have ever tasted! I fooled a chef - her exact words were, "Mmmmmm, now THAT'S real Caesar dressing!" I used 2 tsp. anchovy paste instead of fillets, and purchased top shelf yet premade croutons.
Thanks so much for the recipe, Karen!

I made this last night and it was great!  I used the anchovy paste, as others suggested, and also used pre-minced garlic from a jar, and mixed it all together in the blender.  The only changes I would make- add more garlic and lemon juice. Maybe a tad bit more dijon. It had more of a mayo taste to it than I wanted.  I think the combo of garlic and lemon is the key. Great recipe!

Made this for dinner last night and it was soo good. My mouth was watering even after I got done eating it. I wasnt for sure what else to make to go along with this, so I decided to throw some chicken breasts on the grill. When they were done, I sliced them up into bite size pieces and added it to the salad...delicious. This is a forever keeper!!!!!!! THANKS KAREN!!!

Finally, a Caesar salad made from scratch!  This was absolutely delicious.  For all those who skipped the anchovies...why??  Anchovies add flavour but it doesn't make the dressing taste fishy.  Just watch the size of the garlic cloves you use, because mine were quite large, and the taste was very strong.  You don't need to thin the dressing, just keep tossing until the lettuce is totally coated.  Next time I would skip the croutons though.  It was a little time consuming, and they were no better than store bought.

Awesome dressing! I will never buy pre-made Caesar dressing again. Have also quit ordering Caesar salads out, since the dressing doesn't even compare to the full flavor of this at home. I increased the amount of garlic, dijon and lemon juice to give it more tang. Also used anchovy paste, as it is less messy than real anchovies. Dressing should be thick to coat all the greens and not leave a puddle in the bottom of the bowl. My husband and I love it. Thanks.

Best Caesar Salad Recipe. Left out anchovies and added a par boiled egg.  Don't skip making the croutons, it's the best part.

this is the best caesar salad ever!!! making it in a food processor quickens up the pace.  i also enjoy making it with an extra clove of garlic, instead of the anchovies, like TMART68376 suggested.  a member of my family absolutally hates salads, but requests this salad to be made often.

This dressing is the best!  If you have ever been to a restaurant that prepares Caesar dressing table side, this will bring that experience to your kitchen.  We do not like anchovies so we just leave them out.  Those who say there is too much garlic may not be reading the recipe correctly.  Half of the garlic is for the dressing, half for the oil to make the croutons.

Tried this with a wonderful recipe 'Jo Mama's Spaghetti' and I did not have any anchovies but I did have anchovy paste.  The dressing was a huge hit with my guests and me-all wanted the recipe.  Most bottled Caesar dressing is a bit too 'sharp' tasting for me.  This was perfect!  I used Parmesan-Romano as it's what I had.  I did add some half'n'half as it was a bit thick. But as a 'from scratch' recipe, A+  Thanks, Karen, for this great recipe!

excellent find!
Tastes great. followed to a tee, although I think I could have omitted the anchovies and it would still be delicious. instead of making the croutons in the recipe, here's my version. They are awesome. use hot dog or hamburger buns!! I cube, put into a ziplock bag, drizzle generously with olive oil, and garlic salt. (taste for proper amount) Then pour onto a baking sheet in a single layer, and bake at 300 degrees, stirring occasionally till crisp and browned. ***the key is the buns, just something about the texture of the bread that gives a crunchy crouton. I just freeze the buns and take out what i want, sometime cutting while still frozen. it works!!

I made this recipe as is and it tasted great! Take the time to make the homemade croutons, its worth it. I used to make a dressing with a coddled egg, and have to deal with it being a little too watery. This recipe uses mayo, making it a quicker recipe.

This is a family favorite.  This is also requested by family and friends for parties.  It's easy and delicious!  Although it might seem fattening, you really don't need much dressing, just toss it very well.  A little goes a long way.  I don't use as much garlic as the recipe calls for.

Amazing caesar salad and dressing!  I made it as written the first time, anchovies and all.  Wonderful!  Dressing is creamy, but not too thick or unspreadable as others have said.  I used slightly less than 3/4 cup mayo simply because I was at the bottom of my jar.  I can't imagine a couple more spoonfuls making a difference in the consistency though!  I'm making it again now and I'm using 2 cloves of garlic in the dressing instead of the 3 specified.  We liked the taste with 3, but wanted to see if we preferred the dressing with 2 instead.  I think it'll just make it not so strong and tasting garlic for the rest of the night!

I made it exactly as written and put it in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the flavors develop. Fortunately, I tasted it before dressing the salad. It tasted mostly like mayonnaise, so I added more lemon juice and more anchovies. That helped enough to use it, but I will not make it again.

Omitted mayo and used equal amount of plain Greek yogurt. No added salt and lots of pepper. Prepared in my food processor. Very very very easy and yummy!

This is by far the best homemade Caesar salad ever. I followed the instructions to a T except I left out the anchovies because of allergies.  I served this at a family party and everyone asked for the recipe.  They all LOVED it. I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely be making it again.

Absolutely fabulous, in every way. The dressing is outstanding, and the croutons are great as well. I prepared the dressing in a mini food processor (I'm not sure a full-size food processor would work well, due to the small volume of dressing this makes). Definitely use the anchovies, even if you're not sure about them. They're essential to the authentic flavor, and they truly disappear into the dressing, especially using the food processor. Also, they're actually inexpensive (under $2 or $3, usually, depending on the brand). 

This recipe is definitely making it into my regular rotation. I added a warm, grilled cajun chicken breast (from this site), and it was pure heaven.

Fabulous salad ... served on Christmas and it got rave reviews.  My husband said it was the best Caesar dressing he ever had. I followed the recipe exactly and used a couple tricks that I learned from my favorite cookbook. First, when making croutons, its best to cook them slowly so that the butter/oil gets absorbed all the way through.  I cooked them on low for almost 20 minutes, stirring frequently. They were crispy and flavorful. Second, when dressing the lettuce, pour the dressing around the top of the bowl itself.  (Don't pour it directly on the lettuce.) Then, toss the salad or mix with utensils.  The dressing spreads so evenly and I served the extra in a small bowl in case someone wanted more. My last comment is to go easy on the anchovy. When I opened the container, I wasn't sure if the "pair of wings" was one or two filets. The first time, I used too much and it tasted awful. I made another batch with five single "wings" and it was perfect.

I have made this numerous times for lunch and dinner.  It is the best.  I also add chicken to make it a complete dinner with crusty rolls.  The only time it failed was when I forgot the garlic in the dressing.....OOPS.  Definitely use the anchovies....

My family loves this salad.  I also use the anchovy paste.  It is easy and works very well.   For the croutons, I cube the bread, toss with olive oil and salt and bake in oven at 350 until crispy.

Don't mess with a good thing!!  Made for a dinner party last night. My friend who is a self proclaimed caesar salad snob said this was best she'd ever had and better than any italian bistro.  I followed the ingredients exactly as stated.  I pureed dressing in food processor to avoid chunks of garlic or anchovies overpowering a bite.  I was told that I WILL be bringing this to any future dinners I am invited to. It is rich, it is garlic-y, it is creamy, it is thick. It is AMAZING!!!!  Time to stock up on anchovies in the pantry!!!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. It was good, but I much prefer traditional Caesar salad. That said, this is good for what it is. I made this by mixing all the ingredients together in a bowl with a spoon. The problem is that you get chunks of anchovy that can make some bites of your salad taste overly fishy. Blending or processing the dressing solves this issue, as I did with the leftover dressing. I think the anchovies are definitely necessary, but 5 fillets is probably too much for some people. Adjust accordingly!

I followed this recipe exactly, but neither I nor my Caesar salad-loving family members liked this. The dressing is very thick, too garlicky, and there is WAY too much of it. Even when I added a second large head of Romaine, the salad was overwhelmed.

This is a great alternative to the classic coddled egg version.  It has all of the taste, but you could keep it in the fridge and use it over a few days making it a great option for smaller households.  I actually didn't make the croutons, but used store bought to save time and effort, and it was still great.

Very good recipe.  Makes way more dressing than for 1 head of lettuce.  More like 3.  Added lots of lemon to make it really zesty.

I am giving the dressing only 5 stars, as I created my own Caesar salad. I made this tonight with grilled chicken  and WOW! was it good! The only thing different I did was use anchovy paste instead of fillets and added some 1% milk after blending in my Kitchenaid, as the dressing was a little thick. I will be making this again, as I detest bottled salad dressing!

This is definately comparable to what you can get in a restaurant. Don't be afraid to try the anchovy paste. I was hesitant to add it in because I'm not a fan of them, but I didn't want to mess with a new recipe so I bought the paste. I only used half of what was called for in the recipe and it was delicious!

I made this exactly as directed.My family prefers a ceasar with fresh beaten eggs and a little more lemony flavour. This recipe is very rich more so than the kind made from scratch (somewhat like the Renee's brand)and the quantity of ''sauce'' is more than you'll need for 1 head of romaine, you could probably generously cover 2 medium heads. We also found that it was a little over the top in the garlic department , BUT I used fresh-from-the-garden garlic that is flavourful and juicy, so it could be that. I won't make this again as it is written, just too rich and too garlicky.

I'm only rating the dressing, I did not make the croutons.  But the dressing was UNBELIEVABLE!  Tasted like something from a fine restaurant.  I didn't do anything different except omit the anchovy fillets.  It was delicious.  I bought a bag of caesar croutons.  I also added some fresh shredded parm for the perfect look.  SOOOOO GOOD, people!  You must make it.

This dressing is outstanding! We love it. I've made it a few times now. I had to make it a bit healthier though, so I split the mayonnaise portion 50/50 with light mayo and plain greek yogurt. I swear you can't tell the difference! So yummy!

I made this without the anchovies and used pre-packaged croutons...shame on me.  I'm sure it's excellent as is; I had dinner guests coming over who would not have liked the anchovies, but I would like to try that sometime.  I do wish it was a tad less mayonnaisey.

Wow.  I was aprehensive about a mayo based dressing, then realized mayo was an emulsion of egg and oil, the 'missing' ingredients in this recipe.  This tastes like the high end restaurants where they make the salad tableside.  Yeah, that good!.  I threw all of the ingredients into a small food processor without mincing and it all came together in a few minutes.  I also liked that I didn't have to use a raw egg.  I did not make the croutons so I can't comment on those, but this is my new 'go-to' caesar salad dressing. Thank you.

We really enjoyed this, including me and I don't like anchovies in the least...but I couldn't tell they were in there by taste alone...they added depth without fishy-ness. The croutons weren't memorable, my fault I am sure, but they were my first and I was proud of them anyway.

This is awesome!!  Made exactly how it said too and everyone who tried it loved it and wanted the recipe.  The only shortcut I made was that I bought croutons for the salad rather than using the day old bread.  Will make many more times

Loved it, but did alter a bit.  Omit the anchovies, used less mayo and more olive oil to thin it out.  But the flavor was great!  Have made it several times.

I will never use another Caesar Salad recipe ever. This was SOO good. I;ve been using this for months! My family loves it. I didn't use the anchovies, and i just used store bought croutons, still delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

This is my new caesar recipe. I did tweak it up the second time. Less anchovy and more garlic and lemon juice. Mahalo for the recipe.

Caesar dressing at its best! Dressing was too thick though...(thus the 4 stars) I added 1/2 cup of milk to thin out and it was still very strong and flavorful, just like a Caesar dressing should be! I used homemade "Crostini" for a crisper crouton, instead of the stale bread in the garlic oil. Will not be buying "bottled" Caesar dressing after making this great recipe!

This is a very good caesar salad recipe. I liked that I didn't have to use raw eggs. I add a little more lemon juice than it calls for. I don't bother making the homemade croutons. The store bought work just as well.

Fantastic!!  This is the tastiest caesar dressing I have ever had.  I did add a little more lemon juice, and the recommended red wine vinegar, but just a little.  Really very impressed, and so easy to make.  Many thanks!

This salad is excellent! I like the flavor of anchovy, but I don't want to bite into a piece of it. So what I do is make the dressing, but instead of mincing them I mix them in whole, and let the dressing sit in the fridge for a few hours. Before I mix the dressing in I just remove the fish and the dressing has the taste of anchovy, but no little pieces that turn some people off.

Way too mayonaisey.  Terribly thick.  It tasted nothing like a traditional caesar salad recipe.

I thought this was very good.  I didn't add the anchovies because I didn't have any on hand.  Next time I'm going to add them.  This recipe was very much like the ones served in a restaurant.  I followed the recipe to a T (except anchovies) and the dressing was thick.  However, once you place it on the lettuce it turns out fine.  I mixed  my dressing ahead of time for the flavors to marinate.  I recommend that you wait to top the salad with the dressing because your lettuce will wilt quickly.  I will be making this again.

This was much more simple to make than I initially thought.  It tasted great.  I noticed that many people didn't add the anchovies because they don't like them, which neither do I, but anchovies are the staple in the dressing.  I don't think it would be nearly as tasty if the anchovies were not in.  Croutons were excellent.  I didn't make them very crunchy, just lightly toasted, which was great and much easier to chew if you've got a crusty bread.

Absolutely delicious dressing.  I omitted making the croutons, to make this low carb.  Everyone loved it and compared it to Caesar salads we've had at restaurants.  The anchovies make this dressing...thank you so much for sharing!

As good as any restaurant caesar.  But I think it made enough dressing for almost 2 heads of romaine lettuce.  I will put more lettuce next time.

I've been searching for such a long time for the perfect mayo-based creamy Caesar Salad dressing and my search has ended! This review is based on changes/tweakings due to what I had on hand: I basically doubled the recipe, made it in the food processor, used 5 small cloves of garlic, used 1 Tbls. anchovy paste, and a combo of 1 Tbls. each of lemon juice (it's all that was on hand) and 1 Tbls. white wine vinegar (to sub for the other Tbls. of lemon juice that was needed), and added no additional salt as we found the salt in the mayo and anchovies to provide more than enough. This is perfect for our palates! Thanks so much and to all the reviewers for their suggestions on subs for the various ingredients!

This is a great and easy Caesar Salad recipe.  I used this recipe for a lunch gathering party with my friends in January and everybody loved it and asked for this delicious recipe.  By taking other members’ advice, I cut down half of garlic and anchovy fillets (I only used 2), then I let the food processor to do the rest of work for me.  I saved 4 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese to toss with the salad with dressing.  I skipped to make the home made crouton and just get one package from the store to go with this dish.    Hope you will find this information useful and thanks to Karen for sharing this delicious recipe.

I made this without the anchovies and it was still very good.  Definitely make the dressing at least an hour ahead of time for the flavors to blend.  The croutons were yummy, too!

Scrump-di-le-icious!  The dressing is wonderful!  I too have had a hard time finding a dressing in the grocery store that tastes as good as restaurant caesar.  Not anymore! I used the anchovy paste like other reviewers.  I made it a day ahead per suggestions to let the flavors marinate together.  Thanks for submitting this recipe! Woo hoo! I am in Caesar heaven!

This was SO good.  Like others we used anchovy paste instead of chopping anchovies.  It wasn't fishy at all.  We weren't sure of the amount so the first time I added about 2 inches squeezed out of the tube and it wasn't enough.  The next time we added about 5 inches and it was too much - not too fishy, just too salty.  Three inches seems just about right.  Thanks to whoever shared this. (I wish they listed that info on the rating screen.)

MAGNIFICO! But, careful when using store bought croutons.  Use only 3 garlic cloves in the dressing.  The other 3 of the 6 listed are for croutons.  This recipes is SO quick & easy and SO delicious!  It's the best salad dressing I've ever had.  Also good with anchovie paste (1-2 Tablespoons).  Can use a little vinegar instead of lemon to get same taste.  Serve with chicken breast or archovies on the top.  I used Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls, crusty Italian.  Fantastic!  Fabulous!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I whipped this up for a quick lunch one day after church. It was a fast and delish lunch the dressing and croutons were great. I do think that next time I will leave out the anchovies because the next day the left over dressing was really fishy.

I live in Belgium and we can't buy bottled caesar dressing anywhere so I was glad to find this recipe. Makes a very good salad but I give it only 4 stars because this was VERY garlicky. Might not please everyone and leaves you with a very bad breath... Used anchovy paste and more lemon juice since I found the dressing a bit too thick.

This salad is fantastic.  Even our picky eaters, who were grossed out at the sight of the anchovies going into the dressing, liked the finished product.  Using mayonnaise, even reduced or non fat, is a wonderful way to avoid using raw eggs.  Great job!

I really thought there was no way to enjoy the taste of authentic caesar dressing without having to make the real thing.  I was very wrong - this really does taste great and is so much less work.  I used anchovy paste, and used half french bread and half whole wheat french bread for the croutons - it really was great.  I made it for Christmas Eve dinner for 20 people and everyone commented on it.  Highly recommended!

I've been making this for years, i got it from my dad. I absolutely love it except we make it with 2 heads of romain and 1lb of cooked bacon bitted into bite sized pieces, lots of fresh parmesan on the lettuce & pepper.. a coddle egg (yolk) only. We use dry mustard not dijon and we don't use anchovy anything!!!  I mix it by hand so it dopesn't turn into paste. I get raved reviews on this salad and no one ever wants that creamy sauce again!

I've been using this site for months ... It was only when I tried this recipe did I join the community so I could rave! This is absolutely the BEST caesar salad dressing you could hope to make. I also substituted anchovy paste as per previous reviews and have been pestered for the recipe by friends and family ever since! Thank-you Karen Weir for sharing!

The dressing was absolutely excellent! Probably the best caesar I have ever had. I made these into caesar salad boats for a party. For my croutons I cut up french bread drizzled it with olive oil, minced garlic, and cut up green onions. Excellent!

This is astoundingly good!! I'm one of those people who loves to cook and is constantly looking for "something even better". But I think on Caesar, I'm going to stick to this one. I hate mayonnaise, and wouldn't have made this had it not been for the reviews. The only changes I made were to use anchovy paste (about 1-2 tsp) and I added a little extra lemon and parmesan. After serving this at a recent dinner party, every guest asked for the recipe. It's amazing... thanks!!

I wish i could give this recipe more then 5 stars. This is the best caesar salad recipe I have ever found. Dont let the mayo scare you off, or the anchovies for that matter. My whole family loves this.

I already had a Caesar dressing recipe that I was very satisfied with, but I figured I would try something new.  Well, this recipe blew my old one away!  This was fantastic!!!  I will never need another Caesar recipe.

The best Caesar Dressing I've ever had and easy too.  It's so good we now have Caesar Salad 3-4 times a week. I make in a mayo jar and quadruple the recipe.  I also leave out the parm as I find it too thick.  I just grate the parm onto the greens. I have given out this recipe to others as well.  Thank you Karen.............

Fantastic! Even those who "WON'T EAT A CAESAR SALAD WITH ANCHOVIES ON IT" loved it, wish I had the recording of the face when I said the little bits are pieces of Anchovy!

I found the dressing to be really thick. I added olive oil but it just was too heavy and rich for my taste.I would scale back on the mayo. quite a bit.

Not as good as I had expected - too much of a mayonnaise taste, I think, and I really like mayo. Be careful with the croutons - if you use fresh bread, the olive oil will get soaked up in an instant.
Yes, the dressing is thick, but if you dress the greens before plating, as you're supposed to, you'll be fine, expecially with te dressing mixing in with the moisture on the leaves.

This was better than any bottled caesar dressing & most restaurant's, too. My caesar salad loving family flipped over this recipe. I added some crumbled bacon to the final product. If you really like caesar salad, this is the one for you!

Wonderful caesar salad.  I left out the anchovys and didnt make the croutons but followed the rest of the recipe and it was awesome.  Has a great kick with the garlic (I added a little more than called for, I'm a garlic freak).

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I did not add anchovies but took other reviewers advice and added an extra clove of garlic. I dont think I will do that next time because it had a tad too much garlic flavor. The dressing is on the thick side, I am not sure what I will use try to thin it. Some of the others said they added olive oil but I am afraid that will make it greasy. I may try some milk or just water to thin it out.

I made this salad for a small dinner party.  It was a hit.  I used anchovey paste and used some shredded parmesean cheese in the dressing. It was great and I have already made it a second time!  My 14 year old didn't care for it, but then she is not crazy about dressings.  Thanks for the recipe!

a creamy caesar dressing...absolutely fantastic.
for the mayo, i substituted half fat-free mayo and half fat-free sour cream.  i used about 2-3" of anchovy paste instead of fillets. thanx - this is wonderful!

I have finally found the PERFECT Caesar dressing.  Thanks you Karen!  I don't usually have anchovies around but always have anchovy paste.  Magnificent dressing and makes the perfect salad.  Homemade croutons are a must too.

This was a great salad, and I love the easy and delicious caesar dressing! So easy and so delicious! I did make two small changes. I baked the croutons instead, and used a combination of olive oil and butter to coat them with the garlic. I also added some crumbled bacon. My Husband loved it, but I would recommend cutting down the anchovies if you plan on preparing the dressing ahead or taking leftovers for lunch, the fish taste really permeates after a few hours! All and all a great salad! Great for company and for potlucks!

I made this dressing and while I reduced the amount of mayo by about a 1/4, and used half and half to thin it just a bit...we all loved it.  I used the anchovies and my hand blender to mix.  My daughter who is a Caesar dressing nut, loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe, that I'll be sure to make again.

This is so delicious and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Caesar salad. I used the exact measurements and made it a mini food processor. Next time I would make the croutons in the oven vs frying fan to get them crispier. We had it with French onion soup and a glass of red Italian wine.

Kids in the kitchen: My 10 yo son choose this recipe. He followed the dressing recipe to a tee, anchovies & all.   He cleaned & chopped 3 romaine lettuce hearts & tossed in freshly grated parm cheese. Family LOVED LOVED LOVED the salad! He wants to make this at least 1x/week. Thank you for posting!

This is a great recipe for Caesar Dressing. Best if made a few hours ahead to let the ingredients come together. I have to admit that I haven't made the croutons, just the dressing. I put 4 cloves minced garlic into the dressing, along with the entire amount of shredded parmesan. Everything else the same, with the small adjustment of using fresh-cracked black pepper instead of ground. Then dress and toss as directed. Very delicious!

I can't imagine a better Caesar dressing than this. It was perfect without any adjustments, but I ended up adding just a tad bit of buttermilk to thin it ever so slightly. Marvelous! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I just had to review this dressing.. I am picky about my Caesar dressing at restaurants so decided to try this one! Hands down it is one of the best dressings I have eaten. The ingredients blend well in my vitamix and I double the recipe and use it to dip breads and chicken in, it's even really good on baked potatoes.. I use the real anchovies not the paste! It is so amazing...I also use just a little bit of cream so it blends well and so creamy!

Followed the recipe exactly except used anchovy paste instead of anchovies. A previous reviewer challenged me to this because I have always thought I hated anchovies. No fishy taste whatsoever. I added chicken for a more hearty meal. Great recipe!

I made this for dinner last night, and it was great! I used real anchovy fillets. I also added grilled chicken to my husband's salad, and grilled shrimp to mine. I will definitely make this again, especially on a night where I am limited on time after work.

My opinion:  This recipe should be viewed with Handel’s ‘Hallelujah Chorus’ playing in the background.  
I made this dressing for the first time several months ago. Since that first bite, it’s made it to our dinner table 2 to 3 times per week.  Sometimes it’s a side dish, other times it is our entree with shrimp or chicken added.  I’ve served it to friends, family and get rave reviews from all.  The other day, my 10-year old grandson even asked me to make it for our Thanksgiving dinner.  
I love Caesar salad and in the past I’ve made different recipes all done in the traditional way – oil, lemon, egg, anchovies, Dijon, etc., all whisked into a nicely blended dressing.  They were good, but none brought back that 1970 ‘aha moment’ when I first tasted Caesar salad prepared tableside at a local steak house.  This one did just that!  (Had someone told me I could recreate that rich, robust taste with bottled mayonnaise, I would have thought they were crazy.)
Note:  No salt is needed.  The Parmesan and anchovies take care of the salt.  
Note:  So that you can make this salad when you get the urge (which might be often), you may want to start stocking those little cans of anchovies in your pantry (I have).

This salad was fantastic and so easy!!!  I threw the dressing ingredients into my food processor and it turned out so creamy. I will never have to buy caesar dressing again.

I was missing one ingredient and had to substitute another... and it was still awesome!  I can't wait to try this with all ingredients on hand.

Fantastic!  Simple!  Rave Reviews!  This was so easy!  No comparison to any bottled dressing and definitely worth the extra time it takes, which is minimal!  Friends loved it!  I could have served it as the main course. So
Many requests for more!  I will keep the dressing in the fridge for all occasions.   This is my new fave!!

Made as written except for using store-bought croutons. The Caesar dressing is very good. Will be adding chicken or shrimp at some future time.

consider using the blender for the dressing and baking the croutons instead of frying.

I love this dressing! I followed the recipe to the letter, using the minced anchovies. It's pretty thick but once it's on the lettuce, you wouldn't even know. Better than most restaurants.

I took this recipe when I first found it. I do not like to rate until I make it. Well I did make it and have made it so often it feels like a friend, no a very good friend. The first 2 weeks I shared  it with my granddaughter and had it for lunch every day. I have never found anything better. Not even in restaurants and I have tried many of those as well. Wow, thank you. We used to go out just for salad,  but now we remain at home and enjoy. Other recipes were flat and I stopped using them .

Let me tell you how good this recipe is.  My 11-year-old, who will only eat ranch dressing, asked that we rotate this in every other day.  Now, that's saying something!  Yes, it was a big hit at our table last night - loved by all.  I didn't especially like waking up this morning as if I had been sucking on a clove of garlic all night, so I might try to halve the garlic next go around.  Of course, it's the garlic that makes it so good, so I may have to rethink that!  One item I didn't have on hand was anchovies, so I left that out.  I'm sure they add some depth, but really, it's great without them too!  I whirled all the ingredients in my Magic Bullet and then added a tiny bit of skim milk to thin it just a little. As another reviewer suggested, I put the lettuce in the bowl and then poured the dressing around the rim of the bowl.  It tossed nicely, without clumping.  A keeper, for my family!

Loved this dressing! DSS even commented he really enjoyed it! Followed this exactly with the exception of thinning it a tad but the flavor is wonderful and it is easy to make! I used an immersion blender with great results! Thank you! This will be made again!!

We loved this dressing.  Since several of us were watching carbs, we didn't make the croutons.  We added a few more anchovy fillets and used an immersion blender to mix it all together well.  We did add a bit more lemon juice as well.

4 stars only because i was disappointed in the flavor of the dressing, probably because of the dijon mustard.  if you search other ceasar dressing recipes, you normally wouldn't find dijon, maybe ground mustard or no mustard at all. i felt the dijon ruined the flavor. next time i would make it without.  also, i would bake my croutons, rather than try to pan fry them. (honestly i would rather use my favorite rothbury farms cheese and garlic croutons from the store!)

Really, really good! Love the croutons and the dressing! I added red bell pepper for some color and it was just great. (I was really afraid of the anchovy fillets, and I only used 3 because of that, but I really couldn't taste anything fishy in the end)

Other than needing to thin it a bit, this is perfect.  I used anchovy paste because I don't like anchovy bits. It is too thick 4 me, so after tasting, I chose to thin with a bit more kick...more lemon,  a little vinegar and buttermilk.  I will thin it this way again...oil would work fine too unless you like to spoon it rather than pour it.

Totally love this recipe, although like many did not have (or use) any anchovies. Also did not have any Dijon mustard, just regular mustard. Still tasted great!  With the croutons, I ended up actually having to bake to get even browning. Baked at about 375 degrees.

This is a fantastic recipe! I needed a solid caesar dressing that could be pre-made and transported without spoiling. So one without eggs....but that would still rival a classic dressing flavour. This one definitely rose to the challenge! I didn't change a thing except adding some extra parm as well as some asiago at the end. Had to make enough to serve 40 people so I doubled the recipe and made it in 3 batches. It was exactly the right amount and all 40 people raved about it. Great job!! I will definitely be making this one again and again!

Tastes just like the homemade ceasar dressing at an expensive restaurant down the street from us. I also added oil to the dressing to thin it out a bit and cooked the bread cubes in butter instead of oil.

I have to admit I used this recipe solely for the sauce!  I didn't make my own croutons.  The sauce is to die for!
I didn't use the anchovies but made the sauce as written and tasted it pretty good.  I loved the garlic flavour but it needed a little tang.  I added some red wine vinegar, thinned it out just slightly with some milk and let it sit for a couple hours.  Amazing!
I love more of a garlic caesar salad and this fits the bill beautifully!  I will be making my caesar dressing from now on!
BTW, fresh parm is the only way to go.  That processed stuff just doesn't do it!  Buy a brick, keep it in the freezer in a ziplock bag and it'll last for months.  Just pull it out and grate it when you need it.

This is excellent and I got a ton of compliments when I served it to company.  Personal preference... I will never add anchovies again.  Yuck.  But the dressing is so yummy otherwise and I plan on having a constant supply in my fridge so I can to add it to wraps, salads, sandwiches, etc.  So much tastier than store bought.  And the homemade croutons RULE.  I did toss my croutons on a 11x15 pan and toasted in a 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes after removing them from my skillet.

easy to make (I only made the dressing).  However I will cut back on the garlic next time as I found it pretty strong.

Yum Yum Yum I have never been able to achieve a restaurant quality Caesar salad until now.  It's gonna be a regular staple in my menu rotation.

Great recipe! This was my first attempt at making caesar salad dressing from scratch and this recipe did not disappoint. I read several dozen reviews before preparing it. I used store bought croutons and halved both the garlic cloves and anchovies (yes I did use them, my husband said they HAD to go in this dressing if I wanted it to be authentic!). I also processed the dressing in my blender. I chilled it for 6 hours before tossing the romaine with it. We took this salad to a family dinner and received many compliments. Thanks for a very good recipe.

Perfect flavor.  I like a more fishy than garlicy dressing and this is it.  I used the anchovy fillets instead of the paste.  I also put it in the blender on the food processor and it got the garlic and anchovy pieces even finer.  I used regular mayonnaise since it was NYE (live a little!), but plan on making a lighter version with some low fat mayo.

I blend all the dressing ingredients as suggested by another reviewer and half the anchovies.  Otherwise I keep everything the same and all my guests always rave about this and ask for the recipe.  It truly is fantastic and I would give it 10 stars if it were possible.  It is fool proof and a sure crowd pleaser.

I have made this twice now - both times following the directions but w/o using anchovies.  The result is great.  There are a lot of calories and fat in the dressing so it isn't something that we will make frequently.  But this recipe works and tastes great and we will be making this again.

This was fanstastic.  I added some grilled chicken and called it a meal.  My husband RAVED about this.  I really like caesar salad but hate the bottled dressing, so we only have it when we go out.  Not anymore! The only thing I did differently was made the dressing in the morning to allow it to meld and then dressed my salad as needed. I think this is enough dressing for about 3 heads of romaine.  Next time I am going to try the low fat mayo and add spinach to my salad in order to make it a little healthier.  Because I can see us eating this salad weekly!

This is delicious! I've always assumed that Caesar salad uses regular ol' ranch dressing. But this was raved by my family as a very good salad. (I did use store bought croutons because it just seems more convenient.) Try it! You'll love it too!

I'm rating the dressing and it was so good.  I love that I control what is in it and that it makes just the right amount for about 6-8 dinner salads so just perfect for my hubby and me.  Thank you for the great recipe Karen, I'll use it often.

I only made the dressing and it was WONDERFUL!  I added 2 extra anchovy fillets for a total of 7 in the dressing, added NO salt and a little freshly ground black pepper.  This dressing is easy to make and so much better than the bottled dressing.  I will use this from now on.  You can't go wrong!

WONDERFUL! Tweaking included twice the fresh lemon juice and changing the 3/4 c mayo to a halfed homemade mayo and nonfat greek yogurt, thereby cutting more fat calories.  We added a little more anchovie paste too.  WONDERFUL and fresh.  Oh, and I made my croutons by toasting some sourdough bread with a light brushing of butter and fresh garlic instead of doing the croutons they way they were described in the recipe.  Sooooo much better than store-bought Caesar dressing (and much healthier!)

This would have been 5 stars except for 2 minor alterations in my book.  I think there is too much garlic, I will use about half next time. (and we love garlic)  And it's too thick.  I added a little milk to thin it out.  Otherwise it's delish.

I am giving this 2 stars b/c my husband said it was okay, not great.  I hated it - and I fixed it exactly as stated.  I have fixed dressings with a mayo base and liked them just fine.  However, in this recipe all I could taste was mayo and anchovies.  The flavors seemed muddy to me.  After I tried it, I did go back and try to brighten the flavor of the leftover dressing with more lemon, then even added some red wine vinegar.  Still gross.  I just had a chicken breast for dinner that night.

Made this dressing tonight.  even bought anchovies.  Way too much garlic, Recommend only 3 cloves ( I didn't cook them) and it would have been much better.  I saved the leftover as I'll use it tomorrow with bread.

I have been looking for a good Caesar dressing for a very long time and decided to try this recipe.  I don't like anchovies so I left them out, added an extra garlic clove, instead of 3/4 mayo I did 1/2 mayo and 1/4 fat free yogurt and an extra squeeze of lemon juice.  It is truly the best caesar I have ever had!  I don't miss the anchovies or the traditional egg yolk at all, as a matter of fact it is much better without them!  Will be making this a lot in my family!

I also follow this recipe to a "T", there is absolutely nothing that has to be changed (except to double it because it is so yummy!!)
My only "tips" are that I put all the dressing ingredients in the blender and mix it up that way - very quick and no "touching" the anchovies:-) Also a time saver for me is to put the garlic in the oil and saute it then drizzle it over the croutons, mix well and spread out on a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake for about 10-15 minutes in a 350 degree oven.
Awesome recipe - have been using it for a while now and every time it's a hit! Thanks

this was delicious!! i loved the dressing... sooo good, i made it without anchovys because i dont like them and it was still bomb! make sure you keep the dressing on the side and let people dress their own salad because if you let this mayo based dressing sit on the lettuce i'll become soggy, same with the croutons! i definetly recommend making this because it was so easy too!

Wow!! Finally a homemade dressing that I am in love with. I only changed a few things...I didn't use anchovies as I didn't have any and not sure they will ever cross my door. I also used a little less mayo(just 1/2 cup). I bumped up the worcestershire to a tablespoon as well as the dijon. Overall great flavour, didn't need to use the blender. Just used a whisk. This ones a keeper :)

One of the best dressings I've had in my life. I don't eat mayo, so I used 2 tablespoons of Philadelphia Cooking Creme instead (enough for 3 servings) and it turned out great! It was simply delicious. I'll never buy bottled Caesar dressing ever again. This one is a keeper and I'll definitely make it again and again.

Love, Love, Love this!  I've made it several times and use this exact recipe, mixed up in the food processor or blender.  I prefer my croutons in butter, but otherwise don't make any modifications.  So easy and delicious!  I usually make a double batch and we enjoy it all week.  (Once I taste it, I want it again and again!)

The thought of using mayo instead of the traditional raw egg yolk wasn't my thing so I subbed the mayo for a single egg yolk and the texture was perfect for me. I didn't add any salt though, between the anchovies and the parmesan I don't see why you'd want more salt in this. I mixed everything with an immersion blender and the dressing turned out beautifully. My boyfriend suggested that we use roasted garlic next time; I think it'd add a hint of sweetness that would work well with all the strong flavors. We drizzled a little more lemon juice on afterward and served it with grilled chicken breast.

This is the perfect Caesar salad dressing recipe.  Everyone loved it.  It's always best to use high quality parmesan cheese and I also used anchovy paste instead of whole ones.  I used the left over dressing to make chicken caesar sandwiches the next day which were a hit.  I will only use this recipe from now on.  thanks!

better than the store bought ones but still not perfect like the one I get at many restaurants. I halved the amount of garlic using only 3 cloves of garlic .I tried it before with the less fat mayo and it was disgusting , always use the original one .

I followed this recipe exactly.  It was too "fishy" for my liking.  It was very rich though and made for a special salad since there was more love put into making it than just using a salad kit.

This was tasty. All the flavors were good. I would, however, thin out the dressing with a little milk or cream, just so that it coats the lettuce a little more.

I've made this soooooooooo many times but tonight was the first time I also made the croutons. It's always great but tonight it was extra special!!! We had it with filet mignon and an excellent reisling. To die for!!! It was Valentines Day!!!!! We saved a TON of money by cooking at home and what an awesome meal. Nothing better then a really great caesar salad! Thanks!

This was just "ok." It definitely doesn't taste like "real" casesar salad, but if you want something quick, this does the trick. This is also good if you don't like the raw egg in traditional caesars.

Use combo of mayo and sour cream.  And add a little milk if needed.

This was the hit of dinner and everyone raved about it - it is true, the secret is in the dressing. I made it earlier that day and stuck it in the fridge to reduce hands on time when company came and it worked out great!

AmAZING!!!! I accidentally used 6 cloves of garlic in the dressing and left out the anchovies because I didn't have any. My guests and family couldn't get enough of this! I bought croutons and real bacon pre-cooked and cut up. Will keep this recipe forever! Thank you!!!!!!!!

Easy and delicious. I was out of Worchestershire sauce so substituted A1 Steak Sauce. Also, wasn't sure if my guests would be happy about the anchovies so I left them out of the dressing and served them on the side, compensating with a little extra salt.

I'll never buy prepared Caesar Salad Dressing again!. This is much better.  If you want an even more garlic flavor, go for it just put in up to three more cloves or leave it as is.

well..lots of mixed reviews...in my opinion if you dont like a pungeant, salty, overpowering taste..STAY AWAY FROM THE ANCHOVIES whether in a paste form or whole....I found the recipe quite good..not a big fan of dijon mustard so I used regular mustard and lots of lemon.  much better than commercially produced dressings. dont be scared by the anchovies really if u adjust the saltiness with the mayonaisse it can be a very flavourful dressing.

I made this dressing in my food processor. It was a little thick, so I thinned it out with a little bit of dry white wine, and it tasted fab. I used extra anchovies because I like them, and extra lemon juice and dijon because I like the tang. Very good.

I made this exactly as written. It was sublime. The thick dressing clung to the lettuce and the croutons were fantastic. "Best caesar salad ever" was the compliment I received (from a seasoned caesar salad eater)

This is nothing near the original recipe for Caesar Salad Dressing.  Where is the raw egg?  So much is missing and this tastes like anything one can purchase in the store..you know all those faux dressings.

I have been using this recipe for years.  It is my favorite Caesar Dressing. I let the food processor do all the work.  I don't make the bread cubes as we like crusty bread on the side. The dressing will keep in the fridge for quite a while, I usually double the recipe so it's there just for a single salad or last minute company.

The best homemade caesar dressing ever.  Opted for anchovy paste so I could disguise it (picky eaters).  Absolutely loved by all.  Will use whole anchovies for non picky eaters next time!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I initially discarded this recipe because it uses mayonnaise rather than raw eggs and olive oil. I was wrong. The best Caesar dressing I have ever had comes from a 5 star restaurant not too far away. This recipe tastes about the same. Yeah! Have made it with anchovy paste and anchovy filets. Making it with filets is just a bit better for some reason.

Made it for a Christmas family gathering and it got rave reviews.  I did it exactly as written, except I made the mistake of not reading the recipe carefully enough, and added the oil meant for the croutons into the dressing!

So far, this recipe is the closest I have found to a good restaurant-quality Caesar salad. The first round, I followed the recipe as written.  My family found it to be a touch too garlicky and anchovy-ish, so the next time I used 2 large heads of garlic and 3 anchovies.  Perfection!  I grated fresh parm on top of the salads and served them on chilled plates with lemon wedges.  The whole family loved it.   Just play around with the garlic and anchovy quantities until you find your liking.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Well deserving 5 stars.  Made exactly as written including the anchovies, and not anchovy paste.  Wonderful, garlicky yet not extreme.  Make well ahead of serving time so the flavors infuse. I felt no need to add salt. Toss just before serving to your lettuce remains crisp. Delicious, thank you Karen Weir.

OMG!!!!!!!!!!!  My family is expert on caesar salad dressing, we eat it all the time.  My 24 year old son says that this is the best dressing he has ever had.  I could not believe that mayo would make it so good,and so much more simple than other rercipes with olive oil and raw egg,etc.  You must try this one. Outstanding !!

This recipe is wonderful.  I can make the dressing and croutons ahead of time, and just throw everything together. It makes a perfect dinner when you add some grilled chicken to it. Like others I leave the anchovy out of the dressing.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Your guests will go back for seconds!  I reduced the garlic, only because garlic in our grocery stores tend to be extremely strong, and it was still strong.  But, as long as everyone is indulging, who cares!!!! Give it a try...you won't be disappointed!

Absolutely loved it! Served this at an Italian Dinner Party for my cooking club, everyone raved. I did make a few adjustments. I minced the anchovies as written and ended up with teeny chunks of anchovy "blobs". I put in my mini-processor. It was also a little thicker than I liked so I added milk and red wine vinegar as another member suggested. So yummy!

Thanks for this recipe. I live in the Netherlands where caesar salad is hard to come by. I used store bought croutons and then served it with "Jenny's grilled chicken breast" (also on allrecipes.com) to make it a "meal". Super simple recipe that could easily be done in single servings. Will definitely make again.  P.S. Wish I knew of this recipe (no raw eggs) when I was craving caesar salad during my pregnancy.

I just made this for my family of 5, with 2 kids home from college - all of whom are BIG caesar salad lovers...very very picky about their dressing. I did not change a thing in the recipe. It was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it.  Said it was the best they'd ever had -including restaurants.  We were out later that evening and out of the blue my husband started talking about how fantastic the salad had been!   

One thing my kids didn't love were the croutons - thought they were "soggy".  I would say they were actually crunchy on the outside and softer on the inside. Even tho' I loved them, next time I will make them 'crunchier' by popping them into the oven after cooking them per the directions on the stove. I'm so happy I found this recipe because it got me huge kudos from my family.  Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!!

This was a great salad. I thought the dressing was a little thick and garlicky, but it was a delicious and authentic-tasting Caesar dressing which can be thinned out with a tablespoon or so of milk and/or olive oil. I crumbled some smoked salmon into salad, added some thin-sliced red onion, and squeezed a lemon wedge on top and it made for a perfect dinner.

Just simply excellent.  I hate Anchovy's but I did use Anchovy paste in this recipie (Found in major grocery chains by the sardines in a tube size box.  The salad was just like I've had at Outback Steak house! I didn't mess with making my own croutons, but used caesar flavored in a bag and this was a great salad, with sauted' ckn.    BRAVO!

Hubby loved this and really appreciated the fact that I made a caeasar salad entirely from scratch!  I followed the dressing recipe to a "T", but I added a little bit of italian seasoning and parm cheese to the croutons and baked them in the oven.

I'm picky with my Caesar dressing, so I was incredibly surprised by how absolutely incredible this turned out.  My husband who is quite the "from scratch" snob almost choked when I told him after dinner that this was a packaged mayonnaise base. He promptly went back to the leftovers (there were a LOT - this recipe makes a TON) and tried to find something he didn't like about it, but couldn't!  Even our five year olds ate it (color me supremely surprised!).  I made it exactly as the recipe is posted.

Very nice. I also omitted the anchovies and used only 3 cloves of garlic and added an extra tbsp. of lemon juice. Probably the best Caesar salad I have had in a very long time.

I made this last week, and it really hit the spot. I put all the dressing ingredients in the food processor (leaving out the lemon since I didn't have one). And I love to make croutons this way! They're sooo bad for you, but sooo good! I used a country french bread from the bakery where I work. Today, I thinned the leftover dressing with some milk and drizzled over sliced fresh tomatoes. Holy mama! It was awesome, better than it was last week, probably from sitting for awhile. Thanks for the recipe!

really good recipe!! i just used the dressing part to complete my lunch. definitely needs something to make it less viscus, i opted for equal parts mayonnaise and olive oil. also, i used lime because it was what i had on hand, and i think it worked really well. thanks for the recipe, will definitely make again

This was very good the second time around. It still tasted too much like mayo so I slowly added vinegar until the taste was just right.

Sorry but I didn't like this one too much, it has way too much mayo, I ended up adding more oil, black pepper, salt and extra lemon juice.  I will stick with my original caesar salad recipe. Thanks anyway.

Excellent!... Don't leave out the anchoivies!... When I first found out anchovies were in my favorite dressing "Caesar" I thought Yuk!... but it doesn't make it  fishy, just adds lots of flavor!  I used anchovie paste (2tsp) and boxed croutons... We love the strong flavor of garlic too... It makes my mouth water thinking about it again.

This was excellent as I am very picky on my caesar salads. In order to make it blend well, I put all ingredients in blender for a great creamy texture. I reduced the mayo to 1/2 cup and added about 1/4 cup of olive oil to reduce the heavyness. ( I am used to making with no mayo). I also added one egg for a fluffy texture and 1-2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar and a dash of tabasco for a zing. It makes it a bit spicy, how I like it, and definitely does not lack flavor. An excellent meal and the dressing is even better the longer it sits.

FIVE STARS!  If any of you have looked at my reviews you will see I rarely rate anything five stars.  I think that I need to actually love it and it must create the WOW factor.  Well this is it!  Super caesar dressing!!!  I am also proud to report as a person who will not eat fish of any kind that yes, I did add the anchovies!  Although only 3 instead of 5 I still added them!  This is such a keeper of a recipe!  I rivals one that I used to eat at a really great restaurant in Boston.  Thanks so much!  This is the best!  One last thing... And I'm not trying to be rude - just make a point.  For all the reviewers that keep writing that it tasted like one you would get in a restaurant  but then say they ommited anchovies...  Almost certainly the one you had in any good restaurant did include anchovies you just didn't know it.  Note:  I did mix it in my food processor to make it smooth and make sure there wasn't anything that looked like it might be a piece of anchovy.  Thanks again for the recipe!  Love it - anchovies and all!

My husband is the biggest caesar salad fanatic. However, he didn't care for this one at all.  He said the mayo is too strong and that's after I used only half of the mayo it called for.  I will not make this one again and continue to search.

This recipe is awesome. My Grandkids went crazy over it, even after they found out there were anchovies in it. It was easy and very tasty. The only thing I did different was I left out the salt, the anchovies made up for it. I will never make another Caesar salad dressing any other way. Thanks for sharing.

This is absolutely delicious. I tone it down a bit as I felt there was too much of the anchovy taste. I make a recipe for 18 servings and this is my measurements: 10 large garlic cloves, 2 1/4 c mayo, 9 anchovy fillets, 4 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese, 3 tsp Worcestershire, 3 tsp Dijon mustard and 3 tbsp lemon juice. I absolutely love this dressing. It is beyond amazing. Thank you!

This salad dressing was incredible even though I was unable to get anchovies or anchovy paste.  I was asked for the recipe by a VERY discerning friend the first time I used it.  I will never buy a bottled caesar dressing again.  Thanks for the posting!

This recipe is without a doubt - the best Caesar Salad you'll ever make. 

I've made it for the last 4 or 5 years and it always gets rave reviews.

My personal preference is less garlic and more parmesan cheese.

I have looked high and low for a good caesar dressing that didn't have a raw egg as one of the ingredients, and I think that I finally found one!  I was disappointed to find that I only had 1/2 cup of regular mayo in my fridge and had to use a reduced fat mayo for the remaining 1/4 cup.  I wasn't interested in making anything low-cal  and was really looking forward to a full flavor dressing.  I was pleased to find that it was still really rich and tasty.  This dressing can certainly be made as a low calorie version.  I will certainly make this dressing again and again.  Thanks!

Definitely too much Mayo!!  I had to add extra mustard, worchestire and lemon juice to tone down the strong mayo taste.  After that it was DELICIOUS!!

Cut back on the mayo just a bit per reviewers suggestions.  The dressing was great but the croutons didn't do it for us.  I would make this again using a different recipe for the croutons.

wow!  I made this for my very picky boyfriend who happens to love caesar salad and he was extremely impressed!  He said it was one of the best he's had and didn't mind eating it for dinner and lunch.  just be careful how much garlic you put in - you can get away with less than what the recipe calls for.  i didn't bother with the anchovies and that taste was still perfect.  the croûtons didn't come out that well but that was my mistake.  overall, the dressing itself is spectacular, tasty and very easy to make.  this will become a staple recipe in our house.

Finally!  A fantastic caesar salad recipe that is easy to make!  I don't eat anchovies, so left those out and the dressing was awesome.  Loved the croutons and added real bacon bits. YUM....  :)

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't like the dressing that much, too much mayo taste for me. I liked the home made croutons with it, but to be honest I threw the dressing away because I just didn't love it.

I made this yesterday, for Good Friday to eat with our fish, this salad was amazing!! I made a few changes as did other people. I only used 3 cloves of garlic and opted to use anchovy paste instead of the fillets. Other than that, i wouldn't change a thing!
Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Soooooo yummie.  I used more garlic to make it spicier and both ways are awsome.  I also used less mayo and thinned it out with some olive oil so it coats the salad better.  Everyone who tries this asks for more...it's perfect :)  Try it over pizza crust with shaved parmesean cheese on top for a pretty adn delicious appitizer!

This is the best Caeser salad ever!! I had no idea it would turn out so good, especially since I didn't have some of the ingredients!! I made it anyway because I was craving Caesar salad and I was not disappointed!! I omitted anchovies & dijon (didn't have any on hand) & subsituted parmasan for grated mozzerella.  Even my son ate this and he NEVER eats salad!! I couldn't believe the spicy rich 'bite' this salad had.....and it was sooooo creamy!!! And the homemade croutons were fabulous!!! I put everything in the blender , as recommended & added a touch of milk to help it blend better. I want to make another one right now, but it's almost midnight :-)...thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

Oh my gosh this is so good!!! Just don't make the mistake I did.  I went ahead and bought croutons... but I didn't read the recipe and I put in all 6 cloves of garlic!!! Luckily I caught it in time and went a head and doubled it.  
This was very simple to make- I put everything in my mini-prep and gave it a whirl! I was very scared of the anchovies, but I went ahead and used 2.  I am very glad I did!!!
D E L I S H ! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Good but a little too much garlic for us. Maybe it was the combo between the garlic & dijon that did it. I will cut back on the garlic next time but will make this again.

Cannot say enough about this dressing. It's the absolute best. The only thing 
I do different is to omit the anchovies out of personal preference. We also use store bought fat free croutons, just to cut some time and omit some fat. We always keep this made up in the fridge, lasts quite a few days. The family also uses the dressing as a dip for preztels, makes an awesome dip too!!!! No need to ever purchase ceasar dressing again. Have also had rave reviews when I bring this dressing and a salad to holiday dinners.

This recipe has been on here for years and I still love it. I use 2 tsp. of anchovy paste in place of the filets and it always comes out great. Keep in mind you don't need to add much salt though after that. I usually make it the night before and often use low fat mayonaise... no one notices the difference. The biggest plus of this recipe is that you don't have to worry about eating raw egg. I love it and keep on loving it!!! Yum!!!

This dressing is fantastic.  I should have reviewed this prior to now.  This is the only caesar dressing I use now.  Forget that store-bought stuff.  The whole family enjoy this.  I even told the kids there were anchovies in it after they had eaten it a few times and they were shocked!  BUT, they still like it after their initial disgust over the fact that there are anchovies.  We use the paste that you can purchase at the store and the little one (10 yr old) likes to squeeze it from the tube...

My husband LOVES this recipe.  It is better than any bottled Ceasar dressing.  I haven't made it in a while and forgot that I normally use the anchovy paste rather than the fillets.  I realized it when I was halfway through chopping up the filets.  The taste is pretty much the same but I prefer the paste.  It is more convenient and easier to store than the actual filets.  I think I like the taste a little better as well since the paste can distribute more evenly.  Overall the recipe is awesome and definately the only Ceasar dressing we will use.

I Loved the taste of this.  I didn't use anchovies and left out the croutons but I'm sure they're just as delicious.  I also added lots of pepper for a little kick.  Anyone watching their carbs knows that the same old caesar can get pretty blah.  This dressing is sooo much better than my usual bottled dressing and a welcome change.  I'll use this one from now on. Thanks.

I made this last night for my parents and my aunt and uncle.  It was a huge sucecss!  My mother "claimed" she didn't like anchovies, but loved it in this dressing and my uncle said it was the best salad he had ever had.  I didn't use as many achovies and added more lemon juice and it was perfect!  I paired it with Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili and together it was the perfect combination for a light family dinner.

This was the first caesar dressing I have tried, that had the anchovies. I was expecting it to be very good as all the bottled versions contain anchovy. I have made caesar dressing with the raw and egg and lemon juice etc.,and it was quite good.
   This recipe was just awful. The overwhelming taste of anchovy was sickening. I don't understand it. All the good reviews this recipe received, and I had to throw it out, nobody is going to eat salad that is fishy tasting.
   It is too "garlicky" also. I would love to taste someone elses', just could not believe it was sooooo bad.

Great recipe. Anchovy paste is a great alternative.  Use ceasar croutons if pressed for time.

i was afraid that this would be over-powering, b/c when i taste-tested the dressing before i refrigerated it, it was kinda fishy, but on the salad, it was great and did not taste fishy at all.  Our family loves ceasar salads, so this will become a regular!

Great recipe-  the dressing is awesome.  I bake my croutons after tossing them with olive oil and garlic.  I then salt and pepper them and finish them off with grated parm- bake til crispy and yum.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is truly the best Caesar I've ever eaten! Hubby is the only family member who eats anchovies, so unfortunately for him, he lost out on this one. No matter, the dressing was still fabulous. I used a half of a cup of mayo and a quarter cup of olive oil. My younger daughter who will not go near bottled Caesar dressing devoured this salad and went back for seconds. Thanks so much Karen!!

This was a great ceasar salad.  I was able to sneak the anchovies in the dressing and my husband didn't know they were there.  He really liked it too.  I've made the dressing and use it on alot of other salads and things.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just like Renees!  I opted out of the anchovies (not a fan) and used jarred chopped garlic and it was awesome!  Very easy and quick. Will definately keep this recipe in the recipe box!

Absolutely the best caesar dressing ever.  The only thing I didn't do was add the anchovies because I can't stand them.  The dressing was on the thick side so I just added a little bit of water. Besides that I wouldn't change a thing.  Absolutely fabulous.

I have been making the same caesar salad recipe for 20 years, it is completely different from this recipe.  My husband and I really enjoyed this one.  I added an extra clove garlic to the dressing.  The crotons were to die for.  The bread really sucked up the oil when browning.  Had to added extra oil to brown second batch.  We had the leftover dressing with salad the second night with store bought crotons.  It was almost as good but the homemade crotons were extra nice.
Excellent thanks, michele, cambridge ontario

this was fantastic!  i mixed it up and served almost right away- i think it will taste better tonight after the flavors have a chance to mix together a little more.  i used just a little garlic.  served with the garlic croutons on this site.  will use again & again!  UPDATE-doesn't taste better the second day, which is disappointing, but oh well.  it loses some of the bite.  will make in smaller amounts for one time use.

Excellent!  I was wondering what the mayo would do to this, but it's fine with it.  I added about 3 extra cloves of garlic and about another tblspn. of cheese because it needed extra zing as was.  It is thick but it worked fine on the lettuce, I too added a few drops of olive oil to it and it was super.  I am a ceasar salad fanatic where they make it table side at nice restaurants, and this is just as good as any I've had, and I've had many good ones!!  Thanks for the easy keeper!!P.S. Please keep the anchovies in, they are essential in caesar dressing and I hate them, but wouldn't dream of leaving them out.  For those of you who say you can't tell the difference, have you actually put them in and tasted to see???

This dressing was amazing! Lots of garlic and very creamy. I left out the anchovies since my husband doesn't like them, but it was still the Caesar taste I love. I added milk to thin it rather than oil and substituted 1/2 cup plain yogurt for some of the mayonnaise. Very easy to make, and inexpensive too.

I have never had anyone rave about croutons before, but these are worth raving about. I would definitely recomend getting a nice firm crafted bread from the store to make them, they turn out so delicious and add to the recipe so well. This is incredibly easy to make, and a classic taste that harkened me back to the Caesar Salad i had at Romeo Y Julliettas in Cabo San Lucas. 
I would use a little more anchovy next time. Be sure to leave the garlic that you saute in the oil large enough to "fish out" after you are done infusing. 
Have a ball with this award winning recipe.

I thought the dressing was awesome!  I opted to use the anchovy paste also.  I wasn't sure what the conversion was from 5 fish so I just used 1/2 teaspoon.  I was generous with the mustard, worcest., and lemon.  It is fantastic!  I doubled the recipe so I could have it all week!  Thanks so much!!!!

I suggest tossing the romaine in the dressing and not just having it on the side. I LOVE this dressing.  Added 1/4 cup of olive oil to the mayo mixture for a smoother texture.

I made the dressing in the food processor, using anchovy paste instead of the full fish.  It was delicious, but honestly I would only make this again if I wanted the "home made" taste. I don't mind the high end bottled dressing, and this dressing didn't impress me enough to switch completely.

Absolutely wonderful. This was my first attempt at homemade Caesar and I'll never buy the bottled stuff again. I didn't add the anchovies b'cause my family freaked when I took them out of the pantry so I opted against - I don't know how it could have been any better but next time, I may add the anchovies when no one is looking just to see what it's like with them. Also used fresh parmesan and a lot more of it than the recipe calls for. A delicious and easy shortcut for the croutons is to buy a loaf of garlic bread in the bakery section. Just cut it into big cubes, toss w/ olive oil and parmesan, and toast in the oven.

I had always shied away from making homemade caesar dressing because of the raw egg.  Now I'll never buy a bottled caesar again!  This is so good and couldn't be easier.  Use anchovy paste instead of mincing whole ones and wasting half the can!  It's just as good.

Excellent caesar salad recipe - tastes similar to the one made by Outback Steakhouse.  My family loves it!  I add chicken breasts done in my George Foreman grill on top - perfect!  I don't care for the croutons, though, so I omit them and use prepackaged.

Very flavorful. At first I thought it was going to be to thick but once you toss the lettuce with the dressing it was fine-didn't even have to use all the dressing so I saved the rest!

I now use this as my staple Caeser dressing. I add a little bit of buttermilk to thin it to my preference though and only use 2-3 anchovies. Thanks for the recipe!

I must admit.....I am surprised how great this dressing is.  I added some water to the mayo to make it less thick (just a 2 tablespoons and I stirred it in well).  I have already made it 3 times in one week.  I used "sauce-style" mayo and it was still great.  Thanks so much.  This is a keeper!!!

This salad rocks.  Everyone I've make it for loves it and they usually ask me for the recipe.  Try pressing the achovies through the garlic press after the garlic.  It give the creamy dressing a nice texture.

Man ! This is an AWESOME recipe !  It was so wonderful to find while I was pregnant and couldn't have raw eggs ( typically called for in most caesar recipes).  This recipe is so good that even now that the little sweetheart is 16 months old, this is now MY caesar recipe.  An added bonus, this dressing never breaks like my other one did.  A great sauce for not only salads, but sandwiches too.  For Atkins followers, a nice treat is to rip up bite sized pieces of romaine and place on a platter around a bowl of this dressing ( dip).  Now you have something to snack on during the movie while the others have their chips etc !

There was way too much garlic in the dressing for my taste and I usually like garlic.  I have to admit it was still very tangy and tasty.  My boyfriend absolutely loved the dressing and said that is how it's supposed to taste, so I will make this again with less garlic.  I also used 2 teaspoons of anchovy paste which worked wonderfully.

Very good!  I didn't have time to make croutons so I used storebought Caesar croutons.  Everybody loved it!

Awesome salad.  Just like in restaurants, even better. I also used anchovy paste rather than fillets.  Excellent!!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I didn't think you could make a decent caesar salad dressing without olive oil but this is better than any other creamy dressing I have tried (and I have tried lots).  I will not look for a better one. Yummy!

Very good!  I added about 3/4 cup water to the dressing since some reviews said it was too thick.  I also added red onions and more garlic because my family loves both!  Anchioves are a nice addition without anyone really even knowing they are in there.

The most amazing dressing!  I've searched long and hard for a caesar dressing that excludes the raw egg.  I keep a batch of the dressing in my fridge at all times.  Rinsing the anchovies cuts the "fishy" taste.

Highly recommended.  I will not be looking anymore for a good caesar salad dressing since this one is fantastic.  I used anchovy paste and added a little of olive oil.

Although this recipe was good, it was a little too strong.  I will try again, but only add one thing at a time until I figure out what it was that was too strong for my taste buds.  Either the Dijon mustard, or the anchovy fillets?

I thought that this recipe was pretty good.  I left the anchovies out because I don't like them. I was the only one that ate it, so I probably won't make again.

I made this salad for Christmas Eve dinner.  Everyone really liked it--especially the homemade croutons.  I would have never thought making croutons would be so easy!  The dressing has a nice zip.

I didn't add the anchovy fillets as my husband doesn't like them and the taste was still very good.  We really liked the croutons, I made them from french bread that I made on the weekend.  Yummy!! Served with seafood lasagne and crusty rolls.

I skipped the homemade croutons, only made the dressing. I made it per the recipe, no substitutions or changes. Delicioso! 2x the dressing uses 1 can of anchovies almost perfectly -- there were 12 or 13 anchovy fillets in the can, so I snacked on the excess. :D Quit hating on the anchovies, people. My supermarket sells romaine hearts 3 per pack, and 2x the dressing suited that amount of romaine almost perfectly too, for us (we like to go a little heavy handed on dressing). I love love LOVE that there wasn't much leftover anchovies or romaine, as I don't use those ingredients often. I used the salty, anchovy-flavored oil from the anchovies can and some seafood seasoning to pan fry some shrimp -- it made a great topping on this salad!

This is really good has wonderful flavor but I think 3/4 cup mayo is too much.  It makes the dressing too thick.  Needs to be thinned down with olive oil.  Next time I will make as directed except only using 1/3 cup mayo and balancing it out with perhaps 1/2 cup of olive oil? Anybody else think this was too thick?

This is THE Caesar salad dressing recipe.  You will never need another.  Followed to a T, it is the perfect balance of umami, creamy, salty, bright acidity, and garlicky goodness.  Every ingredient on the list is necessary to make Caesar dressing taste like Caesar dressing should.  Just follow the recipe and you'll be convinced.  Trust me, I've tried many, many, many variations of this salad.  This is THE winner.
A couple of bonus tips/ideas:
1 - If you're in a hurry to eat, make a garlic paste (using the side of your knife and some salt as an abrasive, to mash the minced garlic) instead of adding minced garlic.  The flavor will infuse into the rest of the ingredients more immediately, and you won't have any tiny, pungent garlic bits to bite into.  Otherwise, this dressing is best if it sits for at least 30min-1hr before you use it.
2 - You can absolutely sub some yogurt for the mayo  if you're looking for a healthier twist.  You'll just need a touch more salt, and to use the dressing within a week or so.
3 - Fresh anchovies have a sweetness and rich brininess is not perfectly replicated with anchovy paste, which is more pungent and not as complex.  It's worth paying attention to that part, but I do need to sub paste from time to time and this recipe is still FANTASTIC.
4 - I now almost always add a Tbsp or two of dry white wine to this dressing.  I love how it both creates what I think is the perfect viscosity and releases the aromatics of the other ingredients, beautifully.

I was looking for a Caesar salad dressing which did not contain raw eggs and I came across this. Excellent recipe!!! Being pregnant I should avoid raw eggs thus my search for this dressing. I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of using anchovy paste (1.5 tsp)  instead of real anchovies because that's what I had on hand. Next time I will use real anchovies instead of the paste. Delicious with the paste but it was thick!! If I use paste again I may add some EVOO to thin it out a little. I served this for a dinner party and received raved reviews. The key is to really mix the dressing & other ingredients together to achieve perfect homogenization. Serving this as a starter for thanksgivings. Thank you for the recipe!

I love caesar salads, so I was a little skeptical about making this dressing  myself.  I certainly did not expect it to come near to what I get at restaurants, but boy was I wrong.  It was the best Caesar dressing I think I have ever had.  My husband and guests did not look very excited when I served it, but one taste and they were converts.  I would suggest making it early or the night before and letting it sit in the refrigerator to allow the flavors to blend even more.  Rather than frying the croutons, I just tossed the bread cubes lightly in olive oil, spread them on a cookie sheet, sprinkled them with some garlic salt, and baked at 325 degrees, turning them often, until they were toasted (about 20 minutes).

You just cannot put mayo in a salad and expect it to be anything like the real thing.  Try a whole (I like jumbo) egg yolk and follow the rest of the recipe.

This was so good and better than any restaurant Caesar dressing I've ever had. I ate more salad than the meal itself! It is a bit time consuming but so worth it. Will definately make more often.

I found a way to get my kids to eat salad - make this recipe! I've made this twice in the last week (I did not make the croutons - just used store bought croutons). The dressing is delicious just as is, I did not change a thing. I'll be making this one often. Thanks!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! It's our special occasion dinner, steak and Caesar salad. The only thing I did differently was use anchovy paste instead of fillets and I used about 3-4 garlic cloves. 6 was a little too intense for us.

Best recipe I've tried for Caesar dressing.  I skipped the croutons as I was pressed for time and just threw everything in the mini blender - amazing!!!

I have never made a Ceasar dressing myself before, and this recipe made for a pretty food first! I would make it in advance though for the garlic flavour to permeate more, as we had leftovers the next day and it tasted even better. Loved it and will use this recipe again.

This is the absolute best caear dressing I've ever had!! My husband is a HUGE caesar salad fan but I have never liked it.. UNTIL now. I can not get enough of this stuff!!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't make any changes what so ever.  The croutons are to die for!!! I now make this 2-3 times a week. I can not say enough good things about this recipe!! FANTASTIC!!!

I and all of my dinner guests absolutely LOVED this  Caesar dressing.  The only thing I did different was, instead of the 5 anchovy fillets, I used a teaspoon of anchovy paste.  It was excellent!!  I've made it 3 times since...can't get enough!

Very good dressing, I used anchovy paste instead and it was awesome, outstanding flavor, was a bit thick but I thinned it out with some whipping cream. All in all a keeper for sure!!

I don't add salt, it's already in the cheese and anchovies
I Iuse whole grain Dijon instead of ground (Maille is a good brand);
If you think you don't like anchovies you can skip them and its still good, but even the "haters" don't know they're in there..or use anchovy paste so you don't see the pieces;
I mix everything together and add mayo last so it's all blended...use up to a full cup of mayo;
Remember the garlic gets stronger the next day if you make it ahead.......

After you make this, restaurant Ceasars will taste inferior to your own homemade!

The salad dressing was absolutely over the top delicious!!! As good as any we get in a restaurant, and better than many restaurants. I did not make the croutons as I did not have enough time, but will try them in the future. I had never used anchovies before, and in fact, avoided any recipes that called for them. But I decided to bite the bullet and try it. I did use anchovy paste instead of fillets, but I doubt that this made much difference in taste. We served this over Romaine lettuce with grilled chicken and store bought croutons.  If you try this, you should love it!!!!!

I was skeptical, being a purist who always uses the raw egg yolk, but oh-my-gosh, this dressing was fabulous! And the leftover dressing keeps for a bit, so that's a good thing. But do use the anchovies! It's for the "umami " --doesn't taste like fish at all in the dressing. The ONLY thing I did differently was use English muffins in place of plain white bread. It's a must to sautée them in the oil but you won't believe how well the texture of those muffins works in Caesar salad!

I chose finely chop it as the recipe directs. I used butter lettuce rather than the mixed greens which made this a very "sturdy" salad for lack of a better way of describing it, tho' I'm sure the submitter would agree any lettuce or salad greens would be perfectly suitable. I felt good serving as well as eating this salad - not only is it pretty and delicious, but it's so heart healthy! Eating this you felt like you were really doing something good for yourself (as well as your tastebuds!) This, along with crab cakes, made for a light but satisfying meal.

This was just amazing! I didn't have real anchovies on hand so I used anchovie paste. I didn't know how much to use so I looked up Anchovy Equivalents: 1 anchovy fillet = 1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste.  Next time I plan to make this I will get some whole anchovies.  Thanks for sharing! So yummay!

Thanks for the recipe! 

I've made this dressing a few times now. This is an excellent recipe. 

I tried a version with minced garlic and a version with fresh garlic. Because this recipe asks for 6 cloves, I think the minced is the way to go. When I used fresh, it was waaaay too garlicky!

I think I'll try to reduce the mayonnaise next time. A little too fatty for my liking. However, the texture is excellent.  I did use a food processor - it isn't necessary, but it helps with the texture and flavor.

I made so much this time, I am freezing it for future salads. Perhaps, add some grilled chicken for a quick meal or maybe make a wrap.

Wow-awesome!! I did use anchovy paste (Sorry to the purists but I hate working with the fish). Other than that, followed to the letter and it was amazing. I put salmon on it for protein as many restaurants do that (you could add chicken, shrimp etc.) LOVE not using raw egg-genius!!

Excellent classic caesar dressing from a salad connoisseur.  I mixed it all up in my VitaMix which sped it up nicely.  It is very garlicky so I think I'll use one clove next time.  Very authentic if you don't like the ranch-y taste like in restaurants.

Just finished making this dressing - followed the recipe exactly.  My family is now having a friendly debate over who gets to finish the salad.  LOL.  SUPER GOOD.  In fact, I just returned to ALLRECIPES to look for a mayo recipe so I can make more caesar dressing.  On a personal note I just looked up and discovered that my son won the debate, and he is happily chomping down on the remaining salad.  Yes indeed, this recipe is a keeper.

Taste amazing.  I already had croutons so I just used some also I had no artichoke so I did not use it but everything I used just as the recipe asked and it taste wonderful.  Will do this salad again for sure. Also I had no Romane lettuce so I just used a head of iceburg lettuce.

Ok... I had my doubts. I was ready to eat a surrogate of one of my favorite salads probably liking it but not loving it... And then I had the first bite. Wow! People, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE.
It is just as good as the real deal! It tastes just like restaurant served Cesar salad!
My mom has been looking for a Cesar salad recipe that she can reproduce easily anywhere in the world (she lives in Germany) and trust me this is it.
I'm not a big fan of anchovies, but reading the reviews I decided I had to put the exact ingredients that the recipe stated so I made the dressing with 5 filets, I didn't have time to make the bread the day before and decided to use what I had on hand even if it was somehow fresh and it turned just fine.
The only thing I would omit next time is the salt. No need since the anchovies and the grated Parmesan are pretty salty already... But for the rest I will make this recipe over and over again just as is!

I made it exactly as written and it is so delicious!!! Don't be afraid of the anchovies; use the full amount. I used real mayo and fresh lemon juice. I've made homemade Caesar dressing before with the raw egg, etc and it was great. But this is better!

After I followed it to the letter, I would reduce the garlic to 1 or 2 cloves and thin it out with a little more lemon juice. Other than that, it is an excellent recipe.

I couldn't find a review by someone who actually followed the recipe; but I thought I'd give it a try just the way it is written.  WOWZA!  This recipe is amazing and I would definitely make it again...just not too often because the anchovies are a pain to mince, but WORTH IT!  Thank you!!

I have never made my own Caesar dressing before but this was easy and awesome!  My dad and hubby said it was the best Caesar salad they have ever had.  I did omit the anchovies (just because my husband hates to taste any fish in his Caesar).  I know that's kinda an important ingredient in Caesar dressing but you make it for your audience so I left it out.  Also I, totally by accident, dumped a TON of Worcestershire sauce in (thought I had the shaker top on when I actually had unscrewed the entire cap).  Ended up tasting great so I'd say use a heavy hand with the Worcestershire (as well as the parm). I also added a little white wine vinegar just to thin it a little and give it a tang.  All in all, this recipe is a great base that you can easily adapt to suit your taste.  Just remember that any mayonnaise based dressing will taste mayonnaise-y until it sets for at least a few hours (I always try to make those kinds of dressings the day before).

This turned out great. However, I did not make the croutons. I just used store bought ones. It tastes like a caesar salad from a restaurant! The dressing is very bold, but good. For those of you who think you should leave out the anchovies, I hope you all know that if you eat a caesar salad at a restaurant, it DOES have anchovies in the dressing. You don't directly taste them in the dressing. They are essential to caesar dressing! No need to be afraid of them.

I just made this Caesar recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe called. It is absolutely delicious. Thought I made use the other reviewers ideas about the red wine vinegar and milk. After making the dressing as the recipe, it did not need one thing. I love it!!!!!
Note: if you use anchovies, use very little or no salt. Anchovies are already salty. This dressing had me licking the spoon from the food Processor. Cant wait to make it for my daughter who loves chix Caesar salad.

WOW! This salad is amazing...the only thing different that I did was sprinkle the croutons (while still in the frying pan) with Johnny's garlic powder. I love garlic. The dressing is amazing, I doubled the batch and made two salads.

Our new home favorite! The dressing is a bit thick, but a little goes a long way if you take the time to mix it up well. Allowing the dressing to rest of a couple of hours before serving helps the flavors blend beautifully.

We have been making this caesar salad dressing for years and love it.  We even make up a big batch every year and give it to friends and neighbors for Xmas gifts.  It is the best!!!!
We make it exactly as printed -- maybe being a little heavy handed with the garlic!

As serious Caesar salad connoisseurs, I followed this recipe exactly as written. Real anchovies are the key. It is outstanding. I wouldn't change a thing and my husband loved it. When trying these recipes, I feel it is only fair to the author to try them exactly as submitted and then you can tweak it, if you choose to make it again. Thanks for sharing!

If I could rate this higher I would. what a good solid recipe I grilled some chicken and that flavor from the grill went so well with the dressing, I did cheat and used store bought crutons, fresh and refreshing for summer.

I followed the recipe exactly. Wow, this rivals Caesar salads at Macaroni Grill and Carraba's! I thought about blending it, but glad I just followed directions. Love the earthy texture of the dressing. One piece of advice is to keep the lettuce very chilled. I added sautéed chicken breast strips and that was a meal.

I have made this recipe as written and it is delicious. However, I've made a few changes over time to suit my own tastes. First, for those of you that think it is too thick or mayo tasting, replace half the mayo with sour cream. Thins it out and gives it a fresher taste. I also use a little more lemon juice and black pepper. Finally, I use peccorino romano in the actual dressing, but shave parmesan to garnish the lettuce. Everyone raves about it, including my salad hating six-year-old. She now loves salad if it has this dressing on it.

I decided to make this for a big dinner I was having. I strongly debated adding the anchovies, as I am not a huge fan of them. After tasting the dressing without it, I decided to venture to the grocery store and just try it. Boy, am I ever glad that I did!! The anchovies added such a depth to the dressing, it just was mind-blowing! I did have to thin it a bit with some olive oil and milk, but it still tasted fantastic. It was a hit! Thanks so much!

Great recipe!  I cut the recipe down to 2 servings (which still was enough for four salads) and followed it as written.  I didn't have the bread, so I skipped the croutons and served it with grilled chicken and avacado.  The dressing is a little thick, but it's not hard to coat the lettuce when you're tossing and the damp lettuce leaves thin it out a bit.  I tried to blender it like others, but it was too thick.  However, it wasn't hard to mix up by hand.  Yummy and no raw egg to worry about!

Great recipe! I served this at Christmas dinner along with lobster tails steamed with beer. My only change would be to change the amount of garlic. It was too overpowering.

I have not stopped making this recipe since I first tried it a few months ago. As per the advice by other reviewers, if you follow the exact recipe, it is a success.  However, the last time I made it I was out of anchovies paste. I added a few extra drops of worcestershire and learned it is not the end of the world to omit this ingredient!  Still good.

I followed the directions completely for half of the recipe, and used minced capers in place of the anchovies for the other half since my husband is allergic to fish. Both were excellent!

I scaled this down to serve 2, even though it was only for me. I was skeptical about the mayo, but I followed the recipe as written, except I used a heavy hand with anchovy paste (I didn't want to have most of a can of anchovies leftover.) I made it in a mini-processor. It was a bit thick, but that didn't bother me.

It was delicious: restaurant quality. (Actually, it was better than the last caesar I had at a fine restaurant.) I ate the whole thing. I'll be making a larger quantity for dinner tonight, so that I'll have enough for another meal or two.

Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Have been on a caesar salad kick lately and was looking for a good caesar dressing recipe I could make at home.  This seemed perfect and included anchovies.  I only skimmed the recipe and looked more at the ingredients.  Realized after dressing was in the fridge that the 1/4 c oil was supposed to be for croutons and not dressing!  Was afraid dressing would taste oily but was pleasantly surprised it was still great.  Had used evoo so don't know if that helped the situation but it's hard to imagine this tasting any better without the oil!  Will definitely be making again soon.  May try and put everything in food processor next time to save time on mincing. Definitely my go-to for now on.

My family LOVES this caesar salad.  I make it all the time, but I make my own croutons with butter, olive oil, and greek seasoning.  Yum!

My husband LOVES Caesar salad, so I thought this would be a fun recipe to try. Not sure what I did wrong, but this did NOT taste like Caesar salad. The dressing had an aftertaste that was just .. off. I used fat-free mayo. Also, the anchovy filets I got were soaked in olive oil and salad, so that might have added additional flavoring (not sure if they sell anchovy filets just by themselves?). I'm thinking the biggest culprit was the mayo, though. Next time, I'd use either light or full-fat mayo. Also, I'd recommend putting in the dressing slowly and adding more as needed - I only used about half.

Also, note to self - either buy Croutons next time, or let them toast until they're HARD. Because some of the bread pieces were still soft, and of course when they went into the salad, they just got even soggier. Soggy croutons = no bueno.

I'm going to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt, considering all the rave reviews, but I think it'll be awhile until I brave making my own Caesar salad again.

My kids and the whole family always love a good caesar salad in restaurants so it prompt me to search for a good recipe.  This recipe caught my attention and tried making it without the anchovy.  I also did not make the croutons as suggested in the recipe as I thought it is optional anyway. I added cooked bacon torn into bits of pieces and chopped walnuts upon serving. My salad taste amazing. This is now one of our favorite dressing. I made it at my BBQ party and it wiped out clean on the plate that I have to make more immediately.  The kids at the party even ate the salad.  Amazing.

Dressing review only: Out of 3 caesar dressings we tried today, this one was the best. Another was close behind, but this one won out, not only by taste but also by visual appeal.

We had one minor change: no dijon on hand so we used regular prepared mustard.

We also made our own mayo by using a technique/recipe from allrecipes. It was so easy and yummy!

This one is a keeper and we will be using this one again...and again....and again for sure!

I only made the dressing to use for 'Pepperoni Caesar Pasta Salad' also from this site...LOVED this dressing! It is a little on the thick side, but that's easy enough to remedy. The flavors are great! I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies and that worked well. I pulsed everything in my mini food processor, so that it would be combined well. I will def be making this again and can't wait to try the whole salad! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe.  My garlic cloves were huge and I knew I should have used less - but didn't listen to my instincts. Wayyyyy too much garlic, I will pay attn to my inner garlic ratio guru next time. I didn't have anchovies and didn't miss them. 
*note: gluten-free adjustments were GF worcestershire and GF bread crumbs.

This recipe is super. Made the dressing in the food processor. I did omit the anchovy. Made the croutons in the oven with garlic powder and olive oil. Topped with a grilled chicken breast and it was a meal all by itself. Terrific.

Simple and easy.  I eyeballed the garlic and put more in most likely.  This seemed too thick so I added a little more lemon juice, and it came out a bit too citrusy.  I love the anchovy taste in this and the fresh parmesan cheese.  I think the next time I make this, I'll use fresh lemon, garlic, and maybe even mayo from scratch.  We served this with grilled chicken breasts, too.

Very good but not quite like a traditional caesar salad dressing. Changed the serving size just enough for me and used a smidge of anchovy paste.

LOVE this recipe -- made it for the first time three weeks ago and have made it 4x since!  So much better than anything in a bottle.  The only change I made was using 1 - 1 1/2 tsp of anchovy paste instead of the fillets (the tube is easier and keeps in the fridge for the next time you make the recipe.)
I didn't have great luck with the homemade croutons - I find them easier to buy.
Updated 3/2013: still loving this recipe.  Always have some in the fridge!

Made it exactly as written, but I prefer a more lightly dressed salad, so I doubled the lettuce and served for a large dinner party. Excellent flavor and consistency.

Loved this recipe but don't love mayo so I adapted the recipe by omitting the mayo and adding olive oil to get the consistency I was wanting.  I accidentally used a TBSP of Worcestershire so I added more lemon to tone it down some I also added about four shakes of tobacco to add a little zing to it.  I made the croutons as suggested.  It was FABULOUS!

Made it as the recipe directed, but too strong a garlic flavor.  Will make again with less garlic, because the rest of it was delicious.

This dressing is delicious.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 tsp of dry mustard instead of dijon (I didn't have it on hand.)

Wonderful! I've been looking for a recipe that does not call for raw eggs or the pasteurized egg product and this will be a keeper!!!  I dared to make this the first time for a dinner party and it was a hit! 

My substitutions: I replaced mayo with organic greek yogurt and used anchovy paste. It was a bit runnier than I would've liked, perhaps due to the yogurt/mayo switch, but it was not at all a problem. I also put everything in a small food processor as suggested and it was great.I made the croutons with home baked whole wheat focaccia and baked the croutons instead of sauteeing them. Thank you so much for sharing!

Very delish!!!  Loved the anchovy, loved the Worcestershire, loved the lemon, loved it all.  I made my husband fall in love with me again over a plate of this salad.  It was good with grilled chicken added, and next time I'm springing for grilled shrimp.  Thank you Karen, and thanks to all those others who commented and shared your tricks of the trade.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  This is so good I can't stop raving about it!!!  We didn't have anchovies or anchovy paste so we just made it as is with the rest of the ingredients and it was to die for!  I can't wait to try it with the anchovies next time :) Thanks you soooooo much for this amazing recipe!!!

Honestly, this dressing is like crack.  The only thing I do differently is to whirl it all up in the food processor so all the parts (anchovies!) are blended in so no one can turn up their nose.  When I make it I am like a kid with cookie dough, scraping up every bit from the container.  This weekend I made a double recipe:  made salad for company and there was not a speck left.  Tonight took the rest and made a chicken pasta caesar salad, adding scallions, cherry tomatoes and red peppers. Yum,yum, yum.  I will never eat another caesar dressing.  Thank you, Karen!!

We love garlic but I had very large cloves and didn't adjust so this was very garlicy.  I make my own multigrain bread and only had this so used it for the croutons and they were great.

I used garlic and butter croutons, did not make my own.  I shaved a wonderful Pecorino on the lettuce and no Parmesan in the dressing.  It was wonderful.

This is a great recepie. It tastes great, easy to make and cheap.
The taste reminded me of Outback Steak house Ceasar Salad.
This is definatly the one I will be making lots of.
I added chicken on the top, and it was the best grilled chicken salad.
Love this recepie!
Thank you!

I doubled this, but followed it to a T including the anchovies. This would be amazing if it had a little less garlic.  I love garlic, but I found this very strong. Watch the size of your cloves if you don't cut back on the amount of garlic.  I put the anchovies and garlic together in a food processor to mince. Worked perfectly.  The croutons also came out amazing.

I've been looking for a great Caesar dressing and this was fabulous! I made some changes after I've made it a few times and that is adding olive oil, double or triple the lemon juice and I use anchovy paste instead of minced fillets. I also don't put Parmesan cheese in the dressing. The croutons are great too!

Definitely a good, basic caesar dressing. My only complaint is that made to measure, it tasted very generic. Many guests assumed it was from a bottle. I was hoping for something a little more gourmet-tasting, considering I'm making it from scratch.

In light of this, I added extra worcestershire, dijon and pepper to taste. This helped somewhat.

Next time: will try WAY less mayo, using olive oil and wine vinegar as a base instead.

definite 5 stars, my husband loves when I make this and says it tastes just like a restaurant caesar. I even leave out the anchovies (he's very weirded out by them) and it still tastes great! the garlic croutons really add to this salad.. no changes, I follow this recipe exactly! I am recently married and just started hosting dinner parties (trying not to mess up) and my guests have raved about this every time! this is my staple caesar recipe :)

So glad to finally find a restaurant-quality caesar salad dressing that's just how I like it! Too many store-bought caesar dressings are similar to italian dressing. This one's super creamy, spicy (in that garlicky way) and packed full of flavor! Don't let the anchovy fillets scare you off either! You can buy anchovy paste and it's just as good an easier to incorporate too! Plus the anchovy paste comes in a tube and will keep for the next time you make the dressing.

Made this salad for a party last weekend. The bowl was practically licked clean. I had to make a second batch. Everyone said it was the best Caesar salad they had ever eaten. I have been craving it ever since.    I made my husband a chicken sandwich with the little salad dressing I had left over and it was incredible as well.    The only change I made was with the croutons. I baked some cubed up rye bread that were covered with a bit of evoo and minced garlic. They were excellent.

very good flavor but you need to add a substantial amount of EVOO so that it is creamy enough. Otherwise it has the thick consistency of mayonnaise.

FUNNY story. So Ive made this twice and we've really liked it. The only thing is I kept wondering why it was so spicey. Well....I accidentally used all the garlic for the dressing (both times) until I finally nocticed. It was great even though I did that...just spicey.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I had made it as a side to the main course, but my boyfriend kept wanting more and more. I doubled the recipe so I can eat this for lunch tomorrow. The only change I made was not using anchovies because my grocery store just happened to be out!

Mmmm. This will spoil you. You will never want bottled caesar dressing EVER...AGAIN...trust me. I'm someone who never ate anchovies before, but let me tell you, I love the taste and I crave this dressing. I'm going to make this dressing tomorrow to go with the Steak Tortellini Caesar salad recipe on this site, see how that goes. I think I actually said, "I'd like to take a bath in this dressing...I'd like to swim in this dressing..." when I first made it. And I meant it! I've made it several times since. It's awesome. --Only addition, I do add an egg to the dressing, for richness. I generally like to coddle the egg for just a minute or two, give the egg a wizz in my mixer and then add it to the dressing. Makes it creamier with more depth. You MUST make your own croutons for this dressing. If you're going to do it, DO IT RIGHT!! YUM!

I followed the directions almost exactly. Like some others, I substituted the anchovy fillets for anchovy paste. There was plenty of dressing left over which is fine because this recipe is so delicious I want to make it again very soon.

TOO MUCH GARLIC FOR ME SO I USE ONLY HALF.  I MAKE UP THE DRESSING AHEAD OF TIME AND STORE IT IN THE FRIDGE FOR LATER.  I DON'T HAVE TO BUY EXPENSIVE STORE BOUGHT DRESSING ANYMORE.

i ve tried this sauce in many different way and here is the best...frist i added little bit capri which gave them an excellent taste...second the sauce was very dry so a little bit of milk and whipping cream should be added and for lower calories you can rub the bread with an olive oil and add some garlic powder then place them for 10 min in the oven they turned out crispy so you dont need to fry them

This is my favorite caesar salad dressing!  I dont make the croutons, just the dressing and I leave out the anchovies only because I never have it on hand, but Im sure they would be great.  I have made this with both regular mayo and also 1/2 light and 1/2 regular and I actually prefer that lighter version better- not as thick.

I really loved the dressing for this...but it made a LOT! Way more than I needed to serve the salad two times. That's the only thing I'd change next time...making a lot less! Thanks for a good recipe...I rarely eat Caesar salad out because the pre-made dressings suck!

I am a Caesar Salad fanatic. I can not go to any restaurant and not order it, I just love it.  I have had good ones and bad ones over the years.  I've tried making it at home and just couldn't get the right mix of things for the dressing and I absolutely love anchovies and they are a must in my Caesar Salad.  So I decided to try this because of all the great reviews and I did not change one thing, I followed this puppy to a T.  This is positively the best Caesar Salad I have ever had.  The dressing is divine!!!  Yes, it is very thick, but that is another reason I liked this.  It clings to each lettuce piece beautifully.  If people are worried about it being too fattening and to save on calories, I usually use a small side bowl with the dressing in it and dip my fork in the dressing then in the salad.  You are then not sacrificing anything, but the calories, all the wonderful taste of any dressing is right there with every bite.  Thank you Karen so much for sharing this recipe.  I will never ever buy all these upteen million bottles of Caesar dressing when I found the perfect one right here and I can make it myself.  Thank you again!!!

I got rave reviews on the dressing for this salad. I'm not a huge fan of romaine so I used green and red leaf lettuce (which has more nutrients anyway) instead. I also omitted the anchovies because I didn't have them on hand - I just threw a little salt and cracked black pepper into the dressing instead and it was tasty! Thank you for therecipe!

I only made the dressing, but it was EXCELLENT! I used the 'Croutons' recipe on this site, just because it was quicker/less ingredients and also made blackened salmon using rub from 'Blackened Tuna Steaks with Mango Salsa ' recipe also on this site. It was a wonderful meal!!

OMG, yum, yum, yum!  This was awesome!  I left out the anchovies because I didn't have any, and it was fabulous anyway.  I used packaged croutons to save time and added some cooked rotisserie chicken.  Hubby and I both loved it.  So quick, easy and tasty; thanks for sharing!

Great!!  I LOVE caesar salads and this recipe is so easy.  Here are the things I did a bit differently . . . 1. I didn't make the croutons like the recipe.  I used olive oil to lightly coat my old bread, seasoned with Italian seasons, pepper, salt, baked at 350  for about 10-15 minutes (stir if necessary).  2. Used Kraft olive oil mayo.  3. I only used 1 tsp of anchovy paste and thought it was just fine.  4. I let the dressing sit overnight and it was thick.  However, I rinsed my lettuce and once the dressing was in it and tossed, it was just fine.  The water from the lettuce worked perfectly as a thinning agent.  5. I tossed some shredded parmesan cheese in with the salad. 6. One batch covered a 10 oz bag of romaine lettuce with a bit of dressing to spare (depending on your taste).

This is a very good salad, we really enjoyed it! I used packaged croutons because I didn't have any day old bread to make them. I followed the dressing recipe exact, and although it was great, I think it needed more lemon juice. The flavors of the anchovies and garlic are perfect, but to me the overall taste was the mayo. It just seemed to be missing a bit more tang. I would probably make this again. Thaks for sharing :)

Yummy! This was great! I, like almost everyone else, made quite a few changes. It was super thick so I added 3 T. red wine vinegar and 1/2 c. milk (we like thin dressing, but it coated the salad perfectly). I also added more parmesan and omitted the anchovies because I didn't have any. Altogether delicious!

This was the creamiest, tastiest dressing ever.  It was wonderfully tangy and absolutely perfect. I followed the recipe only substituting anchovy paste- 1/2 tsp per anchovy fillet, otherwise i didn't change anything.  This will definitely get made again!!

Very good stuff. I did use anchovy paste rather than fillets since thats what I had on hand. Next time I think I will use butter in place of the oil as we just thought the croutons tasted a bit to oily . However, this is still a 5 star recipe all the way!! I'm fussy about my caesar salad therefore rarely get to have one but now I can enjoy them at home anytime I want!!! Thx for the recipe.

I made this salad for a monthly dinner club and it was a hit!  Even those that usually shy away from anchovies loved it.  I needed to serve nine so I used about 1 1/2 heads of lettuce and there was still plenty of dressing.  Will definetely make again.

Yum, my lettuce plants had produced so much lettuce that needed using that I gambled and fed a lettuce based salad to a group that included only 3 girls and a whole bunch of guys and it all disappeared!  Yum, made exactly as written and no need to change anything.

Really great!  I made it yesterday and I may make it again tonight!  Everyone loved this salad.  I agree with another reviewer....I will never, ever buy bottled caesar dressing again!   I didn't use anchovies(because I didn't have any) but it was still excellent.  I also used plain old Kraft canned parmesan but next time will use a chunk of good parm.  (I usually keep some in the freezer and just grate it in the magic bullet, but happened to be out of it)  Thank you for this recipe!

Everyone loved it - added maybe a tablespoon of milk to loosen it up a bit.  The croutons are weird and unnecessary.  Next time, I would use the Garlic Crouton recipe on this site.

I skipped the anchovy only because I completely forgot at the store... but the dressing is out of this world.. I used a fresh block of parmesan, I didn't measure the amount of parmesan, but I used way more then it said to.. (seriously can there ever be enough parm cheese in anything?!). I also added more lemon juice and thinned it out with olive oil, then it still seemed to thick, so I added a bit of milk. will N-E-V-E-R buy caesar salad dressing again.

Love this! Caesar salad is always a favorite, and the "mayo shortcut" gives this 5 stars for both taste AND ease of preparation. Made this "as written." Just went an extra 1/2 T. on the lemon for that extra "bite" (which MAKES Caesar salad for me...)  Wouldn't change a thing. Wonderful with so many things or as a stand-alone.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

It was ok.  I didn't care for the mayo taste in the dressing.  It needed a lot more lemon juice and it was just an ok dressing.  Not sure I'd make it again.

FIVE stars alll the way!  Delicious JUST as written!! (Actually, I'm just rating the salad part b/c I had store-bought garlic croutons that I have to use up).  I will ALWAYS make caesar salad like this from now on!

Fine dining quality dressing!  I made as written except used anchovy paste instead of whole anchovies.  The dressing was very thick, so I thinned it out slightly with some milk and olive oil.

We love this recipe, the dressing is the best.  Make sure you use the anchovies even if you think you don't like them. Also put some on the salad (chopped). The home made croutons are an important part of the salad. I follow the recipe to a T. Please don't use anchovy paste or store bought croutons.

The dressing was wonderful!! I followed the recipe exactly as written. My only change was to put all the ingredients in a mini food processor to blend. The dressing turned out perfectly smooth. I'm not a huge anchovy fan, but the dressing flavor was delicate and improved the overall recipe. It does have a lot of garlic, which we love, but know you will have garlic breath after using this!

this is restaurant quality- dressing and croutons are what make it. I skip the anchovies(we don't like) and reduce garlic in dressing for the kids. I put in pan fried chicken strips to make it a main dish.

This was soo easy and very very good.  It makes a lot of dressing fyi.  I used a head and a half of lettuce and it was still swimming a bit in the dressing (I blended it all together).  So depending on how much dressing you like, I suggest you use 1/2 or 3/4 of the dressing - mix together with lettuce and use more from there depending on your liking.  I did not make the croutons - just used store bought.

I added eggs and bacon (most salads are much better with eggs and bacon). To my croutons I also added some parmesan cheese and italian seasoning. Very good!

This rating is only for the dressing. I chopped the anchovies and placed all dressing ingredients into a blender and grind them up. I tasted it and it was really intense!  You only need a little dressing to have a full-flavored salad. I take this dressing to work for lunch. It is much better than the stuff in bottles or at restaurants. Next time, I will try subing the mayo with 1/2 lite sour cream and 1/2 mayo for a lighter version. I will keep all the anchovies!
Thank you for sharing. I feel like a real gourmet cook.

I didn't have the anchovies or anchovy paste so I just left it out, but those who ate it said when they make it you can't taste it either, it just adds the extra dynamic to the sauce.
RAVE reviews when I took this to my sister-in-love's baby shower... I figured, it's Ceasar salad how amazing could this dressing be? And apparently it's AMAZING! Thanks for a Fantastic recipe... also, I used the Garlic Crouton Recipe from this site, and I was told that I can go to visit only if I bring those croutons!

I thought this was very good and quicker than the other caesar salad recipes I've tried.  I will make this again.  I thought it was a little thick, but that is easily solved by adding a bit of yogurt, red wine vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, etc.  Next time I will try adding more dijon mustard and garlic for a little more kick.  But this is a great recipe served with slices of grilled chicken breast for a main course.

Excellent great garlic flavor.  I used store bought garlic croutons & anchovy paste.  I also added more milk to thin the dressing.  It makes a lot of dressing.  Thanks for a wonderful salad, loved it!

I've been using this recipe for Caesar dressing for years. It's perfect. The only change I make is using about 3/4 of a tsp of anchovy paste instead of anchovies. I love these for a Caesar salad wraps--one of our favorite summer meals. Even my 7 year old who hates salad in all its forms enjoys this dressing.

This definitely a 5 star recipe...I only gave it 4 because it was very garlicy!! We LOVE garlic, but this was HOT! I think that I will try it again without using the largest cloves or maybe just use 2 as suggested by others! I used the 1/2 cup mayo and a 1/4 cup of greek yogurt and 2 tsp. of anchovy paste...it was just right! Absolutely delicious! Thank you Karen.

Very garlicky, but very delicious. The anchovies did not add any fishiness, but made the dressing taste authentic.

I just use the dressing from this recipe and it's our favorite. I leave out the anchovies and it's great. We also only use 2 cloves garlic (I shred it using the smallest shredding size on the grater) and that's plenty garlic for us. Maybe shredding it brings out more potency? Anyways - the best. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved the dressing - I skipped the fish & croutons. Keeping extra in fridge for use as a veggie dip too - adding a little lemon juice to thin, as needed.

Very good.  Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't make the croutons.  I also added breaded chicken.  The dressing is delicious.  I was nervous about the anchovies because I'm not a fan, but it turned out great. Very garlicky.  (I love garlic).

This was as good as any restaurant Caesar salad I have ever had. I threw all the dressing ingredients in the food processor and it came out creamy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe and we will be having this a few times this week.

Taste just like a typical restaurant caesar salad. I left out the anchovies on the dressing...not a fan, and it was still great. Guests loved it too!

Wow this sure as garlicky, even with only 3 cloves of garlic. But it sure was good. My husband enjoyed it too. I am going to make up a salad and take it to my nieces on sunday. I will see what the response is. Great recipe.

This recipe was just okay, for me it was too garlicy and too many anchovies. I would consider making it again with less garlic and less anchovies.

I was looking for a caesar salad similar to Macaroni Grill's.  My husband, who is a big fan of their salad, said that this salad was the BEST caesar salad he had ever eaten, even better than Mac Grill!  I used anchovey paste as suggested by other reviewers.  And I did cheat and bought caesar-style croutons to save some time, but the salad was still fantastic!  This salad will go into our regular dinner rotation for sure!  Thanks!

This is the BEST Caesar salad recipe I have ever tried!  I have not been able to find a bottled Caesar dressing that I like, and now I'm very satisfied to make my own!  I didn't add the anchovies and it tasted great!  My hubby loved it too!

This recipe was very good but my one complaint is that there is way too much garlic in it.  I'm a big fan of garlic but the overdose of garlic in this recipe slightly ruined the taste for me because it's all I could taste and even afterwards, I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth.

I omitted the anchovies because neither my husband nor I like them, and I used extra light mayo to make it a bit more healthy.  I think the recipe also calls for more mayo than what is needed but you can just add to the lettuce what you like. 

I've never made my own croutons so it was nice to learn how to and it was super easy & quick. 

I would make this again but use only half the garlic.

Watch the garlic. With the croutons and dressing, it can get heavy.

Great salad, but the dressing came out a bit too spicy. I suspect that it has to do with the dijon mustard, so you might want to use less than instructed and/or eat the salad along with something that would mellow out the spiciness. Otherwise it's a great caesar salad!

Since I wanted to make this a main dish meal and my fiance won't consider anything a main dish unless it has meat in it, I added chicken to this.  I bought a pound and a half of chicken breasts, seasoned it with salt and pepper, cooked it, and then put it in the refrigerator.  When the rest of the meal was done, I sliced the chicken into thin pieces and added it to the salad.  I also removed the anchovies since we don't like them and used reduced fat mayo.  I was pretty generous with the salt and pepper for the croutons as well, but kept everything else the same.  My fiance always likes all the high-rated recipes I get from allrecipes, but it's tough to get really outstanding reviews from him.  This time he actually said it was probably the best salad he's ever had in his whole entire life.  It was obviously a huge hit.

I too, thought it had too much mayo.  I added more of the other stuff, as well.  In addition, I used a different crouton recipe.  But all and all, this was great and it will be a regular in our home!

Made this with Cain's Fat Free Mayo and used shredded Romano cheese - excellent!  I chopped one heart of romaine and added enough dresssing to coat.  Didn't have time to make the croutons, store bought worked great!  Plenty of dressing for 2 to 3 romaine hearts.

I was looking for a ceasar sald dressing withouot raw eggs, and this fit the bill. I added a bit extra parmesan cheese, and since I didn't have anchovies omitted them. Will use this again but still going to try looking at other recipes. Thank you for the recipe - certainly was easy to make!

I have to add my review to the many here. Caesar salad is my favorite, and I have had my own standby for years. I ventured to try this one night for company, and all agree, this tops them all! My friend could not believe it had mayo, as it does not sound appetizing, but this recipe is truly amazing.
I could eat this three times a day for weeks. 

The only thing I add is some red wine vinegar (to taste).

Thank you for this wonderful addition to my recipe box!

This was perfect!  I didn't use anchovies. And although I made the entire batch of sauce and croutons, we didn't need *that* much salad, so I cut down the ingredients accordingly and will use the rest for tomorrow. Don't mix them up ahead of time or the croutons will be mush and the lettuce droopy.

Whoa.  I am never buying caesar dressing again. I totally forgot the Worcestershire, and it was still amazing.  I only had anchovie paste, and used maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of it, and it was perfect.  Scarry to use, but you need it.  I used sliced garlic flavored almonds instead of croutons, and it was absolutely wonderful.

I made this recipe last week at Deer Camp.  The guys raved about it.  Rarely do hunters even consider salads but this one was a real winner!  We went even heavier on the anchovy and it turned out great.  A+

Very good recipe, I did not mix it in the salad because everyone came home at a different time and I did not want to lettuce become wilty, they did it on their own.

I used this recipe for the dressing only. I used store-bought garlic croutons and I also ommitted the anchovies. The dressing was great, really flavorful and strong. (must like garlic!) Although I thought the mayo flavor was too much, so I added more of all the other ingredients to cut down the mayo ratio (U could just cut down the mayo instead a bit) I also topped the salad with lots of fresh shredded parmisian cheese.

Only used 3 anchovies and it was still a little too strong for me and my boyfriend.  Was a nice change though and will make again; probably cutting down on the garlic and anchovies.  Thanks!!

This was an excellent combination.  I left out the anchovies because I don't like the fishy taste and it was excellent.  Good work! :)

Wow, this was the best caesar dressing I've found. I used roasted garlic to cut the bite and thinned it out a bit with olive oil. This is the one! Thanks!!!

This is amazing, even though I accidentally doubled the garlic!  The anchovies--which I love--were overpowering, so I added more mayonnaise and lemon to cut them.  Like other reviewers, I added olive oil to cut the viscosity and am glad that I did.

Even with my garlic flub, everyone loved this salad.  I'm doing it again tonight without the extra garlic, and I'm going to reduce the anchovy significantly and then add more if needed.  I did it in a small food processor, which was great.

The dressing is excellent, and I might even be inspired to say it's the best I've ever prepared at home. I use a different type of crouton, though. Thanks for posting this one!

Outstanding! Anyone who follows this recipe and doesn't like it, doesn't like Caesar Salad.  That being said... :-) I added oil to thin the dressing and almost doubled the croutons. Magnifique!

This salad dressing was unbelievable!!!  I substituted anchoivy paste as suggested by other users, but everything else I followed exactly and it was amazing! I made it for a large party I was having and it was gone in minutes.  I'll definitely be making this again and again and again. :)

I omitted the anchovies (yuck!) and made this a little quicker by using store bought croutons that I fried up in a little butter.  Topped it all off with some freshly grated asiago, and it was absolutely amazing!!!

Not a lot of punch to this. I thought it would be more favorful.  I used fat free mayo and anchovy paste; maybe that was what made it flat.

I'm just rating the dressing -- I'm sure the salad is fine! But the dressing is really good! You just can't buy a good bottled caesar dressing, and ordering it at a restaurant is hit-or-miss. This recipe, however, fit exactly how I want a caesar to taste... garlicky, parmesany, creamy, YUMMY! My only complaint is that it's a tad thick, but tossing it in the lettuce takes care of that problem! Who wants a runny caesar anyway? I mince the garlic, and dice the anchovies and then just throw everything in my magic bullet and blend until smooth! Sometimes I add a little water to make it thinner.

The dressing is fantastic even with reduced fat mayo.  Since I'm vegetarian, I didn't use the anchovies and didn't miss their flavor.  I did add a Tablespoon of olive oil because the dressing is very thick, but the flavor is great.

This was pretty good.  I added a little more lemon because I thought the dressing was a little thick for my tastes - I will make this again!

I used about 1/3 to 1/4 c. of anchovy paste instead.  I made my own garlic croutons and shredded pecorino cheese on top of salad.  Delish.

I have made this recipe many many times and it is wonderful.  I reduce the mayo a little and add some olive oil.  Pepperidge  farm rye and pumpernickel swirl bread make great croutons, as does french baguette with a little olive oil and rubbed with garlic clove after coming out of the broiler.  It is great with grilled marinated chicken, grape/cherry tomatoes and some romano cheese shavings.

Made this salad for New Years Eve.  My guests said it was the BEST ceasar salad they have ever had in their lives!  The homemade croutons were excellent (and easy to make)...I will never buy those hard store bought kind again!!  I'd give this more stars if I could!!!!!!!!!!  YUMMY

Excellent recipe.  I'm not an anchovy fan to begin with, but now that I'm pregnant I couldn't stand the thought of adding them.  It really came out great without the little guys!

My son and husband loved this!  My husband is a Caesar Salad specialist - this definately exceeded expectations.  My son LOVES Briannes brand - and he said this was 10x better.  I only put 2.5 anchovies in... I'm not a big anchovy fan, but agree that it's a definate must for a caesar dressing!!  Thanks, will make again and again!

Sorry to give a low rating, but my family did not care for this dressing. Three cloves of garlic was way too much for our tastes. The croutons were okay but not very flavorful.

A little TOO much anchovie taste for me personally, so be forewarned if you aren't a big anchovie fan.  My boyfriend really liked this recipe, so I'm sure I'll make it again, only with half the anchovies.  Oh...and the homemade croutons work so well.  Yum!

I made this salad for a dinner party I had for my husband's birthday.  It was very easy to make and a huge hit with our guests.  I will definitely make it again!  I probably won't add quite as many anchovies next time simply because I like just a very faint hint of their taste in my caesar dressing.  But overall it was very, very tasty - the croutons were especially delicious!

I made the dressing from this recipe the other night for a meeting, and it was delicious!  If you like a creamy Caesar dressing (like I do), this is a good one.  It's very, very simple.  I blended it all in my mini-prep food processor so it was a breeze.  I only had a chance to make it about an hour or so before I served it, and it was fine.  I didn't do the rest of the recipe.  I used a huge bag of romaine, some Caesar croutons I bought and a bunch of shredded parmesan in the salad.  They ate the entire thing.  My only complaint was that I could have used a little more dressing for the amount of lettuce that I used (but it was a HUGE bag).  Definitely a keeper.

My sister made this the other night - - actually, she made the dressing and bought caesar flavored croutons.  The homemade Caesar salad dressing was absolutely fantastic.  Better than anything in a bottle, that's for sure!  Sorry non-fishy folks, but you MUST have anchovies to make this dressing over-the-top!

This salad is terrific for garlic and anchovy lovers like me. I also added a half dozen grape-sized tomatoes on the side of each salad dish to add a little color and extra zing. I got rave reviews from my dinner guests.  Make sure the parmesan cheese is fresh and not the yucky powdered canned stuff.

Excellent recipe. I recommened placing all of the dressing ingredients exept for the cheese in a blender.  Whip up until combined and creamy, add cheese chill and toss.  It is thick but once you toss with the lettuce it breaks down.  If it is still too thick for your personal taste add a little bit of milk until desired consistency.  It is  a bit too heavy on the garlic so I only use half of the amount.

This was a good recipe, mine came out a little bit too mayo, so I think I would cut that just a tad next time I make it.  But it is nice being able to make it at home! I also used 2.5 tsp of anchovy paste.

This is the best caesar salad I've ever had.  I made it for my father's birthday and EVERYONE loved it.  Just the right amount of tangy flavor. I substituted 2 tsp. anchovy paste for the whole anchovies and it still was delicious!  I will use this recipe often.

I thought the croutons were outstanding and will make them for other salads as well.  My family did not notice the anchovies, but they are essential to the success of the recipe.  I love that there is no raw egg in this recipe.

Great dressing. I used anchovy paste, instead of anchovy fillets. The salad was really good. I saved some extra dressing and used it the next day on more lettuce, my husband thought the dressing tasted even better, and he loved the croutons, although it leaves you with really bad garlic breath!!

Great Ceasar salad recipe.  Husband loves it.  I will not need to buy ceasar dressing from the store again.  I also used anchovy paste as it was what I had.  I used about 1 tsp.  I also addded slightly more lemon juice for thinning.

YUM YUM YUM!  After a I scaled down a few ingredients in this recipe I found it delicious!  I only used 3 anchovies and a little less than 2/4 cups of mayo.  Like others I found it somewhat thick so I added 1/4 cup of water and 2 TBS of Olive Oil. I also added one hard-boiled egg to the mix. I grilled up some lemon pepper chicken and threw in some bacon bits and WHALLA! My fiance went crazy! This recipe is very much recommended!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this recipe "as is" and my entire family loved it.  I didn't think the dressing was too thick - - it coated the lettuce nicely when tossed. As far as the anchovies go, they contribute a lot to the overall flavor and nobody even realized they were in the dressing. I will definately be making this recipe again soon.

Very good! I will definately make this again, it is so much better than store bought bottled dressing; quite easy and worth the work.  I took it to a dinner club party and everyone liked it.  I would cut back very slightly on the garlic (I don't usually say that) and I used the anchovy paste instead of the fillets.  My kids (2 and 4)liked it, but most kids probably wouldn't because of the strong flavor.

This dressing had a good taste, but was extremely thick, I added Olive Oil to make it creamier and less thick.  I will make it again for my family.

This is by far the best home made caesar salad ive had and most definitly better most ive had in restaurants. Its quick, simple and mighty tasty. My mom always use to make the dressing but it was never creamy enough so now im in charge of caeser salad making. I didnt put the anchovies in and it was still top notch. Thanx.

YUMMY!!  I altered the recipe just a bit by serving it as a salad bar type meal with lots of veggies to chose from.  I also served deep fried chicken strips as is done in one of our favorite restaurants.  I baked the croutons because my bread was just not dried out enough to fry it.  Anyway, it was exquisite.  My husband and son ended up eating the chicken strips, croutons and a few of the veggies using the salad dressing as a dip rather than making a salad.  As my husband was munching on leftovers I pointed out to him that he couldn't even get a salad this good in many restaurants.  He said, "Great.  Then we don't have to go out to them anymore."  I believe he missed my point.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The dressing for this salad was so easy and so awesome.  I did use the anchovies, but I added them (and all the other dressing stuff) into my food processor so there wouldn't be pieces of fish.  It was fantastic!  I used boxed croutons but I'll try making them next time too.  Thanks!

I've been looking for a good Caesar dressing and this is it! It has great flavor!  For those who don't like anchoys or are on a low salt diet leaving out the anchoys doesn't ruin the taste.  I made it for a friend of mine on a low salt diet w/o the anchoys and she totally loved it.  If you leave the anchovys out add another clove of garlic for the kick.

Great great recipe.  i ommitted the anchovies but it was still delicious.  the only thing i suggest is adding more lettuce. for teh original serving size of 6, you will be able to fit at least 2 heads of lettuce.  keep in mind that when the dressing is added the salad on a whole appears to shrink

The flavor was unbeatable! I processed it all and it was great. I thought it was a bit too thick so I added more lemon juice and a tablespoon of olive oil to thin it. YUM!

This is absolutely the best Caesar salad dressing I have ever made! The serch is finally over. My husband and I just love this recipe. I used anchovy paste in the dressing and mixed shredded Parmesan cheese with the Romain. It was so delicious. Thanks so much Karen!

You can substitute anchovy paste for the anchovies & the flavor is great. I also used light mayo & it worked well also.

And I left out the anchovies. I had been looking for a creamy Caesar dressing & this is it!!! Even without anchovies. The croutons are great too! It’s a keeper for sure.

I used anchovy paste instead of mincing anchovy fillets. 
I added sweet onions and used sourdough bread to make my croutons.

I'm glad this was easy, and I'm glad my family love it. I'm adding this to my Family Favorites list ??

I've made this twice. Family loved it made as written, but garlic "stayed" with us a long time. I cut the garlic way down the 2nd time and it was still delicious. How much garlic I use in future will depend on what social activities immediately follow

I quadrupled the recipe and made it exactly as described, except omitting salt and pepper, and using my immersive blender to mix the dressing the night before.  I served it for  a book club luncheon and people loved it.  The dressing was indeed a little thick, but I used it without thinning and it tasted great.  Leftovers the next day were still good.

I follow this recipe without modifying it.  This is an excellent dressing, far superior to store bought caesar dressing and in my opinion, tastier than what I've eaten in most restaurants.  It doesn't take  long, it's easy to prepare,  most of the ingredients are already in my refrigerator and most importantly, it's delicious.

I love Caesar dressing but hate when it has a fishy taste. I decided to make this recipe, minus the anchovies, and it was absolutely delicious!  I had all of the ingredients on hand. Now I can’t wait to try the croutons. I just used the ones I had in a bag but I know it will take this salad to the next level having homemade next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this with a few variations.  Full cup of mayo, half cup of grated Parmesan, anchovy paste.  Baked the croutons 5 minutes, drizzled with oil, pressed garlic, salt, and pepper mixture.  Baked another 5 minutes.  BEST CAESAR SALAD EVER!  In fact, best salad of any kind ever.  In contention for best food ever.  Making it yourself lets you experience the real caesar salad!  Oh, and 2 tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice.

I have never made Ceasar Salad in the past, but this was SO good!  I used Giovanni's Anchovy paste instead of the actual fish.  It sounds really nasty, but honestly, it wasn't fishy AT ALL.  I looked online and 1/2 tsp is equal to 2 fish, so I used a teaspoon.  Everyone who loves Ceasar salad loves this recipe and the croutons were excellent as well!  Will definitely be making this more often!

Five stars with a little tweaking. Made it ‘as is’ first time except no anchovies. Found it a little heavy.  Second time around, 1/2 C mayo and 1/4 C good olive oil.  My ‘go to’ recipe from now on.  Also add some shaved Parmesan on top of salad.

I cut the dressing recipe in half so the salad wasn’t too drenched. I also just used store bought croutons to save time.

I have been using this recipe for several years. I make a double or triple batch and keep it on hand. The only changes I have made are increasing the mayonnaise to one cup and the mustard and worcestershire sauce  to 1-1/2 tbsps per batch. I also use shredded Romaine hearts and generally serve it with either grilled and sliced steak or chicken breast.

Great recipe as written. Excatly what you want a caeser salad to be. If dressing is going to sit for a while I'd cut back on Garlic and add a little cream or half and half to thin the dressing a bit.

This was the first time I made Caesar dresssing.  The only change I made was I did not put in any anchovies or salt.   It was delicious.  I will definitely be making again!

Super easy to make! I use this recipe every time  I make Caesar Salad (which is all the time) and everyone LOVES it!  I use mayo with olive oil because it's much lower in fat/calories  than regular mayo and no one can tell the difference!

I was afraid this would turn out tasting either too mayo-ey or too much like anchovies. Nope!! I made this to serve 3, so I added just the tiniest squeeze of anchovy paste. When I followed the directions to a T it ended up tasting a little too much like mayo so I added some more Dijon mustard and minced garlic and it tasted like fresh authentic Caesar dressing!!! I didn’t make my own croutons because my favorite brand is Rothbury Farms—they make the best store-bought croutons. Thank you for such a simple but effective recipe :) Great to have this one under my belt.

Followed the recipe exactly and absolutely loved it. I used a
blender to finish mixing my ingredients. I do wish I could
thin it out just a teeny bit so I could actually pour it , but I don't know how.  This will now be my go to caesar dressing.

I have been making Caesar salad forever but wanted a new recipe that is more consistent (I was still using the coddled egg method). This was spectacular. I made it for the family Christmas Eve dinner (the hostess served beef tenderloin and sautéed green beans) and it got raves.

I have to be the lone voice of dissent here. I always make my Caesar dressing the "real" way: coddled egg, slowly whisked olive oil, etc. Since you're basically making homemade mayo with the other standard ingredients (garlic, parm, Dijon, Worcestershire, anchovy, lemon juice), this seemed an easy way to skip a step. Sorry, didn't like it all. Tasted like Hellman's mayo with add-ins. Was vaguely reminiscent of Caesar, but that was it. Will stick to my old way.

We loved this dressing!  I put all the dressing ingredients in a small food processor to blend them.  I followed the ingredients exactly as listed.  I think I would add a little milk next time, as the dressing is too thick to pour out of the jar.  I didn't have any bread to make the croutons, but had store purchased croutons on hand.  This recipe makes way more dressing than what I used for 2 heads of Romaine.

I don't rate a lot of recipes, just because I usually end up tweaking them one way or another. But I made this one exactly as is (the dressing part) and it is HANDS DOWN the best Caesar dressing I have ever had in my life. I will NEVER use any other recipe. Simply AMAZING! Thank you for sharing!

I’ve made this recipe many times . Definitely our favourite Caesar salad. The only change I made was using anchovy paste instead of filets. Makes no difference in flavour but is more convenient.

Loved it and got rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner. It's the best Caesar I've ever made. If you love creamy, garlicky dressing, this is the one.  
I minced the garlic, then the anchovy filets in a mini processor first, followed by the rest in there. We had it alongside a beef roast. Did almost all as written, except my friend got ahead of me and did the croutons in the oven instead - they were delicious nonetheless.

Although I made a very changes this Cesar dressing was VERY GOOD!! Here is what I did different and I will never buy dressing again!!
1. I only use 1/2 cup mayo and thinned it out with olive oil....without the oil it was to thick to me.
2. I used only one garlic and I made sure to grate it in and then I use a little garlic powder...I don't like the taste of raw garlic.
3. I did not use salt, I found the anchovies and parmesan cheese salty enough. 
4. Make sure you use real anchovies and not anchovy paste. 
5. Enjoy

Great dressing! Used anchovy paste and did not taste fishy at all - was loved by my whole family. The day before I cubed 3/4 of a fresh french baguette and let it sit out overnight to get a bit dried out. The next day I put the bread into a plastic bag that had: olive oil, garlic salt and some italian seasoning. Shook it up and baked @325, flipped them at 10 min, baked another 10 min, & turned up to 350 for the last few minutes - need to watch them @ 350 so they don't get too browned. Awesome croutons! Used fresh shredded parmesan on salad.

This review is for the salad dressing only, as I did not make the croutons. 
This dressing is OUTSTANDING! I followed to a T, even using the anchovies (that I've never used before, and I'll admit...even being a little intimidated by them:) 
I will make this again and again. Company worthy, too! We love grilled chicken on it, for a perfect summer dinner. Thanks,  Karen!

It was amazing! The only thing I would change is how much garlic I put in. It was over powering. 1 clove for the dressing would be what I use next time. Overall, great recipe! :)

Fantastic!  My guests wanted eat two salads before the main course.  I used anchovy past instead of minced fish.  The result was NO one noticed but LOVED the twist.

It was good but way to much garlic and I love garlic. It was so much it burned my throat to eat it. I will try it agin with 2 cloves.

Simple and tastes fantastic.  Add some grilled chicken marinated in a little olive oil and italian seasonings and you have a great light dinner.

Superb recipe! I follow it exactly as written and it tastes delicious. Even kids who claim to be “allergic to salad” have asked for seconds. Each time I make this salad for guests, they can’t stop raving about it and ask for the recipe. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

Excellent Recipe! My family loved this classic Caesar Salad :)
I omitted the bread bc we are low carb, i am sure it is even better with, but i received nothing but praise without it.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed with no changes. It was a huge hit and soooo good. I had no issues with the thicker dressing - tossing it with the salad took care of the problem. Easy enough to make and I’ll be making again!

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it and would suggest doing so; then adjust ithe dressing to your personal taste with respect to garlic and anchovies.  We love it!  I serve it frequently and keep the ingredients on hand for “cravings” that happen when I hadn’t planned to have it.  It is fantastic with lasagna and spaghetti.

It’s was very delicious,  opted out for the anchovies b/c hubby doesn’t like fish. I didn’t make homemade  croutons , just bought the already made one , I tried Cesar croutons and seasoned both taste great . definitely a great staple for a next meal and cookout.

This salad is just amazing! It became my families’ favorite salad and they don’t get tired of eating it. It’s just the perfect combination between crunchy and creamy. The only thing I didn’t add is the anchoas because I think its flavor would pop out to much.

This is my fave Caesar salad dressing ever!  Yes, a little thick, but nothing a little milk or olive oil can’t fix.  I used anchovy paste over anchovies and added an extra clove of garlic.  I’m a garlic lover so letting it sit in the refrigerator over night, even better the next day.  Added a little extra squirt of lemon juice as well.  I wouldn’t change a thing, it’s fantastic!  Great at get togethers, bbq, dinner parties and everyday meal planning. I followed the recipe for croutons, delish!  I used to drizzle olive oil, added spices and baked in the oven.  These are much better, and not so so crunchy.  All in all....the best for me!

I agree with many reviews here - a VERY tasty and traditional Caesar salad dressing, and I love the homemade croutons - the way all Caesars should be serve...mmmmmm!!
I will keep this one as my "go to" - and will maybe add a bit more garlic next time.
5 well earned stars!!

Good caesar dressing. Needs a little more "pop", but a good start. Will definitely use again, maybe try some additional seasonings.

I like to make the exact recipe as written, too then review, but found I couldn't after realizing, I had no anchovies. :(   So, I substitudeted fish sauce and just a tad more worcheshire sauce.  It was AMAZING better then any restaurant hands down!!  I Can only IMAGINE how over the top this will be when I use anchovies!!  Thank you for sharing I will never use another recipe for ceaser dressing!!

Have made this more than a dozen times ... easiest and best approximation to a restaurant Caesar salad and much better than store bought dressings. All the ingredients are important inclusions, especially the Worchestershire.

This is company worthy! Even though it isn't totally authentic- it doesn't call for raw egg yolk, oil, etc....the ready made mayo is just great in my opinion and way easier! My husband says this is his favorite salad and asks me to make it for him a lot. Instead of using 5 anchovies, I just use the whole tin which is about 15 or so.....really yummy!

Made just as written. Exactly. Unbelievable. Best Caesar salad ever. In the rotation!!!! I added chicken breasts, cooked in same pan as bread crumbs, adding a spritz of olive oil. Kept croutons warm in foil, on low. Warm chicken, warm croutons, cold salad.  No one ever raves about temperature variations in one dish, but I am.  This is divine, and it’s hard for a restaurant to give you those wonderful warm and cold. At least I’ve never gotten it!!!!!??

This was good, but the garlic was a little sharp and overwhelming.  My garlic (even though bought that day) had the little green shoots coming out when I peeled it.  Wondering if that was the problem.  Make sure you don't cook the croutons too long.  I did add a little cream after the first serving which made for a better texture and mellowed out the garlic flavor a little bit.  I did use anchovy paste.  I will try again with a fresher garlic and see if that makes a difference.

I didn't use anchovies because they aren't something I keep on hand, plus Worcestershire has anchovies in it so from what I read in other cooking magazines- that's close enough. Some day I might try adding some actual anchovies. I didn't make the croutons- just used store bought, and I added a little milk to make it a little thinner. Definitely better if you let it sit overnight at least. It is amazing. My family's new favorite dressing, and so much better tasting than anything store bought! Plus I like that it doesn't use raw egg, which most "traditional" recipes do. This was fantastic!

Woooooowwwwww. I have had a HARDCORE craving for Caesar salad, and I could not find a place with a decent dressing. I will never, ever again order it from a restaurant because absolutely nothing will compare to the deliciousness that I just stuffed my face with. Followed the dressing recipe to a T and came out sooooo yummy. I always make a homemade mayo which probably took it to another level as well. Don't pass this one up! Or do if you still want to enjoy restaurant salads ;). Enjoy!

We love this dressing and I can usually make three or more salads from the one batch. Don't skip the homemade croutons because they really do make the salad!

Easy, delicious Caeser salad recipe. Generally works great as written. Especially if you are serving right away. I did cut with some half and half and added other stuff but mainly because I let the dressing sit for several hours in the fridge before serving. 

If you are going to let it sit I would cut the garlic to one clove otherwise it may be too potent for some.

This recipe for Caesar salad tastes like you get in a nice restaurant. I left out the anchovies and pressed the garlic rather than minced it. It was slightly too thick so, just before serving it, I added a little milk. I will make this again. 
Update: The second time I made it, I used a little more milk and less mustard. SUPER!

I made this according to the recipe but found the taste of mayonnaise detracted from the dressing.  If you like mayonnaise, you'll probably like this.  If not, probably find another recipe.

The dressing was amazing! I did not saute the garlic as instructed and used store bought croutons but other than that I followed the directions and it was delicious! I received many compliments from the crew I was feeding.

Awesome!   Did not need much dressing to cover the lettuce, use less than you think then mix, you can always add more.  Croutons were awesome wont buy them any more!  Made per recipe except I used anchovy paste and vegan mayo.  I will make again...tonight!

Just pulled this together as I was craving Caesar salad. Had all ingredients except Dijon mustard on hand.  Tasted pretty relish despite no mustard. Had croutons in pantry, for yummy dinner salad later tonight. Left to percolate for a few hours in fridge. Yup, a keeper.

Strong recipe and thankful that most everything called for are kitchen staples.  Felt it was a little light on the lemon flavour for my taste so rather than add more juice I added some lemon zest.

Yum! I have made this with and without home made croutons. Also I don’t use anchovies. The dressing is absolutely delicious. This salad is great with either Romaine or baby Kale. It has become a favourite!

I forgot to purchase the anchovies at the store and made the recipe exactly as listed except without the anchovies and it was still amazing.  Husband requested I make it frequently.

This dressing is so good! I made a huge bowl of salad for a Bbq and it all got eaten.  I had never used anchovies before so I wasn't sure if they should be in oil or water and how many were in a can... I bought two cans, in oil and that was great for making 4 times the recipe even though there were only 3 in each can.  The recipe as is makes enough dressing for multiple heads of romaine lettuce.  I threw the garlic cloves and anchovies in the food processor to save the chopping and it worked great. Thanks for a great recipe and helpful comments!

This is a new family favorite!  Easy to make and tasty to boot! I follow the receipt down to the letter, except I buy croutons, so I don't need the oil and bread.  We have also added grilled chicken for the meat carvers in our family.

Outstanding!!!!!  The second time I made it, I used only 1/2 cup of mayo and added some olive oil to thin it out a bit.  Thank you for sharing; this went into my ALL STAR folder!!

Really good! I live in a country where they don't really "get" Caesar salad. You can find it in some restaurants, but it doesn't taste right.  This dressing is spot-on if you crave North American style Caesar salad. People - use the anchovies. They are the "umami", and don't taste like fish.  Very few ingredients impart umami - anchovies are one of the best.  I put all ingredients in my food processor and kept pulsing until smooth.

I didn't  have anchovies, but thought it would be okay without them.  Well. holy underestimations!!  Amazingly delicious recipe, even without anchovies.  Handy for us, because we are vegans,  Yes, I know.  There's a story there, mostly being the fact that we had a few fish/fish based items around that we never got around to giving away when we switched from being long time vegetarians to vegans.  Too cheap and wasteful to just toss food someone else might enjoy.  So that's how vegans could possibly end up with old, very old anchovies.  Ditto the parmesan, though me may never give it up.  :-)

Also used Fresh Gourmet brand of organic Caesar premium croutons.  Sauteed them in the garlic oil, just as if they were day old bread croutons.

Absolutely best Caesar salad we've ever had.  Manners went down the tubes, we were stuffing our mouths and simultaneously saying the obvious things like "oh my gosh!"  "good heavens this is incredible",  etc. etc. 

Cannot recommend this recipe any more whole-heartedly.

I loved this! I stayed away from making Caesar dressing before because of the raw eggs. This dressing is so good and has no eggs! I can now make it at home and I'm so happy! My croutons were a little on the overdone side but still delicious. Great recipe, thanks!

Good, very garlicky.  Croutons were great.  However I didn't like the amount of mayo that went into it. Found another recipe that substitutes much of the mayo with yoghurt and it tastes much fresher that way.

This recipe was a hit! I made it exactly as the recipe said, and the flavor was great.  The only change I would make would be the croutons. I would definitely use a different recipe. I liked the flavor of the croutons, but I ended up throwing them in the oven for a little to get a better crunch.

DELICIOUS!
I used about half the anchovies that the recipe called for.  That was personal preference, but this recipe is delicious.  I made extra to keep so we could make caesar salads all week long.

This rating is based on the exact recipe as written. As is, it is a little chunky for my taste, but the flavor is wonderful. I modified it as others have by using a food processor to blend all the ingredients and also by thinning it out with a little milk. With that modification it's 5 stars!

I have made this about 10 times.  Anchovies gross me out, but I bought the paste.  My husband gets all excited when I announce whats for dinner.  The only other change I made was that I always have home made garlic butter in my frig.  So I make the crouton by slicing the bread and spread it with the home made garlic butter cut it into croutons and cook it in the skillet.  Also, sometimes I make shrimp and the hub tosses that into the salad.  This is a great recipe.

Great salad!  I made the dressing as stated but had to tweak it for our tastes.  My husband loved the salad but the dressing was just a little pungent for me in the recipe, so I will adjust next time.  It was very garlicy as is, and I love garlic!  I will adjust by only using 2 cloves of garlic, reduce the anchovies by half, and double or triple the lemon juice.  I also added dill and pureed it all together with a little milk until smooth.   Overall it was very yummy!  I added in some chopped tomatoes to the salad and didn't use all the oil for the croutons, to make it lighter.  Thank you for the recipe!

The recipe is simple and works well. The only thing I found was the amount of garlic. I recommend starting with a 1/3 of what the recipe asks for then add more to taste after. It was too strong for me but you garlic addicts will love it.

I've made this recipe a few times and absolutely love it. It's easy to prepare and will make your tastebuds sing. It's even better the second day, IF you have any leftover. I love anchovies, so always add extra.

I made it for a dinner party and it was a hit for all who like Caesar Salad. I loved it too. My only deviation was to buy some deli-made croutons and it was so good!

Reading some of the reviews first would have helped a little in making the dressing, but overall it's excellent as is. Restaurant quality

This is my go to for Caesar dressing and I make no changes. It never disappoints. I usually double it because the ratio works out with the anchovies I get.

Hands down the best Caesar dressing I've ever made!! I only had anchovy paste on hand, so I used about a tablespoon of that (we love anchovies).

I just made this recipe for the third time in less than two weeks.  I made it for a large gathering (15 people) and for just the 2 of us.  

Must admit that I didn't add the anchovies, and I didn't make my own croutons. 

Delicious!!!

Great recipe! I did make a couple of changes for our tastes.
More Worcestershire (doubled), 2 Tb of white wine  vinegar, and a dash or two of cayenne pepper.
It was fantastic! Now I have to double recipe because we love it so much.

I made two batches of this today for Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe exactly as written for one batch; for the other, I omitted the anchovies. Honestly, I could hardly tell the difference between the two. It was a crowd pleaser. It's definitely a keeper. Thanks to the person who developed this. Super yummo! :-)

For dressing only - to die for and very, very authentic.  No additional salt needed with anchovies IMHO.  I did not make the croutons.

I never cared for Caesar salad having had it only in restaurants. Hubby liked it so I decided to try this dressing and make him one. He loved it and so did I! It was easy to make. I mixed it up in the bowl as stated in the instructions and let it sit an hour or so until I needed it. The flavor was wonderful. I love garlic but don't do well with raw garlic which this contained and getting a minced piece on my tongue left a strong garlic aftertaste which bothered me a little.  Still, this is a very delicious dressing.

This recipe has ruined me for eating Caesar salads out of my house--none taste as good as homemade. I make this salad 1-2 times a month. I get asked to bring it to holiday dinners as well. The only thing I don't do is add salt since the anchovies are salty enough for me. Other than that, no changes are needed. It makes a great, tasty, addictive salad.

I decided to follow this recipe exactly "as is" and it was a hit at a recent potluck dinner. The recipes suggests you may need extra lemon for taste, I ended up using about 2 T of lemon juice to add a little more acidity. Great recipe if you're looking for a crowd pleaser!

I made this for my daughter's high school event and the students said it was a amazing!  Dressing: I added 2 tablespoons of olive oil to thin; and doubled the lemon juice. I did not add cheese to keep it lighter; and left out the anchovies, salt, and pepper.  I used a blender as others recommended. Refrigeration is key - I made in the morning for an evening event.  I used Chef John's  Homemade Croutons recipe - leaving out the cheese., paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.  Add the dressing a little a time until the lettuce is covered; too much weighs it down to a noticeable "deflate".  Use  any left over dressing on other greens!  Tonight, my daughter made "garlic bread" with the left over dressing - she toasted the left over French bread baguette , "buttered" it with dressing, and sprinkled it with left over Parmesan cheese - Yum!  FYI - given it was an outside event, I avoided a raw egg as others mentioned adding.  Thanks Karen for taking the time to submit!

this was absolutely delicious. I followed it to the letter and it was fantastic. If you didn't like it because you changed it, try making it the way Karen wrote it. We used it as a dip as well as a salad dressing. This is a keeper!!

I added baked chicken breasts, spiced up a bit. And I didn't remove the garlic from the pan when I heated up the bread. Result was awesome!!

This recipe is the best! I make it just as it says to and its a perfect strong Caesar dressing. I mince the garlic and anchovies in my mini food processor to chop it super fine.
I get requests for this dressing ALL THE TIME!

This is a great Ceasar dressing recipe without the traditional raw egg, which can be a health risk if you don't have straight from the chicken eggs on hand, which I didn't. I also didn't have canned anchovies so had to use paste.  A pity, maybe next time.  As mentioned the paste lacks oil so this meant the dressing was a bit thick, which I thinned with extra fresh squeezed lemon juice as I like tangy dressing.
For the croutons,  I used pumpernickel bread, shaking them in a bag to coat with Italian spices and a combo of olive oil and melted butter. I baked them 20 minutes in a 350 oven. Half way through, I tasted  for flavor and instantly regretted the olive oil. If you don't have health issues, all butter is better. I added more butter and saved the croutons from mediocracy. They ate like chips!  
I love that there is no bacon in this recipe - who needs it - but did add a few very fresh sliced white mushrooms and freshly grated Parmeson. This recipe is a keeper and puts most restaurant Ceasar salads to shame! I served it with grilled  wild tuna steaks.  YUM!

This was really good, but then I love anchovies.  I did cheat and use store-bought garlic/cheese croutons.

Full disclosure...I only made the dressing, not the croutons.

Like other reviewers, I found folks who actually followed the recipe and I did as well, which resulted in a great new family favorite.  My husband loves anchovies and I don't...but I found that chopping them finely really added flavor without that salty, overwhelming anchovy taste that I usually don't go for. The mayonnaise was just the right amount.  Don't skip the lemon juice either. Yum!

I'd maybe cut down on the salt a little next time; it's already salty from the anchovies.  

I made a double batch, since there were 10 anchovy fillets in the tin and I didn't know what else I'd do with them.  Very tasty dressing.

Great dressing very creamy and tasty. Will make regularly. I substituted Greek yogurt for about 1/4 of the 3/4 mayonnaise.

I have made this a couple of times and it is always a hit. I make extra so I have some for a later date.   it keeps well.   I use light mayo to cut back on calories and I use anchovy paste. I usually don't make any croutons, I just buy them.  It is such an easy salad dressing to make and is delicious.

In the past I have spent so much money on my favorite bottles of Caesar dressing but never again! I have tried a few recipes before and even improvised but couldn't find the right ratio of everything. This recipe however tastes more like my favorite triangular bottle of dressing than any other recipe I've tried. I didn't change anything except I used anchovy past (approx 1 1/2 tsp). I threw some chicken on my salad and it was amazing, I will never buy Caesar again. AWESOME, thank you so much!

This was my first time trying anchovies so I was a bit concerned but I couldn't even taste them. A great way to reap the nutritional benefits without the taste. Need to thicken with half and half but it was superb, thanks!

It was a delicious appetizer before a dinner of crispy chicken or soft meat. I did make some changes as the mustard or anchovies were not needed because I am not a fan of grainy or hot foods. Without these ingredients, it's delicious!

This dressing is easy to make when you want a creamy Caesar salad.  A nice alternative to the vinaigrette version.  Grating the garlic on a rasp helps to free the juices.  The resulting paste blends easily into the dressing  without garlicky lumps.  Thanks for posting this one!

This is my favorite Caesar Salad recipe! I don't eat bread so I skip making the croutons, and just add 4 cloves to the dressing. I also double the fresh parmesan. So creamy and delicious!

Easy to make and produces a tasty salad. Shy away from traditional Caesar dressing using raw egg yolk so this is a perfect alternative. I do think it is too thick so I added a bit of half and half to get to the proper consistency.

Excellent!  I have made this salad many times, following recipe exactly, and we love it.  The dressing is creamy and tasty, but the croutons are the BEST!  I make the croutons on their own, and we eat them like chips.  Yummy!

I made it into a shrimp ceasar salad, it was awesome! I sautéed the shrimp in some olive oil, butter , garlic and a little lemon juice. The dressing I made by the recipe, it was delish!!!!

Terrific! This is the same salad I eat at the restaurant. I followed everything to a T and it was perfect. I put slices of chicken breast...I won't definitely buy the bottle sauce!
Thank you so much!!!

We only made the dressing which turned out perfect! We threw everything but the mayo into a small food processor then once that was done, added it to the mayo and let it chill in the fridge while we prepared the rest of the salad.  Definitely use real anchovies not paste.

I found the dressong far too potent for my tastes. The dijon mustard was overpowering and the dressing was much thicker than I want on a ceasar salad. I added olive oir & water to thin is down but still didn't care for it. Sorry I won't be making this again

Absolutely fantastic - only things I did differently were to use anchovy paste instead, and store bought croutons the second time I made this.  Printed it so I had it in my box Apr 1/16.

Yum! I have made this several times and often add grilled chicken to the salad. My husband turns his nose up whenever I add anchovies to the shopping trolley, but he loves this salad. I have to reassure him each time that he likes what I make with them.

This dressing is amazing!  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used regular mustard.  It was a little thick so I blended in some milk and it was the perfect consistency.   I opt out the anchovies only because I don't care for them.  Otherwise, dressing was amazing!  I definitely plan to use this dressing regularly! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Pretty darn good.  I have to laugh as it seems almost every review is for their own individual recipe.  Why not just post their recipe instead of reviewing it under yours.  Looks like most have not tried this recipe.

Seriously delicious and I made it without altering any of the ingredients.  The only change I made was to mash the garlic and anchovies for the dressing in a mortar and pestle and this was great because the paste just made the dressing that much creamier.  This is definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe at first without the anchovies and lemon juice... it tasted off. Added 1-2 tsp of anchovy paste with the lemon juice and it was on point. Honestly extremely good caesar dressing!!!!

I made this tonight.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  My garlic cloves were huge...a plus in my book.   I made the batch.  I added a bit more lemon juice and an extra anchovy or two.  My take on a good Caesar is that it should be "fishy delicious."  Everyone loved it and I thought it was easy to prepare using my mini food processor to mince the garlic and grate my shredded Parmesan.  I tossed an extra tablespoon or two of shredded Parmesan in to the final salad with the croutons.  Perfect.

GOOD  I followed dressing exactly.  Except,,I put a little to much anchovy paste in. Not sure how much 5 anchovies 
would be so I put in more paste than usual. Maybe a little to much. A little salty, but full  of flavor and I still loved it. I also added a little cream to thin a bit.
Definitely will make again.

I used just the dressing part of this recipe (well, I guess I used the romaine, too!)  Delicious!  My garlic cloves were large, so mine came out very garlicky.   I blended everything in my mini-food processor, and used fresh grated parmesan.  Really thick, creamy, flavorful dressing.  It's not really pourable, but it does;t have to be to toss it with a salad; I might thin it out with a bit more lemon juice and some olive oil, but this is seriously good just the way it's written.

I tested this recipe last night and devoured the extra with crackers!  I made a double batch just now to take tomorrow on a girl's weekend.  I only cut back on the anchovies a bit and made it in a food processor so it's a nice texture.  I'll bring extra shaved parmigiana.  And Mrs. Cubbison's classic croutons - sorry.

being dairy and egg-free, i omitted the cheese and used veganaise in place of mayonaise.  it was still very delicious.   i also amped up the croutons by using leftover bacon grease to toast the bread.   i put this dressing up against a store bought Caesar and my guests loved the homemade one better!!

Used the recipe for dressing over a wedge of romaine. Skipped the croutons. Dressing was probably the best I've ever had.

Very very tasty! 
I was a little weary using the  anchovy filets but definitely a must!
It was a tad salty so I did add a small amount of whipping cream to help tone it down a bit.

The second time I made this, I decreased  the anchovies to 3 and  garlic to 2 cloves and it was perfect with 2 heads of romaine hearts.  Awesome recipe if you want to impress your dinner guests.

Simple and quick to make.  I used a fresh baguette and sliced it into 1" x 1" x 1/2" cubes letting them dry for about an hour before browning.  I prefer white anchovies and extra virgin olive oil to thin the dressing to a little more to my liking.

Among family and friends I am famous for my salads. This is one of them! I make the dressing as written and for the salad I use Trader Joe's curly kale, dried cherries, and I make croutons from multigrain bread. Family begs for this regularly.

I slice my Parmesan with a vegetable peeler and this seems tastier than shredded Parmesan.  This seems to make the texture better.  Got the idea from the way they serve  it some of the restaurants I've eaten in.

I was looking for an authentic restaurant style Caesar dressing and this was it! I wanted to really taste the anchovies so I bought whole filets in a jar and minced them up very fine. I added just a touch of olive oil to smooth it out a bit more at the end. Other than that it was perfect!

I have been using this recipe as is for years.  Do not change a thing!!!!  Perfect for salad and I like it also with fish sticks and side sauce for some fresh fish.  Make it the day before so all the tastes can join together.

I often eat Caesar Salad when I go out to eat. This is much better!

Made the dressing. Threw in all ingredients into a small chopper and it was so good. I could just lick the dressing as I love anchovies. This is as good as the restaurant.

Amazing!!!! My whole family loved it! Except, we don't like anchovies or mustard, so we kind of skipped that part... but my family says it's the best Caesar Salad they've ever had... and we've had too many to count ;D

Excellent recipe as is....I've used croutons from the store and it was still fantastic.
Edit to add:
I've made this numerous time now with no changes and if you haven't made it...you're missing out.

This dressing is amazing.  I also followed it to the letter - including the anchovy's.  Wow!!!  Wish I would have had time to bake the fresh croutons.  If they are half a good as the Ceasar I can only imagine ...  I used one head of romaine and still have enough for two more salads.

This was delicious! Didn't have Dijon so I used honey mustard. No need to add extra salt; the anchovies make it salty enough. I just bought good Caesar croutons instead of making them.

Oh, wow! This is phenomenal! I can't say I followed exactly but only because I tend to not really measure when I cook. Other than that, I used all of the same ingredients (including anchovies which I've never done before). It was easy and delicious! I've also never reviewed any recipe on here but had to write a review for this one because it is just that good!

I blended this for a smooth texture. I didn't have enough mayo so I substituted light sour cream and a little brine from a caper jar. I probably could have added a bit of sweetener, but it was fine. Warning: very garlicky. I like that, but adjust amount if you don't.

OH MY GOODNESS!! I have always liked Ceasar salad and became a huge snob after working in a fine dining restaurant for years, which, in my humble opinion, made the BEST Ceasar dressing I had ever tasted, and compared all others to that place.  After making this today, I have to wonder....is this where he got the recipe from? Ha! I followed it to the letter and it was perfect! Thank you so much for sharing this... it's fun to know that I now hold a recipe to a fantastic Ceasar dressing :)

Everyone loved this! Followed it to a "T". The only recommendation is to really make sure the anchovies are pasty. I pushed mine through my garlic press ten mushed them with a spoon. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for.  I always try to do that the first time I make someone else' recipe. If I need to change something for some reason I do it after I taste the original.  Well I tell ya, this won't have any changes, including the anchovies that hubby strongly thought he disliked. Excellent and is restaurant quality, we will be using it on a regular basis.  Thanks for an excellent recipe Karen.

A success! I was nervous about using anchovies for the first time. Totally didn't give off any fishy taste and was definitely needed to add that extra saltiness you can sense in homemade Caesar dressings. I made sure to mince them up good in the blender with the other ingredients- I think this is key as no one wants anchovy chunks in their dressing. I didn't have Worcestershire so used steak sauce instead. Also used another's suggestion to "shake and bake" the croutons- put in ziplock baggie with EVOO and any other spices and seasonings you enjoy- rosemary is a delight!

Made using ingredients exactly as listed. Instead of mincing garlic and anchovies, I ground them into a paste using mortar and pestle then combined all ingredients as directed. This dressing tastes absolutely the way I like it! And it's so simple! Would recommend this recipe over ANY bottled Caesar. Delicious!

There is one variation I use for this exact same recipe, and that is, use a large egg in place of the mayonnaise and more importantly, use the oil that the anchovies are canned in.  Really excellent recipe, will impress everyone who loves a great Caesar salad!

This recipe is very similar to the recipe my hubby has been using for years. He tried this one last night, and we both enjoyed it. We used 1.5 tsp of anchovy paste instead of the anchovies just because it was easier at the time and we added 1/4 tsp of Tabasco. Tasted great!

Made as written except I doubled the dressing to use up the anchovies. We all liked this dressing very much and will make it again.

I used real anchovies.  I was so scared!  But it was a success.  I did use hellman's light mayo.  I don't know why someone would say this is "okay".  All of the flavors are there.  It was good.

This is the best Caesar Salad I've ever tasted.  I omitted the anchovies and purchased Caesar croutons.  Not making the bread cubes omitted 3 cloves of garlic.  Otherwise, this recipe is delicious!

Best Caesar dressing I've ever had. This one had me using a piece of bread to mop up every bit of dressing from the plate.  I made it exactly as specified (including the anchovies)but I put everything other than the parmesan cheese in the blender to create a homogenous mixture then added the parmesan cheese for texture. Received many compliments on this dressing.

Wow!  I haven't reviewed anything on Allrecipes in such a long time, but THIS had to get a nod.  We used anchovy paste (because we had it on hand). I usually just skip the anchovy part to the Caesar salad but hubby went ahead and added it without my knowledge.  Wow. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I omitted the anchovies and it was good, but is it supposed to be so thick?  I added some olive oil and it was still thick.  But tasted goos.

This is a very simple and quick recipe with excellent results. I followed the recipe but to suite my taste, I added an extra clove of garlic. I didn't have anchovies so I used anchovy paste which worked just as well. The flavor of the dressing is perfect, although a bit thick in texture it's perfect for tossing the salad.

Wow, this was a really good dressing except for I didn´t put anchovies and with just 2 cloves of garlic it had already a lot of bite. I also went a little heavier with the cheese. I will be repeating this! Thank you for posting!

Delicious dressing.  Made it exactly as written and found it to be way to thick.  Watered it down to perfect consistency.  Will definitely make again.

I did not change a thing.  Thought it was really good.  I am use to the more traditional cesar salad with olive oil, coddled egg etc but this was a nice change.  I also love anchovies, always have to eat a few right out of the can.

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday because she requested Caesar salad. I made it with the homemade crouton recipe also on this website. She said it was the best Caesar salad she had ever eaten. I made it as directed but I halved the anchovies because I really am not a big fish eater and can honestly say I don't think I have ever eaten an anchovy before. I  think I used too much garlic because it had a very strong garlic flavor.  This dressing was really thick so I tried to dilute it with a little milk but it only helped a little. I will try to make it again but without the anchovies and a bit less garlic.

I've never made Caesar dressing before but this tasted awesome. The only thing is that I doubled the Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard for a little bit more of a kick and I think it tastes perfect. It's my new favorite dressing and my husband is addicted to it too. Thanks for the great and super easy recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly with one exception: I triple the recipe and use the entire 2 oz can of anchovies... including the oil. We use a mix of romaine, iceburg, spinach, kale and other greens, and top it with grilled chicken breast. Leftover dressing refrigerates well for about a week. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!

my wife and I love ceasar salad.  This was the first time I have tried making the dressing from scratch.  It is awesome.  I felt like it was liquid gold and was trying to get every drop out of the blender so nothing was wasted.  I had that frenzied feeling like this dressing was so good I was going to lose my humanity.  Okay i am exaggerating a little, but I really LOVE this dressing.

Very good - a little spicy though?  Not sure why.  The anchovies were difficult to deal with - I guess I lack experience with that but next time I'll use the paste as I have in other recipes - much easier and cleaner!  I agree with another reviewer who said the dressing was a little too thick.  I too thinned it our with cream but it still was thicker than I would have liked - I just didn't want to drown out the taste.  Still - excellent flavor!  I served it a gathering and had nothing but a few pieces of lettuce left and I had used 2 heads of lettuce!

One of the best recipes I've tried. I replaced the anchovies with grilled chicken. Other than that it's perfect.

Outstanding.  A huge hit with my family on Christmas.  Followed recipe almost exactly (omitted salt as others suggested, used anchovy paste).  Absolutely must sit overnight for flavors to mingle.  Also, be warned, a little goes a long way.  Don't dump all the dressing on your romaine.  Pour some on, mix, assess.  Fantastic!

Very yummy....even with the anchovies! Very simple to make. I followed the recipe, with one exception: I pureed the ingredients with about 1/4 cup of milk. Next time I will bake the croutons with a little olive oil brushed on them and some seasonings. These ones were somewhat greasy and softened too quickly in the salad. It topped off my menu of Prime Rib Au Jus with Yorkshire Pudding, Make-ahead Mashed Potatoes (both recipes from this site), and mixed vegetables! It was the most delicious meal I had in a long time! (Caramel Apple Pie for dessert!)

The dressing was the BEST ever-even better than ones I had in restaurants-I forgot to take a photo because it was going so fast at Christmas, meaning this salad was being eaten up so fast!  I had to get mine fast to get any-did everything just like the recipe (but no anchovies, sorry) said-croutons and all, and I will make this over and over again now-the best!  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was a really great recipient. I don't think you need as much mayo as the recipe calls for. Next time I'm going to make it with 1/2 cup of mayo.

This was fantastic. I blended all of the dressing ingredients in a food processor, and add a couple of extra cloves of garlic. I also added a touch of red wine vinegar. I made the dressing a day ahead so that the flavours would have more time to blend. The croutons were so yummy and easy too! The second time I made them, I added some Italian seasoning after cooking them. They were delicious both ways! Just make sure that you're super careful not to burn the garlic when you're making the garlic oil or else you'll ruin the taste.  My fiancée loves this salad and told me that I should make it all of the time. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This dressing has the "stand out" feature that I was looking for. It is simply delicious. I've just tasted it off the spoon so far, not on the salad and I'm concerned that it is a tad thick. I'm considering adding a tablespoon of milk to make it more pourable. But the flavor is awesome. Come to think of it, it tastes somewhat like bleu cheese.

I usually dislike reviews with changes made to the recipe, especially when the review is negative. But, I don't eat anchovies so I left them out. Just threw in a little hot sauce for some spice... and voila! Delicious.

I made it for a potluck and it was well received.  Next time I might try fewer anchovies; I like a milder flavor.  I like a good Caesar salad.  Would definitely make this again.  Very easy.

To me, just as good as my original recipe that consisted of egg whites & dry mustard seasoning....but easier. I used 4 minced cloves of garlic instead of 6. Also added olive oil to the seasoning to thin the dressing a bit. I like a bit more bite, so I added extra lemon & worcestershire sauce as well. Very good!

I was looking for a new recipe that my son would love.  Everyone in the family really liked it, even more than my own recipe.    The dressing is really balanced and tasted a lot like fine restaurant's ceasar sald dressing.  It is now my go to recipe.

I followed the recipe for the dressing exactly - EVERYONE LOVES IT! I do use my own method for making croutons - cut bread cubes, toss in bowl with salt & pepper and enough olive oil to barely moisten -bake at 350 degrees for about 10 mins on a baking sheet until golden brown.

I LOVED the flavor of the dressing. That said, as I was merrily adding it to the lettuce, I used it all and it turned out so goopy that it pretty much ruined it. Next time I make it (and I will make it again) I will cut the dressing recipe WAY back so it just adds the flavor to the lettuce and doesn't saturate it.

Did not add anchovies and still fell in love with this salad, even my grandchildren ages 12, 9 and 3 loved it.

Wow! I can see why there are so many positive ratings. I just tried this Caesar dressing and it is great. My husband loved it. I followed suit with several other reviewers and added about 2 tablespoons of whole milk and a tablespoon of red wine. Also doubled the garlic in the dressing and the infused oil. I even sprinkled the crispy little pieces of garlic from the oil over the salad. No garlic ever goes to waste at our house. One of the things I like best about the dressing is no fresh eggs are involved.

Have been using this for years with two changes. Combine oil with mayo and leave out lemon juice. Blend dressing with half of cheese and equal bacon bits. Add extra bacon to salad if desired.

Go-to salad recipe.  I have it memorized.  Amazing thick, rich full-flavored dressing.  Do not skimp on any ingredients, follow the recipe (one can of anchovies has about 3 salads worth of materials) and you will definitely have your socks knocked off with the flavor.

It was a little too thick. I would use a little olive oil and more lemon juice next time. I would also use a few more anchovies. The croutons were very good.

My family loves this and I too follow it to the tea. Using canned anchovies, loads of garlic all organic ingredients, my family can't get enough. I started off just doing 1/2 a batch and now it goes so fast I've turned to doing a full batch! I can't keep enough romaine in the house!  I've tired other recipes and this one is the only one in my menu folder now!  I must say I do add soy creamer to the batch to make it a bit more runny. Go ahead try it!

i love this recipe so much, I make it almost every week! I have never liked caesar salad but this is so awesome and I especially never liked croutons, always found them to be like rocks but these croutons are soft and so good, my 3 year old usually has 3 helpings of salad. Thanks so much for this recipe :)

I just made this recipe and its a perfect creamy dressing.  I read other reviews of people having trouble mixing, I mixed by hand with no trouble however I added more lemon juice as we like it that way (not because the recipe isn't perfect).  It divine!

I wasn't making a traditional Caesar salad but just wanted a change of pace from my usual salad dressing.  Excellent recipe, I skipped the anchovy fillets and it was a nice garlicky dressing.  My only caveat is that it came out so thick that it's hard to spread on all the salad. Next time I'll toss everything in a large bowl to evenly coat the salad and then plate it.

Awesome, awesome, awesome Caesar dressing recipe. The BEST! I use Anchovy paste instead of having to dice anchovies and love it. This has been a huge hit at every event and I've shared the recipe countless times.

Love, love, love this recipe.  It turned out wonderful.  I followed it to a tee, except half it.  I never could find a decent store bought ceasar dressing, so I decided to take a stab at making my own and I'm glad I did.  This recipe is great.

I read the reviews and decided to try this recipe ... amazing. I added 1 extra garlic clove.  I used my magic bullet to mix the all the ingredients (except the mayo). Then I folded in the mayo at the end.  Put the mixture in the refrigerator until I needed it.

Amazing dressing!! I followed the recipe exactly and this was an incredible Caesar. Perhaps the best I've ever had. I made enough to have extras and on the second day I poured in (very slowly and while stirring vigorously) some olive oil. That put it over the top! Anyone need a good Caesar dressing? This is it! 5 stars!

This was fantastic.  I must say that I was searching for a dressing recipe that most fit my memory of making Caesar, and this one was it.  I have never used mayonnaise, and still didn't, but otherwise everything was right on!  I never was a creamy Caesar person, which I guess the mayo makes it, so that's probably great, too.  I did use a coddled egg.  Didn't rate this to show my changes, rated it to thank you for getting me this far.  Loved it!

I read through a lot of these reviews. Alot of people added oil,& if you read through the recipe, it doesnt tell you to add oil. I find the dressing to be way to thick,& suggest to wait to salt & pepper til after you use the food processer, & chill( the anchovies will give a salty taste, & dijon has the pepper & when its in fridge it developes more). I will say some people added half the mayo and used buttermilk, others did add oil to thin the consistancy. I loved the anchovies, just rince them off good. Also definetely toss the salad with dressing before serving because of the thickness, otherwise I would tell you to have a plan on thinning it. Tt was very good though..It just needs minor changes to your taste buds.

Needed some caesar dressing and didn't have time to run to the store, so I went looking for a recipe, and this one sounded perfect! I added one extra garlic clove, and I didn't have mustard or worcestershire, so I substituted 2 Tbsp. sour cream. I used two giant anchovy fillets, and that was enough. Turned out great!!

Wonderful!!!!  I made for my son's 12th birthday along w/ baked spaghetti!  My 9 year old couldn't get enough!  I used anchovy paste, light mayo and jarred diced garlic! Yummy, yummy!!!!   Just as good as any caesar that you will get at a restaurant.. No.. it's better!  Because YOU make it!!!  Enjoy this one!  Thanks so much for posting!

This salad is indeed SUPREME! But the first time I made the dressing I used fresh garlic (and perhaps too much) and it was too spicy for my "sissy husband"(his words, not mine). I liked the basic taste so much that I made it again the next day, using minced garlic in a jar, and it was FANTASTIC! The reason might be that you get an accurate measurement - 3 cloves = 1 1/2 teaspoon, rather than just guessing that your 3 cloves (of fresh) are the size the recipe intended). Thanks, Karen, for a wonderful recipe that we'll enjoy often

I just made the dressing from this recipe last night and OMG it tastes super delicious! i made a double batch. I no longer have to go to a local restaurant in my town and pay $10 for a small container of their homemade dressing. This one is definently a keeper!

loved it! been looking for a good caesar salad dressing for a long time and this is it! I only had anchovy paste so I used that instead of the anchovies and thined it out with fat free half and half because it's really thick. Thanks Karen, for sumitting your recipe. Elvira Silva.

Really yummy! SO much better than bottled dressing. We may never go back. It was so fresh and tasty...I'm looking forward to my leftovers for lunch today! The only changes I made was using light mayo and anchovy paste. And to save time i just used store bought croutons, though i'd like to try that part of this recipe too! I served it with grilled steak on top. Yum!

This was really good.  Almost like the real thing. The only change it needed was some cream and a little extra lemon to thin it out. It was a bit thick for my taste.

Half non-fat plain yogurt and half mayo created a nice, not too thick consistency.  I also drizzled enough olive oil in the food processor to process the minced garlic and anchovies to a paste before adding other ingreds.  Didn't add cheese to the dressing since we like to sprinkle it over the salad.  Two good-sized garlic cloves make it plenty garlicky - I think 3 would be overwhelming.

One of the best creamy caesar dressings I've tried & super easy!  Didn't have Dijon mustard or real anchovies so had to substitute regular mustard and anchovy paste but still excellent!

I use fewer fresh garlic cloves, but otherwise this is my goto caesar dressing recipe. 6 roasted garlic cloves give it a wonderful smokey garlic flavor! I also add white vinegar because it's just too thick if followed as it's written.

Very flavorful dressing. Extremely easy to prepare and wallet friendly to boot. I will use just a tad less may next time and add a drop or 2 of tabasco for kick, but overall my family loved this.

Great sub for raw-egg dressing! I discovered this when I was pregnant and couldn't eat raw eggs; the dressing is garlicky deliciousness, and I still make it often even now that I'm allowed to eat traditional Caesar dressing.

Followed the recipe almost exactly - scaled it up to 9 servings, used paste instead of whole anchovies (what I had on hand), and added bacon to the salad.  Despite other reviews, I didn't find it too thick at all once it was added to the damp lettuce.  Will definitely keep this one for future use.

I've been using this Caesar dressing for quite some time and I absolutely love it! I've made it so many times now that I don't even always measure the ingredients! I DO use real anchovies and have used real garlic before, but have grown lazy and used dried minced garlic. It works either way! I've also made it when I didn't have anchovies. I prefer it with them, but the dressing still works without them.

Very good recipe ! Next time I will not add the croutons during tossing as they get a little soggy if not eaten right away. Instead I would just sprinkle them on top after the salad was served on chilled plates.

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  I use about a teaspoon of Anchovy paste instead of messing with chopping fillets.  You can add more paste if you desire.  I also cheat and buy the croutons.  Maybe one day when I have time I will make my own.  The dressing is fantastic and I always have people ask me for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving 09 for the second time.  This time I used 3 anchovy filets and 3 cloves of garlic and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  It was perfect...a great recipe and it was a huge it.  Love it!!!

Mmmmmm...tastes like it's from a restaurant.  I used less mayo and a little more lemon juice.  Will try others' recommendations to thin with a little olive oil, but I still think it's yummy just the way it is when tossed with lettuce thoroughly.

I make this recipe all the time and get sooo many rave reviews and requests for me to bring it to events.  The best part is that you can just throw everything in a blender or the "Magic Bullet"  and it is so quick and easy!  A couple of notes:  I never use anchovies, if anything just a tiny bit of the paste and it always turns out awesome.  One suggestion-wholegrain Dijon mustard gives a nice texture to the dressing.  However, you don't need to change a thing-this recipe is great the way it is.  PS-Homemade croutons MAKE any salad-here is a quick and easy way to make them if you don't want to mess with a fying pan:  I freeze leftover hot dog/hamburger rolls, then thaw & cut them into cubes, throw them on a cookie sheet and coat them with melted butter, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, etc and bake them in the oven until golden and mmmmm-the perfect finishing touch!

this was perfect---i have never made caesar dressing before and my husband was really craving a classic caesar salad.  i made this for him and he said it was the best he's ever had.  (i thought it was delish too!).  it was surprisingly simple to make--i substituted anchovy paste for the minced anchovy but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  i cut the recipe down to make for two people but wish i had made more to keep in the fridge! i didnt even use a blender/food processor--i simply whisked it (heavily) with a fork--worked very well.  thanks!

I moved to Australia 7 years ago and they have a totally different Ceasar dressing here, it's horrible, and I longed for my classic ceasar salad. You wouldn't believe how happy I was to find this recipe :)  I only changed the amount of garlic by half and the olive oil by half and just out of personal preference, but everything else was left the same and this recipe is AMAZING!! Thank you so much! It's my favorite caesar dressing recipe and I no longer have to pine away about missing my caesar dressing from Canada. Thank you!

Perfect recipe, as is!  Anchovy fillets are the only way to go...Just doesn't quite work with the paste.  A blender is not needed.  If you follow the recipe, you can mix by hand...no problem.  We served blackened chicken over the salad...Made a nice quick meal!

Love this dressing! I make many homemade dressings and my husband and son say this is the best I have made.  When you live on the border and can shop in Canada dry mustard is a great ingredient to add to this. Have already made twice this week.  Beats my mothers that she raves about!

The taste of the dressing good, though a little salty, even though I put less garlic. The dressing was thick, so I added a little milk and a little olive oil (like others recommended). This tastes like restaurant dressing and doesn't have the raw egg.

The thing I L-O-V-E-D about this is that it does not call for raw egg in the dressing!  I did everything exactly as instructed, including the anchovies.   No blender or food processor required; they were super simple to mince up -- I had no chunks.  We adore garlic, but you may want to start with only a clove or two and taste test as you go depending on the size of your cloves.  The dressing is thick, but if you toss it with the lettuce, it's not a problem.  If you're going to pour it, you may want to thin it with a little olive oil or something.  I used leftover French bread for my croutons and they were the best homemade croutons I've ever made.  I made one minor change:  instead of using the grated parmesan in the salad, I used shredded.  This was absolutely marvelous as written!

This was a winner on all counts - good, fast and easy.  I had low fat mayo in the fridge which was a great substitute.  Also, I keep anchovy paste in the fridge.  It's really convenient for things like this. Most deli counters sell it. I use around 1 - 2 tsp per anchovy fillet.  Start with a bit and add more to taste.  We had soem left over and made a salad two nights later. It was even better.  The flavors had really blended well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

great recipe - but WAY too much garlic... I also added milk (it was very thick) - maybe 1/6 of a cup....  I think one big clove is enough here.

This recipe was ok. I should have used a little less anchovies. One or 2 would have been plenty for me. My brothers-in-law loved it though. Otherwise it was worth trying out.

The flavor was fantastic, but it was a little too thick for me. Next time I will thin it out with milk and maybe add a little more lemon. I like a more lemony flavored dressing.

This is a fantastic recipe the only issue that I had was that it was a bit thick but I added a bit of hot water and thinned it out and it turned out great.

This recipe was awesome!  I only made half the recipe, and I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies, but it turned out great.  I just needed a quick salad dressing recipe; I didn't have time for homemade croutons. Next time I'll make sure to leave time to do the croutons too, and I'm sure it will be even better!

My husband and I had dinner recently and Ive been craving for the caesar salad that we ordered.  I immediately search for a recipe and found this "caesar salad supreme". I followed all ingredients and procedures 100% and the result....PERFECT!!! for me and my husband. I did not even finish my rib eye steak for I indulged so much on the caesar salad. Thank you so much Karen for sharing this recipe to everyone.:)

I was very pleased with this recipe. However I thought it was a little thick (about the consistency of Ranch dressing), maybe thinning it out with a little less mayo would make it the best for me. But I also didn't use the anchovies, maybe that would have affected the thickness? I made this for a party I hosted and the guests raved about it. I will try again.

Caesar Salad dressing with a kick!  Loved this recipe, followed exactly, using anchovy fillets in olive oil from a jar.  Downsized it a little and maybe had extra garlic which gave it the kick, but the flavor was terrific.  My husband said it was better than any restaurant.  Followed the Garlic Crouton recipe instead of frying in olive oil.

Good, but the dressing flavor is too strong for me.  I LOVE garlic, but I think the garlic and anchovies made for a rather strong taste.  Not my favorite.  Just depends what your preference is though.

A fabulous Caesar salad!  It's restaurant quality and very easy to make.  I reluctantly used the full amount of anchovies but I'm glad that I did.  They add a nice depth of flavor and didn't make it taste fishy.  I used store bought croutons which was fine but I will try the homemade ones next time.

This is a keeper. On the advice of another member I added a little milk to it and blended it in a blender. Perfect. My guests preferred this one to another homemade recipe I have been using for years.

This is true to its name...s supreme Caesar! I only made 2 modifications..used 3 instead of 5 anchovies, and tossed the ingredients in the food processor. SUPER simple doing it that way. I tasted it to determine need for more s&p right after it was processed, and found the flavors to be a bit too subtle. But once dressing sat in fridge while I prepared the rest of dinner, WOW did they intensify. I will start the dressing even earlier next time to allow it to rest in the fridge longer. If you're pressed for time, you can certainly use store bought, high quality croutons, but my family just loved these from-scratch ones. Can't wait to try this one out on dinner guests!

My step daughters favorite food.  She requested Caesar salad for her birthday dinner and I found this recipe.  She LOVED it and it is now a staple in our rotation. UPDATE- We love this recipe and can no longer order a Caesar when we are out.  They just don't hold up to this one. The best by far!

Yum! This recipe tastes just like the Caesar salad at restaurants here in CA. Like other reviewers, I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies (it comes in a tube and saves you the time of chopping them up), and added sliced grilled chicken tenders to make it a meal with garlic bread on the side. The dressing is a bit thick and there was a little too much of it despite using a whole head of lettuce, so next time I make this I may substitute some of the mayo with olive oil (not too much), and toss the lettuce with just half the dressing then add more to taste. My boyfriend gave me a huge kiss and thanked me for making this after taking a few bites (he's a sweetheart, but I'm sure the kiss was salad-inspired). Definitely will make it again!

I love garlicy caesar salad so I put in a lot more garlic, (and anchovies) than asked for. This is one of the best caesar salads I have ever tasted, and I've been to many a restaurant where they claim that they have a "famous" caesar. I can only think of one restaurant that can even compare - So here's a plug for Buono Appetito in Canton CT, (BYOB as well).

This was great.  I will be using this dressing over and over, it was delicious.  I used store bought croutons because I was a little short on time.  I also used another review's suggestion and added a little milk and red wine vinegar to thin the dressing just a tad.  The dressing only needed pinch of salt.

Have made this recipe several times and have made modifications each time.  I have cut back on the garlic and cut back on or omitted the anchovies (but I think it tastes best with at least a few added.)  I think it's important to use a good quality, hearty bread when making the croutons.  You may not use all the dressing--I just add it gradually to coat the ingredients lightly.

love caesar salad..this was just as good as any restaurant serves! I put the garlic, anchovies, worchestire sauce, parm cheese, dijon, and lemon juice in food processor, then added to mayo.   I like my dressing a little thinner so i added some FF milk.  Also, I did the croutons in the oven, spraying w/ PAM and sprinking garlic powder, paprika.  Yummmay!  My guests raved also!

This recipe is the best.  I have tons of recipes on caesar salad and now my search is over, I have found the perfect caesar dressing.  Although I've made some minor adjustment to suit my taste, I've added more anchovies (love 'em), this for me is a keeper.  I'll be making more of this dressing in the future. Thanks so much for the post.

It's alright as is,but it's awesome with some tweaking.  I like it with snother tablespoon of parmesan, and teaspoon of lemon juice, some hot sauce, and only a quarter of the worchestershire sauce.

Still perfect. I didn't do the bread crumbs this time, and I'm just as pleased. Anchovies are like bacon of the sea. 7/9/2008 I will definetly make this again. It was perfect!

I liked this recipe very much.  I used half of the garlic as suggested. I love garlic and I thought this change still allowed for a wonderful garlic flavor to the salad. I made the croutons using day old grocery store garlic breadsticks.  I heated them up in the toaster oven until they were crunchy,around 10 minutes.  I didn't use oil to make these croutons and they turned out wonderful.  I didn't use anchovies either.  My teenage son who doesn't like mayonnaise didn't like this recipe unfortunately.

I didn't use anchovies but it still tasted really good. I added some  plain fried chicken in there to give it a little more taste and it worked great! I'll make it again when i'm in the mood for a great caesar salad.

The dressing is really great.  I followed some other reviews and put all the ingredients in a mini chopper with a splash of red wine vinegar and milk to help combine.  I did think there was just a tad too much garlic and I really like garlic.  In fact I usually add extra garlic to most recipes.  Next time I will reduce the garlic by one clove.  I did make the croutons, which I thought were good, but I made the following modifications.  I tossed them in the garlic oil until they soaked it up and started to get slightly crispy.  Then I finished them in a 300 degree oven for 8 minutes after adding salt, pepper and parmesan cheese.

Tasted like a restaurant quality caesar salad... very very tasty!  I used anchovy paste as it was easier to use than finely chopping anchovy filets as other reviews suggested.  In an effort to but back on fat I used a scant 1/2 cup mayo and a generous 1/4 cup plain yogurt (didn't want the dressing to be too tangy).  This was good!  

My husband and I didn't care for the croutons.  I imagine that the dressing would taste even better the next day when the flavors have had an opportunity to mingle.

We really enjoyed this even though we dont usually like creamy dressings. I couldnt find anchovies in the supermarket, so I used minced sardines and it turned out great. I omitted the croutons but will try them next time.

I just realized, reading the recipe again before reviewing it, that I used ALL 6 cloves in the dressing.  I used store-bought croutons, so I didn't even catch myself!  It was SO garlicky and I wondered why.  Now I know!  Even so, it had a great flavor and I can't wait to try it again and do it right this time!  Thanks for the recipe!  New review:  Okay, now I did it right this time, including making the croutons.  Delicious!  Everyone raved about the salad.  I did saute the croutons a bit and then sprinkled them with Italian seasoning and some fresh Parmesan cheese and then baked them.  Definite keeper!

THIS WAS SOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!! MY HUSBAND LOVED IT AND HE HATES CAESAR SALAD. I DID MAKE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS. FIRST: I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND ONLY USED 2 CLOVES OF GARLIC, THAT WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH. I ALSO ADDED 1/2 CUP OF OLIVE OIL AND USED DRY MUSTARD INSTEAD OF DIJON. IT WAS AMAZING, THE BEST CAESAR DRESSING I'VE EVER HAD. THANKS

I loved this simple recipe that didn't call for a coddled egg. I added just a bit of rose-wine vinegar since I did not have Worcestershire sauce and blended the dressing with a hand blender. I accidentally used sardines instead of anchovies, but there was no noticeable difference in taste! (you just have to slightly de-bone the sardines first). The only different thing I might do next time (aside from try it with anchovies and worcestershire sauce, would be to use less mayo and more olive oil. I was told that this was a little bit too 'creamy/mayo-y'

This is the best caesar dressing I've ever tried to make myself. Adjust the amounts as needed, I like mine quite cheesy so added a little more Parmesan. Beautifully done, quick, easy and delicious! My husband LOVED IT!

Best caesar salad dressing I have ever made.  Can be made stronger with more garlic.  I used the Garlic Croutons recipe on this site and it was fantastic.

I'm always looking for _that_ certain Caesar dressing and decided on this one the other day.  It was OK but didn't resemble any Caesar I've had before so there was some mild disappointment (only in that it wasn't what I was expecting).  I'll probably give it another shot someday.

I omitted the anchovies then added a tiny bit more of lemon juice and worcestershire  and it seemed to make up for it.  I made it for a couple of caesar salad lovers and they were impressed that I had made the dressing.  Will definitely make it again!

This is a delicious recipe that you can't find in a bottle at a grocery store.  Although, I did find the garlic overwhelming so I like to cut it down to 3-4 cloves.  I also recommend blending in a food processor.

This was my first time making croutons, and they were fantastic!  The dressing could have been a little thinner (maybe add a tbls of milk?).  I didn't have Dijon mustard, but it seemed fine without it.  This was a hit with the family, and I will definitely make it again!!

Pretty good recipe overall. I gave it a four because I thought it was too mayonnaisy.  I made a few changes based on previous reviews.  I dont care for anchovies too much so I reduced to one, lessened the garlic and added a little bit of red wine vinegar to cut the thickness of it.  I also blended in a mini food processor and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Best Caesar salad recipe I've found.  I cut the anchovy fillets to 4, let the dressing sit a few hours in the refrig and added some grated Parmesan cheese to finished product.  I have made at least a dozen times and love it topped with grilled chicken!

This was delicious!  I omited the anchovies, and added one Tablespoon of apple cidar vinegar, and substitued half the olive oil for flax oil.  This caesar dressing was the best I've had. Thanks!

I'm not sure how to rate this. The taste was extremely strong but I'm not sure if that is due to the mustard I used or the recipe itself. It was almost spicey the taste was so strong. Also, I think this makes way too much for one salad, I had a lot left over. I think next time I make it I may use a mild mustard, perhaps the dijon I used was too strong, and I will cut the recipe in half if I am intending to use it for one salad.

Good! I omitted the anchovies and added grilled chicken breast strips. I also added a little extra lemon juice and dijon to help mask the intense mayo taste.

This was by far the best Caesar Salad I have ever had. I had a dinner party last night and served this. Everyone wanted more. The only change was anchovy paste for the filets, everything else was as given. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I will be making it often.

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMY! I have made this quite a few times, I made the mistake of using all of the garlic and parm cheese becuase I did not read the entire recipe:-) If you follow this recipe EXACTLY, and I mean actually measure out the ingredients (I like to eyeball it) it comes out PERFECT. It is good with ancohvies, and good without (not usually something I have one hand and I make this a lot) I also use cut up bagels for the crutons, and add marinated grilled chicken and this is a perfect light meal!

Wonderful!! The anchovies are an absolute must... and it doesn't taste fishy at all. Since I couldn't find any anchovies at the grocery store, I ended up buying anchovy paste at my local Fishery. So I replaced the anchovies for anchovy paste. Tasted great and the paste can keep fresh for a good while in the fridge. This salad tasted so good, I won't be able to go back to store-bought salad dressing!!

Excellent recipe. Whipped this up for my roommates and neighbors along with a homemade recipe for fettucinne alfredo and everything was eaten in about 20 minutes. I forgot the Worcestershire sauce and it was still amazing. One note: I mixed up half the croutons with some oregano as well to give them a little bit of a different flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as written including the croutons and I just LOVED it! I am a big fan of Caesar Salads and have been craving them alot lately. This is worth the fuss. It definitely hit the spot with it's undeniable restaraunt quality taste! I will be making this often for sure!

I thought this was a really nice salad. The dressing wasn't to think or heavy. I did not add the anchovy and I didn't miss them. I did add cayane pepper though to add some spice and it turned out very nice! I made it ahead of time and got it nice and cold prior to putting it on the salad!

Really good.  Having 5 anchovies was a bit too much for our tastes.  We liked it better using only 3.  Very creamy.  A little of the dressing goes a long way.

This really was outstanding,  although I must admit that I left the anchovies OUT.  Can't stand the flavor they bring.  My boyfriend actually added more to his plate after the initial taste test.  Thanks.

Delicious combination of flavors and the homemade croutons are fabulous!  I don't like quite this much dressing on my salad but that is just personal preference. Excellent.

Yum, yum, and MORE yum!  This is the first homemade salad that I would dare say I'd eat everyday!  My picky 3yo even loved it.  I omitted the anchovies only because I'm not a big fan of them and instead of using 3 cloves of garlic, I used one large in the dressing.  2 large cloves with the croutons (which were to DIE for by the way!).  Thanks for the fantastic recipe. I'm sure we'll have this once a week!

I tried another recipe, lately, with a homemade mayo. It was great but it took me over 45 minutes to do(with 20 minutes just for the mayonnaise...). So I wanted to try another one. I did this one in only 5 minutes!!!! I put in croutons bought from the store, marbled cheddar cheese(I have a low budget, lately) and added a dash of red wine vinegar and a dash of powdered mustard to the sauce. It was amazing! I've been to a lot of expensive restaurants in my life and this is pretty much what REAL ceasar salads taste like!! Amazing!! I'll definetly make this when I will have guest come over for supper. Too bad my boyfriend hates mayo and garlic...:(

This was absolutely delicious.  Just like what they serve in restaurants.  I've always wondered how they make the dressing. I've tried every kind in the stores, and they never even come close to the kind you get in a restaurant.  The homemade croutons are also delicious.

This dressing was restaurant quality, I reduced the anchovies by half to suit my taste. I used to go to restaurants to get a caesar salad just because I couldn't find a decent dressing in the grocery store and now I can make your own. Thank you for sharing this!

Delicious!  Will make again.  I make a traditional Caesar salad dressing (olive oil only)and this is equally delicious and very easy.  I kept all the garlic and would not hesitate to add more.  We love garlic.  I used anchovy paste (quick & easy).  Made for company and everyone commented on the excellent flavor.

I followed the directions exactly, except we applied our own dressing individually, and I didn't think there was enough to coat a whole head of lettuce.  But it was delicious--a nice change from a more traditional Caesar.

I didn't add the anchovies, but the salad was excellent. The dressing was a little thick, so I took othes advice and added some milk to thin it out.

Good flavor but too creamy.  Recipe needed to combine some olive oil to thin the dressing. With that said, the flavor was well done.

Amazing - better than any restaurant or any caesar salad I've every had.  Be sure not to overdo it on the dressing - I never use all of it.  I also just cook some chicken in a in a little olive oil then toss with the extra dressing and its a meal!

This is absolutely AWESOME!!!  (Can I give it 6 stars?!!?) I've made it several times but misplaced my hard copy and there was no question ~ just had to keep searching til I found this one!  It's perfect exactly as is and not only do WE love it, but it's even a big hit with non-anchovy loving guests you might have!!!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. :) The first time, I made it as is and it was too much mayo and garlic for me, the next time I halved both and didn't get much of a Caesar taste. I'll keep on playing with it, but I feel like something is missing/off. By the way, I didn't care much for the croutons, I found them too oily.

This recipe was really good!  I left out the anchovies because I am not a big fan of them.  I added chicken to it and it was a hit!! Thanks!

Very good. A Caesar salad without anchovies is not a Ceasar Salad, but an egg yolk is missing!!!! in good restaurants in Mexico Ceasar salad is prepared at your table(for 2) Once you try this salad there is no room for imitaion!

Wow!  This is an AWESOME caesar salad!  I took shortcuts and used 2 teaspoons anchovy paste like others suggested, as well as store bought croutons.  Also low fat mayo (tastes the same to us)  It was the perfect salad and so very quick to make.  It was my boyfriend's first time tasting caesar salad and he loved it, too- quite the compliment coming from someone who only likes ranch.  This was great paired with cornbread and pan fried smoked turkey sausage on the side.  Thank you!

Yummy salad and dressing.  The dressing is a little thick though and it needs more lemon juice.

A great tasting, very creamy alternative to a classic Caesar- esp. when you need to avoid the use of raw eggs (some guests can't or won't eat raw eggs).  I went with prepared garlic-parmesan bread crumbs from a local store known for this kind of thing (Eli's Caesar Crunch if you live in NYC or want to buy online) and it was terrific. Suggestion: If you aren't making the crumbs, adjust the amounts for Garlic and Parmesan both to "3", as you might accidentally use double these in the dressing if you are just scanning a printed ingredient list.

I made this tonight for dinner, and WOW!  Delicious!!!  I even used light mayonnaise instead of regular.  I used the leftover bread that I made last night for the croutons, which came from the "Best Bread Machine Bread" recipe here on allrecipes.com, and they were fantastic!!!  I would recommend using more than 1/4 cup of olive oil to make the croutons though - 1/2 cup would have covered them better.  I will also make chicken next time to make it a bit more healthy meal with the added protein.  GREAT RECIPE!!!  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious!  I added a little thyme to the croutons, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.  (I used low-fat mayo, you'd never know :op)

This recipe is great. I altered it a bit though, i tripled the Worceshire sauce and Lemon juice, because it as a bit thick, and i browned some garlic in olive oil and cooked some chicken and added that into it. It was great

My family loved this at Easter.  Very quick to make and had a wonderful taste.  I used anchovy paste instead of fillets and used store bought croutons.  I will make this again!

This was wonderful!  I used anchovy paste instead of fillets and had to add about 1/4 C. of water because it was so thick.  I put everything in the food processor, so blending was a snap.  Only one family member didn't like it, but he doesn't like mayonaise.  Better than any bottled dressing on the market that I have tried!

This is an easy and healthier alternative to traditional Caeser (no raw eggs)...Very tasty.
