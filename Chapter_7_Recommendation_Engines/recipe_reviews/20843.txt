Oh so simple and oh so good!  I used a little less milk because I like things a bit thicker.  I put these in nice tall glasses and topped them with whipped cream and more chocolate syrup.  All that was left to do was enjoy them right down to the last drop!

The taste was really good, but the shakes weren't very thick.  We also used different flavor's of ice cream and in place of the chocolate syrup we used Nescafe's Ice Java chocolate mocha syrup.  I will make this again but with less milk to try to thicken it up.

This is as simple as it can get! For the others who say its not thick...It says in instructions to use less milk if you prefer thick. This is something that can be played with. I will try mint choc chip next time.

This recipe didn't sound amazing at first, but after making it I learned that it is GREAT! I didn't measure the cups of ice cream - just took giant scoops out of the carton and dumped them into the blender. As for the milk, I changed two things: I used 1/2 a cup instead of a whole, and I used 4% milk instead of regular. The chocolate syrup all floated down to the bottom and sat underneath the blades, but that was okay - I just drizzled it on top of the shake when it came out last. If it had mixed in, it probably would have been too chocolatey. I LOVED this shake - not too thick, not too thin, not too chocolatey. The best!

This tasted just like an IN-N-OUT shake! I used 1/2 cup of 2% milk and two huge scoops of vanilla ice cream (all I had) then a tablespoon of chcolate syrup. Yum!

This was the simplest and best recipe! In order to have a thicker shake, add less milk. I've tried both ways, and I prefer thicker, but they both taste absolutely delicious!

I can't believe I've been spending $4 on shakes all this time and I could've made them. It tastes even better than bought ones. I used 1/2 cup 2% milk because i like them thick. So delicious, I'm gong to try pineapple shakes with vanilla ice cream and canned crushed pineapple. Yum yum

As per the other reviews I used half the milk and got a big thumbs up from my kids.  Will definitely be making this again - simple is sometimes best.  :)

We used Marble Ice Cream in place of the chocolate ice cream -- exactly what I was looking for!  Thank you for a no frills - excellent recipe!  My children and my own chocolate fix -- satisfied!

Yum! I only had vanilla ice cream, but the shake was wonderful.  My husband added a little malt powder when he made this recipe - delicious!

Purr-fect! So easy to make and exactly what I pay double for at the local deli. 

Based on the reviews of others I kept the milk less.

I like to use a little less milk when I make this for a thicker shake. This also is really good with chocolate frozen yogurt and reduced fat milk for a lighter chocolate shake.

So good, and so easy! definitely let the ice cream get a little soft or it may be clumpy; I had to switch my blender to puree to get the clumps out at the bottom.  Really delicious, and perfect for dessert on a hot summer day.  Thank you for sharing.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! It doesn't get much easier than this! I only used 1/2 cup of milk, and it was still on the thin side (maybe the blending thins it). I topped it with whipped cream and a more of the chocolate syrup! Yum!

Reminds me of my childhood! Me and siblings always made milk shakes. If we didn't want to dirty the blender we would just mix in a bowl or cup... I left out the syrup making this with my kids tonight.
