Our whole family liked this. We didn't use the bell peppers and used regular crackers but the cheese sauce was a hit and it's super easy! Definitely a great "all I have in the fridge is ground beef" kind of recipe! Will be putting in our recipe book to make again!!

Cheese Sauce was a huge success; I think onions and green peppers should have been cooked prior to adding in to cut down on their crunchiness. Other than that, first meatloaf I've every done and it was AWESOME!!

No photo because it went so fast! Very easy to make and it was delicious. The cheese and sour cream mixed in makes it incredibly moist. I was worried that the cream and cheese would overtake the flavor of the meat, but it doesn't. Will be making this again.

My husband says this is our new "go to" meatloaf. The sauce is so simple but really makes the dish.

This turned out pretty good.  I am going to swap out the green peppers for orange ones next time. I also used a whole sleeve of ritz and not just 1 cup. With some slight tweaks it will be awesome.

The gravy did not go well with the Meatloaf. I could have done without it. Also the meatloaf itself was a bit blend.

It was pretty good. It needed some salt.
