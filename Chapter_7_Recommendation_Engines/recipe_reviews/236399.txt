This recipe was really good and easy as you do not have to cook  the sauce. I used Barilla Plus penne because I did not have whole grain spaghetti: the result was delicious. I love the fresheness that the orange zest brings to the nuts pesto. On my second portion I added a spoon of ricotta cheese and this made the pesto creamier!!

My family disliked the competing flavor of oranges vs nuts. It did smell good but the taste not so much.

This nut pesto was just interesting enough that I had to try it and boy am I glad I did.   I just love the refreshing flavors of this sauce!   I make basil pesto all the time and it's a very strong sauce.   This pesto is more delicate summer version.   The orange is very mild in this, but adds a touch of sweetness to the nuts.   I upped the garlic as always, but that's personal taste.  If you're a salt lover like me, you'll want to toss some of that in too.   Thank you, Barilla, for posting!!!

Great tasting dish! Love the whole grains! Sauce was super easy to make. This was good cold as well.
