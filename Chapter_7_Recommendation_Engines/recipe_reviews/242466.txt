Okay my new go to! The only complaint from the kids was they needed to be a little more sweet.  The first time I made then as stated and I loved them. The second time I added about half a 1/4th cup more brown sugar & I only has small eggs (I have chickens so use what they give me) so I used 2 small eggs and I added about 1/4 cup peanut butter. They turned out wonderfully!!! So this is a verseatile recipe. Definitely a keeper.

These came out really great. Everyone in my office (who are NOT gluten free) thought they were really good. I made mine kind of large and kept them fairly thick so the middle remained nice and moist while the top and bottom were just perfectly lightly golden brown. The entire batter made 10 cookies. I increased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, other than that I made them exactly as described in recipe. I will be using this recipe as a base for lots of other cookies! Very good!

Really good. The husband and I are going low carb which means... no beer! So while these aren't technically low carb because of the sugar, the almond flour cuts it down considerably. We subbed for cannabutter and dark chocolate chips, made them bite-sized and made a batch with just butter and milk chocolate chips for the kids. I don't even miss beer :D May try subbing the brown sugar for some kind of fake sugar but man... I don't know... the brown sugar shines through in these and makes them really taste like a glutinous flour-based chocolate chip cookie.  Kids loved the kid-friendly ones, the youngest (3) couldn't tell the difference and the oldest (15) knew but still said they were good.  For the cannabutter cookies, I dropped the temperature to 325 and cooked them a bit longer to compensate.

I followed the recipe to a T. They were too dry to make a cookie out of, but I did gather some dough into a ball and baked one. Was awful and crumbled to the touch. Then I added some more butter and another egg. Still a dry dough. Baked the cookies and I gag on them. Anyone else have a dry dough? I don't get it :( Worst cookies I've ever made.

I liked these but wanted them sweeter and without sugar. After a few experiments I settled on 1/2 cup swerve instead of the brown sugar, and added 2 tsp of molasses to get the brown sugar taste, also added 2 tbsp of crunchy almond butter, and I used coconut oil instead of butter for a little firmer texture. My family thinks they are awesome . Swerve is primarily erythritol. I also used sugar free chocolate chips.

Only change I made was coconut oil instead of butter.  These came out perfect!  Very good cookie feel, not too sweet, but simply delicious.

Great recipe. Also works just fine if you don't have almond flour and just grind a few cups of almonds in a vitamix. Did not miss the flour at all.

The recipe works great as gluten free.  I substituted 1 tablespoon coconut oil for the butter and carob chips for the chocolate chips to make it dairy free as well.

I made these cookies. The only change I made was I used Cashew meal because it was all I had. I made them for a friend who must eat gluten free. They were awesome!! She lived them. Even my husband thought they were great. They were a little more coarse but he loves lots of nuts in cookies so these were a real treat.

I opted to switch out butter for coconut oil and vanilla for almond extract to enhance the almond flavour.  My cookies took almost 20 minutes to "cook" (develop a slight golden tint) on parchment paper.  They didn't spread at all, which is fine.  Interior slightly moist, not too crunchy.   Verdict: delicious.   Next time I'll omit the chocolate chips and perhaps add some slivered toasted almonds on top.  I've never baked a flourless cookie / cake, but these turned out nicely.  I'm not sure why some felt the batter was too dry, but you can always add another 1/2 to 1 tablespoon butter / oil once the flour is in (since it mixes for at least one minute).  Made 16 cookies.  Thanks for the recipe and tips.

Don't care about gluten-free, but GREAT for low carbs for my diabetic husband. I use sugar-free chocolate chips and Splenda. Yes, I will be making it often.

Only one left. This is the most success I had with any cookie recipe. Crunchy edges and soft in the middle. I added 2 more tablespoons of brown sugar and Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate. Great recipe.

very impressed. I had low expectations and this was pretty great. It isn't a dupe of a regular cookie there is so much less butter etc but this is a healthier version that tastes great. 

I subed erythritol for the sugar and used a tsp of molasses . Also  I used Lillys chocolate chips . I am doing low carb . Even with the adjustments it was great.

These are so easy to make, and delicious! I was worried that the dough seemed a bit soft, that didn't turn out to be a problem, only issue was that they kept burning on the bottom before the top had cooked, even when I moved them up a shelf in the oven.

Excellent GF cookie! I used Earth Balance stick instead of butter, and GF DF carob chips because I can't have chocolate, added a bit more sugar per one of the other reviews, and these are awesome. Mixer not necessary, I just usef a fork. I baked on a silpat. Next time I'll try to find a finer grind of almond meal, as the texture was a bit noticeable. Otherwise pretty perfect! Warmed in the microwave for 10 sec is heaven.
ETA: I now use a rounded 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 3-4 Tbsp margarine, as they stay chewier after cooling that way.

Great cookies. Looking for gluten free recipes to try and share with boyfriends mom that is gluten intolerant. High altitude makes cookies dry so I modified. 
Sub 1/2 cup almond flour for unblanched almond meal for texture. Add 3/4 banana (mashed) mixed with a tablespoon of coconut almond milk. Super moist, very soft cookies (even after cooled) absolutely delicious.

My husband has many allergies, but he loves chocolate chip cookies. These were the first cookies he could eat without really hurting in a long time, and he loves them! Thank you! I used Bob's Mill Almond flour, so I know other almond flours work just fine. Use them with confidence!

Very good. We have been watching our sugar and carb intake for 5 months. Making these cookies were a real treat. We have now made about four batches. So I’d say they’re pretty darn good.

Excellent!  I made only one change to this recipe and the cookies were perfect.  Other people noted that they were dry, so I added an extra tablespoon of butter.  Also, if you cook them for only 9 or 10 minutes, they are less dry and more moist inside.  On my second batch, I added 3 T of cocoa powder to make a chocolate-chocolate chip cookie.  WOW!  They were better than the regular ones.  This recipe is a winner as is or with cocoa. Once baked, try freezing them - they're great cold, right out of the freezer!

This is a solid gluten free recipe that I have made several times. 
Now that I’ve gotten to know the recipe, I add 1/4t allspice & nutmeg, along with 1/2t cinnamon.
I still think it’s missing something, but is a good easy afternoon cookie.

Great healthy alternative to those who love Chocolate Chip cookies.  I could never get my cookies (with the standard Toll House recipe, to be chunky and moist. These come out with depth, chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. I did take head the warning from another rating that said they were not so sweet, and I added 1/4 Cup of Stevia with the Brown Sugar (Organic Light Brown Sugar). They are perfect!!! Thank You All Recipes for finally making Gluten Free taste amazing!

Like some people said, the dough was extremely dry so I added peanut butter and a little coconut oil, which helped. I also used oatmeal flour bc I happened to have it as well as crumbled up coconut dark chocolate bark instead of chocolate chips. I think I would add a little more sugar next time. But not bad for a 'healthy' cookie to go with morning coffee/milk.

As several others discovered, these turn out dry, crumbly and lacking in flavor when prepared as written. We have been cooking gluten and even grain free for years and there are far better recipes out there. It would have been nice if other reviewers actually rated the recipe as written rather than their own modified recipe.

Definitely a keeper recipe!
Almond flour is high in protein and monounsaturated fat (good), is cholesterol free, lots of vitamin E.....although it is quite pricey.
These cookies are very easy to make and taste very good too!
Recipe makes about 16 medium sized dense cookies.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good these were.  Gluten-free cookies have come a long way!  These were yummy.  I made these for my girl scout troop (& a girl who is newly on a gluten-free diet).  All the girls loved them :)

Nice consistency and subtle almond flavor. I used maple syrup instead of vanilla because I'm out but I couldn't tell the difference! My only qualm after tasting is that they're not very sweet so that was a little disappointing. They tasted more like a bisquit then a cookie. Next time I make them I'll probably play with increasing the sugar

I needed a lower carb version so I used erythritol and stevia and 1 T honey instead of sugar. Added one T more butter and the cookies were just great

Made great looking cookies.  I did not care for them.  My son, whose health forced him to go gluten free, said they would be great used like an ice cream sandwich.  

His wife liked them better than the two of us.  I thought they were just plain bland, so I am going to work on the recipe a bit and try again.

I would make these again. The family wasn’t that keen on them but I need a little something sweet every now and then so these will work nicely. I subbed a few things because I had them on hand. Used coconut sugar and dark chocolate chips plus a plant based butter type spread.

These are excellent!....and that's from a person who is not GF! I used Red Mill Gluten Free Almond Flour (that's what I happened to have in the cupboard) and about 2/3 c. milk chocolate chips.
Bake for 11 minutes in 350 degree oven.

Not dry or crumbly. Used a brown sugar alternative,along with extra dark choc nibs to make it keto friendly. Also add a dash of monk fruit sweetener on the top for that little something extra.  Turned out delicious!

Not crispy, more cake like, but good. I omitted the chocolate chips inside, and rather melted the chocolate and decorated the tops of the cookies/bars. I used the Wilton 12 cavity ice cream sandwich pan to make the nice pattern.

I gotta say, I was very skeptical of these as they have way less sugar/butter/etc. than any other cookies I've made before. But WOW did I love them! I don't have a huge sweet tooth, so these were perfect for me. My husband does have a sweet tooth, and he liked them but would have preferred them to be a bit more decadent. This one is getting saved as a favorite for me though!

I did not make any changes. This is my first time making these. Batch was smaller than I anticipated. I have to start eating gluten free and this was my first recipe. They are not tollhouse, but I like them. I will put few more chocolate chips in next time and call it a day. I like the fact they are not very sweet.

Sorry but these were not good at all. I had to add 4 tablespoons of coconut milk just to get this recipe to blend, and after cooking, they tasted like hay. The recipe needs more brown sugar, butter and possibly milk to get it to taste decent. Fail.

Made this GF recipe, and was very pleased with the results. Made the cookies smaller than recommended, and they came out great, with just a little crumbliness. Even people who don't  have to eat GF enjoyed these cookies.

Really good but I found it lacked flavour.  I will definitely make these again but add cinnamon and use TBS of vanilla instead of TSP.  I also agree about adding more sugar, especially if you're hoping the kids will eat them.  But a great GF cookie recipe that I will tweak and use as a staple.

Obviously nothing beats a homemade chocolate chip cookie loaded with all the sugars!! BUT these are good. :) I didn’t do any substitutions. I had to bake them a little longer on my bar pan, but that’s no biggie. Getting ready to dip them in almond milk!!

I added one tablespoon of cream cheese and used half a cup of coconut palm sugar instead of 1/4 cup brown sugar. They came out a bit paler than I wish but the taste and texture was perfect and delicious.

Not to bad... I almost want to try the recipe with Almond extract instead of vanilla.

Otherwise, they are pretty good and will be made again.

Great cookies. Will make again. I doubled recipe and I added a teaspoon of cream of tartar. I also more chocolate chips than needed and more sugar than needed. My baby brother loved them. My dad who only likes perfect cookies, loved them. My brother ate three in one sitting. Awesome recipe.

These are delicious! I increased to 32 cookies and added 1/4 cup of peanut butter, as someone suggested, and 1/2 cup of Bob' Red Mill Old Fashion glutton free rolled oats.  I also used peanut butter/chocolate chips.

Excellent alternative. I made mine per the recipe except unused sugar free chocolate chips and Splenda brown sugar mix. I am doing low carb and wanted an alternative.  My husband loves these and he's pretty picky! I have to hide them from them or I won't get any! They are best right out of the oven but they do remain soft and chewy.

The dough was waaaaay too dry. I tried to add more butter, another egg, and even some coconut oil to make it to where I could form it into some semblance of cookie dough .  A lot of people had success, however, so I guess this was user error. :(

This is a good recipe. I took the advice to use 1/3 cup brown sugar and was happy with that decision. The cookies were a little cakey for me so next time, I think I’ll add an egg and/ or some peanut butter.

Good idea but definitely needs more fat as they're a bit dry.  I also added 1/4 cup of roasted pecans.  Next time, I'll probably add a little maple syrup to give it some richness.  I will try these again, though!

OH.
Should've stuck to my original recipe but I figured this looked simple, less ingredients.
Cookies came out very dry and didn't change size after cooking. Couldn't figure out when they were done. Got stuck all in my teeth.

Terrible! I followed the recipe to a T and they came out round and raw in the middle. Total disappointment. They went into the trash and had to quickly buy store bought for my daughter's party.

Made these using 4 tbsp butter, 2/3 cup white sugar and 3 tbsp molasses (only because I was out of brown sugar) and they were very good. The amount of sugar listed just didn't seem like enough, compared to other chocolate chip cookies. They still weren't as sweet as regular cookies, but that works out fine with the almond flour. We are not gluten free, but we enjoy the almond flour as a yummy change sometimes. They are heartier and have a nice, rich flavor. 4 stars given due to changes.

Thank you for this amazing recipe! I added walnuts to make it even tastier if you like nuts. Instead of brown sugar I used coconut sugar. I will make this OFTEN, after all, it is a healthy substitute for cookies I want but can't eat.

Excellent cookie and it comes out beautifully but it is different from a regular chocolate chip cookie.  I'm not GF but thought it might be good to pass on the flour. If I had to be GF, this cookie would be amazing. The texture is light,  held together well to form a beautiful cookie but could fall apart easily if it had to travel somewhere.  I miss the chewie texture of a regular cookie that holds it together. My almond flour is not extremely fine so there were tiny bits of almond to provide some texture. Perhaps if I added some walnuts?  I also found that I felt very full after 3 little cookies.  I guess the almond flour packs a punch!

I just made these with these alterations.  First, I did half butter, and half coconut oil.  I added 1 teaspoon of molasses, and finally I emptied a box of vanilla pudding mix in the dough.  Very delicious of course!!!!  And LA approved, gluten-free, vegan, and paleo. Lol

These cookies were a hit with my GF and non-GF family members alike! I used 3 tbsp of butter and only had 1 cup of almond flour so I substituted the rest with steel cut oats. Will definitely make again!

I made these to take to a retreat where there were a couple of people who are gluten intolerant.  At the suggestion of other reviews, I increased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the baking soda a little.  They were delicious!  I had to limit my son to one cookie because it's a small batch.  I didn't want to risk doubling the recipe because I'm not experienced in gluten-free baking.  It might make a difference.  My gluten-averse friends were delighted and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make them again!

My daughter loves them so that's a huge plus aside from the fact they are gluten free. I prefer almond flour over coconut and loved the consistency of these. I was easily able to make the GMO free and organic based on the quality of the ingredients I used. I would make these again but I will add chopped pecans  and maybe try them with milk chocolate chips. I followed the recipe as written but mine are moist and not crispy after cooling  which is okay with us since we prefer soft cookies versus dry and crispy.

I made these as a thank-you to a friend who can't eat gluten.  She always complains how everything gluten free tastes like cardboard. These do not fit into that category. These were so tasty I almost didn't want to give them to her. Definitely worth the extra cost of the almond flour as apposed to rice flour.

I used coconut oil and added a few coconut flakes.  The texture and flavor was awesome.  This CCC recipe exceeded my expectations beyond anything I could have hoped for since I am new to using almond flour (...also, I used Bob's Mill AF).

These are amazing!!!  Made them with coconut oil for my GFCF son...I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to stay away from them.  They are just perfect.   FYI this recipe only makes about 16-18 cookies or so.

This was way better than my previous almond-flour chocolate chip cookie recipe. And with so little sugar, I didn't mind using sugar instead of honey.
