I think chili is one of those things in which we all expect something slightly different. I think that this is a really good recipe, or at least the the base to a really great chili.  I have made it at least 3 times now.  I made it in a slow cooker/crockpot for the first time yesterday....came out thinner than in my soup pot, so keep that in mind(nonetheless, I thought it was my best tasting batch yet). I like a little more beans so I bought a bigger can of pinto beans.  I also put a small can of diced tomatoes for chili in the pot(my husband doesn't like chunks of tomatoes).  If I have any tomato products that I want to clean out of my fridge(ex. salsa, chili sauce, etc.), I throw those in too. I also use 3 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of the white.  And I am usually doubling the spices(except for the chili powder and I haven't tried cayenne pepper yet).  I really don't think you can go wrong with this. I get compliments everytime.  Since I am new to making chili, I keep referring to this one to make sure I get at least the basics in. Try it. Taste it.  And if you need to...modify to your taste.  That's what I do.  Then I usually put it on top of some macaroni noodles and top that with sharp cheddar, chopped onion, and Fritos....YUM!!!

This Chili was very hearty and tasty. The only change I made was to use the canned tomatoes in their own juices in lieu of the tomato juice. I believe this helped with this chili turning out more hearty rather than liquidly. Will definitely make again!

I've been searching for a chili recipe that would catch my eye for a long time now.  I saw this one and what caught my eye was the # of reviews, so I printed it up and tried it out.  I got rave reviews on my chili yesterday, so much so that my husband brought some to his mom to try; she's Italian and she even liked it!  I made a few changes as well - I replaced the tomato juice with 2 cans of plum tomatoes that I diced myself, I used dry kidney and pinto beans and soaked them in water the night before. I bought a can of chipotle peppers in tomato sauce and added two of the peppers from the can. I slow cooked overnight for 10 hours - the smell was divine, the taste - out of this world!  The chipotle peppers gave the chili a slight smokey taste and an extra zing that was well recieved.  This is definitely MY new chili recipe and will be going into our annual family cookbook!

Decided to try "homemade" chili and glad I choose this recipe....  Absolutely delicious!  Didn't have regular chili powder, so I subbed New Mexico red chili powder - don't know if it made a difference, but it turned out fabulous. Thanks George!!!

I have entered this in my church chili cookoff, and finally with this I won!!!  I added chopped garlic.  i also used bloodymary mix instead of tomatojuice, and used only half of what was called for with that.  Really tastey, not too hot, if you want hot add some more cayenne  pepper.

Chili is a hard thing to rate/make/read suggestions and comments about. Its just one of those things that can be made SOOO different and be SOO good many different ways!! I thought this chili was good, and especially good for a base chili and then you modify to make it suit your tastes. I followed others suggestions and cut out the tomato juice all together and used 2 cans tomato sauce and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Next time I will only use 1 can tomato sauce. It seemed too thick but once it started heating up it was a little more liquidy than I liked. It was good though. My boyfriend rated it a 3.5. Me a 4 and our friend who was over a 5! So... anyways all in all I thought this was good especially for a beginner Chili Maker! Oh, I also forgot to mention I browned my meat beforehand w/garlic cloves and onion and then put everything in the crock pot!

This chili was delicious! I made it in my Crockpot. I don't like green peppers, so I omitted them. I also used two cans of stewed tomatoes instead of tomato juice. Grocery didn't have pinto beans so I doubled the amount of kidney beans. Here is a note: follow the directions and do not let the chili cook for more than ten hours in the pot! Otherwise, the meat will become very mushy (mine had the consistency of corned beef hash). Still, I'll definitely make this recipe again. Next time, I think I'll add some garlic. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This chili was amazing and so easy to make! I made it for my superbowl party of 18 this weekend, and thankfully I had doubled the recipe. I kept getting compliments left and right on this chili.
I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, a tablespoon of cocoa powder and used V-8 juice instead of tomato juice. 
Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and will certainly make this again!

I didn't use the tomato juice, substituted some canned tomatoes I had (and wanted to use up LOL).  I thought that it turned out well.  However, after I was done, I added a dollup of sour cream and some shredded cheddar and it was great.  I served with some garlic cheese bread I made.  I made it in the crock pot, adding the meat after browning and draining the fat.  We had four good meals out of it!  Good all around chili!

Really good.  It gives you a kick at the back of the throat.  I did halve the tomato juice as everyone suggested.  I also used half the tomato sauce and replaced it with rotel.  I browned the ground beef and onions before I put it into the crock pot (that way I could drain it before I put it in).  Then I added everything else and left it.  Easy and tasty.

This is the best chili recipe ever. My husband loved it, even my son who is a picky eater. Only 1 thing was missing - tomatoes. I added 1 can of diced tomatoes (undrained) but could easily use 2 cans next time. I made mine on the stove and it does thicken, I was worried it wouldn't. Even better as leftovers. Nice one George.

In place of the tomato juice I  substituted one 28 oz. can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano; 1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes with green pepper, celery and onions; and about 1/2 of a 14.5 oz. can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic.  I added approximately 1/2 c. diced celery, two or three green onions, three jalapeno slices, and some minced garlic.  I also used brown sugar instead of white and doubled the oregano, pepper, cumin, and cayenne.  This chili was great.  The only thing I might do differently next time would be to add another round of seasonings a few minutes before the chili’s finished cooking—just to add a little extra flavor.  Fabulous with sour cream and shredded cheese—most definitely a keeper.

Very good basic recipe.  First time I made this I followed recipe as written, having made this many times these are the modifications I now make: Add 1 pound italian sausage to the beef mixture. Decrease tomato sauce to 16 oz, add the following: 2 cans diced tomotoes ( drained), double the beans, 1 tsp paprika, increase cumin to 2 tsp, 1 T worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp red pepper sauce ( Franks brand), increase cayene pepper to 1/4 tsp, 1 tsp basil, 1 T garlic ( minced), 1 T cocoa, 8 oz beer.  Skip the white sugar and use 1 T brown sugar instead.   As listed this is a great starting point for chili, by customizing it this becomes outstanding! Thanks George for sharing!

This is a pretty good chili recipe. The only reason I took away a star, is because I changed it a smidge. I left out the tomato juice and used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes, and a 14 oz can of tomato sauce in its place. I used all kidney beans, and I cooked the onion and bell pepper with the meat. Oh and I added garlic, and some red pepper flakes. The seasonings were right on though. This one is a keeper.

This was a very bland recipe. It wasn't bad, but nothing too exciting either. I suppose its a decent base, however if there is a next time I'm planning on REALLY playing with spices

We love Chili by George!! So does everyone we make this recipe for. The small changes I make are browning the beef with the onion and adding 2 - 3 garlic cloves; substituting diced tomatoes, not drained, in place of the tomato juice; I double the green bell pepper, the cayenne, and oregano.

We loved this recipe from the get go with only the diced tomato substitution. I still would have given a 5 star review. We have made this lots and lots. The changes above are just altered to our tastes over time.

Thanks George!!!

"This is about the 8th time I have made this
chili recipe.  Its is the best. I still use
my slow cooker, because I think the flavors
blend more.  This time however, I used buffalo
burger instead, it was better than than hamburger.
I still use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.
I also use red and green tobasco, and cilantro.
This is a real keeper!"

I made this yesterday in the Crockpot and it was FABULOUS!!  My husband still hasn't stopped talking about it.  I subbed the juice for diced tomatoes, used brown sugar instead of white and added a little minced garlic.  I did spice up my bowl a little more with extra cayenne but the low heat was perfect for my husband and daughter.  We all loved it.  This will be our go-to recipe from now on.  Thanks, George!

I changed this a bit: 1.5 lbs beef for chili, 46oz crushed tomatoes, 15 oz diced fire roasted tomatoes, 15 oz dark red kidney beans undrained, one whole vadalia onion chopped, 2 cloves garlic chopped,  2 tsp sugar, 1/4 c. red wine vinegar,  1/2 c. water, tbs beef bullion, oregano, cumin, pepper, sea salt, 3 tbs chili powder.  Unbelievably delicious! All in slow cooker for 4 hours.  I think the red wine vinegar and the sugar really made the difference.

I made this chili last night for a luncheon today at work and this was excellent! Not a drop was left behind. This was the best chili I've had since my mom's. I will be making this my only chili recipe from now on. The only thing I did differently was to add 1 lb of ground beef and 1 pound of ground pork. I don't care for kidney beans so I used 2 cans pinto and 2 cans black beans. Delicious!! Thanks George, this was a fantastic recipe. And super easy.

Great basic chili recipe...I tweak it every time and it turns out great.  Recommend cutting the tomato juice back unless you like it soupy.

Good, it needed something can not quite put my finger on it.  Will mess around some more the recipe to make it more to my liking.  Good thing about chili is you can change it to your liking.

As the character Ron Burgundy in the movie "Anchorman" put it, "I FRIGGIN' LOVE YOU!" This is an awesome, easy chili recipe that puts the "um" and the "oo" in comfort food. Best chili I've ever had and I'm very picky about food.

My variations include:
1 24oz can diced tomato + 1 24oz can crush tomato (substitute for 46oz tomato juice; just to make it a little thicker/richer)
3 Tblsp brown sugar (sub for white sugar)
2 teaspoons baking cocoa (1 tsp for each lb beef)
Red bell pepper (instead of green bell pepper)
Added a can of seasoned black beans
Added a packet of McCormick Taco Seasoning for more "oomph" without getting it too hot

Delicious!!!!  Made this for Super Bowl Sunday, and the bowls were licked clean! My husbands favorite because it's not overloaded with non sense ingredients and the flavor is amazing.  
I used V-8 Juice instead of tomato juice as mentioned.  I did not use green bell peppers (per husbands request) but I will next time. 
We added some jalapeno's to our individual bowls for those who wanted a punch.  This will be made many, many more times.
Thank you

This turned out really well. Instead of tomato sauce and tomato juice, I put in a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes. I put it in the slow cooker on high for four hours. I would say this makes 7 servings, not 10.

This was very tasty. I used ground venison in place of the beef. And after reading reviews of it being  soupy and thin I omitted the tomato sauce. I was also pretty scared of using 1/4 cup of chili powder. I started off with 2 Tbs. and figured I could add more if needed. But I was real happy with that amount. It wasn't too much for my small children. Cooking this for 90 min. was really key. It thickened up beautifully. I added about a cup or so of macaroni and turned it into chili mac. We enjoyed the flavor of the chili and didn't feel that it was too tomatoey. This is a really good base recipe that you can add or delete whatever your family likes.

This recipe was really good and I will make it again, but will add more meat next time. It definitely tasted better on the second day, rather than right from the stove.

I am a big believer in following recipes on this site to the "T" so that I can give it a very fair review. Well, I did follow this recipe exactly--didn't add anything or take away. Here are my results: TOO MUCH TOMATO JUICE! It literally tasted like hot tomato juice. The juice drowned out all the other things that were in the chili. I couldn't even tell you what the flavors were. If you did make this, I would say take away at least half of the tomato juice.

This was my first time making chili, but I have to say...this was the BEST chili I've ever had (no doubt thanks to this great recipe). I also added a bag of corn and slightly more onion and bell pepper than suggested. This recipe makes a lot of servings, so I tried cooking half of it in the slow cooker and half of it over a stove. If you're planning on cooking the chili in a slow cooker, I recommend that you use less liquid since the slow cooker won't allow for much evaporation (I just used 25 oz. tomato sauce and 29 oz. canned tomatoes in tomato juice). If you're just cooking over the stove, I think the recipe is perfect as is. Just for the heck of it, I also made this chili 100% organic. This is an awesome tasting and wholesome meal!

Look no further! This recipe is AWESOME as a base - I always get raves no matter how I modify. I don't drain the ground beef, however. I add things in my fridge like salsa, various hot sauces, etc.  I also use Taco Seasoning I (bill echols) from this site. If you can find Luck's Pinto beans (they have pork in them....yeah, I'm not helping anyone's cholesterol level), you will really take this recipe over the top. This chili gets better on day 2 or 3, too! You will never have a bad batch with this recipe as a start (or alone) ....I promise!

We really liked this chili recipe and like many other reviewers subbed different types of tomato mixes for the juice. I can't get juice here and I've never made my own. So, I used a can of stewed tomatoes that also has puree and a bottle of almost puree tomatoes. The spices were perfect for us and I will make again.

First off, I have had a favorite chili recipe from Whole Foods for a few years now - A Buffalo Chili which is VERY good.  However, as good as the Buffalo Chili is, it uses chipotle sauce, beef broth, spicy peppers, fire roasted tomatoes, etc. Creates a way different taste. Anyhow, tried this recipe and I made modifications and I am pretty happy -- The chili tastes great BEFORE being refrigerated over night. My modifications were: Worcestershire sauce, 1 lb of lean ground beef and a lb of tri tip roast (seared the roast, browned ground beef)which I shredded up after 8 hours,  shittake mushrooms, 3 cans of beans...2 red kidney, 1 black, brown sugar instead of white, crushed garlic, and I put my beans and shrooms in the last 15 minutes of slow cooking.  Slow cooked for 8 hours.  I LOVE the base of this recipe.  Anyway...very healthy recipe...chock full of fiber...Great suff, George...

I think this is a good recipe base, but it needs some tweaking.  I used the crockpot....I used less tomato juice & added a can of tomato paste & it was still a little thinner than I would like.  Used 1/2 as much chili powder and it was "medium" spicey.  Did not use cumin b/c I didn't have any.  Turned out pretty well. It was even better the 2nd day.  I will keep this recipe, but will be trying different variations until it's perfect!

I made this last night and my husband said it's the best chili so far. I did make a few changes: I substituted a can of petite diced tomatoes for the tomato juice - this made it a little thicker. I also browned the hamburger with 3 cloves of garlic and the chopped onions that the recipe called for. I cut half a jalapeno into tiny pieces and added a bit more cayenne because we like things spicy! I placed everything in the crockpot for 6 hours. Serve with sour cream, green onions,cheese and corn chips. Love this recipe.

I tripled this for a party and have never had such overwhelming praise for the food I served! I used ground turkey instead of beef and omitted the sugar, but other than that I followed everything exact. This is such a great recipe and pleased all ages from 4 y.o. to 70 y.o. The addition of the pinto beans is a great flavor. I have already made it several times and am planning on making it again soon! Thank you George, it is delicious!

It's Chili by George Haiku: "Bare bones, fine chili. Lots of room to customize. Didn't blow my mind." Anyone else notice that this is nearly identical to "Flatlander Chili", w/ the exception of celery? I chose to make George's, b/c well, there are 2 exclamation marks in the title, and that just made me smile. No insult to George's recipe, but as so many reviewers state, this is a basic chili - a nice stepping-stone from using store-bought chili-seasoning pouches, w/ plenty of room for personalizing. I halved the recipe for 1 lb. beef and followed the overall-agreement of reviewers who swapped tomato juice for crushed tomatoes. In the crockpot for 8 hrs. and served w/ cheese on top and a hunk of cornbread, yummy good chili on a chilly night, but didn't wow me. I'm on a neurotic mission to make as many chili recipes as there are on AR, so I'm glad that I can tuck George's!! under my belt.

I didn't make mine using the tomato sauce and opten for a large can of diced tomatoes instead.  However, for others concerned about the amount of liquid, just add a few Tbsp of tomato paste to thicken it up.  Also, I used 2 tsp of coriander and only 3 Tbsp of chili and cut out the sugar altogether (not needed).  Because I don't like the smell of beef while browning, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon (which has its own sweet flavour) and three cloves of garlic.  For those unsure about the veggies, you can use anything in there.  I always add 1 cup of frozen corn.  If you're adding mushrooms, make sure to watch out for the extra liquid :)

I LOVE this chili! Its perfect for cold days... warms you right up! I always add in black beans also, just because I love them, and sometimes add in some chopped jalepenos (when I'm feeling the need for some extra spicy. Overall though, this is GREAT and everyone loves it. It's even better leftover. Once you have it in the fridge for a day the flavors really come out.

This was ok.  It wasn't thick like regular chili.  There was too much of a tomato taste.  However after it sat a day or two in the fridge the flavor really came out.  I added curry and tumeric, and that gave it enough kick, but not so much that I wouldn't eat it (I am not a huge fan of kick).  I would look for another recipe before I tried to modify this to make it a thicker, less tomato tasting "chili."

This was an okay good chili. I expected it to be a bit spicier than it was, and to have more flavor based on all of the rave reviews. Probably won't make again.

This was very good!  The only things I did different was: 1.  used Bloody Mary mix for tomato juice, and only used 16 oz.  2.  Added two cans diced tomatoes with juices.  3.  Used 3 teaspoons brown sugar instead of 1/2 teaspoon white sugar.  I made this for a Superbowl party and everyone loved it!

This is DELICIOUS chili.  I used a 2# chuck roast cubed and browned in place of the ground beef and used a couple of cans of diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers and some extra sauce in place of the juice - and a couple of tbls of tomato paste to thicken it a smidge.  Cooked all day and served it at a family gathering with shredded cheddar on top and a corncake wedge on the side.  Super tasty, very easy, and enjoyed by all.  Thanks!

Great recipe. I make it pretty much as is. I omit the green pepper because I rarely have them, I use diced tomatoes instead of sauce and I don't measure, but I'm sure I use more spices than called for and I add garlic. YUM!

Easy and excellent Chili! Had all the ingredients on hand, which is a big plus too. Tasted as good as some chili's with tons of ingredients. 1/4 cup chili- powder was fine for our tastes, but my chili powder is on the mild side. So be aware, that could be very spicy, depending on your chili powder! I like chili with lots of dark red kidney beans and chunks of tomatoes, so felt I needed to add those. Maybe that is why mine was not too thin like others have reviewed it was. Will make again, soon... well... not too soon, it made a huge pot full! :)

We just finished up this absolutely YUMMY chili. I have to say that this is the absolute best chili I have ever tasted and I love chili. It was the perfect blend of spices. I didn't use the tomato juice, instead I used 23 oz of tomato sauce and one can of Rotel. I used one can of pinto beans (no other beans) and the spice blend as specified. I used about 1.5 lbs of hamburger. I also added 3 cloves of garlic. We topped it of with sour cream and cheddar/mont. jack chesses and OMG! what a fabulous and hearty dinner. This made 5 servings which was absolutely perfect for dinner for the two of us and even left enough for me to have some later. Thanks George for this awesome recipe!

I made this in the slow cooker.  It was delicious.  Just keep in mind this is a chili with more meat than beans!

This was my first experience making chili.  I am learning how to cook and I always thought chili would be hard to make.  Not this recipe, this was so easy and good!!  I improvised and used venison instead of hamburger meat.  Yum, Yum!!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe, George.

I make chili alot (1 particular recipe) but my husband likes this one better and my children really liked it. I usually make a sweet chili that I grew on but this one got high raves by my husband. I took most the suggestions and they were great. I actually only used 1 Ib of hamburger instead of 2 simply because I didn't want to use up that much meat for 1 meal. It was still very meaty. I sauted 1 1/2 cups of mixed white and red onion  (it's what I had on hand)in olive oil and added 4 cloves of garlic in the saute. I never used the tomato juice. I only put 2 cans of tomato sauce in and it was perfect. Not too juicy and not too meaty. I did not have pinto beans so I put in 2 cans of kidney beans instead. I also had no green pepper but added a can of diced tomatoes. Per suggestions, I used brown sugar instead of white. I prob. doubled up on all my seasonings. We like things tasty and with a kick so I especially added the cayenne pepper. I served with soup crackers, cheese, and sour cream. I used the crock pot and the flavors mixed so well together. The house smelled wonderful. SUPER easy and will prob. now make this my main chili recipe. THANK YOU GEORGE!

This recipe is as good as the Boiler Maker Tailgate Chili with half the work.  As indicated in a previous review, you truly can add other tomato products without ruining the chili.  I had forgotten the tomato juice and used pasta sauce and diced tomatoes and it tasted great.  I also doubled the spices and it was much better.

Added black beans instead of pinto beans. Also added minced garlic (5 cloves), chili flakes, vinegar (for acidity), 1 can of drained whole corn kernel, 1 whole chopped serrano chili pepper, and half diced red bell pepper. Added chopped tomatoes with juice to make it more hearty. Great taste and crowd pleaser.

My husband and I totally enjoyed it. It was a bit thin though. I added another can of kidney beans. Next time, I will decrease the tomato juice and add more peppers and onions. Also, I will brown the ground beef with garlic as another reviewer suggested. All in all, its a tasty and easy  basic recipe that I will use again.

Made this for a potluck and it was a hit!  I doubled all spices except cayenne and chili powder. Omitted the tomato juice and used 30oz of diced tomatoes with its juices instead. Cooked the beef with garlic, green bell pepper and onion before putting in crock pot. Cooked for 6 hours on low, then kept the pot on warm for another 12 hours until it was served. A perfectly spicy chili that was thick and flavorful.

I put this in the slow cooker all day and it came out wonderfully. I did sub tomato puree for the tomato juice b/c that's what I had on hand, but I'm glad I did since we like a thicker chili anyway. I also added a can of diced tomato with green chiles and doubled the chili powder and cumin. We topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream and everyone loved it! I halved this recipe and it still made a LOT, so I used the leftovers to make chili stuffed baked potatoes!

Today I was in the mood for Chili as we sat and watched the 9/11 10th anniversary coverage, it reminds me of the firefighters... Anyway I made some small adjustments because of preference and what I had.  I used 1lb ground beef cut the chili powder to 3T; l also had to make some substitutuions for the sauce; I didn't have tomato juice so I used water and beef broth and used 29 oz. of crushed tomatoes. :)

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!  Straight up.  I made a few modifications based on reading a few reviews.  I used 1 29 oz can of tomato sauce, two 16oz cans of diced tomatos and since a lot of people claimed it was too liquidy, I simply added two 6oz cans of Contadina tomato paste.  Great consistency since I don't like liquidy sauces, gravies, etc.  I used a whole onion and bell pepper, just cut down really well.  I also seasoned my ground beef before browning.  Makes a huge pot.  Ensure you consistently stir when you start boiling so it doesn't stick.  A large metal serving spoon worked best for me.  The plastic/rubber one didn't cut it.

Excellent chili recipe with compliments from my coworkers.  I omitted the green pepper and the black pepper for my taste and since I didn't have tomato juice, I used two cans of no-salt diced tomatoes and two cans of roasted diced tomatoes.  The spice level was between mild and moderate.  Next time I'm going to try adding beer.

Wow! Dee-licious!! This was my first attempt at making chili and it was fabulous!! I followed other reviewers advice and sauteed the onions with some garlic before throwing all ingredients in the pot. I also doubled the cumin and cayenne pepper. I added one extra can of pinto beans because I like a lot of beans in my chili. Lastly, instead of tomato juice, I substituted a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes (both were extras found in my kitchen). The result was fabulous. A hearty, delicious chili with a great flavor and a nice kick.

If you're a vegetarian looking for an easy recipe to tweak... look no further. I use black beans in place of the meat and replace some of the juice with diced tomatoes (sometimes with chilis) and a clove or so of garlic. I have made this many many times. I've also made it the original way w/ meat for my family and they love it.

I loved the consistancy of this chili from the tomato juice - can't wait to add it to my chili recipe but the taste was too bitter for me. I followed the recipe exactly - drives me crazy when people make changes and then post a review!

We love this chili recipe.  I use gr. turkey instead of the beef, add a bit more garlic, and use only great northern beans.  I always make a double recipe and freeze half!  One note-it is fairly spicy, so if you don't like much spice, cut back on the chili powder.

I cut down on the tomato juice (it was too soupy), and added a little more cayenne pepper, and it's great.

I have tried several other chili recipes on this site - both for on the stove and crockpot.  I made this in the crockpot and my family said "best chili you ever made Mom".  Deleted all the others - this is the keeper.  I followed recipe with the exception of the tomato juice I used diced tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer.  Thank you for submitting!

Great tasting and low sodium with a few changes.  My husband has a heart condition and it is hard to find recipes that are not loaded with sodium.  At the same time he complains about lack of flavor.  I used low sodium tomato juice and low sodium canned tomatoes.  I soaked and cooked the beans myself.  He actually complimented me on this chili and I liked it a lot.

After trying it the first time, we've changed it to be more to our personal tastes, agreeing with many reviewers that it was too bland.  Added chopped garlic, a can of rotel, and instead of tomato juice, Spicy V-8. We also have a pinto bean hater, and use double the kidney instead, and saute the onion with the beef for flavor.  This is a great base to try, especially if you've never made homemade chili before.  Then make changes until it's perfect for you!

Made the recipe as stated, except no tomato juice, because I didn't want it to be too watery, as some stated it was for them. I added diced tomatoes in juice instead. It had no flavor. Will not be making this again!

This was a great base for a chili and I am sure that made as written, it's delicious. My version used about a cup of diced red pepper, a can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and one bottle (32oz.) of Mrs.T's Bloody Mary mix in place of the tomato juice. everything else stayed the same. Very good! (also, I used 32 oz.of bloody mary mix and it's a fairly liquidy chili. The 46 oz. the recipe calls for will result in a very soupy chili. I bet you could get away with 24oz. if you want a thick chili)

The first thing my husband said was that it had no flavor. We kept adding seasoning. But in the end its taste was still just tomato. He said it was basically goulash. I didn't mind it, but not a bit hit over here. Won't make it again.

YUMMY!!  Used chunky tomato sauce and approx 30 oz of bloody mary mix.  Will Use spicy bloody mary mix next time, as the hubby feels it should have more spice to it.

Chili by George is a fabulous base to work with! I omitted the bell pepper, but added some fresh chopped garlic. I sauteed it in with my meat and onions. Like several other reviewers, I doubled some of the spices, substituted brown sugar for white, and used canned diced tomatoes in their own juice instead of plain tomato juice. It turned out great. I think this would be nice for a party or a chili cookoff. I usually prefer my chili pretty spicy so I may add even more cayenne next time, or maybe some fresh jalapenos or chilis to jazz it up. This was my first time attempting to make chili from scratch and I am very pleased with my results! Thank you all for your reviews as they were so helpful!!!

Made some adjustments based on what I like, but it's a great basic recipe that allows for personal preferences.  I added garlic with the beef/onions, used petite diced tomatoes, added black beans and a teaspoon of cocoa.  I also doubled all of the spices, except chili powder and salt.  Everyone liked it!

Used this recipe for a large group of 40 people. Was very good and everyone really enjoyed it. I did make a couple of additions ~ 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 tbsp ketchup & 3 tbsp worchester sauce. This gave it a deeper flavor. Two huge slow cookers full ~ nothing left over !! Best review when there isn't any left !!

Some of the best chili I've ever made. I did a half batch, so I used one pound of ground beef. I also used a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes and a can of mild Rotel in place of the tomato juice. I used 8 ounces of tomato sauce, a can of kidney beans, a can of chili beans, 3/4 cup of onion, no bell pepper, and the seasoning approximately as advised. I browned the ground beef on the stove and then threw everything into the crock pot. It went for around eight hours on low and it was amazing. Not too liquidy, and the spice level was perfect for me (I'm a wuss). Thanks for sharing, George!

Soooo good! I added a bit of brown sugar, about 2 Tbsp blackstrap molasses, minced garlic and a splash of Texas Pete hot sauce. I used 2 cans of V-8 and would not omit that.

Great Chile! Substituted tomato juice with Beef Broth, added approximately 1/3 cup ketchup, thickened with a small can of tomato paste, and finally added an extra 1/2 teaspoon cumin, salt, and black pepper. Enjoy!

This chili was very good and especially easy in the crockpot.  Instead of the tomato juice, I substituted a large can of tomatoes and another large can of tomato sauce and increased the green pepper to 1 1/2 c of medium sized chunks to match the chunks I cut of the onion.
  I also browned 1" cubes of chuck roast and pork roast and added those.  I left out the cayenne pepper and in it's place, I added sliced pepperoni which gave it a subtle kick.

My family and our guests loved it!  I added an additional 2 cans of beans (for a total of 4: dark red kidney, light red kidney, white kidney and pinto - all drained and rinsed).  Also, I used approximately 46 oz of diced tomatoes (undrained) in place of the tomato juice and one 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce plus one 14.5 oz can of spaghetti sauce for the 29 oz of tomato sauce (using what was in my pantry).  Because of using the spaghetti sauce, I omitted the sugar and oregano.  I browned and drained the beef then combined all the ingredients in my crock pot and cooked on high for about 3-4 hours.  The chili was delicious as made and also over elbow noodles for chili-mac.  When I make it again, I will continue to use the diced tomatoes in place of the juice as we were very happy with the consistency with my alterations.  Next time, I may add one more can of beans (for a total of 5) as there was plenty of room in the beef/tomato/bean ratio and it helps to stretch the budget!  Looking forward to freezing the left-overs for a fast dinner when the baby comes!

I agree with the last poster... this is a very heavy chili.  The second time I made it, I decided to use it as a base as the spicing is just excellent.    To lighten it up, I add 2 chopped carrots, 2 chopped celery stalks, 2 cans of mixed beans (with liquid), a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and a quarter cup of chopped parsley.  If I have mushrooms or red peppers, I usually chop those and throw them in as well. The additional beans and vegetables transform this dish and it gets rave reviews.   It's a good base recipe- hence the 3 stars.

Freakin the best chili I think I have ever had!  Used three small cans of stewed tomatoes and one crushed instead of tomato juice.  This IS NOT spicy...I wish someone would have said that, b/c w/ 1/4 C of chili powder I thought it would be, cut it wasn't.  Served w/ fritos, sour cream, and shredded cheese...big hit!

This is an excellent chili.  It's become one of our church's favorite dish in the winter months.  We added diced green chili's, Chipolte seasoning, and cook half gound beef and half stew meat.  Everyone loves it

I made this today for dinner and it was really good. The only thing is it tasted a lot like tomato soup, so next time I will use diced tomatoes in their own juice instead of the juice. Next time I will also cook it in the slow cooker, I think it will be better that way.

This turned out exceedingly well - I didn't get the big tomato juice, but went with smaller cans and complimented that with diced tomatoes and green chiles. This is a great slow-cook chili receipe that you can make in the morning and forget until dinner time. Will definitely make again!

I made this in my crockpot and pretty much followed the recipe other than i used half ground venison and half ground beef. I also had no tomatoe sauce or tomatoe juice,so I used a can of tomatoe soup and a large can of Italian chopped tomatoes. There are only 4 of us and I thought we would have plenty of leftovers, but between lunch and dinner it was all gone!! So easy and so good!!!

I think this is a good base recipe that requires some tweaking by each cook to make it suit their taste.  I've been making the Fantastic Black Bean Chili on this site for years and love it, but decided to give this recipe a shot for the sake of trying something new.  I used turkey instead of beef and (as per some of the suggestions here) stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato juice.  In the end, I thought the texture of the chili was great, but it was too salty (??) and a bit too tomato-y for me.  I missed the beans that I enjoy so much in the other chili recipe. Next time I'll reduce the salt and cut back some on some of the tomatoes.  This is a good recipe to experiment with and really make your own.

This recipe is fantastic!!  My husband and I couldn't get enough.  As per other reviewers, we added brown sugar instead of white sugar, a large can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice and Tabasco sauce to taste.  We also added hot chili pepper seasoning.  Thank you so much George, as we now have added this to one of our family favorites!!

ive got a reasonable tolerance to spicy food but this chili was way too much.. i cant even eat it

the flavor (what i can taste over the hot) is good enough.. i even added extra beans and tomato sauce to it to tone it down, cheese and sour cream on top of the serving and its still too hot...

ill keep looking for that ideal chili recipe though im almost scared to try any more now after this because no one even thought to mention how spicy it might be to some people.

I cut the spice by a LOT to make it super mild for my kids ... and it is the ONLY chili my children will eat.  My daughter LOVES it - she had 3 bowls of it.  Now THAT's a chili recipe for me!

(I used leftover turkey and black beans the last time I made it and it was still a hit.)

The first time I made this recipe I listened to some other reviewers and used 3 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. This time, I followed the recipe to a T. It was MUCH better this time around. I definitely recommend following the recipe, this is a delicious chili, the best I have ever made!!!

I've made this 3 times now.  I make it in the crock pot, putting everything in in the morning and letting it go all day.  I modify just slightly by using a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice.  Served with cornbread muffins, this is very easy and is AWESOME good stuff.  Thanks!

I made this chili in a slow cooker on high in half the time. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. It is actually much better the next day once it has taken on its full flavor. Not to spicy for even the biggest wimps add some fire with cholula sauce for great flavor. Top with grated mexican cheese blend, sour cream and oyster crackers. I'll make this one again many times.

Perfect chili! Now I know why it has so many reviews. I almost cheated and used a chili seasoning packet instead of the suggested spices and I'm so glad I didn't, it's great the way it is. I've searched a long time for a recipe and I will make this over and over again.

Great feedback from our party guests, but instead of tomato juice and sauce I used a can (15oz) of diced tomatoes, 15 oz of crushed tomatoes in puree and a little paste for thickness. Also, I took another users advice with 2 Tbsp of chili podwer instead of the 1/4 cup. I used the crock pot.. and for this first time chili maker....I will make it again! Next time minus the meat to be more heathly!

I really struggled with this chili recipe. I had to do a lot of "tweaking" to make it good. I guess as a personal preference, I just like chunkier/thicker chili. I started out following the recipe and did not like the results - too acidic and the chili powder was too overbearing. Then I added a can diced tomatoes with green chilies, a can of stewed tomatoes, a can of black beans, another can of kidney beans, lots of garlic, some T.S. onion-onion seasoning, a bit of cocoa, and another tablespoon or so of sugar. Next time I will substitute v-8 for the tomato juice, cut the juice quantity in half, and add 2 cans of diced tomatoes from the beginning - along with the extra beans and seasonings I added this time.

I didn't have all ingredients, otherwise I'd probably rate this 5 Stars.  I omitted salt, didn't have cayenne pepper nor tomato jc, and not enough tomato sauce.  Used 15 oz tomato sauce, and 14.5 oz diced tomatoes (undrained).  Slow cooker for 2.5 hours, on high.  Chili wasn't 'thin/runny.'  Topped with thawed frozen yellow corn for some crunch & bright color.  Could taste the chili powder, but didn't notice oregano & cumin--probably subtle flavours you're not supposed to notice but which makes all the difference to this dish :)  This review just for FYI if you need to improvise.

I listened to what other people wrote and cut down a lot on the juice.  It was good but it turned out really sweet, even though we cut down on the sugar as well.

This was SOO easy and came out PERFECT!!  It was the first time making chili for my family and so I was a little worried.  I went to the store but could not find Cayenne pepper anywhere !!, so I did some looking and found that using 4 drops, (NOT SHAKES, DROPS) of Tabasco was a perfect substitute for the cayenne pepper.  Like I said, came out perfect.  Not too spicy and definitely not bland either.  My whole family started asking the very next day when I would make it again.

This is a good base recipe to be used for customization. As is, it's bland and spiceless, like a thick spaghetti sauce with beans. The texture is nice, so adding spice is a must as well as your prefered veggies.

I am a fan of only rating a recipe if it's been followed, otherwise you're rating a different recipe. I followed this exactly and it's incredible.  I was surprised at the flavor it had and for how little time it took to throw together.

Very good chili. Do not use as much tomato juice as it called for, other than that made as is.

Great chili!! I served it to my family and everyone loved it... so there's 4 reviews!! lol This recipe is great for people that wanna develop their own style with chili, it's a wonderful base. Not to say it doesn't stand on it's own, it does perfectly. I'd added a little chocolate into mine and it gave a richness in the background that was nice. Next time I'd like to used my own canned products. I made speghetti to go under it and a moist cornbread to go with it. It was all a chili-licious great time!!

This was a good standard chili. It taste like any other chili I have had. Not to say it was bad because it was pretty good. Just did not have anything that made it more special then any other chili. I made it in the slow cooker and followed the recipe exactly except I added some cornstarch at the end as it was a little runny for my taste. One of my guest thought it was too spicy but no one else did so I think that was just them.

Fabulous, and oh so easy!! Disclaimer: I did substitute spicy bloody mary mix (as someone mentioned) just b/c I like things with extra kick (didn't use nearly as much liquid as called for) - other than that, followed to a T! Earned serious cool points with my dad-in-law who tapped into the chili before I got home...I actually think he has a new-found respect for me now! (it only took 20 years...??) Thanks, George! : )

I have used this recipe many times and have even won my companies Chili Cook Off with it.  I do make some edits though. I don't use the tomato sauce or tomato juice.  I substitute Bloody Mary mix, Southwest salsa, and some tomato paste. I double the sugar and also add garlic. I also cut the chili powder by a 1/3. My last batch I added roasted red peppers and it tasted pretty good. Lastly, I have been using the frozen chopped onions and peppers because it is easier and I haven't noticed a difference in taste.  This is my favorite chili recipe. Thanks, George!

I broke the cardinal rule of cooking only trusted recipes to feed guests, and in my case 50 people, and I took a gamble and it turned out great! Thankyou for sharing your recipe and for everyone who voted and commented.  I tweaked it just a little because my mother in law knows a-lot about good food, and she recommended I add some tomato diced with green chilies. Oh and my husband lives black beans so we added some of those too.  Fantastic!

I've made this recipe a few times, and love it. The only thing I did differently than the directions say to do, is I sauteed the onion and green pepper with the burger while browning it. This one is a keeper.

I've used this recipe for years and love it.  I've tweaked it to suit my tastes by adding 1 lb of hot sausage and 1 lb of ground beef, a lot of cayenne pepper and sometimes corn.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.  A must try.

This recipe is outstanding! My first time making chili and it was DELICIOUS. I  added two cans of drained diced tomatoes, two cans of pinto beans, and one can of kidney beans. I also added a little more cayenne pepper. Top with cheese and oh so good!

I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it. I used the modifications suggested by other users: added 1 tsp garlic, 1 tbsp of brown sugar instead of white and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice. They said if I entered it in the local chili cook-off, it would win. It was delicious!

The reason I am giving this a 3 is because I made some changes because of peoples comments.  Instead of tomato juice I used bloody mary mix.  I also added  some chipotle and adobo, 3 cloves garlic, a can of crushed tomatoes, a square of dove dark chocolate and some crushed red pepper flakes.  I think this is a good base chili recipe :)

Not only was this chili recipe delicious and better than the one I curently use, the aroma emanating from the crock during a cold and snowy winter day was a pleasant addition. I added mushrooms and hot sausage.

This has become my Go To base for chili. Of course I always make small changes as I go based on what I have on hand and I have learned that 1/4 cup of chili powder is definitely too much for us. We like about a small non heaping Tbsp of chili powder. I also use diced petite tomatoes and one can of Rotel © to make up the tomato juice because we prefer a thick chili with small prices of tomato throughout. But if you adjust for heat preference and tomato type preference you cannot go wrong with this as your base. I like to add a small shake of
cinnamon and a tsp of cocoa at the end of cooking to finish it. My husband adds a splash of vinegar to his bowl and my granddaughter likes sour cream added so you can use this in multiple ways. I also use beans because we like beans in our chili. I prefer one can of chili beans and one can of kidney beans myself and will sometimes add Bushes baked beans in different types depending on what I have in the cabinet. This recipe really is the perfect base for chili & I can always find it due to my dad's name being George! Lol. Thank you George for writing down the perfect base for me to have awesome chili whenever I feel like it!

Very good and versatile recipe, easy to tailor perfectly to taste. I use 1 lb beef and an extra can of beans, low sodium spicy V8 and lots of good quality chili powder. It's always dependable and delicious. The V8 juice is such a great shortcut! I've made it at least ten times, it's my go to chili recipe.

This recipe is far too soupy.  The tomato flavor from the juice overwhelms a lot of the other flavors as well.

My BF made this for me the other day. He was going to follow it exactly, but I was the one who asked him not to put 1/4 cup of chili powder in it because it seemed like way too much for my taste, and I was right. He only used like 2 tbsp. I believe, and it was more than enough for us. Two cans of beans wasn't enough, so he added two more cans and it still came out a little watery, so next time we will cut back on the tomato juice some. Otherwise, we really liked it. Thanks.

Only change I make when I use this is used either canned whole plum tomatoes in place of the juice, or canned diced tomatoes. It's by far the best chili I have tasted. Got 3rd place at a chili cook off with this, and I was out of chili 2 hours before it was over(peoples choice). I love this more than any other chili! I add extra onion and green pepper too.

I followed this recipe pretty much exact, except for adding a little more ground beef and a tad extra spices...Overall, it turned out really well...Even tasted better the next day for lunch after all the flavors molded together.

Very good and so easy. I did not use tomato juice,not a fan but used one cup of beef broth. Also did not have pinto so used black beans as the second bean. Through in a diced jalapeno pepper for some extra kick.  Was careful not to use all of the seeds, just enough to give it additional heat.  Really basic and a good base to alter to individual tastes.

Great basic chili. Not too sweet or spicy with a medium amount of both beef and beans. I followed the recipe exactly and made it in my crock pot. I will probably make this again but with less tomato juice as the chili was slightly more liquid than I like but I prefer very little liquid in my chili.

I have used this recipe as my standard for a few years.  My kids and I loved it, but my husband did not.  One day I asked him to pick up the ingredients at the store and he bought chili beans and a smaller bottle of tomato juice (1 quart).  That version he loved!  It was thicker and was less tomato-y. I rate both versions 5 stars.

This chili is very good. I have made it 2 times now. The first time, I made a 1/2 recipe. The only thing I changed was the type of beans, I had black bean and navy in the house, and used the whole cans for half the recipe. I thought using tomato juice is what made this better than other bean chili recipes I usually try. I also thought the doubling of the beans was a good tweak. That time, it made about 4-5 servings. With half the recipe, I only needed to simmer it about 45 minutes too. The second time I made it, I decided to go with the full recipe and my dutch oven pot wouldn't fit it all. I ended up having to divide it between 2 different pots. I used a 94% lean beef the second time an 85% beef from whole foods the first time. I liked the higher content fat beef for this chili, which is usually not the case with most recipes. This is my new go to recipe for chili. ty

Yum. We did tweak this: Can't have chili without tomatoes proper, so we sub'd in 2 cans (~54oz) diced tomatoes for the juice (left the sauce as is). Also added 2 jalapenos, doubled the cayenne.

I made this last night, but converted it to "Beanless Turkey Chili". It was delicious. I used the recipe as is, but obviously switched to ground turkey. I doubled all of the spices except the chili powder, and added 5 cloves of minced fresh garlic. I used 3 tbs of brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons of tsarachi chili sauce. Served over macaroni with sour cream and cheese, yum!

Awesome recipe. I add another can of beans and a can of chopped tomatoes, use half the tomato paste, and after the meat is brown, when it is draining, I saute the bell pepper, onion and garlic. Once they're sauteed, I add the chopped tomatoes, all the seasonings and then the rest of the ingredients.

Just made this chili for a New Year's Day get together and it was easy and delicious!  By far the best chili I have ever made!  The recipe made a ton so we froze some and are eating the leftovers still.  On Day #3 now and the flavors just keep getting better, the longer it sits!

Very good basic chili recipe.  I only used 1 can of beans and replaced the tomato juice with 1 large can of crushed tomatoes, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  We really enjoyed this as our new years dinner.  Thanks George!

Great basic recipe with items you can find in your pantry. I thought that the chili was better the next day, after the flavor melded in and it thickened up a bit.  The only addition I would suggest is to thicken up the chili with a flour/water mixture and simmer in at the end. The flavors were really good!

Excellent recipe :-) Even my b/f who doesn't like chili loved it.  The only modification I did was that I used 1/8 cup of chili powder and 1/8 cup of jalapeno powder, we like it spicy!

My family loved this chili! I used 2 cans of kidney beans instead of a can of pinto beans(I didn't have any) and it was great. My picky teenagers even came back for seconds and begged me to make it again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I halved the recipe so only used 1 can kidney beans and no pinto.  I used 1/2 chopped green pepper and I had to add a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes because we like tomato chunks in our chili.  I cooked in the slow cooker and it was great.  Next time I would saute the onions and peppers with the ground beef.  We liked the tomato juice in this recipe.

I really liked this recipe.  I used 1 1/2lbs of beef, one pint of stwed tomatos, 40oz of tomato juice, one can each of lite and dark kidney beans, rather than pinto beans.  I ommited gr pepper and cayenne.  I made corn bread and had left over corn so I threw that in too.  The rest of the recipe I left alone.  I topped withe cheese and sour cream.  Love, love, loved this.

Love this chili. I'm sensitive when it comes to spicy food and this recipe is spicy enough to satisfy my husband but not so spicy I can't enjoy! I continue to make this recipe over and over. I also love that there isnt chunks of tomatoes. I'm not a fan. It's just the perfect recipe for me and my family. I always make corn bread on the side.

A great recipe base that I just had to mix up a little.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Instead of the tomato juice, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I also sauteed 2 cloves of garlic (minced) with the turkey while it was browning.  I used 1/32 teaspoon of pure stevia extract instead of the sugar, and added 2 Tablespoons of cocoa powder and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  
I covered it while it simmered for 45 minutes (stirring occasionally) and it was amazing!!
I added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl and my kids all loved it!

First time I have ever made chili and it exceeded my expectations. I usually cook a large batch of something and eat it all week, it tasted awesome even after 5 days! Instead of using chili powder though I use Bloemer's chili powder mix, and cut out the salt since the chili powder mix already has some in it. I also added some angel hair pasta.

Very good Chili Recipe!!!! I actually thought it was ok with the tomato juice.  I had never made it with tomato juice and thought it would be too soupy, but it actually wasn't.  Simmering it for an hour and a half is definitely the key! Thanks for the recipe George!

Thank you, George, for this wonderful chili recipe.  I've used it several times, each with it's own different add-ins (like bacon, cut up tomatoes, white beans, red peppers, etc) and it turns out supurb every time.  I'm making two batches now, one to freeze for later.

This is so easy.  I kicked it up a notch by doubling up the cayenne, chili powder, oregano and cumin.  I also added a pound of ground pork to give it a little more flavor.  Otherwise, I would classify this chili as no fail.

Great recipe. Followed Luv2Cook recipe. But I used one can of Rotel, and once can diced tomatoes. Made it in slowcooker. Cooked for 8 hrs. I wish I used one can of tomato paste to thicken it up a little bit. Browned the beef first w/ 3 cloves garlic and one medium yellow onion. Thanks for the recipe. It is in my recipe box.

I've eaten a lot of chili in my time and this is by far the very, very best.  I wish I could give it more stars!  I made two modifications.  I substituted 2 - 14 ounce cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato juice and I added a 6 ounce can of tomato paste.  I browned the beef beforehand and sauteed the onions.  Put it all into the slow cooker on High and cooked it for five hours. And promptly ate two large bowls.

UPDATE: MY PARENTS LOVED THIS! I'M ESPECIALLY PLEASED SINCE THIS IS PREFECT FOR MY DAD'S HEART-RESTRICTIVE DIET. Eh. This was allright. There's certainly nothing wrong with this...it's just not to my liking, I guess. For one, I felt this was terribly bland (my hubs and I like heat). George's chili had absolutely NO heat and very little flavor. Maybe this is because I subbed ground turkey  for beef (it was by far cheaper to do sp - lean beef was $4.50 per 1.25 lbs. and turkey was $1.39 per 1 lb. roll). My hubby attributed our bowlfuls of bland chili to my subsitution, but I'm not totally convinced he's right lol. I do think beef is more flavorful, but  not enough so to make THAT much of a difference. My only other change was to use all dark kidney beans (pinto beans don't belong in chili, IMHO). I followed George's cooking diretions to the letter and didn't feel that my chili was too "soupy" at all. Bottom line: If I were to make this again, I'd up the spices, add some chili seasoned diced tomatoes (to add some much needed bulk) and use beef instead of turkey. I'd still use my slow cooker, even on lazy weekends. Why slave over the stove when you have an appliance that will do the work for you??? Anywhoo, this was good, but not GREAT. I gave the leftovers to my parents who have milder palates. Thanks anyways, George! :-)

This made an excellent bowl of chili.  I did this recipe in a slow cooker and cooking it on the stove top just doesn't compare.  I did make a few minor changes.  I only used 32 oz of tomato sauce to not make it so watery, I only used kidney beans and no pinto beans, and I used 2 packets of McCormick chili seasoning and added the sugar and oregano to it.  I waited to add salt and pepper at the end of cooking as needed bc packets have salt and pepper in them.  Will use this recipe agaiin!

It tasted great.  I made it in a crockpot.  It was a lot thinner than what I was hoping; think next time will substitute some of the juice or sauce for some diced tomatoes and more beans.  It freezes very well, too.  Saucy or not, used it to make Frito Pie and it was good.

So good! I made mine in the slowcooker cooked on high for about hours. I didn't measure the veggies - I used an entire onion, a stalk of celery and two red peppers. Instead of the tomato juice, I used two 28oz cans of diced tomatoes and used one small can of tomato sauce (14oz?). I used a measuring spoon to measure out the seasonings, but they were all kind of heaping, so I used a little more than the written amounts. I also used two cans of kidney beans because I didn't have any pinto beans and also added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I used 1/2 the amount of salt just because and it was fine. It makes a HUGE portion which is great because I won't have to cook tomorrow or worry about lunch for 2 days! Served with fresh baked whole wheat bread. Will make again.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I think it needs many tweaks to be perfect.  First, the original calls for way too much liquid if you are cooking the slow cooker.  I recommend two cans of diced tomatoes with juice and the one can of sauce, and that's it.  It does thicken after cooking so you don't have to add cornstarch or flour or anything.  Also, this isn't spicy enough by half!  I added four chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, and a full tsp. of cayenne, and this was just right.  The 1/8 tsp. is waaaaay to little.  Also I don't know if it's me but I think brown sugar works better than white.  All in all like other reviewers have said this is a good starter recipe, but I would recommend people to add and subtract to their personal tastes.

This was not difficult to make and my family liked it. It was quite liquidy compared to my usual chili recipe, even though I din't put the full amount of juice in. I used vegetable juice cocktail instead of straight tomato juice and the flavour was good. Thanks!

I used one pound of hamburger instead of two and I added a can of dice green chilies.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  I am going to use the leftovers for chili dogs tonight. YUM YUM

This recipe is the best chili I've ever made, the only change I made was totally accidental. I bought store brand tomato juice which I noticed as I was pouring it in the pot was actually vegatable juice, I'm sticking with the veggie juice because this was so awesome!

If I could rate this 30 million stars I would. I added a few things to this the couple times I've made it (zucchini, salsa, cooked mushrooms). It's the best chili ever. When I cook it for my family I have to cut down a lot on the spice because they can't take it, but I put extra in mine :). Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I debated even writing a review for this because there are so many already, but decided what the heck.  This is the best and easiest chili recipe I have ever used!  I browned the ground beef and then threw everything in the crock pot overnight (about 9 hours).  I used a large can (about 28 oz?) of diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice and I think that was a wise substitution.  It would have been way too soupy otherwise.  Other than that change I followed the recipe to a T.   Thanks George!

I made this in my slow cooker for our big family gathering.  It was a big hit.  Very yummy!  I used half the amount of tomato soup and tomato sauce (because I couldn't fit it in my slow cooker) and it wasn't too thick or too thin.  It was perfect.

I followed this recipe exactly and was disappointed. I like my chili thick and hearty and this is more like chili soup. The flavor is great just needs to be thicker. I will add some crushed tomatoes next time.

I followed the suggestion of another reader and used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. I entered in my work's Chili Cookoff and won! Very easy to make.

George, your chili is insanely good! I used what I had on hand. One 15 oz can of tomato sauce, two 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes,  1 lb ground beef, one small can of tomato paste, 1 can of kidney beans, 1 can chili beans, 1 can white beans. Added a touch more cayenne pepper for more heat. I sauteed onion and lots of minced garlic. Cooked the ground beef and drained the grease. Threw everything into a bowl and put it in the fridge overnight. The next morning, I put the chili in my crockpot and let it cook on low for 9 hrs while I was at work. The house smelled fantastic! Nothing goes better with chili than cornbread, and dinner was on the table. Thank you for such a tasty, easy meal.

This was great! Had crushed tomatoes on hand that replaced the juice, but have no doubt that almost any tomato base would give an awesome result.  The quantities and spices are just wonderful, I have tried a variety of chili recipes from allrecipes that were okay, but all seemed to be missing something....my searching has ended and this will be my go-to recipe, everybody just loved it and we gladly gobbled up all the leftovers :)

I'm rating it 5 stars because my child and BF both really liked it.  The only changes I made were: No onions....I used onion powder instead.  No green pepper because neither one of us really like it and I didn't have any.  Other than that, I followed it to the T.  It was good, but nothing OUTSTANDING, in my opinion.  I most likely will make this again since they both seemed to really like it.  I'm just saying...it was GOOD, but nothing that would really kick me in the arse and make me take notice.

This is a great basic, old fashioned recipe! I have made it similarly for years. I use 2 cans of kidney beans and don't use pinto beans.   I use only a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce. In addition to the tomato juice I put in 2 large cans of diced tomatoes. What is chili without tomatoes? I use chili powder, onions, garlic, pepper, green peppers and bay leaves to flavor it.   For those of you who whine about it being too runny, it's supposed to be this way, it's not a thick yucky con carne. I love crackers in mine!

I have made this a few times, it is easy to make and customizable.  I usually follow it completely and the results are excellent.  I have even won a chili cook off at work with this (about 10 other entries) for that one I added a regular sized can of corn for added color and texture, GOOD STUFF!!!

I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of red meat, and was a little hesitant to make this at home with my husband.  But to my surprise, I had a bowl of it and it was spectacular.  It was spicy, but not overpowering; and the meat flavor was not dominating either.  Really nice chili :)  I served it with a blend of shredded Mexican cheeses, a tablespoon of soup cream and lots of cilantro.  Delicious.

I have to admit that I'm one of those people that bought the little chili packages that you mix in with some ground beef and beans and service it as chili. Well, no more of that nonsense. This recipe wasn't only delicious, it was easy! I made it in my crock pot, browning the meat first then mixing everything in the crock pot and setting it at low for 8 hours. Oh, I did substitute the tomato juice for a 29oz can of crushed tomato and a 15oz can diced tomato. I though the tomato juice would make it to thin and I wanted a nice thick chili. I froze the leftovers and will update about how it turned out when we eat it.

This was my first chili that I have attempted and it came out fantastic! I made it for a Superbowl party and it was a huge hit! I added a little Worcestershire sauce and a jalapeno to give it a little kick and garnished with oyster crackers and shredded cheddar cheese. Next time I would add more kidney and pinto beans and maybe a can of chopped or fresh tomatoes. Will definitely make this one again.

This is the first beef chili I've ever made that turned out fantastic.  I've tried chili before in the past to only have to throw out the whole batch, a waste of time and money.  I highly recommend this and tweak it to your liking.

THIS CHILI IS AMAZING! My husband and I don't like onions or peppers, so i just used onion powder and omitted the peppers. I also added a little more chili powder than called for, as well as pepper, and used dry pinto and red beans instead of canned. I tried one other recipe from this site before, and it was VERY dull, but this recipe was very flavorful. I made bread bowls and served in in those, HUGE HIT!

When I make this everyone says it is the best chili they have ever had!!  I don't add green pepper but a large can of diced green chilis.  Also canned diced tomatoes with juice instead of just tomato juice.  Seasoning is perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe George!!

My family LOVES this chili! My father in law said this is the best chili he's ever eaten.  I've been married 11 years and this is the ONLY dish he's ever complimented.  I have a veggie husband so I leave the meat out of his or use veggie burger.

I am actually NOT a fan of chili at all, but this is delish!  My husband and I make a batch for ten and change it up a little by using 1/2 V8 Spicy tomato juice for that part of the recipe. Also, instead of beans, we chop potatoes into small pieces.  Before adding the potato, we take half out and freeze it.  DELISH topped with cheese and Fritos.

Very good!  Like many others, I omitted the tomato juice and replaced it with the same amount of diced/stewed tomatoes.  I doubled the recipe as well to have some to freeze. As an experiment, I did one pot on the stove simmering for 2 hours, and one pot was prepared in the crock pot, simmering for 7 hours. The crock pot produced thicker chili and the beans and beef were softer. I think it's definitely worth the time to use a crockpot if you can.   It's perfect as is for a day when the temps didn't get out of the 30s!  Enjoy!

This was pretty good Chili. I agreeded with the other reviewers that it had too much juice in it, so I cut that way back. I made this for a friend and her family.  She's been sick, I've been helping out, and wanted something I know they liked.  I got rave reviews from the whole family, and they wanted the recipe.  Since it makes so much, we snuck a couple of bowls before I took it over, and my son and I thought it was really good too.  You can't go wrong with this one.  Good job George!!

yum! It's the only chili I make. I add crushed red pepper to give it an extra kick and use less tomato juice also so it's thick. I throw it all in the crock pot and chomp it all week long! Oh, cook the meat before throwing it in the crock pot of course!!!!!yummmmmmmmm!

It was okay.. it was only a little better than canned chili. I doctored it up quite a bit, but it still didn't really taste great. I used cut up steak, in addition to the ground beef, 2 more cans of kidney beans, a can of diced tomatoes, and used less tomato juice than called for... and it was still runny. I added quite a bit more cayenne pepper, I just don't know what I did wrong, it wasn't great. With a little cheddar and sour credam on top, it was okay. I don't think I'll be making this again. Sorry..

I tested this recipe for a small dinner party and my family and guests loved it. I made a triple batch for our annual Halloween Party (renaming it "Double Double Toil and Chili" for the occasion). 30 guests LOVED having this warm, filling chili before an evening of trick or treating. I stuck with the original recipe, cooked it in crock pots both times, and made sweet corn bread on the side. FABULOUS CHILI!

All I can say is WOW!  My 5 year old who only eats chicken nuggets and pasta, LOVED this.  He even asked for seconds, which he has never done before.  I did make a few changes, based on what I had on hand.  Instead of tomato juice I used 2 cans of tomato paste and 5 cups of beef broth.  Yummy.

This was awesome!! The only change I made was to double the cayenne pepper and use a can of whole tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. Perfect!

I know good chili and this is outstanding chili!  I added 3 cans of diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice; added a couple cloves of garlic and a small can of green chilies.  For those who want more heat, just add a few red pepper flakes to the individual bowls.  So much better than the chili seasoning packets at the store.

Easy to make and even easier to eat! As a member suggested, this chili is yummy on baked potatoes! Just 2 of us, so I froze my leftovers for an upcoming cold winter evening!!  Thanks George!

Chili is such a subjective food, everyone has their preferences. This is a very good chili recipe. The only changes I made are I added the spices to taste and I went with 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground Italian sausage. Also used brown sugar instead of white. Yummy!

The spices in this chili are great.  This will be the chili recipe I always use from now on.  My boyfriend loved it.  I did substitute the tomato juice for tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes.  I like my chili a little bit thicker.  YUM!!

Wow - we loved this!  The only change I made was to add a can of green chilis and some red pepper flakes (we like it a little spicier).  I served this over noodles with some shredded cheddar on top - wonderful!!!

Yummy, Yum, Yum!! Super easy recipe and very gOod!!! I did add/change a couple things, first I halved the recipe beacuse I do not have very many mouths to feed ...I did not have tomato juice so I used a can of diced tomatoed as other users suggested also I added the onions as I was browning the beef and added some garlic as well. I also added a lot more cayenne cause I like my chili really spicy! I didn't measure how much cayenne I added...just dumped a bunch in. Also, I left out the bell peppers simply because I don't care for them. It was really soupy at first but by the time the 1 1/2 hours went by it was perfectly thickened!! I will definitley be making this again and again...bye bye packs of chili mix!!! I can't wait to have the left overs for lunch! ThanXx!!!!~

This chili was good. I listened to reviews and added 1/2 of the v8 juice and added 2 14 oz cans of stewd tomatoes. I ended up only having an 8 oz can of tomatoe sauce. I used the 8 oz can of tomatoe sauce, 6 oz can of tomatoe paste and another can of stewed tomates. It still turned out really good. I like a chunky chili anyways. I also added garlic,a can of black beans, and 1 tbsp brown sugar instead of white. Delicious!!!!

Tasty!  Easy chili recipe and a "4" as written.  Have made this a couple of times and find it's better  with a few cloves of minced garlic and simmered longer - about 3 hours - to thicken.  Like other reviewers I like my chili with some tomatoes so I used a combination of crushed and diced tomatoes and skip the tomato juice.  Brown sugar instead of white adds another element to the flavor.

I loved this Chili.  I changed a couple of things very slightly though.  I added a can of diced roma tomatoes because I generally like noticeable pieces of tomotoes in things like chili or spaghetti sauce.  I wasn't able to find pinto beans at my grocery store canned on their own so ended up with a mixture:  1 can of kidney beans, one small can of brown beans in tomato sauce and one small can of mixed beans-kidney and pinto.  The mixture was nice.  I also ended up using V* rather than plain tomato juice as that's what i had in  my pantry.  I added about a half cup of celery, which my younger sister was pretty keen on.  The leftovers are in my freezer labelled as Jen and Meagan's super, fantastic awesome Chili!

We really liked the chili.

This chili was fantastic.  It was my first time making chili and it was extremely easy.  I'm kind of a baby when it comes to spicy stuff, but this recipe had just the right amount of heat.  It was a little bit soupier than I'm used to, but once we mixed tortilla chips in it was fine.  My boyfriend raved about it, and I'm about to email the recipe to my mom.  Thanks, George!

I tried this recipe, and it was FANTASTIC!!  Thank you so much.  I like how people post on the changes they made to the recipe because I can review their changes, and make it how I like it.

I, too, used 2 cans of Tomato paste, with the Tomato sauce, instead of using tomato juice.  I added a little more of all the seasonings, and added red pepper, and a large can of diced tomatoes...this chili was the bomb!  And it was nice and thick..not soupy.  I also tried it on a hot dog with onions and mustard!  Mmmm  Mmmm!  Thank you again!  --green

Loved this chili. It was different from the way I normally make it but that's what I was looking for. Very chunky, hearty and robust. This is perfect for a cold winters day. Didn't find it necessary to make any changes except I also used the chopped tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. I think it would've worked great either way though. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks George!!

I put this up in the crockpot last night to bring to my office's ""Hurricane Party" (Isabel!!) today.  I did use the full amount of tomato juice, but added a can of tommato paste as one reviewer suggested.  When I checked it this morning, it was thinner than I liked, so I added another can of tomato paste and another pound of browned ground beef.  Then I left it on low for about 3 hours.
Well, it was INHALED by my coworkers.  Many commented on the spices--not overly hot, but still nice.  One wanted it spicier--you can provide a bottle of tabasco on the side for those die-hards!

I thought this was great. I added more hot pepper to it to spice it up though. I also used chili beans instead of the pinto beans. This was so easy to make.

Once you've tried It's Chili by George, you'll never need another chili recipe.  My family asks for this one again and again.  I haven't had the need to make many changes.  I use 90%/10% ground beef, and I drain the fat from the pan after browning it.  I use red bell pepper instead of green.  For the combined total of 30 ounces of beans, I typically use what I have on hand, which is either all kidney beans or a mixture of kidney beans and black beans.  For the 75 ounces combined of tomato sauce and tomato juice, I use a variety of combinations of what I have on hand, such as canned tomato sauce, canned crushed tomato, canned pureed tomato, canned diced tomato with green chilies including the juice in the can,  canned plain diced tomato with the juice, and leftover jarred pasta sauce.  I have made this recipe in the slow cooker and on the stove top, and I think it comes out better on the stove top.  Made with the 90%/10% ground beef, this is a very healthy and filling meal.  This pairs well with the recipe for "sour cream cornbread" by Emily Hughes on the Allrecipes website.  Thank you, George Couch, for such a fantastic chili recipe!

First time making chilli and will be my go to recipe. I used a bunch of people's recommendations including a can of plumb tomatoes and a can of chilli flavoured diced tomatoes I had on hand instead of tomatoe juice. I subbed black beans for pinto beans and threw in a bottle of mild salsa I had going to waste. I also added a couple cups of frozen corn to great effect. It added nice colour and a little pop of sweetness in the spicy.

I'm from NM, so I tailored recipe to our local taste: added garlic; 4oz chopped jar/canned green chili, used small diced pork pieces instead of ground beef [browned/drained], & coarsely chopped celery. Omitted the tomato juice, but added ~24oz of can chopped tomatoes in green chilies w it's juices; 1/2 small can of tomato PASTE. Added only half the amount of tomato sauce in the recipe. Also added 1 can of BLACK beans [rinsed/drained]. 1hr before serving I added 4oz can sweet corn and 1/2c diced zucchini w/skins on. To serve, I topped with chopped fresh cilantro, diced fresh avocado and a dollop of sour cream. Served w JIFFY corn bread made with added green chili & sour cream to the recipe.

instead of tomato juice and tomato sauce, I used salsa right out of the jar, and you can use mild or hot or whatever heat you like.

A delicious recipe with a bit of a kick! My substitutions included a smidgen extra cayenne pepper. a can of black beans instead of the pinto beans, and instead of the tomato sauce I used a can of the stewed tomatoes with green chilies. I brought it to share with friends and it was loved by all.

I tend to take recipes and make them my own so that being said the only thing I changed about this one was substituting red pepper for the green and adding a few dashes of Frank's red hot for extra heat, I would have preferred the chili to be a little thicker so next time i make this i will try two cans of tomato sauce instead of one tomato sauce, one tomato juice. My family likes to put a corn bread muffin at the bottom of the bowl before scooping in chili and this recipe was great for that!

Love It! This recipe is awesome. So many things can be done different for personal preference. I cannot have peppers so I omit those and instead of pinto beans I use light red kidney. I add a large can of diced tomatoes in their juice and still use a small can of tomato sauce. I also use a full amount of tomato juice as we like the extra juice and as you eat it you can add more beans to make it last longer. All the spices are perfect however since we use more liquid I do use 1/4 cayenne pepper and up the chili powder a bit. Always turns out awesome and no mater what it ALL GETS ATE! Love this recipe and will continue to use it for many years to come! For those of you concerned about using cayenne pepper don't be. If you follow the recipe it does keep it very mild and not at all overpowering. You won't regret it! :)

I made this for lunch at my husband's office, and it was a hit! I had been nervous about making anything for the folks up there, but I need not have worried: one person had 3 helpings! I did follow other reviewers' suggestions about replacing the tomato juice with canned tomatoes (I had diced in the pantry), but I followed the rest of the instructions exactly. Super-easy, foolproof recipe...awesome!

Thanks George! I made this and my brother said it was the best chili he has ever had. My mom said she enjoyed every bite. I can't stress enough how EASY this recipe was. Quickest dinner. I made a few tweaks to fit my personal taste: replaced the tomato sauce AND juice with a large can of crushed tomato, used two cans of kidney beans and a can of chili beans (red beans with seasoning) instead of pinto beans, added a can of corn for color, and switched onions for onion powder (to please the onion haters in my family). It still stayed pretty true to the original recipe. This chili pleased everyone on football Sunday.  Americans are passionate about chili and there are a million ways to make it; this recipe is delicious as is or could serve as a perfect base for whatever someone wants to add/change.

This was good! I followed the recipe with the exception of not having tomato sauce. So, I used a can of diced tomatoes and some tomato paste. It came out perfect! Next time I will use vegetable juice instead of tomato juice just to add more veggies!

Best chili we've ever had!  I usually cook it in the crockpot.  Just throw in all ingredients and 8 hours later it's finished.  Making it for chili nachos tonight! Yum!

Very good chili - this has replaced my go to recipe clone of Wendy's. But definitely replace the tomato juice with equal parts diced tomatoes. Otherwise it is quite tasty.

That was pretty fine, I used several sweet peppers vs the green peppers. I also had Padilla negro chili and it gave it a nice smokiness. 
I used 1/2 ground and 1/2 stew meat, the stew meat I brown after rolling in a small amount of chilli powder. 

Also I add Chili powder  to the meat when I cooked it, it was a Nego Chili powder that gave it a fine smokey flavor.

I also ignored the sugar and the cayenne  pepper as two Padilla peppers roasted and sweated did the job.
oh and some Garlic not much like 3 cloves.

Oh just looked at what I said. 
Maybe that is why I don't find it bland.

This was a nice simple recipe. I think it is a good base chili recipe that you can add/change a couple things to for your preference. I added two cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. I also switched an anaheim pepper instead of the green pepper, and added a jalapeño for a little spice. This chili was so yummy!

Great basic recipe! I followed it pretty closely,however, more beans and smoked sausage - because that's how my gang likes their chili.

This recipe has been around for a while and I've been using it all that time.   It's never been bland for me because I simply alter quantities or add something new.  My sons love it and that's my seal of approval!  I've tried others but this one is easy to make, is tasty and there is always enough to get another meal or two out of it.

My relative made it and it was so good. I am not a big chili fan, however I plan to make a pot myself! She used diced tomatoes and brown sugar as well. I think this will be a recipe I will use many times this winter.

Yummo! Awesome! The only thing I added was a large can of chopped tomatoes and half a yellow onion, three small jalapenos seeded. The rest was exact! My only go-to from now on...even my husband loved it stating "I didn't think I liked chili..I could eat this allday long!

Loved the recipe. The tomato juice definitely gave it a distinct flavor.  i did add a lot more chili powder and cayenne to give it more flavor.  Also I used less tomato juice then suggest so it wouldn't come out so watery.  I will probably use less juice next time.

This was a great recipe. I used ground turkey and added honey to the meat while it was cooking to give it a hint of the sweet without using sugar. I also added habenaro peppers and a red pepper as well. I also added a bit of cumin, basil and onion powder. Oh and I used V8 for the tomato juice; threw is some stewed tomatoes, and bam!... and it was very yummy!

I found this recipe years ago. I've been using it ever since. I use 1 lb lean beef and 1 lb ground turkey. Everyone loves it. No one even knows it has ground turkey in it. It lightens it up and gives it that something special. It try to vary it sometimes. Even though it really doesn't need it. Tonight I put in canned chopped jalapeños instead of green peppers. Left out the cayenne pepper also. I am very happy I found this recipe! Love love love it! This is a photo of it while it was 30 mins into simmering.

I rarely eat chili and never make it (my husband is the chili maker in the house).  When I saw this recipe, I decided that it looked farely simple and decided to give it a try.  I was surprised at how easy it was to make and thought it was delicious, my husband gave it a "good" rating.  I will definitely make this again!

Unfortunately I only have extra-super-mega-spicy chilli powder so I tried leaving it out of the recipe and using 1/4 cup of cayenne pepper powder instead. Now I have an almost inedibly-spicy bland 8 litres of food. Not the recipe's fault but be careful when improvising. I have ruined countless batches of chilli by deviating from the recipe even in the slightest. I can't believe how sensitive chilli can be to exact amount of spice.

My girlfriend says: "This is the best chili I've ever had!" Just spicy enough, not too much. Awesome and easy. I added extra onion.

This was really very good, and as written, something you could serve anyone - child or adult. We prefer a little more spice and flavor, and so I kicked up the cayenne, cumin and chili (etc) seasonings by half. I also added a small seeded, diced jalapeno and about a half teaspoon of chipotle poweder. I used dried beans I'd done a quick-soak method on, so that could be why the chili wasn't as flavorful as we personally prefer. AGAIN, though, as written it is a GOOD chili recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and cooked it in the crockpot. That's what I'm giving 4 stars to. I've also altered it: no meat or bell pepper, lots of different beans (garbanzo, pinto, black, navy, etc.). And for more heat, I use Spicy V8 rather than plain tomato juice.

This turned out really tasty and it was really easy. It did need more beans and spice but its a great chili to make and fix it to the way you prefer.

Great, EASY recipe! I omitted green peppers and used 2 cans diced tomatoes for the other tomato products (1/2 recipe). Tastes great and my "chili expert" of a husband loves it!

We used to use McCormick's seasoning packet and I stopped because I didn't like all the preservatives and who knows what else is in there. This is a perfect substitute and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Hubs requested chili recently and rather than use my regular recipe, I decided to try this one.  I made half the recipe and did make some changes as some other reviewers suggested.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, one can of kidney beans, and no pinto beans.  I did thin it just a bit with a couple of splashes of V-8 juice.  I also used 1 T. brown sugar and no white sugar.  I would definitely make this again, but I think I’d omit the cumin just as a personal preference.

AMAZING!! I made it on the stove top and it came out perfect. About 2 hours of cook time and I left the cover off for the last 30 min of cook time to thicken it up. My modifications were:
-substituted tomato juice for diced tomatoes
-cooked the onions in with ground beef 
-added 2 tblsp of brown sugar (instead if white sugar)
-tripled all seasoning EXCEPT chili powder & Cayenne pepper 
-added some raw mushrooms 

Came out the perfect spiciness. My almost max level and my hubby's mild level. Lots of flavor and is a nice hearty stew. Next time ill add some more green pepper and that's about it. Excellent recipe. Love love love it. Thanks so much!

I never made this dish before and it made me look like a pro (HUGE HIT). I did have some changes to suit my taste. I substituted the 2 lbs of beef for 1.5 lb of ground turkey and 1 lb of Italian sausage hot/sweet pack(casing removed). I also cooked 2 cups of green peppers and onions with the meat before adding the sauce. Putting 24 ounces of tomato sauce and 8 ounces of diced tomatoes. Added 3 cans of kidney beans (no pinto because I could not find them), extra oregano and sugar. Everything else remained the same. Love this recipe and will be using this in the future. Hubby went back for thirds and my mother called to tell me she had two bowls. :)

I made this for a chili cook-off we had at our church today and I won 1st place.  The comment I heard most oten is "it has just the right amount of heat".  I made the recipe exactly as posted except I omitted the tomato juice and substituted that with  2 cans of petite diced tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, George!

Made this recipe for the first time last night in a crockpot. Liked it a lot. However I did make a couple of changes. I omitted the tomato juice, and instead used one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, I've also increased the sugar to 1 tbsp, omitted the oregano (because I didn't have any) and added a tad more onion. Everyone loved it, and people said it was the best chili they've had. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was good. :)

This is a good starter recipe. Like many others I tweaked to my preference.  I increased the meat and used 2 lbs beef and 1 lb sweet italian sausage, 1 15 oz can baked beans, 1 lg can diced tomatoes, 1 jar home canned tomatoes w/juice, inreased the amount of cummin and oregano, added cilantro, 3 cloves of garlic & 4 beef boullion cubes & worcestershire sauce. Absolutely delicious...My chili was absolutely fabulous!

OMG!!! This has got to be the best chili I have ever had and the first I have made.

I did make some modifications that werked for me.  First I added aboot 3 1/4 pounds of ground beef and 1 pound of ground hot sausage (no casing).  I added seasoning to taste while cooking the meat; cayenne, black and red pepper, natures seasoning, Italian blend, onion powder, garlic powder, salt.  Following a recommendation from another rater, I switched the tomato juice for canned diced toms in juice, to keep close to the 46 oz tomato juice, I added a 28 oz can of diced and 16 oz canned of toms and greed chilies.  Cooked it in the slow cooker for aboot 10-12 hours.  We had 7 for dinner and there was NOTHING left.  Add some cheddar and fritos for a filling meal.  Will definetly be making this again and again and again!

After making yet another pot of this delicious recipe tonight,  I knew I needed to post.  I searched for years for a good, solid recipe that appealed to my entire family (kids, husband and grandparents). This is a clear favorite by all. I make mine in the crock pot and let it simmer for 6+ hours.  It's a favorite.  Thanks George!!!

This was just alright, but not great.  It needed more salt, herbs, and tomato flavor so I fixed it up a bit.  I added garlic powder, Italian seasoning, tomato paste, and -since I had some to use up- black beans instead of pinto.  After the adjustments, this was quite tasty.

Good hearty chili.  I've made this a few times now- First time when I followed the recipe, it was kind of bland. Its got the thickness & consistency, but it definitely needed an extra kick. It's 'taste as you go' with the spices, so I ended up increasing the cumin, chili powder, etc until it reached the taste (and heat) I was looking for. I also decreased the beans by a can (personal preference) as I thought two cans was too much. Great recipe, nonetheless.

Delicious!  We omitted the tomato juice which was a good idea.  We also added corn.  We did a half recipe which was plenty for us and it only had to cook for an hour.

Enjoyed this chili very much. It was simple to make with very few dishes :) I added one can of drained diced tomatoes to this recipe but made no other changes. As written this chili is mild but has nice flavor. A good warm comfort food. Served with shredded Monterey Jack on top.

I agree with the other users who say that this is a good base but it is bland on its own. I threw in some jalapenos because I felt it wasn't spicy enough. I also added a red bell pepper and a can of corn for sweetness. In addition to the chicken stock, I added one bottle of dark beer which definitely adds flavor. Basil and fennel are a few more things I threw in there. And recently, I forgot the pinto beans but my SO commented that the chilli tasted better than before, I agreed. This is now my regular chilli recipe.

A great recipe overall. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly and felt it was too watery. This time I omitted the tomato sauce and added chopped fresh tomatoes (about two cups) and their juices and it is much thicker and heartier.
I also think the 10 minute prep time is kind of a joke. It takes me 10 minutes just to pull all of the ingredients and kitchen tools out, hah. Maybe I am just a slow cook? From start to finish prep time is more like 40 for me.

I have been looking for the perfect chili recipe and this is it. The consistency is thich and hearty. Definately a keeper. This will be the only chili recipe I use from here on out. I only used one can of beans and it was still thick and hearty.

Thank you George. Love this recipe and I have made it twice and will make it again and again. I generally use whatever canned beans available in my pantry. I also add on more spicy and chillies to give it a kick. My boys love this chilli! I served it with French Baguette but my husband thinks it would also go very well over rice.

This is a great recipe! I made a few changes to it being that I wanted it a bit thicker and I had a smaller crockpot! I added 1 stalk of celery, I only used about 5 oz of tomato juice, in addition to the 29 oz of tomato sauce I added another 8 oz can of Mexican style tomato sauce, and I also added 1 can of Rotel! Delicious! I will definantly be making this again! And it makes enough that my boyfriend and I will have food for a few days!

First time making chili and this recipe is delicious!  I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice like others suggested.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make this again!

Love it! It is not done yet, but I have been sampling. Reminds me of my Dad's recipe. I wish I would have paid more attention as a child. He was a great cook. My daughter may find it a bit too spicy, but she thinks toothpaste is spicy. This is a keeper. Thank you!

This is a good, standard kind of chili recipe.  We did add a clove of garlic and a little extra of the seasonings, plus a small hot pepper, also subbing black beans for pinto and honey for sugar.  Took the lid off for the last half hour of simmering and added about 2C frozen corn.  All in all, this chili is kind of bland, but still a good meal.

I made a few changes, less tomato juice, more sugar, 1 whole large bell pepper, half of a large yellow onion and just used 2 cans of pinto beans but this stuff is delicious! I will definitely be making it again! I already have friends waiting for bowls of my left overs.

The only thing we didn't add was the cayenne pepper, since we wanted our 4 year old to be able to eat it. Everything else was as the recipe called for, and it.was.amazing!! Best chili ever! My husband is HUGE into chili and is very picky about the taste and texture...this passed with flying colors AND 5 stars!!

This was a very easy and tasty chili.  Instead of using tomato juice and tomato sauce, I just used canned crushed tomatoes and threw in some leftover salsa.  I also added more bell pepper, garlic, and a more heat (more black pepper, more cayenne pepper, a dash of ground ghost chili, and a few drops of ghost chili sauce).  The result was a very flavorful chili of just the right consistency.

This was delish! we made it the crock pot, and I think through our own fault we used way too much tomato so it was very strong in that sense. But all in all it's very good and will be using less tomato products in it.

This chili was amazing! I used petite diced tomatoes instead of juice, and didnt have any oregano. I completely forgot to add the cumin, as I'm looking at the recipe right now! I cooked it in a crock pot for 8 hours. YUM! Next time I'll actually remember the cumin.

My husband has been asking me to make chili for a few months now. Every time we go out to eat, and he would order chili, he would remind me to make it to eat. This recipe was easy to follow and the taste was great. I did not have tomato juice so I used tomato paste dissolved in water. It tasted great!

This is one of the best chili recipes I have found.  It is delicious . The only change that I made was not putting in the cayenne pepper.  It has a bite to it without putting that in due to the chili pepper. Thank you George for sharing the recipe.

Very very good, however, I only used 1/2 can of tomato juice and added a cap of diced tomatoes that a squashed in my hand before cooking.  Will skip tomato juice next time.  Added garlic and onion powder.  Will definitely make it again :)  Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1.5 lbs lean ground beef and 1/2 pound ground pork sausage. Also used Lefty O'Doul's Bloody Mary mix (about 2 cups), diluted with 2 cups water, and a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes undrained in place of the tomato juice. It's not a runny as some reviewers mentioned as I cut down on the liquid with this substitution. This is amazing!

As others have mentioned, this is a great base for chili, but I altered somethings too. First of all, I left out the sugar all together. I also replaced half of the beef for venison. Lastly, I used two different types of tomato sauce. Half was Hunts plain tomato sauce and half was Hunts seasoned diced tomato sauce for chili. I let it simmer in the slow cooker for about 10 hours and topped it will a little cheese. I was very pleased. Will make again!

Very flexible recipe! I stuck to it as a foundation but tweaked based on what I had available (couple extra green peppers, extra pinto beans, extra onion, doubled cayenne pepper, added a can of chili beans from the cupboard, a little leftover chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, 4 or so cloves of garlice, and doubled most of the spices). Great!

Very good chili.  Love the name, since George submitted it.  It was quite thin/runny when I mixed the ingredients, but it thickened up nicely as it was on the stovetop all afternoon on med/low heat.  Served this with "Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rolls" from this site.  Delicious dinner on a chilly Sunday afternoon.

My first time making Chili and I really liked this recipe. I used garlic and tabasco sauce, would have added one more can of beans because it was a little liquidy but none the less yummy.

Great base chili (agree with other cooks) that lends itself to a few personalized add-ins.  I added brown sugar instead of white and added the cocoa as suggested by others.  My family really liked it!  It is a bit thinner than other recipes, but I added some more beans (variety) to thicken it up.  Very tasty!  Served on Baked potatoes or over elbow macaroni with toppings.  Will definitely make again.

This is a very good recipe! Just made a big pot of it and even the kids gobbled it down. I cooked the hamburger with the diced onion and green pepper. I also used chili beans and diced tomato in the can with basil and oregano seasoning(without draining) instead of tomato juice

I've been making this Chili for a while now - it's a great recipe !  I had tried making chili before and it always failed, but with this recipe it's always a success !  The only change I make is that I used either crushed or diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce ... Great recipe George !

I made chili for the first time today using this recipe and it turned out fantastic.  Had me going back for more.  I did not have any green peppers and put in celery instead.  Also subbed in tomato paste with 1 can of water instead of the tomato juice.  As recommended by George, I added some chocolate (60g semi sweet chocolate chips), and it added a delightful undertone to the chili.  I did not put in the cayenne pepper or chili powder because I have kids eating it.  I added a few splashes of Franks Red Hot Sauce before serving to adults.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Love it.

I love this chili recipe. My kids love it, having never really liked chili before. I use more beans - any kind I have in the pantry- red, navy, pinto etc. it all works. I also throw in what tomatoe stuff I have on hand. This is a great recipe for throwing everything in plus what you have on hand to make it your own chili. Thanks George

This was so good! My 6 y/o daughter even ate two bowls of it at one sitting. It wasn't too spicy for her at all and I was worried it might be. Made some cornbread to go with it. Delicious dinner!

Amazing!  I like to add an additional can of pinto beans.  Great for company... have lots of toppings to make things fun: Fritos, sour cream, green onions, olives, tomato, red pepper, and cheese!  Mmm!

Love, love, love this recipe. My husband, who is my greatest critic and cheer leader, loved this chili too.  I did add stewed tomates, simply b.c. we love tomatoes.  Turned out perfectly. I was concerned the 2 cans I added would make the chili too runny.  It didn't.  The low cooking for 1 1/2 hours took care of that.  Way to go George!

I would actually rate this recipe a 4.5 only because I revised it to fit my needs.  I replaced the tomato sauce for tomato puree for a lesser sodium content.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes and elimnated the pinto beans.  It turned out to be very delicious.  I'm sure the original would be just as delicious.

Even after cutting back a little on the tomato juice (about 8 ounces), this was way too watery. The flavor was good, but it was really thin. Maybe I will try it again, making more drastic changes like some of the other reviewers.

My first chili I ever made- for a chili contest.
I thought it was good, but I heard comments about it being too soupy/tomatoey. Nope I didn't win or came anywhere near it, but it was easy to make! I'd make it again if my family had liked it, but they weren't crazy for it :(

Delicious! Set and forget. Cooked on low for 11 hours in my slow cooker. I used two whole onions and an entire green bell pepper. For personal taste, I would probably add an extra can of beans next time. Flavor was great! Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't use all the Chili Powder this recipe called for as I didn't want a real spicey chili and it still tasted great.  I suggest making it a day or two ahead of serving as it tasted better the next day after the flavors had time to sink in.

Yes, this is it.  I have perfected many a chili recipe, but I still wondered.  Today, we were in the mood for chili and I searched for something new. This was a nice, rich, hearty but light recipe and proved to be a good base.  The tomatoe base's are nice (sauce and paste).  Only half the juice, and added a can of dice tomatoes with chili peppers, and chiptole or two.  Wow, very happy.  The taste was not extremely unique, but ecompased the great features of a basic+ chili recipe.  This is it for a "chili" recipe.

Made this exact recipe over the weekend for a party we had at our apartment. It made A LOT of chili! That was a good thing though because it was a big hit! I did as another commentor suggested and doubled the spices just to ensure that we would get that delicious "chili" flavor we all know and love. It worked. I also added a can of corn that we had in the pantry for added heartyness. Next time, I will probably get a can of stewed tomatoes and use that in place of half of the tomato juice. The chili was a bit soupy the first time around. After being frozen and reheated on the stove, however, it was not quite as soupy. Heats up great too. Will be making again very very soon.

This is awesome chili, either by itself, with hot tamales, with cheese, sour cream, and fritos. The grandchildren love to dip peanut butter sandwiches in it and the macho men add Texas Pete hot sauce to it.

I make a mean pot of chili myself.But I am always looking on recipe sites to see how others make theirs and what ingredients that they use.But in this recipe here,for the life of me,I can't understand putting sugar in chili.One of my brother in laws,is from Ohio and he said they put sugar in their chili up there.I'm a southern boy and we don't put sugar in ours down here.Also,it seems to me that with that much liquid added from the tomato juice and the tomato sauce,that this would be a very liquid-based chili.Does a lot of the liquid content reduce down as it cooks?I also don't see any diced tomatoes added from cans.I use every one of these ingredients in mine except for the tomato juice,tomato sauce,or the sugar.However,I will add the tomato sauce to mine;I like that idea.An extra added flavor.This sounds like a good recipe to me except for the sugar.

This is a great base recipe but I did tweak it a little. I didn't use the tomato juice but used Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic and Oregano instead.

My husband and I really thought this chili flavor was spot on.  I followed the spice part exactly.  I added an extra can of kidney beans and like some other people said I added two cans of diced tomatoes (rotel actually) and two small cans of v8.  All I had was pasta sauce and I was nervous about it so I only added like a cup instead of a whole jar.  I really think you can tinker with the tomato/juice element but the spice part of this is exaclty how I think chili should taste.  I browned beef and then did crock pot on high for four hours.  Worked great.

I wanted to make a simple chili and this one is very good! - I didn't have pinto beans, sugar or tomato juice.   I added a can off crushed tomatoes,  and added 1/2 cup of water. Our family likes it more on the spicier side - so we added extra cayenne peppers. Makes a great chili!

After reading the previous reviews I did a little adjusting myself. We are fans of spice but not fans of chunks bell pepper or onions so I chose to use a can of tomatoes with onion and garlic then tripled all the spices and added some crushed red pepper for good measure. All in all it was a great base recipe and something that we will definitely use again!!

First try at chili and it came out perfect. I did the standard size can of stewed tomatoes and 1 1/2 cans of sauce, suggested by other  reviewers. Microwaved great the next day too. Update 12-27-12.. On my 5th batch. sitting at a can of sauce, a can of stewed, and a decent squeeze of ketchup.

Omg!!! Thank you! I have been trying to find a great chili recipe forever. The search is over. I halved this recipe , only kept the green pepper the same. I always disliked soupy chili, so A BIG thanks to all those who suggested adding tomato paste, the texture,taste and appearance of this chili is just perfection.

My family and I absolutely loved this chili.  I did not have fresh onion or bell peppers so I used dehydrated minced onion, and a jar of roasted red peppers.  It was so good that I do it every time now.

I don't typically leave reviews - but I had to for this. While I was cooking my boyfriend insisted that I didn't know what I was doing and that he liked how his mom's looked better than mine. Well. . . .after inhaling one bowl he went back for seconds -- and even said he likes it better than his mom's! (NEVER happens)  Adaptations I made: Sauteed (half) the peppers, onions, 2 garlic cloves, 1 stalk celery in butter - then browned the meet in same skillet.   Like everyone else I changed the tomato juice to diced tomato's as well.   Definitely recommend this one!

What a great base!! I use this all the time, but instead of a can of tomato sauce I use one 15oz can of stewed tomatoes and one 15oz can of diced tomatoes. I also throw in three or four diced carrots (whatever is in the house) and three or four stalks of celery. I put it in my slow cooker on high for 30mins and med-low for two hours. I serve over shells with sour cream, diced green onions and shredded taco cheese.

My chili hunt continues...Don't get me wrong, it's a good recipe but it is a gut bomb.  It's a very heavy chili and I'm looking for something that isn't murder to the digestive system :)  Taste is outstanding but much too heavy.

I followed this recipe almost to a T, but I did subsitute the pinto and kidney beans for chili beans. I added stewed tomatoes, because it was a little too "soupy" at first. Followed others advice and added garlic. It was delicious, I would highly recommend!

This chili was EASY and VERY good! I didn't have to continually add spices because it was already just right! I cooked it in the crockpot and instead of tomato sauce, I just used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes. Great recipe!

I made this chili today and it's excellent! However; I did make a few changes per other reviewer suggestions.  Here's what I did:  Omitted the tomato juice and cayenne pepper. - added 30 oz. of crushed tomatoes and some garlic salt...and I used 1 whole onion and green pepper.  I browned the beef with the onion and seasoned it with garlic salt, salt and pepper...then I threw everything in the slow cooker and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  The consistency is on the thick side, which is how we like it. Very easy and very tasty.

As others have said - it's a good base to start your chili with.  Threw in some canned tomatoes, an extra can of beans, and only about half the can of tomato juice.  Hubby loved it.

Yum.  It wasn't spicy enough for the BF, but that could have easily been fixed.  Otherwise my whole family love it.  Only thing I might change next time is to half the Tomato Juice and add Stewed Tomatoes.  Some chunks of Tomato would have made this all the better, imo.

This is the best chili out there.  The only thing I changed is instead of a can of tomatoe juice, I used a can of crushed tomatoes.  I like having some tomatoe chunks in my chili personally.  Other than that, I would not change a thing.  It has just the right amount of spice as well...not too over powering that it takes awy from the flavor.  Wonderful recipe thank you!

This is my favourite chili recipe ever.  Instead of tomato juice, I substitute a 28oz can of tomatoes as many reviewers suggested.  We make this in big batches in our slow-cooker and freeze for easy reheats on busy nights.

The best chili I've ever had- we are totally addicted! The only thing that I do differently is add a few cloves of pressed garlic. If it's a little more watery than I'd like, I just cook it down with the lid off for a little while until it's the consistency I want.

Update: You can easily stretch the recipe a little more with an extra can of beans, and I like to add some extra green pepper. Toss some grated cheddar cheese on top and serve with homemade corn bread

OK......I loved it, my wife loved it, my kids loved it, my friends loved it, my co-workers loved it, my BOSS loved it, thanks for the promotion George. The only thing I added was 1/4 cup of fresh parsley and 1TBSP of crushed chili peppers.

Great recipe! I used only half of the beef and it still came out very flavorful (thanks to all the spices!) And don't be shy on the cumin, it is the essence of this recipe!  To deepen the flavor even more, I also added two tablets of unsweetened tsokolate (Filipino cocoa tablet -  or use two sqaures of unsweetened/bitter chocolate). Oh, and I served it with cheddar corn biscuits, great match!

Outstanding! I used one 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes, one 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic, and one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of the tomato juice. The jalapenos kicked up the spice nicely and the fire roasted tomatoes gave it a smoky flavor that made it taste like I had simmered it for longer than an hour and a half. A great recipe to work from and just enough room to personalize for one's specific tastes. Well done George!

Very good chili.  I also substituted the tomato juice with diced tomatoes. Next time, I would also add a can of tomatoe paste to thicken it up.  I also added a splash or two of red wine-yum!

Great job George.  Two thumbs up. I followed recipe as stated and it turned out great. I'm having a Super Bowl party and that is going to be my contribution [along with the beer].

I used this as a general recipe. I made a lot of adjustments in quantities, but the combination of the spices was great. I did it in the crock pot for 10 hours, and it was absolutely fabulous.

I followed this recipe perfectly, used my crockpot and the chili turned out like a soup, way too much liquid.  If your going to try this recipe I suggest you only add about 1/2 the tomato juice, see how it looks and if you need to add more.

I used V8 Spicy Hot Tomato Juice in this recipe and added 2 TBS brown sugar and 1 TBS cocoa.  I like to let my chili simmer for a while, and this was on the stove for five hours.  About the time I put Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread (on this site, and it was delish) in the oven, I checked on the chili and saw that it was VERY dehydrated.  I gave it a stir and found that the bottom 1/4" was burnt.  This was on the lowest setting on my stove, so it is a mystery to me.  This never happened with any of my other chili recipes.  I tasted it and it was garbage.  I took it off the stove, scooped it into the crock pot, added 1 c. water, 1/4 c. Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp fresh ground pepper, 2 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp chili powder and turned the crock pot on high for 1/2 hour, then down to low until my husband came home (another 1/2 hour or so).  By that point, it tasted pretty good.  Still, it was not spicy enough for either of us and was overall pretty bland considering how much spice was in it.  We both thought it needed more beans, too (it was lacking in texture).  I think I'll stick to Boilermaker Chili (on this site).  I just wanted to let everyone know that with this recipe, for whatever reason, you really need to keep an eye on it if you intend to simmer it for longer than two hours.  This recipe isn't very good for chili, but my husband thinks it's kick-butt awesome on hot dogs, and I have to agree with that.

This was a wonderful basic chili recipe but I did make several changes. I used 1 1/2lbs lean ground beef and 1/2 lb italian sausage. I then added four cloves of garlic, almost doubled the chili powder, added another teaspoon of cumin, only used half of tomato juice as everyone else suggested, and added one can drained chopped tomatoes. It could not have turned out better! Thank you George and reviewers, it's recipes like this that keep me coming back to this website more than any other.

Very tasty chili.  I thought the 1/4 cup of chili powder seemed excessive so I added 2 TBS instead which is about 1/2 of what is called for.  For me it was plenty spicy.  I also thought it was a bit watery but the favor was very good.  This was my first attempt at making chili and I will make it again.

I halved this recipe and actually made it VEGAN! I substituted 1 package of Yves Original Veggie Ground Round for the lb of beef, and left everything else the same, except for doubling the onions. It came out just right. Even though I halved the recipe, I seem to have come out with about 8 servings.  This is really a big recipe.

This is an excellent base recipe for chili!  It's very flavorful and hearty!  Like others I made changes to suit our tastes.  I used a couple jalapenos (no seeds) instead of green peppers, used only one small can of V-8 juice, and used beef broth to thin it out as it cooked.  I used 3 cans of pinto beans and no kidney beans.  I doubled the oregano and black pepper.  I used two kinds of chili powder (New Mexico & California) and added about 1 tsp. of garlic powder, and about 1 tsp onion powder.  Play with this recipe and have fun with it!  You can't go wrong!

GREAT recipe, great flavor ... I'd add more beans next time to make it even healthier ... I used a regular size can .. this was my favorite thing to make so far! Maybe next time I'll eat it w/ french fries or nachos! mmmm :)

7/25/12 Edit:
It's been awhile since I made this. After reading over one of the reviews, I doubled all the spices (including the chili powder), and the result was a weird, bitter aftertaste that I had to try to fix by adding salt and extra sugar. Note to self: next time, double all the ingredients EXCEPT the chili powder and cayenne pepper!

For two people, the servings for 5 was plenty, with enough leftovers for a couple days. The hubby loved it :)

This recipe is awesome. It makes a huge pot and my family of three had it all eaten within the week. The only change I made was I didn't have tomato juice so I used an extra can of tomato sauce and a can of water. Also if you like spice, kick up the cayenne. So yummy! Thank you!

Love this one.  I omit the sauce ,juice and peppers. I use 2 cans of Rotel and 1 can diced tomato.  I also only use black beans because we love them.  I leave the spices the same.  I add water and beef base to make it a bit soup-ier since I omitted the sauce.  I simmer till we can't take it anymore and we dig in.  Delish!

I have tried many different chili recipes in search for the perfect one to have as "my" chili recipe. And, I have finally found it! I made this last night for a few friends for Halloween. The only thing I changed was to use a bottle of V8, at another's, suggestiong. I also simmered it about two hours longer which helped thicken it up a bit. Either way, it still would have been awesome. But circumstances allowed for the extra simmer time. I might add a bit of minced garlic next time as a personal prefrence, not because it is missing anything. There is only two of us in the house so I might make less next time because it sure makes a lot, but I am so happy to have leftovers today. I think today, I might cook up some chili dogs! Thanks, George for finally allowing me to find a chili recipe that is a total keeper!!!!!

I've been using George's chili recipe for more than 2 years now. (Thanks, George-It's because of you, that "NO ONE makes a better chili" than me!) I started out making it just like the recipe is written and it's absolutely fabulous that way. Then one day, we wanted chili and I didn't have the tomato juice on hand...I replaced it with a can of Rotel's "Chili Fixin's" tomatoes and a large can of Old El Paso Enchilada sauce. It didn't make it better, just more suited to my family's taste. The only other thing is I used Chili Beans for the Pintos. Go no further. Look no where else! This is your new chili recipe. Promise!

Wonderful recipe.  The only changes made were replaced the tomato juice with diced tomatos and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar.  Cooked the beef and onions and threw everything else in the slow cooker. Served with cheddar cheese and corn muffins Delicious!!!

This was too much tomato taste.  I added Paprika and much more cumin and it still didn't taste like the chili I was brought up on.  It was more like chili con carne my New Jersey friend makes.  I will not make again.

This is by far the beat chili I have ever made.  Following some of the other comments, I substituted the tomato juice with a 29oz can of crushed tomatoes and 15oz can of tomatoe sauce.  I did up the chili powder to 1/3 cup as well. This is a great, and easy, meal to cook in the slow cooker (which I did). Awesome Chili!

We like our chili a little hotter so I used a can of green chilis instead of the bell peppers, added extra cayanne and black pepper.  It was really good.

I made this one month when I was messing around with Once A Month cooking.  We freezed two large ziploc bags worth and thawed/reheated when it was time to have it.  Even not eating it fresh, my husband said it was the best chili he'd ever had and couldn't believe I made it all by myself! (Oh he of little faith!)  He's asked several times since we ran out for me to make it again and since our grocery store has hamburger meat on sale this week, I bought extra to make a big batch! (I left out the cayenne pepper because I don't like spicy stuff and it was still awesome and flavorful!)

This Chili was really good, and very easy to make. Since this is the first time I've used this recipe I followed it to the T. I think that next time I make it I'll reduce the tomato juice just a bit because it was a tad on the runny side, but we enjoyed it nonetheless!

Tasty! Makes a lot, but leftover chili is no hardship. I added a 1/2 cut up block of velveeta to 2 cups-ish of this chili, got raves on my chili cheese dip. I made a few changes, most notably, I subbed part of tomato sauce with can of Rotel, subbed one pound of beef with ground turkey and added more cumin.  It cooked in the crockpot all day on low; great smell to come home to!

Fabulous!  This is now the only chili recipe I will use.  Just pulled some from the freezer the other night at my family's request, and it tasted just as good as if I had just made it.

Like several people suggested, I used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and it came out great!  I think I have found a new favorite chili recipe!

I decided to try this as a change from my regular chili becvause it was a little easier to make and used less ingredients.  It was bland but at the same time, too salty.  I will stick with my Washabineros Chili from this site.  It is the very best!

Yummy!!! The only thing I didn't add was the tomato juice and used a can of stewed tomatoes.  Fantastic enough that my 3 year old loved it!

VERY GOOD flavor. Easy to make as well. I like to let mine simmer for 2 - 4 hours and it's even better! Soo good on a chilly, rainy day!

After reading several reviews (and sorting through the pantry), I made this chili with a few modifications: Instead of the beans used in this recipe (the kidney beans and the pinto beans), I used one 15 oz. can of Joan of Arc Spicy Chili Beans (undrained). Instead of the tomato juice, I used one 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes (undrained), and one 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes (undrained).  Instead of the 28 oz. can of tomato sauce, I used two 15 oz. cans of tomato sauce. I didn't have a green pepper, so I used one 4 oz. can of La Preferida mild green chiles.  I put all of this in a 5 quart slow cooker. It has been cooking on high for 2 hours.  I just sampled the chili and it is out of this world!  I just love the tang that this chili has, without being overwhelming. Thanks for the recipe and to all reviewers for so many great ideas!

This is a great chili recipe. I did make a few changes. Instead of tomato juice, I used two cans of diced tomotoes with celery, onion, and peppers, this allowed me to substitute the pepper with diced green chiles. I also only used a 15oz. can of tomato sauce. Turned out thick and delicious!!!

Great chili overall.  Doubled all spices except chili and cayenne.  Doubled pinto beans and added a can of black, as there weren't enough beans in the chili for us.  Added two tbsp. of brown sugar also and a few drops of hot sauce.  Husband and kids really liked it well, just asked me to reduce the "tomatoey" taste a bit next time.  Perfect base to use and build on for your family's tastes.

I tried this chili two ways.  The first time I followed it to a T and the second time I swapped crushed tomatoes for the tomato juice.  I preferred it much more with crushed tomatoes, but I still couldn't get excited about this recipe.  It was just "ok"....not going to win any awards with this one.

Excellent recipe as written and very easy to make.  I use the slow cooker and usually assemble it the night before and refrigerate to give the flavors more time to blend and save time in the morning.  Sometimes I leave out the cayenne pepper since my family is a bunch of spice wimps.  I've made this 5 times and each received rave reviews.  Give it a try.  Thanks George!

This is really good basic chili!  I didn't have tomato juice, so I substituted 32oz tomato sauce and 6oz tomato paste.  I have little ones, so omitted the cayenne and monkeyed with the rest of the seasonings to taste, including using brown sugar instead of white.  Will definitely make again with who knows what modifications!  Thanks, George!

Delicious and easy!  Will definitely make again!  I didn't have tomato juice though so I substituted with condensed tomato soup (1 can soup & 1 can water).  It still worked nicely.

Wow!!  This chili is outstanding, and I look forward to making it again and again!!  I only made a couple very minor changes.  Instead of the half teaspoon of white sugar, I used about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar (I like my chili a little sweeter), and instead of the large 46 ounce can of tomato juice I used 3 smaller cans (to equal about the same number of ounces) of diced tomatoes (the kind with basil, oregano, and garlic) in juice (I enjoy a little thicker chili with chunks of tomatoes).  Since the diced tomatoes already had oregano in them, I omitted the oregano from my batch.  It was so delicious, my husband and I each ate two large bowls of this chili.  We are both looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  My search for a great chili recipe is over!  Thank you George!!!!!

This recipe is a GREAT starting point for amazing chili. Of course like everyone else, I made a few changes. I carmalized the onions (rough chop for more texture) and added about 2 tbsp. of minced garlic to the my dutch oven pan before browning the beef. It should go unsaid that you MUST drain the meat after its finished browning. I added 2 cans of diced tomatos (I didn't have any sauce, ALWAYS IMPROVISE!!!) and mashed another can of tomatoes through a sive to add more juice to the chili. I added only one can of light kidney beans, liquid and all. I did double alot of the seasonings and added some of my own. I used about 1/3 a cup chili poweder, 1 tbsp of cayenne, plenty of oregeno and cumin, I also added paprika, salt, plenty of black pepper, garlic powder, Adobo seasoning and onion powder. I brought it to a boil and then turned down to simmer and let it cook for about 6 hours. This was the first time I had ever made chili... I never had a recipe!!! It easily could of only cooked for an hour and still been wonderful. And my husband who protested me putting the beans in the chili said he absolutly loved the beans in there and would deffinatly eat it again! It was so good that I only have one small bowl left and we only had 4 people eating dinner that night. Absolutly great recipe that you must try, but feel free to add your own spin!

Delicious!  I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice because my store was out.  Also, I used black beans instead of the other kinds and added some fresh cilantro.  This would also be good with a chuck roast cut into small cubes instead of the ground beef.  The spice was perfect.

I came on this site to look for the perfect chili and I FOUND It. Thank you !!! The only thing that I would change is the amount of Tomato juice... It came out a little too watery but I made it in a slow cooker so maybe that was the reason why. Other than that, It was amazing.

This is a great recipe by itself.  I have made it exactly the way it is and I have made it with some changes that are great too.  I sometimes use ground venison which is terrific even if you dont care for venison, becuase it does not have any game taste to it, you just taste CHILI!  I cut out the tomato juice completely and just either use diced canned diced tomatoes or I chop my own, using the juices as well, and use a can of tomato sauce.  I use brown sugarf instead of white and I double the spices and I steam the meat beforehand then add to rest of ingredients. I use diffrent beans depending on what I have on hand at the time and I serve either with fritos, crackers or spaghetti noodles and have sides of shredded cheese, onions, and sour cream on the table so people can doctor it up just the way they like it.  great "base recipe", then just play around with it.  You really cant mess it up.  Thanks!

I substitute 2 lg cans of stewed tomatoes instead of juice for a thicker chunky chili. Fabulous- this is my stand-by recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

This was good but I can't say it differed much from buying the pre-made chili seasoning in the store.  You could do that and save yourself a lot of time.  Sorry, George but this just wasn't the knock your socks off chili I was looking for.

I realize I'm just piling on to one of the most reviewed recipes on this site, but I had to add my own thoughts.  This recipe is a great, versatile base that's easy to be creative with.  I usually like to use stewed tomatoes (instead of the tomato sauce) to create more body.  I also like a spicier chili, and add three diced jalapenos, along with two or three whole habanero peppers while simmering.  The habaneros have a great, warm flavor and give the chili a nice kick.  I would suggest toning down the amount of chili powder a bit (half of the suggest 1/4 cup), as as that amount can be overpowering.  Also, sometimes I add corn just to have something different, and give it a more southwestern feel.  

But the best part of chili is the actual experience of creating it, tasting and modifying as it simmers, and ultimately making it your own.  Enjoy!

I made this recipe like the original with the exception that I added additional cumin. This chili is very good, but I can't give it five stars. It is very strongly tomato flavored. For folks that appreciate that as the dominant flavoring in chili, then they should love this one. I on the other hand love chili based more on chili powder/cumin/onion flavor base with tomato playing a lesser role. If I make this one again, I will add some minced garlic. I will also add about 1/4 cup corn masa flour dissolved in a little cold water to thicken the chili, as this recipe was a little thinner that I favor too.

ABSOLUTELY amazing!  This was my first attempt at chili and I will be sticking with this recipe!  I used 3 cans diced tomatoes with one of them having jalepenos in them.  I used hot mexican chili powder, curry powder and ground chipole powder. I used tomato sauce but as it simmered it started thickening up so I added a bottle of V8 juice to it.  I simmered it on low for 3 hours and the house smelled nummy.  I cooked up a box of elbow macaroni and added it to it.  Served it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  My husband was sampling it while it cooked and then ate 3 bowls of it for supper!!!!

I gave this recipe a 5.. It was perfect. My husband and I loved it and my 1 year old son loved it too. I did exactly as the recipes but I added a can of diced tomatos. I really really love this recipe. I definitely will be making this again.

I will be making this again!!  I used half turkey/half beef, added garlic (of course) and used 1 tablespoon brown sugar instead of white. Very good.  Mine came out a little soupy, so next time i might try counting back on the juice. EDIT- instead of cutting back on juice I just add more beans. I've made this recipe many times and always get good reviews.

Simple, basic, easy, what chili should be. I added 2 cans of kidney beans, left out the pinto beans and added a can of black beans. Oh I also added a can of diced tomatoes.

Very good basic chili recipe, I followed it exactly as written as all first time attempts should be and in the future, I probably won't change a thing as we like our chili uncomplicated.

I love chili, have tried lots of recipes.  This one is really good.  Made some changes.  Like many others, I like my chili hearty and thick, so I substituted diced tomato cans, and fresh tomatoes for the tomato juice...it worked a trick.  I also fried up the onions in advance in a little olive oil, then added the meat, rather than just adding raw onions. Nice, easy, makes loads for a busy family...leftover for lunches, great served over basmati rice.

Very good.  I've made with less meat and more beans, and as written.  It's very mild, so I add more chili powder and tabasco...very flexible to changes.  Always a huge hit!

I rated this a 5 because I think the mixture of seasonings is great. I halved my recipe, and like many others, had to use a can of chili style stewed tomatoes and water. I used half a can of kidney beans and another half a can of pinto chili style beans. The seasoning mixture was perfect. I'm not rating the thickness as I didn't measure exactly for the water amount. But when I make chili by taste, I can never get the taste just right and this was the best I've ever made! It was slightly spicy (oh yeah, had to leave out the cayenne as I have 2 small children) but my girls still ate it. Way to go, George!!

This is a very basic very good chili.  I was skeptical at first that the only tomato stuff in it was juice or sauce, but I tried it once, following the recipe exactly and was very surprised at how good it was.  I loved how saucy it was.  However, I usually put some sort of canned diced tomatoes in.  Oh, and to make it a little healthier, only use one pound of ground beef but double (2 cans of each kind) the beans.  YUM!

I made 3 pots for 30 people last night with slight variations (one as written, one had no onions, another was spiced up a bit) and everyone chose from their preferences and raved about it.  Thank you George!

This chili is amazing!  I prefer a chunkier chili, so I substituted diced tomatoes with juice for the tomato juice.  I tasted it once it had simmered for a while, and I wanted more of that mexican flavor, so I added a couple of Tbsp. of taco seasoning!  Perfect!  Update:  made with ground turkey for a healthier chili and it's just as good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe! Made some changes, but nothing major. I only used 1 pound of ground beef, replaced the other pound with mushrooms and corn. I used one 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and about 15 oz of tomato juice so there wouldn't be too much liquid. I also only used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce. Omitted the onion and used a can of diced green chilis instead of bell pepper. Served topped with shredded cheese and I always eat my chili with sour cream, too. Very good, thank you!

This made a perfect pot of chili!  I have looked high and low for a good chili recipe.  

I didn't have tomato juice, so I used 2 15 oz. cans of blended, diced tomatoes and added a little water to thin it out and we used pinto beans instead of the kidneys (personal preference).  It was fantastic!

This is an excellent chili recipe that you can tweak to fit your own taste.  I cooked it on low in the crockpot for 7 hours, used three types of beans - pinto, kidney and black.  Instead of tomato juice I used one can of stewed tomatoes; one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.  I also added some minced garlic and Franks Red Hot Sauce to give it some bite.  My husband loved it and I think this is going to be my new chili recipe.  Thanks George!

I have my own chili recipe that my family loves, but every once I like to try different recipes to compare to my own.  I followed this recipe exacly as stated.  Believe me, I wanted to make a few additions but I didn't.  After cooking several hours in the crockpot I decided to taste it.  First of all, it was way to runny for me, I prefer a thicker, chunker chili.  Secondly, it was too spicy for my kids to eat (should have cut back on the chili powder and cayenne).  In order for my family to eat it,  I added 1/2 cup of smokey sweet BBQ sauce, a small amount of beer and a can of chunky tomatoes.  I also added 2 tbls. of masa mixed with 1/4 cup hot water and made into a paste and added to chili.  This did thicken it up.

I have been making this chili for the past two years (twice a year) for my  husbands work (75+ men).  They absolutely rave about this chili.  I do alter it some... I divide the total amount of meat to include steak, beef kielbasa and beef sausage (for differect textures).  I omit the tomato juice and substitute diced/whole tomatoes (variety).  While I cook the meat I season it with the chili powder and then sautee the onions and green pepper.  Then I add all the other ingredients to the meat mixture.  Usually the meat mixture and veggies blend together overnight and then I add the rest the next morning.  Everyone who has tasted my version begs for the recipe.

I made this yesterday in the slow cooker and followed recipe as written.  My husband LOVED this recipe for chili after several not as wonderful attempts on my part.  My kids and I don't even like chili and we thought it was pretty darn good.  I will be making this again!

Great chili! I followed other users suggestions and cut the tomato juice and used diced tomatos instead. Very hearty and delicious!

I made this recipe for a chili contest at work and won TOP PRIZE out of 15 other types of chili!!

(I did give you full credit George & All Recipes!)

Everyone loved the flavor, nothing too outrageous, just a good, basic taste. The only thing I did switch was to use a can of petite crushed tomatoes in place of one of the cans of tomato sauce.

Thanks again!!

This is a great base recipe.  I like a very hearty chili and from ready other reviews, the chili seemed to come out "soupy", so here is what I did: 

I added 4 cans of dark kidney beans (drained and un-rinsed)instead of just 1.

I substituted the 1 can of pinto beans for 6 cans of chili beans (3 hot, 3 mild) all drained but not rinsed.

I used half of the recommended chili powder since I used unrinsed chili beans.

I sprinkled in about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder for some added flavor.  

Also, if you like tomatoes, put in a couple cans of Fire-Roasted tomatoes with garlic.  You can find them with the rest of the can tomato products.

This is a great chili recipe. I've been looking for a good one...My wife has her mom's recipe that has always been the comparison, and I haven't been able to get her to like anything else - until this one.  It has a great overall flavor, without anything being too strong.  The thing I liked about it was that it was fairly easy to make too. I love cooking, but with something like chili, I don't want to go out and spend $60 in ingredients to make the stuff...but at the same time, some of the basic recipes don't have enough flavor.  I think that's why I settled on this one. It's the best of both worlds. Everyone loved it. My brother-in-law ate probably half of it.  I always make Mexican Cornbread whenever I make chili too. My wife can't go without it anymore.  Here's the recipe I use for that - http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Absolute-Mexican-Cornbread/Detail.aspx.  It's a great combo.

Hope this helps somebody trying to decide!  Side note - I made this recipe EXACTLY as-is.  No changes, substitutes, etc.

Awesome chili recipe, very popular among friends.  Changed it a little like everyone else...I added crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice and also almost a whole can of the small cans of tomato paste.  I like my chili thicker, not soupy.  This gave it the perfect consistency.  Also added a little more cumin and cayenne (to taste).  Also added coriander which is found in a lot of chili recipes, but not this one...gave it just a little more spice taste...perfect! :)

Great recipe!  Of course I changed a few things.  :o)

1. Added more cayenne pepper because I like it HOT!  Yum!
2. Instead of tomato juice, I added a can of diced tomatoes.
3. I add the peppers and beans at the end so they don't get all mushy!
4. I also added a few various diced hot peppers!

This chili is awesome!  I made it for some girlfriends on a chilly evening in Germany while our husbands were deployed and it did not disappoint.  The only things I changed was to substitute 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato juice and I added 2 cloves of garlic and 2 sliced jalapeños for some extra kick.

This was a great quick meal for my Hubby to take to work for his staff.  They have been working lots of hours and he wanted to do something nice for them.  They all loved it.  My hubby only got a small taste.  But said it was good.  I didn't use the tomato juice.  I used tomato sauce and diced tomatoes instead.  I kept everything the same.  It was a big hit, he came home with an empty crock pot.  Thanks, George for the recipe.

After serving this to a group of people I received several comments like "this is the best chili I have ever had!".  I replaced the tomato juice and sauce with a combination of canned crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes - otherwise I followed the recipe.  Great tip - try the "Fire Roasted" style of canned tomatoes (Muir Glen is the only brand I have ever seen)- the flavor rocks!

This was my favorite chilli recipe. My whole family loved it, and I had to make enough to feed 12. I've made this twice and each time the pot was empty the same day it was made. 

I did a substitution by taking out the can of tomato juice and adding a couple cans of diced tomatoes which made the chilli thicker and heartier, which my family loved. By far this is still the best tasting chilli I've eaten and made.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and delicious.  I do add 1 can of diced tomatoes and use 2 cans of kidney beans and 2 cans of chili beans.  I also add a habanero for more spice.  So good topped with sour cream and cheese.

Awesome!  This was great.  I used 4 cans of 8 oz. tomato sauce because I did not have a 29 oz. can.  Next time I would cut that down to 3.  I slow cooked it for several hours and uncovered it the last hour to help thicken it up.  Fantastic!

not so sold on this one. it was way too spicy. i guess it would be okay to have if you didn't have children or a sensitive stomach. i have a recipe much better than this one. i think i'll stick to the one i'm used to.

Excellent Chili. A few modifications- I didn't have tomato juuice so I added I small can of tomato paste and two cups of beef bullion.  The amount of seasoning was just right!  Served over tortilla chips with sour cream and grated cheese.  Thanks for a great chili receipe.

This was sooo good. It was the best chili I have ever made.  I will definitely be making it again. I like using my own seasonings instead of a spice packet.  I used ground turkey instead of ground meat and I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with chili peppers. I think next time I will use 1 more can of regular tomatoes and 1 more can of beans.

This was SUPER hot...not sure about the 1/4 cup chili powder, but it was too hot to eat, probably would be great with less chili powder.

My husband who is a chili-lover for years, as well as me, who doesn't like chili at all both loved this recipe.  My husband said it was the best he ever had, and now I am a convert.  I did substitute 2 cans crushed tomatoes and 1 tablespoon tomato paste for the tomato juice.  I also used Mexican Hot Chili Powder in place of the regular chili powder.  It was wonderful! Thank you.

We had our annual October bonfire with at least sixty people.  I made this in my crockpot and followed EXACTLY.  This was easy so I know I didn't screw it up.  Only 1/4 of it was gone at the end of the night.  I later found out that the reason why it didn't get eaten is because nobody "cared for it-it was missing something".  If at least half of the party tried it and didn't like it then that's 30 reviews.

This was pretty good.  I added some diced tomatoes with green chiles, used V-8 in place of plain tomato juice, brown sugar instead of white, and added jarred mushrooms.  Next time I will play with the chili powder amount a bit, as it was a bit spicy for my taste.  Overall, really good!

I was looking for the "perfect" chili recipe for our weekend football tailgater (Go Ducks!): the right balance of meat and beans, not too tomatoey or sweet, a little bit of kick but not too spicy, and easy to make in a crock pot overnight. This was it! Following others' suggestions, I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato juice. I also used 2 cans of pinto beans instead of 1 can of pinto and 1 can of kidney beans. EVERYONE loved it and I even got a couple of "this is the best chili I ever had"! Thanks!!!

I am a cook in the Coast Guard so I have to make enough to feed about 30 guys every day. I scaled up the recipe to 30 and followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did different was I left it cooking for about 2 1/2 hours to get more flavor out of everything. It was great!! All the guys loved it and it was the best chili I have ever had! Thanks for this one...I will deff be making this one again!!

we used turkey instead of beef and this still turned out delicious. we put a little extra cayenne in there and it was the perfect spicy-ness. And I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food. Thanks this was great!

Like other reviewers I skipped the tomato juice and added 3 15oz cans of rotel tomatos with peppers.  I also threw it in the crock pot.  Very tasty chili.  Thanks for the post.

Words cannot begin to describe this chili.  I took just about all of the suggestions from previous people and rolled them in to one fantastic pot-o-chili.  I added 3 diced habeneros, a can of dices jalepenoes, a can of dices tomatoes with green chilies, a lot of crushed red pepper and only about 3/4 of the can of tomato juice.  I did it up in the crock pot overnight for a potluck at work and my co-workers couln't get enough of it.  Great recipe will be using this one again!

WOW! This is fantastic chili! We make it here all the time and as someone said before it IS better the second day. We like to make it a bit spicier, but the basic recipe works really well. I would definitely recommend this. Thanks!

A very tasty, basic chili. This chili was good the first day; it was friggin' fantastic the second day. We served it with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits & chopped fresh onion & shredded cheddar cheese on top. I liked this chili because I knew everyone would like it. I also cut the recipe in half and still had plenty. Not a super thick chili, but nice textures and awesome taste. I'll try serving it over steamed white rice next time.

My family loves this recipe and I make it regularly.  I like to use buffalo instead of beef, and  black beans instead of pinto beans, but I've made it exactly the way it appears here and it's delicious!

this is absolutely yummy.  My husband loved it and requested it twice in one week, and he usually hates leftovers!  The only things I changed were:  added one can corn (drained), added garlic powder (1 tsp), added dried parsley (1/2 tsp), added hot sauce to give it a kick (1 tsp).
Also, when browning the ground beef, I added a little bit of ginger paste (1/2 tsp) to give a bit of flavor to the beef while its cooking.
Otherwise, this recipe is easy, and good.  I made mine in the slow cooker on high for 4-5 hrs and it was thick and fulfilling.

Very Good!  Here is what I changed.  First, instead of regular tomato juice, I used V8.  Plus I added one can of petite diced tomatoes in addition to the tomato sauce and 2 cans of beans.  I cooked the onion and green pepper with the hamburger.  Instead of all the individual spices, I just added a pack of  chili seasoning (guess that's sorta cheating!) It turned out great, even better with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream!

Excellent chili recipe!  I slow cooked for 8 hrs on Saturday, then again on Super Bowl Sunday and our friends loved it!  I used 16 oz of V8 instead of juice, and substituted the sauce with one can stewed tomatoes and one can original Ro-tel.  It was not too liquidy and not too thick.  I'll definately make this again.

Very good! The only thing I didn't like was it was a tad too liquidy. I think next time I will cut down on the amount of tomato juice. But other than that, it was perfect!

I had to keep out some of the tomato juice because the whole recipe would not fit in my large crock pot.  My small kids didn't like this recipe but the rest of my family enjoyed it.

This was a first time for me.  My husband has been asking for chili since Sept.  So, I perused the chili recipes available and thought this one sounded like a winner and... it WAS! He was in awe that it tasted so good the first night, the second night and lunch the next day!  The spice mixture is perfect.  The only thing different I will do next time is use shredded beef cooked in the crockpot all night before I make the chili the next day!  YUM!  Thank you!

Great chili.  Lots of flavor.  I just replaced one can of the beans with a can of corn and added a few more spices and made it into a mexican style treat.  I also only had stewed tomatoes on hand.  Oh yeah...try V8 spicy instead of the tomato juice. MMMMMMMMMMM!

This is a very good chili recipe.  It's very easy to make, mild enough for kids to eat, but spicy enough to be interesting.  It's not unique enough to get a 5-star rating, but I'll definitely make it again.  I would recommend adding more onions and peppers then the recipe calls for.  We added cheddar cheese and sour cream on top.  I wish that I made corn bread to go with it too.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I did change the amount of chili powder to 3TBS since I had Hot Mexican chili powder.  It turned out perfectly and everyone loves it.  We added shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and it was fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe George!

Awesome chili. I did not change a thing. I followed the directions and it was sooo good. My husband burned his mouth because he could not wait for it to cool some before eating it. Thanks!! This will be made again and again.

This chili is REALLY good!  I did miss the appearance of tomatoes, though, so I think I'll throw in some canned ones next time out.  Otherwise, it was stellar!

This is a simply outstanding chili recipe.  I will triple the amount of kidney beans in the future, but you can not go wrong here.  It is exactly what I was looking for, and what it should be.  THANK YOU GEORGE!!!!!

My husband and I loved this recipe! It made lots of very tasty, very thick chili (we used the diced tomatoes instead of the juice, as others recommended). It was very filling and had a nice amount of spice -- my husband isn't nuts about super-hot food, so we thought it was just right.

I made this recipe a few days beforehand to save time the night before. I cooked the ground beef, added all the ingredients to the crockpot and let it cook for 8 hours. I then froze it, and unthawed it the night before the cookoff. Put it BACK in the crockpot, and it turned out beautifully. I think the flavors might have done better because it had that day to meld.

This was awesome.  I used ground chicken and also substituted the tomato juice for a can of diced tomatoes and this is definitely a keeper.  Ground chicken is much healthier and didn't seem to change the taste too much...either way it was great.

I'm an experienced cook and thought that this was an excellent recipe!  Husband loved it!  I made minute changes - used about 1/8c less chili powder and it was still plenty hot - just right.  I had already started when I found I was out of oregano (imagine that), so I substituted sweet basil.  I loved it better than the oregano!!!!
An excellent and super easy recipe.  
Thanks George!

This was my 3rd time ever to make chili, the first 2 times didn't turn out too well, my husband hated it both times.  I swore that one day I would make a chili that would make him say, this is the best chili I have ever had.  I found George's recipe and followed it exactly, except I didn't add cumin, didn't have any.  Anyway, my husband tried it and didn't believe that I made it, after convincing him that I did make it, he said,  This is the best chili I have ever had.  Thank you so much George for this recipe.  I will use it from now on when I decide to make chili.

This is my favorite chili recipe!!! I make it in the slow cooker and serve it in bread bowls. It's the got the right amount of bite and the perfect consistency. I usually add some corn and chopped red peppers to it as well. Dee-lish!

A very good basic chili recipe that was easy to tweak to our liking.  Instead of 49 oz  tomato juice, I used one 29 oz can crushed tomatoes, along with the required 29 oz. tomato sauce.  The only other liquid I added was to rinse out the crushed tomato and tomato sauce cans with a bit of water and pour into pot (probably equaled 1 cup water).  I used two cans of pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  I  cooked meat, drained it, and sautéed veggies on stove.  Then put it all into a crock pot.  It was just the right consistency (a bit soupy, not too thick).  I will make this again.

There are probably as many recipes for homemade chili as there are stars in the sky. This one rates right up there with what the old Texas Cowboys had in mind when they created it back on the Old Chisolm Trail.

I made this the day before serving it to company, so let it blend together.  I did leave out the tomato juice and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a large can of  crushed tomatoes.  I, also, cut the chili powder in half.  Used my Cuisinart crockpot to brown the meat and then added all the ingredients once I drained the fat off.  Let it cook about 6.5 hours on low.  The next day, before serving it to our guests, I cooked it on the stovetop for 2 hours on low.  It got rave reviews and a request for the recipe.  
I will definitely make this again!

The only change I made was to use the canned tomatoes in their own juices in lieu of the tomato juice. I believe this helped with this chili turning out more hearty rather than liquidly. Will definitely make again!

I always follow a basic recipe....and this one is close to what I have been making out of my head for over 30 years.

Note:
One thing I have not 'seen' commented on so far is to take one can of Kidney beans and mash them with a potato masher till pulpy....this releases the protein in the bean. The other can I just add to the chili,  this also helps thicken the sauce.

Like the Italians, I add a half teaspoon of cinnamon. I also add some shredded carrot which disintegrates...more vitamins.

When browning the meat, I always add the chili powder to the meat....this is what I gleaned from East Indian cooking...and near the end of the meat cooking, I add 4 cloves of minced garlic, one diced onion and a palm full of dried oregano..(2 tbsp.)....and then finish browning the meat....browning meat slowly on lower heat gives a more tender meat in the chili.  I used to practically burn the meat ..... now I have learned to treat your meat tenderly and it will turn out tender.

I use large 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes & break them up a bit before adding everything to the slow cooker, plus a I add hefty can of tomato paste. (If I can get it - also 2 generous table spoons of concentrated Sundried Tomato Paste.)  I use brown sugar also.

Let this cook for 8 hours and if getting too thick, just add some hot water to get the desired consistency.

I serve this with shredded 'Mex-Tex' cheese on top or something like a nippy shredded cheddar.

Always have a sliced, warmed, loaf of French bread wit

I read the other reviews and also substituted the tomato juice with one can of diced tomatoes.  This recipe was fantastic and very easy to follow!  My sister-in-law said it was the best thing she has eaten all year! Thanks for sharing!

This is the "Wendys" chili recipe that is so easy to make.  I have made it numerable times.  My son always adds lots of hot sauce!  I always add garlic to any chili!

Excellent Chili Recipe.  We have small children so we left out the cayenne pepper and it was still very good.  With BEANS just the way Chili should be!!

Kind of had to adapt and improvise on this one. My wife doesn't like onions or garlic so I left those out. I used 1/2 the quantity of ground beef, 1/2 the amount of tomato juice and 1/2 of the above amount of chilI powder. I added 1 can (540 ml) of Mexican chili seasoned diced tomatoes. Slow cooked for 9 hours while away at work and came home to heaven.

I make a vegan version of this that's delicious. I use all of the same seasonings but double up on everything but the chili powder and cayenne (as noted in another review). Replace the beef with beef replacement crumbles. I like a chunkier, thicker chili so I also replace the tomato juice with 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I add in a little vegan worcestershire, a dash of liquid smoke, a can of black beans (makes it three bean chili) and sometimes a bag of frozen corn. It's delicious every time for a healthier version of this chili for vegans and non vegans alike!

Great base recipe.  Used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice. Cooked on the stove, I doubled the amount of cayenne and chili powder,  I also seasoned the meat with garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoned salt. It was delicious!

Love this recipe!  I've been making this for years.  I changed it slightly as suggested by other reviewers by using brown sugar instead of white and used Rotel and diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice.  I've made this chili on the stove top and also in the crockpot.  Both come out awesome!  This is the only chili recipe I use and friends ask for the recipe when they have it! Very easy to make. It's awesome! Thanks, George!

This chili is amazing! My husband and I are on a "healthy kick" so I made it with ground turkey (which I am not usually a fan of...at all) and it was wonderful. I can only imagine how good it would be with beef! 5 stars!!!

As others have mentioned, chili is one of those things that everyone has different ideas about. For me, this chili was just OK. Too much liquid in general and too tomatoey for my taste. I think I would have liked it better without the tomato sauce. I prefer a thicker, spicier chili with more emphasis on the flavor of the meat, beans and spices and less on tomato.

The first time I made the a few weeks ago, I was out of onions, so I added in a dry onion soup mix. Bad idea! It was too salty. I made it again for a church chili cook-off, this time with real onions, and so far looks great!

This recipe is soooooo tasty!  I nearly doubled the spices and added a can of black beans and about 1/2 bag frozen corn at the end. Most importantly, I substituted tri-tip seared on the George Foreman grill for 15 minutes, cut into 1-1/2 to 2 inch cubes, and I poured the searing juice in as well. Fantastic recipe, especially if you don't appreciate whole tomatoes in your chili. Just simmwr without a lid and the chili turns out thick. Yum yum.

I really love this recipe, Last year I won the chili cook off at my husbands squadron. It's a good base to start with, I make a few changes to it. I use 1lb ground beef and 1lb of ground pork. I also use more green peppers, chili powder, and cumin. I like to taste and adjust the flavor. This year I was thinking of how I could enhance it. I fried some thick cut smoked bacon and I added about a cup while it cooked. I also used some of the bacon as a topping. It was a really good idea, the family approved!

Great chili with some modifications. Replaced 1 can of tomato sauce with 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Doubled the use of cumin and cayenne peppers. Added 1/4 cup of salsa and 2 Chipotle peppers.  I would also suggest doubling the use of bell peppers for a heartier chili.

Didn't come out very spicy, but it was a great start. I will be adding much more hot stuff. I did the large can of whole peeled tomatoes and no other tomato product. But I realized it was a bit too dry midway through so I added about a half cup of water.  So I need to add tomato sauce next time.

Great flavor and texture! It was just spicy enough to make my nose run a bit, but not over the top.  Next time I might try to add a bit of cubed beef to add to the meatiness of it, but it's really good as-is!

Made this recipe for the folks at work and they enjoyed it. Followed the advice of others and substituted a large can of diced tomatoes, a can of V8 Hot n Spicy, and a little more sauce. Used New Mexico chili powder as well. This was a great meal and will be made often in the winter months.

As simple as it is....we love this recipe!  Great cold weather weekend confort dish.  Seems to strike the right balance between the savory,heat,and tomato flavors.  Serve it with some shredded cheddar or monterey jack cheese with some tortilla chips.  Yum!   We have found that this recipe can be used with leftover holiday turkey substituted for the ground beef with equally good results.

I made this exactly as directed and I have never had a better experience with chili in my entire life.  And in case you ever have any left over, it freezes nicely in vacuum sealed bags.  Wonderful, marvelous chili.

I have been making this recipe for probably two years now!! I absolutely love it, my family loves it, husband's co workers request it and friends come over just to get some! It is such a delicious recipe and you can add or subtract anything you want to it! I always add a jalapeno and diced tomatoes! I even use all organic ingredients which make it even tastier!! Thank you for the recipe I searched for a long time for a perfect one and finally found it :)

Awesome!!!!
We used tomato sause instead of tomato juice. I doubled this for a crowd and used four different kinds of beans: chili beans, kidney beans, pinto beans and black beans. Everyone loved it!

Great flavored chili. Found this chili when i was trying to use up my tomato juice. Only had half a can left so used that, jammed the other ingredients besides green peppers and beans because I love them. I panicked when I forgot to half most of the seasonings but it turned out delicious. Also, I've tried with fresh tomatoes and some tomato paste because I was trying to get rid of tomatoes. I'm realizing after writing it down his many changes i made, but it was what i had.

Made this today for the wife. Only change I made was doubling the kidney beans as the wife dislikes pinto beans. This became an instant family favorite. Will surely make this again. Thanks!!

If you make it in the slow cooker it comes out too soupy. I'd recommend using half as much of the tomato juice if you're doing the slow cooker. I transferred mine to a pot and let it simmer to thicken it up. It is tasty and incredibly easy to prepare.

My go-to chili recipe.  With 3 in the house that do not like chunky chili, this is by far the only recipe they gobble up immediately.  Flavorful, smooth, and delicious!

Great recipe. My first time making chili. Was never a chili fan until this recipe. I used a can of crushed tomatoes and added the dry ingredients in the blender with it to make sure it was mixed well. I sauté the onions and peppers first before adding in the pot. I will note that it had way to much kick for my kids(only reason for 4 stars), so I will tone that down a little. But my stepson LOVED it. He actually added Tabasco sauce to some that was left over, & said this is it!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will make this again.

Family loved it! I used a little less tomato juice than the recipe called for and no onions because my hubby doesn't like onions. I cooked it in my crock pot for about 10 hours. Absolutely delish!

Delicious! Being a chili lover I changed it up a bit. Used 1.25 lbs ground beef w/ .67 lbs italian sweet sausage. added 1 can 28 oz diced tomatoes, 1/2 c. celery & 2 cloves garlic (because i had in fridge) and didn't have tomato juice so substituted another 24 oz sauce instead & 1/2 jar leftover salsa (from fridge).  Was a little spicy for the ppl who don't do hot stuff (i admit the amount of chili powder looked like a lot); but still rich, hearty, thick and very good. Definitely better the 2nd day.

Other than tomato juice, had all other ingredients on hand (love a recipe like that).  Used a can of mixed beans that included pinto beans.  This is the best chili I have ever made.  Thank you!

Very good!  Even with only an hour to cook.  I'm sure it will be better tomorrow.  I read a lot of reviews before and while cooking.  We don't care for tomato juice so I substituted a 10 oz can of Rotel and two 12 oz bottles of hard cider.  I scaled the chili powder back to 3 tbspns and upped the cumin to 2 tbspns.  I added 2 tsp of chopped garlic while cooking the meat and doubled the pinto beans and added a can of black beans as well (we really like beany chili). At the end I threw in some organic dark chocolate, about the same amount as two Hershey kisses, just for the mellowness.  I ate it with a tbspn of sour cream and a sprinkle of Mexican mixed shredded cheese and a green salad with ranch dressing.
The spice is now just right for me, but my son added some of our homemade taco seasoning.  Oh, and he just came back for another bowl.  
This recipe has made me rethink a recent decision - I had to replace my old crockpot and because it's only the two of us, I bought a 3 qt.  I can see that I will need to get a larger pot. (very big grin!)
FYI - a very gluten-free friendly recipe!

I have two chili's that I make. This one for quick and easy but still tastes great and a different one for hearty and meaty. SO if you are looking for just a simple good tasting chili this one is great. Also, follow the recipe don't tinker. whenever I follow it exactly it tastes great, If I tinker...well its always missing something

Wasn't our favorite although we did substitute some of the tomato juice with vegetable juice because we didn't have enough. Was too blame and boring. We'll try another recipe next time.

Great recipie.  I read other reviews and added some of the suggest items like cocoa powder, extra cayenne.  I also added 2 tbs of corn meal about 10 minutes before done cooking.  It helps thicken it.  Just before serving I threw in a can of whole kernel corn!  Yummy!  Thanks George!

Just like other reviewers, I played around with this.  I doubled all spices except the chili powder, added two adobo chilis in their sauce, and left out the green pepper (just don't like it). VERY yummy.  Serve it over macaroni, and I always add a little shredded cheddar. Mmm.

Usually, I just hate when people review recipes when they haven't followed them in the least, and instead they are really just posting their own recipe in a "review". However, when it comes to chili, sometimes that's what you have to do. It's just one of those dishes where anything can go into it, and you have room to play.
I was looking for a mild crowd pleasing chili for a family that I'm bringing a meal to, and they have kids, so I knew it couldn't be a spicy chili. I saw this one and it looked like it fit the bill, so decided to try it. Like other reviewers, I didn't have any tomato juice, so I used canned diced tomatoes in place of the juice. And if you sub out the juice, then you need to add some salt to the mix.  I also added one finely chopped jalepeno pepper for some kick, and instead of the pinto beans, I added two cans of mild chili beans.  Other than that, I followed the recipe. Even with the jalepeno, it's quite mild.  I think it's missing something, but it could be because I used the canned tomatoes instead of the tomato juice? So, I can't really rate it fairly because of that, but it is good. I wouldn't put a "wow" anywhere in the description, but you definitely can't go wrong with this, so at least you won't get any "yucks" either. Next time I'll try it exactly as written, juice and all.

Really good base recipe. I used just a SMIDGE less chili powder because my family is not a fan of super-spicy food and I wanted to play it safe. Came out great, a bit of a bite without being overwhelming. Could definitely adjust flavors to your tastes, but this is a great basic recipe to start from.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now & everyone loves it!!! The only thing I've changed is replacing tomato juice with Zing Zang & adding chopped stewed tomatoes. It's even better the next day!!!

This is my go-to chili recipe from now on! Made it for a party & everyone raved about it!!! I didnt use as much tomato juice but added canned crushed tomatoes because I love chunks of tomatoes in my chili. So delicious!!! We do our chili served over rice & topped with shredded cheddar cheese, chopped green onions, sour cream, sriracha and a piece of corn bread on the side.

This was awesome! Nice little spice kick with the exact spices from the ingredient list. Not unbearable spice -just right. I decided to omit the pinto beans because my other half isn't too keen on beans-(the kidney beans were suffice!!) I also added taco seasoning mix & garlic for extra flavor! I would suggest lessening the amount of tomato juice-it was a bit runny-overall it was fantastic. The smell & taste aligned.

We love the recipe. I sub an extra can of sauce and a large can of diced tomatoes for the juice. Plus I add two diced jalapeños and a little extra cayenne pepper. Gives it a great kick but not too spicy.

I love this recipe.  The only "problem" I have is that it's be tougher in the last year or so to find the canned tomato juice.  The only major chain of stores in my part of Los Angeles that carry it is Ralph's.  I usually buy a couple when I see it on sale.

The spices in this recipe are great. I added a bit more cayenne and a dash of onion powder, too. Also, I did as other reviewers suggested, to cook the onions with the meat, to which I added 3 cloves of garlic. (I add garlic to everything) This recipe is a perfect base or as is. Dee-lish!

Good chili. I only used 32oz. of tomato juice, 16 oz. of tomato sauce and one 15 oz. can of chili tomatoes since I like a thick chili. I also added an extra can of pinto beans. It was great-not too spicy but had a good flavor. The wife even had seconds, which is rare for a chili meal.

This is my first time making chili. I read some of the reviews but decided I'd stick as close as I could to the recipe. I loved it as is! The only thing is I didn't have tomato juice, I had vegetable juice, so I did add a few small tomatoes and only about 28 oz of the juice, I like my chili to be a little thick. I cooked mine in a slow cooker for 8 and a half hours and then I turned it to high for another thirty minutes without the lid for it to thicken up. Loved it! I will be making this again :)

Great chilli, made it for a Halloween party in a crockpot (cooking on low for about eight  hours), and it was gone within the hour. We reduced the beef (ground sirloin) to 1.5 pounds and added one extra can of kidney beans, and all the comments I received were that it was perfect ration of meat to beans (if you like things really meaty, leave the ratio as written). I doubled all the spices and upped the sugar to 3T of brown sugar. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have one around, and it wasn't missed. For the tomato portion, I'd imagine nearly anything you have in the fridge would work, including salsa. I used four ripe garden tomatoes (from our very last harvest), chopped, and 1 can of tomato paste diluted with 4 cans water.

I had never made red chili before and was a little surprised and dubious that it was all tomato based.  I took a leap based on the ratings and I'm glad I did.  The family enjoyed it for dinner and a couple of lunches afterwards.  The fact that it is in the crockpot only adds to this great starter chili recipe.  Watch the spice if you are sensitive to heat as my daughter is.  Enjoy!

Great easy recipe! I'm a beginner cook and this recipe was great. I browned the beef like it said than added it all in my crock pot on high for 4.5 hours and low for about an hour. Used less onion and subbed some onion powder as my husband hates onion and I like them. Also added some sweet corn from a can just because and it tasted great. Has a little kick to it so if you don't like spicy things or even mildly spicy cut back on the cayenne. You could really add whatever veggies you desire like potatoes etc for a great hearty chili. Next time ill be sure to have some corn bread ready to eat with this!

When I feel like chili, I use this as one of two basic recipes. It is simplistic in nature, which is exactly what you want when making chili. Of course, everyone will season to taste and make it there own, but it will be hard to find a better start, than what you see here. Though, I'm sure you have tweaked it a hundred times by now yourself, good job George and thanks for sharing.

 Remember readers, when it becomes too gourmet, it ceases to be chili.

This is by far my favorite chili recipe. I crave it all winter! The only change I make is omitting the juice, because I like thick chili. I also sometimes use just a pound of meat if I'm cooking for 2 instead of a whole group. It's amazing!

OMG! This is GREAT Chili! From reading the reviews I decided to make a couple of changes. First I traded the tomato juice for bloody Mary mix, one bottle. Then since my wife is not a fan of green peppers. I trade that for two ingredients. Fire roasted chili peppers, 10oz. and 10 oz. of cooked green cactus, both drained. This will definitely be saved and cooked again.
Thank you George!

This was the first Chili I've ever made and was afraid nobody would like it, I think I'm a pretty good cook, so does my husband , and 2 out of 4 kids!  I doubled the recipe added a can of creamed corn and a few tablespoons of garlic,white kidney beans and a little beef broth.Served it with honey cornbread muffins. It came out pretty amazing. Everyone loved it. Will make again for sure. This is a great base for a chili.

I made this recipe this morning and it turned out great! I did make a few modifications after reading some of the reviews. I added 1 tsp of garlic and only added half of the required tomato juice and replaced with some homemade salsa and stewed tomatoes for thickness. I served mine with garlic toast with a handful of sharp cheddar over the chili! I agree with many of the other reviews that this is a recipe that should be tampered with to serve your individual preferences on thickness/spices etc. But a great base to start with! Will definitely be making again!

This chili recipe has become the go to chili recipe in my household. It's absolutely fantastic! The only thing I change is add some chopped tomato to the mix just because I like that. Otherwise, perfect. I normally make a batch and freeze them in single serve containers.

OMG, thank you George! This is the chili base that I have been looking for forever!!! I left out the kidney beans, pinto beans and bell pepper since I don't like them. I added noodles because I like those in my chili and it turned out great! I cooked it in the crock pot for about 8 hours and it was perfect -- wasn't runny at all! Love it and can't wait to make it again!

I dont normally like chili but my husband loves it so I decided to try this recipe. And wow! I thought this was really good! Husband said it could use a little more heat but I thought it was just right. Only changes I made was instead of the tomato juice, I used canned diced tomatoes and then instead of pinto beans, used black beans (just a preference). Will definitely make again!

Very hearty recipe.  When I was pouring in the tomato juice, it seemed like an awful lot, so I used 36 oz instead of the 46 called for. Did not come out watery after 4hours in the slow cooker. Will definitely make this again.

By George,I really like this chili. No tomato juice so I used V8 juice, and used only 1/16 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and upped the cumin another teaspoon. Will be my main recipe for chili for now on. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both thought that this was an extremely acidic chili. I followed the directions exactly. I think that I might try a bit more sugar if I make this again. Thank you for sharing!

I have made this since first found recipe, I adjust it some with the following... onion soup mix, can of diced tomatoes, celery and I use ground turkey instead of the ground beef(since the price of beef is getting to be a joke) I paid  $ 1.50 for 1 lb roll of ground turkey. All this gets added to the above recipe. We so enjoy it ! Thanks to George Couch

This made a great bowl of chili, but I did make quite a few changes to it.  I left out the pinto beans; felt it was too excessive with the beans and my family prefers kidney.  I left out the tomato juice and replaced it with 1 cup of hot water, which I added beef boullion and some worchestershire sauce to.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies.  I did not have any cumin or cayenne, so I replaced these with paprika (which I added generously) and red pepper flakes.  It tasted a little off, so a touch extra of salt and pepper did the trick.  My family really loved it!

I used to make chili by using the chili season packets.  It was always too salty.  My kids would only eat a bowl.  With this recipe, my family eats it until it's gone.  I never have leftovers to freeze.  It has enough spices without tasting so salty.  This is the best chili recipe ever.

This was a good chili! The only thing I changed was that I only used about half of the tomato juice and that was perfect for the amount of meat and beans.

This is a great recipe. I left out the onion and pepper, and instead of all the individual spices I added two packets of Chili seasoning plus the sugar and some garlic. So good and perfectly flavorful. I didn't think it was too soupy, although it was in the crock pot for about 8 hours. Yum!

This is a great starter recipe as everyone says, especially because of how little prep time is involved.  I substituted a 28 oz can of diced or crushed tomatoes instead of the juice and sauce, and the result was great.  I also omitted the bell pepper, eyeballed the spices, adding a few more from other recipes, including Worcester sauce, onion powder, garlic powder and sage.  It wasn't very flavorful to me at first, and the trick is to add in as much spices as your mouth will allow for that explosion on your tongue flavor.

Fantastic! I didn't measure the spices (cayene, oregano, pepper, salt, and cumin) Just added it till it "smelled" right. I probably added more that it called for, but it sure tasted great!

Definitely runny cooked in crock pot. Also need a little kick to it.  Chipotle peppers and substitute tomato juice with canned tomatoes.

Love this recipe. Changes that I made were:
1.25 lb lean beef, 2 no salt diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice, 2 15 ounce cans of reduced sodium kidney and pinto beans, 2 cups onions, 1/4 tsp cayenne and oregano, 1 tsp ground cumin. All other ingredients and method of cooking remained the same. This last time I cooked on the stove due to time contraints. Its my go to =)

This is the only chili recipe I use!  I don't alter the recipe to suit my taste, but rather to what's in the pantry.  My favorite changes are doubling the spices except for cayenne, adding a can of diced tomatoes, and using dried beans that I soak.  I think the chili is great with or without the tomato sauce or less tomato juice; it's just so versatile!  I usually make this on the stove, but there have been weekends where I set up the crock-pot and the whole house smells wonderful!

Loved this recipe! Made it for the first time today and only made a few modifications. Omitted the tomato juice. Added (2) 10 oz cans tomatoes with green chilies and (1) 14 oz can diced regular tomatoes. Added (1) extra can of red kidney beans. Omitted green pepper as I didn't have any on hand. Cooked on the stove top for 2 1/2 hours and served with sour cream, tortilla chips and bread with butter! THIS IS A KEEPER!!!!

Great Recipe.  I'm a chef for a golf course, perfect for a chilly golf day.  I did not have any tomato juice so I subbed with Zing Zang Bloody Mary Mix.  The mix has great herbs & spices, gave it a little more zip! Freezed well.

This chili was awesome!  Only change I made was adding minced garlic.  Can't have chili without garlic in it :-)  Had it with Uncle Ben's rice.  Best chili I've ever had!  Thank you, George, for sharing.

I tweaked this recipe a bit, I added a can of V-8 juice instead of tomato juice, smoked hot paprika and a handfull of dehydrated vegetable soup mix I got in the bulk foods, two cloves of chopped garlic and beef broth...oh yeah...I cooked it in the pressure cooker, man it was so good!!! I cooked the beans with the broth and onion first, then browned the meat and added the bell pepper, garlic and spices to the beans and pressure cooked it again for 10 mins. The beans cooked in one hour. I will never make my chili any other way.

Excellent basic recipe to do with as you please!  This is where I will start from from now on.  I really loved this and I only added a few extras.  My extras:  a couple of cloves of garlic, a generous dose of Worcestershire sauce, and a about a cup and a half of red wine!  Yum!  Also, I caramelized the onions right before I browned the beef.  And I used dry beans that I soaked and cooked rather than canned.  I thought the huge crock pot of chili it made would last a while, but my family has just been sucking it down and it will be gone in no time!  :-)

Made in a slow cooker according to recipe, but subbed cubed NY strip for the ground beef.  I was afraid it wasn't going to thicken up, so I turned it on high & left the lid off for the last 2 hours or so.  VERY good chili!

This  was sooo good. I was still eating it after a week and it was just as good. Will make again. I used canned diced tomato instead of tomato juice.

This is an awsome chili recipe you can do so much with this, depending on how you make this, you can add and subtract what you want i went by what it called for added green pepper and celery and brown sugar. I also add a can of refried beans to thicken it up but did not use the pinto i used red kedney and dark kedney beans. Oh also i did not use cayenne pepper and it was still very good not spicy at all. You can feed this to kids as well as older people...

I am a native Texan.  Never ever ever ever put beans in chili or it becomes what we call "stew".  Rest of the stuff sounds okay.

I put less meat in, but followed all the other ingredients and prep and it was awesome chili.  Just a little kick, so if you need a hot chili you'll want to add more cayenne. I made it for the employees at work (20+) and all were asking for the recipe!

Great Recipe!!! I modified it with Chili Beans instead of Pintos and added two cans of chili ready tomatoes and a can of stewed tomatoes (we reeeeeeaaaallly like tomatoes). In the future I'll probably double the amount of beans to thicken it up, other than that it was the best I ever made!

By George, I FINALLY got it!  My family has endured YEARS of failed chili attempts and reluctantly tried this one -- but THIS ONE WAS A HIT!  Their exact words were "YUMMY, this is it!!"  In lieu of the tomato juice, I used tomato paste, skipped all peppers (to remain kid friendly), and used about 4 tbsp of brown sugar instead of the white sugar. I also added corn, black and white beans, and a dash of liquid smoke.  The chili was delicious and thick and hearty. Thanks a lot, George!  We truly appreciate you.

I have never made chili before. This was pretty good. A little too tomatoey for me. Not spicy at all. I would have liked it to be more spicy and have more beans. I made it in the slow cooker. It didn't come out as thick as I thought it would. I followed the recipe exactly.

A quick easy chili recipe that you can make per the recipe or you can spice up with a can of rotel. We have made this recipe a few times. It also freezes well if you want to make alot and put some up for the next week.

This is a good base to start a really good chilli. Personally  prefer to add in more ingrediants. For instanace theres this awesome Mexican place in town. We'll order burritos and they are always so big. I brought them home, chopped them up, and tossed them in my chilli. Tortialla shells and all. Made for an aesome chilli

I made a few minor changes. First, I did 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. italian sausage because it was cheaper. Second, I used just all tomato sauce and no tomato juice. Turned out incredible!

I love this recipe!!!! And so did my Husband and mother (who critics EVERYTHING!) LOL I changed a couple of things like doubling all spices and adding soy sauce to my meat while cooking it. Also added sweet chopped peppers. Can also be made as a Turkey chili! Just replace the beef with turkey! Thanks for such a great recipe!

My husband tasted this and said, "by far your best batch of chili yet.". I adjusted the recipe as others did to: 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 can (14.5oz) tomato sauce, and only 8 oz of tomato juice.  Perfect consistency (nice and thick, not too runny).  Thanks George!

This is my go-to chili recipe and has been for years!  It's very hearty and thick.  If you'd like it a little soupier, then let it simmer in a Dutch oven with the lid on for an hour or so.  Delicious!

Great Base for chilli!  Huge family hit, I added stewed tomatoes and diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice also I cooked 1lb burger and 1lb Italian sausage with 1/2 cup onions and 1 garlic clove and I added another garlic clove to the chilli itself.  We will be having this again!

I have made this chili many times and I love it! I use v8 juice and sometimes use sausage instead of beef. It always turns out great! Met rave reviews for guys poker night!

I've been making this chili for the past 6 years for a neighborhood Halloween party and everyone LOVES it - little kids to adults!  Sometimes I use a ground beef/sausage combo or add different kinds of beans.  It's a very adaptable recipe with a rich, heaty flavor without big chunks of tomato. YUM!

Perfect chili recipe. I added an extra pound of meat because it seemed like a lot of liquids......perfect blend of seasonings!

Pretty good, exceptionally easy chili. Could have used a bit more heat but that can be addressed on a per-bowl basis.

Delicious... I made a few changes. Instead of the tomato juice, I used 1 can diced tomatoes (with juice), and I used 2 cans kidney beans (since I prefer them over pinto beans). I omitted the green pepper, only because I didn't have it on hand. It was absolutely delicious. This is my chili staple.

Wow, what a great recipe!  I did cut the tomato juice in half and make it up with beef broth to cut the acidity.  The only down side of this recipe is when I normally make chili, I have it left for days.  This recipe got eaten up the first day.

This is really good chili. Almost as good as my grandmothers. The only changes I made was to use half the tomato juice and doubled the tomato sauce (to make it thicker). Next time I would also add extra bell pepper and double the cayenne pepper. Thanks for posting :-)

This is a wonderful chili recipe, it has a a great flavor and is quite simple to put together. I've made it several times for large groups and everyone raved about how delicious it was. Sometimes I make it with all beef and other times 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground beef. Equally delicious! Thanks for a superb recipe George!

My chili turned out GREAT!  I was a little leery of adding all that tomato juice so I added a big can of diced tomatoes instead.  But once I got everything in the pot it needed some thinning out so I added some low-sodium V-8 juice and a little water and that seemed to work.  However, the next time I make this I will use the plain tomato juice to see how it turns out.  I omitted the cayenne pepper entirely  and added a 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I also added about 3-4 diced chipotle peppers plus some of the sauce they came in to add a smokiness flavor.

Made exactly as directed and came out perfect.  I simmered about an hour and 15 minutes before my family digged in.  The seasonings came out perfect, not too strong for the kid and just right for my husband and I.  This was not soupy for us.  We really liked the consistency it had.

Five stars for superlative flavor!  A bit on the soupy side, maybe too much tomato juice.  I tried to sop it up by adding more beans.  Worked out fine--and by the next day the chili was actually too dry!

This was a good recipe...but we prefer it with some tweaks:  next time, I'll double the onion and add some garlic, and decrease the chili powder, and eliminate the cayenne.  (I've got young kids and it was too much spice for them)

Easily one of the best chili recipes that I've ever tried in my life. For the most part I follow the recipe exactly, except I don't put in the tomato juice, I use two cans of diced or crushed tomatos.

ETA  I made this a second time and followed the recipe to a T and the chili was soupy and very salty.  Next time I make it I will use the oops recipe I used the first time I made it.  I wasn't paying attention to the recipe and used tomato sauce instead of tomato juice.  I added two cans of water to try and make up for my mistake.  I also doubled the oregeno and cumin.  This was the best chili I have ever made.

I made this as directed and while the flavor is OK, this was way too thin for us.  I think I'd try this again leaving out the tomato juice and using diced tomatoes in its place.  I'm sure the leftovers will be thicker and even tastier.  UPDATE: The leftovers were a little thicker, but the flavor wasn't much improved.  Hubby asked me not to make this again.

Very good!  I only used 3/4 of the amount of tomato juice and added a dark beer as well as some garlic

Simple and easy.  Made it in my slow-cooker, and it was ready when I came home.  A little bland for those who like spice.  Suggest tinkering with the spices a bit.

This chili was the best I'd had, but my taste buds wanted a bit more. It was a bit juicy for my taste. I like a full chili with an equal amount of beef, beans, and a little kick. So we decided to make it again, with our own twist.   When we made it the second time, it was "delicioso" (as my 2 year old put it.) Here's what we added to the original recipe:  One extra pound of beef,  2 more cans of beans (one each),  1 can of Rotel,  8 more oz tomato sauce and 16 oz water,  a couple extra dashes of all the seasonings,  and we used an entire onion and green bell pepper.  We ate some after 2 hours of simmering, and decided to let it go for an extra hour. It would still be good in the original timeframe, but I guess the key to chili is in the simmer time.   When it was in the bowls ready to eat we topped it off with some saltines and a bit of shredded cheese. Also tried some cornbread with it, which was also good.  We had a lot leftover, so be ready to feed quite a few, eat chili for a week, give some away, or freeze a bit (haven't tried this one yet.) Enjoy!

I made this for my graduation party and it was so easy to assemble! I didn't have a lot of time and this was perfect. I didn't get to have any at the party but my friends and family raved about it. I put it on eggs the next morning and it rocked!

This is a great chili.  It's the kind of chili a man says "I've been cooking this chili for 40 years".  But it's not the chili that says "I've been winning chili contest for 40 years".  A very, very good chili that even the kids like, but it's not a unique tasting chili.

Love this recipe! It is so quick and easy for a delicious dinner when you don't have much time. I at least double the sugar, because it was a little spicy and I like my chili a little sweeter. And I also add a bit of cornmeal. YUM!

First chili recipe I have ever made. It was delicious!! I followed the directions perfectly and cooked it on the stove in a large pot.  It was only for my husband and I so we have tons left over. I will freeze half. I will make this again for sure.  I made this with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site which was amazing too! Overall- a wonderful dinner

I love this recipe.  I had no idea how to make chili, as sad as that sounds, and I can't Thank you enough for helping me out with it.  My Newly Wed husband says Thank you for helping me make a dinner he can actually eat and even looks forward to.  This has become a staple part of our weekly routine.  I wouldn't change a thing!

If you are making this for a diverse audience, this may be the recipe you need. I made this for a church function, one that I had not intended for my husband to attend, but he did.  My husband groans at the sight of chili, but for appearance sake, he took the bowl that was offered and joined the crowd. The next day he asked me if there were any leftovers?!  I was shocked! When I said no, he asked me to make it again soon. I felt I needed to share this with others who may have picky husbands.  I followed the recipe pretty much as written. I added diced tomatoes as others had suggested and seasoned my beef as I was frying it up. Having cooked it in the crock overnight, it was a little soupy so I transfered it to a stockpot and let it simmer (cook off the extra) for a couple of hours as I had the time.  If you don't you can boil it faster, just remember to stir.  In the past I have made a roux, using the juice from the chili to thicken it up, this does not alter the taste of the chili.  The heat of this chili recipe can be modified to suit your audience.  Great recipe, thanks so much!

Delicious! I give it 4 stars as written. I made a few changes. Instead of 2 lbs of beef, I used 1 lb beef and 1 lb ground sausage, I used V8 instead of plain tomato juice, I also added 1 can of mushrooms and a small can of green chilis. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have one on hand, and I didn't use onion because my boyfriend doesn't like them. I just got this in my slow cooker and tasted it cold and it was great, so I know it will be even better tonight! Yum!

very good, i did as others said and mixed up a double batch of seasoning.  i didn't use the whole double amount just 3/4 and it came out very chili-ish.  hot!!!  ate with cheese, noodles, potatoes, sour cream, nachos, just about anything i thought would go well with chili.  froze the little bit that was left over and will eat that next week.  will def make again, this time i'll season it the way the directions stated.

Yummy - a family favorite! We like heat in my family so we add extra cayenne and a de-seeded jalapeno (or other hot peppers) when we make it.  To make it easier on our budget we use ground turkey instead of beef and only add 1 pound instead of two.  I don't notice a difference when the meat is decreased since this is a such a thick and hearty chili already. We don't use tomato juice (since we never use it and never have it around) and substitute in one 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes (liquid and all).  To me tomatoes are the star of any chili - they just absorb so much flavor and burst with goodness in your mouth - it's rather strange this recipe doesn't include them in the first place.  After I have all the ingredients in the crock pot I add enough tomato sauce to cover all (usually three 15 oz. cans).  The seasonings are perfect as they are but I've cut the chili powder down to 1/8 cup without noticing a difference in taste.  It may seem strange to cut back on chili powder to help the budget but this is a weekly meal through the winter months for us (in Minnesota that's like 8 months too, lol) and we use a lot of chili powder in a few different meals.

**UPDATE**

I won a chili cook-off with this recipe!  I used the same changes I always do (listed above) and mine won for the best red chili!  Can't wait until next year to defend my crown.  ;-)

I substituted undrained diced tomatoes for the tomato juice and used one can each kidney, pinto, and chili beans. This was a big hit during the blizzard last weekend. I could have used more heat, but I just added some hot sauce to mine after the fact since not everyone likes spice. I would definitely make this again.

This is excellent chili!! I have made this at least 4 times in the past month for family...it is a favorite! I use brown sugar instead of white, double the cayenne pepper, and use canned diced tomatoes in their juices to keep the texture chunkier. Also, I crunch up Tostidos chips on top, sprinkle grated sharp cheddar cheese on top of the chips, and zap it in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the cheese...yummy! My family and I will definitely keep a container on hand in the fridge/freezer during the winter!!

I made this today for my mini super bowl party and it was a hit!  I was a little worried because it seemed a bit runny at first, but when I turned down the heat and kept the lid off it thickened up nicely!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

The best chili I've ever had! I had homemade tomatosauce on hand (made from crushed tomatoes) so it had lots of garlic which I think added to the taste. I only had 30 ounces, so I also added some beefbroth and 2 cans of diced tomatoes (no tomato juice at all). Everything else stayed the same as the original recipe. I'm glad I used only 1/8 tsp of Cayenne as written since that was just enough spice for me. Anything more would have been too much. Can hardly wait for the leftover tomorrow.

This was amazing. After reading several of the reviews, I decided omit the tomato juice altogether, and I added (2) 14.5 oz cans of diced tomato's. I also added some celery, red bell pepper, and garlic. I took it to a footall party w/ 10 people, and the pot was empty by the time the two games were over. There was a lot of food, but the chili was the main attraction.  Thanks George! Will be making this again soon.

Seeing as to how I don't like chili, I guess I can't really give an opinion, but I made this for my husband, and he absolutely LOVED it! One of the best chili recipes he's ever come across. We also brought some over to my parents house for leftovers and they said it was fantastic!

I like my chili with a little kick so I made a few changes:  Instead of using the full 46oz of tomato juice, I used only 15oz tomato juice + two 15oz cans of diced tomatoes undrained (in addition to the 29oz of tomato sauce) to make it more hearty like others suggested.  The consistency came out perfect, not too liquidy, not to thick, but still I think next time I might use only 7 or 8 oz of tomato juice.  Also, I skipped the kidney beans and used a 40oz can of pintos that had some jalapenos in it (usually in the mexican food aisle at the grocery store).  And, instead of bell peppers, I used 1/2 cup of chopped jalapeno peppers which I fried with the ground beef and onions.  I would've used more jalapenos but my wife can't handle it! LOL  Lastly, I used a full teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of only an 1/8th.    It came out great...my wife was able to handle it just fine and it was spicey, but not to the point where it burns your mouth.  It had a nice kick to it.  Great recipe as-is or to customize it just the way you like it!

I just love this recipe! Whenever the family requests chili for dinner, I know where to turn! I dont change a thing in this recipe.  If you want less of a "bite" dont use as much chili powder.

Fabulous! I like more heat in my chili... so i added crushed red pepper and my favorite hot sauce... Cholula :) Great with a dollop of sour cream and cheddar cheese sprinkled on top!

This was a great base recipe.  After I browned the meat I cooked up a bunch of veggies...mushrooms, onion, garlic, jalapeno, carrots and zucchini.  I didn't use the tomato juice and used brown sugar for the white sugar.  I also used a can of petite diced tomatoes.  Hubby loved!

This is my go to chili recipe.  I like it because it is very basic.  It is very conventional.    While I often tvariations of chili recipes (adding brown sugar, different peppers, etc), this one is kind of a staple.  It won't let you down.

This recipe is definitly five stars.  I make it almost every time we have a family get together and it's always a hit. I prefer it soupier so I like the amout of tomato juice it calls for.  I put out fritos, sour cream and cheese to serve with it.

i am a beginner cook and everyone in my family loved this recipe. even my little bro who detests beans and green peppers ate this without a peep. there weren't any leftovers. i did substitute the tomato juice for another large can of tomato sauce to make it a little soupier and tweaked the spices to accomodate.very easy and very delicious.

This is an aweome recipe for chili.  I made the tweaks recommended by Capemom77. I think her suggestion of substituting 3 Tbsp of brown sugar for the white sugar was terrific, and also double the non-spicy spices.  This recipe is much simpler than some of the others on the site and just as good.

This tasted almost exactly like Wendy's chili.  Just so happens that Wendy's chili is my favorite!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I accidently used Crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and I added just a bit of garlic.  Perfect!

I like chunks of tomato so I use tomato sauce instead of juice and diced tomatoes in sauce instead of tomato sauce.  This is so simple to just throw together.  It has the right amount of spice for me and is great as leftovers!

Agree with everyone -- an excellent starting point for personalizing chili. I added a 10oz. can of Rotel and subtracted 10oz. from the tomato juice. I used chili beans instead of pinto beans and brown sugar instead of white. I cooked in a crock pot and it was a bit runny, so I cooked with the lid off for the last hour or so, which helped thicken it up.

I have never made chili before, and this was Delicious...I used ground turkey, and could not tell the difference.  I also used diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice as others suggested.  Thank you for a great recipe :-)

Absolutely delicious. I changed it up a bit because I like my chili chunky and did not add as much tomato juice and no tomato sauce.

This is a great chili by itself or if you like to experiment. I've made this recipe as is and it was very good! The next time I changed a couple things... I used about half the amount of tomato juice, replaced the white sugar with brown sugar, and left out the green peppers (my bf doesn't like them). To add some more spice and experiment I added spicy Italian sausage, red pepper flakes, and a dash of cocoa powder. I gave this 5 starts because even though I changed a few things, it was the original recipe that was the foundation.

Great recipe! I made it for my family tonight for dinner and it was a hit. I made a kid-friendly pot, minus the onions, diced tomatoes and beans, and they loved it over corn chips. I made the regular recipe, omitting the tomato juice and using brown sugar rather than white sugar. I also used one tomato boullion cube. Served with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. Very filling! Thanks George!

I loved this recipe, and I guess everyone else did too, because mine was the only crockpot at the party that was empty! I did substitute the tomato juice for 2 cans of plum tomatoes, and diced them myself.... it was perfect.

This was a really good chili recipe.  I cooked mine on the stove because I didn't want to wait all day! ;)  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Loved it!! I wanted a hearty chili so based on other reviews I used diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice.  I also used two cans of kidney beans (omitting the pinto beans) and a jar of salsa for a special kick.  Oh my goodness this chili was soooo good!

This chili is fantastic! I have tried to make chili in the past and it always turns out so bland and boring.  This recipe has a great ingredient list and is easy to make.  I followed other users' suggestions and substituted diced tomatoes for the tomato juice for a thicker chili.  I also used a red bell pepper instead of green.  Made it in the crockpot and it turned out great!  I will definitely make this again.

I followed other's advice and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. I also used 2 cans of kidney beans instead of pintos. I simmered stovetop for 2 hours, then let sit for the afternoon.  Served with jalapeno cornbread and everyone loved it.

WOW - adding a few extra spices makes all the difference in an awesome chili. I didn't have tomato juice on hand, so I used a can of diced tomatoes. Also did not have a green pepper. Topped it with cheddar cheese and crushed white corn tortilla chips. Other than that, I followed George's directions and had the best chili I've ever made. Thanks!

I halved the recipe and changed the following:  Added more juice, no sauce. I used 3 cans of kidney beans and forgot the green pepper (which was disappointing, I love green pepper). This was pretty tasty.  We didn't add cheese or sour cream.  Just ate with wheat crackers.  This is almost exactly like Flatlander Chili by the same person.

This was a great chili to make on a rainy day!  It cooked up quickly and the flavor was perfect.   We substituted chopped tomatoes for the tomato juice.  We also added garlic and a variety of peppers we had in the fridge.

Used petite diced tomatoes (28 oz) and 2 cans of tomato paste in addition to the tomato juice.  Made it a little thicker and more substantial

I followed the directions, didn't change anything.  It was good but it tasted a little like tomato juice.  I'll make it again though and i'll let it simmer longer, maybe add some garlic.

Great as a meaty chili base. I do have one question though, Where is the GARLIC? I added about 1 TBSP minced garlic and it turned out perfect! Can't wait to try adding corn and other things too!

I would give this chili recipe 6 stars if I could!  I did substitute 2 cans of chili tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce and, like others, I thought that only 2 cans of beans was not enough. So I used 2 cans chili beans and 2 cans of black beans. The spice mixture was perfect.  I recommend letting it simmer all day in a crock pot. Dee-lish!

If I could give 6 stars I would!  WOW that's good chili! I decided to follow the recipe exactly for my first attempt & I'm not changing it!  It's very good as chili, but could also be used as a nacho sauce.  I sprinkled with shredded cheese, added some sour cream & scooped it with corn nacho chips....amazing!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Made it on the stove top, the only changes I made was to used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice because I couldn't find tomato juice and I omitted the chili powder because I didn't have any on hand. My husband LOVED it and he is very hard to please. He is the type of person that is often disappointed with restaurant and take out meals. He gave it five stars and took some to work for lunch so I KNOW he loved it.

This was great!  I didn't add the tomato juice, I just used bottled salsa as someone else sugested, and diced tomatoes.  My fiance loved this because he doesn't like spicy food, but I would add some red pepper next time.  I also served it with tortilla chips, sour cream, and fresh avocado.

This was really good.  I used one large can of crushed tomatoes and one small can of tomato sauce.  I used one large can of chili beans and one small can of pinto beans.  I followed the seasoning exactly except I added about 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder.  It was very good while I was camping.

The mixture of spices smelled wonderfully as it cooked! I am giving it 3 stars as I found it to be too salty. Will try again with half the amount of salt.  I highly recommend Garlic Bread on the side & letting it simmer on the stove uncovered if you want a thicker base.

Agree that this is way too runny and bland.  Lori, chili is not supposed to be runny and watery, if it is then it is not chili.  Con carne just means with meat.

I usually prefer real Texas chili, made with cubed steak instead of ground beef, and no beans.  However when cooking for others I generally make this type.  There are some very good ones out there.  Unfortunately this is not one of them.  It is way too watery, tomato-y and bland. And you should NEVER put regular bell pepper in chili.

I have been making this recipe for months. I add a few things some spices mainly, but this is a very solid chili recipe. As for everyone else liking it that has always been on the very positive side of things as well.

I used low sodium tomato sauce and juice since it tasted a little salty to me the first time. I also added an extra can of kidney beans to make mine more chunky. Fantastic!

Love this chili!  I just made it tonight and made a few alterations.  I used one can of tomato sauce, one can of petite diced tomatoes, and not quite half the bottle of tomato juice.  I also added a touch more sugar than the recipe suggested.  My husband and I both loved this recipe!  We topped ours off with sour cream and some shredded cheese.  Delicious!

Perfection. I added a clove of garlic to my half batch of this recipe and am currently trying it with morningstar crumbles instead of ground beef! I tried a little and it's already tasty. I love my ground beef, but fake hamburger is so much healthier!

This chili is very deceptive, because it looks so easy, and it is. I only leave out the green pepper and add crushed and petite diced tomatos instead of juice to make it richer and boy what a differnece. It is awsome and a stand by for me at least once a month. Also, not too spicy.

This chili is awesome! I've made it several times, and it is usually gone the first night. Everyone who tries it loves it. Super easy and super good.

i hate to review things that i've tweaked. recipes should be judged as written. however there were a few things that either i didn't have on hand or couldn't find in the store (which is a corner bodega for me) instead of tomato juice i used a 28oz of pureed tomatoes- the sauce is plenty thick. i don't have cayenne pepper- but i had a little green hot pepper i threw in instead. i couldn't find pinto beans/didn't want to go the few extra blocks- so i got small white beans. couldn't get a green pepper so i used red. stuck it all in crock pot and so far it tastes great. not because i substituted due to preference, but b/c that's what i could find. i'm even more excited to the exact ingredients next time.

I love this recipe.  Best chili I've ever made. Our stomachs can't take it too spicey, so I leave out the green pepper & the cayene, and this is still a perfect chili.

followed the recipe and it was wonderful. I do not use tomatoe sauce i use a 29 ounce can of whole tomatoes with their juice and a little extra tom sauce .  Easy to make and super delicious with homemade bread on the side. I wouldnt change a thing. I do have to comment that the recipe calls for 1/4 cup of chili powder, i think that is suppose to be 1/4 tsp.

This was great, I used extra tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes with celery and onions instead of tomato juice(I dislike the flavor) and it turned out sooooo good. My husband and kids(6 and 1) loved it. We served it with the Homesteader Cornbread from this site, sour cream and chedar cheese. Just amazing. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty chili and flexible too! I would add more beans and tomatoes next time I make it to add to the health content. Very easy to half the recipe as well.

Love this recipe! I didn't have Cayenne pepper the 1st time I made it, and it was still delicious, so I just don't use it. We also don't really care for onions or green peppers in our chili, so I omitted those too.  It still tastes great though!

Like most other reviewers I found that this was a good base for a chili.  I added my own touches by using bell peppers, crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice and garlic at the beginning.  Made some cornbread to go along side of it and had a wonderful meal.

By George, I've found it.  The best chili out there...Very hearty and just the right amount of spices.  I didn't have tomato juice so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  Came out just perfect....

I made this the other day for the first time and followed the recipe to a T, I did not add or change anything because I wanted to try it first then I figured I would make changes next time if needed. My entire family LOVED it. My husband says it was the best Chili I have ever made. I did use the crock pot and let it cook all day.  I will be making this again, great and easy recipe!

Made this recipe to a T and it was wonderful!  It has a little kick to it which we like.  Also, I only had it simmer for about an hour and that seemed fine.  I will be making this again!  :)

I made this twice already- and loved it! My husband and his grandparents request this all the time!   I just use a big can of kidney beans and if I don't have Tomato Juice on hand I'll use tomato paste with some water.  I like to add some salsa to this to get the green pepper and onion chunks.  Not too spicy but definitely has a nice kick.

Great basic recipe!  Just what I was looking for.  Per other reviews, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice.  I also omitted the cayenne pepper and bell peppers.  I used a can of dark red kidney beans, a can of red beans and a can of pinto beans.

Made it in the slow cooker...  This is the first time I made a chili.  I gave it a 4 because I made a change which did alter the recipe.  To me, the original ingredients of this recipe seems it could be more watery than what we like for chili.  So in place of the 46oz of tomato juice and 29oz of tomato sauce... I used 1-28oz can of tomato puree and 1-28oz can of crushed tomatoes as well as a 15oz can of petite diced tomatoes to have approx the same "fluid" amounts.  I made sure the canned tomatoes were all low in salt or had "no salt added" to reduce the amount of "hidden salt" which is unnecessary.  I also used brown sugar instead.  I left the other ingredients the same.   It turned out AWESOME.  I LOVED it as well as my picky husband.  Although I would add one jalapeno pepper diced, seeded, and veined to give it a bit more kick.  We're using the left overs tonight to make 3-ways... Look forward to it!  Thank you!!!

Very good chili recipe George! Easy to throw together and plenty of room for tweaking if you wanted to, however I did pretty much stick to the recipe as is with the exception of doubling the beans because of the quantity of tomato juice being used. I also added 2 Jalapeno's for a little extra kick. This one is a keeper!

This is absolutely the best chili I've ever had. My daughters and husband agree. I made it in the crock pot and let it cook during the day. Easy to throw together and makes a lot.

Wonderful!  The only thing I did different, was to use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage.  Everyone complimented on this fantastic recipe.  Thank you George!!

We had this chili at a party on one of those subzero nights.  This chili was amazing!   It is not too spicy or hot, but has enough kick to be tasty.

Amazing!  Used a large can of diced tomatoes and their juice as part of the 48 oz. tomato juice.  Added carrots, 1 clove garlic and some red pepper flakes to give it more kick (needed it).  Turned out great!!

I make chili like this all the time. Add some garlic, sometimes corn and Instead of adding tomato juice I just add a bigger can of sauce. Also you cant forget the stewed tomatoes. Hits the spot everytime.

I have done this recipe several times. I follow the recipe with the exception that I add more salt and about a 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of ground white pepper. There is only me and my husband, so we get many meals out of one batch. It freezes beautifully and lasts for weeks. We also like to use it for chili omelets, and it is fantastic served over steamed rice. I do it on the stove top, and I have never had a problem with it coming out runny. This is a great all purpose chili, and you can make adjustments to your liking easily.

A great base chili!! Good as is or make it your own by adding additional ingredients. I followed the instructions exactly and it was wonderful. I served it with shredded cheese, chopped green onions, sour cream and crackers.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it for my family's Christmas Eve Dinner.  I made a few changes.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I pureed a large can of tomatoes, I used a bottle of bloody mary mix instead of the tomato juice, and at the last minute, I saw a large jar of jalapeno peppers in my fridge and thought I'd add a little juice (about 1/2 cup) from that jar.  Everyone agreed it was the best chili they had ever eaten.  I will definitely make this one again.

Fabulous but a little too spicy.  Added Frito's like someone recommended and it was great!  I would recommending cutting back on the 1/4 cup of chili powder.  Making it again tonight and only using 2 large tsp.

Love the recipe, added chili seasoning instead of chili powder.  Added corn and topped with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips like another person recommended.  LOVED it!  Got rave reviews at the party I held, and I made it again the next week for our family.

it was really good, just a little too much tomato taste to it and was a little too runny for us. Next time, I'll use less tomatos juice. Otherwise it was really good.

SOOOOOO GOOD!  I added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to spice it up a little. I also used 2 cans of kidney beans instead of the ones suggested. I also used 1 big jar of canned tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce instead of the suggested. This will be the only chili recipe that I use now

We make this chili a lot in the slow cooker. I use one 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, 1 lb. of ground beef (instead of 2), and 3 cans of beans (1 pinto, 1 black, 1 kidney). Everything else is the same as the recipe. Throw everything in a slow cooker and turn on high for 6 hours. If you live at a lower altitude, you could probably do low for 8 hours. This is closest I have found to an authentic chili taste and consistency.

Made this chili over the weekend for my Husband who is out of commision with a cold, he enjoyed it. He topped each bowl with a sprinkle of mild cheddar and a scoop of fresh onion. Not being a big "bean fan" I have never really enjoyed chili, but I actually ate this one and agreed that it was quite good. I allowed it to slow cook for several hours on the stove.

I heard this was kind of bland...so instead of the tomato juice, we used an empty beans can to add 1 1/2 cans of water and 1/2 can of sriracha hot sauce.  We also added one chopped jalapeno.  Absolutely perfect chili!

This was delicious. I omitted the tomato juice and just added stewed tomatoes(I blended them in the blender because my son hates tomatoes. I added 2 cans of beef broth and some macaroni noodles. I only added 1 tsp of chili powder. And used half a can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. My kids loved it.

This was a great chile. The only change I made was I added extra hamburg and chile powder.

I make this chili every winter!  It's a great recipe.  I add a few extras like a few different kinds of peppers but all in all it makes a great chili without any additions.

Very good recipe. This was my first time making chili. When I was serving the chili it seemed to have too much liquid, however after sitting in the refrigerator overnight it was perfect. After reading other reviews I added the following: Used 2 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef (instead of 2 pounds), 2 cloves garlic, 2 Tbs of Hershey coco powder,added 1/2 tsp. of brown sugar instead of white.

this was very good, and super simple, practically fool proof, very easy to substitute and negotiate available ingredients, im sure i will kick it up a notch next time but this couldn't have better as it was the first time i've ever made chili... side note, all the men in my life, husband, dad and father in law all equally enjoyed it and they are all super picky eaters in their own finicky way.  thanks george!

Excellent.  The only thing I did different was to use stewed tomatoes instead of tomato juice.  It's DELICIOUS!!!

Very good chili - it reminds me a lot of my mother's chili! I think the only change I would make to this is next time I make this recipe I would add celery to the next batch. Besides that I liked it very much.

I thought this was a really great recipe!   I didn't follow it exactly because I slightly misread the recipe when I made my shopping list--I used a 29 oz can of tomato sauce (no juice), and then added a can of sliced tomatoes with green chiles.  I also added more off almost all the spices, especially the cumin and chili powder, and put it in the crockpot.  Turned out really well!  We ate it with some sour cream and cheese on top and with corn muffins.

This is a wonderful base, so I am giving it 5 stars.  I substituted tomato puree for the tomato juice, and then added a small can of tomato sauce.  I also added a can of stewed tomatoes (plus its juice) and a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with chiles (undrained); and used 2 cans of kidney beans since that's all I had.  When it came time to eat, I put some Fritos and cheddar on mine...my husband opted for the cheddar and fresh french bread.  It was REALLY great, and the leftovers will go on nachos and burritos!

A well-deserved 5 stars.

I used V8 instead of tomato juice (only because I had that already), I chili beans instead of the kidney and pintos (again, only because I had the chili beans on hand), I used brown sugar instead of the white and I added 2 teaspoons of cocoa.

Four modifications may seem like a lot of changes, but it really wasn't because two two of those were only for my own convenience, NOT to improve on the original recipe. 

Good recipe George.

This chili was delicious!  Instead of tomato juice I used diced tomatoes and I also reduced all of my spices by half (afraid it would be too hot for my children).  I substituted crushed red pepper for the cayenne pepper because I didn't have any.  I also cooked the chili without the beans and green peppers as I dislike them very much but then added some to my husband's bowl as I served it.  He had no idea the beans and peppers were cooked only a couple minutes versus the many hours the chili cooked.  Topped it with  tortillia chips and cheddar cheese.

This was my first time making chili, and I was so impressed with what little work it was-- just dump it in a pot and let it simmer!  I think next time I'll add more meat and some chopped tomatoes.

Goes great with rice and/or the Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe from this site.

I made this in my crockpot and it came out way to liquidy!  It does have great flavor so if I make this again, I'll do it on the stove top instead and possibly reduce the amount of tomato juice by half.

I thought this chilli was really good but not spicy, I thought chilli powder was more spicy than it actually is, so I will keep the recipe and try to find a way to kick it up a notch next time.  P.S I didn't think it was too runny at all! especially the next day after it solidifies a bit

Excellent!  I doubled this recipe for an Opening Day Football get-together.  There is very little left.  I also had leftover corn in the fridge and added it which was nice.  This couldn't have been easier.  I added kidney beans and black beans and used half ground extra lean turkey and half 93%/7% ground sirloin.  It was delicious and no guilt at all...

This is my go to chili recipe.  I've been using it for some time now.  A few times I've used the Spicy V8 juice instead of regular tomato juice.  I've played with the amount of chili powder I've used.  Added tomatoes, just used kidney beans instead of pintos.  Every time it's wonderful.

its only been in the crockpot an hour and I had to sneak a taste.  SOOOOO good!  I did add a bit of brown sugar and also used the stewed tomatos instead of the juice.  Also added one can tomato paste....Delish!  I cant wait to taste it in the am when I wake up. Making sweet corn bread homemade from this site along with a honey butter! Yum.  THANKS!

First time I scaled a recipe - was a bit nervous that the spice amounts were not correct, but they were. The only change I made was instead of tomato juice, I did crushed tomatoes. I thought it was an easy recipe. I've had better chili, and I've had worse. Will keep the recipe, but still on the hunt to find the perfect one...

I've made this recipe for many people now and always get RAVE reviews.  I've altered it a bit to fit our tastes though.  I use substitute black beans for one of the others (depends on my mood).  Here's my big secret.  Instead of using all beef, I use hot italian sausage links for half the meat.  Cook the links ahead of time until they are black (the char gives the chili a little added flavor).  Ideally, cook them on a grill.  I let them cool, then cut the links into little pieces.  It's more work, but it definitely adds so much to the flavor.

I didn't care for this although my husband (who isn't picky AT ALL) did.  To me it tasted too "tomato juice-y".  Wasn't as thick as I would've liked either.  I'll keep looking, thanks anyway!

Great chili!!! I used ground turkey and like others, used cannced sliced tomatoes rather than the tomato juice. Very hearty and tasty! My hubby and his friend went back for seconds and thirds. A keeper for sure!

I'm not generally a huge chili fan, but this tasted great. And it was easy enough that two of us made four times the recipe amount (to feed ~40 people) in a reasonable amount of time.

Really enjoyed this easy chili! I did half the amount of tomato juice called for, as I read other comments about the chili being a bit too soupy. I also added a whole chopped green pepper. I thought the consistency and flavor were very good. Made it yesterday in the crock pot. After my son had friends over there is only one small serving left today! will add to my recipe box. Thank you, George.

Although this chili was good, it tasted too much like tomotao and not chili.  I would say it was average chili.

I made this for a super bowl party, and everyone loved it. But the recipe on its own was kind of bland. I ended up adding a lot more cumin, oregano and pepper than called for to perk it up. I also used stewed chili tomatoes and diced chili tomatoes in place of most of the tomato juice for a litle added flavor.

This is a very good basic chili.  I like it because women and children will eat it and I can add my own heat (tbsco, chili pwdr, toad sweat. etc) to my liking.  I usually use tomatoes in lieu of the sauce and if doing in crockpot i leave the lid off this allows for simmer and evaporation to make the chili less watery as some have suggested.  Thx George

It was very good!!  I made it in the crock pot and the first night was good.  But I saved some and when I ate it a week and a half later it was that much more amazing.  Letting the flavors work in for longer definitly made it better.  I just had my last bowl today and already want to make it again.  Thanks George.

The first time I made this chili I followed it to a 'T' using the crock pot and loved the smokey taste. And now the second time I forgot the green peppers, onion and ground cumin, because I was in a hurry this morning and didn't print out the recipe. It was a big mistake! I've now printed the recipe and I will follow it! Enjoy!

Even avowed chili haters love this dish.  I skip the green pepper and add some garlic.    If you have a slow cooker, go that route because I hear the flavor is twice as good that way :)

I already have a favorite chili recipe but wanted to try something different so based on its reviews, I tried this one. Looking at the ingredients though, I was skeptical on the outcome but went ahead anyway. I should have heeded my skepticism. Way too much tomato flavor, big lack of spices, needed more beans and was too soupy. Had the right amount of beef but that was about it. Sorry for the pan.......

Great Recipe. Increased the seasonings to suit our taste. Also, changed 2lbs ground beef to 1:1 pork and beef and added 1 24 oz can whole tomatoes which i crushed before adding them.

Made this two days ago for Christmas buffet.  It rocks!  I used all kidney beans, added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and used crushed Italian tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, just because it is what I had on hand.  I cooked it on the stove (too much for my small crockpot), stored it overnight in the fridge and reheated it the next afternoon.  ALL of the leftovers were taken by guests and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  My family already wants me to make more for work lunches during the winter cold.

Thanks for great chili!  :-)

By far the best Chili I have ever made and about a dozen or so others have asked for this recipe. There is something about the combination of these flavors that everyone likes. My chili powder comes from The Spice House and if you use the medium hot chili powder, its makes a big difference. 1/4 C of medium hot chili powder will turn off a lot of casual chili lovers. It will be too much for them. 1/8 regular and 1/8 medium hot is about right, gives it just enough kick.

Very good flavor!  this recipe is a great starting place for chili.  The seasonings are great.  I play with the other ingredients based on what I have on hand and it still always turns out great.  I try to keep the meat/bean weight ratio the same... for example, I might use 1 pound of ground deer meat and then add an extra can of beans for the other pound of meat.  I substitute home canned tomatoes for the tomatoes in the recipe.  I used a can of Ro-tel in place of some of the tomatoes and the chopped pepper one time... still great. I did add a cup of macaroni noodles one time and it was less soupy...more thick like we like chili to be.  I cook mine in the crockpot all day long.  Makes a great supper and leftovers with cornbread!  Wonderful recipe!  My Dh loved it so much he made it at work for the other firemen... with the noodles at which they all squirmed, but he said no one complained and it was all gone with some compliments to go as well.  This will be our chili recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

This was just 'ok'.  The taste was a bit too tomato for my family and it was a little too soupy as well.  Maybe a lot less tomato juice would do the trick.

I had never made chili before, and no one in my family has ever attempted to make it, so they were not a helpful source.     My office was having a fundraiser for the local Salvation Army, and did a chili feed.  I wanted to help out, and came to this website to find a good one.  I tried this out since the name was neat, did everything *exactly* the way the recipe stated (well...except I added a few spices to the ground beef while browning it.), and everyone totally loved it.  I get rave reviews every time I make it now, and I always print off a copy of the recipe, so people can see it really is called 'It's Chili by George!'.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Pretty good. It was not as hot as many of the reviewers led me to believe that it was going to be but that is okay since my kids don't like hot. Not the best chili we're tried off this site but good still.

This is a great chili recipe.  The only thing we do is add a can of black beans as well.  It is so good with cornbread.  Easy to make and not too spicy.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this with my boyfriend last night, and all of his housemates wound up eating it too, drawn into the kitchen by the smell. It definitely an amazing chili recipe. We substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato juice and tomato sauce, as mentioned in other reviews. We also added a couple of handfuls of sliced cremini mushrooms and diced potatoes. Everyone went on and on about how amazing it was. We will definitely be making it again!

great chili!  lots of flavor and easy.  I substituted some chili beans for kidney beans for some added flavor.  Also, I made it in a slow cooker, but it was only in there for about 4 hours but it was plenty of time.  tasted great!

This recipe was outstanding. I made it twice for my husband. It was pretty easy to prepare and make being my first time making chili. Much simpler compared to the other chili recipes on this site. I did add a clove of garlic chopped finely, and celery as well. I added a little more onion that was chopped very fine (with my pampered chef chopper) and you couldn't even taste the pieces despite my husband hating onions! It gave it the perfect flavoring. I also added more ground red pepper to give it a good kick. I used my crockpot on low heat to make it and it only took about 8/9 hours. After about 11 hours on low, it tasted the best! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Awesome - everyone loves my (George's!) homemade chili.
I do mine in a crockpot on low overnight.  I add some chopped celery, corn, and now this chili-lover never buys that canned junk anymore - thanks George!

This chili was great, nice and thick. Since I love tomatoes, I used seasoned diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice and sauce. And I didn't use the cayenne pepper because I didn't want it too spicy.

This is a pretty good chili recipe. A little too spicy, though, for me and my family. Next time I will decrease to only 3 tablespoons of chili powder and omit the cayenne pepper completely. Also, will add some diced tomatoes next time!

I LOVE this recipe.  So easy to change according to peoples' likes.  I have even made this in the summer it is that good.  Perfect for a quick easy dinner for a large or small group.  Great for left- overs.  Share this one with friends!  Thanks George!

Great generic recipe. Allows multiple changes easily. I didnt use tomato sauce or juice, rather chopped tomatoes in their own juices, a little water and about 3 tbsp tomato paste. Already cooked beans really cuts the time. Simmer and Serve. Thanks George!

This is our new chili recipe.  Made this for a day of watching the BEARS and the fiance was impressed (he is usually the chili-maker in the home).  Now the responsibility is mine! :)  At the suggestion of other reviews I replaced the tomato juice with a can of tomatoes but I used the diced tomatoes with chilis.  IMO it could still use just a little more KICK so we added a few dashes of hot sauce to heat it up a little.  Went perfect with a side of corn bread!

The best chili! I'm not much of a meat eater so I used 1 lb. of ground beef rather than 2 lbs. I used my crockpot and it was very fast and easy to prepare.

really good recipe.  Used a combo of chili spices from penzeys.  Also used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and diced tom. instead of juice.  It was great.  Look forward to trying it again. :)

Many, many people have rated this chili as the best they have ever had. Its not especially spicy, but that can easily be facilitated.
I made this for a neighborhood block party, where there were 2 other chilis made and this was by far, the most requested, the most popular and the fastest eaten chili.

For a slight variation, try adding in some pinquito beans in addition to the pinto beans.

Also, this chili is much, much better after it has sat for a day in the fridge. Its worth making and then just letting it sit in the fridge.

This one's a winner!  I made this for the annual chili cookoff at my work and won 2nd place.  I made a few modifications though.  I substituted Rotel for the tomato juice and doubled the amount of kidney and pinto beans (2 cans of each.) It was a little spicy for some older ones but my husband and I think it's perfect!

This chili recipe is no-fail. So simple and so yummy. I made 6 batches for frito pies at my daughter's one year birthday party. It froze well and I was asked for the recipe all night! I used ground turkey for some of the batches...still delicious!

A very good recipe! I got rid of the tomato juice and repaced it with a large can of tomato sauce, this way it came out thicker.  But still a very good recipe! Great taste!

Wonderful!  I omited the bell peppers.  Cooked the onion with the ground beef and popped it all in the crockpot.  Cooked on low all day. The results were wonderful.  My hubby said to stop looking...this is the one!  The spices were right on the mark.

This is a great base recipe.  George has got the basics down pat.  I change it to our tastes a bit (no pintos, all kidneys; basically I cook by smell) but he's got the basic deal.  If you can adapt, this a great, great base recipe.

This gets rave reviews when I serve it.  Only change I make is to add some red, yellow and orange pepper toward the end of cooking to give it some extra color.

Great recipe for chili and will be our keeper from now on.  I mostly followed the receipe as is, but used 3 cans Hunts diced tomatoes in juice in place of the tomato juice and 4 8oz. cans of Hunts tomato sauce instead of 28.  I simmered about 2 hours, but next time I will probably add a half an hour.  Added a 1/2 tsp more cumin too.  Makes enough for a small army!  I froze about 6 meals afterward - what a deal!

This is my go-to chili recipe, perfect for game weekends. I make it exactly as it says, but I admit that I have always added a package of mild flavored chili seasoning such as Chili-O to the mix for an added kick.

I can't believe I've never rated this recipe! This is a hit at my house, and I usually hate chili! This is one of the only recipes that I don't feel the need to tweak. The only thing I did was used ground turkey instead of ground beef for health reasons. For those who have thought this recipe is less than stellar, I challenge you to make it again, sans any doctoring up.  Thanks for an AWESOME recipe. My family will be making this for years and years to come.

Excellent chili!  I used 3 cans of diced tomatos instead of tomato juice.  2 of the cans I blended in the blender since my husband doesn't like tomato chunks.  I followed recipe exactly and it was very good!  Although it does make a lot!  Prepare to have leftovers!  Next time I will half it.

I used this recipe in a Chili Cook-off at work, and it went over well! I went in with a 6 quart crock pot full, and left with just enough for 2 bowls at home. I did make a few adjustments I'd recommend trying. Instead of pinto beans, I used the same amount of Bush's Maple Bacon Baked Beans. I also added 3 chopped vine tomatoes, 1 chopped garlic clove, 1 chopped jalepeño, 3 tbl spoons tobasco sauce, and ¼ cup worcestershire sauce. Tastes best with Cheddar cheese and sour cream to top. :)

I have made this chili about 5 times so far and it is DELICIOUS!  Sometimes I leave out some of the tomato juice if I want it a little thicker for chili, chips, & cheese, sometimes I have substituted some of the tomato juice with petite diced tomatoes, and I always use black beans instead of kidney beans because we don't like them.  Every time it has turned out great!  I freeze it in individual portions instead of buying canned chili.  I LOVE it!

My husband & I really like this chili recipe!!! I make a few substitutes though- instead of the beef, i use a pound of ground turkey & 3 italian turkey sausage links removed from casing & browned w/ the ground turkey. Also took the suggestion of another reviewer & used stewed tomatoes instead of tomato juice. I like to make double & freeze leftovers for a busy worknight!

I was looking for an easy but tasty recipe.  This is it.  My husband, who is not a fan of chili by far was pleasantly surprised.  I did use black beans instead of pinto beans and substituted a can of dice tomato for the the tomato juice.  Anybody who says this recipe is bland is not a cook.  You always season to personal taste. Don't measure pepper, chili powder, cumin, etc...

This is, by far, the best recipe for chili that I have found. You should definately take the time to let it simmer the full 1 1/2 hours, if not 2 hours, as it will thicken up. I only use 1/2 of the tomoato juice and no kidney beans (I use chili beans that I add the last 20 minutes of cooking time), and it turns out perfectly every time. 
This is the only recipe for chili that you will need!

first of all there's a LOT of meat in this recipe compared to the beans!  my husband liked that about the chili but i wanted them more even so i used more beans than the recipe called for and it STILL seemed like there was too much beef!  plus, i think next time i will follow the recipe exactly and add some diced tomatos.  i substitued stewed tomatos instead of the tomato juice, like some people suggested and it turned out too thick. i'd like some sauce with my meat and beans, thank you.

This is a great recipe.  I used only 1 lb of ground beef and I doubled the amount of beans.  I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of juice.

I made this last year and was glad I found the same recipe again. It's so easy to make and play around with - you can add whatever you want and it'll turn out great...but don't forget the shredded cheese on top! Goes great with homemade whole wheat bread or cheese quesadillas!

A great basic and yummy chili.  I used the crock pot and backed off the cayanne pepper just a bit.

This was just ok and very tomato-y even with the tomato juice being omitted.  I agree that everyone has different expectations but I've made a few types of chili and this was probably our least favorite.

Our church has an annual trunk or treat Halloween party at the church. The highlight of the night, other than the children and their costumes,is the chili contest. Each year the winners are the "famed cooking gurus ". You know the ones! Big heavy women who are either raising or have raised a dozen hungery children.They wear the "BADGE" of honor for their success as domestic godesses. I made your chili and won the whole contest. Your chili won first place among over twenty entries. Everyone loved the chili. They were shocked that me, a forty four year old man ,who is not a cook came up with such a winner. I followed the recipie word for word. I bought my ingredient from Wal-mart, mostly their Equate brand

ATTN "Amber".  What were your "minor adjustments"?  Mine were: added 1 small can of sliced mushrooms, 8 oz of beef stock, 1/2 can of beer, small can of corn, simmered longer than suggested 90 minutes.  Served over baked potatoe.

I'm not a huge chili fan, but I thought this was pretty good.  My husband and neighbors gave it two thumbs up as well.  I took advice from other reviewers and used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and also cut down on the amount of cumin due to preference.

Update:  This can be a 5 star chili recipe with a few changes.  The second time that I made this I added 2 cloves crushed garlic, instead of tomato sauce I used a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and added 1 additional can of (black) beans.  These small changes really helped, now it's a favorite!

Previous review: 

This chili was okay, not great.  The chili powder overwhelmed the entire chili and didn't add much "depth" to the flavor.  I cooked it in the slow cooker and it wasn't any better the next day.  It seemed to lack a balance of spices.  Maybe incorporating garlic?

Really really good chili con carne. Not spicy, but not bland either. My hubby said give this one 5 stars. I cooked it stovetop for 3 hours uncovered, except for a splatter screen. Will definitely save this recipe for use again. The only thing I did different from the directions was cook the onion and green pepper in with the meat when I browned it.

Best chili I've ever made! Followed your recipe to a tee, except added less chili powder. I have very hot mexican chili powder and just a few tablespoons gives it quite a kick. 
Thanks, George!

This a keeper! My girl loves this chili. She is not into spicy foods. I don't add the heat till it's on my plate. My pain is, horseradish, raw onions, hot peppers and tabasco sauce.

I'm afraid that I didn't enjoy this. Had to add so much to make it taste like a real hearty chili. Didn't like the tomato juice addition, but I will give this a good basic way to start your chili.

I made this for Peter and he absolutely loved it! I could take or leave a bowl of chili, but never having made chili before, and tasting it when it was done, I have to admit, I was impressed, and had more than a couple bowls. As others suggested I omitted the Tomatoe Juice and replaced it with 2 large cans of diced tomatoes. Good work George, this is a keeper!

It was a chilly day that had me craving chili yesterday.  I had to make a few substitutions because it was all I had in the cupboard - diced tomatoes instead of juice, spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and black beans instead of pinto beans.  Even with those subs, this was fantastic, just what was needed to warm us up on a cool autumn like evening.

This was my first time making chili, and it was so easy. My husband said it was the best chili he ever had. I cut the recipe in half, and it'll be enough for 2 hearty meals. I used 1 can of kidney beans, 24 oz. of tomato sauce, and  14.5 oz of diced tomatoes (no salt added); skipped the green bell peppers and cayenne. I simmered for 1.5 hours in a cast iron dutch oven and served with cornbread.

Good chili! We like sausage in ours so I used a pound and a half of beef and then removed the casing off of 3 or 4 sausages. Then I browned the beef and sausage together and added. Like others, I also subbed two big cans of whole peeled tomatos versus the tomato juice listed. I scaled down the chili spice a little so our two year old son could enjoy also. Very good! Thanks George!

Awesome. My boyfriend said it was the best chili he has ever had. The only things I added were some leftover shreded chicken and some corn. Love it!

This thickened up nicely (I was worried). My husband liked it but wanted more heat. I enjoyed it but thought the left overs separated a bit. I did add 2 cloves of garilc and cooked the garlic, onion and pepper with the meat.

Very very yummy! This was so wonderful and I had plenty left over and even that got eaten! Our leftovers don't usually get eaten but this went! It does take a lot of hamburger but don't decrease the amount, it is wonderful made the way the recipe states.

Awesome! Made a few changes to our taste, but it still turned out great. Did not use the tomato juice, as this was already very wet without it. Note: I also used a less-wet version of this as an alternate filling for the "Southwestern Egg Rolls" from this site, and it was delicious!

Great recipe, very tasty, loved it.  I added no cayenne pepper and used only 1/2 the tomato juice then added canned diced tomato.  Will make again.

We loved this one.  I added three cloves of garlic, one jalepeno, about a half Tbs sugar, and a little more of each of the seasonings.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef.  We'll definitely do this one again.

Finally a chili recipe I can hold on to!  I have been looking for a great chili recipe for a long time, and this is it.  I added corn, squash, zucchini, green pepper, and used spicy tomato juice instead of the regular!  Made it last week and it was gone in two days.  I'm making it again today to freeze in individual servings!!!

I am a chili fanatic!  I am all the time trying new chili recipes.  I'd say this is one of the better ones.  However, next time, I'd add less liquid and maybe more beans as we like a little more heartier of a consistency in our chili.  But, it was good.  I would make it again.

This was great and a big hit at the kids school. I made a double batch and put it into 2 large crockpots for a Teacher Appreciation  Dinner....there was no leftovers! I did add 2 cans of petite tomatoes, a bit more ground beef  AND ALSO used V8. Other than that, I would not change a thing. The consistency was right on...not runny at all....it was a nice thick chili. I made it the night before I needed it (on the stove) and then the day I needed it, I transferred it into the 2 large crockpots and let them simmer on low all day until that night.

Very good, but mine was a little more 'soupy' than I like.  Not a problem, though, I just let it boil off a bit.  Good flavor.
It was great the next day on hot dogs, also!

Quick and easy to prepare. Very tasteful, but a bit thin. Still a very good chili recipe. We enjoyed it. Great with buttered bread to soak up the chili.

I followed this recipe exactly for the most part except only used 3/4 can of the beans for each and added 2 1/2 lbs of ground round beef because we are not huge bean fans.  This is a very good basic chili recipe.   My husband doesn't like it spicy, but I do so this was just right for both of us as it wasn't too spicy nor too bland. I only wish George had told me if I should cover the pot while simmering or leave the lid off.  I left it off cause I wasn't sure.  Other reviews were correct in saying the chili at first looked too thin, but it does thicken up nicely after cooking for the full 90 minutes.  I made it for Superbowl Sunday and it's a keeper!

I made this as a "dry run" before making it for church supper for 60 people.  We loved the flavor.  I, too, added tomatoes.  I think the next time I make this I will back off the chili powder just a bit.  I think it's a little on the spicy side, especially for kids, but I think adults will love it.  Overall it's a great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I added 1 pound of beef to replace beans and used Splenda instead of sugar. Add 8 oz sour cream and my family was in heaven.

Wow, this is a great recipe (although I admit to altering without trying the original).  Spent all day out in the cold, only to come in tonight to a steaming crock pot full of delicious, hot chili.  Quite a treat.

Like others noted here, I used V8 juice instead of tomato, and I held back about 1 1/2 cups and replaced with 14.5 oz. S&W Cajun stewed tomatoes (nice flavors in this brand, including allspice).  I also added 1/2 tsp. cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and replaced 1/2 tsp. of white sugar with 1 tbsp. brown sugar.

Fed it to a group of 7, and there were raves around the table.  Thanks, George.

I followed this recipe exactly, made in a slow cooker, and thought it was terrible. It was very watery, not at all thick and very bland. Will not make again

This is the BEST chili I've ever had. We do like our chili to be thick, so I eliminate the tomato juice. I also only use one pound of meat, which is ground turkey. I've also used all different types of beans in this, and it is always great. Wonderfuul on the stovetop or in the slowcooker. The spices are perfect. We eat this often.

This is a great chili recipe, but definitely has a kick to it, and I left out the cayenne pepper! Also, is 1/4 CUP of chili powder correct? That seemed like a LOT of chili powder to me. I used 1/2 tsp and it was plenty. I also omitted the tomato juice and used 3 cans of tomato sauce and 2 cans of Rotel. I thought it was too "meaty" with 2 lbs of ground beef, so I used 1.2 lbs and that was perfect. Very tasty! Served with shredded cheddar and sour cream, and of course cornbread. YUM!

Very Good! I screwed up and accidentally picked up sauce instead of juice (even though it is clearly underlined) and instead I used whole and stewed tomatoes which I think I preffered anyway. I also used some turkey sausage with ground turkey and it was awesome. Lots of compliments from the family.

This was good but not great. I thought that it was lacking a little something but I am not sure exactly what. I also thought it was a little too liquidy, I like my chili to be a little heartier perhaps I should have reduced the amount of Tomato Juice that it called for. It was good but not great.

Great basic Chili recipe! I did not use any tomato juice, just 2 cans of chopped tomatoes.  We love cumin so I used about 2 tablespoons of it!  Did not use any Cayenne Pepper or Sugar.  But did use 3 different kinds of Chili powder.  Try this:  We made the chili and then made some homemade tortillas, spooned the chili into the tortillas, topped with cheddar, red onion and cilantro and had AMAZING tacos!  Very good George!

Very nice chili! Nothing unexpected...tasted exactly like chili should. Not too spicy, so I added some chopped Jalapanos and it had a nice kick. I also only had clamato juice instead of tomato juice, and it worked out lovely. The chili was a touch runny the day I made it, but by the next day it was very thick. Mmmmm....tacos!!

This was really good! I'm a picky eater and I loved it! I used Ragu pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce, and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice. I also added a bit more sugar, green bell peppers, and onions.  I also used 99% lean ground turkey. Served w/ sour cream, shredded cheese, and diced onions, with corn bread on the side. mmmm yummy!

This was a very easy recipie.
I put everything in the crockpot and cooked it overnite. The aroma the next morning was    wonderful. We like our Chili spicy so I served with hot sauce on the side so that everyone could season to their taste. Also served shredded cheddar on the side too.

Excellent recipe - an all around good chili - just what you would expect, no surprises. I did substitute chopped canned tomatoes for the tomato sauce, and I cooked the onions with the ground beef. My family and friends loved it.

This was really good.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought the green pepper was essential to the flavor of this chili- just dice it finely.  I used the slow cooker and it had a little too much liquid, so next time I'll probably substitute the tomato juice for another can of tomato sauce.  Also I'll saute the onions with the beef- they were crunchy and my hubby didn't care for that.  I didn't have enough chili powder so I used a tablespoon chili powder plus a couple dashes of hot sauce.

My husband and I loved this - a great compliment from him - a relocated Texan.  I did make a few changes.  I scaled it down to 5 servings since it was just the 2 of us.  I omitted the tomato juice and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I kept the full amount of onion and beans, but omitted the green pepper since hubby doesn't like them.  I added some red pepper flakes, and simmered it on the stove for about 3 1/2 hours.  Tasted amazing - perfect for a snowy day.  Thanks George!

This was my first attempt at making chili and my soon-to-be loved it!  He said I can make it anyday and he'd be happy.  I cooked this on the stove (on low for approx. 4 hours). The only changes I made were using 2 cans (15 oz) of diced tomatoes in sauce and 1 can (15 oz) of tomato sauce vs. tomato juice & tomato sauce.  I used 2 cans of kidney beans, no pinto beans.  Left out the green pepper too.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks George!!!

I have never made chili before, and wanted to try a recipe that that I could make using the crock pot. This was great, and ready to eat when we got home from work. Thanks!

This recipe was very easy. I chose the crock pot, made it in the morning and then got on with my day. My family loved it! Not too hot but plenty of zip!

This was great basic chili recipe that will please people who like less "chunky" chilim like we do.  I made it with a little less than 1/2 the chili powder because I was making it for a toddler with a sensitive mouth. Also, I did drain the beans (I used 1 can of kidney and 1 can of Great Northern-the store was out of pintos).  But I saved the liquid from the kidneys and added about a tablespoon of sugar to the liquid and added it to the chili cooked in my slow cooker because I thought it needed a little more sugar. I only added 30oz of tom. juice and 15 oz of tom sauce. Overall, I will make this again and recommend it.

This recipe came out great, but I admit I changed it around a bit.  I used a 32 ounce jar of tomato juice (not the larger can recommended).  I skipped the tomato sauce and instead used one can of stewed tomatoes to have more of a chunky tomato texture.  I skipped the green pepper and cumin (because I didn't have them).  I added one clove of garlic and three heaping tablespoons of jarred "medium" salsa (which gave it a bit more garlic and jalapeno kick).  I also added a can of corn.  I did the stovetop version.  Because of George's great spice recommendations/proportions, it was well blended after an hour and a half of simmering, unlike some stovetop chili recipes I've tried that were too tomato-y if I didn't simmer for hours and hours.  The thickness came just right.  Yum!

this chili is wonderful! even better the next day! i need use some of the suggestions, though. i cut the tomato juice in half. i used a red pepper instead of a green one (they were out at the store) and i added a half a can of green chilis (had some left over ftom the absolute mexican cornbread recipe from this site) but i did add about 2 cloves of garlic, which i cooked with the meat and sauted half the onions with the meat also. then i added a can of tomatoes with jalapenos. it still was not nose running hot but it was on the medium side. my husband said that it was better than my mothers!

I cut the beef in half (hubby doesn't like a lot of meat) and added black beans instead of two cans of kidney beans. My friends, who eat a lot of chili, said, "This is the best chili we've ever had." :D

Yummmm!  This chili was great.  I increased the chili powder to spice it up a little more.  Also, I added an extra can of tomato paste to thicken it a bit.  Served it with the cheddar cheese and sour cream - Excellent! My husband can't wait until I make it again.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I used venison which did give it a different taste.  I also used V8 for the tomato juice to sneak some veggies in.  It tasted great with cheddar cheese and sour cream as garnishes.

MMMM-Good! This is my first batch of chili and I tried it with my somewhat picky daughter in mind.  I too reduced the tomato juice in half and added a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste along with an extra 1/2 pound of hamburg.  I used my crockpot and let it cook the full 10 hours on low.  The spices were just right for just enough kick and we both loved it!!  I made it yesterday and it's almost gone.  You've got to try it to see how good it is.

Very good.  I used about 3/4 of the tomato juice called for, and would probably add another can of beans next time.  But the flavor is excellent, and it's very simple to make.  Just spicy enough.

Love, love, loved it! Followed the recipe to the t except that I only used about half of the required chili pepper afraid it would be too spicy, and I was right - at least for me. Thanks for the great recipe!

This makes me so happy, and I thought I hated chili. I did change some things tho. While the ground beef was doing it's thing, I put a tablespoon of olive oil in the pot and heated the  onion, green pepper, and four cloves of garlic. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice, doubled all of the seasonings, and used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of the white. This recipe is a good base that you can use to tailor it to what you want.

This is a great chilli recipe. I do add more green pepper though, use diced tomatoes, and a tad bit more of cayenne pepper. It's delicious !

I used one can of tomato sauce as it says but then I used a can of crushed tomatoes of the same size, no tomato juice. Used 85% lean organic ground beef. Cooked until browned and drained the excess liquid in the pan before pouring into the pot. I would have added a second green pepper just for more color. Flavors and proportions were balanced!

I have made this for years, it’s the perfect recipe for what my family likes in a chili. Just today I switched the bell pepper for poblano, and it adds a nice kick without being too spicy.

I did make some changes.  I Added 19 oz can each of black beans and white kidney beans.  Added about 2 tsp. Chipotle chili powder and 3 Tbs regular chili powder.  Use canned tomatoes pureed with blender instead of juice and pureed a can of stewed tomatoes. Add 2 chopped canned chipotle peppers in Adobe sauce (pretty smoky and spicy). Used brown sugar instead of white and brown beef and onions first.  I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  I made the day before we had company so the flavours blended together really well.  Served with grated Tex Mex cheese and sour cream.  It had just the right amount of hest for us.  Got lots of compliments.

This is the best chili recipe I’ve ever made! I’ve been making it for years now. Only Adjustments I’ve made are, canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice, a little extra cumin and I use ground turkey instead of beef since it’s healthier! My whole family loves it! And, they don’t even know they are eating turkey instead of beef..

I've made this recipe several times now.  Everyone loves it!  I usually don't have tomato juice on hand, so I end up using diced tomatoes (which I first break down with my immersion blender).  Really, I just use whatever tomato products I have on hand.  Same with beans.  Sometimes different beans, and sometimes I put in extra.  Usually I use a green pepper (and I prefer to put one in), but if I don't have one on hand I skip it.  The recipe is very versatile for using up what's in your pantry!

Excellent. I’ve made this several times and it always turns out great. It handles modifications well. This time, I used 2, 20 oz cans of regular Rotel, 1, 20 oz can of diced tomatoes, and added 1, 15 oz can of black beans and a bag of frozen corn. I left out the V-8 because I didn’t have a big enough pot, but it didn’t need it with the changes I made.

Followed the recipe taking advice of others, used brown sugar instead of white.  doubled the oregano, added garlic and used  Mr. T's Bloody Mary mix bold and spicy.  Did add less than 46 ounces of the Bloody Mary mix, as I did it in a crock pot and didn't want it too watery.  This chili was amazing.  Even got rave reviews from a taster who hates beans.

I didn't have my normal seasoning packets so this was my first  homemade chili! Changes - 2 cans of undrained chili beans, 2 cans of undrained diced tomatoes, 1 15-oz can of tomato sauce, no green peppers (don't like), 2-3 cloves of garlic, 3 T of chili powder. 
browned meat with onions & garlic, drained & added other ingredients. Cooked on stove & then simmered X 1 1/2 hrs. 
Served with spaghetti, cheese, & sour cream. It was a hit!

Excellent recipe however I changed a few items.  I did not use curry,  (we didn't have any), and I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  The one change I would make was adjust  the amount of chili powder. I would decrease it, but it all depends on taste.  Highly recommend.

Skipped the oregano and doubled all the spices except for the chili powder as was recommended by several others.  Used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice.

Everyone went back for seconds and there was nothing left at the end of the night.  Served with garlic bread w cheese.

Excellent recipe. Had to substitute because of what I had on hand. Used 1-540 ml can of stewed tomatoes and 1-680 ml jar of strained tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and juice. Also eliminated the sugar instead used 1 1/2 cup finely machined chopped carrots

I’ve been making this chili for a really long time.  Over the years I have tweaked this and that.. it really is the best base chili I’ve made at home.  

I generally make it with 1 lb of lean ground chicken, 3 bell peppers, 1 whole yellow onion, 2 cans black beans, 2 cans kidney beans (1 light/1 dark), 2 cans of the larger crushed tomatoes (no salt added), and a little bit of water to thin the sauce a little.  All of the spices stay the same as in the original recipe.

I’ve made it with beef, turkey, bacon, with habaneros, jalapeños, ghost peppers.... everyone who has eaten this chili has loved it...  for the past, probably 10 years, I no longer look for another recipe.

This chili was a huge hit in my family’s house! We all loved it. I did not simmer it for the 1 hour & a half & it still turned out great! We ate some corn bread on the side topped it with some cheese I think next time since my family is meat lovers I’d add another pound of hamburger meat! Definitely making it again! Everyone had more than one serving!

I agree with other viewers that if you have to make adjustments to a recipe then it's not the same recipe. I've never made chili before ?? but I've ate it a lot and love it when I go to festivals and church gatherings... So I looked up recipes and this had such good reviews I decided to try it. I read all the reviews and added 1 table Worcestershire sauce (next time I will add 2), 1 tbsp cocoa powder, I lessened the chili powder to 2 tbsp (next time I'll add 3), I browned the onion w a added tbsp of garlic, used brown vs white sugar, and I judged the liquid based on vision. I used the whole can of tomato sauce (next time I will only use half a can), I lessend the tomato juice to 1 cup, and add 1 cup of beef broth so it wouldn't have such a tomato taste. That is 2 cups of liquid vs 46 fl oz (which is a HUGE difference)! I added 1 cup of dry pinto beans that I soaked overnight bc it didn't have many beans for the amount of meat). Basically it was a whole new recipe when I was done w it. I made it in the slow cooker. I can tell you right now if it's made in a slow cooker if you add all that tomato juice it WILL be like soup as a slow cooker tends to not reduce liquids much bc the lid does not allow moisture to evaporate. Did not try it on the stove but I'm sure it would be a little less soupy. This was a good reference for me having never made chili before BUT.... Yeah the original recipe would be too watery and tomatoie. Thanks for the tips everyone!

If you're new to chili, this is the best recipe.   As written, it's solid.   Great base flavors...it's a touch bland for my liking, but I like chili punchy.   Substitute whatever you what....just make sure you're keeping the ratios about the same....Like I use 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound spicy Italian sausage (drained)....I also use 2 cans of the 3 bean combo (pinto, red, and black) and for veggies I use 1 large onion, 1 green bell pepper, 1 red bell pepper, 1 jalapeño, one Serrano.  Go nuts.   

This will also basically fill the medium sized crockpot to the rim...causing splatter if you're not careful.   The last ingredient you want to add is the Tomato juice.

I omit the sugar. After draining the grease from the beef, I add some BBQ sauce and Montreal Steak Seasoning. Other than that, I follow the recipe. I make this regularly for groups and always get great reviews!

I puree my onions and peppers since the kids don't like the chunks, it thickens up the juice nicely. I add just a bit more sugar to help balance the cayenne pepper. I make my own chili powder with out salt so I have to add just a touch more. I add more beans as we like it chunky so I double my spices. We have been making this for years and we always get the best compliments from everyone.

Made as is.  Can't wait to cook it again. It was delish!  I cook for 2 so there were a lot of leftovers. The next day we had baked potatoes with chili and it was even better.

This recipe is great, and I make it all the time! The only change I make is to add a can of drained sweet corn to the pot when I add all of the ingredients. It helps add a little sweetness and cut the acidity a little.

Great basic recipe! Easy to make adaptations to it. I added corn. Didn’t add as much tomato juice because I didn’t want it to be too soupy and didn’t have room in my pot. For my personal preference I would probably add more beans next time.

This is my go to chili recipe! Been making it ever since I found it years ago, just catching up with the times and leaving a review. Made as is the first time and it was great! The only thing I do differently, now,  is add brown sugar instead of white.

I like my chili less soupy so I added more beans, hamburger, onions and green peppers.    I left out the cayenne pepper because I can no longer take that heat.  I gave good portions to my neighbors and they all called to tell me how great that chili was and wanted to know when I was going to make it again.  It's a great recipe.....

My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. She enjoyed no tomatoes while I added a bit more fire. I also changed out the green pepper for yellow. This added to the sweetness. We will certainly make this again but doubling the recipe next time.

This is my all-time favorite chili recipe. I never liked my own chili until I made this one.  I only have 1 variation from the original recipe - I use V8 instead of tomato juice, and love, love, love it. This recipe is simple and easy to make. My whole family enjoys it on a cold winter night.

We love chili but I can't eat spicy and the recipe I have is boring. I didn't have all of the ingredients for this and needed something quick so I altered the recipe quite a bit. I used Spicy V-8, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes in sauce and diced tomatoes as the base, then used the spices as stated and it needed more salt. I served it over chips and cheddar cheese. My husband stopped at three bowls. Definitely a keeper at our house!

Very good base recipe but if followed it would be very soupy chili and my family likes thick chunky chili. I omitted the tomato juice and put two 15oz cans of petite diced tomatoes (not drained) and two small cans (12oz I think) of tomato sauce. Came out perfect.

Soooo good! I did substitute canned roasted diced tomatoes with garlic for the tomato juice. I also added two packages of taco seasoning to the ground beef while cooking. Everything else I kept exactly the same and it’s delicious! I will definitely make it again. I did the recipe In my crockpot for 4 hours on high.

Probably the best chili I've ever had. The tomato juice made all the difference. I put in the whole 60oz or so container instead of 46oz though.

Great recipe.  It had a good balance of flavor.  I made it mixing four different beans: kidney, white, black ,and pinto.  It was served on top of round tortilla chips, with melted cheese, salsa and sour cream.  Everyone loved it!

NO modifications except we like to use 1lb beef and 1lb sausage. This recipes boasts with flavor and is a huge hit. It is a little "soupy" / thin but is so flavorful. Will always use this recipe.

3 as written. Has a really good flavor but the filling ingredients can be doubled or tripled unless you prefer a soup like chili vs a hearty thick chili.  Omit the tomato juice and use a big can of diced tomatoes and a big can of tomato sauce. Add 4 big cans of beans..maybe 5. Not those small 15 ounce cans. Double the onion and bell pepper and 2 pounds of ground beef or turkey and it will be a nice thick chili perfect for the fall and winter season. I have prepared this recipe as stated before and learned that it had to be “beefed” up for my family. After adding extra beans, onions and bell peppers this recipe is a good 4.5 especially served over rice or with cornbread.

This chili was great. I've made several recipes for chili off of Allrecipes, and by far this has been the most successful. It's not too terribly hard either, which makes it perfect for a hearty dinner on a cold day. This one is going in my regular rotation.

I just made this chilli it was easy to make I did use a little more spices than the recipe, I also put Franks Red Hot hot sauce in it, and I used a little brown sugar instead of white. But it’s perfect for someone such as myself who never made chilli before. So thank you George for providing this recipe for us.????

Very good fall comfort food and this is my fav chili recipe that I've tried so far! Only change I made was using cans of diced tomatoes with the juice as opposed to using a can of tomato juice. Easy recipe to double and freeze.

This was pretty darn yummy!!  I followed the recipe for the most part...I sautéed the onion, green pepper and added some minced garlic, then set aside.  I then browned the ground beef.  I started adding those ingredients and everything else to the crockpot.  I used a big can of chopped tomatoes (with the juice included) and a couple cups of water in lieu of the tomato juice.  I also added 1 extra can of pinto beans.  I doubled all the spices except the chili powder, which I added a little extra to taste.  I cooked it on low about 10 hours, it was really good!

This has been my go-to chili recipe for what feels like decades.    Sorry for waiting so long to review!  As-is, this is as phenomenal, but I have evolved it to reflect mine and my family's taste.  First off, I ditch the tomato juice for a bottle of spicy V-8.  That's been my secret chili ingredient for years.  (If you like a thicker chili, whisk in a can or two of plain refried beans into the V-8).  I also swap a poblano for the bell pepper and crushed tomatoes for tomato sauce.  If I'm making this for a crowd, I'll double the beans as well.  I just recommend that you make this recipe as written before you tweak it.  It's as close to perfect as I have found!

I have been using this recipe as a base recipe for 8 years. It is by far my favorite starting point. Don’t be afraid to play with your creation and adjust and add spices to your liking. This recipe is very forgiving. ??

I used a poblano rather then a green pepper and 99% lean ground beef. Pretty good but the texture when you eat it is still "greasy." Ed says that this recipe tastes like what his mom makes.

Delicious!  I doctored it up a little - I added a small can of hot diced chiles and some pepper flakes for a little more spice.

I've always used a seasoning packet until now - this was way, way better!

Delicious! Used 3 lbs of beef, swapped the tomato juice for canned crushed tomatoes, left out the cayenne pepper, and increased sugar to 2 tsp (for a sweeter, chunkier, less spicy chili). Love making a huge pot of this and having easy dinner for multiple days. Reheats great.

This won my church's chili contest!  I wasn't even really trying to win; I was just contributing to the potluck.  There were people who had spent tons of time on their chili's, but this recipe was easy peasy and still got the vote of a panel of judges.

Came out great! Excellent base recipe as mentioned on this review column. Tried it again with "Club House" Tex Mex spices  which is a blend  chili pepper, oregano (dehydrated veggies like jalapeno and bell peppers  etc.) replacing original spices except salt, pepper and cumin. Everyone going to have a personal preference of their own spices.

Very good, will make a gain. I added only half the tomato juice and glad I did because it would have had the consistency of soup.

3.21.18  Seemed like an awful lot of tomato juice, so I did reduce that amount and added a can of diced tomatoes for some additional texture.  This is classic chili, and really hit the spot.

Made Chili by George in the crock pot last night. Just finished off my first bowl. YUM! I followed the recipe exactly but tweaked a bit by adding a can of diced petite tomatoes and a can of "hot" diced jalapenos. Served up with a dollop of sour cream,  shredded monterey jack / cheddar cheese and chopped spring onion. This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing, George!

This recipe is soooooo good and so easy. I follow the recipe as it is, I just add a can of drained petite diced tomatoes. This last time I made it, I was out of paprika so I substituted with some hot sauce. Still came out really good. Its even better the next day as it thickened in the fridge. The people complaining about it being too watery must not realize you can cook out the water by taking the lid off.

This turned out to be the best chili I have ever made.  I took another reviewers suggestion and threw in some leftover salsa.  I also don't like cooked green bell peppers (they make me burp) so I used red bell peppers. Those were the only changes I made. This was even better the next day for leftovers.  Awesome recipe!

Really good chili. I play with the recipe sometime though. I add a lot more spice and brown sugar to sweeten it up. Some people find it really spicy when I make it but they still eat it all because of the flavor. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Very very tasty after changing up the spices! Added a lot more cumin to up that "chili" flavor, a little more oregano, and more salt to taste.

I added a lot more chile powder.  I'm from NM; so we really enjoy hot chili.  While the cayenne tickled the back of my throat; I really enjoyed it more after adding more NM chile to it.  The recipe made a ton of chile; but with fritos; my kids and man made frito pies and now it's only Tuesday.  I see only 2 cups left.  Wow!  This was good.  Thanks George.

I made this recipe. It is an awesome chili. I would go a but spicier so may add more chili powder or peppers next time. I left out the tomato juice as I feel it would have made the chili a bit too thin and was right. It was even thinner than I like with omiting the juice. Overall a great chili recipe though.

A little tomato-ey for my liking but the rest of my family enjoyed it.  

I tried it a second time with a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and I preferred it to the tomato juice.  Didn't seem all that spicy too me, so may add more spices next time.

I made half a batch and used generally the same ingredients as the tomatoes and beans.  Used the spice as directed (half), I thought it was good, but too spicy for the wife.

The recipe wasn't anything special. I found it to be lacking flavor and spices. However, once I made some personal touches it turned out to be pretty good. This recipe was good as a starting point, and then to adjust things for person interest.

This recipe is fantastic!! There’s a little more liquid than you expect from chili but it actually makes it better! I substituted the can of tomato juice with spicy v8 and it is delicious!! You may have to add a little more salt per your taste (because the chili powder and cayenne pepper add heat but there isn’t a lot of salt to bring out the flavor) but overall this chili rocks!

I had some ground beef and meatloaf mix, so grilled some burgers on our charcoal grill & froze them at the end of summer.  Added this instead of regular ground beef and the smokey charcoal added a depth that was unexpectedly pleasant.  Thank you!

I used green pepper sauce instead of green peppers and put in some red peppers. In my book these were small change-outs and didn't make for any noticeable difference to the end result.  The taste was very 'typical' ...what you'd expect for a chili!  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

My husband and I love this easy recipe. I add 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of kidney beans instead. I also add a bit more cayenne and chili powder through out the cooking time. Maybe try adding a Serrano pepper and a jalapeño. It's delicious and has become a staple in my house..

This was my first time making chili and I will never buy the cans of it again. It turned out so well and flavorful. I didn't have cayenne pepper, left out the green pepper, used brown sugar instead of white, and used V-8 in place of the tomato juice. I put it in the crock pot and simmered it all day. Served it over cornbread with shredded cheese, onions, and sour cream.

I love this version. I think the cumin makes the difference. I've used both ground beef and ground turkey. Equally good. I make it in my slow cooker every time.

I was worried to try this because of some reviews of the chili being too bland. I followed the advice of others and replaced the tomato juice with undrained cut tomatoes from a can. Other than that, I followed the recipe as given and I must say it was VERY tasty with a good amount of heat. This recipe is a keeper in my house.

Like a lot of the other reviewers, I found this recipe to be pretty bland.  I almost doubled the chili powder and found it to be a little better.  Also added quite a bit of ancho chili powder and extra cumin.  Definitely set it off.  Not hot at all and not overly spiced.  It's a good start!  Also I made this in a 4qt crock pot and used about half of the tomato juice it called for and about 2/3 of the tomato sauce.  This completely filled my crock pot.  Even without using all of the juice and sauce, it's still a pretty soupy chili.

Awesome chili! Made it heartier with some carrots, onions, and more bell peppers. Also hit it with some Cayenne pepper for that little kick!

Wow.  Best chili I think I've ever had!  I accidently forgot the celery and I didn't have any beans on hand.  But even missing those ingredients this was amazing!  This will be my official go to chili recipe from now on!

I love this recipe I have made it over and over and over again as is. I have finicky eaters who don't like tomatoes so the tomato juice is perfect.  Thank you George.

This recipe is awesome!! The ONLY thing I change is instead of tomato juice, I use 3 cans of diced tomatoes.  I've won a company chili cook-off with this recipe and the family loves it.  Highly recommend!!

It's a great base to start with. It is bland, as some others have stated. I also think it is too thin so I added some tomato puree to thicken it up. I also added lots of cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes. I also added more chili powder. My family loves very spicy chili. I didn't add the pinto beans. My family absolutely loves this chili. My husband will only eat mine. Which makes me feel great. Lol  Thanks for the great start to an amazing meal.

I replaced the veggies with a 16 oz container of salsa, by La Mexicana! it cuts the work in half and its amazing! My inlaws loved it. You can also choose from mild, medium or hot salsa depending on your level of spiciness. Next time, I want to add Jalapenos!


2 pounds lean ground beef (can use turkey)
1 (46 ounce can) tomato juice
1 can kidney beans (drained and rinsed)
1 can pinto beans (drained and rinsed)
1 (16 oz) La Mexicana Salsa (Hot, you can choose from mild, medium or hot)
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1.5 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 cup chili powder

Directions
1)	Place ground beef in large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. DRAIN AND CRUMBLE.
2)	Put ground beef in crockpot. Add tomato juice, kidney beans, pinto beans, salsa, cayenne pepper, oregano, black pepper, salt, cumin, and chili powder.
3)	Mix contents and turn crockpot on low for 8 hours. (turn to high setting if you want it done in 4-5 hours) 
4)	Serve with shredded cheese topping and sour cream. Also goes well with Lime Chips and hot dogs. 

***Note, next time I want to add Jalapeno!

BEST chili recipe we have found. We use 1lb ground beef and 1lb of a tender steak to make it more "meaty". I also use all black beans and add a jalapeño or two (sometimes a habanero) for extra heat!!!

I did like the base of this chili  as you can add whatever to suit your taste buds. I like a mild chili myself but did add a few more spices and bean mixes.  It is simple to make also time and cost effective

This dish was absolutely delicious.  I followed the ingredients and added San Marzano tomatoes instead of the tomato juice.  It was the best chili I ever made and so easy.

I went with this recipe because I have dumb food allergies and needed a true from scratch recipe without using any pre packaged items. This did not disappoint!  However giving it 4 stars because if I had made true to as written, it would have been too soupy for my tastes.  I ended up only using half the suggested amounts for the tomato sauce and chicken broth. Mainly because I ran out of room in my 5qt dutch oven. But that turned out for the best since I like my soups n chillies hearty.  If you're a northern girl like me it doesn't hurt to cut back on the spices either. Still really good and my coworkers loved it.

I changed some things with this recipe to customize it to my household preferences. Omitted green bell peppers, tomato juice, pinto beans and sugar. I used two cans of kidney beans, 14.5 oz of chili ready tomatoes, 2-10 oz. of diced tomatoes with green chilies, honey, 32 oz tomato sauce. Slow cooked for 8 house and every couple hours I tasted it to see if any more spices were needed and ensure the flavoring was on point. New tradition in my household is New Years Eve Chili and this is the recipe to use.

I've made this a few times.  I know there were some complaints about the sauce not having much flavor but I made it the way they said to on here and then added a packet of taco seasoning in addition.  The spices on here are pretty much taco seasoning anyways.  After the taco seasoning was added everyone really enjoyed the chili.

My family loved this chili recipe but I did only put about 2/3 of the tomato juice in (just pour it in until it's soupy enough for you) and 1/2 of the chili powder, because my kids don't like things too spicy. And that was plenty! But this recipe was great. Will continue to use. Thank you!

Very good chili, and easy to make. It was just a tad too thin for me, although the flavor was top-notch. Next time I'll reduce the tomato juice by half, and add some Rotel for a little extra zip.

This is a keeper! After reading the reviews, I made this chili by following Kathleen's review (10/8/2010) and it is delicious!!! I'm going to make it with ground chicken or turkey next time! Thanks to George for sharing and Kathleen, too!

Eyeball the spices and add or subtract as you see fit but I did measure out the chili powder. Added an extra can of beans (either one) didn't use the tomato juice but equal amounts of diced tomatoes in drained. Added a small can of diced jalapeños for the right amount of heat. Used brown sugar instead of white (as suggested). This is thicker this way. I also did the slow cooker method too and didn't drain the ground beef.

This is basically the chili I loved at church potlucks growing up in the South. This is the chili in your Frito chili pie. This will warm your belly on cool fall and winter days. I've made this several times over several years, following the recipe to the letter. Many people have mentioned halving the tomato juice... DON'T! I fill up my pot with all the ingredients, then let it simmer on low, stirring occasionally, until it reduces to a thick, hearty, flavorful chili, over about 2 hours. Don't be worried by the initial watery consistency. If you let the juice reduce, you're left with all that tomato flavor and the perfect chili consistency. And of course, it's even better the next day! Yum!

I used organic sun fired tomatoes, used Tony's seasoning, fresh garlic, garlic powder, chili powder, cumino, olive oil at the base to cook the ground turkey; as I did not use ground beef, oregano, a pinch or two of sugar, and .05 cup of water in the same can is the tomatoes. I layered the flavored by using the same pot, first the meat browned, then onion & peppers, then beans then tomatoes and spices. It was off the chain served over basmati rice cooked in chicken broth.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!!! My boys asked me if I can make it once a week (um no, but so easy that I could).  Only thing I did differently was seasoned the meat, added cayenne and crushed red peppers, and threw it in a slow cooker!!!

This was an excellent recipe.  I used venison meat and instead of the tomato juice, I used V8.  I cooked it on the stove and let it simmer for about 1 hour.  It was great!

This is a great recipe!  I will definitely make this again! 
I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and used canned diced tomatoes in lieu of tomato juice.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I dumped it all into a slow cooker and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  My house smelled delicious and my boyfriend's mouth was watering!

This was very good! I misread the ingredients and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce but it turned out pretty good still. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I prefer a thicker chili and this was a little on the runnier side (despite using diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce). But the flavor was great and my parents who were visiting raved about it. It makes a TON!! Freezes well.

Thank you George for the most excellent recipe. Chili is a personal thing. If you like more spice double the spices not the chili powder though there's plenty!

This is the best Chili ever!!!  My whole family thinks so.  Even my vegetarian loves it; I just don't add the meat to hers and she eats it over rice, a complete protein with the bean, which makes her mother (me) happy.
 I think it must be the tomato juice and the oregano which make this so darn good.

This was my first time making chili and i was a bit worried about how it would turn out. I followed the suggestions to double to spices (except chili pepper and cayenne pepper), substitute 3 tablespoons brown sugar for the white, and substitute diced tomatoes in place of tomato juice. I also accidentally grabbed a can of black beans instead of pinto beans, so that was different as well. But I LOVED the end result. It may not be spicy enough for the more adventurous but for me it was perfect.

Had to make a couple of changes like using low sodium products and no salt for my heart healthy diet and it still ended up being one of the best pots of chili ive ever made!
Thank you so much  for this recipe :)

Love this one, it is now my favorite chili recipe. I did add a little extra chili powder, cayenne and cumin as I like my chili a little hotter but this is an excellent "base" to work from.

Update from original post in 2016:  This is still our go-to chili recipe.  We've tried other recipes and they're just not as tasty (in our opinion) as this one.  Tonight I'll be trying this with venison instead of beef!  

Original post:  My husband actually found this recipe last October (2015) when we were looking for a good chili recipe.  Since then (now March 2016) we've made it four times.  This is a great, hearty soup for those cold winter nights.  We followed the recipe to the T but left off the bell peppers.

I love this recipe! I read the other reviewers who used chunckier tomatos for the sauce (I love thick chili). I had to play around with canned chopped, and diced, Its really all in what your family likes. Once I realized I had no peppers and I love them in the flavor so I used a medium salsa (about a half cup) which added some added great flavors. This is my go-to chili recipe and I think I make it differently each time but the base recipe is perfect!!!!  Thank you for helping me out with this one!!

Fell in love with this recipe right away. This was a fantastic (and easy!) recipe to follow for someone usually all thumbs in the kitchen. Only thing I did differently was substitute the tomato juice for 1 can each of crushed and diced tomatoes because I like my chili a little thicker. I may have been more generous with the ground beef as well. Made this twice already, and aiming for a third this weekend!

This was an easy recipe with just enough spiciness for me. You need to mix it really well for all the spices to work together, otherwise the first few sips will be a bit bland.

Turned out delicious! It made a bunch too! I have a 2.5 quart crockpot since I live alone and it had plenty of extras. Of course I cut down the recipe just enough to fit in my crockpot without TOO many leftovers. Added cheese when eating and it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!!

I have never made chili before and this was quite easy! I did take the advice from others and substitute diced tomatoes for the tomato juice. I also added some tomato past to thicken as a few reviewers did.  I didn't have any white sugar so I used brown sugar and added some diced jalapenos as we like really spicy food. My husband loves chili and said this was his favorite.  I can see where this recipe would be a good base for people who wanted to add different spices, meat, etc. This is a keeper and cant wait to make again.

Easy, great tasting chili. I left out tomato juice but added a can of diced tomatoes. I also added 1 chili pepper in adobo sauce.  The chili came out great in the crockpot. Got lots of compliments and was very happy with the results. It was very moist, but not soupy.

You want chili- this is chili. The taste you have in your head for a chili (not flair) is this. Great, warming, hearty, and  feels like home!

This chili does not need the cayenne pepper.  I cooked the chili in the slow cooker for approximately 10 hours.  It was spicy the night I cooked it and was spicier the next day.  Someone told me that the longer the chili is cooking, the spicier it gets.  Overall, this was the best chili I've tasted and easy to prepare.  However, for those who love spicy chili, then you'll enjoy this one.  Thanks George for a great recipe.  In fact, I've prepared many of your dishes and have totally enjoyed every one of them.

This is the most delicious chili I have ever eaten.  I made it for our New Years' party and the crock-pot was licked clean well before midnight.  It went amazing on Fritos with some shredded cheese.  I have since made this chili two more times and I can't get enough.  It tasted wonderful on baked sweet potatoes and on homemade cornbread.  

Following the recipe exactly all three times....and all three times it was devoured by all ages:  3-85!!!!!

This was my first attempt at making my own chili and it turned out just the way I like it.  I halved the recipe and i don't like a ton of bean in mine so I just did one can of pinto with jalapeños.  I also did not do any tomato juice, instead a can of diced tomatoes.  This made it nice and thick with just a little bit of liquid.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as written, only omitting the bell pepper. It was AMAZING! We've both had colds this week, and having this chili on hand has been a life saver. It's delicious and flavorful, without being too spicy (and I'm kind of a sissy there). It reheats beautifully, too. I even froze some in Ziploc bags, and when thawed out in a bowl of hot water and then zapped in the microwave, it tastes the same as the day I made it!

Instead of tomato juice I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.   Pureed 1 can.  To thicken it I used tomato paste.  Best chili I have found so far.  Will continue to make it.

I personally found this to be a very sweet Chili recipe, and I prefer Chili that is spicy.  I happened to have made the Smokin' Scovilles Turkey Chili, on the same day. I found that recipe to be way too hot for my tastes. So in order to salvage both Chili recipes, I tried the two mixed together. Turned out to be a really tasty, spicy Chili! Since that day, I have made the two recipes again, but modified the directions slightly in order to make it in one large pot. Thank you George for submitting your recipe. It is always interesting to try new ones out, and tweak them to one's own taste.

I used 16oz. of tomato sauce because that's all I had, and I used chili beans instead of pinto beans, and added an extra can. I also cooked the onion and green pepper in with the hamburger. Followed the recipe for seasonings, and it was delicious!

This Chili was very good. As other reviewers, I used canned tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice. Everyone really liked this, we had it for dinner with cornbread one night then again two nights later as chili mac.

I really like this recipe. It is quick to prepare and it tastes really good. I have made it a few times and though I have had to slightly change the recipe each time due to missing a certain ingredient, etc. it has turned out good. The recipe is versatile.

The only thing I would do differently is use canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice to make it a little more hearty. Otherwise, very good.

Original recipe calls for only 1/2 teas white sugar, but I found that increasing the sugar to 1/4 cup removes all harshness. I have made this twice so far and expect to make it regularly as long as I live!  I set out sour cream,  shredded cheddar cheese, sliced scallions and plain tortilla chips or oyster crackers for each individual to add as desired to his/her portion.  Great go-withs are a green salad and some hot cornbread. Enjoy!

This makes a great seasoning blend for chili, but I switch out the tomato products as follows: 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can tomato paste, 1-2 cans petite diced tomatoes (depending on how much I want to make). Serve with macaroni noodles and shredded cheese, and eat with Fritos. Yummy.

I like to try new recipes. I didn't have on hand the tomato juice or tomato sauce so I improvise. I used 48oz of diced tomatoes with juice and tomato soup and added water accordingly. I liked it! Definitely going to try the ingredients listed in this recipe! Making my store list!

This chili was amazing! It got rave reviews from the family, but I did make a few changes. It wasn't quite beanie enough for our family, so I added an extra can of Kidney beans. I also seasoned the meat with a little bit of Lowrey's seasoned salt and garlic.

I give this 4 as-is. It's a 5 with a couple changes. There aren't enough beans in this one for me. I use 2 cans of kidney beans - one can dark and one can light red kidney beans - and instead of pintos I use a can of chili beans (pintos are too mooshy for me). I also have added black beans before. This is a good basic chili, and is even better served on top of Fritos!

I have not tried it yet, but it looks more like soup than chili. It seems to need less tomato sauce. I would sub the sauce with diced tomatoes instead.

Was looking for chili to make in the crock pot and this one used the items I had on hand....more or less. Nice combination of spices with just enough kick and the family liked it so it's in my favorite folder. Thanks George!

A great base recipe. My family likes a chunky chili so I replaced the tomatoe juice with the same amount of diced tomatoes (juice included).

ive tried several different recipes for chili and they either turned out bland, to hot or not hot enough. my wife always lets me know if somethings wrong with it. i tried this recipe and she loved it. the only thing i changed about it was that i only pit 1/8 cup chili powder instead of 1/4. it was just right and my wife all that was in her bowl. great recipe!

Good basic chili. Like many others, I substituted: 1 28oz can crushed tomatoes, 1 15oz can fired roasted tomatoes w/garlic, 1 15oz can diced tomatoes w/green chilies, and 1 10oz can Ro Tel tomatoes for the tomato juice and sauce. I added 3 garlic cloves crushed. Used all seasonings as in recipe but used brown sugar and added good dash of cinnamon sugar and a heaping TBS of homemade taco seasoning from this website and good dash of crushed red pepper. My 4 rating is based on the original recipe. I'll give mine a 5.

There was too much liquid and lose of flavor just using tomato juice.   I'll probably go back to my old mix it together until it seems right.

This recipe is fantastic. It makes enough for big gatherings or plenty for a family dinner and leftovers the next day. All 3 of my kids (5, 2 and 1) love this meal. I will usually adjust a recipe if I feel like one ingredient has too much, too little, etc but I always make this reciepe as is except for the ground beef, we only use 1lb which seems to be plenty. I thought the chili powder would be too strong at first but it's a perfect amount. I will only let the chili simmer for about 30-45 mins so I can't imagine how tasty it would be after being in the slow cooker all day. Best chili recipe out there!

Very yummy and easy to make.  My family likes it very spicy so I added a couple of splashes of insanity sauce to it.  There was just enough leftover for me to take to work the next day for lunch.  As with all chili it was even better the next day!  Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  I used half the tomato juice and sauce as others recommended and added 3 cloves of chopped garlic. Definitely will make again using less chili powder considering I cut the liquid in half.  Still good even spicy!

This was a very good base recipe. Since I do not like soupy chili, I used a small can of juice instead of a 48 oz one.  I used one can of diced and one can of stewed tomatoes and left all seasonings as written. It was very good.

I'm 24 and this is my first chili recipe I made as an adult. I loved that it could be made in crock pot. The only thing I did different was use 2 (14.5oz) cans of diced tomatoes undrained instead of tomatoe juice. Also I used reduce sodium tomatoes and sauce. Next time I will add minced garlic. My skinny minnie fiance devoured 3 bowls last night! We loved this recipe!!

Delish! Thought not enough veg. Added corn, which was nice. My pot was almost overflowing - beware! I also halved the recommended chilli powder and added a jalapeño. Great to freeze for dinners.

This was a pretty yummy chili and an easy recipe to follow. I cooked the ground beef and cut up the onion and green pepper the night before. I put everything in the crock pot before I went to work in the morning, and it was ready for me and my roommates when we all got home. 

It was my first time making chili, so I think this was pretty good. It could definitely be spiced up depending on your preferences, though. I added a little cheddar cheese and cream cheese to the top of my bowl.

It was delicious! I also made a few changes: 3 tablespoons brown sugar, double spices (except chili powder). Ladled it on spiral mac, then sprinkled with raw onions & shredded cheese. Served with cornbread muffins. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This has amazing taste.Try using the tomato juice per the recipe.It adds a great flavor. Also,if you want it thicker add some masa harina,1 or 2 tablespoons. I also added 2 teaspoons of grated garlic! Great recipe!
Made this again and used V8 because all of the tomato juice was clamato :(   1 15 oz can of rotel tomatoes and 1 15 oz can tomato sauce. Great recipe!

I love you, George. I added black beans and have used turkey and beef.  The turkey was better.  Also, like others, I use canned diced tomatoes in their juices in place of the tomato juice.

I made some changes but my family LOVES this recipe. I omit the cumin and add stew meat that I brown before putting it in. I also add double the Kidney beans and pinto beans and also 1 can of black beans. I put two bell peppers and a whole onion and a lot more chili powder. My kids don't like any spice so I either omit the cayenne or put in a tiny tiny bit and then add some to my bowl separately. House smells great and it's a terrific dinner when all our schedules have us eating at different times. Hubby makes a terrific honey cornbread to go with it. Yum. Thanks for the starter recipe - made some changes that customized it to my fam.

As other have said this is a great base recipe of you're looking to experiment and make it your own. I cut the tomato juice by 1/4-1/3ish. Added one fresh jalapeño, extra cumin, brown sugar vs white and a large dollop of mixed garlic. Still, it tasted a bit too tomato-y so I added about half a serving of beef bullion straight to the mix and it really helped nip that in the bud. Tasted much heartier. Next time I think I will experiment with adding chocolate!

Really, really easy recipe.  I can't say that I measured everything out, but did use all the ingredients at approximately the prescribed amounts.  (Only used 1 pound ground beef, though.)  REALLY fantastic result.

I put up a review last week saying I did not hangs the recipe other than using venison. It was perfect. I then made a 2nd batch this time using V8 vegetable juice "organic" 100% juice in place of the tomato juice. It definitely smells different. But the taste is NOT compromised at all. Still very good.

Great recipe. I use a can of tomato paste and a quart of water in place of the tomato juice though. I also use 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb italian or chorizo sausage sometimes. I make this chili on a regular basis

Great recipe...I made a couple changes first I used ground bison instead of beef and I mixed 1t of onion powder and garlic powder with the meat while it cooked. I swapped the tomato juice for diced tomatoes so you get a little bulk withthe juice, used kosher salt instead of table salt and brown sugar instead of white. I also cooked it in the slow cooker all day whIle at work...yummy yummy and will make again for sure!!

Basically used this recipe in a slow cooker for 6 1/2 hours. But we are garlic people so of course that was a tastey addition. Used only 1lbs of ground chuck. Substituted the other pound for macaroni. My kiddos love the noodles. Added 1 can of fire roasted tomato chunks.  Used vegetable juice instead of straight tomatoe juice for the extra health benefits. Used Italian seasoning instead of plain oregano. Added a bit more chili powder. Instead of salt and pepper I also used hamburger seasoning which contains both anyway. Used a bit more cayan than it called for and left out the onion. But all in all a tastey recipe my family definitely loved. Served with homemade cornbread great dinner for a chilly fall evening!! So thanks George!! Double thumbs up!!

Good basic chili recipe.  The only modification I made was to use a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce and omit the cayenne (so my toddler would eat it).  It makes a ton so I will be enjoying it for lunch this week.

This recipe was delicious!  Very easy to make and was spicy and sweet all at the same time.   I followed others recommendations and used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and think that gave it the sweetness.   I served to very picky chili lovers and all of them asked for my recipe.   Will definitely make again, but may use less juice and add tomatoes to make it a little more hearty vs. soupy.

made this the other night, with a few changes due to lack of ingredients on hand.  Omitted the tomato juice and sub 2 diced fresh tomatoes. Also subbed chili powered for hot sauce (franks red hot) used amount called for.  Didn't have the time to slow cook it, and it came out amazing! definite keeper!

Great flavor the every one liked.  I prefer it a bit more spicy so I made a 2nd batch adding 3 blended habanero peppers to the pot...and it was hit at our Halloween gathering.

Nothing spectacular and maybe because I altered the recipe based on other reviews. I omitted the tomato juice and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 can tomato sauce instead. I also substituted a pound of beef for a pound of sausage,added garlic,green chili and used less chili powder. It's a great base though.

Made this for a tailgate party, bunch of guy's watching football by an outdoor fire pit. I heeded other's input about not using the tomato juice since I wanted it pretty hearty and not to runny. I used 1 15.5oz can of diced tomato and 1 15.5oz can of stewed tomato instead of 46oz of the juice. 
I had the tomato sauce available but left it out also since as it came together, I was pretty happy with how it looked. Glad I did! The slow cooker method for 8+ hours did wonders bringing this to just the consistency I was looking for even if a little light on tomato. 
Overall it was a very big hit. I did add double the cumin, cayenne and green bell pepper but that's just personal taste and no fault of a recipe that did a good job of giving me, a non cook,a platform to work from.

I made this chili last night for the first time and thought it was very good. I followed some of the other reviews and used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. I also played around with spices and ended up adding about double of everything except the chili powder which I only added a little extra. I doubled the green pepper too just because I didn't want any left over but I don't think it made much of a difference. I served with elbow macaroni, cheddar cheese, and Fritos. We will be keeping this recipe in the fall/winter rotation!

This was the bomb.com!  (-:  Maybe it was the V8, but this was so delicious.  My husband and young children all had second helpings, and so did I.  I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic, a fresh chopped tomato, and used liquid cayenne pepper sauce instead of powdered.  My Jalepeno cornbread was too spicy but otherwise a nice complement to a great one pot meal.

The only thing I changed from the recipe was, I added about 1 cup of red bell peppers, I used a 32oz box of tomato soup (instead of the 46oz tomato juice), and i added 2 bouillon cubes. This chili was amazing! It reminded me of the Wendy's chili before they changed their recipe (if they didnt change it then maybe i got a bad batch last time i went) The next time I make these I will omit the beef and add 2 more cans of kidney beans and 1 more can of pinto beans. (Tip: if u dont want the beans to be over cooked and mushy then wait until the chili is done, add the beans and boil it for about 15 mins.)

Good, as most people have said, basic chili recipe. Needs some extras to satisfy my taste. Added a can of petite diced tomatoes and some freeze dried pinto beans with spices found at our local Winco. After that tasted great!

For those who think this chili has too much liquid, try adding a can of mashed black beans or a can of refried beans to thicken.
Might even use some corn flour or mesa to it.  I prefer the mashed beans.

This chili was okay, but could not be my favorite! I made it in my slow cooker. It was quite runny (though it thickened up after a couple of days), and the flavor was nothing spectacular. I will keep searching for another chili that I love.

I use this recipe every time I make chili. I do not add any additional ingredients, just extra cayenne. I love this recipe. I keep tasting it while it cooks. Like most things, it tastes even better the next day. I am really glad I found this recipe. Thank you "George"

I've been using this chili recipe for a couple of years now, and it's great! I usually add a can of black or navy beans to it and sometimes some hot sauce, tomato chunks, garlic.... It always comes out great! I like to put it over macaroni noodles with some cheddar cheese on top, too. Yum! It's very cost efficient and you can make it go far! I froze a couple bags of it for when I got home with my second baby as well, and that worked out beautifully! My husband sometimes tries to convince me that we could eat only chili all the time. ;)

The best chili in the world!  It taste just like Wendy's chili.  This recipe made a lot.  I followed the recipe but added some whole grain elbow macaroni.  I had a big pot full so I freeze half of it.  No issues unthawing it and the flavor was there as it was first cooked.  I didn't use a crock pot.  Print and Save in your personal cookbook.

This was the "best" chili recipe.  My husband went back for seconds.:)I didn't have Pinto beans so I used a 29oz. can of Kidney beans.I also did not have tomato sauce but did not need it. Used all the spices as in the recipe and it was terrific.

This was a hit in our house.  My only mistake was making 6 servings instead of 10! I followed the spicing exactly but added the following 1 TB yellow mustard, 1 teas worcheshire sauce, 1/2 teas garlic powder.
I also subbed crushed tomatoes for the tomato sauce as we like a thicker chili.  This one is a keeper.

I am not what you would call skilled in the kitchen.  My husband is the cook in the family, but I've been trying to step it up and do my part lately.  I've tried this a few times and it has been a hit with my 2 year old, 5 year old and outspoken husband.  :)  It's great for the kids, as it's not spicy, hubby can add his spice to it on the plate, everyone is happy.  This is one that will stay in my folder for life.

I made this chili and my husband raved about it!  I made a few changes...I realized that I only had a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and no tomato juice so I used a suggestion from another reviewer and added bloody mary mix about the size of the tomato sauce can.  I also added a can of tomatoes chili style and sauteed the ground beef with onions and garlic first.  Have definitely saved this to my recipe box!  Thanks George!!

Awesome chili! Great flavor, nice texture and very simple. My teenage sons LOVED it! I adjusted to make with 3 lbs ground beef. I followed most of this recipe to a T. I added a little color with switching up the beans with 1 can light, dark kidney beans, 1 can northern, 1 can black beans.. I also used what I had in house and used diced with juice instead of tomato juice. I also make it into chili mac with cooking elbow noodles and keep them both in separate crockpots for a self serve saturday. A little cheese or sour cream and it's a meal!  
This is a keeper in our home.

Delicious!  I've tried other, more extravagant, chili recipes with no success.  The more simple the recipe the better, in my experience.  My kids love it.  I add extra ground beef and extra beans because I like my chili thicker and a litte more spice as well.

Topped with raw jalapenos, shredded sharp cheddar, fritos and sour cream - LOVE it.

Gtrat recipe! Usually change a few things in recipes...to this one I subtituted crushed tomatoes for the tomato juice and the sauce.I first browned the onion, and added some needed crushed garlic. Then threw in the chopped pepper for a minute or two. I mixed the ground beef with the sesoning (leaving out the caynne) and browned that. Then mixed all with the cushed tomato. Simmer for two hours, adding the drained beans beans the last hour. Served with corn bread...yum!

Loved this chili!  This was a big hit with the family.  Very hearty and tasty. The only changes I made was I cut down on the chili powder to 2 tablespoons and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice.  I already have people asking me for the recipe.  Will definitely make this again!

Made as is, except I didn't have enough tomato juice (only had six 5.5-ounce cans instead of one 46-ounce can). Came out very good - rich, hearty, super filling. Thought it would have more of a kick, but that can easily be adjusted next time with more chili powder, etc.

I love this chili!  Just the right amount of seasoning to give it a little kick.  I use two cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce...mainly because I love tomatoes.  Just delicious.  Thanks George!

I have this simmering in the crock pot now for Superbowl Sunday. I only made a couple of changes just because I like my chili thick and spicy. I omitted the tomato juice and added two reg cans of diced tomatoes. I added a half pound of spicy Italian sausage, two tsp. diced garlic, an extra tbs. chili powder, and tripled the cayenne. This already tastes amazing and I know everyone will love it. Thanks so much!

It's a good base to start with, I add more spices and a lot more green peppers. If I have left over yellow and red peppers then I add them. I also add a can of chopped tomatoes. Thanks for sharing George!

Wow was this good!  I did not add 1/4 cup of chili powder, partially because i was out but also becuase it would have made it too spicy.  I probably would have only added 2 T.   Other than that, to a T.

This is a savory, delicious yet simple chili recipe.  My boyfriend is from Texas and takes his chili very seriously.  He absolutely loved it.  Since I went the stove top route, I used less tomato juice (about a quarter less).  I will make this again and again.

This chili is so delicious. I like things a little less spicy, and this one is perfect for me - but I also make a spicier version for my boyfriend. I usually make a huge batch in the crockpot and then fill sandwich bags full and freeze them. They are so easy to heat up after a long day of work! 

This chili is also very easy to modify if you have fresh veggies you want to use up or want to play around with bean types.

This is must-have in your repertoire. George has this same chili recipe posted elsewhere on Allrecipes and a few thousand people have rated and reviewed his recipes. Very reliable.  Remember to try popular variants such as chili-mac (or chili spaghetti) and chili size (a knife-and-fork version of a chili-burger).

This is an easy base recipie to make and if you want more flavor, you just add it via more veg, beans or spices! My husband absolutely loves it every time. It's also a great recipe to make in bulk for freezing make a large pot of it and scoop the left overs into tupperware dishes and place them in the freezer for future lunches and dinners.

This was fantastic! Had to try this with all the reviews and used some of the other reviewers tips...used brown sugar instead of white and cut the tomato sauce in half and added a diced toms with their juice so there would be some toms in it. I doubled this and used crock pot (2 actually) for this recipe for my daughter's party and we had many folks going back for seconds and thirds! We have tried many chili recipes and this one now will be our go to. To me, it was not spicy, which was good for our purpose, but this recipe could easily be tweaked with more cayenne for more spice. Bravo on this one, George!

I'll give this recipe 4 stars since I did change quite a bit of it. I used turkey instead of beef (No one could tell the difference or even mentioned it) and instead of using all those spices I cheated and grabbed a two packets of a mix. I did add more chili powder, cayenne pepper and cumin to the pot because my family likes it spicy. I slow cooked it for 10 hours and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this again

I prefer something a bit spicier so I added spicy v8 in place of tomato juice. The chili turned out great. I will certainly make it again. Thanks!

I made this chili last night for Halloween.  I was in such a big hurry for Halloween party I literally put all the ingredients in the slow cooker and stirred a few times through out the day.  When company started to eat the chili, I could not get over how many people LOVED it!  I'm glad I found it and would not change a thing.  Some people put it over tortilla chips, next time I will buy a bag of fritos....But other than that, I would not change a thing!  Great recipe!

This recipe is amazing. I don't really like whole, or even chopped, diced or crushed tomatoes. So, the tomato juice is great for the taste. the only thing different that i do is double the Cheyenne pepper, to add a little more kick, and add a couple of whole chipolte peppers to get a deeper taste. I cook this chili at least once every year, and everyone always loves it.

I made the chili this weekend and it was outstanding! We loved it and it was so tasty - not overpowering with beans or meat - just the right consistency.  My thanks to George.

I made this chilli yesterday for the first time. Put it in my crock pot and simmered on low for 8 hrs. The only change I made was adding some frozen corn to it. My husband and I both really enjoyed it! Keep in mind this chilli is not the thick and chunky type. It's not very spicy either. I like it this way myself. I will make this again. Thanks so much!

Made this chili last night and it was a HIT!  In fact, the kids are having it for breakfast this morning!  LOL  Since my brood loves spicey food, I think I'll put a can of Rotelle tomatoes in the mix next time!

This is the best chili recipe I have tried! I made it in a slow cooker and then let it sit overnight, because that is always the best option in my opinion. We only used one pound of ground turkey, because we don't eat that much meat. We thought it was perfect!

I make this chili at least 2-3 times a month in the winter. My family just can't get enough of it! I add jalapeños and a little extra cayenne pepper to give it extra kick!

This is a really really great base for chili! I took some other reviews advice and halfed the V8. The only other change i made was put in WAY more spices. I added onion and garlic powder and honestly i think i probably tripled all the spices except the chili powder but i did put in more than a 1/4 cup. I just kept on tasting it until the flavor was right for me. So be brave if you like it hot make it hot, season to taste but this is a wonderful starting point. Thanks George!

Wonderful recipe. I halved it because it was only my husband and I but it still made plenty for us and plenty for leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly but added 2 chipotle peppers only because i had them in the fridge. Soooo good!

A very good basic chili, I did make some changes like others, 2 cans of ground peeled tom, white kidney beans, 2 tsp sauce from chipotles in adobo - gave it a bit of smoky flavor and spice, eliminated the cayenne and tom sauce and juice, instead added 3/4 can beer, can diced tom in sauce and added 4 cloves garlic. I browned the meat with the onions, then added the remaining ingred. Will def. make this again, my kids can't wait to eat!

Delicious! I do not like spicy foods, but somehow I ate my whole bowl of this chili even though it was way too hot for me. My husband who is less of a wuss lol said it was the perfect amount of heat. I was kind of lacking in the grocery department so I did have to make a few minor substitutions. I didn't have any green peppers so I just left it out. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato paste because I didn't have any sauce. I used 1 can each of red & white kidney beans and 1 can of white navy beans because that's what I had. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and I will definitely make it again!

I made this this weekend and it was EXCELLENT!!  My husband has requested that I make it again this week.  :)  I followed the recipe except no green peppers and 2 cans of pinto beans (no kidney beans, not a big fan)  I think I will add some chopped tomatoes next time but it was a big hit!!  Definitely will be making this again very soon.

Real simple recipe, just what I like.  I timed the recipe by 5 which fit perfectly in a 20qt pot.  I plan to freeze the large batch into small quanities for quick meals throughout the winter.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My first time making chili, I wanted to find a recipe that would be simple but good. As soon as I mixed everything in the pot, I knew it was a good recipe because the smell just spelled "chili". I haven't tried making a lot of changes to it yet, in the future I will experiment. I cut the recipe in half because it was a trial portion, and this time I just added more cayenne (x3, I like spicy!), about a tablespoon of agave syrup (in addition to cane sugar instead of white sugar), and a few splashes of chipotle tabasco sauce. Also, some raw cocoa powder (about 2 tbsp) - I heard this does wonders for subtly enhancing the taste. I only used kidney beans because I prefer them to pinto. Next time I might try diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because I do like thicker/chunky chili, plus fresh tomatoes might add an extra zing to it. I also browned the onions for about a minute before throwing the rest of the stuff in, I think it works well. The recipe worked great though, thank you!

This recipe, with 3 small additions from the suggestions of other reviewers, is the best chili I've ever made yet!  I love tomatoes, so I added 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Also love garlic so I added 1 tsp garlic.  And added 1/4 tsp unsweetened cocoa.  This was all for a recipe whose porportions I cut in half.  I will be keeping this one!

Wonderful flavor! I did add 1 can of Hunts Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes (with garlic). I also before adding the onion and green pepper in to the pot, threw them in a pan and sauted them in a tablespoon of butter along with a tablespoon of garlic. Topped with cheese and chives! Delicious! :)

I made this recipe for a big crowd to kick off the Fall season.  It was definitely a crowd pleaser.  after reading several reviews, i also modified the tomato juice to chunk rotel (two cans) and stewed tomatoes (two 15oz cans), and it was perfect.  Next time I will add another can of kidney beans, because I prefer my chili with a lot of beans and tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing George.  This recipe is a keeper!

Best chili I've ever had. I use black beans and kidney beans and usually double or triple the recipe.

This chili was really yummy. I only made half a batch and it was great. I added a large clove of minced garlic and sauteed all the veggies with the meat to bring out the flavors.  This was so far the best chili I've made.  My boyfriend ate 3 bowls.

Fantastic chili!  Browned the beef with four cloves of garlic, omitted the green peppers, and added two diced jalapenos and a small jar of salsa.  Instead of the tomato juice, I added half a (46oz)jug of Spicy Hot V8.  My husband thought it had a bit too much liquid, so next time I might just buy the cans of Spicy V8 and start with just one of those and go from there...

Very good basic recipe. Not too salty like the ones at the restaurant. I made some changes, I did not use tomato juice and instead i used tomato sauce and a can of tomato(mexican mix)for it. I added 2 T of cumin and my boyfriend said to add more.   Also I used a thermal cooker for this. I put it in the thermal for roughly 3 hours. When cooking the beef use oil for the pan or else it will stick and burn! I learned the hard way!

This is by far the best chili recipe I've ever found.  I made it exactly as listed and will certainly be making again (and again).  My family loved it.  I've tried many chili recipes before and everyone agrees that this is the best.

This was the base for a good chili I think, in my opinion it was WAY TO MUCH Chili powder! All I could taste was chili powder and I even put it in a little less then it called for. If you like the taste of strong Chili powder this recipe is for you, however I do not. Next time I may just put in a tsp or 2. It was good besides that.

A pretty good basic chili. It was a bit too soupy so I used 1/2 the tomato juice and added tomato paste to thicken. I also added more seasoning to kick up the flavor.

Yummy! I did what other people said though: I used canned diced tomatoes with the juice instead of the tomato juice itself. Also I like more flavor and added garlic, s & p, etc.

Love this chili recipe and I have made it time and time again.  I put it in the slow cooker, and let it cook all day.  The only thing I recommend for those who like to use a slow cooker is to slightly decrease the amount of tomato juice.  Otherwise, absolutely perfect!

I really liked this chili! I cooked the ground beef the night before and the next morning I put all ingredients in the crock pot on low for 8-10 hours. I made it without the peppers and onion (my husband won't eat them) and it still came out great. I also sub. tomato juice for diced tomato and doubled the pinto beans. Not too thick or thin.

I didn't alter a thing in this recipe and thought it was absolutely delicious. The spices were not overwhelming, which meant that my spice-adverse children loved it, while there was enough spice in it to please my husband and me.  I "stretched" the number of servings by making the portions a bit smaller and serving them over rice.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

A very good recipe - I did, however, use 3 lbs of beef and 1 more can of chili beans. AND, next time, I'll add more cayenne to spice it up a today. I like mine a little hotter.

I am not sure what this is missing but the tomato juice seemed to overpower this recipe. I may make again but I will read the other reviews first and see what changes they suggest.

It was a little salty, but other than that it was really good! I added some mushrooms and put half the tomato juice in it. It might have been the tomato juice/sauce that made it salty so next time I will add less salt.  Super yummy and really easy to make!! Lots of leftovers to put in freezer too!

A very pleasant straight forward chili.  Used honey instead of sugar and enjoyed it with salad.

Amazing recipe. You can make your own changes to the recipe and it'll still come out great. I added diced carrots,  used only 2 cans of diced tomato with an extra diced roma tomato and although a bit chuncky (which is how I like it), it still had enough juiciness to it. I also used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground beef and the taste is amazing.

My husband and I love this dish! I usually cut down on the chili powder because I can't handle spicy, but when I put it all in the hubby appreciates it. I do usually add some celery just for extra veggies and leave out the cayenne pepper since I never seem to have it on hand. Just took it to a church function and everyone loved it too. Love that it can be done on the stove (super quick) or the slow cooker. Thanks George!

EXCELLENT recipe George!! I made a big batch of this chili for a work charity function/contest and the line up just wouldn't end for this chili! It's thick and hearty and looks exactly how a chili should look.  The only change i made was adding a little bit of chocolate to heighten and deepen the flavours.  Tastes even better the day afterwards!!

Too hot.  Be aware that the chili powder in the US may differ from other countries.  I made this and it was inedible, even after I diluted it.  Waaay too hot.

I made this for a party yesterday, and got compliments on it from everybody!  I only had 3 tbsp of chili powder, and I was worried that it would be too bland, so I added about half a teaspoon of hot pepper sauce.  I also had read that it was a bit watery when it was cooked in the slow cooker, so I used 28 oz crushed tomatoes and 44 oz tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice and tomato sauce called for by the recipe.  It was still a bit watery when I turned it off after about 8.5 hours of cooking, but I let it cool for about half an hour before serving, which let it thicken up some.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, also a great base to add to taste!  Second time around I didn't use tomato sauce, added red bell pepper and corn, and used four different kinds of beans instead of two.  Also, a little more of each spice to account for the extra beans. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this and it was great.  I used two cans of tomato paste and two cans diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice.  I only used 1/2 a green pepper since I don't love green pepper but wanted to keep some of the flavor.  I used 1 tsp jarred garlic and 1/2 the chili powder it called for.  My family loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I took the advice of some others and substituted canned tomatoes for the tomato juice.  I also bought a variety of fresh hot peppers, grinded them and added them and some of their seeds to the chili.  FABULOUS!

We love this and it's very easy.  I prefer chopped tomatoes (29 oz.) in their juice and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce to all that liquid though, but the seasonings are perfect!

Excellent as a base chili but I did change it up. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chillies, 99% lean ground turkey, one can of tomato paste and just a little bit of water to thin it up it came out excellent.

This was okay. I have better recipes. I will admit that I commissioned my husband to make this one day when I was highly medicated on pain killers and couldn't cook dinner. I know he followed it exactly. The only criticism is that it was a little too thick and heavy for my preference.

Absolutely the best chili I have ever had.  I substituted black beans for the pinto beans because that's what I had.  Also, I only used one lb. of beef and one 28 oz can of tomato sauvce and omitted the tomato juice.  This made for a thick hearty chili that was so delicious.  My husband couldn't stop eating it!

This has become a regular in our household.  The only change I make is to only use half the beans, simply because I do not care for beans.

Love this chili!  If you like your chili super meaty and thick, this is probably not the recipe for you.  I think of this more as a chili soup with lots of great tomato flavor.  It's brothy and just spicy enough.  I usually add an additional can of beans and a little more cayenne.  Good served with cheese or sour cream and some fritos, or over rice.

This is a GREAT base chili! I have been using it for 2 years now and everyone just LOVES it. My husband and I don't care for tomatoes, onions, or green peppers (crazy, I know) so I omit those, but use the rest of the ingredients as written. Sometimes I add more of the seasonings if I desire a spicier chili. George did a great job!

Hey George! This recipe is perfect for messing around with. It's so good to begin with!   I also switched the juice for diced tomatoes, tomato soup & paste. I also added 2 garlic cloves, 1 can of mushrooms, 1 thai chili, 1/4 yellow pepper & 1/4 orange pepper and I used 1/3 cup of chili. It turned out AWESOME! Thanks so much for posting.

I made this vegetarian with Boca crumbles instead of beef.  I halved the amount of cayenne pepper because my kids are very fussy about spicy foods.  I think this will be my new standard chili recipe from now on.  It's delicious!

Good for rotation.  For the kids, I served on top of whole wheat spaghetti.  For myself (because its so unhealthy but so good), I put it on top of fritos and then sprinkled shredded cheese, green onions and sour cream on top.

I am making this in a crockpot now, perfect day for it 12 inches of snow has fallen and 12 more to fall.  It seems liquidy and i didnt put in as much juice as it calls for, I am nervous about this so I added some cornstarch hoping it will thicken up over the next 3 hours. Anyone make this in a crockpot and have suggestions ??  Thanks !

This recipe is great! I made some changes to it but kept the base pretty much the same! instead of the tomato juice i used 2 cans of diced tomatoes like some others recommended. Then I also sauteed the onions and bell pepper with the beef. Then I added everything and I also added a bit of flour to thicken it. It was great! I also added canned chili beans instead of regular beans which added more flavor and took out the cayenne pepper since i didn't have any on hand. Everyone loved it!

Great chili!  We use Morning Star veggie crumble instead of hamburger meat because it's faster, easier and healthier.  We've made it for guests 3 times and so far no one can tell the difference!

Very very good, made a few changes after reading other reviews. I doubled all the seasonings, and since I prefer a think hearty chili I substituted the Tomato juice with 2 15oz cans of diced tomatoes, and 1 12oz can of tomato paste.  I also subbed brown sugar for white. Yum. Gonna go eat some more now =)

Delicious!!!  My husband had been asking me to find a thicker/more tomatoey recipe for chili and we both love this!!!  A little trick I took from another recipe: stir in 1/2 cup of red wine about 20 minutes before done cooking (if done on the stovetop) or an hour and a half before done (if done in the crock pot).  Adds a little something to the recipe....I usually use a zinfandel or cabernet. :)

This chili recipe is fabulous!  The texture and thickness is perfect!  Like most people, I did make a few minor changes...instead of tomato juice, I used V-8.  Instead of pinto beans, I used black beans because I had them on hand.  Lastly instead of the tomato sauce, I used 2 cans of chili style diced tomatoes that I pureed with my hand blender...also because it's what I had on hand.  Even with these minor changes, I think I stayed pretty close to the original recipe.  This will be my "go to" chili recipe from now on!

Delicious Chili, and so easy! I always look for ways to make recipes healthier, so I made a few subtle changes. I substituted ground turkey meat for the ground beef (it's healthier, and with all the flavors and spice in this chili you won't be able to taste the difference. Trust me!). I added a little more onion and peppers than the recipe called for. I used a bottle of V8 juice (I didn't have tomato juice on hand). The second time I made this I purposely bought vegetable juice because the chili was so good this first time. I omitted the tsp of salt because the can of sauce that I used already had enough salt in it. I have found that a lot of recipes on this site require quite a bit of altering, but with this one you can follow the recipe exactly or slightly alter it, either way you will not be disappointed. Thanks George!

I admit I made some changes - mostly because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used ground chicken, stewed tomatoes (instead of tomato juice), omitted the pinto beans, doubled the sugar and added a clove of chopped garlic.  I served it over white rice and my family loved it!

This chili was awesome !!! The only thing I changed was the lean ground beef to ground chicken. I browned the chicken then put everything else in the crockpot and put it on high for about 7 hrs. I also made a slurry of 2tsp. of corn starch and 2 tsp. of water to thicken it up a bit because we topped nachos with it !!! It's a great game day chili ! THANKS!!!!!!

I have been looking for a great crockpot chili for a couple years now, and I found it!  I had this cooking in my crockpot all day and it turned out amazing!  Next time I will try adding the diced tomatoes and reducing the juice, I think with that little tweak it will make it just a bit better!

I love this recipe. I agree with the other viewer who said it makes a great base. I did use brown sugar in place of the white sugar and I threw a can of spagetti sauce in too. (made a large batch to freeze). Thanks for this recipe.

A good chili base, but definitely needed some more spice (and am a lightweight when it comes to heat). Will make again but with a few modifications.

This was pretty good. Very tomato-y in my opinion. I'm going to try a few more recipes before I settle on a for sure chili recipe.

Hey everyone I would have to say amazing I have never had chili before (Hate Beans) so i didnt add those I actually took it to my husbands chili cook off at work I showed up late so it wasnt voted on but everyone else loved it too even without the meat. My husband said it was the best hes ever tasted and he likes chili so that made me pretty happy he actually took the rest of the leftovers to work as burritos and he loves cheese and said these need neither cheese or crackers. Am making again tonight. One more thing im pregnant and my body seems to be very picky about what i eat i didnt even get heart burn a definate keeper. :)

Very, very good chili - once I had modified it a bit. I used 1 pound lean ground beef to 2 cans dark red kidney beans (didn't use pinto beans). I cooked half of the onion with the beef and half I stirred in later with the chopped green bell pepper. Used one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and this ration ended up being perfect. I actually had to double all spices and triple the cumin powder. I also put in about two tablespoons of Tabasco Chipotle Pepper Sauce and a small can of diced green chilies. Very hearty served with a sprinkling of shredded sharp cheddar on top.

By far, the best CHILI ever. But its not a soupy chili since I changed out the tomato juice for the tomatoes like most suggest. I also only use kidney beans. My husband doesn't care for pinto. Absolutely wonderful!!!

Found this dish to be very filling on a cool night. The only change that I made was to change the 46 oz. tomato juice to 32 oz. V-8 juice

This is the first year I've decided to cook! It was my first chili ever made and it was so easy and delicious! I also took out the juice and added 3 - 15oz cans one of each of stewed, plum and diced tomatoes. I will probably just use stewed next time. I didn't use pinto beans, but added a can of black beans and my fav in chili, garbonzo beans. Yum. I also decided to add mushrooms, celery, red pepper and corn. I WILL be making this again, my boyfriend says next week. :)

Followed recipe exactly. Had too much chili powder. Added 28 oz can diced tomatoes, 1 small can 16 oz? Bush's medium chili beans, 2 cups of water. That pretty much smoothed it out. It was pretty good, would make again.

Great all around chili! I made mine in the crock pot and set it on low for 8 hours.  It cooked down and the ground beef was really tender.  Before putting in the crock pot, I browned the ground beef with the onions, then put that in the crock pot and poured all the other ingredients in.  This would be a good recipe to try out using ground venison.  My husband liked it but said he would maybe like it a little spicier next time. Overall a great chili!

Absolutely outstanding recipe - Thanks So very much for sharing it . My mother told me it was the best I EVER made which is saying a lot because I've been developing & making my own recipe for nearly 30 years , adding as many of my own organically grown produce cause the quality of ingredients can make ALL the difference BUT not without a FanTastic recipe which your "Chili by George " is ! I will not waste your time with how/if I edited your recipe - to each their own taste AND "Chili By George" stands a top the best of chili recipes for me.

My husband made this and followed the recipe and not adding anything extra.  I did not care for it.  It has way too much tomato taste.  It's like having tomato soup with stuff in it.

SO GOOD! I play with the amount of spices just based on my taste preferance, and also...I saute the meat with onions first, then add everything to a slow cooker and just let the flavors melt together for a few hours...this is a no fail recipe and definitely a keeper!

This recipe has been a hit for me. A few tweeks were canned whole tomatoes and after they cook I stir and mash them up. I also add 1/2 cup of black coffee.  I have a store and serve easy lunch items for thecustomers in the area.  They want me to make it everyday.

My family doesn't like beans in their chili so I had to omit those. And I used half the tomato juice the second time that I made it so that it wouldn't be so soupy. I also added sausages and lots more cayenne. The base recipe was very good the first time and after making tweaks to match my family's taste it turned out amazing.  The taste is definitely more tomato-y at first but after letting it cook thru it blended perfectly!  THANKS!

Chili is a hard meal for me to get my 15 year old son to eat because of the diced tomatoes. This recipe is perfect for him and the rest of the family loved it, as well. The only thing I changed was I added one more can of kidney beans. I usually have leftovers when I cook chili, but not this time. Thanks George for the wonderful recipe, I give you 5 stars.

Used this as a guide to make a GIGANTIC batch of chili (quadrupled or more).  The spice blend was just what I needed, dumped in ALL of the chili powder I had in the house and still ended up short for the ammount I had, but it turned out perfect anyway.  Wonderful!

i have made this chili several times now and each time we love it!....i do omit the onions and green bell pepper due to a picky eater husband, however i do add a bit of onion powder instead....i have made this with the tomato juice and without and we prefer without b/c we like a thicker chili....i just add a couple cans of diced tomatos with juice in place of tomato juice...overall this is a great recipe to use...just tweak a bit to personal taste!

Absolutely love this recipe. The great thing about chili is that you can add things you want and omit things you don't want....so I didn't put bell pepper or sugar in mine and instead added a chopped jalepeno. Also, I cooked the ground beef with onion and some spices before putting it in the crock pot so it added some good flavor! Rather than adding tomato juice, I just used the juice one from of the cans of beans and it turned out perfect, not to liquid-y and not too thick.  Fantastic recipe! Big hit with my husband!

This chili is great.  If you like spicy chili you'll definitely need to double the spices.  My husband and I are going to try adding fresh jalapenos the next time we make it.

It was a good starter chili. The tomatoes were over powering, but it had a decent flavor otherwise. Very meaty and filling.

this is a great recipe, i have made it several time and I have now started to add a touch more spices to it, but it is also very good the way it is.  I used it and won the family chili cook off and came in 2nd at the chili cook of at my work.  it really is good!

I felt this recipe was too tomatoy (I know it is not a word, but people will understand). Overall, it turned out good. Depending on if you like alot of beans in your Chili, double the beans in this recipe. I will DEFINIATELY use this recipe again.

Absolutely great, I took the advice of other viewers and substitued the tomato juice for tomato sauce and substitued the tomato sauce for the can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion. I also used ground sausage instead of ground beef to give it that extra kick. It was delicious.

This recipe was great!  I substituted a 28 oz. can diced tomatoes undrained in lieu of the tomato juice.  I also doubled the cayenne.  It turned out excellent and received rave reviews from friends.  Thanks so much for the basics.

One of the best recipes on this site. First time I made it I stuck 100% to the recipe. Second time I added 1 can of Garbanzo beans and it was better , 3rd time added chunks of steak and garbanzo beans and served with warm corn bread , sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese... now thats just perfect for me :)

I love this recipe. I pretty much make it according to the directions. The only exception is that I omit the green bell pepper (my son doesn't like them). Otherwise, I make this as is and it's a big hit at my house. Serve with chopped yellow onion, green onions, sour cream, shredded cheddar, frito style chips. (The toppings make this great.)

Very good!  I didn't follow it exactly because I didn't have any tomato juice so I instead used a can of diced tomatoes, a can of diced tomotoes with peppers.  I also included 1/4 c brown sugar and a handful leftover peppers I had from the garden.  It was great!

Excellent!  Loved the tomato juice in this.  I did a couple packages of Williams chili seasoning and ommited the chili powder.  Still added cumin and oregano.  Used chili seasoned tomato sauce and chili beans.  Very good chili.

This is the first recipe that I ever tried off of the internet...about 8 years ago.  I remember this because the printed version of the recipe is still with me after 8 years and 4 houses later.  I can't tell you exactly how many times I have made this chili,  but it has been alot. I make it the same way every time.  If you follow George's recipe you will be pleased.  I do not recommend the slow cooker. I have only tried it that way once. The taste was good but the ground beef came out a littley clumpy.  To this day my wife, who did not like chili before, will not let me attempt a new recipe, not even for the sake of experimentation. It's a good chili recipe that a majority of the people are really going to enjoy.

Wow, this was good! I was almost tempted to put in some garlic, but decided to wait and see how the flavor turned out without it first. It definitely didn't need any adjustments. I followed the recipe as stated and it was perfect. One of the best chilis I've ever had.

This recipe was wonderful!  I'm so glad to have an easy traditional chili recipe.  Since I was just cooking for two, I cut the recipe in half but kept the same amount of beans and added 1 can of diced tomatoes.  You can definitely play around with the recipe and have a wonderful dish every time.  Make this!

I think this was great chili, it was a hit at my home.  I didn't have tomato juice so I used vegetable juice and it worked just as well.  I would probably add a bit more meat in it next time, but that's just a personal preference.

This is a great base for a chili recipe, which can then be altered to your taste. I didn't use any of the sweet ingredients because we don't like sweet mixed in with our food. I make this all the time!

My family now makes this occasionally because it is so good. It tastes better too the next day! The only thing I have done is added a little less chili powder and that makes it a little less spicy for me but besides that this recipe is good!

This is the best chili I have ever made.  Chili is one of those foods that is unique to your area and you develope a specific taste for.  George you hit the spot with this one.  This is the recipe I will use from now on.

I just made this and it was delicious. I added a little more Cayenne Pepper to give it a punch. I got lucky. This was my first time making Chili and it was borderline too spicy for me but my Husband loves it. Next time around I will definitely add chunky tomatoes for more texture and flavor. But this Chili as is would be great, too.

Wow, this was really really delicious!  I used ground chicken instead of beef because it was on sale at the grocery store (haha), and I used two teaspoons of cayenne pepper instead of 1/8th of a teaspoon (that really seems negligibly small) and 1 extra teaspoon of salt.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly!

I made this chili for my dad and Uncles for football Sunday and it was a big hit! I took the advice from other reviews and substituted diced tomatoes in their own juices for the tomato juice, and it made the chili nice and hearty. I also added an extra half a can of both beans and it made all the difference.

This is a really nice meaty chili. The biggest change I made was to add fresh tomatoes instead of canned- i didn't have any canned on hand but I think I liked the fresh better! Also, I cut down on the juice.

I loved the taste, but it was way too thin/soupy for my liking.  Next time, I would cut down on the tomato soup and maybe add some tomato paste to thicken it up a bit.

My husband is very picky about his chili and I have never found the receipe that will suit him.  He and I both loved this recipe!!  I used diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice, added a can of corn and black beans, and added half the onions near the very end of cooking for more crunchy texture.  It was great!!

This recipe is good (not great).  Its a safe chili to cook for those who might be picky.  I would have liked more spice/kick.

Excellent Chili - I subbed the diced tomatoes for the tomato juice after reading others reviews, and went a little heavy handed on the spices - made it the night before for the Tailgate (Go Vols!) and cooked it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high.  It was fantastic and drew rave reviews - everyone loved the big chunks of onion and Green Pepper, as they still had body to them - my only addition next time will be a can of corn, as I think that may give a little more texture also - this one will defeinitely stay in my recipe box for a long time!

Like others, I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice (which helped thicken it up since I used a slow cooker). Along with the green bell pepper I also put in some yellow since I had some left over. Next time I'll add a jalapeno since I like spicy, but it was a little spicy without. All in all the best chili recipe I've used so far - other onces always had a little sweetness to them and this one was just perfect!

My family loved this recipe.  They said it was much better than the other chili that had made in the past.  I made a few slight changes: I used 2 cans petite diced tomatoes - chili style- in their juices instead of the tomato juice.  In addition, I used only 3/4 cup onions because I have 3 kids who don't like onions that much.  Other than that, I left the recipe the same.  I served with mini corn muffins.  Delicious!

I thought this chili was easy to make and tasted very good.  I left out the onion and green pepper since I don't like those and it still had plenty of flavor.  I tried doing the stewed tomatos instead of tomato juice like others suggested and mine came out too thick, think I'll try the juice next time.  Pleased my 2 year old and my very picky husband!

Just the recipe we were looking for...perfect for us with a few changes - only 1 pound of meat but three cans of beans: 1 pork & beans, 1 chili beans, and 1 kidney beans - more sugar - and only chili powder to taste because of the seasoned chili beans.  Half as much tomato juice & a can of undrained petite diced tomatoes.  The rest of the ingredients (sauce, spices, veggies) as listed.

I made some slight changes... Instead of using 1 can of tomato juice, I increased the tomato sauce to 32 ounces, added one small can of tomato paste about about a cup of water.  All in all, 5 stars!  One of the best recipes for chili I've had in a long time!

Very good.  Used kidney and pinto beans (both were dry, so I soaked them all day in water).  B/c they hadn't been in cans, the beans were still pretty firm after cooking...which was a nice change of pace from regular chili, which tends to be mushy.  Very hearty feel to the chili with these beans.  Could use more spiciness next time, so I'll probably tweak the spices.   The "10 servings" is way out of whack; served 4 bowls last night and I've got another 8-12 left over for freezing.

This chili is really perfect. Honestly I don't think chili can be too tomato-y. I used V-8 for the juice and even added a can of crushed spicy tomatoes.Yum. Best I've had.

I have made this 2 times.  The 1st time I followed the recipe exactly with alright results.  The 2nd time I added 2 cans of rotel diced tomato's with green chili's and one can stewed tomato's.  Also instead of using the seasonings,  I purchased 2 packages of chili seasoning,  (it's usually with the gravy mixes) and replaced the beans with a 30 oz. can of drained chili beans. This turned out to be a heartier chili and my family and friends really enjoyed it.

Absolutely great!!!  This was really good.  I made it last night and it FAB.  I made it exactly as stated with a few minor changes; added garlic and turkey meat.

This is a great recipe that you can add ingredient to and it is still perfect.  I always add mushrooms, additional bell peppers and fresh chopped tomatoes.

I loved this chili!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting diced tomatoes for the tomato juice because I like thick chili.  I thought the flavor was excellent, especially with shredded cheese on top!  Nice one, George!

I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the molasses as others suggested and I was very disappointed in the result. There was no flavor and my guests found it bland.

it's my first time making chili and i'm glad to say that this was a HUGE hit in my house. as suggested by some reviewers, i only used one can of tomato juice, 2 cans od diced tomatoes and used one small can of tomato paste, but i pretty much followed the recipe and it tasted great. i'll definitely be making this again!

Fabulous! I did 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice, doubled the beans and added a few spoon fulls of salsa to add an extra kick. LOVE this recipe and will be making it a lot this winter!

We have a big get together every year and everyone insists now that I bring the chili - which is made from this recipe.  I double the recipe and use crused or diced tomatoes for half the juice.  Thanks George!

Well, I have been simmering this for 4 hours now in the crockpot...it is fantastic already!  Can't wait to make some cornbread to dip in it!!  Only changes were to up the spice a bit except for chili & cayenne, along with some more kidney beans and whole tomatoes w/juices instead of tomato juice.

I thought this was fantastic.  You can use it as a base to get started and then add whatever you want to make it your own.  I ended up substituting diced tomatoes for some of the tomato juice because I wanted it to be more hearty.  It turned out great and everyone loved it!

So good! I added an extra can of pinto beans in chili sauce and cut the chili powder back to 2 tablespoons. I also added some red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup of diced red bell pepper. My husband and I agree that this is our new favorite chili recipe.

This is really good.  Made it in the Crock pot. Cut back about half on the spices. Not a real fan of a lot of heat. Will make again. As suggested also used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice.

This was really good! I didn't have tomato juice, so I did a bit of improvising. I used a can of tomato soup, added half a can of water, 2 cans of tomato sauce, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, and a can of crushed tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, but just let it simmer for a few hours on low in my dutch oven. Has a nice kick to it. Very tasty with cheese, sour cream, and fritos :)

Very yummy.  I doubled the beans (4 cans instead of 2) and added a tablespoon of cocoa powder.  I simmered it for about 1 hour (with the lid off) and all the flavors seemed perfect together.  I served it over elbow noodles and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  I will make this again.

I thought this was pretty good! It was a little watery so I would cut down on the tomato juice next time.  I used 2 cans black beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 can red beans.  I will make again!

I love this chili recipe. It is perfect for cool nights when we have a lot of practices. (like tonight) All the kids love this chili. I do have some that are not fans of green peppers, so I do ommit those every once in a while. It has been a little thin when I make it on the stove, so I add a little bit of tomato paste to thicken it up. Great recipe! Thanks George!!

What a great base recipe. I also used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice, upped the kidney beans as here in Australia couldnt find pinto. Put it in my crockpot and just magic after 8 hours. This is a real keeper.

I was very very VERY happy with this recipe!!  So many chili recipes these days try to add new ingredients, making chili not taste like the good old-fashion, hearty, tomato-based chili that I grew up on.  This one was perfect in my eyes!!!  I even followed the recipe exactly and it suited my taste without having to play with any seasonings!  Loved it!

I really liked it, my husband liked it though he doesn't like beans in his chili.  The kids, on the other hand, were mixed in their reviews but what do they know?  ;)  I will make this again.

This recipe was amazing!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice and I doubled the cumin because it's my favorite spice.  In addition, I did add a couple of adobe peppers like another review suggested and this did give it a bit of a kick.  I will add more kidney beans next time because I like my chili hearty.   I gave this recipe a 5 because it is a great base recipe and it seems that you can't go wrong no matter how you adjust the recipe.  Will make again soon.

Good hearty chili. I did use vegetable juice instead of tomato and cut it by about a cup and I did replace the canned beans with a 15oz bag of dried black beans because that is what I had on hand, this added to the cooking time but definitely still really good.

I used this recipe for the first time I ever made chili and I thought it turned out great.  I cut the recipe in half thinking that it would be way to much, I wish had more!!

A great recipe for a beginner. I found many different recipes on this website and this one seamed the simiplest and easiest to make. Plus, I already had everything on hand. I, like other reviewers, did not use tomato juice. Rather, I removed the skin off of four tomatoes, diced them, covered them in water, and cooked until boiling. Then, I pureed them and add them in replace of the juice. A bit complicated, but it save me a trip to the store. Thanks for the recipe!

this was just "okay"; nothing special, but it tasted fine . . . I was just expecting "spectacular" from all of the reviewers.

this makes the best chili.  I generally add more beans because I like my chili quite thick.  This is a spicy delicious chili that I have made many times.  i keep it in the freezer and have somewhenver I like.  TWhen it is gone I make up some more. Filling with a low calorie content.

I also used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and didn't drain the kidney or pinto beans. Very good and hot enough for my husband and me. I have been looking for a good chili for a long time.

I accidentally used 1 tsp. sugar, 1 tsp. oregano, and 1 tsp. black pepper.  It turned out PERFECT!
I left out the beans and bell pepper.

This is a great simple crockpot recipe.  I used 1 - 15 oz of tomato sauce and 1 - 15 oz can of diced tomatoes for chili.  It was sure easy after broning the meat.  It was even better the second night for our guests!  KR - Hermiston, OR

Really easy to cook for a first time Chili maker. My boyfriend liked the corn bread more (traderjoes box) We both like spicy so i added red pepper flakes.  I think next time i'll add garlic while browning the meat. But I can't complain to much, it is going to feed us for a couple days!

Very, very good. Followed recipe (almost) using a slow cooker. Couldn't find Pinto so only used Red Kidney beans. Instead of chili powder, used Mexican hot Jalapeno sauce.
2nd try - Used Dutch oven on stove. Used Kidney - still can't find Pinto so I used Roma beans. Substituted diced tomato instead of tomato juice. Doubled spices and again used Mexican hot sauce, (limited) - EXCELLENT!!!!!!

Tried it again - this time on the stove. Again, no Pinto availabale so I used cans of Lentils and Red Kidney. Used a small can of diced tomatos instead of tomato juice (along with some ketchup & salsa). Used brown sugar instead of white. Went easy on the spices. Served it up with shredded cheddar and fritos topping - even better than the first time - It's now a 5* !!

This turned out great!  I followed the recipe as written and did add a TBS. of cocoa powder as one person had suggested.  I tried it just as a soup before putting it over noodles and it was great.  Even better once I added the cheese and sour cream!  My hubby even gobbled this up and went back for more.  Thanks for the recipe George!

Not bad. Only used 1# of meat (family not big meat eaters), added roughly 2 CUPS celery, and it was pretty good.

This was delicious!! I added some Jalapenos to make it spicy and bacon because my boyfriend loves bacon in everything.  This goes great with breadsticks wrapped in bacon and sprinkled with cheese (15 min in the oven @ 350).

I really like this chili, just got done making a pot.  The amount of tomato juice scared me but I left the lid ajar a bit for an hour while it simmered and it thickened up to where I like it.  I didn't use any onions or green peppers, I like to put chopped onions on top after the chili is done.  I also added some red pepper and a bay leaf cause I had them from another chili recipe I tried last weekend.

I have tried many recipes for chili in the past, and I have to say that this is my favorite. I only made one adjustment, and that was taking out the tomato juice and adding 1 small can of fire roasted tomatoes, and also one small can of additional tomato sauce. Great recipe, I also served it with homemade cornbread! Thanks

This chili rocks! It's so tasty and hearty. My husband requests this often! The only thing I added to the recipe was red bell pepper (yellow might make a nice addition too!) and a can of diced tomatoes. I used ground turkey meat instead of ground beef. For the tomato juice, I used a can of V-8 Spicy. Definitely a keeper!

Easy and tasty chili.  We loved it.  doubled the beans and just used canned kidney beans - didn't have the green pepper - doubled the cumin for that smoky light heat it brings. Used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and only used 1 lb of ground beef. My family - especially my husband - LOVED it!  Smelled great cooking along in the crockpot all day and came out thick and deeply colored. Delicious.

This is my go-to chili recipe.  The last time I made it, I did substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce for the tomato juice.  I also used cubed stew beef (my husband's suggestion).  It tuens out great every time!

I really liked this recipe. I am a flavor junky so I probably tripled the amount of cayenne pepper, onions, and peppers. Next time, I may add even more vegetables. Also, I made it with turkey instead of beef and you can't tell the difference.

Wow, that is some good Chili!!! I added a can of sliced mushrooms, not cause it needed it, because I love mushrooms, and threw in a whole chopped green pepper instead of the 1/4 cup. This was awesome! I don't usually eat chili but after I tested it I found myself filling a bowl. YUMMY!! :)

Fabulous! Instead of real ground beef, I substituted black beans and Morning Star crumbles! It turned out just right. The only change I made was I added 1/4 cup extra chili powder. Thanks for the fab recipe!

I don't usually like chili but my husband does so I wanted to find a good one. Also, I signed up to take a crockpot full to a social function.  I made this for 25 servings, based on the calculate tool, and it was awesome.  The only thing I changed was to substitute two cans of rotel for one large can of tomato sauce, because I didn't have quite enough.  I made half in the crockpot and half on the stove. Usually chili is too thick to me, but this is the perfect consistency.  Perfect with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  Made SO much, but I froze some for another night.

this is my first time making chili but wow it is SO tasty. i subbed in turkey instead of beef - gotta TRY to be healthy sometimes right? sauteed the turkey with the onion and oregano. i added in some corn, an onion, a green bell pepper and some canned jalapeno for extra kick. i also did as some reviewers suggested and put in two cans of tomatoes, juice and all. i love the taste of cumin and oregano, so i added more to suite my taste. by the time i threw everything into the pot, i snuck in a taste and WOW! it was beyond what i expected, even with all these glowing reviews. great recipe George!

I've made chili many, many times but not one to use a recipe for it.  I tried this recipe because it was recommended, easy to make and looked like it would satisfy all tastes (I tend to make mine way too hot). I only made one change but not one I planned. I accidently opened a can of black beans so decided to just add it with the kidney and pinto beans. Great consistancy!! I figured it would be runny with all the liquid added. Wanted to stick with the recipe as listed before I made a change. I will definitely keep this as my favorite basic chili recipe and know that it will please the kids and my parent. Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good! I made it a tad too spicy, and extra sweet, but still very good. I served with sour cream and Worcester Tabasco (they don't sell this locally but it's great) sauce and tortilla chips. It was a daunting preparation, but worth it!

this chili has a good flavor however it was a little thin for my taste. I prefer chunks of tomatoes in my chili. I enjoyed the pinto beans as i typically just use kidney beans. The spice combination is good.

I tweak this recipe a little to suit my tastes but it is really good. Instead of using tomato juice I use a 15 oz. can of spaghetti sauce and two 15 oz. cans of petite diced tomatoes along with the 29oz. of spaghetti sauce the recipe calls for. I also use 1 can of kidney beans and 2 cans of black beans. It's a favorite with my family with a little dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese on top.

Outstanding basic recipe!  After making this over 20 times I have added my own twist :  I use low sodium V8 juice, add  1 lb sausauge when browning the meat,  2 cloves garlic, 2 tsp worcestershire sauce, 1 14 az can seasoned diced tomatoes,2 tsp Franks hot pepper sauce, 1 T brown sugar, 1 tsp liquid smoke, 1/2 cup beef broth, 1/2 package hot cocoa mix.  I also double the oregano and add 2 extra cans of kidney beans.  
This recipe is a wonderful base to add your own touches.  Thanks to George for a great recipe and inspiring me to make it my own

With a household the size of an army, I needed an easy recipe.  This recipe has not extras, and quick to prepare.  I have tried many chili recipes over the year, and was amazed at how great this one was.  I would recommend this recipe for any and all chili lovers.  This was the greatest!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made a pot for 50 people and everyone loved it.  I did alter it just a little by adding 1 can of chili seasoned diced tomatoes and pureed instead of tomatoe sauce.  I would definately recommed this chili!

It's a tasty, very easy to make recipe that delivers.  If you like it hot though, add more chili powder and cayenne.  Will definitely make this one again.

Delicious recipe.  I soak dry beans overnight for a little more texture in the chili.  I add some brown sugar. For extra smoky spice I add two La Costena chipotle peppers in adobe sauce and a teaspoon or so of sauce and onion from the can.  I skip the tomato juice and add one large can diced or whole tomatoes and some water.  Add a little extra of all of the spices.

Pretty good chili. I didn't have tomato juice so I sub it for 4 c. of water and about 2/3 c. of bbq (jack daniel's).  Simmered in a crockpot for 8-9 hours. Served this with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread.

This recipe was very good overall.  I didn't feel like there were enough beans so I doubled what the recipe said to use.  We like tomatoes in our chili and for it to be a little thicker.  So next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time) I am going to lessen the amount of tomato juice and add some diced tomatoes.

My family loved this.  Used tomato sauce and stewed tomatoes (because I had on hand) instead of the tomato juice and added some Rotel Mexican tomato with lime and cilantro. Just the right kick for us.  Will make this a regular on our menu.

To date, this recipe has 870 reviews, it really doesn't need another...but I am going to anyway. I started making this chili last november. Love it. It is the perfect blend of all the seasonings. It really is the best.

YUM!! I wanted to try a different chili recipe from what I usually do and this was great. I doubled most of the spices and added a red pepper since I had it on hand. I didn't have any cayenne pepper but would definitely add it next time for more kick.

used 1 can V8 tom. juice and 2 cans of Rotel. I used brown sug. instead of white and I added 3 cloves of garlic. Everyone enjoyed! I still think the "boilermaker tailgate chili" from this website is my favorite- dont let the ingredient list scare you- its worth it!

Very good basic recipe! I made some changes. No green peppers and cayenne pepper. No tomato juice. I used a can of diced tomatoes and a bit more tomato sauce. I also used 3 tablespoons brown sugar in place of the white sugar, per another reviewer. And I only used about 3/4 tablespoon chili powder, and will only use 1/2 tablespoon next time - but I have no tolerance for spicy foods. My husband really liked this chili. It will definitely be on our menu several times a month.

Excellent chili.  Nothing more to say.  Easy to make, quick, and delicious.  And not too spicy, just how I like it.  I had 6 other people eat it with me and they all LOVED it.

really, really yummy!!  I usually just get the Mccormick brand spices but this is just awesome!  Most of the ingredients I already had on hand so it was one of those put it together and go recipes!!  Very easy and very good!  It definitely has a kick but not too much spice.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This had a very great flavor but we found it too saucey or soupy.  Next time I will cut back on the juice and use a can of petite diced tomatoes.  But again - great flavor...thanks!

Excellent.  Followed the suggestion to replace the tomato juice with canned tomatoes (diced).  It was awesome.

Recipe was a great base.  I did a bit of tweeking for personal taste.  Added 2 TBSP brown sugar instead of white, 1 1/2 tsp. Oregano, replaced tomato sauce with spaghetti sauce, 2 cans stewed tomato for tomato juice.  I like my chili a bit on the thin side so I also added one beer and water as needed to thin out.   Add shredded cheese with sour cream and corn bread with honey on top and YUM!

I really loved this recipe and so did my 18 month old and husband. Although to make it a bit healthier I put in a package of morningstar grillers, 1/2 lb ground beef, and 1/2 lb ground turkey. Used diced tomatoes and a jar of spaghetti sauce didn't have the juice on hand. I also, used about 3/4 of 15 oz cans of kidney and red beans since otherwise it seemed a bit much). I cut down the chili powder because of my daughter and added in a handful of cornmeal.

My boyfriend couldn't get enough of this chili. I'm making it again one week later because he keeps craving it! It's excellent! I added a few chipotle chiles to the pot for that smokey flavor... yummy!

I made this for a Chili lunch at work.  Everyone loved it, just the right amount of spice for me (mild-medium). This chili was the first to go out of 6, and people went back for seconds or thirds.  I would say its a pretty standard chili recipe.  I will make this recipe over the previous recipes I used to make.

I used this recipe as a starting off point and the result was VERY good! I made a lot of modifications because I lacked many of the ingredients.  I used 1 1/2 lbs ground turkey (instead of beef), 2 cans of stewed tomatoes with juices (instead of tomato juice and sauce), 2 cans of pinto beans (no kidneys), 1/4 cup dried onions (no fresh), and then double the amount of all the seasonings (except 1/2 the chili powder because I ran out).  Plus, I added a jalapeno (I might add 2 next time) and a couple dollops of tomato paste to thicken it.  This was actually the best chili I've ever had!

This chili is WONDERFUL! I don't like beans so I just subed 1 lb pork sausage for all the beans. I threw everything into the crock pot and it was perfect. My husband came home and could smell it from outside the house. He couldn't wait to try it. So delicious!

Awesome chili!  Not too spicy, not too mild, just perfect.  I made a few minor adjustments due to the absence of a few items in my kitchen.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used 2 dashes of hot sauce and in place of the fresh onion and green pepper I used a frozen mix of onions and three peppers (red, yellow & green).  Turned out wonderful!  I've already made it twice and plan on making it over and over again.

This is a great recipe! I halved the recipe (it's just my husband and I) but I added all the beans, instead of tomato juice I used half a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes. (15 oz. cans). I cooked the hamburger with about a tablespoon of minced garlic and the onions, I added a whole teaspoon of brown sugar instead of white, and last but not least I added slightly less chili powder as I like a milder chili. This came out AWESOME!

Great recipe as is!  The great thing about chili is that you can add whatever you have on hand... some of my favorite things to add are chopped green chilies instead of the bell pepper and I add 2 cans each of the beans...just my preference.  You won't be sorry trying this recipe as is! Thanks for the recipe!

I  made this for my in-laws visiting from out of town and everyone LOVED it.  I did add 3 tbs of brown sugar and used turkey.  I didn't make it spicey since we had kids but everyone just added Texas Pete to their own bowls to spice it up.

I've used this recipe several times and my friends and family love it! the only thing that I've changed about the recipe was I add brown sugar instead of white. I also added green peppers,red peppers, orange peppers, yellow peppers, and 2 cloves of garlic minced. I sauté all the veggies and I also substituted ground turkey for the ground beef.

I would give this more than 5 stars, if I could.  I substitute crushed tomatoes for the tomato juice and up the amount of beans by a can or so.  I also use canned diced chiles or a can or two of rotel.  My family loves it!!  It won an award at a chili cook-off.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good chili!  I halved the recipe and the changes i made were: 2 1/2 cups cooked black beans, a can of tomatos that i diced and included the juice, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 2 1/4 teaspoons cumin (didnt use chili powder). I left the rest the same just used half. It came out delicious! I did sautee the onion with the meat and drained. this made enough for 5 people. But not gigantic portions. So if you want to eat ALOT i would stick with the recipe :)

Went over really well with my crowd. They felt it wasn't the best chili they ever had but it was very good. Lots of veggies like spinach, carrots, grated zucchini is a good addition for a healthier alternative.

I have never made chili before tonight.  I will be making this again.  It was really good and very simple to make.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  The only thing I did differently was to double the bell pepper (only because I chopped 1/2 cup and I didn't want to waste it) and I also added a can of Ranch Style Beans (pintos with jalapenos) because I had it and I thought the chili looked light on beans. The chili was a little spicier than I expected but that could be due in part to the can of Ranch Style Beans that I added.  I topped mine with some shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  It was very good!

Made this for my daughter's winter birthday party. BRR! It went over well.  Served with hot dogs and toppings for chili cheese dogs and also used for bowls of chili.  I substituted ground turkey for price and better health. LOL.  No one knew the difference.

I love this recipe. I read other reviws and used stewed plum tomatoes instead of the tomatoe juice.  I use ground turkey breast to make it leaner and add chick peas.

"By George" we have a winner! Easily made,easy to tinker with,guaranteed no leftovers.I used 2 1/2 lbs.chili meat instead of ground beef. I did not add 46oz tomato juice. I sub'd water for juice. 1 teaspoon beef base instead of salt. 2 teaspoons cumin. Rinsed/drained both beans together and added last 20 minutes of cook cycle ( they stay whole and will not go mushy on you ). The rest of the ingredients are the same. This will be the one for all time in my family. Remember everybody has different taste, so simmer slowly and take your time adding spices to get your taste buds to smiling! Especially with the cumin!

This chili is the best! It was my first time making chili and it didn't last in my house. The only thing I changed was I didn't use tomato juice so I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of rotel, couldn't find a 29 oz can of tomato sauce and saw puree and bought that and it was wonderful.Thank you so much for sharing George.

Great basic chili. I wish I would have followed the recipe and added all the tomato juice. It looked like too much so I omitted some and the chili ended up a little thick. Still tasted good though.

I tried the stewed tomatoes ((in the food processor)) but wasn't sure how much to use. So I used two cans. It seemed fine at first but then got real runny. There wasn't much to the flavor either. I added TONS of seasoning but it just didn't have the kick that my MILs chili seems to have. I will just ask her what she does next time. This was just OK ((as my 13 yr old said...it is chili))

Everyone loved this!  Substituted one can crushed tomato and one can diced tomato with chilis in place of the tomato juice.  Added 1/2 cup water. Put it all in the crockpot - so easy! This is a keeper!  Even my chili-picky husband loved it!

This is a great recipe with a few minor changes.  First, if you plan on using the crockpot cut the tomoato juice in half.  I used the whole jar of juice and it came out way to thin.  I also added a package of taco seasoning, cut the chili powder in half and added a can of drained chili beans. I was pleased with the outcome and so was my husband.  I will make this one again!

This is a nice chili recipe, but I have to question the 1/4 cup chili powder.  I reduced the amount to about 1 1/2 tablespoons and added a can of whole plum tomatoes.  Otherwise, it was very tasty.

This chili as written is easy and good. It seems pretty basic and versatile.  I didn't quite follow the recipe, as I didn't have hamburger.  I used beef kielbasa instead.  Bf really liked it, but I was not a fan of my own substitute with the kielbasa.  I like the chili flavors, just didn't like the keilbasa with it.  Since that's my sub, I am not docking the recipe itself.  Didn't have pinto beans, so I used black beans instead.  It cooked up just fine in the crockpot while I was at work.  I will probably make again without that darn kielbasa.  This makes a lot, so it would be a good recipe to freeze half of.  Thanks!

This chili is awesome! The only thing I omitted was the tomatoe juice. I used stewed tomatoes (same amount) instead to add more texture.  Other than that this recipe is a definite keeper!

This chili was so good, I couldn't help but sneak into the frige at night to take little bites of the leftovers. My only changes we're to omit the tomato juice for a can of whole tomatoes which I chopped up. Also I used all pinto beans, since I'm a wierdo and I don't like kindey. Lastly, just added a little chopped up jalapeno! My hubby is going to give me a hard time for breaking into the chili I set aside for his lunch tomorrow...lol!

Wonderful, easy Chili.  I have never been able to make Chili and like it, until this recipe.  I loved it, and it taste wonderful.  I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and only used half of the tomato sauce.  You will truely love this Chili.

I used Dark Red Kidney beans, as I do not like pinto beans, I also didn't use Cumin as I was out. I used three times as much cayenne pepper and thought it still wasn't too spicy.

I cut the recipe in half and made the following changes...I used one can of kidney beans and omitted the pinto beans.  I used brown sugar in lieu of white sugar as recommened by others.  I prefer a thicker chili so I used one can of diced tomatoes and juice and only one small can of tomato sauce and one small can of spicy V8 juice.  I browned 1 lb. ground moose meat with the onions a 1 clove of garlic before I added it to the slow cooker.  Just remember that chili is personal and you can always add more liquid as it cooks.  Will definitely make again and again!

Its my go to chili recipe. Thanks George!!!. the only thing I changed was, instead of the tomato juice, I added two large cans of diced tomatoes with the juice, and then added enought juice (Mr T;s Blody Mary Mix) to make it of the consistancy that I like.

With this recipe it gives you the grounds to make it your own chili.... 
When the weather gets that chill in the air my family asks when I am going to make the chili. 
This recipe also works great if you busy.. just put all the itmes a slow cooker for 8 hours (of course after you brown the meat). 
Makes the house smell warm and is just wonderful

I like many others didn't use the tomato juice, I use various different types of tomato mixtures. I will use like paste, diced, and crushed tomatoes. Ive had a lot of people love my chili including my boyfriend who never eats leftovers. This is the only thing he ever chows down on and actually eats the next day. It's a good recipe.

My whole family loved this--even my 6-year-old daughter who doesn't like spicy foods that much.  She kept saying it was really spicy but ate two bowls!  I only used 1 pound of ground beef just to make it a little healthier.  I also just threw in the tomato products I had--some whole canned tomatoes, homemade tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of exactly the amounts the recipe called for.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, and I'm not a chili fan ordinarily.  I did everything by the recipe, except I added some chopped "hot pepper" (my grocery store did not have them labeled clearly), and my boyfriend put in an indeterminate amount of Texas Pete.  It was yum!

DELICIOUS!!!! Such an amazing flavor combination. I did make a few changes to mine though 1)add 2 fresh diced tomatoes 2)used 3 beef boullions dissolved in 2 cups water instead of tomato juice 3)add 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce, 4 tablespoons ketchup, and 1 tablespoon worschestire sauce 4)add 3 cloves garlic, chopped 5)used 1 can chili beans in spicy sauce instead of pintos 6)use 1 tsp brown sugar instead of white sugar 7)add 1/4 cup real bacon bits..... I ended up using 1 pound fresh ground beef with 3 large leftover hamburger patties (from dinner I cooked the night before) that I crumbled up. I combined everything (except the fresh meat) in the crock pot the night before and let it sit in the fridge til morning. Woke up and browned the fresh meat and then added it to the pot and let it cook on low for about 10 hours. Came home and was BLOWN AWAY by the aroma alone. Smelled soooo good! This was my first time making home made chili and I got so many compliments from my guests. Served with shredded cheddar, sour cream, and cornbread as a side! YUM! You can really alter it to your own personal taste but this was a good base. Will definitely be making again!

This chili is amazing. but like a lot of people I have tweaked the recipe. I omitted the tomato juice, cumin & white sugar. I added 29oz can of diced tomatoes, 1 can white kidney beans, rinsed & drained, 1 T brown sugar, 1/4c of hot sauce. Thanks George for some great chili!!!!

YUMMY! This recipe was excellent! I substituted 1 can of "chili ready" rotel for the tomato juice. Also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, a little tabasco. My husband doesn't like onions, so i used 1/4 tsp onion powder instead. We like to top it with shredded cheddar cheese and Fritos as an extra crunch! Will pass this recipe along! Thanks!

Great chili recipe!  I was having a large group of people over for lunch and decided to give this a try. I used two 14oz. cans of diced tomatoes with the juice instead of the 46 oz can of tomato juice. I also added black olives and two small cans of chopped green chilis.  I also substituted black beans for pinto beans and topped with cheddar cheese.  Everyone loved it!

It was something that grew on me. The first bit was not spicy or to flavorful. By the third bit we were satisfied and to grew more spice. I did use ground turkey so maybe hamburger would have more flavor. Next time it think I will sub some crushed tomatoes for some of the juice.

By far the greatest chili recipe out there! however I did change / add a few things. First I used tomato sauce instead of the juice and whole tomatoes instead of the the sauce I also added a jalapeno pepper minced and of course some garlic other than that recipe was to the T. I highly recommend to all !

E-A-S-Y! This is the first time I have made homemade chili, and I was a little hesitant because I usually hate anyones who have made it. But this was absolutely delicious! Everyone agrees too!

Per other suggestions, left out cayenne pepper, used brown sugar instead of white, and used only two heaping tbs. of chili powder. A complete hit!

This was my first time making chili, and I was lucky to find the perfect recipe.  My boyfriend and I love spicy food (being southerners and all), so I put in Louisiana hot sauce and hot cherry peppers along with the chili powder.  The result was a hot, thick chili that was devoured almost immediately.  We're hurting now, but it was worth it! Thanks, George!

I had originally provided a higher rating for this chili, but I'm sure it must have been with modifications. When prepared as written...this recipe is waaaay too soupy. Too much tomato juice! Next time, I will either reduce that ingredient or replace it with diced tomatoes. Also, definitely add more chili powder and cumin. I used chipotle powder in place of the cayenne and it contributed a nice smoky flavor.

Very good! I cut the recipe in half since I don't need 10 servings of chili, so I used 1 lb. ground beef, 1 small onion, 1/2 green pepper, 1 jalepeno seeded and chopped, canned diced tomatoes instead of the juice and two full cans of beans. I like my chili bean-y! I also increased the cayenne and chili powder since I like mine with a little kick. Threw everything into my slow cooker on High for 4 hours. Also added 1/2 bottle dark beer..I'm always looking for an excuse to cook with beer and this chili loved the beer..it meshed well with the cumin and heartiness of the beans. Served it with "Honey Cornbread" from this site and plenty of cheese on top. Yum!

Very good chili recipe. Followed suggestions and substituted couple cans of diced tomatoes in place of 1/2 the tomato juice. Great basic starter recipe, going to have fun playing with diffrent ways to perfect it to our tastes!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars. It is a really great chili that adapts easily to suit individual tastes. Want more spice? Add it! Feeding a family with kuds? Leave it as-is. Easy Peasy! I always make this in the crock pot and it never fails to be a huge hit. On a personal note - I do not use the tomato juice; instead, I use stewed tomatoes. It makes the chili very hearty.

I just made this last night & everyone enjoyed it!  We had a little leftover that I'm having for lunch - it's even better the next day!  I had to make a minor adjustment since I didn't have canned beans.  I used a pound of dried pinto beans instead (cooked them w/quick soak method to soften before adding).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was wonderful!  Thanks!

This is a really good basic chili recipe.  Very easy to make and not too spicy.  My husband and I love it.

It was a good base recipe. I omitted the bell peppers and added 2 cans of rotel w green chili. I also added tabasco and red pepper flakes. For the beans I used beans with jalepenos. Over all it was really good and easy.

I had not made chili for a very long time and came across this recipe. I took it to a dinner and had a lot of compliments. I added diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and sauce. It turned out very thick and very good. I will make it again very soon.

I do not like chili and have never made it before this. With that said, I really enjoyed this chili. It is a good "base" chili to get someone like me without a chili recipe started. I will definitely use this recipe again and make the changes necessary to meet my families taste buds. I decided to cook this all day in a crock pot and it turned out wonderfully. Thanks for sharing!

Really good chili! My friend loves bananas and beans (call her weird..) and she actually blended a banana into her tomato juice which gave it a really unique edge. I like both versions.

This chili was awesome!  I made some very slight changes, I don't like green peppers, so I used red bell peppers.  Also, I didn't have any oregano, so I used basil.  Other than that, I followed the recipt to the T, and my family and my friends absolutely loved it!!  I added some red pepper flakes into my own bowl to make mine hotter, but the batch was just right for kids!

Everyone loved this so much that they looked forward to leftovers the next day.  The pinto beans give it a wonderful flavor.  Next time I'm going to add yellow peppers as well.

I served this chili to a group of friends this weekend and they all loved it!  I added 3 cans of chopped tomatoes (2 w/oregano & garlic and 1 plain can) and the tomato sauce (but I added 1 can of water to thin it out some).  I also used ground "chili" meat (chili grind) but kept everything else the same.  No more 2 alarm chili mix for us - this is much better.

This excellent recipe helped me win my work's chili cookoff that was on TV (CW 31's Good Day Sacramento)!  I added Italian sausage and more tomato sauce and spices plus an extra can of kidney beans to stretch out the recipe. I let it simmer for hours on the stove and it tasted better over time. Thank you George for the wonderful recipe!

This is the best chili ever!!  I made it for my boyfriend and his whole family and now they all think I make the world's best chili!  The only change I make is I don't use the whole 46oz of tomato juice... I proably only use about a 1/3 of it.  It gives the chili a better consistency and has more kick!  I've also subsituted the red meat for ground turkey... you can't even tell!

I made chili for the Super Bowl this year.  I didn't have a half of a gallon of tomato juice so i used 12 oz of paste with about 36 oz of water.  I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1/2 pound Jimmy Dean sausage, no peppers and i only used 1 15oz can of kidney beans.  After the chili was done I had bowls of elbow macaroni, pinto beans, onions and cheese so people could mix and match with the chili base.  It was good and everyone enjoyed it.

I followed this recipe to the T.  I thought it was a little bland.  I re-read some of the reviews, are we sure we are talking about this recipe?  When You change or add something, you change it.  It becomes something different.  I am still looking for that perfect chili. Sorry George.

This chili is great!!  I made a big batch and kept some of it in the freezer.  When I need another bowl I just reheat it and its good to go.  Goes great with a hard/dry bread like sourdough.

This was a perfectly easy and yummy chili! I loved the heat and it makes for great leftovers too! The only thing I did differently was delete the green peppers- we're not fans of them in my house- but everything else I followed exactly and it was great.

I vary it by using different canned beans and I add mixed frozen veggies(corn, carrots, peas) for color. LOVE IT!

This recipe is fantastic. My girlfriend doesn't like mushrooms, so I omitted them, and I'm not a fan of pinto beans, so I doubled the kidney beans instead. I also added a couple splashes of tabasco sauce, but I don't think it made a difference. It's just the two of us, so we had leftovers for two days, and we never got tired of eating it!

This has been a repeat recipe FOR SURE!! I did make a few changes just based on my personal taste.  I used ground lean turkey (not drained).  I added a can on black beans (drained).  I also added a small can of Ortega brand chopped green chilies instead of the bell pepper.  When I was visiting my parents in Texas I used fresh chilies from the garden.  Crock-pot cooked it for 1 hour on high and then 5 hours on low!!! Topped it with cheese and onions-YUMMY!!!!

My family loved it.  It was thick and hearty perfect for a Minnesota cold night.  I had to make some changes because I was out of a few ingredients. So forgive me from deviating from the original recipe. 
I used 1 can of Great Northern beans, 2 pints stewed tomatoes with onions and peppers and 1 pt. tomato juice. I also threw in some red pepper flakes because I was out of cayenne. I put it in the crockpot to simmer all day.

This was good chili if you are after the "run of the mill" chili.  I could have used a little more flavor, but the flavor that was there definitely said "chili".  Thanks for this one!

This is super yummy and pretty easy for a first time chili maker.  I was afraid it would not be hot enough, so I used one pound of ground hot italian sausage and one pound of hamburger meat.  I also added a few pinches of red pepper flakes.  I used a crock pot, it turned out AWESOME!

Great simple recipe.  My entire family loved it even my four year old son.  The only thing I did a little different was to set aside 1/3 of the spices until 15 minutes before eating it to give it a little more zip.

Very good. Followed the recipe exactly as written. I know if seems weird to add the Tomato Juice, but it really does work and produces a great flavor. I sauteed the meat first then added everything to the crock pot.

I'm going to keep looking for a chili recipe.  I made this just as directed and tasted it and it was terribly bland.  I let my mother taste it, and she concluded that it was kind of "blah" as well.  I added a dash of everything in my spice rack, about 1/4 cup of ketchup, a few tbsp. of A1 sauce, some Tobasco and Worctershire (spelling?)to try to give it some flavor and that seemed to work, as my father said it was "pretty good."

This is a really good basic chili!  just the right level of spice for us!  Next time I think I'll take the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and substitute canned tomatoes for the tomato juice in an attempt to thicken it a bit.

My family loved this recipe including me and I am not a huge chili fan.  The only thing I did not add was the tomato juice because it was not put on my grocery list. Therefore, I opted to reduce the chili powder.  Add it turned out DELICIOUS!!!!  Next time I will add the juice and try it out.

I am not a great chili fan but, occassionally, when winter sets in, I'm compelled to make chili for my family, but I am often disappointed in the taste. Not this time. I didn't change a thing though, in the future, I might use a little less tomato juice; it does tend to thicken a bit. We eat it over rice, with a dollop of sour cream and grated cheddar cheese. Yum! Yum! My family, including my 3 year-old-granddaughter, enjoyed it. It's a keeper, "by George!"

It was pretty good and very easy. I used ground venison, more green pepper than called for, and one can "chili-ready" tomatoes and one can diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of tomato juice/paste. Thanks George!

I wish I could give 4.5 stars, but this isn't quite a 5.  I made a variation on this recipe with mostly dried ingredients, and stored it on the shelf for a week before my husband cooked it.  I used about 12 oz. dried kidney beans and 12 oz. dried pinto beans, and replaced the onion with dehydrated onion.  Then I left my husband instructions to brown 2 lbs. ground beef and then add the pre-mixed dry ingredients, the tomato sauce, and some water in the crockpot and simmer all day.  

We ended up using 3 cups of water but should have used a little more - maybe 5 cups?  The beans were a little too firm even after hours of cooking, and I think it was because the chili got a bit dry during cooking.  It didn't really take away from the flavor, though, or hurt the rating I gave.

The only reason I want to give this recipe less than 5 stars is because it had absolutely no heat, which made is seem a little bland (even though I quadrupled the cayenne).  This is a great recipe for a family meal precisely because of that blandness and lack of heat - my 19 month toddlers loved it with cheddar cheese sprinkled on it- but I wouldn't serve it if adult company was coming without adding hot sauce, more cayenne, and some jalepeno and maybe doubling the other spices.  

This recipe is definitely going to be a regular for our family.  It took so little time to prep, and I will be able to make 3 or 4 batches of the dry ingredients at a time and then just store them in our pantry.

Was a bit wet, so I "filled" it with a few handfuls of Barley.  Very tasty.  4 stars for the wetness of it, but the flavor was great.

This was very good chili! I omitted the green peppers, only because our family does not enjoy them. I also didn't have any cumin on hand, although I think it would've been nice to have that for extra heat. I cut this recipe in half and seem to have plenty for 3 people. 
Will definitely be making this again and freezing some.

This is an awesome recipe. I make this chili all the time, friends and family love it. I do make one change, I use two 28 oz cans of diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice. I also add one can of corn.

I made this for my husband to take into work.  Everybody said it was very good.  Made it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  I used 3lbs ground beef and added more tomato juice.  I followed some other reviews and used one can crushed tomatoes in place of some of the tomato juice, did not seem to soupy so will probably make with all tomato juice next time.  Also added one can of black beans.  I used chipolte chili powder in place of the cayenne so it definetly would not be to spicy, from what I tasted did not seem overly spicy so will use the cayenne pepper next time.  I also always use a six pepper blend in place of black pepper. Reading the recipe now I also see I forgot the cumin.  I also added some minced garlic since my husband and I like garlic.

This was very good... a little on the bland side. Could use a little kick. Followed the recipe exactly.

This is a fantastic chili recipe!  This is the first time I have ever made chili and it was so easy to make.  Even my fussy six year old son loved it!  Now that's fantastic!!

Thank you for a great recipe George!  It’s our favorite chili. Incorporated a few suggestions from reviewers: fresh cilantro (had some in fridge about two days away from getting slimy so was happy to read that review!), fresh garlic and a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. It’s wonderful!

This was tasty. I didn't use the tom. juice but used diced tom. and more tom. sauce and actually added some tom. paste and water to it. It was good and flavorful. And easy. Oh, and didn't add near as much chili powder as called for. I am not a spicy lover. I'm a wuss when it comes to hot/spicy food.

Excellent chili!  I used canned chopped tomatoes rather than tomato juice, I added red bell pepper and I used the crock pot.  I got rave reviews from the whole family.

This is the best chili I've ever made.  As per other's suggestions, I reduced the amount of tomato juice (by about half) and added a can of chopped tomatoes and it is still a little on the soupy side.  Probably will reduce the juice to about 1/4 next time and use two cans of chopped tomatoes.  Other than that change and omiting the onion and substituting navy beans for the kidney beans because of personal preferrence, (I substituted onion powder) I didn't change a thing and it's wonderful!  Great for a cold day

Pretty good chili.  I added a few pickled Jalapeno Pepper Slices for kick, substituted Diced Tomatoes in place of the Tomato Juice (I like chunky chili).  I also used Chipotle Chili Powder to give it a smokey flavor. You might want to saute the onions with the ground beef to make sure the onions cook through.

Great Recipe, I've been looking for an easy recipe. I omitted the Cayenne Pepper because I have small children.

I put this in the slow cooker Saturday night, turned it off in the morning and put it in the fridge until dinner as chili always seems to be better the second day. It was great, I will be making this again!

This recipe gets passed around a lot by my friends so I decided to try it.  I wish I'd read a few of the reviews before I made it.  It was WAY too soupy.  Compared to the chili's I have made in the past, my husband said this one is not at the top of the list because of how soupy it was.  I think next time I'll skip or reduce the juice in favor of stewed or chopped tomatoes.

I have made this twice with great reviews from my family (including picky kids) and friends. I didn't have tomato juice so I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 16 oz. of tomato sauce. I also substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of rotel tomatoes for the 29 oz. of tomato sauce. Cheese, sour cream and frito chips made it a hit!

This was excellent! I didn't change anything except to use canned chopped tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I made this for a huge crowd at my house for halloween, with white rice and a "chili Bar" of onions, shredded cheese, sliced jalapenos, black olives, sour cream, oyster crackers & fritos as choices for toppings. YUM! This is my new recipe for chili!!

This is such a great recipe.  I ended up using low-sodium V-8 for the tomato juice, and spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce, and it turned out incredible!  The first time I made this was for my family and I cut out the cayenne - my 2 year old gobbled it up (along with the rest of us.)  The second time I made it was for a Halloween party - I went ahead and used the cayenne and the neighbors grade schoolers said it was too spicy for them.  The older kids and adults polished off the 2 pots that I made.  Love this recipe for cool fall evenings!

I made this yesterday, I had it in the Crockpot all day while I was at work, And It was GREAT!!! My Dh loved it, And I brought it to work, and gave some to a co-worker, who said it was fantastic, really good. I did use 2 cans of diced tomatoes though instead of tomato juice. I am so happy I have my own from scratch Chilli recipe now!

Made this last night.  A big hit w/ everyone.  I added spicy V8, instead of regular tomatoe juice.  Next time I will throw in a jalepeno.  I'm partial to spicy food.  I also saute the onions with the beef.

One of the best chili recipes I have come across. Made a few changes. Used 1 lb lean ground beef & 1 lb ground turkey. I omitted the tomato juice. I didn't like the idea of soupy chili.I also left out the green pepper. I added two cans of Rotell tomatoes and one jalapeno cut up. I like my food spicey and this turned out great!

Very good chili recipe.  I used V-8, chopped tomatoes and a can of Rotel only because that's what I had on hand.  I omitted the red pepper because the Rotel has just enough heat for my family.  I'll be rotating this recipe throughout the cooler months.  Thank you for sharing.

Really good easy chili.  The only difference is I used diced tomatoes as I just like the way it thickens it.  Other than that everyone really liked this alot.

This is a great Chili recipe, thanks George! I hate when people say they 'love' a recipe and then tell you how they completely changed it and I don't want to be one of those people...BUT...I did add a can of Rotell...and it was really good!

Delicious! This is a great base chili. I tweak it a bit by substituting 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce. I use V8 in lieu of the tomato juice and I think that it adds a great flavor. I also use only 1.5 lbs of ground beef and 1 can each of light and dark kidney beans. I would add a little more kick to it, but I make it for the family and they like it as is.

This came out really good.  I ended up adding an extra can of kidney beans and substituting some of the tomato juice for a can of diced tomatoes.  I also used a Chipotle Chili pepper, as apposed to the Cayenne.  It was great, next time i think it could us a little bit more spice!

Good chili & soupy. Kinda thought it would be thicker after it "cooked down"  but it still was tasty.

Bottom line up front: this is a good recipe if you like your chili soupy. I gave this recipe four instead of five stars mainly because it was too soupy for us before I modified it. Maybe it's a personal preference thing, but we like our chili to be more like stew. I made it in a crock pot after browning the meat, but I don't know if that had anything to do with the soupiness. Anyway, I ended up adding some bulk with a 14.5-oz. jar of diced tomatoes (drained) and two cups (before cooking) macaroni, prepared in a separate pot. Also, since I was working out of a rather limited kitchen, I didn't have all of the required spices. Instead of going to the extra expense of buying them separately, I bought two packages of McCormick's chili seasoning mix, one "original" and one mild (we don't really like a "hot" chili). I still added salt, though I omitted the sugar. I thought the end product came out really well. I will make this again, but next time I'll cut the tomato juice down by at least half to avoid the soup factor.

Really good just as written!  I am happy to get rid of my old chili recipe for this one.  We like our food spicy, so I didn't find the  chili powder overpowering.  I made it in my slow cooker too, but made sure to decrease the liquid ingredients.  Great stuff!

We loved this chili! My husband asked me to make chili for the football game since his buddys were comming over. I chose this one based on the reviews, and I'm glad I did. I did add some garlic and more beans, but otherwise it was perfect. Soupy is the way we like it, that way we can load it with crackers!!

I thought this was a great recipe for basic chili.  I like a little more seasoning in mine so I added 1/2 a pkg of ranch mix.  I also used kidney and black beans.  Turned out perfect.  I will be using this a lot.

I used only the seasonings from this recipe to make my chili with things I had on hand and it came out really well - I think it's spiced perfectly and I'll write these seasonings into my own chili recipe to use every time I make chili in the crockpot!

This has become our standard quick weeknight chili.  I omit the bell pepper and I also saute the onion before I add it to the rest of the ingredients.

This Chili is HEAVENLY. The only thing I do differently is substitute diced fresh jalepenos for the green bell peppers, since I like my food SPICY.  My husband and I eat this chili a lot, it is the best recipe I have found yet.

I don't usually eat chili but this recipe is fantastic. Everyone in the house, including two picky 13 year olds, love this chili. I also used diced canned tomatos instead of just tomato juice and the consistancy was perfect.

This was delicious recipe.  I had a 4 oz. tomato sauce and I substituted some ketchup and water for the tomato sauce.  My daughter also thought is was very good.

I liked this but noticed someone said they thought it was "missing something" To my taste, it is missing beans. I am going to halve the ground beef and double the beans next time. 

I served it with grated swiss cheese on top. Yummy! But look out, we all overate; there were 5 of us and we nearly finished the pot.

I was never a big chili eater, but my husband and I love this recipe. I used stewed tomotoes and a jar of homemade pureed tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. It freezes great!

This chili was one of the best I have ever tried.  I cooked it on the stove, and let it cook an extra hour. I added stewed tomato's, garlic, and extra beans.  I will definitely make this chili again.

By far the best chili I've had...ever! I like to add another can of kidney beans and a little more chili pepper for spice. I use crushed tomatoes in place of the juice and it works perfectly.

This is a great recipe that you change slightly to you liking. I use ground turkey and also use cans of diced tomato with pepper and onion. Today I added some cilantro to it and as always, the recipee gets 5 stars!  My husband, who never liked chili, now gets excited when I tell him I am making "Chili by George". Thanks, George!!

I made it in a crock pot and I did not add the green peppers, but this was amazing chili!  A couple of my roomates, who claim to not like chili even had a bowl.  I might try adding some small chunks of tomato next time just for kicks.

Oustanding, great with cornbread on a rainy day. I just added a little tri tip to the dish that gave the dish a little more hearty-ness.

Okay, I'm done looking for Chili recipes because this is the best.  I tweaked the recipe a little after reading reviews...I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. sausage, and substited canned diced tomatos for some of the tomato sauce.  I really loved the tomato juice in it and I definitely thought it was spicy enough! Delicious!  Thanks, George!

This is a very easy chili to make and the flavor is great. My husband isn't a fan of spicy so you may want to cut out the cayene pepper if you want a milder chili. This has become my staple chili recipe.

I've tried this recipe twice and both times it was very bland. I closely followed the recipe, but my family and I are not fans of this one. It is better if you add some hot sauce, garlic, and garlic salt, but it still seems to be lacking something.Maybe too much tomato.

Great chili! Followed the instructions pretty much to a "T." The only thing I may add next time is some stewed tomatoes. UPDATE: I have recently become a vegetarian so I made this again only with boca soy crumbles. So good! You couldn't even tell it wasn't real beef. Oh and the fat was cut by about 2/3!

Great tasting chili!  My family and I have a tradition of having chili on Christmas Eve and rather than have my mom cook it like she always does I thought I would try making it myself.  I'm glad I did, bless my mom's heart but this one is much better than hers!  I did do a few variations of my own as many others did.  I first added 2 more cans of beans than the recipe called for.  I also added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  My family isn't too hip on anything real spicy so I cut back on the chilipowder (using only half the amount) and the cayenne pepper.  All in all it was a great batch of chili.  Will make it again very soon!

This was my first time making homemade chili and from the rating of my family, it gets 5 stars!  I didn't have tomato juice, so I substituted three 11 ounce cans of V8 and omitted the cayenne, because I also didn't have any.  It was still awesome.  My son ate it with Frito's Scoops and I am making a pan of cornbread to eat it with dinner.  Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe!!

This is the best chili my husband and I have ever had.  We used 1 lb. ground turkey and 1 lb. spicy sasuage in place of the 2 lbs. ground beef.  Delicious!!

My first attempt at chili was a great success thanks to this recipe. It tastes so good you would think it would be difficult to make, but that's not the case at all. My family loved it and received lots of compliments from the in-laws as well.

Loved it! I made some changes though. Instead of the 29oz can of tomato sauce, I used 3 (8oz) cans. I also used 1 can of hot chili beans, 2 reg chili beans, and 1 can of black beans. Omitted green peppers b/c nobody eats them here & the chili powder since I used chili beans. Served with cornbread!

AWESOME!!! I made mine in the crock pot.
But I made a few changes. I used my leftover turkey from Thanksgiving; added one extra can of beans (pintos); i substituted 16 oz. of tomato sauce with Hunts Chili sauce and the remaining sauce i just used plain. I added some crushed red pepper also.
I would use LESS sauce if you like it more chunky than soupy.

Really good.  I made a few changes though based on what I had on hand.  I used chili beans in sauce rather than the pinto and kidney beans.  Also didn't have cayenne so I used a little white pepper and some crushed red pepper flakes.  Still gave it a kick.  Definitely will use again.

Great chili! All I ended up adding extra, was a can of refried beans to make it a little thicker.

Amazing Chili!!  This was my first time to make chili from scratch. I changed the recipe a bit however.  I didn't use the tomato sauce and I only used about 8oz of tomato sauce.  I also used two cans of tamato paste (the small cans)and added water.  I also used 1 can of stewed tomatoes. I also added 3 cloves of garlic and I used red, white, and sweet onions.  I changed the recipe a bit but the base was great.  Oh yeah--I only used about half the chili powder and I cooked the onions with the hamburger meat.

I chose this recipe because it had only a few simple ingredients, which I think is essential for good chili.  However, I didn't think the chili would have enough kick without adding a few things, so we tossed in three diced serrano chilis and some crushed red pepper flakes.  The chili turned out great with a perfect blend of smoky spice.  Excellent recipe!

I cooked in the crock pot for 10 hours. Very good except for a bit to thin. Next time I will add tomato paste to thicken it up.

my only complaint about this chili is that there isn't much of a kick.  the texture is great, but it could use a bit of oomph.  perhaps a few more spices.  Will try again with some adjustments

This was my first attempt at chili and with a slow cooker.  It was a hit!!!  I made it just as it, but made 1 or 2 changes.  First, I added a little bit more of each "spicy" spice and it gave it a nice kick - just perfect.  Second I put in more beef.  I let it cook for about 10-11 hours and the beef turned more to hash and I like my chili chunky.  so, I quicky cooked up another 3/4 lbs of beef on the stove and added it about 1 hour before serving and man was it perfect!  I served it with sour cream, cheese and fresh made corn bread and my roommates are begging me to make it again!!!!

This was sooooo good! I didn't want to get full because it was too good to stop eating. I added about three cloves of garlic and instead of tomato sauce, I added three cans of diced tomatoes (not drained). I also didn't drain and rinse the beans so it thickened it up a bit more. I wish I had one more can of kidney beans though. Very, very yummy!

This was my first try at chili, and it turned out really well.  I added crushed red peppers and a little garlic powder, but didn't add the beans.  I ended up not having enough ground beef, so I put it on top of some egg noodles.  My boyfriend (the chili lover) thought it was great!  :)

I serve this over macaroni with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. It's delicious every time and freezes perfectly. Can be reheated and taste just as good a month later. 
I thicken it up toward the end of the cooking time with a mix of cornstarch and cold water.

Great recipe! Reading the other reviews, obvisously you can change it up to suit your personal taste and it still comes out great.  I only had dry kidney beans so softened those in salted water and used them.  I also seasoned the beef while browing as I used low sodium V8 Juice.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I worried about the consistency after reading the other reviews but using juice did not cause an issue.  I did cook with the lid ajar and used the full 90 minutes cook time to get the chili consistency. My guests had 2 & 3 helpings!!  Thanks for this one.

This was a great recipe!  My husband and I seldom have a taste for chili because so many of the chili recipe's I've tried were just "ok".  This is one is just perfect!  I also substituted the diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice.  The consistency is perfect.  Thanks George!

Made a few changes but overall good recipe. Scaled recipe in half. Used chuck steak instead of hamburger which turned out great because it was so tender! Also used (1) can of chili tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and (1) can of Brooks chili beans. This blew the roof off of most who ate it but we still loved it!

I grew up with two different types of chili. My moms, which I never liked and my grandpa's, which I loved. This recipe isn't exactly grandpa's, but its close and I am sure he would of loved it. Thanks for recipe, its a keeper.

Excellent!  Simple, easy to make, and flavorful make this recipe a five star in my book.  Like other reviewers, I substituted two cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato juice.  Put it all in the crock pot on high for four hours and served it on hot dogs. Wah-lah! Amazing chili dogs!  Thanks George!

Great basic recipe.  I was out of tomato sauce--so I used enchilada sauce instead--also added 1 can of corn at the end and used kidney/black/pinto bean combo.  Great recipe to add to, or I am sure it would be delish as is.

Great chili!  Made a few changes - used three cans diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice and sauce.  Left out the green pepper (personal preference) and used HOT chili powder.  Came out perfect after simmering in the crockpot on low all day.  Nice and spicy!!

My family loves this chili; they always request chili for dinner now.  I substitute the tom. juice with V8 and added extra cayenne pepper for more heat.  It's also good on loaded nachos.

I do not eat chili so I made this for my husband because he loves chili.  (I'm secretly trying to outdo his grandmother's prized chili!)  He liked it, but it wasn't anything special.  I had a lot left over.  He said it was way too "tomatoey".  He thought it might be better with a can of baked beans thrown in.

This was a great recipe if you have had difficulty making good chili.  It's great tasting, but not the best I've ever made or had. I will be using this recipe though as a base to make my chili from now on.

I doubled this recipe for a cookout, and slow cooked it all day before serving.  I subbed brown sugar for white, added a some tomatoes with green chilis and stewed tomatoes, and excluded the pinto beans.  There weren't ANY leftovers!

Great chili.  Has a little kick, so my 3 year old thought it was too spicy.  Just added lots of sour cream and cheddar cheese.  Our older kids really enjoyed this.  I scaled this recipe for 15 servings for 9 of us 7 of which were kids and it was gone the next day.  Only changes I made, cut back on the tomato juice and added a can of diced tomatoes.

I followed the other reviews and I used 3 15-ounce cans of diced and stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, and added a can of spicy V-8. I put it all in my crock-pot. It had the perfect consistency and was so delicious. Thank you for sharing! This will from now on be my "go-to" chili recipe.

Yummy! This is a classic chili recipe. I made it in the crock pot and it was very tasty. I added diced tomato in sauce and used about half of the recommended tomato juice.

I originally reviewed this in 2006, and it's still my go-to recipe for chili!

Great recipe! I cooked the beef the night before and popped the ingredients in the slow cooker yesterday before leaving for work.  What a great supper!  I kept most everything the same, just left out the pinto beans and added a little more spice.  Garnished it with Jack cheese, nacho chips, and sour cream and we were ready to eat!  This is definitely the quickest and easiest chili I have ever made.  Will be making on a regular basis.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I used leftover grilled sausage sliced really thin for the meat and only used 1/8 cup chili powder,...just in case.  I followed the advice of substituting canned diced tomatoes for the tomato juice--good call.  Sprinkled it with sharp cheddar,  and loved it this morning for breakfast as well!

This was an excellent recipe for Chili.  I have been making my mother-in-laws recipe for years so I thought I would try something new.  I added canned diced tomatoes and a little more suger than suggested; otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  My family does not like things too spicey, and this recipe had a bite to it.  I would use less cayanne pepper and chili powder next time.

This was delicious!!!  I also used some diced tomatoes as suggested in another review and added just a little less chili powder but added real chili peppers.   This recipe is defiantly a keeper!!  Thanks George.

What can I say but this is great chili. I followed the recipe and it turned out great. The next day the chili is even better. The spices has had a chance to meld together and the chili is Great on the second day. Thanks for the recipe. Can't wait until the next real cold day.

Chili was excellent.  Although I like things very spicy so I added a 1/2 jar of diced jalapenos and a little extra red pepper.  Also used part V8 in place of some of the tomato juice since I ran out of tomato juice.  Consistency of chili was excellent - definite crowd pleaser.

I made this for the superbowl and everyone loved it.  I listened to other reviewers and skipped the tomato juice and just added stewed tomatos in their own juice. It was great.  It really is even better the next day!

I couldn't imagine making Chili any other way! I added a lot more Cayenne Pepper to it and used "Garam Masala" seasoning (mix of coriander, blk pepper, cumin & cinnamon). It really gives it some spice. Thanks George!

I had looked at 4 different recipes and was going to use the spices from the others if I thought it needed it but it turned out perfect. Now I'm in Mexico and I had to use pinto beans only, chopped tomatoes from a box and fried tomatoes and it was great!

As other reviewers stated, I used V-8 juice instead of tomato and puree'd tomatoes instead of sauce.  That could have been my downfall.  Plus I used the crockpot.  It did seem a bit thin and the spices immediately upset my stomach.  Since DH didn't finish his bowl and DS16 didn't want any, I don't think I'll try it again.  Sorry.....

I've tried several chili recipies, but this one has been the best. I added 1/2 a jalapeno pepper for an added kick. But it didn't need it. It was perfect and everybody loved it.

I didn't use the suggested amount of chili powder and I added more salt plus 2 Tbp of brown sugar. Everyone gobbled it up and told me how delicious it was. Definate keeper!!!

EXCELLENT.  I hadn't ever made chili before and no one believed me when they tasted this.  It tastes like a recipe perfected after years of making chili.

This recipe is soooo gooooood and so easy. I add black beans instead of pinto and love the flavor from it. Instead of the tomato juice I add 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Thanks for this great recipe.

Awesome recipe George!  I made it this morning in the crock pot.  I served it on whole wheat pasta.  Unlike other, I didn't change a thing.  With a the last name Couch, how could you go wrong!

This is a great chili!  The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 cup of V8 juice, other than that I left it alone.  Very good, I will make it many more times.

I do like this, but I found it way too spicy for me, next time I will cut out the cayanne and will reduce the chili powder. I also took the others advice and used the can of diced tomatoes instead of tomatoe juice, and it made a good consistency.

Great recipe! I had a rough idea how to make chili but this really helped me out. I put a few twists in though. I used stewed tomatoes chili style instead of the juice and sauce, added a yellow pepper, and some brown mushrooms. Oh ya I used ground deer and also put some moose sausage in to. My roommates love it so far! The recipe has great spice also.

Thanks George, this is fantastic! I must admit though I altered the recipe a tad bit as I didn't have any tomato juice (and yes, I was too lazy to go get any) so I used one can (12) of tomato paste and made up the difference with water (2 cups). My British wife has only had the slaughtered foreign version of Chili and I couldn't stop her from eating this! And as a side note, as one reviewer states, don't rate this 1 Star if by the time you make your modifications there is nothing but a shadow of the recipe left. Thanks again George!

This was delicious!  I too chickened out and used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and made up the rest of the 46 oz using tomatoe juice.  I may try using more tomatoe juice next time, but I found it to be a good consistency with the crushed tomatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't care for it too much the 1/4 cup of chili powder drowns all the other flavors.  Adding pasta to it, made it a little more tolerable

This chili is great! You helped me to take it off my "can't cook that" list! I could never make good chili and now I make great chili! THANKS!  My store was out of pinto beans, so I used another can of kidney beans.  Also, like another reviewer suggested I cooked my onions and green pepper with the ground beef.  One thing I have to say is that it is a little more "sloppy" than I like, but I fixed that by adding a third can of kidney beans and I didn't add half of the tomato sauce.  Otherwise it would have been way too much sauce and not enough meat.  Next time I make it I will add more meat.  The spices are perfect! I wouldn't touch them! In fact, it is a great chili seasoning pack! I might just mix all the spices together and save them in ziploc bags for future use (or give them to family and friends) along with this recipe! THANKS for a great recipe and for helping me to make chili once and for all!

This was awesome.  I've always just made chili using the chili seasoning packet and putting in some beans too.  My husband said it was the best chili he's had.  I did add a can of black beans too because we love beans.

It is really good!!  Everybody liked even my 2 year old daughter.  If you like spice then add more cayenne.  The amount suggested was perfect for our family.  I also agree that it is a great starter chili.

I won our community Chili Cook Off for our wrestling team with this recipe! I  sauted the onion and peppers in the skillet where I had browned the beef. I bought really good quality ground meat and seared it in a very hot skillet. I didn't have any oregano or cumin. Iadded some bbq rib seasoning I had on hand that had a lot of cumin it. Thanks for sharing your recipe George!

This turned out great!! I didn't have any tomato juice or sauce so I just used one can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes. I substituted one can of pork & beans instead of kidney and pinto beans. I also added one can of mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again!!! Thanx George!

Oh My Goodness!  This recipe was awesome.  I just made it yesterday and it came out perfect.  However, I had my husband go to the grocery store to get a few ingredients that I needed and he of the 3 I had asked him to get he forgot 2.  It still came out good though.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I prepared this chili exactly as directed by the recipe. I had read some reviews stating that the chili was bland and was very surprised that I found it to be too hot. It was so hot that at first I thought that I had made a mistake and added too much cayenne or chili powder.

However, I hadn’t yet cleaned up the kitchen and had left all the ingredients and measuring cups and spoons out. When going back through my steps I found that I had followed the recipe exactly with no mistakes as to the quantity of any ingredient. 

The consistency and color of this chili was very good. Very similar to that of chili found at restaurants noted for their chili. However, this chili seemed to have heat without the flavor of most good chili. It seemed to be missing something or perhaps simply had too much chili powder for my liking. 

I plan on making this chili again but the next time will add the chili powder a bit at a time then sample for heat and flavor. Seems that once you get the chili powder in the pot you can’t take it back out!

I was testing recipe's for a Party I am throwing next week.  This Recipe is a 5 star because everyone liked it.  Everyone I reviewed had something different they like about chili - maybe more this or more that but overall their comments stated that they liked the Chilie and I am not changing it. A little more of something, just gives someone else reason to complain. We will be serving it in bread bowls and I know it will be a hit.

This chili is great! A friend made it for my boyfriend, who doesn't like chili, yet he ate four helpings of it!  I loved it because it did not have a strong chili taste or a lot of grease!  A top choice!

I'm not a huge fan of chili, but my husband is.  We tried this and he raved about how great it was, and I even had two bowls myself!  This is a fantastic recipe...even the leftovers are already gone!!!

This chili was just perfect for me. I cooked it in the slow cooker while I was at work.  It was so nice and yummy to come home too.  It made great lunches for the next few days too!

I made this without the peppers and onions.  It was delicious!!!  Spicy, but not too spicy.  Perfect with hot dogs.  The whole party enjoyed it!

This was fantastic!!! Unlike most people who reviewed this I actually used tomato juice like the recipe said and it sooooo good. The only changes were that I used pinto beans with jalapenos and I browned the beef with the onions. I put everything in the crockpot and my friends raved about how good this chili was. This is the chili I will be cooking from now on. Thanks George for this awesome recipe.

I enjoyed this chili, but I did make some changes.  I omitted the beans and the tomato juice and added some diced tomatoes. Also, I cooked the onion with the meat. I think this is a good chili recipe to start with, and then you can keep adjusting it to your tastes. I know I want it spicier.

This is delicious. My changes were to use diced tomatoes in their own juice instead of the tomato juice and I threw in a little garlic. Served with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream with cornbread on the side. Thanks :-)

I used V8 instead of plain tomato juice - it had more zing!  And I added garlic and a can of chili flavored baked beans.  It was still a bit watery so I thickened it a bit with a slurry of cornstarch and water, BUT it was sooo good!  My husband and I had it for two nights, it made so much.  But there were no complaints!

Great recipe but requires a lot of tweaking. Instead of tomato juice, I used two cans of diced tomatoes flavored with garlic and onion. I also used pasta sauce (like Prego) instead of tomato sauce. I left out the pinto beans and just used two cans of the kidneys. I sautéed one diced onion, one green bell pepper, and some garlic in a little butter and olive oil. I then added the ground beef (although lean ground turkey works too). I added the meat mixture about 2 hours after the tomato mixture was in the crock-pot. I left out the cayenne, sugar, and oregano, but bumped up the pepper, cumin and chili powder (doesn't make it spicy). I added the spices to the meat mixture and the tomato mixture (for ample seasoning), then combined the two and let it slow cook in a crock-pot for 8 hours. Absolutely perfect...my version that is! :) Great base chili recipe, George!

A basic, good chili - I added some cajun seasoning and a different kind of bean (can't remember which kind).  My husband and I both liked it, even though the tomato sauce flavor doesn't truly go away.

At first, I only gave this recipe three stars, but I gave it one more because I think that the recipe is just not to my taste. It seems too much like canned chili to me. Good, just not great. I am going to keep looking for a chili recipe that suits me more. Thanks anyway!

This chili was quick, easy and very basic to make. I live in a small apartment buildling in Toronto, and people were salivating, smelling it simmering from the top floor to the streets! Personally, it was a little thick for my liking (though that makes it perfect for nacho dips) but my friends all died for it!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added the ground beef toward the end, and I left out the juice and added diced tomatoes. This pot of chili lasted less than 24 hours between 2 of us because we couldn't stop eating it!!

This is a fabulous basic chili recipe!  I had to make a couple of substitutions because I was short a couple of ingredients, but knowing cooking and how different items would have affected the taste, this is definitely a top notch recipe!!  We even used it the next day on chili dogs!

This is the PERFECT chili recipe!  My hubby was craving chili the other day so I made this recipe...I did follow another reviewers suggestion and added another can of tomato sauce. I also only added one can of beans, instead of two.  YUMYUM  Perfect with mustard and lots of cheese!!
Thanks George!

Very good chili recipe!  I left out the green pepper because I didn't have one but I didn't miss it.  I also used half the chili powder and it was plenty.  I'll be making this again.

Reading the other reviews, I did not put the tomato juice in, but put in another can of tomato sauce.  I've only used my slow cooker a few times, and although I believe it brought out the flavours considerably, I think the ground beef tastes better when it is not slow cooked.  Next time, I may add the cooked ground beef an hour before the end of cooking.

Nice recipe. What I like about it is that you can play around with the ingredients and it still comes out good. You can use white beans instead of kidney beans, add bayleaf or basil, use canned chopped tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato paste, tomato sauce...whatever you have in the kitchen. You can make it hot or a wee bit sweeter...a winning recipe for sure.

This chili was good, but definitely not on par with other 5-star slow cooker recipes. I would say that this provides a good "base" for a chili. If you add your own ingredients, you make it taste more lively. As the recipe stands, it lacks the punch a good chili needs.

Very good chili.   Just the right combination of meat, beans and spice.  I did make a couple of modifications. I sauted a whole onion, a green and a red bell pepper all chopped and then added them to the chili.   I let it cook about 2 hours on the stove.

Very, very, good. I was very impressed with this recipe. I will make this again soon. I cut back on the vegetable juice and it wasn't too soupy. I added lots of onions and garlic and extra cayenne pepper. We like it spicy so we added extra extra spices but it can be fixed to suit anyone's taste.

I had only one 8-oz can of tomato paste and no tomato juice, so I used the paste plus three cans of tomato sauce and it was perfect.  I love the way the seasoning came together.  Great recipe!  I'll definitely use again.

This Chili recipe was great! Everyone loved it. I did make some alterations. Added only half the amount of Juice and Sauce. Added 2 cans of tomato paste and an extra half pound of meat skipped the Cayan but used Tabasco sauce. I cooked it in the crockpot 8-10 hours.

This is a really good recipe, but I did make a couple of changes too.  We used 2 cans of just pinto beans instead of adding kidney beans and added 3 hot peppers instead of bell peppers,and 2 cans of stewed tomatoes in place of tomato juice.  We do like our chili to warm us up!! Will be making this a lot this winter.

This was pretty good. This was the first batch of chili I have cooked, I think with a little alterations (more spice, less tomato juice) this would be great!

This was delicious! I made a couple of changes based on the ingredients I had at home: I added one more can of beans, about 1/2 - 3/4 lb more of ground beef.. added 2 cloves of garlic, an extra few dashes of cayenne pepper, and I used one can of stewed tomatoes and the rest was jarred spaghetti sauce (it was all I had.) This was the first time I made chili that I loved!!! My husband loved it too!!
