Happy with the results. 
Only change is to Steam the eggs.  I have chickens and Fresh eggs can be difficult to peel.
Bring water to boil, add eggs to steamer, reduce heat to medium.  Steam 13 minutes, remove eggs to Ice Bath.  When cool enough to handle, peel.

Very good. First if you do not already cook hard boiled eggs this way you should. The advice and technique is spot on. Second I enjoy the teriyaki flavor with egg and this recipe does not fail. As a variation I might try mixing in some apple vinegar to pickle the eggs and add some more tang. Maybe add some ginger. I m getting excited with all the possibilities!

Delicious! I love this twist on the traditional pickled eggs. I only let them marinate for the 6 hours called for (I couldn't wait to try them lol) but I have the leftovers in the fridge and I can't wait to try them tomorrow as I know they will be even better! I will be making these often YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)

Great to have a few of the teriyaki eggs in the fridge for salads, egg salad or really impressive deviled eggs.  I've even been known to eat them right out of the fridge as a snack.  Great as a change from eating just plain eggs.  I cook 6-7 eggs in the instapot then quickly cool and peel the eggs.  Cook the soy sauce and other ingredients at the same time then put in the jar to cool with one or two ice cubes.  Put the peeled eggs in mixture right away then may add a little water to make sure eggs are covered in jar.  Quick and easy.  Have not tried to re-use marinade but expect might by OK.
