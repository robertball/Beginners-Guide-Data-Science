oh my!  This has got to be one of the best recipes I have ever tried on here.  To begin with, the vibrant colors of red, purple, fleshy orange, and green makes one want to dive right in.  The only changes I made were to double the red onion to half cup, and only used 2 tbsp. of EVOO, and added 2 seeded jalepenos.  The blend of flavors was magnificant.  To bite into that creaminess of the avocado, the bite of the pepper, the sweetness of the mango, and of course garlic and cilantro was to die for.  You will want to double this if you take it to a party because I made it just for my husband and myself to go with "Sizzling Chicken Fajitas" from this site, and I probably ate half of it on chips before the dinner was prepared.  I did use 4 roma tomatoes as stated in the recipe and it was perfect.  Just squeeze out the tomatoes before putting in so that it won't be soupy.  This would be a great salad by itself if cut into bigger pieces instead of dicing for salsa. If one is not a big garlic lover, I would cut down on the garlic.  I am a garlicholic and so for me, it sent me to heaven!  This takes salsa to a new level...absolutely a cut above the rest.

This salsa will have you eating it with a spoon! It is soooo good. It is best to make it the day you are going to use it because the avocado can get a little squishy after a day or two. I would recommend making a triple recipe...I do and I still run out!

I just had a party in my mouth! I made this on a whim, basically to use up odds and ends in the fridge that oddly enough were what was called for in this recipe.  I've never had this kind of salsa before so didn't know what to expect.  Man is this good!  Slightly sweet, slightly savory, slightly spicy with an explosion of flavor from the garlic, jalapeno and cilantro - and the creamy, mellow avocado brings it all together and balances it out.  After "sampling" a good portion of it, Hubs remarked that he didn't think he was going to like this but found it "strangely addictive."  I backed off on the cilantro by maybe half and that worked out well for us.  Other than that I followed the recipe and liked it just fine. This is  so colorful and festive it just beckons you to come and try it.  It tastes so good it makes you go back for more.

This was a very good salsa recipe.  We followed the recipe and it was a great way to use up some of the tomato crop from the garden.  Next time I would make sure to squeeze out more seeds from the tomatoes because a lot of liquid piled in the bottom of my salsa bowl.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it!

This salsa is awesome! I have brought it to two parties and it has been a huge hit at both. I doubled the recipe both times and it still went really fast...I highly recommend trying it out, you won't be dissapointed! I also left out the jalapeno because I didn't have any, but I didn't miss it at all.

Be sure to use a mango and avocado that are just slightly underripe or you'll have a squishy mess.  Made as directed, it is quite a mild salsa.  If you want heat you'll have to improvise.  Don't add the olive oil.  I don't see the point and it makes for slimy, oily leftovers.

This recipe was GREAT. However, the mango I bought was not ripe so that didn't even get added in, it was still outstanding. Can't wait to try with the mango.

Thank you FHIVESHOT! This is the best salsa I have ever had! I of course, add more mango because I love them, and use habanero instead of jalepenos because I just didn't taste much heat. I made this for a salsa contest during Cinco De Mayo and it got 2nd even though it obviously deserved first. I had to run out with it before they event was finished so I could have some for myself before it was totally devoured! If you like mangoes, avocados, salsa, or just food period, you will LOVE this salsa. No one who has tried it, has not loved it! Thanks again

Excellent. Made this in the summer with all fresh-picked ingredients.  Served the first day with tortilla chips. The next evening we served it room-temperature spooned on BBQ'd pork tenderloin.

This dip is just magical. Incredible blend of flavors. The mango added to the salsa is the absolute perfect touch. My husband begs me to make this when his friends come over. It doesn't last very long!

Excellent salsa, but make double or triple amount, and don't skimp on the jalapeno.  Worked very well with grilled pork, stir-fried shrimp, and with chips.  I found it keeps well if you soak the red onion in hot water for 10 mins before adding--takes the bite/stink out of the onion and keeps it from overpowering the salsa.

My friends and family request this often!  So delicious.  I usually make a double batch because it is gone as soon as I set it down on the counter.

Soooo soo good! I used a jar of organic sliced mangos in a light juice which came to about two cups of mango. 1 large organic vine tomato and 1 organic small tomato. 1 whole organic jalapeño pepper. 1/2  cup organic cilantro. 1/2 teaspoon organic minced garlic ( = about 1 clove) . 1/2 teaspoon salt. 2 tablespoons lime juice. 1/2 cup organic chopped red onion. 1 tablespoon olive oil. I let it sit in the fridge for about half and hour and then drained some of the juice out. Turned out really tasty and well balanced in flavor.

This is best if it is going to be consumed the day of making it because the avocado can get pretty icky after a day or two. Great flavors and one of my staples salsa recipes now. I leave the avocado out if I'm making batches to save and serve later.

Before i made this my boyfriend was a little skeptical about the mango, letting me know that it is very "potent"...but make a batch and took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it! Now i usually keep it in the fridge for snacking! I live in wyoming and we dont have a good selection of magos here so i used canned and it was still really good!

This is the first salsa I have ever made and it was great.  It makes a large amount but keeps well in the refridgerator.  The fresh jalepeno seeded does not make the salsa hot at all.   I will make this recipe ALOT Thanks

Absolutely outstanding.  All my friends LOVE this salsa, and we're from the Southwest where we get salsa in every variety.  Delicious as-is; I've also done it without onion or without cilantro (for those who are allergic) and it's every bit as good.  And very yummy on white fish, as recommended.  This one's a keeper!!

This was pretty darn good.  I substituted basil for the cilantro, and omitted the oil.  Next time, I think I'll add 1 more mango, because it still seemed like too many tomatoes in each bite, and I recommend taking the seeds out of the tomatoes because I didn't and ended up with a very watery salsa.

This is an excellent recipe!  However, 1 tsp salt is too much.  I find that 1/2 tsp is plenty without being overly salty.

I didn't think I'd like the blended flavors of Mango and tomato, but I made the recipe because a friend recommended it highly. It was fabulous! I served it over grilled Salmon with rice.

My husband tried this and ate it until he was too full to eat supper!  We loved it.  I put in 2 tbsp of oil instead of 3.  Make sure the avacado and mango are not too ripe because the recipe becomes mushy.  Tasty and addictive!!

This salsa is great!  I used 2 mangos and 2 avacados but the rest the same.  Will definately make it again.  Served with a jerk chicken from this site.

Excellent recipe. Didn't have tomatoes so used diced can tomatoes, drained. Chopped in leftovers of olives. We like spicy food so I also used black pepper and couple drops of Tabasco sauce. My boyfriend was really suspicious about this weird mix of ingredients but loved it. Served it over white fish, was also great on sandwich with turkey breast.

Very good! We had this tonight on pan-fried tilapia and my husband proclaimed it my best fish ever. I used much less tomato than called for -- only 1.5 Roma's -- because I didn't want to use up all my tomatoes, and it was just fine.

Awesome!  i made double.batch, what.a hit .  If you are planning on eating within 24 hours, this is perfect, if you let sit more, it really gets mushy.
I did take other readers advice and squeezed out the seeds and juices from the tomatoes. Will definately make again.  I would also suggest getting a mango that is on verge of being ripe or ripe, for best flavor to the salsa.

This salsa has Magical powers!  I tippled the recipe and still ran out!  The only things I will do next time are squeeze the tomatoes more to remove liquid, and add a tad bit less oil ( I think in tripling it they over did it on the oil conversion ). 

Best homemade salsa I've ever made!

Loved it!! Made it for my sons birthday partyfor the adults, I doubled the recipe and it was a hit!  the only changes I made were I roasted the jalapenos under the broiler and scraped the insides out and put them in that way.  Otherwise I wouldnt change anything! I will be making this again!

I have made this several times now and even my husband's co-workers were asking for the recipe.  I did use a can of diced tomatoes last time and it still tasted great!  I'm making and taking this to the U of A this weekend for my son and his friends in college.  He specifically requested it!

I thought it was quite good, but my husband couldn't get past the mango and my son couldn't get past the cilantro.  Easy to make and very pleasing to the eye and I am sure this would be perfect to bring to an event.

Excellent salsa and I've gotten many requests for the recipe.  I use only 2-3 tomatoes so as to have approx. the same quantity of tomato, mango and avocado.  I also use the zest of 1 lime along with its juice.

This was different, but good different. We used tortillas chips to scoop up the salsa. I won't make this again though. Your avocado can NOT be soft! It'll make the whole salsa mushy.

I hate disagreeing, and I really wanted to like this, but my DH and I found it too salty and with something of an overwhelming taste. However, my guests really enjoyed it, hence the 3 stars.

I got this recipe from you guys a year or two ago and it's a hit every time I make it for a church potluck or picnic!  Folks can't wait for the summer months when mangoes and avocados are in abundance!  Fresh jalapeños and lime juice really make it work!  (PLEASE -- even if you like it spicy -- DON'T use canned or jarred peppers; and remove the seeds and veins from the fresh peppers to give the salsa the jalapeño flavor, but not the heat.  Spicy heat just does not work with this particular recipe as it might with other salsas...

This was a hit!  I increased everything except the tomato (I didnt have enough) and I just drizzled a tiny bit of olive oil on - not sure why its needed, but I figured I'd add a bit as I love olive oil.  I loved it and even got some people that don't like mango to try and they liked it too :-)  I just made this again - kind of eyeballed my ingredients and tasted as I went, used white onion and added black beans and corn - I LOVE it!!!  Thanks for this recipe - it is among my all time favorite salsas!!

I went to the grocery store to buy the ingredients for this salsa, and found a container of fresh salsa in the produce section. It contained all of the same ingredients except olive oil, avocado and mango. I purchased one avocado and one mango and added them to the packaged salsa, along with some olive oil. It was a HUGE hit at my party, and I saved so much time chopping/buying all of the ingredients. This would not work with salsa in a jar - it has to be 100% fresh salsa with a short shelf life.

I thought this was absolutely amazing! Everyone who tasted this loved it. I did decrease the olive oil down to 1 1/2 Tbsp. I also decreased the garlic the second time I made it because it was a bit much.  I used less tomato because I wasn't sure how the flavors would go together,and I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes,  but it was delicious. I also added some fresh minced green chili's and extra lime juice and a bit of fesh cilantro. The fresh lime juice and cilantro make a huge difference. I make this at least once a week now!  Thank you for sharing!

I thought the idea of mango, avacado, onion and tomatos together was a really strange one. I made this anyway. I did make a few changes according to my family's tastes- left out the cilantro completly, used half of a large Anehiem pepper instead of the jalpeno (to cut the heat). This is wonderful.  My husband (notorious meat & potatos guy) just knew this was going to be another of my crazy ideas...until he had his first taste. Now he is wandering the kitchen trying to figure out something else he can put this on. I would make a single batch for 2-4 people, but I can see where a potluck or large gathering would need a 3x recipe. This would also be good on fish tacos. This will be a common addition to this summer's grilling.

This salsa is great! I literally have to make this every weekend in the summer time. Even people who aren't fans of certain ingredients such as avocado or cilantro love this salsa. I pretty much double the ingredients to make more and I like to add extra avocado because it makes it extra tasty and gives it that creaminess. Its great with chips, but also taste awesome on burgers or with grilled chicken as a salsa topping. All in all, this recipe is a must have and a crowd favorite!

Great!  A lot of work with all the chopping but everyone loves this when I bring it to parties/work.  My bf wants me to make it all the time.  Very refreshing and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I used 3 large tomatoes and omitted the cilantro simply because I forgot to pick it up and it was still really good... It tastes so good...especially with the sweetness of the mango! I wasn't sure how I'd like it since I am used to a more thin salsa...but this is amazing. Just LOVE it!

The BEST salsa I have EVER had, homemade or bought! We had this over tostadas with chicken and the flavors and textures from the fresh fruit were incredible.  This will now be a main staple in my kitchen.

This recipe is fantastic!!  I have people ask me for the recipe every time I make it.  However, you must use a good ripe mango and avocado, or don't bother making it.  If I make it during tomatoe season I add chopped tomatoes from my garden, as well, and the freshness of the ingredients make this an unbelievable salsa.  I omit the olive oil-the juice from the mango and tomatoes makes a nice texture and it seemed too oily when I made it the first time with the olive oil. If it's not spicy enough I add some hot sauce.  You can eat it with tortilla chips or use it as a topping for grilled chicken or fish-wonderful!

Delicious! I was a bit worried about the jalapenos being too strong, so I got milder peppers...but now I wish I would have gone with jalapenos! In any case, it's better after sitting in the fridge for a while. A great snack.

Fantastic Recipe!  I made it exactly per instructions and it turned out perfect, and I received multiple compliments.  I also have made it and omitted the avacado and it is excellent that way as well!  Definitely a keeper!

Great Salsa!  could have had a little more heat, next time i will add more jalapenos but this was a hit!  The teenagers were snubbing their nose at it while i was making it, but they tore it up when it was done!

Flavor explosion!  Wow!  I tasted it right after making it, and thought that it could be too hot, but after chilling it overnight, it was perfect.  I LOVE this salsa.  It's going on a girls weekend trip and will go well with our margaritas!

Fantastic!  I suggest searching for a video on how to peel and dice a mango.  Roasting and peeling the jalapeno added great flavor. Instead of garlic and onion I used shallot. And I only used about half the lime juice and olive oil.

Mango salsa has scared me for a while, the thought of such a sweet fruit in a salsa didn't seem quite right.  But my curiousity got the best of me and was SOOOO glad I tried this recipe.  All of the flavors blended so well together, even the kids loved it.  We ate this ontop of beer battered fish tacos and it was perfect.  I think we will be fighting for the leftovers today, haha, thanks so much for sharing.

This is soooooooo delicious, fresh and easy. Everyone asked me for the recipe! The only thing I changed is to cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon -- it was too salty for me with a full teaspoon.

I have had authentic mango salsa, and this recipe didn't top it.  It wasn't a bad salsa, just not as good as the other I've had.  I would add more mango or use less tomatoes if you want a lot of mango flavor.  This made a ton, and I think it was def more than 6 servings in my book.

Delicious and refreshing!  Didn't use any olive but used all other ingredients.  I don't know why you would add the olive oil.  Just more calories.

This was terrific! My husband said this was the BEST salsa EVEr as he busied himself with emptying the bowl, and said I must triple the recipe next time (there are only the two of us!)I followed the recipe exactly, even though I toyed with the idea of leaving out the cilantro, since I'm not a fan, but at the last minute I left it in...it wouldn't have been as good without it. Yum, Yum, Yum....fantastic!

I have made this so many times since the first time I made this, and I usually just use dried cilantro, but that last tiem I made it I followed the recipe and used fresh cilantro, and I must say with dried cilantro it is 5 stars, but with fresh it is off the charts!! I will only use fresh cilantro from now on. It is defintely a must.

This was the first Mango Salsa I have ever attempted and I must say it won't be the last.  We loved the flavor combo..very refreshing.  Next time I will add an extra mango and jalapeno and reduce the amount of cilantro and oil.  Loved munching on this with salty tortilla chips...so good.

This was excellent!!!  I originally made this to top some fish that we were having for dinner and my dh and I devoured it.  We ate the leftovers that night with chips.  The flavors meld together so well!  The second time I made it I couldn't get any fresh mango so I used canned and it tasted just as good!

I was so disappointed , the reviews were so good! I guess I could have done something wrong, (don't know what tho).I think you would really have to love Mangos to enjoy this!

I thought this salsa was pretty good. I tried it with and without the mango and both variations were good. Also, I left out the olive oil, as I don't care for "oily" salsa.

I've made this  few times now and everyone who tries it agrees it is fantastic.  A couple of adjustments: add a chopped papaya, half a can of black beans, half a can of corn, and I only use maybe a fourth of  chopped jalapeno because I'm a wimp, and this is the best salsa I've ever made.  Thanks for the post!

Delicious!  The favors blend together so well.  I agree with other reviewers when they say that you can eat this by itself.  But, this is also good with grilled chicken or fish.  The only thing I changed was that I used a Serrano chile instead of a jalapeño, but that is a personal preference of mine, and not a necessary change to the recipe.

This was amazing!  I served it on grilled chicken. I used the frozen cilantro cubes and garlic cubes (found at Trader Joe's and Costco).  I put extra cilantro and garlic in the recipe since I love those spices and I will add jalapenos next time and maybe serve it with fish or on fish tacos.

Perfect mango salsa!  Just the right ratio of the mango to tomato and avocado.  I paired this w/ pan fried Opah and a lemon butter cream sauce in an effort to replicate a restaurant dish i once had and this salsa was right on!!

No need to wait for a warm summer evening. This has officially become my favorite salsa. Made this for my super bowl party and everyone loved it. Some people modified by adding corn and/or beans but I wouldn't change a thing. The only modification I would make is to mix everything together well without the avocado, then mix in the avocado last since it tends to get mushed up in the process. Also don't think this is a salsa that can be thrown together in a food processor. The ingredients must be hand cut.

Very, very good. Just make sure your mangoes are ripe! We bought ours the day we made this, and they were not quite ripe, so I had to add sugar to the salsa in order to bring out the sweetness.

Very good!!!  The first day I served this over baby spinach and grilled fish!  I have been eating what is left with tortilla chips.  I left out the olive oil, (just seemed like added calories that were not needed), it is very fresh and delicious!!!

I brought this salsa to a Salsa contest we had at work. Eventhough I didn't win it was the first one gone and people were asking for more. I made it exactly the way it is in the recipe. It's delicious and it looks wonderful.

Tasty, but I think the proportions are just a little off.  There is too much tomato compared to mango and avocado in my opinion.  The flavor and colors are nice though.

Love this. 1st I made this, I did not add as much cilantro and it was great. (Not a big cilantro fan) This last time I added almost the amount that was called for. Liked it better the first time! Still good though!

Delicious! I added extra mango, doubled the avo and threw in about 1/2 cup fresh chopped pineapple. I also did not remove seeds from jalapeno...we like it spicy and I would have actually added another had I had one on hand. Finally, the shops were all sold out of cilantro so I had to omit it (very sad) and yet it still was delicious. Thanks!

This salsa is amazing. It doesn't last long! I cut down the olive oil to 2 Tbsp and I think it's plenty. I'll make this frequently.. thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe. I tried to modify this into more of a chopped salad than a salsa by tripling the mango, avocado, and tomato and getting rid of the seeds from the tomatoes. I cubed instead of diced everything too. Also, I let the garlic sit in an eight of a cup of EVOO, lime and cilantro for an hour to make more of an marinade.  I might try roasting the garlic the next time to get more flavor from it but the taste is great either way.  This would be a great chutney on chicken and fish as well.

Absolutely amazing!! I made bruschetta out of it by having the deli slice up tons of little bread slice (a whole bag for $1.99!) and put some olive oil on them and put them under the broiler. Best salsa I've ever had :)

Naples34102 put it best, "It's a party in your mouth!"  As mentioned by other reviewers, I juiced out the tomatoes, and actually only added three roma tomatoes instead of four.  Delicious combination of fresh produce, and perfect for a hot summer day!

Made this for a summer party and got rave reviews all around - even from my husband, who typically does not like anything with fruit mixed in it.  The flavors blend beautifully and the colors are gorgeous.  I only used 2 cloves of garlic and 3 tomatoes and it was just right.  Already have requests to make it again.  Huge hit!

This is the best recipe I have found on this site and I've found quite a few. We double the mango and avocado, add more lime juice and garlic too. But oh, is it good! We love it plain and so do our guests. It's also good with chicken and fish! Tonight we're having it on fish tacos. YUM. It's pretty labor intensive but we get our whole family involved and it's kind of fun. You will NOT regret making this. The only problem is to stop yourself from making it all the time!

Delicious salsa but my husband said it is not spicy so we added 1/2 tsp cayenne powder. I also sneak in 1/2 tsp vinegar. The rest I followed the TUNISIANSWIFE's suggestion. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!!

Very good fresh, chunky salsa.  I prefer mine a little spicer, but that is an easy fix.  Used it as a topping on some chicken soft tacos and it was great.

Very nice flavors.  It's that sweet and saltey with a little heat that I like. I also love that it is a healthy snack if served ith baked chips or Triscuits. I will for sure make this again as both my hubby and kids LOVED it.

This was a great hit at our Memorial Day Cookout!  The mango is so sweet but between that and the tomato/garlic/jalapeno/onion, the flavor of the avocado got lost in the shuffle.  I give this four stars because I found the five star salsa on this site: Grape and Avocado Salsa... totally different but totally avocado.  Enjoy!

This was yummy.  I loved the flavor.  Next time I may add more lime juice...Like the juice of two limes and may skip the avacado for some cucumber, just cause the avacado did get a littly mushy.  I also skipped the jalapeno and used half of an orange bell pepper instead.  It was quite good.

So yummy!! Great recipe that I will be making again. The only change i made was the cliantro. I used less than a 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. In my opinion if I had used the full amount of cliantro, it would have been too over powering.

A great salsa. I too removed the seeds from the tomatoes which helped reduce the liquid. I added 1 medium cucumber, seeded and diced. Folded in the avocado last. Delicious!

I made this for a party this past weekend. For those who like sweet, this is the salsa for you.My GF's loved it!  For those who like it a little spicier, I suggest adding about 1/2 to a full Tbsp of Sriacha or Chalula to kick up the fire. Also, I added some parsley and black pepper. I may also make the recipe again with either 1/2 the mango or no mango. The avocado served as a nice binding ingredient and made it buttery. This was great served with Stacey's Pita Chips (Multi Grain).

This was really good dip!  I wasn't paying much attention when I was making this so I crushed the garlic (2 cloves) instead of minced it, so it was too garlicky for my taste.  I think if I were to actually mince the garlic as the recipe states this would have been perfect.

I JUST finished making it for my Super Bowl party...made my 2 avocado, 4 tomato, and 1 mango dice a little bigger so it eats more like a salad.  (Like others, I also seeded my roma tomatoes so it won't get too soupy.)  I didn't want to bite into raw garlic or jalepenos so I used a little less than 1 tsp garlic powder and cayenne pepper each.  I seperately food processed the red onion and cilantro.  It hasn't even sat for the 30 mins to blend the flavors and I was already portioning out a plate for myself!  I can already tell you that this salad will be a regular for my husband and me!  Can't wait to share it with my friends!

Delish! Altho I can't imagine using that much cilantro, as I find it just too overpoweing.  I prefer fresh basil, maybe 2 tablespoons. Some reviews commented they liked the flavour after sitting overnight, but I'm the opposite, as I found the individual flavours got 'lost' after a few hours.  I mush prefer to eat it immediately.  Prep time for me was way off, does anyone else remove the seeds and pulp from tomatoes?  I also didn't blend but rather left it quite chunky, for the same reason of being able to enjoy the individual flavours.  Won't buy store bought again, unless I'm desparate!

Made this without the Jalapeno pepper and it is still a 5 Star recipe.  I serve it over fish and have served it with tortilla chips. Wish my hubby could tolerate a Jalapeno pepper!

This is absolutely delish!  My husband and kids loved it. I can't wait to make it for the next potluck.  I took some advice from other reviewers and only used 1 clove of garlic and I thought that was plenty. I also used less salt and only 1 Tbs. of oil.  Since we like heat I added extra jalapenos.  I didn't have an avocado but this was great even without... though I am anxious to try this with the avocado. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this salsa for a Bday party for my brother-in-law and it was a big hit.  I had never used a mango before and it was quite a feat for me to peel and dice.  Now that I know how to prepare a mango, it will take alot less time.  I used 2 mangos and 2 avocados.  Everything else remained the same.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Forget chips, I put this on EVERYTHING.  I don't think I've even tried it with tortilla chips yet.  I usually use this as "dressing" for a spinach salad or topped on a protein like pork or chicken.  I skip the olive oil all together.  In my opinion, it doesn't add a noticeable dynamic to the taste and there's 360 calories gone right there.  I usually double everything and use one ripe mango (the skin is reddish almost all over and comes off easily when peeling and the flesh is orange) and one almost ripe mango (the skin is half green/half reddish and comes off with a paring knife and the flesh is yellow).  I find this tempers the sweetness so it's not overpowering.

Thank you for this recipe. I won first place for a salsa contest we had at our church picnic. Hallelujah! It was my first time making salsa ever! I tripled the recipe and it ended up being a little too salty, so I added a few more tomatoes and some pineapple chunks. P.S. Don't forget to wear gloves when chopping the jalapenos! I learned my lesson the hard way.

This was so good! I was hesistant to make this because I don't love mangos, but it gave it an amazing flavor. I followed the recipe as is, but added a bit too much garlic. Be sure to not overdue it, you can always add more later, you can't take it back. Guests ate it up! Will definietly make again!

This was so good! I followed this recipe to a "T", I didn't add or change anything. I made it yesterday, and my brother-in-law, a salsa addict, happened to stop by. He tried it, and the next thing I know, he told me he ate just about all of it. I thought he was joking, but the bowl was near empty! Guess I'll be making this again real soon!

Absolutely delicious!  I make this all the time.  Sometimes I substitute pineapple (fresh or canned) for the mango, and sometimes I leave out the avocado.  I have also added corn.  This recipe is easy to tweak and it always turns out fabulous!

AMAZING!!!!!!! I put everything except the mango and advacado in the blender. Saves so much time. Then I use the mango's in the jar to save time cutting mangos. I skipt the olive oil.

FRESH, HEALTHY! Always a hit. I double the garlic and onion and half the olive oil. I also add the avocado right before serving. Tastes good the next day, too! This is now a family staple.

Made this for a fantasy football draft party. The men LOVED it even though it has no meat. Imagine that! The flavors are perfect together, next time I will add a bit more jalepeno for an extra kick. Would also make a great addition to skirt steak tacos (next time).

Awesome, easy and ready to go right away.  We used this several different ways all in one day - just with chips, on quesadillas and later on some grilled fish.   Thank you.

This was my first try at salsa, and I like the way it turned out.  I made a few changes, of course.  I skipped the cilantro and red onion.  Instead of jalepeno peppers, I added a whole green bell pepper.  In addition to the Dole jarred mango that I used, I also diced up a peach and added it. I reduced the garlic to one clove and it was still very strong.  And I also reduced the olive oil to 2 Tablespoons, and could probably have reduced even farther.  I may take some of this and blend it a little bit, for those who don't like a chunky salsa.  This is a great way to use up homegrown tomatoes.

Great salsa! Had to change cilantro to parsley (family can't stand it)and Jalapeno to bell (sis doesn't do heat) based on review, I only used 2T of oil (plenty) but I did add 1/4 tsp of a good balsamic vinegar. We were drinking the juice out of our bowls!! Had it with boiled shrimp which were swimming that morning and the tequila salsa (5 stars) from this site. What a great, good for you meal. Thx again!

This recipe was amazing. I took it to a party and it was loved by young and old alike. I only used a quarter of a cup of cilantro and half a teaspoon of salt. I also substituted lemon for lime juice. I will be making this one again and again!

I made this last night to accompany a salmon dish and it turned out wonderful.  There weren't any leftovers and I received compliments from everyone on it. I used two large tomatoes instead of four and drained the juice from them so the salsa wouldn't be so watery. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it is.

I loved this recipe.  The only thing I would change is add less garlic maybe one clove.  I love garlic but there was to much in the recipe.  I served it over marinaded (mango citrus marinade) chicken.

This salsa is delicious.  We ate it like a salad and my husband said it would be great with chips.  I left out the fresh cilantro because I don't like fresh cilantro.  The only thing I will change next time is that I will use only two tablespoons of olive oil; the third spoonful was too much.

Yum! Made this to take to a dinner party. Grilled salmon was on the menu, and this was a perfect match. Next time, I'd add another mango (the one I bought was on the small side) and cut the salt in half. Don't skimp on the cilantro.

This is my favorite recipe of all time. If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  I created an account here just to review this recipe. I have made this so much I have the recipe memorized.   It is sooooo yummy, healthy and flavorful. I lost 15 pounds last summer eating this on baked tortilla chips.   My work always requests that I bring this to our monthly potlucks.  I can't wait until my garden tomatoes are ripe this summer, we will be eating this everyday.  Thanks Fhiveshot!

I brought this to work with tortilla chips and got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  Awesome!  I used two mangos and two avocados and only 3 tomatoes since that's all I had but it was still great.

This was better sooner than later.  It got a watery after a while.  Also that "water" had an avocado color tint.  Jus' a little 411.  :) No fresh cilantro so I subbed 1T.  The red onions at the store were about to walk away so I subbed green onion (white & green pieces) for the red. First time with a mango.  You aren't supposed to peel them first. I found this out after peeling.  :(  We wrestled a little, but it didn't make it in the salsa.  'Think I would've liked it, but more jalepeno would be needed.  With one, without mango, it's kid-friendly mild.  'Think two minimum; & then three, if you add that honkin' mango.  :D  A nice "Welcome to Spring/Summer!" dish!

Great Salsa. Different from the usual salsa. Sweet & spicy & salty. Easy to make. It does take a little bit of time chopping & dicing. But it looks beautiful. I suggest serving it in a clear bowl so all the colors can be enjoyed. It looks appealing and your tastes buds are not let down when you eat it.

This recipe is delicious! I made this once last week, but I realized half-way through that I was out of jalapeño, so I had to substitute green chiles. However, one mango wasn't enough. I would definitely recommend doubling the mango. Even with these substitutions, this was delicious and gone in a few days! I am making this again tomorrow, so I will double it and use 4 mangos instead of 2, and use jalapeños to enhance the flavor. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is ok as written, but great with a few modifications. I eliminated the olive oil serves no purpose. Subbed fresh tomatoes for a can of diced tomatoes w/chiles,used lemon pepper seasoning instead of salt,2 tbs of dried cilantro not fresh,finely diced onions not chopped,added 1 diced avocado and 3 tbs of mexican hot sauce for a kick. The end result w/ homemade chips was awesome.

This was excellent. My husband only likes Mexican food made by madre and me... this got his approval. I included all the seeds with the whole diced jalapeño and used multi-colored cherry tomatoes because that's what I had. YUM. Will make this again for sure!

This is the first thing that I have reviewed on this site.  This recipe deserves more than 5 stars! I have made and taken this to many picnics and parties and the bowl always comes back empty.  I didn't have mango one time I was making it but had some peaches that needed to be used and that tasted great in it as well.  Thanks for sharing this easy, adaptable recipe!

This salsa was amazing! My whole family loved it. I used only 1/2 a jalapeno and added about 1 T blanco tequila (which I definitely recommend). It was fantastic with Bobby Flay's fish taco recipe. I will definitely make this again.

These are indeed very good!  I did modify to my liking as I went, though.  I used 2 mangoes, 2 avocados, 1/2 finely minced red onion and no olive oil.  The rest are the same.  This is a keeper and I am  posting the tweaked version on the website.

Yum! The only change I made was using a portion of canned jalapenos - I don't like real spicy foods. I actually put all the ingredients in a food processor since I like a smoother salsa. I ate some right away and froze the rest. It tasted great fresh and great after being frozen. I'll make this again.

This stuff will rock your socks off. I will use a serrano, or maybe just go to habenero next time to bring more heat. I hand chopped everything including the garlic, which gives garlic a sweeter flavor. Hand chopping also makes it less mushy and more crisp. I also threw in a orange bell pepper. Let it set in fridge for an hour before serving. I Didn't have avocado, and didn't use oil.

Fantastic!  Didn't use jalapeno since didn't have it and it still came out wonderful.  Brought it to a superbowl party and people raved!  Great with chips, or served as a condiment for turkey sandwiches.

O-M-Good!!!! I usually buy store bought salsa but saw that it would be cheaper to make my own so I decided to give it a try. And felt that with this large of a portion, I wouldn't have to purchase salsa ingredients often. Boy was I wrong!! It's cheaper and makes a good sized batch, but now I'm having to purchase salsa ingredients pretty often! But I'm not upset by any means. Rather, I'm thrilled to have found such a wonderful salsa recipe that is wonderfully fresh, colorful and delicious! I like my salsa a little spicy so the next time I make this, I plan to try adding 2 or 3 jalapeno peppers and more garlic. The cilantro and lime together can't be beaten. I'd love if I could give this recipe more than 5 stars. Well worth it!!

This is awesome. I did not think that I was going to like this at all. It's great, it has a lot of different flavors that all work nicely together. I think the longer you let it sit together and refrigerate the better it tastes.

I have also served a derivitive of this including leftover chunks of fish, lobster and shrimp; pan sauteed and served over omlets in the morning! Oh, a little louisiana hot sauce will give it a kick.
Yep... it's as good as it sounds!

YUM! YUM!  I had ripe mangoes from a friends tree but the avocados at the store were rock hard.  I added corn and black beans instead as someone else suggested.  My family inhaled this at dinner.  I served it with chips.  Next time I'm going to serve it over warm chicken!

Really, really liked this.  I was trying to duplicate Joe's Crab Shack's mango salsa.  It's a close replication, but not quite.  Even still, it's devine!  Make sure that your avocado, tomato, and mango are not over ripe to avoid soupy mixtures.

I've made this salsa a couple of times already. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. I then discovered I really dislike cilantro, so I replaced it with other herbs the next times (basil, flat leaf parsley, ...) and it tasted great. I used the salsa as a dip and as an omelet topping. 

One tiny thing though: I spent a lot more time on preparation than mentioned.

Brought this to a family Memorial Day get together - and so glad! My family is tough to please b/c they're all good cooks and I got a lot of "wow!"s from the toughest. Made exactly as recipe said and it was plenty - with tortilla chips but next time will go over fish - would be good w/any seafood. Thanks!

Loved it. So easy, so good. I strained the diced tomatoes before i added other ingredients because they were very watery, but just a preference. And I personally would put in a little less cilantro next time. It was great but took over the flavor a LITTLE too much for my liking. But all in all, 5 stars!

Really no need to add the olive oil. I think it taste better without. I added an extra jalapeno to give it a little more kick.

This salsa is the best. I was cooking for 20 people last night, so I tripled it and served it over mahi-mahi. I like to use more mango than tomato, i love all the different colors in this salsa, a definite keeper!

This is a very good salsa!  We made it to try and used it with our Basa fillets.  I do think it needs something else though...perhaps some orange zest or lemon zest or pieces or maybe some pineapple...just to give it a little bit of a sweeter note!

TIP:  Use a colander to drain the salsa after chilling it for the half hour.  It leaves the right amount of liquid.  Otherwise, it can be too watery depending on your tomatoes. TIP2:  I used 1.5 tbsp of oil and that was enough.  1/2 tbsp might work too if you're looking to have healthier meals. OVERALL:  delicious!  I served on top of tilapia and flounder marinaded in apricot juice and orange zest.  It also has beautiful presentation, with vivid colors and contrasts.  I used more mango and diced the jalapeno (instead of mincing).  Two tablespoons of lime juice require 2 limes.  Very easy and quick to make.  :)

I used 2 tomatoes, half a mango, and a whole avocado, and reduced the garlic and oil to compensate, still used one jalepeno and 1/4 c onion (had white not red) this was excellent!  I decided at the last minute to add some canned unsalted corn kernels and It really added a little something to an already excellent salsa. I will be making this for get togethers for sure!

Unbelievably good!  This is the best salsa I've made yet and I've tried quite a few recipes here.  It's a perfect blend of tropical flavors.  We had it with chips, though I'm sure it'd be good on fish as well.  Word to the wise- if you're sensitive to heat/spice, put less Jalapeno in.  I just put in half a jalapeno and it was just enough heat.  Also, I put in just one clove of garlic as opposed to 3.  I love garlic, but not quite THAT much.  Overall, a hit.

This salsa was delicious, but you really need to let it sit overnight for it to taste its best.  I added corn and seasoned black beans to the recipe, which was delicious.

What a great recipe! I followed it exactly!  It was really good even with Hot House Tomatoes.  I can hardly wait to use home grown tomatoes! My family loved it!  I'm taking this to my next pitch-in.  Thanks!

Very Yummy!!  My husband is on a diet so I completely left out the salt and olive oil and decided to serve the avacado on the side.  I can only imagine how delicious this would be if all the ingredients were added.  Yum Yum Yum!!!

I made this for my girlfriend and I for the Super Bowl and it was fantastic!!! I made a few changes:  I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 3 and thought it was still pretty strong, however I like garlic so it was fine. I got a can of jalapeños and added a tablespoon for a little heat.  I also omitted the red onion b/c unfortunately red onion is too powerful of a flavor and would mask the other great ingredients.  I also love how there is a lot of cilantro as this is one of my favorite ingredients.  I will definitely be making this again.

I can't believe there hasn't been a review in a few years!! I made this for my DH's birthday party. I made triple the batch as it was gone in seconds.   We had a couple arrive a little late and they never even saw the bowl on the table.... gone, empty, devoured. Guests have emailed me requesting the recipe.  So fresh and yummy. I will be making this again.

This salsa was a big hit with me and my husband. We used pineapple instead of mango (we didn't have any at the time), and next time, we will try the mango.   I did learn to only make what I think will get eaten, because this did not keep well in the refrigerator (on account of the avocado).

If I could give this 10 stars I would!! My husband has been bringing up this salsa every couple days since I made it weeks ago! It is perfect with every Mexican dish and it makes any homemade Mexican meal feel like you have gone to an amazing restaurant. It really isn't difficult to put together, and it is SO worth it. When I made it I didn't have any red onion so I used white, and I didn't have any jalapenos so I used a tiny amount of cayenne (I didn't want it to be too spicy for those sensitive to it). Thanks for the amazing recipe

Very good!  I planned on making this recipe exactly as indicated but my mango was funky, so subbed in a nectarine instead.  Aside from that, followed the directions and it was great!  Very tasty!  :)

This was fabulous!  I did modify slightly.  I doubled the recipe, and used 3 mangos istead of 2.  I also decreased the tomatoes fom 8 to 6.  I used a very small can of sliced jalapenos.  It was the perfect mix of heat & sweet.  From start to finish it took me 45 minutes to make this.  Worth the time considering all the fresh fruit & veggies that I had to cut.  Will make this again and again.

Sustituted a chili for the jalepeno so not too spicey. Dropped one of the tbsp of olive oil. Really, really good. We ate it with chips, but I can't wait to try it again but on fish on the grill next time.

First off, this tastes amazing.  I tried it as soon as I had finished preparing it at room temp and thought it was great then, but then I tried it this morning, and WOW, what a great combination af tastes!  It really tantalizes your taste buds.  Having said that, I rated it a 4, because of the inaccuracy of the prep time.  I guess if you some really fancy food processor that will not make mush out of the ingredients, then maybe 15 minutes is realistic.  I spent 45 minutes preparing the tomatoes (I remove the pulp), avacado, and mango.  I chopped them by hand.  With the onion, garlic, jalepeno (after removing the seeds), and fresh coriander, I made quick work of it with my pampered chef chopper.  This is definately a keeper. I will entertain with this all year round!

I served this with Chilean Sea Bass and it was great. I squeezed out the tomato seeds like some people suggested and I like how that turned out. I was also afraid that the mango I used was too tart and the avocado was not ripe enough, so I added three ripe kiwis. I have to say that the kiwi added a little sweetness that blended well with the rest of the salad. It would taste great with homemade baked tortilla chips too.

Diet tip:  You don't need to add the oil. Delete it and you can eat it guilt free as it is then a mixture of fresh fruit and vegetables.  What a mixture it is - so delicious.  Of course leave in the oil if you want the health benefits!  I used a large jalapeno pepper and thought I could still handle a bit more heat so will try more next time. Also will add a bit more lime juice as I found the flavor a bit too subtle and want more of it.   I used Mango but next time I will try pineapple as the Mango was hard to dice without it turning mushy. Overall a delicious fresh treat!

Very good! However, if you don't like your salsa too spicy I wouldn't the whole jalapeno in. The spice was perfect for me but my boyfriend tends to like his food mild and although he loved the salsa, it was a little to spicy for him.

This is excellent and even good as a snack.  My 1 year old daughter loves it and it's good for her!  A few things though... make sure you buy a mango that's ripe but not too ripe or it's stringy when you try to cut it.  And the same goes for the avocado... not too ripe or it gets very squishy or sometimes turns into a paste when you mix everything together.  Still tastes excellent but the presentation is not the same.

Everyone loved this salsa. I used a can of sliced jalapenos, it was a bit on the spicy side. I also took peoples advace and used 2 avacados it was the perfect amount. Next time I think I'll leave out the olive oil, there was enough juice without it, so why add the extra fat.

I made this to accompany salmon and it was awesome! Everyone just loved it. It was perfect with the salmon. I made a few modifications: omitted the salt and oil, and added lemon juice and white balsamic vinegar. I also used a poblano pepper because of the recent jalapeno recall. That also worked out well because poblano’s are milder and I was making it for a lot of people and didn’t want too much heat. It is very easy to make: just peel the mangoes with a potato peeler, and cut the (unpeeled) avocado lengthwise into segments, remove the pit, and cut into cubes. I also think next time I will add the avocado right before serving as it tends to turn to mush. I will definitely make it again. Thank you!

Great salsa, everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I changed a couple things after making this once and added a half an avocado extra to the recipe and removed the juice and seeds from the tomatoes before dicing them to make the salsa less juicy. Thanks!

This is a great crowd pleaser. I used defrosted frozen mango because I hate peeling and dicing mangoes and double the quantity. I also add a can of rinsed black beans. I don't add the cilantro because my boyfriend doesn't like it and it tastes fine without (although I would definitely add it otherwise!)

The taste is exceptional when everything is fresh (not canned).  It was a little time consuming for the chopping and dicing, but sooooo worth it.  For the two of us, we had it on grilled chicken breasts one night and husband wanted it over salmon the next night and there was plenty.  Thanks for sharing this!!

WOW was this ever so yummy!! I made it last night for a BBQ and today I only have enough for a chip if that. Make sure you double the batch for it will go fast. The only thing I added was 1 serrano along with the jalapeno. It was perfect flavor. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty. We prefer less garlic cause it overwhelmed the salsa. Never had avocado but loved it in this recipe. Can't wait to make it again.

My family LOVES this salsa.  I leave out the jalapenos and oil, and it still tastes great.  I agree that homegrown or veggie stand tomatoes make a big difference.

Excellent and refreshing!  I used canned mild green chiles instead of jalapeno since my family is not big on the heat.  I also had to used dry cilantro since the grocery store was out of fresh.  I probably threw in a couple of tablespoons.  It was wonderful!

This is by far the best salsa I have ever made.  I doubled the recipe and still amongst about 10 people it was gone in a half hour.  I am so excited to make it again this weekend for 2 parties.  After buying the ingredients, I don't want to wait, I want to make it and eat it all now!

This salsa is fantastic! I made a huge amount the first time and two days later had to make more.  Like another reviewer, I added a can of corn and a can of black beans, which was made the salsa just that more delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  I did add a can of black beans as suggested by another reviewer to give it more body, and left out the oil completely.  It didn't seem to need it.  It took awhile to convice my husband to taste it; the mangos scared him, but once he did, he couldn't stop eating it.

Wow!  I shortcut my way through the entire thing and it still tastes great!  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, garlic from the jar, no avocado and lemon juice from a bottle.  The only "fresh" ingredients I had were mango, parsely (in place of cilantro) and green onions (in place of red).  Can't wait to try it with all of the correct fresh ingredients.

This is a great party pleaser!  Takes a little time to prepare (because I like to dice everything into smaller pieces than the recipe calls for), but it is so worth it!  I leave out the majority of the oil.  Tastes great with blue corn tortilla chips.

This was a little to sweet for me.  It might of been because I don't like spicey food so I substuited green pepper in for the jalepeno.  But still I wanted more onion/cinantro flavor and less mango.

Yum, great flavors.  I also make this just using more tomatoes and omit the avacado and mango. If avacado is too ripe it tends to just mush and make it appear "milky".

This salsa was very good.  I added an extra avocado and will probably add another mango next time. I used a food processor to chop and mix everything but the consistency probably would have been better if I cut it by hand.

This easily became a new favorite last night. Loved the flavor combinations. I too only used 1 clove of garlic. Served as a dip, but plan on trying as a garnish for baked fish or chicken soon.

I loved this salsa and it held up well in the fridge for a couple of days.  Great way to use the garden tomatoes.  I did add cumin to mine to give it a little more spice.

This recipe is excellent.  I only used 2 cloves of garlic based on other reviews and it was still garlicky.  I also used the juice of 2 limes (more than 2 T) and then let it sit for 2 hours or so.  Rave reviews from friends.  I will definitely make again.

I was very excited to make this for my Mother's Day appetizer to bring to my mom's today, but I have to say I was a little disappointed.  I can't put my finger on it.........I guess I was expecting a little more of a sweetness to it from the mango??  I put extra mango and even a dash of sugar at the end.  I even made it the night before to make sure the flavors blended together, but I didn't put in the avacado until right before serving.  My family really enjoyed it, as did I, but it didn't "WOW" me like I thought it would.  I'm glad I tried it though......

Oh My Gosh! This was so good.  My hubby and I had it over backed Mahi Mahi.  I also ate it by the chip full what was left over.  I did not use as many tomatoes as was called for because I did not want it to be primarily tomato, and I used a little bit more of the Avocado.  I actually used equal amounts of Avocado, Tomato, and Mangos.  I also left out the oil.  With the tomatoes and mango there is plenty of juice in the end result.  Definately a keeper in our home!

I tried the Mango salsa today. Absolutely fabulous!! A flavorful blend. Everyone wanted the recipe, it was gone in just minutes. Thick, chunky. The only thing I would do differently is get less ripe avocados, and more ripened mangos.  Papaya is a nice touch also. Am making this again, as people cant seem to get enough! A true five-star keeper. Thanks for sharing this.

Excellent! Great on Tortilla chips, you can't stop eating it! To save a few calories I made it with and without the olive oil.  I did not notice any difference in taste.

This was amazing.  I only used about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and didn't measure the other ingredients exactly, but it came out great!  I served it as a dip with chips and my husband and I couldn't get enough of it.  DELICIOUS recipe - can't say enough good things about it!

This is AMAZING salsa.  I can eat the entire bowl in one sitting.  I make it all the time and I always eat it with lime Tostitos. I only use 2 tomatoes so it's extra mango-ey and I use the juice from the entire lime (never measured it).  Otherwise don't mess around with a great thing!  It's a pot luck favorite and you'd be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't love this (provided they like mangoes and tomatoes of course:).

5 stars for me!!  This was such a great fresh salsa.  Mangos were subtle but gave it a new twist from traditional salsa.  I served it at a dinner party and they loved it!  I had to give out the recipe!

Great!!  Just realized I forgot to add the oil but I don't think it needs it.  Next time I will reduce the salt.  This recipe is a great base to add other things as suggested such as black beans or grilled corn.

To make more, I added another mango, 1 large fresh tomato and 1 can of diced tomatoes with chilis, and another can of diced tomatoes (Fennel and Red Pepper), 4 garlic cloves, 1 TBSP EVOO, 2 TBSP White Wine Vinegar, another jalapeno, cup of cilantro, 1 1/2 TBSP sugar, 2 sweet onions, the juice of 1 lime. I let it sit overnight and serve it over baked salmon, or even store bought rotisserie chicken with tortilla chips and rice! Yummo. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so delicious and fresh tasting.  I usually use three mangos though.  Sometimes I leave out the jalapeno and add a cut up green pepper and can of green chilies.

This is the best salsa that I have ever had in my life. Me and my family just could not stop eating it! We spread it over some grilled pita bread and that was delicious. This is going to be one of our weekly dinners. It is also very delicious with blue corn chips. We doubled it and it served three people. I would recommend when doubling to only use two handfulls of red onion, the same amount of lime juice, and only four cloves of garlic. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! This would also be a great recipe to make for a party as well. =)

A great blend of flavors, and just a little heat.  I love this salsa - it's completely addicting to munch on.

This is so good! I've made it twice now. I used a drained 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes both times (I like thinner salsa) and it's turned out wonderfully! My boyfriend doesn't like salsa or tomato and even he loves it! It gets better every day it sits in the fridge too! Quadruple this recipe and keep it handy! I would like to try canning this one someday!

This salsa is considerable mild.  I was expecting a bit more heat.  Great smell.  Great flavor.  Can't wait to share it with my friends.

Excellent salsa and so healthy too!!  Make it all the time and one can alter the ingredients adding less and more of what one prefers.  I make it all the time now especially since I have a mango, avocado and lemon tree in my back yard.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Even though it takes me quite some time to do all the chopping it is certainly worth the effort.  Will makes this many more times.

This was delicious!  I eyeballed all the ingredients and added more of certain ones depending on preference.  I served this over pineapple chicken on a bed of jasmine rice.  You could easily eat it by itself.  The color is wonderful!

If you are looking to make variations, pineapple would be a great addition or substitution for the mango.  The pineapple in the chicken dish complimented this salsa nicely.

I just double the garlic and red onions. I also use 2 ghost peppers, 1 cerano pepper, and 2 habanero peppers instead of 1 measly jalapeno. Yes i love it spicy. I leave the seeds in the pepper too. I dont drain the tomatoes either because I like it a little wet. One more tip. I use an under ripe mango and avocado because if the mango and avocado are all the way ripe then it takes away from all the other flavors.

I love this recipe! I followed it exactly and it was the hit of the party! The best part is for left overs the next night I had it over scrod and for breakfast I made an omelet with it and my husband and son loved both dishes! The following week my 22 year old son made the dip himself and had it with his chicken sandwich. I think that's the first time I saw my son make a recipe!
Thank you for sharing!

OMG!!  This is a 10 STAR recipe.  Everyone THINKS that this is such a strange combination but when you look at the ratings of over 630 people giving it 5 stars, well, you just have to try it for yourself to see!!  You won't be sorry.

I made this yesterday in a rush, forgot the red onion and left out the oil (intentionally). People loved it anyway. As a (mostly) vegan it fits easily into my diet, and the gluten-free diets of some of the folks I was with. Next time I'll add in the onion.

I was hesitant to make this salsa because of how the mango was going to blend with the flavours. I'm glad I tried this, it was super good! The mango gives a subtle sweetness that I really liked.

This salsa has a great flavor but not enough heat for our house.  Next time I will add extra jalepeno.  I made a triple batch and left out the avacado so my husband can take it out of the fridge later and eat it.

I didn't actually eat this (I don't like jalapenos or red onions) but I made it for a party.  Mine didn't look anything like the picture, it turned out more gloppy-looking.  People said it still tasted really good though.  

I was struggling with how to cut the mango and I found a YouTube video that made it REALLY easy.  I applied the same principles to the avocado then.  The video is:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvLdPjpELyU

Overall, I guess the taste was good but I wasn't wowed by the presentation.

This is so incredibly good with a fresh mango and summer tomatoes. I threw this together in my food processor, so it was more pureed than chopped, but I like that style of salsa so it worked out. I am planning to use it to dress up basic tacos tonight, but that will only happen if I don't eat the whole batch with tortilla chips first! Yum!

Wow, aboslutely delicious!! This is one of the best salsas I have ever had. The changes I made were to use white onion in place of red and leave out the olive oil. Turned out perfect!! I love this recipe, and will be making it often!! Thanks so much for sharing:)

Well worth all the effort needed for prepping. I made this salsa for a Mexican themed pot luck and it was the first thing gone. I was unsure about how mango would go in salsa but the mixture of sweet and spicy...delicious. I've even made it again since then. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is always asked for after I serve it. There are so many variations you can make, that you really can't go wrong. If I don't have tomatoes on hand, I add red pepper. I sometimes omit the avacado if mine is overripened. I made the mistake of waiting until the mango was soft a few times, and the recipe appeared mushy. You can use a mango that isn't soft and the taste doesn't change…the salsa looks nicer. My family loves this salsa. We serve it over fish and chicken with rice, with whole wheat tortilla chips, and we've even chopped up lettuce and served it with chicken for a lowcarb dinner. This is a family favorite every summer!

I use a habanero chili instead of the jalapeno for a bit of extra heat and I have been known to cheat and use a jar of Dole sliced mangos instead of fresh -  star salsa of the potluck anyways.

Amazingly refreshing and delicious! I had it at a potluck at work and then made a double batch at home --half to serve with grilled chicken and half to bring to a family cookout. Well, my husband liked it so much, he finished off the whole bowl, so I had to make another batch for the cookout -- it was just as popular there, none left for me, so I made a third batch when I got home. So versatile and so easy! And if, you don't like cilantro (I don't), substitute fresh parsley, just as delicious!

Just made this tonight to go with a simple grilled halibut with salt and pepper.  So good we were scooping it up with tortilla chips as well.  Followed the recipe using roma tomatoes (took the seeds out) but skipped the oil.  Perfect.

This salsa is soooo yummy! If you're headed to a party, make sure to make a double batch because people will keep coming back for more... or just stand beside the salsa and keep eating :) FYI, it takes quite a while to chop everything up, so make sure you give yourself enough time to make it to avoid accidentally chopping off your finger :)

This recipe is just perfect! I just use 1/2 japaleno and 2 cloves garlic. Try to cut everything in small pieces, and serve with Tostitos Scoops :)

This recipe was absolutely FANTASTIC! This was the perfect mixture of flavors. The mango complimented the avocado very well. I must say that FRESH cilantro is a must! Don't skip and try the dried. The fresh adds so much to this salsa. If you like spice, you may want to add more than 1 jalapeno. I made this as an appetizer for a cookout and had people telling me it should be bottled and sold. Your guests will love this!!!!

Excellent recipe - I made it as written except I used a red pepper in place of the tomato - next time I will be sure to make a double batch because my son and I ate most of the first batch before supper !!

I made this salsa tonight and it was absolutely delicious. I normally do not like "chunky" salsas, but this one has a perfect combination of flavors--including just a touch of spicy and sweet. I used double the amount of jalapeno, since the one I had gotten was mild. To balance it, I added a little extra chopped avocado. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and served with restaurant-style tortilla chips.

Delicious!  I initially found this by randomly putting in "odd" ingredients from my refrigerator.  I figured I'd give it a shot and I am sure glad I did!  I persoally thought it was a bit salty so next time (yes, there will be a next time) I will put in half of what is called for.  I also did not put any jalepnos in since I didn't have any nor do I like spicey stuff.  I also just now noticed I was suppose to put in lime juice, instead of the lemon juice I added. This is scrumptious with or without tortilla chips!

I halved the recipe which was the perfect amount and used only 1 tomato (which was still a bit too much for our taste).  Otherwise followed recipe and it was delicious.

This was very good.  I was eating it with tortilla chips, but I kept thinking how good it be over grilled salmon, or with grilled shrimp.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe.

Excellent!  I served this with pork empanadas as an appetizer and it was a perfect contrast of sweet and savory.  There was a little leftover the next day and it was great with tortilla chips as well!

We were satisfied enough. I didn't like avacados but love mangoes and vice versa for my husband so it was a compromise.

Delicious.  I am a garlic lover and found that 3 cloves seemed a bit overbearing.  The next time I made it (the next night :-) I used 2 and it was perfect.

I've been wanting to make this for a long time..finally did, and it was terrific.  Only thing i did differently was squeezed the tomato juice out of the tomatoes (per reviews) to reduce the liquid in the salsa and i was glad i did.  Had 10 people and tripled the recipe...worried i had way too much, but there was very little left over.  It looked beautiful and got rave reviews.  Also, maybe i'm slow...and granted, I did triple the recipe...but all that peeling, chopping and dicing took me a long, long, time.

This was good. My husband liked it more than I did. I thought it was a little mushy with the mangos and avacados but it did have a good flavor. Good for something different but don't think I'd make it again... just not our taste.

Made this yesterday to bring to a party and there was not a drop left!   Everyone LOVED it!   I bought enough ingredients to double the recipe, but didn't use all of it.  I used 2 avocados, 2 mangos, 6 tomatoes, 1 pepper, maybe a 1/4 c of cilantro, 1 large garlic clove, and about 3 t of lime.  I did not need the olive oil, there was enough juice from the tomato.  EXCELLENT recipe!

I made this right before heading out to a picnic this evening.  I used two mangos instead of just one as others have suggested, two jalapenos (still relatively mild, if you slice them right!) and will cut back on the cilantro a bit next time.  I also added black beans to help balance out the sweetness of the mango and the cilantro flavor.   Absolutely delicious! I don't like things that are spicy, and even with two jalapenos it was more sweet than spicy.   Will cut out the olive oil next time too, there is no reason for the extra fat!

This is definitely a 5 star recipe! OMG good! people were raving about this salsa. I did not change a thing. There's a lot of prepwork involved. The next time I make this, I will make it the night before without the crushed garlic, and mix that in before serving. This way it will still have that fresh taste. The avocado holds up really well the next day.

The only changes I make are to use only 1/2 of an avocado, use grape or cherry tomatoes, and skip the oil.  YUM.  I'll be eating this all summer.

I made this for some family who were over for a BBQ and everyone raved! I was afraid that it might come out too spicy for them, but I seeded the jalapeño and it was actually quite mild. I could go with a little more kick, but it sure disappeared fast!

Wow.  This salsa was great.  I put mine on top of tacos, and it tasted fantastic.  I chopped some sliced jalapeno up and used that instead of the fresh because I forgot to get it at the store.  But I definately plan on making this salsa again.  Really really great.

One of our very favorite recipes ever. I make this regularly. Other than adjusting the heat (less for my kids, more for party guests) and using a little less olive oil, I make this recipe as written - it's perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly (which I rarely do because I like to make food according to mine and my boyfriend's tastes :))  We loved it.  Like a lot of other reviewers, we were eating it out of the bowl with tortilla chips before dinner was ready.  Fantastic salsa, will be making it again :)

This was a good salsa, but I would make a few changes.  I definitely wouldn't put that much cilantro.  Its flavor really took over the avocado and mango.  Also, I would make it a lot spicier.

This really sounded like a good recipe, but in my opinion there is way too much onion (could be my own fault), way too much garlic and too much olive oil in this recipe. I like the fruit flavor, so I wish there was more mango. Two stars were given because I think the recipes should be rated on how they turned out when the directions were followed, not on how the recipe turned out after modifications. If I were to try this again, and I might, I'd use one garlic clove, 1 1/2 cups of diced tomatoes, and 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. I would also make sure to chop the mango and avocado into smaller chunks. The onion was a little strong, but I may have used more than 1/4 cup because I eye balled it instead of measuring. The garlic and onion flavors hung around in my mouth for a few hours after dinner. I really like mango and any fruit with salsa, so I will try this again with my own modifications.

Wonderful combination of flavors in this recipe.  Only used 1/2 a jalapeno pepper, but that still gave it enough spice.  Huge hit at a holiday party!

A very welcome change from the standard salsa.  Didn't look as chunky as the picture the first time I made it.  The next time, I used mangos that were on the verge of being ripe, but not soft yet.  Gave the salsa a great texture, and the flavor was still great. Will definitely make this again and again and again.  My sister-in-law, said she would not make it as it was too labor intensive for her, until she tasted it.  She quickly changed her mind.

Fantastic! I left out the avocado due only to the fact that I am canning for the season a ton of tomatoes. I will add avocado as I serve, the complexity of this salsa is marvelous. Each bite forces your tongue to explore what it is tasting.

I QUADRUPLED this recipe for my son's birthday party!!  It was gone in under 30 minutes! Thanks goodness I had some decent store bought salsa to go with the fajitas I made as our main course! I used Roma tomatoes and canned jalapenos. They were great. Then I discovered I had run out of olive oil.  My husband ran to the store for the oil, but after taste testing the salsa without it, I decided it didn't need it.  It was fantastic without it.  Even after squeezing out the juice from the tomatoes, the salsa was still a little soupy, so I just used a fine strainer and let some of the extra juice drain off. A lot of chopping involved, but so worth it!!!! Yummy!

This is REALLY good!  It's worth all the chopping. I added another tablespoon of lime juice, extra cilantro, extra garlic, and I didn't de-seed the jalapeno (I like my salsa hot). Also, it's easiest to use a vegetable peeler for the mango.  Mmmmm...

I made this twice. The first time I chopped fresh garden tomatoes.  The second time I used canned diced tomatoes with chiles.  Honestly - they both were great.   So, maybe using canned tomatoes isn't so bad  - it certainly saved a lot of time.

This salsa is amazing!  I wouldn't change a thing!  It's relatively easy to make and I know I will be making it for every occasion now!  I tried it on white fish as well, and it works great ...offers a great presentation as well.

This is so great!  I love chunky salsa, and the mango adds an unusual kick to it.  It's the perfect summer snack.  I like a little more kick to my salsa, so I use two jalapeño peppers.  I do seed the tomatoes too, so it doesn't get soupy.

Refreshing salsa that was loved by all. As others have said, a lot of chopping but well worth it. I used garlic salt instead of plain salt.

Fresh and colourful!  This was a hit at my bbq last weekend.  Since it's been so hot here, it was a light, refreshing salsa.  Just be prepared to do a lot of chopping.

This was so tasty, especially with the right mangos and tomatoes.  I made a full batch, brought it to a staff potluck (with only 6 people) and it was gone in no time.

Absolutely delightful, as the other reviewers have indicated.  My SO said we'd have to bring the recipe with us to a cookout as everyone would want it.  I said that was presumptous -- NOT.  Everyone wanted it.  He suggested next time, leaving some seeds in the pepper as it didn't have any kick in it.  He also thought it would be good to use the Roma tomatoes that aren't as mushy.

This is really delicious!  I doubled the recipe and just put two garlic cloves and it was more than enough.  My friend at work said I could make it and sell it, but it does require a lot of chopping.  Sure is eye appealing too.

I followed the recipe exactly, but unfortunately my mango wasn't ripe and it didn't really add to the flavor.  Next time I'll let my mango ripen a while longer!

Delicious, but I actually like it best without the avocado.  I agree with the person who posted it, I add it to a lot of different dishes.  Thanks for a great recipe

I never leave a review but I have to say this was an excellent salsa! Mine was chunky but I stayed true to the recipe. It was a hit at our housewarming! I will definitely make this over the summer. Thank you for a lovely recipe!

Huge success!  I was looking at another recipe, got them confused, and accidentaly added pineapple.  No one thought it was a mistake.  They all loved!  We served it with mahi mahi that we grilled.  Delicious!  Will use this recipe again!

This is fabulous. I left out the jalapeno because we don't like heat so much. We ate the whole bowl in one sitting.

AWESOME!!  I doubled the garlic because I love it and added a little extra jalapenos because we wanted it a little spicier.  This is awesome salsa.

This salsa is delicious and great over fish or with chips.  All of my guests loved it. Only change was to limit cilantro to 1T max but that is a personal preference as I am not a fan of cilantro.  Great salsa to bring to a party.

Excellent! I scaled up the recipe, but tried to keep the volume of mango, tomato, and avocado equal to each other, because I thought balancing the colors would make it more visually appealing. So I used 2 mangoes, 3 avocados, and enough quartered cherry tomatoes to make it look balanced. Took it to a pot luck and it got devoured, even though the habanero pepper I used made it very spicy. Only criticism is that it takes a long time to make--so much chopping.

This stuff is so good.  I changed up the ratios just a bit and added 2 avocados and only 3 tomatoes since it's not tomato season right now.  I mixed it all together and realized I forgot the olive oil but I tasted it and it was SO good I decided it didn't need it.  It's super simple and really healthy.  Make sure you make it just before you want to serve it cause it won't keep well at all.  That doesn't matter though because it will be eaten very quickly.

Best salsa I have ever had!!  I will make it again!  It's fruity, but still spicy.  My friend and I made it for a movie night and the only person who said they didn't like it didn't actually try it. :P

This was excellent.  I used hot sauce instead of a jalapeno because I don't like them.  Other than that, I did the recipe as is.  It was a little bit soupy at the bottom, but the flavor was to die for.  We used it in some fajitas we made for dinner and it was fabulous.  We will be making this again.

MMMMM! Very good salsa. I brought this to a weekend camping trip and it was gone in minutes even though I made a double batch! The only thing I left out was the cilantro as I didnt have any and it was still delicious! Thanks for the recipe! It is a keeper.

Great salsa.  I didn't add the oil and couldn't taste the avocado but the flavor combination is great.  I am going to try this with pineapple as well.  Very refreshing summer dip or chicken/fish accompaniment.  Thank you for sharing!

Followed the recipe exactly, it tasted light, fresh, and healthy! The jalapeno we used wasn't very spicy, so next time, we'll try 2. Also, I will add another mango to the recipe next time. Thanks!

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this one!  The only (minor) changes I made were to use fresh parsley instead of cilantro (my hubby & I truly despise cilantro!) and used green onion instead of red as that's what I had.  I also used equal parts of lime juice/olive oil...a fantastic, yummy and fresh salsa!  Served with blue corn tortillas and will be having leftovers (yeah!) tonight over grilled salmon...yum!

Made this for the first time yesterday (except for the avocado which I added right before serving) and took to a picnic today.  Everyone asked for the recipe!  Very time consuming but worth the effort for a healthy appetizer.  Will try it over grilled chicken for dinner tomorrow.

I made this for a backyard barbecue, and everyone loved it.  I had to email the link to AllRecipes to every guest.  I doubled the recipe so I could serve it with lime corn chips (every bit was eaten) AND I used it as a sauce on grilled chicken.

OH MY!!!! I was looking for a side dish to complement my pulled pork sandwiches, three bean salad and homemade coleslaw (all of which I got from this website!)and I came upon this. I cooked for two days and made this as a last minute thing...I served it with Lime Corn Chips and I don't think anybody even noticed the rest of my meal!!!

I've made this several times already and can't believe that I haven't rated it yet!  This salsa is amazing and I have received many compliments.  When going to a dinner party, the hostess requested it specifically!

I've made this several times and it gets even better the next day.  Tastes WONDERFUL on fish too!!  My family now requests this regularly and everywhere I take it, I am asked by SOMEONE for the recipe.  Absolutely delicious!!  I noticed someone made a comment about the oil.  Consumption of Olive Oil can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease so please don't be afraid to use it :)

This is a staple in my home!! We love to have this with Cajun grilled Salmon and jasmine rice and then enjoy the leftovers with tortilla chips for days after!  Soo good.  I do reduce the amount of olive oil to 1 TBSP and I add a bit extra jalapeno (we like our food with some kick!) It's a great make-ahead too, as it's even better the next day. Make this for company and they will be begging for the recipe!

Believe the hype! This is probably the best salsa I've ever eaten. One of the 4 tomatoes I used was locally grown (and thus awesome-tasting); the others were typical storebought. The mango and avocado were pretty good typical storebought produce. I think the local tomato made a significant difference, but this is going to taste awesome no matter what. My girlfriend also raved about it. 

This is not just a condiment-- You can also mix with black beans and serve over orzo. Delicious, easy and very satisfying meal!

Great recipe, thank you!  My advice: don't add oil (doesn't need it) and up the jalapeños to two or three.  One of the best recipes ever!

If there were 10 stars I'd give it 10. This was AMAZING********** I did use dried cilantro and omitted the onion and olive oil. Didn't miss it a BIT. I also only had lemon juice so had that instead of the lime. I had it on chicken breast, as a dip w/blue corn chips and in my salad w/salmon... TO DIE FOR each time. Highly, highly recommended. Can't wait to make again!!

I loved the variety of falvors, but felt it needed more zip/spice and less cilantro (which I love, but it was overpowering).

Delicious!  We just made this and I haven't even refridgerated it yet...it is so good I am going to have a hard time waiting 30 minutes!
We doubled the recipe and added only 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Tasted good even before adding any.  What a fantastic summer salsa.  It did take a while to prepare (we used all fresh ingredients), but it was worth it in the end!

This was a first at Mango Salsa for me and everyone loved it!!!  I used 3 mangos, because they were small and I like the sweet flavor it gave.  Didn't use any jalapenos.  Excellent recipe!

This salsa was very good.  I made it for a Cinco de Mayo party and everyone liked it.  I left a few of the Jalapeno seeds in to give it some extra kick, used a bit more lime juice, and cut the Olive Oil down to 1 Tbsp.  Good recipe.  Chopping everything isn't the most fun to do...but, is well worth it when you taste all the fresh flavors.

A lovely salsa dish. The mangoes create a very unique flavour. I did make some of my own variations though. I didn't use the avocado because I didn't have any, I added 1/2 tspn cumin, and 2tspn hot sauce to create an extra hot zing. I will definitely make it again, and maybe I'll try using avocado next time as well.

Fresh, easy, perfect summer salsa.  I think I made this every Sunday last summer - had it out by the pool, took it to parties, and had it for company.  I usually use 2 avocados.

I make this salsa all of the time.  It is nice to know that someone else likes it enough to post the recipe.  One thing I must say is that the yellow(champagne)mangos are the sweetest and the best to use when you can get them!

This was a great salsa!  I am a pretty tough critic of my own cooking, so I thought it was just pretty good.  However, I have brought it to two cookouts this summer, and everyone raved over it both times.  I was even asked if I had a spoon so they could just eat it from the bowl.  My bro-in-law (who is picky about his salsa) parked himself in front of the bowl and ate half of it.  I did have to add an extra pepper for a little more bite, but my peppers may have been a little mild.  I am bringing it to another get-together this weekend!

Really yummy and forgiving recipe.

I've made this several times and it's always delicious.

I don't use the pepper.  I also cut way back on the salt and olive oil. I would suggest starting out with a little of each and working your way up to what's called for based on taste and preference. If you're using less than 4 tomatoes, the measurements called for throw things off.

Lemon works as a nice substitue for the lime juice and if you have neither, the salsa doesn't suffer. Same goes for the cilantro!

This recipe is awesome!  It was wonderful on tilapia.  I used 2 mangos, included the seeds of the pepper, and used grape tomatoes sliced in half.

My fiance and I gobbled this up in 10 minutes!  I made some slight changes: 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 1, 2 tbsp. olive oil instead of 3, 2 medium roma tomatoes instead of 4 (i removed the seeds to reduce the amount of liquid), and 1/4 cup cilantro instead of 1/2 cup. i didn't have any jalepenos, so i substituted 1 dried red chile pepper. I didn't have any fresh limes, so I used bottled lime juice.  It still came out soooo delicious!  I will be bringing this to my next party.

I have never made fresh salsa before but there was a contest at the county fair so I thought I'd give it a shot, this one was so highly reccommended I went with it.  I got all my veggies at Wal-mart (not known for great produce) I mangled the mango while trying to pit it and my avocado was too ripe so my salsa ended up looking like green chunky....well, you know...and I STILL won 1st place at the fair!  Good stuff!

Wow! This was amazingly delicious. My husband grilled mahi-mahi and we served this on top! I knew it was a hit the instant he bit into it. We used to leftovers for snacking with tortilla chips. This is a keeper. WONDERFUL!!

I really enjoyed this salsa, and I'm not much of a mango fan as is.  I used it with tortilla chips and as a topping for tacos!  There was a tad too much oil for my liking, so I think next time I'll just skip that.

Ok. I was skeptical about this recipe. The thought of mixing fruit with onions and olive oil and veggies just didn't sit right with me. To my surprize it tasted fantastic. The blend of ingredients and spices was perfect. I brought it to work on Cinco de Mayo and they loved it. They all just sat around the bowl and chowed down. They also made me promise to bring in the recipe. I wouldn't change a thing, except put in another jalepeno pepper if you like it really spicy.

So good! I made to serve with grilled halibut and I didn't have tortilla chips to "test" its flavor when I was done by was vastly content standing at the counter eating it with a spoon! Yum. Like all fresh salsa it doesn't keep well you want to eat by the second day, but it's not a problem here. The only changes I made were using a serrano pepper and a whole cup or more of cilantro.

This was a great recipe.  I substituted green peppers for jalapenos and I omitted the tomato (family hates) and it was still great.  I would back off on the garlic though may be my cloves were really big but I would use two instead next time.  The flavors are even better the next day.

Fantastic, this is exactly what I was looking for.  I once ate at a Tex Mex place in Southern California that served a mango salsa that was to die for.  This tastes exactly like it.  I served it at my husband's birthday party, it was gone in the first hour and the next day I had two women call for the recipe.  I used 3 canned jalepeno's and it was perfect.  I will be making this all summer as my tomatoes start to ripen.

I thought this was absolutely delicious and I will make again for my next party.  It did get "mixed" reviews, but it's sort of eclectic - just waht I was looking for with a bit of sweet and savory.  Also, it makes a ton.  There were about 15 people at my party and I still had about a half of it left!!!

This was good because I had use these items before they went bad. I didn't have a red onion so used a quarter of white.  I added an extra avocado which kinda over powered the mango. But this is a refreshing salsa. Will make it again

oh my.. this is SO GOOD! I love the flavor of the olive oil with all of the other flavors! I made this today for the second time and both times I doubled the batch, but only used one heaping tsp of salt. Also added extra jalapenos to taste. One of my mangoes was  a bit under ripe, but it turned out perfect because it gave a little "crunch" to the salsa. Delicious! Thank you!

This is very good, I used it as a topping over fresh Cod over rice. I did use a little bit of a spicy rub on the fish so the spicy/sweet combo was perfect. I will be making this again very soon.

Really good salsa. Made with purple tomatoes for more of a purple and gold for tailgating. Very tasty. I did drain the tomatoes and think that helped. Next time will add more jalapeno.

I looking for something to top off fish tacos with. This receipe was quick, easy, and inexpensive. Only took a few minutes of prep, and left it to chill while I grilled the fish. 
I used just a tad more lime juice than the recipe called for, but that was more for the fish.
It was truly refrshing, and perfect for the hot summer evening!

I made this based off all the great reviews it received. I needed to make a salsa for a contest at work. I won third place! Although a lot of people thought it was a guacamole because the avocado I got was very ripe and when trying to dice it, and gently mix the ingredients together, it got mashed up a bit and wasn't as solid as it shows in the picture. People still loved it though!

We tried this recipe because I’m trying to use a new fruit or vegetable and also eat healthier. Mango was that fruit this time. It turned out great. We ate it right after making it with Great Valu tortilla chips. To make things easier I used Rotella diced tomatoes with chilies to cut out a few steps. Plus, I do mild spicy not hot spicy and the jalapeño scared me. We used 2 cloves of garlic since ours had a stronger taste. We bought/used a ripe avocado and not sure if that made the tomatoes look a little weird or they came that way. I cut the EVOO down to 1TBSP. Thank you so very much for a great recipe. I will make again.

Followed the recipe exactly and the only person at the party who enjoyed it was my 6 year old. I ended up throwing it out since there was more than even she could finish.

I only gave it 4 stars because 3 cloves of garlic is WAY TOO much given the quantities of the other ingredients.  The 2nd time I made it I tweeked the amounts to better reflect our tastes and it  was delicious.  I used only one garlic clove, less tomato and more avocado and cilantro.  Easy and oh so good.  Thanks for a delightful salsa.

This was a huge hit.  I used jarred jalapeños because I have burned my skin with fresh ones in the past.  It makes a big bowl and it was all gone.  I served it with scoops.

This was quite good and a bit of a surprise to me.   I doubled the recipe, but I wouldn't of had to because this makes a lot.   It was just the right spice for me.   The sweetness of the mango was somewhat lost in this, but it worked great.   If I was going to change anything, I would double up on the mango, or maybe add in some pineapple chunks.   This recipe doesn't need it, but if I wanted more sweetness, that is what I'd do.

Absolutely one of my favorite recipes. Follow exactly unless you don't like a lot of garlic.  Find some fresh garden tomatoes and this will be your favorite salsa.

Sweet yet spicy with a kick.  Served with chips for a pre-barbecue but guests paired it with the grilled chili lime chicken for a delicious entree.  Definitely would make this again!

This salsa is very easy to make and it always turns out great, I have used it to dip chips and as a topping for meats, salads, and rice bowls.

I love this salsa!  I sometimes add a habanero to spicy it up even more....!  I also tend to leave out or use very little of the EVOO.  We love it!

I made this last Friday, and served it over grilled Grouper with yellow rice.  It was super!  Left over salsa is great with blue corn chips.:-)

This was fantastic served over crusted fish tacos. It was different and had a great taste & good flavors. I wasn't sure how my family would like it as it was different from our normal chunky guacamole that is our usual but, it turned out to be a home run for us. I made it an hour ahead and was asked to make this again. I highly recommend you try this.

Ole! Ole! Ole! I love this stuff.  I recommend doubling the mangoes and the avocados, as well as seeding the tomatoes, to make it less juicy.  If you have it, add 1/2 cup (or more) finely chopped pineapple.  This salsa makes everything taste more delicious!

All the colors make this salsa fun!  It is sweet, but not too sweet, and a little sassy!  I was surprised it contained olive oil.  I have never put olive oil in salsa before, but it works.

If I were to make this recipe again, I would add a little more garlic, chop the tomatoes much finer, and only use 3. I would add 1 more Mango and another avocado! When you get every ingredient together on a single chip or bite you can really pin point each flavor. It's a great way to practice your cuts :)

Will never let you down!!  Always better if you give it a bit of time (an hour or so) to sit.  I have never used the  Jalapeños and it has been awesome despite this.  I think it is also good as a garnish or side with steak.

My wife and I made these for fish and shrimp taco's on a nice day at the beach! My family loved them!

Drain a bit of the juices of the tomatoes out and we also kept a few jalapeno seeds .

This is delicious!!!! I put in less tomato just because I only had 2 people eating it, but, otherwise, I did exactly as it said.  (More tomato would have been delicious, too.) we ate it over fish and it was perfect! Definitely a keeper.

Super base recipe, but  I thought it needed a bit more kick.  I used 2 jalapeños and only 1 Tbl of olive oil (any more just seemed unnecessary).  With those changes I'd rate it a 5, I can't stop eating it!    Do let it rest before eating, and be sure to use a sturdy chip due to the chunks.  I like a nice solid blue corn chip for this one.

Tonight I made chicken, refried bean, and cheese quesadillas for the first time, and my husband requested salsa to go with it. So I looked up salsa recipes from the grocery store and jumped on this one. The only thing I changed was to eliminate the cilantro bc we just hate that herb, and eliminate the onion bc I'm just not an onion fan. Next time I'll only use two cloves of garlic bc it was pretty potent for us. But we both LOVED this salsa with our quesadillas and can't wait to use the salsa again tomorrow with more! This was super yummy! Definitely my favorite homemade salsa yet!!!

A huge hit at my dinner table!!! Made this to accompany the grilled Cod seasoned with Cajun seasoning! What a great compliment to each other! I'm not even a fish lover but with recipes like this I am certainly starting a love affair with fish! I would have to agree about adding more mango!

I make this recipe every summer, sometimes 2 x a week. Shared the recipe with lots of friends. You can just sit there and devour it! I use the yellow mangos, much sweeter and have a nice consistency, usually use 2 mangos.

I followed the recipe. I tripled the batch and split it into 2. For one of them I left it without peppers. The second one I finely chopped a Jalapeno and a habanero and incorporated it into the salsa and it is deliscious. I love garlic and use it heavily but beware this is quite a load of garlic. I can smell it through the tuperware. The flavor is perfect!!! It is a beautiful salsa and tastes wonderful!!

So far this is my favourite salsa recipe, but i use Lemon juice instead of lime juice, and it turns out very good. and I also add a little bit black pepper to spice it up, if you don't cut everything too small, it makes a very good salad also.

I made this recipe with one slight variation of adding a little more garlic and letting it sit (the flavors become more intense) for a few hours.  I actually submitted it in a Cinco de Mayo salsa contest and, out of 20 entries, it won both Best in Flavor and Best Overall.

I rarely review recipes, but this one is AMAZING. The mango, avocado, cilantro, red onion all pop with every bite. I made a batch of it and have eaten it for lunch the past 3 days. I want to lick the bowl, it's so good.

Great base.  I did add extra tomatoes, used a full lime (pulp, but not rind), and added in some pineapple just to sweeten it a bit.  Will be fun to play with this summer.

This was a hit!  I put in only a 1/4 of a small jalapeno pepper, the juice from a whole lime and 1.5 TB olive oil.  The mango was a bit too ripe so the salsa was a bit too mushy but that didn't stop anyone from giving it 5 stars.  Definitely making this again!!

Such a great blend of flavors. I leave out the olive oil and sometimes forget to put in the lime juice. I also add a can of black beans and 1/2 c. frozen corn as another reviewer suggested. I'm constantly asked for the recipe. Thanks for the great recipe!

Don't be afraid to add garlic or olive oil.  It is delicious.  I should have doubled the recipe.  I substituted green for jalapeno pepper.  Also, I added roasted corn to make salsa go further.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I personally use recipes just to give me an idea of what to make so I never follow them to a T. I changed the amount of cilantro, tomatoes , and jalapeños by half. I only used 2 cloves of garlic and used a teaspoon and a half of salt. I loved the mesh of the flavors on this one! Very summer/spring like.

Loved it! Followed the recipe exactly the first time and it turned out amazing! (one thing I did was I seeded the tomatoes so it wouldn't turn out runny like in the picture) The second time I made it I added 1/2 cup of sliced black olives. Also great! Will make this often!

I had some over ripe mangos given to me so instead of eating them as is, I decided to look up a recipe. Made this up just before some friends came over and they really loved it. I did too. Very, very tasty.

Excellent recipe as is or tweak to your liking.  Complaints were not spicy enough, I used jalapeno seeds and all.  Onion and cilantro which i love so I added more.  Mango I use the frozen which seem sweeter and easier to add.  Goes great with a homemade ranch with taco seasoning.

HUGE hit at every party I bring it to!  I like the salsa to be a bit more mango than tomato, so I evened out the use of the ingredients and it came out beautifully.  If you prefer hot salsa, I'd also recommend adding more jalapeno.

This is a great salsa. It was a bit time consuming to make, but very worth it! I just threw the jalapeno, garlic, and cilantro in the food processor to save some time. I also added extra jalapenos (I like it hot). I expected the salsa to be sweeter because of the mango (maybe bc the mango I used wasn't ripe enough), so I added some crushed pineapple from a can and it added just the right amount of extra sweetness! Next time, I may try adding a bit of corn as well, didn't have any on hand when I made it. I recommend getting rid of the seed goo/juice in the tomato before adding it to the salsa if you don't want it to be watery. I also used less garlic, I love garlic but even when I used 2 cloves, the taste of it is very strong.

Very tasty. I would add more jalapeno next time. I omitted the cilantro as we don't like it. Used it on top of grilled turkey burgers.

Delicious.  I didn't have any cilantro on hand, but I made it without and it was still great.  I cut the garlic to 1 clove as to not be too overpowering and decreased the olive oil to 2 TBS.  I did use the whole tsp of salt, but probably could cut that back a bit.  Overall, it was a huge hit.  We ate it with tortilla chips, but I can see it being great with fish or chicken too.  Definitely will make it again and again.

Excellent just as it is.  I had fresh basil from the garden and tried it instead of the cilantro.  It tastes yummy, too.

This is so good! It is my go to recipe whenever I need to bring something to a party. It's a great dip but can also be served and eaten as a salad. Also amazing in fish tacos. I always end up making a double batch and it's always gone. One word of warning -- depending on your knife skills, mine are mediocre, this takes a lot longer than 15 minutes to make. The smaller and more uniform the different elements are, the better. I am making it for the Superbowl tomorrow!

I doubled the recipe and left out the onion, as many of my friends don't like raw onion.  To lesson the severity of the jalapeno I put the mango, 4 tomatoes, the garlic,oil, lime juice, salt and the jalapeno in a food processor and blended it.  Then chopped the other mango, and the two avocados, and cilantro and it was perfect!!!

This is so addicting and refreshing!  I've made it four times this summer, and I don't get tired of it.  The first time, I served it over tilapia (salsa cold/tilapia hot - good summer combo).  The other three times, we used it with chips.  It is very pretty, and everyone thinks it tastes even better than it looks.  A fantastic thing to take to potlucks or to make for guests.  I've never rated anything on allrecipes, but this one is definitely a keeper!

This has become my basic salsa recipe. I did make a few changes. Instead of salt & cilantro, I used cilantro and chipotle bouillon cubes for seasoning, just 1 each. I also used 2 mangoes and no olive oil to cut down on the calories. Also, I did not seed my tomatoes because it is salsa, it is supposed to be juicy.

When I made this it actually turned out more like a mango guacamole.  I omitted the tomatoes, olive oil, and jalapeno pepper for different reasons.  Next time I will definitely be adding the pepper.  It needs a little heat to balance the sweetness of the mango.  I made a double batch and it was all gone by the end of the party!

I liked this better than I thought I would. Quite good. I've eaten it with tostito -yellow corn- chips for lunch and on white fish for dinner as recommended, and it went great. Really good salsa if you like avocados, tomato, and mango. (I'm not much for avocado, but wanted to try this recipe) It was different, but I'd say a well put together salsa!...LATER: it really grew on me; it's a week later and I'm going to make it again tonight. :D

I love avocado so I doubled up as suggested by some other reviewers and that may have been my problem with this recipe.  Although the taste was nice, it was not visually appealing.  Maybe my avocados were just too ripe but they coated all of the other ingrediants as I gently mixed the recipe.  The recipe was good but not good enough that I will look no further.

Excellent fresh flavors!  Cannot bring myself to eat cooked or bottled/canned salsa anymore... this is so much better.  I usually reduce the chuck size by mixing in a food processor very sparingly.  A little work but very worth the effort.  Don't forget to chill in the fridge for 20-30 min as it really helps to marry the flavors together.

Very good and light. But also mild.  Add more peppers/spices if you like it with at least a little kick.

Such a great refreshing salsa. I don't like things spicy so I left out the heat, but still tasted delicious. It makes a huge difference when your mango and avocado are perfectly ripe so if necessary, plan ahead since not all grocery stores carry ripe ones. I paired the salsa with pita chips either Stacy's Simply Naked or Parmesan Garlic, both worked nicely.

nice salsa, just way too labor intensive for me - esp. since i doubled the recipe.  if i were to make it again i'd add another mango cos that was a neat addition to the salsa and there's room for more of it.  thanks.

WARNING: DO NOT HANDLE JALAPENO PEPPERS WITHOUT GLOVES. This was my first attempt at any kind of salsa and I did not realize the severity of a Jalapeno burn. 6 hours later and I am still in a lot of pain.  The recipe turned out great but not worth it for me. Will handle with care next time!

Served this at a family gathering and it was the hit of the evening! I can't wait to serve again.  The sweetness of the mango goes perfectly with the spiciness of the onion and jalepeno.  This will become a staple for us I'm sure.

So perfect for summer. Actually I made a mistake and bought a fresh pineapple instead of a mango. Not wanting to go back to the store, I diced the pineapple small and added it to the mix. It was an excellent recipe to go with our fish tonight. I am having more (only about 3 hours after dinner) right now! Yum!

This Salsa is a beautiful thing. We broiled slices of french bread for about 3 minutes and served it on top- like a festive bruschetta! Also good as a sandwich between two slices of toast.

This recipe is the best fresh salsa recipe that I have ever made.  I mixed part of it with some chopped red lettuce, chopped fresh basil and mint.  I didn't need any dressing for my salad, this was perfect.  The rest I ate with the scoop tortilla chips. I added more jalapenos, less salt and oil like another reviewer suggested. It was great. This is a keeper.

I made this for a get together last weekend and I received rave reviews from everyone!  I even thought it was awesome and I don't even like mangos.  The only thing I done different was substitute garlic salt for the salt.  The longer it sat in the frig the better it became!  AWESOME!

WONDERFUL.  What a wonderful - fresh salsa.  I served this with AHI and it was fantastic.  I can't imagine having fish without this salsa as an accompaniment. Didn't change a thing except reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I made this 2 hours ahead to let the flavors all set in as well.

This is an awesome recipe... the only thing I changed was omitting the olive oil, I didn't see any need for it. Everything else was perfect together. I put this on fish tacos with chipotle sour cream, the spicy chipotle and sweet mango go together AMAZINGLY!!

Really good! I was looking for a salsa that was more on the sweet or tropical side to serve with pulled pork tacos. This was a delicious compliment to them and was equally good with just chips! I added orange bell pepper (omitted jalapeno), a donut peach and kiwi(for added sweetness) and an extra avacado. I also left out cilantro since my husband does not like it. I will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It isn't one of my absolute favorites but I've been looking for a healthy munching snack and here it is. It has wonderful flavor, and is very unique. I like garlic, but next time I will cut it way back because it seemed to over take the dish instead of compliment it. The only unhealthy thing in this dish is the salt, so don't add it. It doesn't need it. I also zested the lime into the salsa and added much more than 2 Tbs. of lime juice.  I'm almost embarrassed to say that this dish introduced me to one of my new favorite fruits. I never had a mango before trying this salsa. They are fantastic. I didn't quite know how to prepare one, so I did what any modern woman would do. I googled it. If you need some help in this area too try this YouTube site http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd7onfkw1iU&feature=related  Thanks for the great healthy recipe Fhiveshot.

Great dip- my two year old nephew loved it! I should have diced my ingredients smaller- because the chips kept breaking - but still delicious.

Loved this recipe!  Talk about good for you too.  My husband doesn't usually like combinations with salty and sweet foods and he loved it.  I didn't change a thing.

I'm glad I doubled the recipe.  There was a little left over so I put it on a couple of grilled chicken breasts the next night.  I forgot to buy cilantro, I'm sure it would've been even better with Cilantro.  It was a little time consuming to chop everything up.

I had a party for 5 people and on the advice of previous reviewers, tripled the recipe. Woah, nelly! There were a lot of leftovers. This is a time consuming recipe due to all of the chopping that is necessary. Next time I will make it the night before as I found it was better to let the flavors combine overnight. It was a huge hit. Enjoy!

This is a really good salsa, and pretty adaptable. I sometimes leave out the avocado, or substitute a can of drained and rinsed black beans. I also only use a drizzle of olive oil (maybe 1 or 2 teaspoons) instead of 3 tablespoons, and it's plenty.

My first try at making mango salsa. I usually make the normal New Mexico style salsa. I Love this recipe! Everyone who tried this loved it. They said it was the best they've ever had. It goes great on tacos, too.

This is THE BEST salsa recipe I have ever made/tried.  I have made it several times for family and friends and the bowl is always empty by the end of the night.  I am always asked for the recipe (and if we have any more in the fridge).  5+ STARS!!!

This salsa is amazing!  When we made this recipe (multiplying the quantity) we ended up with such a large amount we thought no one could ever eat that much salsa.  By the end of the night the bowl was scraped clean.  This is a great recipe to try!

I had been passing this recipe up because the combination of tomato and mango sounded gross to me. I finally decided to give it a try and I'm SO glad I did. I found out I didn't have any fresh cilantro on hand so instead I used a tablespoon of dry which I mixed with the lime juice and oil and then mixed in with the rest. What a great combination of sweet/salty and spicy! I served it with sliced chicken and brown rice. I'll be making this again and again!

I've made this several times and it's always a hit.  We generally just serve it with tortilla chips - or just eat it with a spoon.

great flavor. Made it a couple of different times over the holidays and everyone raved. The mango and cilantro makes it fresh and flavorful but not sweet. The lime juice keeps the avacado nice and fresh. Although you can make it ahead of time the chopping is VERY time consuming and is a real negative to the recipe, but the enjoyment is worth it!

Wow, I wish I could give this ten stars!  I made the recipe almost exactly, leaving out the cilantro since I'm not a big fan and didn't have any on hand and using just three tomatoes since that's what I had.  I served this over some grilled chicken and corncakes and was licking the plate!

Awesome Salsa! I forgot to get Cilantro at the store, but it was still delish without it. I think next time I will remember the cilantro and use 2 avocado's instead of one.

My all-time favorite summer dip. I have been making this for a couple of years and it is awesome. I usually double the recipe and my husband and I can still finish off the whole bowl. I have even had this over grilled chicken and it is fantastic! Great recipe!!

This was wonderful and delicious!  My only suggestion is to refrigerate the salsa longer than the 30 minutes - it's much better colder, in my opinion.

I was a little skeptic that this would make a good salsa recipe, BUT let me say, this is the BEST thing I have tasted!! The flavors compliment each other so well!! I accidentally made enough for 10 people, but it was well worth the time it took to prepare.  

Note*** You dont have to cut the avacados up very much at all. They sort of mush together with everything else.

This was good.  I used a serrano pepper b/c that was all I had and it was spicy!  This was very good.  It did not keep well in the refrigerator though - I would recommend making a small batch if you don't have a lot of people eating it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I cannot count the number of times I've made this recipe.  Whenever I go somewhere, or have people over - I make it.  The combination of the tangy mango and cilantro flavour with the mild flavour of the avocado is absolutely delicious.

This salsa is absolutely FABULOUS!!!  We had it on my bland leftover porkchops and it jazzed it up perfectly!  All of my picky children loved it with tortilla chips.  The other reviewers were right about doubling the recipe, this is definitely a new family favorite. Thanks!

My husband really wanted some mango salsa and this recipe was great! It had a wonderful flavor.  I hand chopped everything and didnt use onions. I think I'll try this recipe without the avacado to see how it works, since the avacado does turn a little brown.

I am trying to be more adventerous and am trying to eat things that I haven't before.  I was afraid to make this...I have never cut up a jalapeno or avacado before and don't even really like avacado's.  I was even more afraid to taste this salsa when it was done and it is totally delicious!!  I made this exactly as directed.  I love the fresh lime juice in it and will be serving this salsa to many people to come!!  :)

Yummy, this was perfect. The only thing I did was add a sprinkle of paprika! It was good with some feta sprinkled on top too (I did not add it to the full mixture) I will be making this a lot come spring and summer time! Served it with wholewheat chips.

Fantastic salsa recipe! I used canned tomatos, so I only used 1 tsp olive oil, and the consistency was perfect.  This recipe is great for a party anytime of year!

Soo good!! I served it as condiment to my Taqueria Style Tacos - Carne Asada (from this website) but next time I would increase the amount of chili since we like our salsa really spicy spicy :) thank you!

I think I did something wrong as it didn't turn out well. Not a hit at the potluck I brought it to either.

I received a lot of compliments for this Salsa. I didnt use a jalapeno pepper, but used cayenne pepper. And I used a sweet onion instead of red. It was more time consuming than I thought, but it turned out great. Very colorful presentation.

I love this salsa. I didn't put in the avacado, and I majorly decreased the jalapeno. It is absolutely delicious. It tastes similar to a mango salsa that I love to buy from Costco

This is the best salsa recipe I've ever eaten.  I shared it with a friend and she wanted the recipe then passed it on to one of her friends who also wanted the recipe after tasting it.  It is so fresh and great with tortilla chips.

Great recipe. I just made this a few days ago at my son's luau birthday party.. Extremely huge hit. I did double the recipe and add 2 extra mangos, but only used 3 large tomatoes total and it came out perfect. Will definitely make again and again.

This was delicious-doubled it for a luau and it was gone instantly. I added some chunk pineapple to it as well. Will make again for sure.

Very Good!  I marinated everything except the avocado overnight, adding it 30 min. before serving.  I took it to school for teacher appreciation day and was asked for multiple copies of the recipe.  Thankyou for the great recipe!

This was an incredibly tasty recipe.  The cilantro and the mango go together so nicely.  I cut back on the salt and the oil and it still tastes great.  I will make this recipe again (many times).

I've seen this reviewed quite a bit recently so had to give it a try. It was well worth a trip to the supermarket for the ingredients.I only used one clove of garlic and just eyeballed the coriander. None of us could get enough of this. Many thanks.

Absolutely Delicious!  Just made this for a family pot-luck and it was a hit.  In fact, I'm off to get more mangoes to make more for tomorrow!  I left out the olive oil and garlic and made enough for 20 people...fast, easy and rave reviews...thank you for sharing your recipe!!!
