This is the first time I've ever made sausauge out of any kind of meat, and it turned out wonderful.  The flavor was perfect.  I made a platter full of these for my 5 boys, and not one was left over. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh venison at the time, so resorted to frozen. That's the only reason I didn't give my attempt 5 stars. The patties were delicious, but Im sure they would have been even better with fresh venison. The left-over patties were delicious in hamburgers too. I'll use the same recipe in the future for moose and caribou, it was that good.

It was alright, I added 1/4t cayenne & 1/2t red crushed peppers. I like things with a little spice.

The firt attempt at making this sausage I ended up with venison hamburgers with bacon. The second time I put everything in the food processor, added a jalapeno, and doubled the spices (the venison overpowered everything the first time). I feel that it was still lacking some fat could be my ground venison.

I just ate the first test patty and it was some of the best sausage I have tried. I like some spice so I added some crushed red pepper flakes and some ground cayenne pepper ( I didnt measure the amount just what looked like it would add a kick). I will be making huge batches to pass out to family and friends. My mouth is watering just writing the review. Thanks for posting this one.

This looks really good..pretty much what I was looking for in a recipe. I found a few from a couple of wild game cookbooks, but I think this tops them! I will probably follow the other reviews and spice it a little more, but looks good! Thanks!

This did not end up with enough fat content to taste like a traditional breakfast sausage.  That being said it was pretty good and is a great idea, the spices need to be increased to taste, also I think a touch of brown sugar would be a nice addition.

Had some frozen hind quarter.  After it was thawed, I chopped it up with the appropriate ratio of bacon, mixed in the spices and put it through the grinder.  It smelled really great but when we cooked it up, I was a little under-whelmed.  I couldn't really taste any of the spices, it just tasted like venison burger with some bacon in it.   I should have read the reviews and would definitely recommend doubling the spices (including the salt) and adding something like red pepper flakes and cayenne.  I have made a lot of other pork sausages, never a venison one before so maybe my expectations are off but it ended up bland to me.

I shared your recipe with the guys at work. They graded it 3.5 - 4 stars. They all liked it but their biggest suggestion was to spice it up a bit more.

Easy to make sausage that has great flavor. I doubled the recipe and used a pretty fatty pound of smoked bacon. I ran the bacon through the grinder and then pushed the venison through. I also added a heaping 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper.

Delicous. I used it to make sausage gravy for biscuits. It was fantastic, and my husband won't stop talking about how much he liked it. I will definitely be making again.

This is an excellent recipe for sausage.  I like the flavor of the meat with the ingredients.  I freeze the bacon before trying to mince it.  After it is minced I then let it thaw, before mixing it.

This was good but even though I doubled the seasonings as suggested by other reviewers it did not have much sausage flavor.  I did omit the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes because my husband does not like a lot of spice.  I think that in this case it needs that extra  kick.  I plan to try it again and not leave anything out.  We liked it well enough to experiment with it until I get it right.

This sausage is pretty good! The bacon flavor does take over a little and I would add more cayenne but ill make it again with less bacon.

This was my first attempt at cooking with venison. My bacon wasn't minced fine enough. Yet the flavor was pretty good. Next time I will double the sage and add a bit of cayenne pepper.
