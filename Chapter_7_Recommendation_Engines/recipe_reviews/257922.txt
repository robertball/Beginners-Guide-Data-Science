These  oatmeal cream pies won't disappoint! They are chewy, sweet and delicious.  They are not identical to store bought oatmeal cream pies but they are close and taste even better.  Two changes I made  where to  substitute honey for the molasses and light brown sugar instead of dark only because I didn't have these ingredients. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the filling because mine turned our too runny.  After  I made the cookies into sandwiches I put them in the fridge to firm up the filling since the tops were starting to slide a bit.  I also recommend baking the cookies on parchment lined baking sheets.  My cookies were too soft to let cool on wire racks so  I let them cool and firm on the cookie sheet and then moved then to the wire racks.

These were killer amazing !   My kids are teenagers and everyone gobbled them up.   The filling was absolutely perfect, exactly what I was looking for.  Soft and fluffy and so yummy.    I would say keep refrigerated as author suggests, but take them out about 20 minutes before serving.  I wrapped mine individually in waxed paper like candies and twisted the ends.  The neighbors loved them too.  Definitely going to make these again and again.  I would have posted a photo, but they disappeared so fast. Great recipe!
