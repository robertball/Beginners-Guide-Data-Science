Good, but needed a bit more liquid and a bit more sweetness to counter the tart. Really nice on the pork, though.

Excellent!  It turned out a little too "hot" for me, so I added a little apple sauce at the last minute, but it has fabulous flavor! Used it on Chef John's grilled pork chops - so moist & delicious! You've GOT to try this! Easy & well worth the time. (oh - I 1/2'd the salt in the brine of the chops, but could still taste it...)

i was a little worried when i was making this as it smelled really vinegary (and i love vinegar) but it came out great on the molasses brined pork chops!  however, non-vinegar lovers beware - this might not be the sauce for you.

Whew, can only say that a tablespoon each of red pepper flakes and black pepper made this way too hot for this house!  We're about in the middle on spicy foods, and my gut was telling me that this was going to be too hot, but I hate to modify a recipe too much the first time through.  The reviews were Interesting, too, because the spiciness didn't seem to be as much of an issue as the strong vinegar flavor...maybe we really are wimps!  I had no issue with the vinegar, this is "Carolina-style" which traditionally has more of a potent vinegar flavor.  Unless you like your food smokin' hot, I'd recommend that you start with a teaspoon, taste, and then add more red pepper flakes and black pepper as you see fit.  You can always add more, but once it's in there, you can't take it out.  I had a container of Kaluha Pig in the freezer, so I added this sauce for some pulled-pork sandwiches.

Used on his brined pork chops and tuna steaks. Good on both.  I thought the pork was a bit salty from the brine even after rinsing the meat before cooking. Sauce smelled of vinegar but did not taste like vinegar after grilling. I did not use all the hot pepper flakes, just sounded like a bit much. Used about half and thought it was hot enough. It was good enough I will try again.

Tried it both with Chef Johns brined chops and my own Carolina style pulled pork from a slow cooker, both were complemented very nicely with this sauce.

I have made this several times, so yes I really like it.  Many guests find it too spicy, so I offer the pulled pork, this sauce, and a sweet smoky sauce that I donâ€™t care much for.  Most mix the two along with the broth.  For me, keeping this sauce separate means I get to enjoy it as I matures for a night or two.

Followed the recipe exactly, extremely spicy and sauce was more pasty than liquid.  Had to add more apple cider vinegar and a little guava syrup for more sweetness.  If I make this again, I'll increase the apples and brown sugar and go lighter on the pepper.

Wow! A little to spicy for us. I made this to accompany the molasses grilled pork chops and quite frankly felt they did not need the sauce. The sauce was good with the pork just to spicy for this household.

Very spicy, just how I like it. Next time, though, I think I'll use less mustard.

Followed the recipie for this and it was ok on my pulled pork sandwich but had it just on some of the meat and it was close to inedibile. Was way too much vinegar taste. I used mothers all natural apple cider vinegar had i used 1/2 the amt and finished it with apple cider juice or even water it may have been good. I tried to save it by adding more brown sugar and some molases to it but ended up dropping it down the disposal.

Very Good!  Will make this again.  Kids thought it was a bit too spicy, but I  say "crazy good".  Served over a pork shoulder that cooked all day in the crock.  Thanks for sharing.

This ended up great but was too vinegary initially so I had to add more sugars to smooth it out.  In the end, it was awesome with pork chops!  I used the molasses brine for the chops: tennnnnnder!
