This was very good! I can't help but laugh when reviewers give a recipe 1 or 2 stars and say it wasn't good, then you read that they subbed ingredients for everything!  For example reviewer who used biscuits instead.  Don't give it a bad rating if you didn't even come close to following the recipe.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit. I also made some changes to the basic recipe. Instead of having to wait for bread to thaw, I used 3 tubes of Pillsbury Buttermilk bisquits and cut each one in half. I just sprinked the parmesan cheese between the layers so I used more than 1/2 cup. Overall, it was an appetizer and dessert for some of the family. Thanks! It was great!!!

I found this recipe to be simple and delicious...with a few modifications.

First, make sure to grease the top edge of the pan, even on the outside to keep the rolls from sticking (as they will rise above the top). Also place a piece of foil in the bottom of the oven to catch spills.

I used Rhodes frozen dinner rolls and only one egg, omitted the salt, added a stick of butter and a tablespoon of minced garlic (in addition to the garlic powder), made sure to chop the green onions and parsley extra fine, and used 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan, 1/4 cup Colby/Jack and 1/4 cup Mozzarella cheeses. I blended all ingredients together in one bowl and dipped each ball into the mixture -- there was just enough.

After baking for 20 minutes, I placed a piece of foil over the top of the pan and baked 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.

Since the recipe doesn't specify what you do after baking I did the following:

Remove pan from oven, immediately inverting it onto a plate, loosen the rolls from the pan and allow it all to sit for about 10 minutes before removing the pan from over the rolls. Sprinkle the top with 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan and lay a piece of foil (loosely) over the top for about 10 minutes so the cheese will melt. Allow to cool completely (uncovered).

I found it best to slice individual cake-sized pieces to create a cheese swirled bread. I served this with my own version of the trending "Pizza Casserole" and it was a huge hit! I will definitely make it again!

I have tried the recipe with the eggs and without. I think mostly they make the rest of the ingredients work to stick to the dough. The stated amount of garlic powder makes a mild garlic flavor and it smells wonderful coming out of the oven! Check after the stated 30 minute cooking time, mine was still gooey dough in the middle so I put foil over the top and  cooked longer.

I'm like all the others...ADD MORE GARLIC... I make dough in my bread machine. Also add more mixture to dip it in. I also used more parmesan cheese. This was really good, so I suggest you make it.I will be making this recipe often.

i omitted the salt, added more garlic powder, butter and minced fresh garlic. I needed twice the dipping ingredients, and even though I greased the pan mine stuck. 
Taste wise good, but could have used more of something, garlic? parsley??. Overall, 
good recipe, with a bit of tweaking.

I make this and brought it to our office pot luck lunch. Everyone raved about it. I made a 2 pound loaf of white bread dough in the breadmaker, on the dough cycle. The seasonings were just right, and so was cooking time. It stuck to the pan, but came out intact. I'd make it again.

This was so easy and very delicious... kids gobbled it up and requested leftovers for their lunchboxes! I used frozen bun dough, divided in half, and put them into two loaf pans.  This is definately a keeper.

This recipe was great.  The family loved it and it was very simple.  I think next time I might add a little more garlic.

Not as good as it sounds will not make again.  All that butter ruined my bundt pan. As it was cooking the butter mixture seeped through leaving more mess than it was worth.  Taste was blah and the half hour to cook made the bread over done.
WILL NOT MAKE AGAIN.

Made thi sin my bundt pan.  I coul dnot find bread dough at the store, so I used frozen Parkerhouse rolls instead.  Good choice, as I only had to break each piece in half.  I used up all the dipping ingredients long before I was done assembling.  Need at least 1/2 more than recipe states.  I also added 2 tsp garlic powder and it could have used more. Next time, I will dip each piece inthe butter mixture, then roll in parmesan cheese. However, the presentation in the middle of the table was great!  Everyone enjoyed "picking" their bread off the ring! Thanks for the recipe!

This was terrific. I made a couple changes: omitted scallions; doubled the butter and garlic powder. I used frozen dinner rolls and cut roughly into fourths. After whisking together eggs, seasoning and melted butter, I tossed the bread balls in the mixture until all were coated and then tossed in the Parmesan. I split the recipe into two very well greased loaf pans. The crusty top and edges are the best!!

Good, but somewhat dry. I made a glaze using 3Tbs. melted butter, 1 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 Tbsp. parmesan cheese, which I drizzled over the top just before serving. It really improved it. I will definately make this again.

I live in a very small town, so I have trouble finding a lot of ingredients.  Can someone please tell me which "frozen bread dough loaves" I'm supposed to get???  And if I can't get it here, can anyone recommend an alternative to this? I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!

My family tried this recipe this evening and we were not impressed.  It needs more garlic, more dipping sauce, less green onions and a shorter cook time at a lower temprature.  This would be great with some oregano in the mixture and to leave out the green onions.

I wasn't very impressed with my results-the bread seemed bland to me. Then again, maybe I've just grown a high tolerance for garlic! If I make it again, I will increase the parmesean cheese and add granulated garlic to the butter mixture as well.

This recipe is some!  The only thing I did differently is I used Rhodes frozen rolls (thawed) and dried chives since I didn't have any green onions on hand.  I will be making this recipe again!

As written it is good, but we did feel it needed a bit more garlic & salt. I did add some cheddar cheese but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It went over well for Valentine's Day. Will be making again and adding fresh minced garlic and a tad more salt. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent idea: I like it! However, I wanted the primary flavor to be garlic, not scallions. I applied the triple garlic technique devised by ATK for garlic mashed potatoes.  A handful of garlic, pressed and poached in the butter; several cloves ground with salt into a paste; and a couple small cloves pressed raw into the cooled savory mix. I swapped scallion for 1 Tbl chopped rosemary to keep the color but change the flavor. Marvelous! I heart ATK!  I also changed butter to 50/50 with a mild olive oil. Next time, I'll use all olive oil, as I felt the butter clashed and overwhelmed the cheese and savory ingredients.  I think I'll prefer a "ciabatta"-like experience.  I'll set aside the time to use my sourdough starter for the bread.  Still, the recipe as written is very good.  Thank you for posting it.

Not near enough flavor for me but then I like LOTS of flavor. I followed the recipe and didn't add or change anything but I was so disappointed and I hate to write a bad review. Just wondering what I could have done wrong because there are so many good reviews.

This has been a REALLY BIG hit at the 3 parties I have made this for.  Cooking time seems to vary; I set my timer for 25 min and checked it every couple of minutes until I felt it was done. If you really like a lot of garlic, add more.  I make it as is.  Another party goer brought a buffalo chicken dip and this dipped in that is sensational!

I have made this bread several times and everyone loves it.  I make it even easier by mixing everything in at once.  After the butter and eggs are in the bowl the balls of bread don't stick together anyway.  I add small chunks of Sharp Cheddar (cut back on the parm if I do,)  and it melts through the bread, but stays "melty."  I sometimes add fresh diced jalepenos to give a little extra zing.  This is always a welcomed dish:)

If you want the butter and herbs to stick to the dough better, cut dough while it is still frozen!  Cold dough solidifies the butter/herb combination thicker.  Let rise then bake.  AMAZING.

This recipe worked wonderfully, with one change. Based on other reviews, I doubled the amount of garlic powder used (I used granulated garlic), but it was still not quite garlicky enough for my taste.  I would probably add a clove of pressed garlic to the mixture to really kick it up a notch.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!  Served with aged. slow roasted prime rib, ceasar salad with homemade dressing, and brussel sprouts braised in heavy cream and nutmeg.  Between 6 adults there was only 1 small piece left.

This was fabulous! I was in a time-crunch and had forgotten to thaw the frozen bread loaf, so I used two cans of refrigerated French Bread dough (the kind that is next to the cinnamon rolls and pre-made cookie dough at the store). Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and it was perfect!! We used large chunks of it as our "dinner roll" with our Thanksgiving meal and everyone said it was delicious!!!

This is a good recipe, but I have a couple of hints. Don't leave out the salt. Bread needs salt. Use good cheese.

Very good! I made this exactly as written except for putting a little shredded mozarella cheese on top before letting rise before baking. I think next time I will add a little more salt to the egg mixture, but other than that this was a delicious and beautiful bread! I made it in my heart shaped tube pan for Valentine's Day dinner and it was perfect! I will be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't have time to use actual bread so I picked up biscuits in a tube. I used 2-8oz cans with the dipping sauce this recipe calls for. I didn't add as much parsley and it could use a tad more garlic (we're garlic heads here).

I thought this recipe was really yummy. :)
The first time I had it to high in the oven and it cooked the top nice, but the insides were not quite done.  I also forgot to spray the pan, so it did stick.  But everyone ate what they could and loved it.
The second time I put in on the bottom rack for the recommended time and then moved it to the top rack for another 10 minutes to brown the top.  My family loves garlic so I used more than the recommended amount.  We also use a garlic blend, so I didn't add salt.  There could have been a little more mixture to roll the balls into, but we scraped by with what was made.  We didn't have plain parmesan on hand, so we used a 5 cheese blend and it worked great.  My mother-in-law even wanted the recipe.

Thank you!

This was a total hit with the office party. I used a liberal dose of real shredded parmesean, and it was fantastic! Did not need any butter or spreads.

This recipe is AMAZING!!  I have made it multiple times.  I of course added a little bit extra of all the "good stuff".  I have served this bread with steak, thai food, chicken, and stews.  It goes great with it all.

Needs more garlic powder or some fresh garlic.  Other than that it was tasty and pretty.  The kids thought it was a treat to pull their own bread.

This bread turned out to be okay. I used 2 cans of refrigerated bisuits instead of the frozen bread. I also added 2 tsp. of garlic powder. I think this recipe called for too much butter because in the middle of the bread I could see the excess butter floating on top of the bread. This is a good recipe,but I think next time I will use less butter. Other than that the bread was very tasty!

The first time I tried this recipe I followed the directions exactly and used the white bread dough...it was OK but not great.  On the second try I took the hint by VICKI-M and used 3 tubes of Buttermilk biscuits instead of the white bread dough and found it much more flavorful.  Great with spaghetti or lasagna.

This simple recipe turned out to be exceptionally delicious.  We pretty much followed recipe as is except for baking at a slightly lower temperature for 30 min longer.  Opposite to what some people said, I actully ended up with extra dipping mixture and poured that mixture over the bread.  I think that's why I had to bake it for longer, but it made it super tasty.  I used vegetable oil instead of butter to make it healthier.  The bread tasted best when it was fresh out of oven.  It tasted slightly oily the next day, but still delicious.  For the healthier eaters out there, choose a healthy bread dough makes a difference.

I have made this recipe many times.  My family is not crazy about onions, so I omit the white part of the onion.  I also use a clove of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  You can use frozen bread dough, but I prefer Rhodes frozen dinner rolls.  Don't use refrigerated biscuit dough, the results are subpar IMHO.  Enjoy!

Soooo good.  I served this with pasta and doubled the parmesan.  You can add any herbs you like and it turns out excellent.  If you don't have the right pan just use a regular pie pan and put a mason jar in the middle of it.

This was a great accompaniment to our Christmas dinner.  I worried that people would think that it was weird to pull bread apart with your hands at a nice holiday meal, but it was not a concern.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!

Delicious! Made it for thanksgiving and the family loved it. I used 2 dozen frozen rolls and cut them in half and I omitted the green onion as some family members are picky. Was terrific and next time I will add the green onion and use aged cheddar for something a little different

This is quite a treat! I used a recipe from this site to make the dough. ( best bread machine bread) I used regular bread pans and it worked just fine. I've made it several times now using different spices and cheeses, and it is fantastic every time. Thanks for the recipe...

This was so great! I use a shallow pan that didn't have the hole in the middle and mine didn't turn out cooked in the middle either. So the next time I used a bunt pan and it was perfect! My husband and I make this when we cooked Italian food and it goes great togther. I even gave my dog some and she gobbled it up! Lol!! But it is so good.

We were disappointed with this bread. It didn't have much taste and it stuck to the pan (even though I greased it). We won't be making this again. Sorry.

I'm sorry but this recipe just bombed for me.  Maybe I did something wrong but I found it lacked flavor and the bread dried out.  I'm not sure if using the eggs had anything to do with it, since the recipe didn't specify small, medium or large eggs.  I usually buy large eggs, so maybe that was part of the problem.  I might give this recipe another try only using smaller eggs next time because I'm reluctant to just write it off as a bad recipe.  I think with a few adjustments (like adding more garlic, using freshly grated parmesan reggiano, even some cracked black pepper and smaller eggs maybe) it might be pretty good.

It was OK, but I do not think I will make again.  A lot of work with moderate results.  I followed recipe and did not substitute any ingredients.

Had it for a week night, and it was quick and easy enough: our meal revolved around it, with some meat and cheese, so everyone was free to decide what to accompany it with. I prepared yhe dough with my bread machine, and I set the timer so to have it ready exactly when I was opening my door, coming from work.
That means I only had to put the whole thing together, just whisking a couple of eggs and herbs, quick enough. I followed the recipe to a T, as I usually do the first time, just to be fair; I did wonder about oregano, as parsley didn't give any kick to it according to me. I probably increased the amount of parmesan, but I'm glad I did it, it was not overpowering at all. Next time I'm going to let it rise more, and also to use olive oil instead of butter, which only adds graesiness and can be omitted in my opinion. All in all, will do it again, the kids thought it was a kind of quiche with a hole in the middle...

My daughter is in culinary school - she couldn't wait to make this recipe - however, she made bread dough from scratch and didn't put cheese in between the layers.  She also used a bit more herbs and spices.  It was phenomenal!

Great basic recipe! I added  3 TSP of minced garlic because we love garlic  but that was the only modification I made. Yummo!! Next time I may add some mozzarella or cheddar. Possibilities are endless!!

My family loved it, said I could make it again next week. Followed comments and doubled garlic, that helped. Also doubled dipping mix. For me it was too much dipping sauce and tossed a lot of it. For some reason, it didn't pull apart like we thought, but that didn't stop my boys. They just ripped away.

This is a great base but I had to make too many changes to give it a higher rating. I didnt use frozen dough, I whipped up a batch of "Sy's Challah" from this site. I also omitted the green onion/eggs, used minced garlic instead of the powder and had to up the butter to approx 1/2 cup as what was listed wasnt nearly enough. I made two for a dinner party and everyone gobbled them up!

This was good, I added about 1 teaspoon of chopped garlic to the recipe.  Next time I'll make the pieces of dough bigger, the size of golf balls 'cause all those little pieces were a lot of trouble for the end result... it does turn out into one big chunk.

I thought this was good. Other folks really liked it. I did a tb. of garlic powder, and used garlic salt instead of regular salt. I also added a tb. of Herbs de Provence. Next time I will add more garlic (chop some real garlic) and make sure to flour the pan instead of just greasing.

We made an Italian feast for Fathers Day and I wanted to serve Garlic bread and another variety of bread.  This was such a hit!  Not only was it delicious, it gave a great presentation when being served.  The only thing I did different was replace fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder.  Thanks!

This recipe was great although I added more ingredients along with what the recipe calls for I added oregano, chili peppers, red onion instead of green onions and pepper I also used allot more garlic. I found 30 min. was not enough cooking time so I covered it with foil after 30 min and cooked it for 45 min. I will be making this bread again my family loved it!

This was disappointing. It didn't turn out very good. I thought it sounded strange to use green onion, but I tried it anyway. I didn't like the taste of the onion mixed with the garlic, butter and parsley. I might try doing this again, but with some modifications. It seemed like a great idea.

It was great! I didn't have the time to individually dip each piece so I just tossed them all together. I would suggest cutting a tad smaller, because then each bite will have more garlic glaze on iy. So yummy.

I tried this last night.  It was great.  I used frozen rolls and thawed them enough to cut in half, drenced them in the egg mixture and let them rise in a pre-heated and turned off 200 degree oven.  I used garlic powder and instead of salt, I used garlic-parsley salt. I served this with a homemade vegetable soup. This would be fun to experiment with--maybe use another kind of cheese, make it a sweet roll with brown sugar and nuts or raisins?

I thought this recipe was very good, although I forgot to add the parmesan cheese, which would have made them even better. I used a angel food cake pan and put in on a cookie sheet so nothing would leek out. The only problem I had was that when I took the bread out of the pan it did not keep its shape, all the little dough balls seperated. Not one stuck to each other, or the pan for that matter. But, I would still make these again, without forgetting the parmesan cheese.

This was awesome! I made two loaves of bread just with the mixture spread on top of the risen frozen bread dough, then the next time I made it the pull-apart way. I only used one roll of frozen bread dough (halving the dipping mixture), which was nice because it cooked through quickly, but we wanted more to eat since it turned out so good! The only other change I made was to omit the green onions.

This recipe is great! I layered mine with Parmesan and cheddar cheese. I also cooked some fresh Jalepenos in some butter and layered it with those also! It turned out really good!

This sounded so good I made it with my own bread dough without reading the reviews.  Too bad, as it was very disappointing.  It stuck to the bundt pan and looks a mess.  Nothing special about the flavour either.  I'll be heading over to the supermarket to pick up some garlic bread to serve withour chili.

I really liked the ease of using the frozen bread dough in this recipe.  That was about all I liked.  There was almost no taste, like eating a warm biscuit.  I really want this recipe to work though.  I will definitely try it again with some additional ingredients. I think it would help to use fresh grated parmesan and minced garlic.

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. I couldn't see using all that butter so I reduced it quite a bit and used biscuits instead of frozen bread dough. The flavor turned out pretty blah and some of the gooey egg mixture in the center did not get thoroughly cooked. It wasn't too pleasant pulling bread apart and finding raw egg in the center! I think I'll stick to traditional cinnamon Monkey Bread next time.

I have made this many times.  My family loves it.  I left off the green onions and have experimented with different cheeses.   Our favorite is asiago.  My son makes it for his friends.

I used white and wheat dough (more colorful and the texture  and taste is different). I didn't use green onions, my husband has acid reflex, instead I used powdered onion.  I used more garlic. I think next time I will use bread pans to cook it in, in the future (the middle of large baking dish wasn't done).

This recipe is amazing! I did what another user suggested and cut it semi frozen into pieces and dipped frozen pieces into the mix and let it rise that way. I also added mozz cheese! So so good! My family loved it

I made this by making the dough in my bread machine, making the dough balls and freezing them.  Then when we went to our annual cabin get together I brought  the dry ingredients premeasured.  The dough had thawed and I assembled quickly.  Beautiful  it went great with my premade lasagna and with a little  freezer dinner prep the weekend before I had a easy dinner for 10 without missing out on the visiting.  I followed the  recipe except using fresh dried chives and sprinkling mozzarella in the layers.  What a hit.  Everyone raved.  It is a staple in my box now.

Not enough flavor, plus the eggs, though mixed thoroughly into the butter, separated and "scrambled" on the bottom of the bundt pan!

Wow!  did this not work out for us.  I didn't have an issue with not having enough mix to coat the bread balls, but I did have a huge issue with it not coming out the pan which I greased the heck out of and so of course it wasn't very pretty to look at. Also, there just really wasn't much in the way of flavor.  Hardly anyone had more than one bite and I just threw most of it away.

Turned out well with biscuit dough. It was a hit with the pizza sauce. I would add more garlic next time and will try with actual bread dough

My husband is REAL finicky about his food and especially about garlic bread. HE LOVES THIS BREAD! He asked me just 2 days ago to make it  again.  And so I am. Right after I submit this review. He RARELY asks for repeats of 'new' recipes, so is speaking volumes that he actually asks me to make it again. And again. And again. I kid you not. Y'all NEED to have this one on a regular rotation.

Ok, I didn't have any green onion. I used 2 cans of  Pillsbury Grands Buttermilk Biscuits. I left the biscuits whole and just sliced them in the center. I dipped the first can of biscuits in the butter mixture & put them in my bundt pan. I sprinkled cheddar cheese and Parmesean then on them & more butter then I put the 2nd can of biscuits on top. Added more cheddar & Parmesean and drenched it with butter. I sprinkled extra garlic powder on top. This was the best garlic bread I've ever tasted. The ones at Red Lobster can't compare. Thank you.

This was a bit like garlic knots, which my kids love.  I did add some fresh garlic in addition to the garlic powder, and I only managed to make 1-1/2 layers. which was fine.  I'll make it again.

Really good bread. I used frozen dinner rolls that were slow to rise after 45 minutes. I put them in the oven anyway and they turned out perfectly.

Extremely easy and awesomely delicious! I did not have garlic powder so I substituted with about a tablespoon of minced garlic (the kind that you can buy in a tube). I also used a parmesan romano cheese mix. Came out smelling delicious and did not taste too garlic-y. 

Because I did not have a bundt pan, I used a crock-pot (just the removable ceramic part) and cut the bread into slices. I did not have to grease the pot and the bread pulled away from the walls without any problems. 

Next time, I will have to make the balls smaller so the butter and cheese gets more distributed throughout the bread.

This was good...... I had to cook it for 30 min and then cover with foil to cook another 30min. I used frozen dinner roll dough and a bundt pan. Brushed the top with melted butter. Yum!

I didn't have enough of the butter/egg mixture for both loaves--only about one-and-a-half, so I will double next time.  And, yes, as a garlic lover, needs lots more garlic!

I found it lacking in its buttery flavor, and not overly flavorful. I gave it three stars, though, due to its ease in making and the attractiveness of the dish when served.

Made this for dinner with a chunky tomatoe sauce for dipping. I used pizza dough, one egg, 3 heaping tablespoons of butter and 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic. The pizza dough was crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. The dough sucked up all the juices and flavours, it was amazing!!! It stuck to my bundt pan but I think I didnt grease it enough...will make again!!!!

Very easy and worthwhile. I didn't have a bundt pan, but it still looked nice in a regular round pan.

This was great!  But I would like to try it with homemade bread dough, since I could tell a difference between the frozen and homemade.  But when you haven't the time, it is great as written.

I made this (first time) for Thanksgiving. I used the Alternative of buttermilk biscuits to save time. At first everyone thought they were going to have too much garlic... but once out of the oven we couldn't stop eating them!

This bread was really a treat for my family. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it came out perfect. I greased my nonstick bundt pan and the bread came out with very little coaxing. I will definately make this again. But my family really didn't know how to approch cutting it so we just ripped off chunks. It was very amusing and fun for the family!

This is terrific!  I used freshly grated Parmesan cheese and cut the bread into slices rather than pulling it apart.  It freezes well.  The second time I made it, I tried whole wheat bread and frankly, it wasn't as good.  I have two frozen loaves remaining, one white and one whole wheat, so today, I will use them to make another "loaf".

To say this bread is Yummy is an understatement. I made this for my Senior Complex's Thanksgiving dinner.  I had to taste it first of course and had to force myself to stop. I think I will also remake it using Tube Biscuits to save myself some time...I will definitely be making this again...A WINNER !

I made 2 loaves for my sons first birthday party and they were gone in no time.  Everybody raved about this recipe and I have forwarded it to some of my friends and family! I definitely recommend this to others.  I did increase the garlic powder a little and add 1 clove minced garlic since so many other reviweres claimed it wasnt garlicy enough- mine was just right!

This was YUMMY!   I put a pie plate under my tube pan to catch any butter that dripped out.  That was a good idea.

This recipe was awesome! My guests devoured it. Thank you for this delicious recipe. But I agree that the tube pan was not ideal. I will buy a silicone bunt pan for next time. Giny in Gatineau, qc

This smelled so good and it tasted good too. I had no problem baking this in the specified time. I gave it four stars because unfortunately my family was not thrilled with it. Was very pretty on the table too.

I had many of the troubles others had with this recipe, it didn't have much garlic flavor and took about 45 to 60 minutes to cook.  It  tasted good, but did not live up to what I was expecting.

I probably could have let the bread rise a little bit more than I did, but it ended up being a little bit dry for my tastes. The garlic and parmesan flavor was good, but like I said, just a little bit dry.

I just tried pulling this out of the oven after 1 hour!!!  Thw edeges are burnt and the middle isn't even warm.  Sorry to say that we aren't eating this.  I just sent my hubby to the store for some garlic bread.  I gave it the one star because the house does smell yummy!
