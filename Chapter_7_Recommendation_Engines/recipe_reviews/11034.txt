I thought the cookies had a wonderful taste.  I took them to work and everyone loved them.  I made about 4 dozen instead of 5 dozen with the normal sized batch.  Additionally, I used regular graham crackers and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to them.

I enjoyed this cookie.  Coating the dough balls with crumbs gave a lovely coating to the finished cookie.  I think I would like to try this with milk chocolate chips, mini if I can find them, and use less than two cups.  I felt the semi-sweet chips covered up the flavor of the graham.  Maybe a teaspoon of cinnamon with the dry ingredients would further enhance the spiciness.
My experience: I used a medium scoop (about 2 Tbs?) to form the balls, cooked for 12 minutes, left on the sheet for 2 more before moving to the cooling rack. They came out beautifully.  Yield 36 cookies.

So good, especially right out of the oven. Make sure not to cover them until they are completely cooled. They become soggy if you don't.

These are really delicious. I used graham cracker crumbs with 6 tsp cinnamon. I baked them for only 7 minutes. I found them a teensy bit dry, but I would make them again, maybe adding a little more butter or egg. I also drizzled with cinnamon ginger icing glaze. yum.

I really wanted to give this a 3 star, but I didn't think it was fair since I didn't add a few things.  I just made a "plain" cookie, did not add the chocolate chips or the nuts.  I thought they were just ok, but everyone else just raved about them.

I liked the crunchiness and flavor.  I made the mistake of following advise on cutting to half the choc chips... DON'T!

Awesome recipe- just what I was looking for... I used another kind of sweet, non- cinnamon crackers and added 1 Tbsp of cinnamon. I also used almonds (whole) instead of pecans, and used half the quantity of chocolate chips- a bit less sugar, maybe... still GREAT!

We thought these were really good, but would have liked a little more cinnamon flavor. Next time, I think I'll add some cinnamon to kick up that flavor in the mix.

Very good!  I wanted to try the recipe so bad but didn't have grahams so out of desperation I subbed vanilla wafers and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough.  Wonderful, nice and chewy in the center and crispy on the outside.

Husband really liked these. I thought they were good but nothing special. Good way to use up graham crackers.

These cookies were one of the gangs favorites. They tasted like a mix between a chocolate chip cookie and a gingersnap. 

I didn't follow the recipe as listed. Here were the changes I made: 
Instead of adding 2 cups of chocolate chips to the dough, I only added one (which seemed to be enough).
Instead of adding the graham cracker crumbs to the dough at the very end, I grounded the cookies until they resembled the texture of flour, and then added that to the dry mixture.
 Lastly, I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon to the dry mixture. 


Though I didn't follow the recipe exactly as it reads, the cookies seemed to be a crowd pleaser. I got a "Please make more!" and a couple of "oh my god..wow." which is enough for me to make them over and over again

I added a tablespoon or so of cinnamon to my recipe and put a pecan ontop of each cookie and they turned out really nice looking, and tasted great :)

These were really good.  I used mini M&Ms, however I don't think I used enough.  I picked out only the red and green ones for christmas.

I followed the recipes exactly. People loved them, but to me the cinnamon taste was too subtle to non-existant. Will add more cinnamon next time.

Just for personal preference, I used milk chocolate chips and left out the nuts but otherwise went by the recipe. A twist on traditional oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and a great way to use up that last sleeve of graham crackers. Pretty presentation too :)

I made this recipe only using half the graham quantity. There's already too much going on in there.

I made these with normal graham crackers on accident and minus the rolled oats on purpose, but they were still really good, and they kept for a long time!
