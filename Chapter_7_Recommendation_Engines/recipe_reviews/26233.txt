These are good. Really grease the cookie sheet!  These stick to parchment paper!

These cookies are amazing!  These turned out just like my German grandmother's cookies did years ago.  My only suggestion would be to add a bit more anise old (personal preference) and be sure not to overbake.  Absolutely delicious!

Great simple recipe for these cookies! I've made them before for my husband (very German family) and he loves them. The trick is to not over measure the flour and add a little fresh lemon zest.
