"craisins" work well here too. Just a little tip for newbies out there... store bought apples usually have a wax coating on them to make them shiny. To prevent your caramel from slipping off make sure you scrub that wax off or better yet... go apple picking with your family at an apple orchard and pick your own apples (so much fun and a great holiday tradition!) These caramel apples are good though and my husband prefers them to those covered with chocolate chips, drizzles or anything else that adds anymore sweetness to the apple. UPDATE:: another great topping is macadamia nuts and white chocolate with a milk chocolate drizzle... yum!
