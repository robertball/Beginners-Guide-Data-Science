This is a GREAT recipe!  The one thing that I followed from other reviews is to make sure this is drained very well.  I ended up mashing the squash in a strainer to get out the excess water in the squash.  I also upped the cooking time to about 27 minutes to dry it out a little more.  This tastes just like the squash casserole at a local restaurant!

I love the simple taste of yellow squash fresh from the garden, and this recipe lets that taste shine through. I pretty much halved this recipe(altho I used only 1 Tbs. of sugar and a light sprinkling of bread crumbs) and my husband and I ate it all. I heeded prior posts warning of excess moisture by mashing the squash in the collander, and it turned out with a nice texture - moist but not wet.It's a keeper - thanks for the post.

Great recipe - I steamed my squash and drained it very well. I used 1/4 c. butter instead of margarine. Will make a squash lover out of anyone.

I have made a casserole almost like this for years. My recipe is from a popular restaurant chain. It uses half the amount of butter and fresh bread crumbs and the crumbs go inside. Putting the bread crumbs inside helps to absorb the extra moisture and retains the vitamins that could be lost by mashing the liquid out.

When I read this recipe I thought it sounded too bland, but the other reviewers gave it such rave, I didn't change anything except to add a whole chopped vidalia onion. SCRUMCIOUS! Will make it often.

Couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day!  Really great recipe.  I used sliced carrots instead of green pepper; I sauteed a whole videlia onion in lieu of small amount the uncooked chopped onioin the recipe called for; I melted the butter first (and drizzled some on top of the breadcrumbs before baking); and I added corriander and garlic to taste.  Mine was not soupy at all like some of the reviews say.  This was great!  Will definitely make again.

We loved this casserole.  We have made it several times this summer.  The kids didn't eat it but it left more for us.  My husband mixed yellow squash and zucchini.

I always thought I hated squash.  It turns out that I just never knew how to cook it.  This is a delicious recipe.  I forgot to add the sugar, but it tasted great to me anyway.  I think I will add just a tablespoon of sugar next time to see if it tastes even better.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed walnuts and a sprinkling of parmesan.  This recipe is good either as an entree or as a side dish.

Everyone who eats this casserole loves it.  My husband says it's the best "squash stuff" he's ever eaten.  I'll take that as a compliment!  Very yummy!

Just what I was looking for.  I left out the sugar, used a small, diced onion and sauteed it before adding it to the squash, which I had carefully drained well, thanks to the other reviewers' suggestions.  Simple, comforting, good food.  Next time I may use panko crumbs and cut the butter a little.

Steaming the squash helps with the moisture issue and retains the vitamin content in the squash.  Mash them or not, the choice is yours. I sauteed the onion for added flavor; removed them to a bowl, added more butter to pan and browned the bread/cracker crumbs. This is an easy recipe to play with, should you choose.  The base recipe is very yummy!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  My father said it "has a taste of it's own".  Easy to make and very easy on the tastebuds.

I've been looking for a recipe like my grandmother's for years! This is it! I mashed the squash in a collander as recommended and instead of breadcrumbs, I took corn flakes and ground them to breadcrumb consistancy...add about 1/4 cup in with the mixture and put remainder on top. This is an awesome, easy recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good!  I was looking for something simple that would use the huge amount of summer squash I just bought at the local farmer's market.  This turned out great!  I did add a whole small vidalia onion though because I tend to like onion so I was pretty sure it would be good.  Delicious!  Thanks!

It was great to find a tasty squash recipe that was milk-free. I don't think my changes are too much, so I'm submitting my review. I used a small onion and added some paprika & garlic. Like another reviewer, I sauteed my squash & onions.  It didn't need the extra draining like other reviewers.  I used cornbread as a topping, to make it gluten-free.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for son's special dietary needs and omitted the onion; used corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and the whole family loved it! Hubby went back for seconds! Will definitely make again. Thanks, Gaye!

A great recipe for all the huge squash and zucchini from gardening friend. I removed seeds, steamed squash & zucchini & drained well. I put fresh bread crumbs in with casserole and added panko to the top. Thank you Gaye who submitted. This is great!

This recipe was excellent!  A friend of mine had given me extra yellow squash that she had and I wanted to try something different.  This recipe nailed it.  I only used a quarter cup of butter instead of half and it was still very tasty; even my husband enjoyed it :-)  Definitely a keeper.

Wow! This was delicious. It reminded me of a squash casserole from a restaurant called The Cooker. I made a few changes. I steamed the squash and had zero problem with it being too "liquidy". I also mixed the breadcrumbs into the casserole and very lightly dusted the top with breadcrumbs. I also used a tad more sugar (about 1/3 cup), only one egg, no salt or pepper and butter instead of margarine. I have no idea how much squash I actually used. I had a 5 pound squash from the market and only used the neck. I tasted as I added the ingredients. I didn't want to add too much sugar because I did not want it to be overly sweet. I wanted to actually be able to taste the squash. It was amazing and a huge hit with family who came for dinner and had never had this side dish before. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I was looking for a squash casserole that didn't use canned soup or cheese -- I did make some adjustments - I did not cook the squash covered in water - just a few tblsp in the pan - then drained cooked squash and did not mash - omitted sugar and followed another reviewers suggestion and mixed 2/3 of the bread crumbs right in with the squash and put the rest on top.  I used seasoned bread crumbs because that was what I had on hand and also mixed in one tablespoon chicken soup base (NOT boullion). Very good!

Great!  My changes: I used half zucchini and half yellow squash, cut the butter in half and used panko bread crumbs (all I had on hand!) The recipe came out terrific. I served it on a weeknight along side braised short-ribs and roasted cherry tomatoes. Great meal! I have saved this recipe and will be making this again.

I read the advice on the other comments and it came out great! I didn't have onion with me, so I just added onion powder. I will definitively do this one again.

I have been making a casserole like for years. I steam and mash the squash. I saute cristini mushrooms, onion, garlic, jalapeno peppers and add a small can of diced chilis. I then add the squash with an egg, add cheddar cheese and mix in the vegetables. I use a nonstick spray on my 8x8 pan, top with more cheese and back until brown. It is really good!

Exactly what I was looking for! I made this casserole for thanksgiving and my husband and I loved it. I did follow some recommendations from reviewers and mashed the squash in the strainer to drain it better. I also added a layer of parmesan cheese before the bread crumbs. It did not come out too moist at all. In fact, it was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was wonderful. You really taste the squash. I followed the recommendations of the others by draining the squash- pushing down on it while in the colander. I will definately make this again.

My husband had never had squash casserole before and he crinkled his nose like a 5 year old when I mentioned I was making it. He was sold after the first bite! He even bragged to his mom! Great recipe. I will definatley make it again.

This was a very nice recipe.  It was simple & fast to prepare.  It made not only a beautiful looking casserole, but very tasty as well.  One thing I did, to add a little more flavor was after putting the mixture in the pan to bake it, I put a coating of grated parmesan cheese, and then a coating of breadcrumbs.  I will be making this one again for certain!

I read the reviews before making this, and took some advice from some of the reviewers--such as sauteing the onion before adding it to the squash, and using butter in place of margarine. I also roasted my squash in the oven instead of boiling it, so as to avoid the extra liquid issue that some people seemed to have. I also used another reviewers idea of adding walnuts and parmesan as the topping instead of bread crumbs---and what a great idea! I added a pinch of sage and nutmeg in addition to the salt and pepper; and replaced the sugar with 1 tbsp maple syrup. This was so good, and very filling! I like that you can use the basic recipe as a jumping off point to add whatever flavors you would like. I think it would be good with more maple flavor and either some bacon or sausage added to it as a brunch idea. I could also see it being delicious with some sharp cheddar cheese and jalapenos in it too. The possibilities are endless! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this with squash and zuchinni straight out of our garden.  I must say this was delicious !  I did saute my veggies.  I also used garlic butter crackers and crumbled them up and put half of them in the mix and the other half on top and it was ohhh so yummy !  Thanks for a recipe that allows the veggies to shine through.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but this was so watery and bland.  I used Progresso bread crumbs and I think I used too many because it was overwhelming.  Too bad. I was hoping for a healthy, and delicious, squash recipe.

Great recipe for all the summer squash.  The 1/2 recipe was the perfect size for 2 adults and 2 kids.  I mashed the squash in a colander and the consistency was great but the bread crumbs on top stayed too dry.  I used the canned bread crumbs - maybe try panko instead next time or mix most of it in with the squash.  It's also a bit too sweet for us so I will cut the sugar next time too.  But we've already talked about making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good basic squash casserole recipe. I didn't boil my squash- I sliced them up with a whole small vidalia onion and put in a frying pan sprayed with pam covered them then cooked them on low until nice and tender. Then I mixed everything together. I did substitute bread crumbs with saltine crackers and mixed them with the mixture- I used a whole pack. I had no problems with moisture.

This squash casserole was great! The only ingredient I altered was the sugar - substituted Splenda and only used a teaspoon or so. Oh, I did use butter instead of margarine (hate the stuff). I guess that's two ingredients then! The squash's taste really shines through! Thanks Gaye!

I was given a huge zucchini and wondered what to do with it....this was the perfect answer! my kids liked it ( a plus), we found it to be a light, wonderful side to our pork chops. I would reccommend! Yummy!!! I halved the recipe because I wasn't sure how it would go over, next time will make the full recipe as it was just a good the next day! Thanks for the great recipe :)

Awesome recipe! I halved the recipe and it turned out great. I, too, steamed the squash rather than boiling it. I mashed the squash in a bowl, drained, mashed some more, and drained again. I didn't have any problems with moisture because of this. I also just used two pinches of sugar as we don't care for sweet dishes (unless it's dessert). Thanks for this!

5+ stars so yummy. I also drained the squash in a strainer and then smashed it part way there and the rest of the way in our mini chopper. I also reserved 2 tbsp butter and drizzled it on top of the plain bread crumbs.

Yum!!  I used a little less margarine (maybe 5 Tbs.), boiled the squash and onions together, drained them well, then added a little bit of milk to my eggs.  This reminded us of corn pudding.  Sweet and delicious!!

Awesome.  The first time I made it, it was kind of watery, despite draining it.  The second time I made it, I drained the squash well, mashed it, then wrang it out in a paper towel (the frozen spinach draining treatment ;)).  Made it much less watery.

I added cinnamon in place of some of the sugar (2 tbs of sugar and enough cinnamon to lightly cover the top of the squash mixture. I made this twice. The first time was in a round 2 quart dish. It was a bit watery. the second was in a rectangular shallow dish. I was firmer and tastier.

I really liked this casserole, since it was more squash and less casserole stuff. I used half squash, and half zucchini, and threw in some carrots just because I had them in my frig. Very good, will definitely make again.

Really great flavor. Nice to have a squash casserole that doesn’t involve a cream soup or cheese. I took the advice of previous reviewers and mashed the squash in a colander to be sure and get out all of the water. Will definitely make again

I made this for Christmas dinner. I made a few changes but not much. I followed one reviewers advice by putting bread crumbs inside as well as on top. I didn't mash the squash either. It turned out great. I will definitely make it again. I want to make it with vidalia onions next time.

I adjusted the recipe for four servings; pleasantly surprised with the outcome!  The only thing I changed was using real butter in place of margarine. Be sure to drain the squash well; I had a colander that was suitable for this and it turned out just fine. From now on, this is going to be my go-to recipe for squash.

I loved it.  My husband even liked it an he usually won't eat squash that's not deep fried.  It would have been better if I hadn't forgot the onion.  I use onion in the dish I usually make for myself on top of the stove.  This one is so much better.

Absolutely delicious!  I mashed the squash with my hand-held potato masher and added some breadcrumbs to the mixture to keep it firm.  A little shredded cheddar on top completes this wonderful recipe.

Scaled down to 5-6 servings and added more onions and sugar. Also used canola butter, italian bread crumbs and a touch of bacon grease. Cooked for 28 minutes. Excellent and easy reciepe.

Made for first time for a party and it was the first dish gone. Many of the guests asked for the recipe. Made no changes, hubby asked for it again.

Easy, simple and delicious! I will note that I followed the directions loosely but used all the same ingredients. It's summer squash season in Texas and it was nice to find something different that even the kids will eat.

Made a big batch for church supper.  Used real butter instead of margarine. ½ the sugar.  Boiled for 30 minuets then mashed, no issue with being too runny.  Was to die for yummy.

I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  I used a whole small onion because we love onions, although next time I will saute them first.  That's the only change.  I'll be making this often!

This is a great recipe for squash casserole if you are not looking for one with cheese!  We enjoyed it but I think next time I will not include the onions..

when cooking the squash, we added a little sour salt for a bit of bite; and then we thought we had bread crumb but they were full of weavels! so we subbed matzo meal, which always seems to be on hand, added a little bit of brown sugar, and some chopped pecans. the result was wonderful. but i would definitely use bread crumbs! :)

Rhis was great!! I used zuchinni and squash with red onions sauted it instead of boil it, i used both since my kids will change thier mind on what color of squash they like day by day. i do not care for boiled which is why i used sauted, ialso did not add the eggs, my youngest can't eat them or any milk or soy products, so trying to find a cassarole dish everyone will like is hard. my hubby even like it even tho there is not much in veggies he doesn't like. the only thing i would change in my recipe is stir fry the squash a little more, then i transfered it into a stoneware bowl topped with fresh garden tomatos and baked for 30 minutes. THANK this was awesome
