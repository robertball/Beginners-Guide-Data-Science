What a wonderful recipe!!  I omitted the squash and used only sweet potatoes but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious!  Way better than the usual candied sweet potatoes.  Will most definitely make again.

Excellent recipe.  Not too sweet like many sweet potato casseroles.  The only changes I made were to use more sweet potatoes and squash (maybe a half pound more of each) and less butter and brown sugar mix on top.  This tastes great warm or cold.

Very yummy and easy to make.  I accidentally bought white yams instead of sweet potatoes and it came out just fine.  It wasn't too sweet, and was a huge hit with the entire family!

I made this for Thanksgiving as a change from the usual sweet potato casserole, and everyone loved it, even those who weren't big fans of sweet potatoes.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  The apples add a nice touch of texture.  Would definitely make again for the holidays!

I've prepared this for 30 for three Thanksgiving dinners in France, and every time it's been a great success. I've halved the sugar and butter and didn't miss either. Every time I get recipe requests and the dishes are scraped clean.

Fantastic!  Made it for Thanksgiving last week with no alterations (except for using Gala apples) and everyone loved it, even those (including me) who don't normally like sweet potatoes.  Not too sweet, but sweet enough.

Made this casserole for Thanksgiving dinner for 19 people. It was a terrific hit. I followed the recipe exactly, except fot the golden delicious apples, I used red delicious, because I had some here and turned out a real "keeper". Of course several wanted the receipe, so I told them to go to this sight. Thank you so much. Joyce

Did a test run last week and my hubby and I both loved it! Making it again today to take to our Thanksgiving dinner. Great recipe. Easy to make, and delicious!
