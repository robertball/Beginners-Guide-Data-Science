These are really good.  You don't even miss the fact that there is no tortilla/shell.  The only downside was that you should only make what you plan to eat.  If you try to save leftovers you will be disappointed in the results the next day. These are meant to be eaten fresh.

Instead of tilapia I used sole but other than that remained true to the recipe.  Very tasty.  I will be making it again.

I loved this recipe. I am making this for the third time in as many weeks.
