I made this for my Bunco group. Most liked it. I could only find ginersnaps. Probably won't make it again.

I used to make this 15 years ago when i lived in Hampshire....Ginger snaps are an absolute fine substitute, to make it more special i dunked my cookies in sweet sherry before layering with the cream and mandarin oranges.
