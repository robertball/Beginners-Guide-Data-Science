This is my first time making Tabouli. The only Tabouli I have ever had is from my local grocery store and love its refreshing taste, but it cost four bucks for an 8 oz. container. I read the reviews and added an extra tomato and more onion and herbs. When the bulgur was ready to add it was a huge amount (swelled to twice as much)...much more bulger than vegtables which differs fromthe kind I like from my grocery store. So I just added about half of it to my veggie mixture. I don't know what traditional Tabouli is supposed to be like, but prefer more veggies than the bulgur. I let this sit in the refrigerator overnight and it taste much better today...I do suggest making it a day ahead for the flavors to blend. It is a nice refreshing salad on a hot sunny afternoon. I will make again but only with half as much bulger wheat and twice as much vegetable/herb mixture.

This is a  good base recipe. Per the reviews many felt the results were a bit flat or lacked zip so I tweaked it a bit.  
First: when cooking the wheat, I salted the water the way you would if cooking pasta. I then didn't need to add salt to the salad.
Second: I doubled the cumin.
Third: I substituted lime for lemon 
Forth: I made it 24 hour ahead so the flavors had plenty of time to marinate. 
The result was a knock out.

I thought this was tasty, but wasn't exactly what I had in mind.  The ratio of bulgur to the other ingredients was too much.  It seemed like more of a bulgur salad, as opposed to tabouli, where I expect the herbs to shine through more.  The lemon overpowered the cilantro so much that cilantro wasn't the main flavor, which is what I was hoping for.  That being said, it was good, and healthy.  I would make it again and just have different expectations!

I heart Cilantro and this was fantastic.  I replaced 1/4 cup of Bulgar Wheat with Barley just to give it more OOMPH and used Cannellini beans.

I wasn't sure if I liked this recipe at first because it seemed the bulgur wheat overpowered the other ingredients. However, I changed my mind after it set in the fridge overnight. The cilantro flavor was stronger and overall more flavorful. I think next time though I will add more garlic (4 cloves) and cilantro (bring it up to 1 cup).

Absolutely delicious! My class used this recipe in a menu prepared for 100 people and everyone loved it. My only complaint is that the recipe does not tell you which size of bulgur grain to use. We used medium grind bulgur and it cooked perfectly at the recommended soaking time.

I just got a little taste of this and it's delicious!  I'm sure it will be wonderful with our chicken kebabs for tonights dinner.  This was my first time making tabouli.  I acually used wheat berries which are harder and take longer to cook; next time I will buy the bulgur wheat.  I skipped the cumin added some cucumber anda little mint because I have it growing wild in my yard; I also used some grape tomatoes that I sliced, it looks beautiful with all the bright colors!  Thank you!

This is delicious! I made this as stated, with the exception of using 2 tbl fresh lime juice instead of lemon juice. I'm just not a fan of lemon juice.

Okay since I don't know what authentic Tabouli tastes like, I will give this a 4 out of 5.  Maybe my lemons were too big but wowser, it was very lemony.  I also used cracked wheat and flat leaf parsley because both bulgar & fresh cilantro are difficult to find in my stores.  Will make this again, but cut back on the lemon juice.  The recipe also should have stated that the wheat should be cooled before adding the rest of ingredients.  I had to put the complete salad in the freezer just to get it cool enough for dinner.  Definitely best made early in the day.

very tasty! I thought that it was a lemony but that of course could have just been the particular lemons I used. I thought the bulgar grains were a bit big/bulky and substituting the bulgar for couscous would also be very nice - definately reccommend trying this cilantro tabouli though!

I think this is a great basic recipe for taouli but by adding 1/2 c  chopped greek olives and 1/2 c of diced cucumbers it adds some more flavor without the added seasoning!

Way too lemony..i think the juice of two lemons is too much. My usually not picky daughter would not eat it. I suggest 2TBS of lemon juice instead.

What a great idea to use cilantro for this salad, as we are big fans in my family. Today, I was looking for a way to use up my parsley and this was a delicious blend of flavors. Thanks for the 5 star recipe! I look forward to trying it with cilantro next time for a change of pace.

I found this recipe after requesting the recipe from a family member after trying the recipe. I normally do not like Tabouli that much but loved this recipe and I think the reason was the substitution of cilantro for parsley. Overall this recipe tastes great and gets better when left in the fridge.

Absolutly yummy! I do not care for Mint so the Cilantro is a perfect alternative.  I make this a lot - it is especially good for pot luck and large family gatherings!

I have to say that going into this I was not a Tabouli fan and I'd never prepared bulgur before.  I followed the recipe to the letter, including using fresh lemons which I almost never buy.  I made this the night before I tried it.  First bite I was still not convinced and had visions of throwing it out.  But I perservered and I found myself enjoying the fresh flavor.  I think it would benefit from more cilantro.  I will finish what I have but I'm not sure I will make it again.  Hubs said after three bites he would pass.

Very good.  You can adjust the ingredients easily to your liking.  I used 1 lemon, 2 bunches of cilantro, extra olive oil, and extra garlic.  I also used white onion instead of green because that was what I had.  It came out very, very good.

tabouli is one of my all time favorites and what a great idea to add the cilantro! I didn't have any bulgar so I used couscous and I didn't want to make too much so I just made 1/2 cup of couscous but kept the veggies the same...only used 1/2 lemon and 1 TBS olive oil (right from Italy, thx Mom) Wonderful with the hummus III recipe and some warm pita!

This was wonderful! I added some chopped, seedless cucumber and used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic plus a bit of fresh parsley and some lenom pepper. Great Idea using cilantro.

I always wanted to try tabouli but I hate mint (not even in toothpaste). This gave me a great way to have it. I'm even thinking parsley could work too.

It was pretty good and a great, refreshing dish for the summer. My friends thought it needed a little something added to it, but we couldn't put our finger on what. They still ate a ton of it, though!

I used quinoa instead of bulger. 2 lemons is too much. Use 1 and add more if you think it's needed. Overall, very good recipe.

I love classic tabouli with parsley and mint. When I saw this, I knew I had to try it. I love everything in it. I took this to work today and my friends and I really enjoyed it. The flavors blend together beautifully. Thank you so much for this version.

Second time making this, and I'm a fan! I dislike mint, parsley doesn't add much flavor, and I'm a cilantro junkie. 

I like to add garbanzos (for protein), and finely diced cukes (for crunch).... and sprinkle some feta on top when serving. Traditional tabouli has a lower ratio of bulgur, but I prefer it like this.

3 cups of boiling water to 2 cups of Bulgur Wheat....Let it set for at least 1 hour to absorb the water, drain the excess water then put in the freezer for an hour or more to get it chilled.  1/4C extra virgin oil...1/4C of real lemon(shake well before pouring) small can of (drained)diced tomatoes w/green chiles(10) oz...and 12 oz can of reg (drained)diced tomatoes.  1 1/2 C fresh chopped parsley..6-8 tender scallions--chopped with the green stems..2 rounded Tbl of minced garlic....1 scant Tbl of lemon pepper seasoning...tsp of salt in the boiling water..If you have the cherry tomatoes use them for the fresh effect...dice them..You can add sliced black olives...cold garbanzo beans or anything else you'd like in a salad..I've even chopped up celery (2 stems)...Everyone loves it---never have any left to bring home when i take it..:)  I really like the crunchiness of the bulgur wheat.

This recipe is simply delicious, followed others advise and only juiced one lemon and that is PLENTY!  It's a flavor explosion in your mouth and I love the texture!  I think I will add a cucumber next time too it would make a great addition.

I really liked this. I added regular ground pepper instead of fresh, more garlic, cut back the lemon a tad and used cooking onions instead of green because I didn't have them. WOW! I'll surely make it again and I won't buy green onions. It was great. I liked the strong flavor.

I love Tabouli.  My options to eat it in the Coastal Bend are few.  There are only two places I know of that I can purchase good tabouli in town and even those locations are hit or miss.  Making it on my own was the best alternative.  Great recipe!

I love this recipe! a local restaurant used to serve tabbouleh as one of their side options and they stopped doing it. Have to make my own now. I added chopped cucumber, celery, and olives. Also, feta cheese when serving.

YUM!  You have to love Cilantro and Lemon to love this recipe.    I tried Tabouli for the first time recently.  It was made with 'rice' cauliflower .  I used cauliflower instead of bulgur wheat.  Delicious.

We really enjoyed this excellent salad.  As with any savory recipe calling for lemon juice, I started with a small amount, allowing for the ability to adjust the taste as needed.  I used grape tomatoes and made sure to add plenty of them.

Since I'm not a cilantro lover I used parsly, seedless cucumbers diced very small, green onions and of course tomatoes.. I found using plum tomatoes as they have less seeds.. As for the wheat portion cook as listed but put in last! Test by tbsp until you get the flavor you're looking for.. As for the oil and lemon juice again add a bit at a time.. It's much easier to add more than to remove to much... Also I have diced garlic and I add this about a tsp.. Then rest of spices.. No cumin.. Warm up some pita bread and what a lovely snack all day long!

Deliciour, fiber-rich at 7 grams per 1/2 cup plus lemon which aids in digestion.  I skipped the cumin b/c I don't like everything to taste like a taco, and added some lime juice to deepen the flavor.

I really liked this- very refreshing and healthy! I made it fat free, so skipped the oil, reduced the lemon, and after the bulger was made- only put half in with the vegetables. Topped with fat free feta- super good!
