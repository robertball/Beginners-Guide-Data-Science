This was really great!  I was skeptical about adding beer to ice cream, but it was delicious.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and used semi-sweet chocolate (b/c that is what I had in the cupboard) and this was a HUGE success!

LOVED THIS!  I did use semi-sweet chips and I added Heath toffee chips too.  Took it to a St. Patty's party and everyone ate it up.

The flavor of this ice cream is amazing.  I doubled the recipe because I'm bringing it to a St. Patrick's Day party and wanted plenty to go around.  I used one bag bittersweet chocolate chips and one bag semi-sweet to try and balance the two.  It is fairly sweet (which I love) but if you don't have a real strong sweet tooth it probably wouldn't hurt to cut back on the sugar a little.  The ice cream by itself is very tasty but it also feels like a blank canvas to add any of your other favorite ice cream toppers like nuts or whipped cream (toffee bits sounds like a great idea!) and I really wish I could make waffle cones because for some reason I imagine this ice cream going perfectly in one.

SD posted this recipe on the Recipe Exchange & when CC84 brought it my attention, I knew I HAD to try it! I just enjoyed a serving and am torn between a 4 & 5 star rating.  It's GREAT, but the bittersweet chips make it a bit too bitter for us.  I'm not sure if it's just a personal taste issue or what.  When I make this again, I'll try it w/either semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips.  I used a home brewed Irish Stout which added some nice flavor.  The chips don't fully blend, leaving an awesome little bit of texture, kind of like in a good vanilla bean ice cream.  Don't be afraid of the beer-def give this a whirl!  TY for a great recipe, oldskooler!

I thought this was great, but hubby...not so much, which surprises me due to the fact that he LOVES Guinness AND ice cream. He said it was TOO rich, and I agree, but that's why I liked it so much. I also used semi-sweet chips (Thanks, LTH), and am glad that I did. I think I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The whole family likes this but we all agree that it's super rich---one scoop is all you want.  I don't understand why the little "grains" of chocolate......   We all wish it was smoother.

This was time consuming and expensive having tried 2 times and getting brown gravy.

It was simple to make, but the texture once you added the beer (I used Guinness) became grainy.  Still tasted good, but just didn't like the texture.

I've made it twice now, and the texture just doesn't seem to be working out for me. I will likely continue to tweak the recipe (ie the second time I added more cream and cut the beer in half) as time goes on because I liked the taste, but the texture just wasn't... smooth or creamy as I would like my ice cream to be.

Followed the original recipe and it was very good.  Added some heath bar crunch bits for a little extra bite.  Always a hit when I make this.

Tried this twice. Both times failed. What this recipe fails to tell you is to add the stout with about 2 minutes left in the freezing cycle of your ice cream maker. Otherwise, the mixture will not turn to custard.
