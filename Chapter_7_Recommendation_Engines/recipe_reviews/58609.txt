This was a very light, refreshing sorbet but it didn't taste a whole lot like coconut. I added a little bit of sugar just because I felt that it really needed some, and the lime flavor came out just right-not too sour or sweet.

I cannot rate this recipe as I made it incorrectly, and realized my mistake too late.  It is VERY important to use Cream of Coconut (which is sweetened) and not Coconut Milk (which is unsweetened).  I think this is why other reviewers claimed this dessert was too tart.  I added a cup of sugar after freezing, but before hardening and even this could not save the flavor.  Will try again with the right ingredients.

If you can't find cream of coconut in the baking section of your store, try a liquor store. It is sold here under the brand name of "Coco Casa" as a pi√±a colada mix. Anyway, this is one super sorbet! I made it just as written. The lime flavor is mild but welcomely refreshing. And yes, it is a sweet sorbet, but so long as you expect that, it is really good. Very nice! Thanks for sharing this one, Nandabear!

5 Stars. Perfect recipe, as-is, even if I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla & some grated lemon zest - not necessary. I read that it's best for all ingredients to be chilled well, so we chilled down the lime juice and coconut cream and we used ice water. We also added 2 teaspoons of light rum - I read that alcohol reduces iciness in the final product, so we tried it. We ran the Cuisinart for 30 minutes, resulting in a smooth, creamy soft serve and froze the rest in individual containers. * * * I have to tell you, we took the just-made sorbet, which was rich and creamy -not too sweet, not too tart- and dropped into into a tall, cold glass of Vanilla Coke with ice cubes, then stirred with a straw to make *the most incredible* float! It creamed and frothed up in the glass. Delicious and decadent. This is now our favorite dessert, hands down. An adult version of course is quite nice with more light rum in it. * * * I just tasted the sorbet that froze and ripened overnight and it has a wonderful, creamy texture, not icy. It also has the same sweet-tart taste as yesterday, so it did not sweeten appreciably, as I read that it might. As mentioned by another reviewer, it does melt quickly, especially if it's hot in your kitchen. * * * Did I mention this was our first recipe using our beautiful new red Cuisinart? Couldn't have picked a better recipe as our first. * * * Footnote: Just topped out pancakes with this. Sinful!

This sorbet is really delicious if you use syrup, but not water. I used coconut milk (I just didn`t go for a cream of coconut), lime juice, a little lime zest and 1/2 cup of syrup. My sorbet was so delicious and tropical. It reminds me of Brazilian Lemonade from this site. In any case, thank you for a great idea, Joyosita!

I loved the recipe. I followed it exactly and it wasn't to sour or to sweet. No sugar needed. I also tried it substituting the lime juice with pineapple juice and it was sooooo good. If you like pina coladas, try it with the pineapple juice!! I can't decide which way I like best. Thanks Joy for a great recipe and new ideas!!

I christened my new ice cream maker w/ this recipe! Like Frambuesa, I too thought it must need a bit of sugar so I added a few tbp. It was too sweet & next time I won't add any. I served this for dessert in vintage sherbet glasses & garnished w/ a sprinkling of lime zest....it was the perfect finish to a Caribbean Shrimp salad. We loved it & look forward to having it many times....thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly to make a lovely, bright, sweet-tart flavored sorbet.  The second time I added ~1/2 c unsweetened coconut milk that I had left over from another recipe, ~1 c. light cream, and ~1/2 c extra sugar, and the result was a wonderfully refreshing coconut-lime ice cream.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  Second time I made the following minor changes for a more intense flavor: washed the lime well, dried it and grated it for lime zest; added 1 1/2 teaspoons of coconut extract. I made sure all of my ingredients were very cold, made the sorbet, put in plastic container & froze over night.  It is a delightful & refreshing light dessert following a great Tex-Mex meal. Also, garnished with a perfect whole strawberry.

I found this exact recipe in an old issue of Gourmet magazine from November 1997.  It's pretty good as is, but I also added some coconut flakes for a little something extra.

Excellent recipe, easy and a huge hit.  Anyone who reviews it as too tart wasn't using the correct ingredients ,i.e. Coconut milk/cream rather than Cream of Coconut.  Lime zest over the top as a garnish was a great suggestion!

This recipe is great! I would recommend that coconut milk lovers stick with using coconut milk, It is more suddle and tastes more smooth than the cream of coconut. The cream of coconut was VERY sweet to me and had a weird texture frozen, Infact a friend who had tasted it said that it tasted like sweet frozen cheese cake. I am going to  use this recipe in the future, with coconut milk and maybe boil peppermint leaves in the water for a flavored water.

This was really good!  The recipe couldn't be simpler and is perfect just the way it is.  Tastes like something you might have for dessert at a thai restaurant.

Love this recipe! Had to make some modifications though since I can't get the cans of cream of coconut where I live in Cambodia. I just used a can of sweetened-condensed milk and then added my coconut cream powder to the water in the recipe. I also added a bit of coconut extract and some shredded coconut to give more depth to that flavor. One of our dinner guests said he was amazed that you could actually taste the coconut and lime flavors "side-by-side" instead of one dominating the other. It has been a big hit each time I've shared it with others.

Fantastic! I, also, added a little rum and a little lime zest and doubled the recipe.  Poured finished sorbet into ramekins and froze to have single servings for a party. So easy and so good.

You don't need an ice cream maker to make this. I put all ingredients (I also add some lime zest) in a flat baking dish and place in the freezer. Once it starts to freeze I take it out and scrape it with a fork. I'll do that two or three more times til it's frozen. Easy to make and very light and refreshing!

This was delicious and totally simple. I had trouble finding Cream of Coconut, but finally located some with the drink mixers. I made the recipe exactly as written, except I added a little bit of lime zest. The zest helped balance the sweetness, and the tiny green speckles are so pretty in the sorbet. I will certainly make this again!

The problem with this recipe is that it is WAY too sour.  I like sour things but I ended up having to open a can of sweetened condensed milk and add some to it.  We ended up with a nice milkshake after I did that so for this reason only I'll give it 3 stars.  Sorry.

Outstanding! For everyone who claims this "isn't sweet enough", double-check your ingredients. Coconut milk is what you buy in the intl food/Thai section of the store. This is NOT what you want. The correct ingredient, 'cream of coconut' is insanely sweet, and is located in the liquor section, with the cocktail mixers (lime juice, grenadine, sweet and sour mix, etc).

I'm giving this a 3 only because I'm assuming I did something wrong for mine to turn out the way they did. Everyone else seems to love it, so I'm posting this only as a warning that you might want to test the recipe first before serving to guests. I thought I liked tart things, but this was extreme. I don't think anyone ate more than a bite or two. I went over the recipe and can't think of anything I did wrong, but I must be missing something. We used it up by adding a spoonful to the homemade shakes we like to make.

This is NOT a sweet dessert -- if you're looking for ice cream, don't make this recipe.
BUT it is such an interesting taste.  Very exotic.
Just don't plan on eating more than a quarter cup -- max.

'I say doctor is there something I can do? You put the lime in the coconut and drink it all up!'   "If you like pina coladas" Lol, old songs!  Yummy!  My first sorbet in my new ice cream maker and absolutely fantastic.   Rich and creamy from the cream of coconut with a lime undertone.  I stood by the ice cream maker and sampled and was suprised there was any left in the maker to move to freezer when it was finished.  Sweet, creamy and a little bit tart.  I'm from Texas so I'd call it a margacolada or a pinarita.  This will be my summertime special dessert and  I will make many times over this summer!  Btw, I added a teaspoon of coconut extract and used coconut water instead of plain water. Yum!

This Lime-Coconut sorbet is our favorite dessert to serve when we host our friends who need to follow a plant-based diet for health reasons. The no dairy, wheat, or nuts restrictions cut down on what dessert we can offer them. When  I tried this recipe, it was truly a winner for everyone. The creaminess of the cream of coconut mimics dairy products, and the lime is the perfect marriage with the coconut. I used the suggestion of adding two tablespoons of rum per recipe to the mixture before serving, and then doubled everything because the rum allows me to serve it after being in the freezer for a long time. Our favorite addition is to top with Hershey's syrup. Superb together!

I was looking for ice-cream type recipes that did not call for heavy whipping cream when I found this! It is so good! It's creamy and summery... I feel like I'm on the beach when I'm eating it ;)

This is a 5 star recipe on it's own, I added toasted coconut layered throughout the sorbet and garnished on top...which would make it a 6 star success!

To everyone who thinks this recipe is either too sour, not sweet enough, or not coconut-y enough, make sure you are using Cream of Coconut (such as Coco Lopez) and not coconut milk.
