The batter tones down the peaches perfectly if you're not a big peach person, but you can still taste them. Very good. Easy to make. P.S. if you don't want to have like a thousand of them, cut the recipe in half.....

We gave this recipe four stars because the Fritters were delicious but it wasn't the easiest thing to make.

We gave it a 4-star rating because the flavor of the spices didn't shine as much as we wanted it to, but the peaches made up for the lack of flavor. It was a tad bit hard but it was really good.
