I followed the quantities exactly.  You absolutely have to like salt on your watermelon to like this.  My husband loved it.  I couldn't eat it.

Easiest recipe but so tasty!!  I probably used more basil then needed.....I looooooove basil...do not be afraid of the chili. Gives it just a hint of spicy which is countered by the sweet basil and watermelon.  Salt... I just ground pink Himalayan over it I didnâ€™t measure. Awesome summer treat!  Thanks for recipe!

7.21.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/254422/watermelon-basil-salad/ ... Ya know how you like some foods separately, but not together?   I was hesitant to try this recipe because of that.  Watermelon had to go.  Fresh basil outside.  O-kay, I'll try.  What a surprise!  The spiciness was subtle; basil wasn't overpowering.  A really good blend of flavors without taking away from the watermelon.  Thanks!

7.7.16  Had a chilled mini melon in the fridge, so decided to give this a go for lunch today.  The combination of basil with that little bit of lemon, chili powder and kosher salt is almost magical.  And at 10 calories, go ahead and eat your heart out.  WOW, loved it!
