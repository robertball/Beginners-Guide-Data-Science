I have been looking for this simple marinade to put on my chex mix recipe.  My mother-in-law has made it for years and my husband likes this particular combination the best.  My suggestion is to tripple the marinade and then half way through slather the last third over the mix.  It may sound like overkill but after only doubling the marinade it wasn't flavorfull enough.

Welp, I am very fortunate not to have any 'pickers' so I just used a bag of Traditional Chex Mix using whole cashews and whole pecans.  This recipe is excellent!  Every one just grabbed handfuls and ate all they grabbed!

although i think this recipe serves as a good starting point, i found it too salty and not flavourful enough. i'm now making another batch using more garlic powder, less salt, hot sauce, mustard powder and some curry powder.

We loved this so much that I made it three times in the course of just under two weeks! SO GOOD. Thanks!

I have not even put this in the oven yet, and I can already tell that it is going to taste better than a different snack-mix recipe I made earlier.

This was very good - I increased the sauce just because I like it that way, others may not need to.  Thanks!

Good idea ~ only put things in that the folks want to munch! Loved it and I only added a few extra herbs; cumin, dill, and a little thyme.

Great snack mix!  I doubled the "dressing" for the mix and added a bit more of the cereals.  Overall an addictive mix of goodies!

Very good.  Instead of putting it in the oven, I put it in a great big microwaveable bowl and cooked for 5-6 minutes total, stirring every 2 minutes.  Spread on paper towels and let cool.  Store in air tight containers.
