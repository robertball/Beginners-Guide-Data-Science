This is the perffect hollandaise.  You will notice that the only people that have complained about it are the people that used the actual amount of salt or pepper.  It's either 5 stars or 1 star.  People, all cooks know that you salt and pepper to taste, always take that measure with, well, a grain of salt.

Salt and pepper to taste, people, salt and pepper to taste.  Have any of you cooked anything before?  What makes this a good recipe is the process, a lot faster than the traditional methods with the same result.  Also, the proportions are right for the other ingredients except the lemon, I would use slightly less lemon, however if it’s a small lemon, half is right, but the egg to butter is the right amount.  The cold water trick is also very useful for saving a broken sauce.

Thanks for the template :>For those of you having trouble with this recipe, start with *unsalted* butter in the pan. Then, beat the yolks in a separate bowl, and start adding lemon juice sparingly, until you like how the yolks & lemon juice taste together. A tip: the uncooked combo of the eggs & lemon will be just *slightly* more acidic than the combo will taste when it's cooked. So add lemon juice until you like the raw taste, then add just a tiny bit more juice, because the eggs will then cook up and add a creamy flavor, which will just slightly tone down the lemon (adding just a touch more juice than you think you need will keep your finished sauce from tasting too bland).THEN add only as much salt & pepper as you like. The amounts listed for this recipe are far too overwhelming. I didn't add any salt. It only took about three minutes for my sauce to thicken and become creamy, but you must add the yolk mixture only drops at a time, and you really have to whisk the sauce fast.I was very pleased with my sauce & will certainly be using this "template" again, probably as my staple recipe for hollandaise. But make sure you make the changes to suit your own flavor.Thanks!

I never in my entire life gave anybody  0ne Star only. It is the first time. The proportion at the beginning looked very odd:  1 teaspoon of salt and juice of ½ lemon for 3 egg yolks and ½ cup of butter!  So, I put just the half of salt.  The souse came salty like a sea salt and sour like a lemon itself.   It is bad, really bad recipe.

Perfect Sauce!

And YES, season to taste is always essential to being a great cook.  For those of you new to cooking, please disregard the insulting comments from Locklandworth and BoJacks.  Sometimes it takes following a recipe or making mistakes to create the great cook you will eventually become. 

I honestly think the person that posted the recipe meant a pinch of salt and pepper not a teaspoon of salt and pepper.  lol 

Just a little hint with this recipe:  if using salted butter you may want to eliminate salt altogether.  But taste your product to ensure it's tasty for you and your family before adjusting.

Happy Cooking!!!

I used lemon juice from a bottle instead of from a lemon and it was still great, but be careful not to put to much lemon in from the bottle.

I made this exactly as instructed (except of course for the amt of salt and pepper) and it broke apart immediately in the saucepan.  I added a shock of cold water and whisked it but it only helped temporarily--when I put it on the plate it turned into dry, gritty foam within seconds and was inedible.  The lemon juice, perhaps.

Made this tonight to top fresh steamed asparagus.  Family loved it.  I liked that you can make it in a saucepan rather than the trouble of a double boiler or the less-than-cooked blender version.  It took me only 10 min and was creamy and smooth with just the right thickness.  I'm sure my sub will put some cooks off - but - in this house I cook with smart balance spread for health reasons - no butter here.  So I used 1/2 C smart balance melted in a small sauce pan.  In a bowl I whisked 3 egg yolks, 1 1/2 TBSP lemon juice (bottled), 1 tsp cold water and a shake of salt and pepper to our tastes.  Whisked it in to the melted smart balance and continued whisking on low heat for about 5 min.  It was perfect!

So many other recipes available, why use this one? A "classic" Hollandaise sauce is will not break if you follow two simple rules:
1. use a double boiler! The water just below a simmer, and not touching the top half of the double boiler.
2. add melted butter in a slow steady stream while whisking (use a french whip)the egg yolks, then slowly add boiling hot water, continue whisking until thickened. Lemon juice, salt & pepper (to taste!) are whisked-in after removing the top pot from  the double boiler. I've never had a Hollandaise break on me yet... but find another recipe first. This isn't it.

I have cooked all my life and never made hollandaise sauce. This was very easy for my first time. I did have a problem getting all the butter to mix in after the 8 min. so I added one more yolk and it was perfect.I did cut down on the lemon juice because I dont like it too tart. Thanks for sharing

This recipe was terrible. It calls for a TEASPOON of salt and a TEASPOON of pepper. You end up making a gritty, salty, peppery mess! I would just add a pinch of each and there you have it. Thoroughly disappointed.

I like this recipe for the simplicity.  Hollandaise Sauce recipes are usually more complicated.  This is simple and works.  However, I would agree about the salt. . . at most I think 1/4 tsp is all you need.  If you were to give this recipe to a beginner cook, they would be confused about how salty it turns out.  I think you also have to take into account whether you are using salted butter, and what type of meat you are putting it with (i.e bacon, ham, etc.).  The general contruct the recipe is great though. . . I will definitely use it again.

This was not the perfect hollandaise sauce.  If I have to scale back measurements, it's not a recipe.  This sauce has too much salt and lemon.  There are better recipes on this site with more accurate measurements.

I love hollandaise sauce and this was yucky.  It was grainy, and WAY too salty to use.  And I LOVE salt!  Also if you plan on actually serving this, you better double or triple the recipe.

This recipe was extremely salty and peppery. I thought it looked like too much of each, but the previous reviewers made no mention of it being salty or peppery. I would cut both down to 1/4 tsp.

This was awful.  I should have trusted my gut on the amount of salt and pepper.  It also curdled up on me...  I have made this sauce several times a year and have never had this experience before.  I just came online to get some quick measurements.  It would have been a better experience iff I just eye-balled it.  Those that had a good experience, hey glad to hear it, but I just can't see how it was possible.

This was not good.  I read all the reviews and followed everything.  I did not add salt or pepper, warmed the butter very slowly and added the eggs very slowly using a whisk.  Immediatly is started to seperate, so I removed from heat and added a splash of water and whisked vigorously.  In the end I dumped it out and sent DH to the store for a packet of mix.  Waste of 3 eggs and 1 stick of butter.

This should be called "Salt Lick" sauce.  A teaspoon of salt and pepper make this a bad college prank for a Mother's Day breakfast.  I was only able to salvage the recipe by cutting it with a cup of plain yoghurt.

This recipe is a favorite in our household now.  It's very simple to make and the family says it tastes better than what you get in a restaurant.  I now have to make it on a weekly basis.

This recipe was pretty good.  I didn't add any salt, it was salty enough with the butter.  And I added just a little black pepper.  I also added about 1/8 tsp of worcestershire sauce and about 2 T of water instead of just the 1 tsp that was recommended.  I will definitly make this again.

my first time making this but the butter and lemon ratio to eggs seems off..I would use a double boiler or a bowl over boiling water.. which was my first instinct.. sauce did separate but added water as it said and whisked it in...I'm gonna try it again cutting the butter and lemon in half and salt and pepper to taste at the end...Trial and error...

It broke.  I followed the recipe, including the commenters' tips about seasoning to taste and the author's tip to add water and stir if it breaks.  

I had poured the mealy mess into a bowl, not sure what I was going to do with it.  I added a third teaspoon of cold water and whisked (off the heat) and it still wouldn't come together.  After a while I gave it one last vigorous whisk and it went from being tiny egg particles floating in butter to being a semi-emulsion- looking a bit like a thick, grainy gravy.  

I used it anyway, but I wouldn't try this again.

The best recipe, so easy and it tastes so good! My boyfriend doesn't usually like hollandaise sauce but loved this one! Salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. Don't listen to negative reviews. It is a great recipe!!

The Directions on how to make this recipie were nice and simple, however the ingredients are not very correct. The recipie ingredients need to be tweaked for it to turn out nicely. If not it tends to be either to salty or lemony.

The ingredient amounts noted in this recipe are incorrect.  Change to 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper at most, add by taste is best. Depending on lemon size - use juice of one small lemon or 1/2 of very large lemon.  Better yet view the other recipes on allrecipes.com for correct ingredients and measurements.

Okay, so this was my first time making Hollandaise sauce.. I followed the recipe exactly except for the salt and pepper amounts as per reviews. The sauce broke appox. three mins into my constant whisking despite the addition of cold water I had on hand just in case.. not sure where I went wrong, I think I'll cheat next time with a blender recipe.

this was my first time making Hollandaise and it came out perfectly, thanks! Tasted exactly how Hollandaise should; creamy and a little tart. I always make adjustments to the pepper and salt in pretty much all recipes I try, so I don't think I used the exact amount called for. But I followed the clear directions about whisking it for 8 min. until it thickens, paid attention to the heat of the pan, and it went flawlessly. Was expecting a lot more trouble from a sauce that has a reputation for being a little high maintenance. Probably helped to have very fresh eggs from our 2 backyard hens.

Awful, awful recipe. I used it to make Eggs Benedict and the only reason I finished eating it was because I scraped the sauce off. Way too much salt, too much pepper. The consistency of the sauce was right, but you certainly didn't need to whisk it for 8 minutes, 3 minutes was sufficient.  I actually registered this account just to say how awful the recipe is.

I followed the directions exactly as instructed. The mixture broke apart as soon as it hit the melted butter. Whisked it for 8 min as instructed on low heat. Was getting worse. And the black pepper...come on. Looks and taste nothing like hollandaise sauce. Couldn't save it with the splash water..Would not recommend..sorry :(

I have had several people comment on this being the best hollandaise sauce they've ever had.  As far as it having too much salt/pepper - we add more than the recipe calls for, we like it salty, peppery and with lots of lemon. To all the reviewers who said theirs separated immediately, turn the stove down to avoid this.

i love this sauce and make it often,i gave it only 4 stars b/c if you follow the recipe (salt & pepper) it would be unedable...HOWEVER the method is much easier than the traditional way. this makes the recipe worth adjusting.

WAY TOO MUCH SALT, PEPPER, and LEMON.

 Mine did not thicken, it seperated.  Instructions need to be more clear about how slowly to add the yolks, and what to look for when the sauce gels.

Used farm fresh eggs (from the neighbors chickens!) and extra butter (hubby's idea) and this was fantastic.  Did start to separate, but followed the suggestion to add a little cold water and rapid whisk, and it worked.  Even my kids, who don't like asparagus, ate their veggies!

This sauce was fast and easy!  Got great reviews when served over steamed asparagas.  Thickened up nice - wasn't runny or broken.  It is important to serve it immediately so budget your time to make this the last item you prepare.  I'll make this again when I entertain.

I followed the recipe to the letter, but it never got "thick" like I would have expected. After it sat off the heat, it thickened somewhat. Next time, I will remove from heat and allow to stand a few minutes, but too long as it might seperate. :)

Hollandaise is always a little trickey...if the temperature isnt right it will seperate..which happened to me.  Taking it off the stove and a couple drops of water brought it back to life.

this was simple and delicious.  i omitted the listed amounts of salt and pepper and just added it to taste.  it turned out perfect.  make sure you whisk continuously over low heat, mine only took about three minutes to thicken, not eight.

This recipe is superb.  I found the sauce easy to prepare and tangy as I wanted it to be.  In addition it's easy to memorize as well.

I thought a full teaspoon of salt sounded like a lot. It was WAY too much. If you are using normal, salted butter, skip it altogether.

First batch broke beyond repair when I stopped whisking to set a timer. It was way too salty with 1/3 tsp salt. Second batch with no salt was better...rescued twice with cold water...but not as  or thick as I'd like. I took it off the double boiler frequently when it started to separate. Still a little salty. I'll try one more time, but with unsalted butter and salt to taste. And I'll whisk some of the butter into the eggs to temper them before I add the eggs to the pan.

I always read the reviews before trying a recipe. But was in too much of a hurry tonight. It seized up immediately. I added 4 more egg yolks, more water and a tad more lemon. But it DID come back to life, just not like I'm used to. My other recipe requires you to mix the yolks and water, whisk until frothy, then add the salt, lemon juice and cayanne. Once that's done, add butter a tablespoon at a time. Even with the low stars, I was able to recoup it and save it, it just wasn't as light as I'm used to.

the family loved the recipe....i should have followed my gut like i usually  do and not trust the amount of salt and pepper. i know for next time to cut back on the lemon juice and just salt and pepper to taste. i also use unsalted clarified butter to prevent the sauce from breaking.

I used to make hollandaise sauce all the time. It had been several years so I looked up this recipe. It was the worst hollandaise sauce ever! So super salty!!! I suggest NOT to put salt in hollandaise sauce!

Excellent, fool-proof recipe.  As another reviewer said, good cooks know to season with salt and pepper to taste.  So to all the complainers, I ask you to re-try this recipe with that in mind next time and see if your rating doesn't change.  Very good recipe.  Thanks for posting!!!

I should have read the review by 'Eostar' before preparing this recipe.  The salt and pepper should definitely be added after cooking.  This is a great starting recipe for Hollandaise. I ended up whipping up a few more yolks and adding them to the mixture to cool down the salt.  A few more drops of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp water and I had Hollandaise... still a little salty, but tasty enough to pull off on my fiance.  We had it over Eggs Sardou and enjoyed it very much. Next time I will use unsalted butter and hold off on the salt and pepper.  Perhaps I'll use white pepper... Thank you!

The recipe came out really good for me. I love Hollandaise sauce and never knew how to make it, and it ofcourse goes with my Atkins diet!!  Yes, the person made a mistake in typing the salt-pepper amounts....but it is common sense...all of us make mistakes in typing.  That should not be a criteria for rating the recipe.  On the other hand, I am glad the person took the time and effort to share this recipe with all of us.  Thanks!!!

salt and pepper proportions are WAY off, try 1/4 teaspoon each MAX!!! Otherwise it was decent--make sure to read the tip about what to do if this separates!

Made this and it was DELISH!!  I did modify a bit to my liking and based on other reviews.  I cut down on the salt and pepper.  My three kids ages 7, 5, 3 devoured it and dipped everything on their plate in the sauce.  Definately a keeper in my recipe box.

This sauce turned out GREAT.  The time was perfect--if it's not quite thick at the end of 8 minutes, take it off the heat, it will finish thickening while it cools.  I would use unsalted butter for this recipe, but if you use salted butter, omit the salt.  The sauce wasn't tangy at all, but I used a small, dry lemon.  It was probably about 1 Tb.  Sauces are notoriously hard, so it might take a few attempts and adjustments!!!  Good luck :)

This is awesome! I've been looking a simple hollandaise sauce recipe for a while.  I cut out all but a small pinch of salt, added an extra tsp butter and another tsp water (because it was too thick), and it turned out perfect.  My guests absolutely raved over it, and I'll make it again soon.

This was quick and easy. I recommend having everything’s measured out because it cooks quickly.  I didn’t add the salt and pepper in the eggs.  All I did was add pepper to the top of the Benedict I was making. Got rave reviews on Father’s Day!!! Definitely will make it again. 
Enjoy!!

First time making this. I cut way down on the lemon, salt and pepper. It was just ok. Did break but the water shock saved it. Doubt I’ll make again. It was just missing something compared to some of the great sauces I’ve had.

I love this sauce, remember to taste as you cook and avoid dumping S&P into any recipe from the get go. I recommend starting with 2T. of lemon juice as half a lemon isn't an accurate measurement. I ended up using 5T. but I prefer the lemon to shine in my hollandaise. I also foego the double boiler and use a sauce pan on direct low heat. Be prepared for your sauce to break using this method but the emulsion repair trick at the bottom of the recipe works like a charm everytime.

To salty, to peppery, to sour and too much butter. The worse Hollandaise I ever made. Maybe cut everything in half but the yokes might make it better. No more short cuts for me.

This is the best recipe!! I have never attempted Hollandaise before as I thought it would be way too complicated.I was wrong.This recipe was really easy to follow, and the tip about the cold water-Wow.
Sauce was velvety smooth and had a great taste!!
Family loved it   :-)

I did make some changes.  I backed down salt and pepper to suit my tastes.  I didn't have actual lemons so I used a teaspoon and half of bottled lemon juice.  It was a little on the tart side, so next time I make it, I'll back down on the lemon juice a bit.  Low heat and constant light whisking is key to not breaking it.  Have patience and get someone else to poach the eggs!

Definitely a great, easy to follow, simple recipe. Warning to future cooks of this sauce: If you use salted butter, you do not need to add the tsp of salt! I made the mistake of using salted butter AND adding the salt, so it turned out quite salty. I also became discouraged when my sauce began to separate, but like the footnote says, a good splash (1-2 oz) of cold water helped it thicken up. I will definitely be making this again!

Waayyy too much salt. A dash is all you need. Use a double boiler and mix the butter slowly into the egg yolk mixture.

I will preface this with the fact that I have never eaten eggs benedict nor have I ever made it. My son asked me for it one morning and I thought why the heck not. So I found this recipe and another to learn how to poach eggs.  Normally, follow recipes just as they are. Well, like the others said WAY too much salt and pepper, next time I will just dash it in. I also used unsalted butter so the salt was strictly from the added salt. Also, I used bottled lemon juice, I wasn't sure how much to use exactly, so I started with a 1/4 cup. That was too much. I think next time I will used 2 Tbsps and see how that goes. I like the recipe for it's simplicity and I had no trouble with it thickening. Only the flavor was too strong. So I will cut back next time and make again.

I've had good and bad experiences with this recipe. I always make it on a double boiler, free hand the amount of salt and pepper. My most recent fail at this recipe was either cooking too long, or adding too much cold water, probably the former. It thickened up after only 4 minutes, whisking constantly, but I didn't take it off right away since I needed to take another poached egg out first. Started to look too thick so added some cold water, not long after and everything had separated. Likely just cooked it too long, resulting in the egg yolks cooking. Will use this recipe in the future as the last step in making eggs benedict, but will pour it on immediately once thick!

pretty easy and very good!  just remember to keep whisking!  there will be a brief time when you think you screwed it up, just keep whisking until it is thick and smooth.  also, I found the 1/2 lemon a little much, definitely lemon, salt, & pepper to taste.

I tried twice, once with 1/3 of the recipe which did not work at all, so I tried with the full (bearing in mind that salt & pepper is to taste not 1 tsp each as commenters mentioned). I should have went with my gut because after slowly adding in the egg mixture to the butter I saw a perfect hollandaise sauce in my pot but it wasn't near 8 minutes so I kept going and it separated and was gross :/ 
Tasted a little too lemony, so an actual measurement of how much fresh lemon juice to use would be appreciated. I will try again for my husband. My poached eggs turned out perfectly! So that was one win.

Brutally salty, even after I cut the salt down by half, and also only did several grinds of pepper, certainly not even a whole teaspoon. Maybe they meant to use unsalted butter, but still, this much added salt is way too much. I like a lot of lemon, but this also might be adjusted down by half. My sauce did break, but came back quickly with a little more cold water and fast whisking.

Turned out perfect.    Keep the melted butter / egg mixture pretty low and whisk until thick to avoid breaking.  Also,  go easy on the salt, adding a bit at a time to taste.

The sauce looked awesome, however it was overpowered by the salt and the lemon.   I used a medium sized lemon.   Next time I will eliminate the salt and use about 1/8th of a medium lemon.

Sorry to give this 1 star, but this is the lazy man's way to make hollandaise.  I needed something quick for hubby's breakfast and wasted 5 eggs on this recipe, thought I'd try the easy way out.  UGH!

All who says it's perfect have not had really amazing hollandaise from scratch, it takes time and it's worth the effort.  

I attached a pic, it broke apart, even with the added "secret to save it", and the recipe should have indicated salt & pepper to taste. It also never thickened up and the color was a spicy mustard color rather than the creamy lemon yellow it should be.

Note: There are going to be people searching for recipes who have NEVER made the sauce before so the salt & pepper amounts should be changed.  Easy edit.

Save yourself the disappointment from your family and choose another recipe, any *classic* recipe that takes 10 minutes to cook, skip it.

In the end, it turned out great!  Started to seperate almost immediately.  I'm thinking my pot was too hot.  To save my sauce, I added 1-2 tsp BOILING water, as I needed, almost immediately it began to get creamy.  KEEP stirring cause as it cools, it will seperate!

Literally couldn't eat it. If you take this recipe at face value it is inedible. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR YOLKS!

It was WAY TOO SALTY. 

If you dial it back to MAYBE a 1/4 to 1/8 teaspoon of salt it would be GREAT!

Too late for me. I learned the hard way. Ruined breakfast for me and my spouse. If this recipe were updated. It might save people a lot of ill feelings and may even get better ratings.

3 stars for ease of cooking, 2 stars off for the overly lemony finish. Even after reading reviews, I still added the lemon, thinking it was small enough (and I like lemon) but no. Next time I'll leave it out entirely. I don't care what recipes say about salt and pepper - mine goes on at the table, so that wasn't an issue. I see what people mean about separation but, hey, it will still taste the same. For my first attempt at hollandaise, if say not too bad.

as written I could only give it 3 stars, but it is a great start!!  Mine ended curdling, so I added one more egg yolk and maybe another 1-2 TBS softened butter.  The taste testing part is where you should go with what you like!!  I added the other half of the lemon as I like mine VERY tart.  I also added cayenne pepper, white pepper, Cajun seasoning, and salt (I had  used unsalted butter which I don't normally do.  I think I will stick with the salted kind, which would make additional salt unnecessary)

Wayy too much salt & pepper!! I had to dbl the butter, yokes and lemon and it was still too salty. When I make this agian I will only use a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. That being said, it was very simple to make.

This sauce was super great. I made it this morning for my family. It brought back memories of my childhood when my mother would make it .  Especially on cold  winter  mornings  it would warm my tummy.  Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe; although I  didn't add the salt, it still turned out fantastic.

Good basic recipe but could be improved.  Made it today and it was pretty good but too salty.  I would recommend starting with a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and substitute white pepper for black pepper. Also used unsalted butter which was noted by another reviewer.

I have made this many times and it turns out perfectly every time!  I didn't have unsalted butter so did not add salt to the recipe.  Other than that, I don't know what the complaints are about.  I find this recipe much easier and faster than others recipes and no double boiler!  My daughter even said I didn't make a big deal out of it while cooking it; I knew it would turn out perfectly!

I used lemon juice from a bottle, though none of these reviews gave a sense of how much, so I started light with 1 TSP.  Made the recipe and watched it break apart as I took it off the heat.  Tasted it and it was not very lemony so took the bottle back out of the fridge and put another 2 to 3 TSP of lemon juice in and as I stirred the sauce came together beautifully.

Went pretty good. I didn't have a whisk however even though it broke apart I was able to beat it back together with rapid stirs of my spoon. I did have to tweak the end result a little to my taste but I a, satisfied with the results and look forward to trying it again with a whisk.

I am a lemon fan and this sauce didn't meet my lemon taste buds. I used lemon juice from a bottle and couldn't taste it very much (used about 3 tsp). And there was way too much salt asked for this recipe. I would cut it in half. But the texture of the sauce turned out perfectly.

Very nice.  I treated my wife to eggs benedict this morning.  The sauce was creamy with a hint of lemon.  I garnished with parsley. The sauce emoulsified to about 2-3 times its original mass.  I also used Smart Balance butter to ease the fat content.  The sauce came out great !

Too much salt.  

Otherwise, great.  Try just adding a sprinkle of salt and pepper instead and add more at the end if needed.

I agree that this is the most simple sauce and also very tasty. Use a small lemon as it can be over powering if you use too much.

This was my first time making any hollandaise, and it came out perfect. I used a double boiler on medium-low instead of a saucepan on low. It's wonderful on fresh steamed asparagus.

Perfect!  I had no problem with the sauce separating, and everyone raved that it is MUCH better than what they have had at restaurants.
