Love this recipe!  It's the best recipe I've found for using left-over turkey.  I substituted 1 box of Jiffy corn bread mix for the refrigerator rolls and just spread it over the top before baking.  No adjustments to baking temp or time were needed.  Added diced corn and some left-over beans the 2nd time I made this, then froze serving sized portions.  It reheats well, covered with a paper towel, in the microwave.

Not sure what I was expecting, but it was better than I could have imagined.  I did add peas and dice carrots along with the corn.  My family loved and the leftovers were good for lunch the next day.

This was mediocre at best. I added celery, onions and carrots, but it was still just not "all that" I like the idea of the cornbread topping, (I put actually cornbread batter on top)maybe I will make it again using the usual pot pie veggies and maybe doing a from  scratch filling

Great and tasty way to make a cornbread pot pie with some leftover turkey. I used this recipe and substituted one package of Jiffy corn muffin mix for the refrigerated cornbread twists and just spread it on (prepared as directed on the Jiffy box) and it turned out great! Will make again next Thanksgiving, or the next time I cook up a turkey.

This is NOT a family favorite. It has a okay taste but as far as the family goes, we're going back to the old pot pie standby.

This was great!  I doubled the recipe used a frozen mixed veggie and used the Jiffy Cornbread for the topping... Husband and kds loved it. Great quick recipe that will definitely make it into my rotations :). Thanks!

I made this with Jiffy cornbread mix and the cornbread topping may have been a little too sweet. I liked this recipe and it was a great way to use some leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Very easy to make and kid friendly.

maybe it was because I used jiffy mix and poured it over top. It WAS pretty, golden brown, and SO easy (plus I had all the ingredients) so I had high hopes, but, I have to share this for those who are looking at this recipe and maybe sitting on the fence about it (like I did)- we did not care for it. but thats just one opinion.

Outstanding use for leftover Turkey.  This was LOVED by one and all.  No adjustments or changes needed IMO.

A good way to use turkey leftovers. I didnt have any cornbread twists so i used Pillsbury biscuits. I cooked for 15 mins then had to turn biscuits over and cook another 10-15 mins. Was OK but not anywhere near wonderful!

My husband gave this dish a big thumbs up. After reading all the reviews and previous knowledge of what cream of chicken soup tastes like I added a lg sauted shallot and sauted chopped carrot, more than 1/2 tps of pepper some smoked paprika and garlick powder. Made home made corn bread batter and poured it on top of the casserole . Baked as directed

I followed this recipe except I used a whole chicken instead. It really had no flavor. Its not a keeper in my recipe box:(
