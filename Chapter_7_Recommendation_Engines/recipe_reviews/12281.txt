It was good, but very bland.  After following feedback from other reviewers, I added 1/2 cup of milk, and used low fat soup - these made for a great consistency.  I used corn and peas, but next time I'll try adding try mushrooms and carrots with it.  I'll also add 1/2 tsp. of marjoram, 1/4 tsp. of salt, onion flakes, and a dash of parsley to spice it up.  Very easy, and worth keeping!

This was great!!  I tweeked the recipe a bit though.  I used rotisserie chicken instead of the breasts for added flavor.  I also used 2 cans of cr of chicken soup with 1 pkg frozen mixed veggies rather than canned.  I added salt, pepper and ground thyme to taste and used 2 pkgs of rolled out Pilsbury cresent rolls instead of pie crust.  It was excellent!  I would definately make this again!

I followed the recipe closely, and it was so easy and yummy! Both my husband and I loved it. Leftovers are also good. :-) Crust: I bought a package of two frozen deep dish pie crusts. I left one in the foil "pan" and took the other one out of its container (after letting it thaw a bit). I poured all the ingredients in the one I left in the pan, then I kind of flattened the other crust and tore it as needed to cover the top. I crimped and cut slits as suggested. EDIT: I've since made this recipe again, and I now use the Walmart brand or Pillsbury brand refrigerated dough that's by the canned biscuits and cinnamon rolls. Chicken: I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts. I used a skillet and boiled the chicken in water with 1 chicken bouillion cube, turning as needed to cook both sides. EDIT: I've also used leftover grilled chicken, which was equally as good.

Wow!  This was delicious!  It was so easy that I had to try it and knew it would be good, but I didn't expect it to be great.  I did add one extra can of soup (I used 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of celery).  I also used frozen veggies - carrots, peas & corn - instead of canned (I just boiled them for a minute in the chicken stock leftover from cooking the chicken).  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.  Thanks!

I made my own crust, used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom, and then used frozen veggies.  I also added some salt, pepper, a little garlic powder, thyme, and some Lawry's seasoned salt.  Really easy, and turned out great.  My whole family loved it.

Wow...I've attempted chicken pie before and had terrible results but not this time.  Delicious!!  I made a ton of tweaks, so many that I'm not sure if what I made is really the same recipe anymore.  I heated two cans of soup (cream of chicken and cream of chicken with herbs) thinned with some milk and stock and made an additional sauce with 1/3 cup butter, 1/3 cup flour (whisked together and cooked for 2 minutes), 1 and 3/4 cup chicken stock, 3/4 cup milk, salt, pepper, celery seed and fresh thyme.  I wanted to be sure I had tons of gravy.  Once I mixed all that together I reserved a third of it to top the pie and mashed potatoes with.  I cook up a chopped onion, 3 ribs of celery and 3 shredded carrots in some butter. I then sliced up a roast chicken and boiled and chopped up 2 potatoes. I threw all that in along with a can of peas.  Now I had enough for two pies.  I put 1/2 the filling in the freezer for next time.  Used 2 deep dish ready made crusts.  One I poked holes in and flashed baked for 10 minutes at 350 and the other I used to top it all, giving it an egg wash and cutting some holes in the top.  Cooked at 350 until golden.

This will be a regular dish in our home.

I just did not like this recipe. It would have been alright if I had used fresh vegetables. The problem was the canned veges, they made it taste awful. My husband thought it was ok but I couldn't eat mine. I doubt I'll ever make it again.

This recipe was not bad for a weeknight supper, however it was definetly nothing really special.  I thought that it tasted like eating a can of soup with chicken and vegetables in it.  I like lots of sauce in my chicken pot pie and I felt that 1 can of soup did not make enough sauce for the pie. I added an extra half can and I think next time I will add fat free sour cream instead of the extra soup and a few tablespoons of white wine. I think I will also try making it with puff pastry. I also added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder and some fresh ground pepper.  I used the half fat soup and I feel this worked well.

I found the a lot of these reviews to be incredibly rude and condescending.  For one thing, most reviewed something they DIDN'T COOK!  That is a huge pet peeve for me.  There are plenty of people that appreciate the ease of this recipe and I'm one of them.  I have tried this and during the winter it's a go-to recipe for me and my family.  I do replace the canned vegetables with frozen or fresh vegetables, but follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  I usually make 2 at once and freeze one.  With a full time job and a family with limited time, I think this recipe is a winner and doesn't make whoever created it "lazy". Thank you Sharon for posting it and know that not everyone shares the feelings of the opinionated reviewers who are reviewing something based on their own 'nose in the air' mentality

I'm always looking for new chicken recipes, and I was skeptical when I found this one. I made it last night and it was excellent. I tweeked it a little:
I added 1 can sweet cord
1 big handful of sweet baby carrots
1 large potato (diced)
a few shakes of celery salt and pepper
a few shakes of dehydrate onion
4 cloves of roasted garlic (sliced thin)

It was EASY and yummy!

I like to try the recipes as presented but found this quite bland for our taste and would give it 2.5 stars.  The 2nd time I made this dish I made my own cream of chicken soup (recipe from here) I added fresh thin sliced carrots, frozen petit peas, red bell pepper & baby spinach.  I spiced it up considerably with spices to our taste and added some green parsley from my garden.  Awesome and the end result 5 stars

So, of course I tweaked the recipe.......used 2 cans of cream of chicken plus 1/2 can chicken broth, 1 bag of frozen mixed vegies that I boiled in seasonings first.  Added trader joe's 21 spice salute and some extra poultry seasoning and dill.........Really, Really Good......I will most certainly make this again...... So simple....Try it....just add some seasoning.

Simply great! I used 2 chicken breasts because I was only serving for 2, then I cut the raw chicken into small pieces and then put into 1 can of boiling chicken broth with added spices for taste. Let simmer until all the way cooked. In another pan I boiled mixed frozen veggies. Then I combined chicken, veggies, 2 cans of creme of chicken and a small amount of broth. Added more spices for flavor. Then I used a box of pillsbury crust and followed directions on the box. I baked bottom crust for 8 min first before adding mixture. Added the mixture and top layer of crust and baked for about 25 min. (Everything was cooked already so it shortens baking time) During the last few min of baking I brushed on a beaten egg to crust to make golden brown. So good!

Easy as pie! The tastiness of the chicken depends on how season it as you cook it. We like to pull apart a roasted chicken from the grocery store to save time! We also throw in a can of cream of potato soup with the cream of chicken. Add a couple of tablespoons of milk to thin it all down. We also add a little crushed pepper and a bit of garlic salt. Make sure to cut slits at the top of the pie to let out the steam or the inside will be runny.

Awesome. The whole family liked this meal. I also enjoyed the leftovers. They were just as good the second time. I used frozen veggies since I didn't have canned and that was fine, too. I'll definitely make this again.

As written I give it a 3 star.  It is a good recipe.  I usually don't make recipes that call for cans of soup.  However this one looked quick and easy, so I tried it as written and I did find it to be a bit bland, for my taste, however all good cooks take a good recipe and make it better (according to their tastes and make it their own)  The version I made last night was made with these changes - 2 cans of chicken - 1 can of cream of celery - 1 cup of chicken gravy (made from the powder stuff - poultry seasoning- pepper - fresh cut carrots, diced potatoes -parsnips and green beans, parboiled.  I mixed everything in together and poured it into the pie crust and baked it for about an hour.  I used Pillsbury pie crust.  This tasted as wonderful as it smelled.  Thank you Sharon for sharing such a good recipe that is so versatile and easy!!!!
Update:  January 2013.  I made this again last night.  This time I roasted potatoes, onions, parsnips and carrots and 3 diced chicken breast on my stone baking sheet.  I drizzled them all in olive oil and seasoned with poultry seasoning - garlic and onion powder salt and pepper.  I only roasted them for about 30 minutes at 350.  I then took 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of chicken added them to 2 cups hot chicken gravy as stated above.  Poured veggies into sauce - stirred well and poured sauce into 2 pie shells.  I made one pie for company and froze the other.  Heavenly pie!

Very bland recipe - if you steam the chicken with a little bit of water/chicken bouillon, garlic, onion, pepper, thyme, rosemary, sage, basil and fennel, you have a great start.  I advise using fresh or frozen veggies to eliminate all the sodium that is in canned veggies.  With that said, you have a wonderful dish that was worth the extra effort!

I have to say that I am growing weary of the number of 'recipes' that are little more than opening a few cans and adding some meat. I rated this 'list of instructions' as a 2-star so that I wouldn't throw off the average rating too much, but honestly, combining canned vegetables with a can of condensed soup and some boiled chicken sounds disgusting, and I certainly don't need to look up a recipe on the internet to throw it together. At least use fresh veggies, chicken stock, some onion, celery and carrots, add some spices, and wine. I simply don't understand how a recipe like this can get so many rave reviews... if you have to change the recipe to make it palatable, then its your recipe that deserves the accolades, not the original.

This recipe was quick and easy! Everyone loved it, I made 2 pies and for both used canned peas and corn and added cut carrots. In the 1 pie I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can chicken gravy. In the other I used 1 can of campbells chunky broccoli and cheese soup that had potatoes in it. Also added garlic powder to both. They were amazing!!!

This was a great base recipe. I've never made chicken pot pie and it turned out great! I first cooked the chicken in onion and garlic and used all fresh vegetables, except the canned peas. I also used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. My family loved it!

This is a really good base recipe.  I added a few important things and made this a 5 star!  I started out making a bechamel (white) sauce.  Melt 3T of butter in a heavy bottomed pot and add 2T flour.  Cook that together for a couple of minutes and then add milk, salt, and pepper until you get to a consistancy you like. Then I added 2 half inch slices of Velveeta (diced) to the sauce and let it melt and stir.  In a skillet I sauteed some diced onions, a little garlic and some chicken thigh strips.  After the chicken was browned I added some broccoli florets.  In the meanwhile I added a can of cream of chicken soup, a little more milk, and 2 cans of mixed vegetables to the cream mixture.  In a 9x13 dish I poured the chicken and broccoli mixture in.  After spreading it with a large spoon I then poured the cream mixture over the chicken.  Lastly I took a container of grande biscuits, sliced them all in half horizontally and topped the dish.  Put it in the oven at 385 and baked til the biscuits were golden.  OMG yummmmmm.  I'm begged to make this at least once a week.  Very light on the pocketbook too!

Try this with a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup- yum!  Also in a pinch canned chicken (found near tuna fish) will work as a substitute and save you a lot of time.

Definitely add more spices - I add freshly ground pepper and thyme.   Sometimes I use celery soup in place of the chicken, but most any "cream of" soup will work.  I also use a can of chicken if I am really in a hurry.

This was so simple! I'm not the best cook, but this was easy to put together. Both my husband and I work late on Fridays (after 8:30 pm), and this came together fast. I added garlic salt and Mrs Dash chicken grilling blend. I'll try a different Mrs Dash next time. We liked it, and so did my 20-year-old daughter!

very good.  i had more diced chicken than called for so I only used one can of veggies (this was a good change as I love chicken and cut down on the canned veggie taste).  the only resaon I gave it four stars instead of five was because it wasn't SUPER AWESOME, but for how easy it was and the dish still being tasty, I will make again!

This is a winter regular at our house.  Definitely use 2 cans of soup (heart healthy low sodium) and a splash or 2 of milk.  We use 2/3 bag of frozen mixed veggies, shredded cheddar and even a cup of cooked rice on occasion.  Add pepper.  Serve with a salad.  Easy and very tasty!!

Excellent with adjustments.  Cooked chicken in chicken broth, used frozen veggies, used 2 cans of cream of whatever we had in the cupboard, 1/4 cup milk, and 1/4 cup chicken broth leftover from cooking chicken.  Spices added: garlic powder, salt, pepper, and palm full of Mrs. Dash. Roommate approves.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I have never made a "quickie" chicken pot pie in my life. I always cook mine from scratch. But I was looking for ways to use up some leftover chicken and a refrigerated pie crust purchased from the "reduced" section at the local grocery. I stumbled across this recipe. So, I thought "Why not?" This is one of those recipes that should be entitled "chicken pot pie your way." As with all recipes, I tweaked it a bit to make it my own. And this one turned out fabulously. After reading the reviews, here's what I came up with: Mixed soup with milk in a large bowl, per some reviewers. Added a generous splash of white wine, 1 chopped onion and 1 potato,cubed.Followed by the leftover chicken (cubed), and frozen mixed vegetables until the amounts looked right. Many people complained that the recipe was bland, so I seasoned the filling with poultry seasoning, salt & pepper. Spooned it into the bottom crust in a deep dish pie plate. Topped with the 2nd crust and cut 4 vents. Baked, covered with foil for about 30-35 minutes. Removed the foil and brushed the top with a beaten egg. Returned to the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until it was a pretty golden brown. Even with the changes,the dish cost under $5. A great way to stretch my budget. Thanks for sharing.

All of the adult and older kids loved this, everyone went up for 2nds.  The younger kids didn't like the way it looked and refused to try it.  I double the recipe and added a can of cream of onion to feed a group of 12.

This was a pretty easy/simple recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs rather than breast because that part of the chicken has better flavor and is better in cooking stew like mixtures. Definitely used more seasons because I could tell this was bland without it. I added a can of cream of mushroom, onion, rosemary, salt, pepper, and a little thyme. I covered the chicken cuts in flour and some seasoning salt before lightly sauteeing it with the soups and seasonings. I didn't bother to cook the chicken before putting it in the oven.

Made it last night.  This was a great recipe and will definitely make again and again.  So glad I signed up to get these daily recipes.  Read a ton of other reviews before attempting to make it as directed (always recommend you do this).  I had just purchased the Ronco Rotisserie & BBQ Oven and made a a chicken on Sunday so I used the meat from this.  Then used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery; 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup chicken stock; 2T of white wine and some garlic and onion powder, fresh ground black pepper, dried Thyme and Marajom (sp)...these spices I just eyeballed vs. measure 1/4-1/2 tsp each.  Put all those ingredients on stove and simmered to mix.  Bought already made store brand pie crusts in refridgerator section at grocery store.  While sauce was simmering took 1st crust and put on bottom and placed into preheated 350 oven for 8-10 min.  Thawed some frozen corn and peas and added them to sauce along w/chicken that i basically just tore w/my hands.  When 1st crust was done put the filling in and covered with 2nd crust.  Put 4 vents in top and baked for 30 min.  Also did egg wash per other viewers.  Was really yummy and made a lot.  Try it and enjoy!

I make this with undiluted can of cream of mushroom soup...more flavor.  If you're too lazy to make regular pie crust...you can substitute with a can of Pillsbury rolls.  Press about 1/2 on bottom of pie plate and make a lattice top with the rest.

I love pot pie!!!  Okay, I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because with a few additional ingredients it becomes much tastier - some thyme, oregano, fresh ground pepper.  Also, rather than canned veggies I've found that frozen veggies retain more flavor.  I just pop them into the microwave and defrost them, add the soup (I use two cans of whatever combo is available,) spices, throw together a crust and this dish is yummy!!

This is a great starter recipe for Chicken Pot Pie.  Next time I cook this I will use fresh and/or frozen vegetables.  I just was not a fan of the can taste.  Instead of boiling the chicken breasts I cooked them in a frying pan with some garlic powder to give a little bit more flavor to the chicken.  4 stars for the simplicity of the recipe, but minus one for the taste.

Although i don't think this is a great recipe, it did inspire me to make many modifications and of course after reading several of the reviews, i got some extra good advice. I used only 1 can of condensed chicken soup and about half a carton of chicken stock (Progresso, low sodium).  Yeah, and the pie - Pillsbury crust. I used all fresh veggies: sugar snap peas (sweet w/ a slight crunch), potatoes, onions, celery and carrots. To spice it up some, I used fresh taragon, dried dill and Penzy's Paris spice. Oh, and also used cooked chicken too - of course.

This was fantastic - I did what a couple other reviewers said and used two cans of cream of chicken - as well as a bag of frozen veggies (broccoli, corn, red peppers). I cut one medium potato into small chunks, boiled and drained them, and added them as well. Finally, I used about 1/2 of the meat from a rotisserie chicken instead of the breasts - I threw everything together into a bowl with some spices and then into the pie dish (and I used prepared Pillsbury crust for that), and baked it according to the recipe. It made the entire house smell wonderful, and it's one leftover that didn't last very long.

I am SO EXCITED about this recipe. I followed the other reviewers' advice and used a can of cream of chicken AND a can of cream of celery (PERFECTION!). I used a bag of frozen peas and carrots that I gently cooked in the chicken stock that I had leftover from poaching my chicken breasts. One user suggested using the ready-to-bake pie crusts in the Pillsbury biscuit section, which I did, and it was easy to use and tasty to boot! Next time I will use more chicken, as I used two whole frozen chicken breasts, which were on the smaller size. I used a glass 9.5in baking pan and there wasn't quite as much filling as I'd have liked... the taste is AMAZING though! I sampled the filling while I was preparing it to go in the oven to see if it needed any additional spices and I had to resist eating it right out of the pot, lol... Thanks for a great recipe that I will am looking forward to using again... and again... and again!

I have made this three times now, using left over turkey from the holidays and I really like it!  I use frozen veggies (Bird's Eye) and boil them in chicken broth for a couple of minutes. Add cooked turkey, put in thawed pie crusts,  and dinner...easy and delicious!

"Better than Marie Calendar's!!" is what my husband said the first time I made this recipe. The second time I made it he thanked me - twice -for the "great dinner!" 
The only alterations I made, as reviewers suggested, were: *2 cans of soup  *FRESH veggies (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, green beans)  *purchased prepared pie crusts. 
I boiled the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, whole allspice, bayleaf, garlic, onion, whatever seasonings appeal to me on that day - as if making stock. When chicken is cooked I remove it from the pot, strain the stock and return it to the pot. I blanch the veggies in this liquid for about three minutes before adding them to the chicken/soup mixture. Yummy tender-crisp veggies, creamy chicken, flaky crust. A salad on the side. Comfort food at it's best.

I have made this dish 3 times. It is excellent each time. The only change I made was to dice the chicken breast then bread the breast and fry until golden brown. I believe that this adds an additional flavor to the recipe. I'm not a big fan of boiling any meat.

Great chicken pot pie recipe.  I used frozen mixed vegies, cooked them for a few minutes with the chicken as it was boiling.   Then drained them and diced the chicken.  I mixed this with 2 cans of soup, one cream of chicken and one cream of celery.  I added a 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp parsley.   It makes enough for 2 pies.  I put one in a frozen pie crust and one with Pillsbury crescent rolls formed to fit the bottom of a pie plate and the points brought up to meet at the top.  Cooked the one with Pillsbury crescent roll dough at 375 for 30 minutes and the other for 45 minutes.  I would make this recipe again.

I really loved just how simple this recipe really was. I'm 5 mo pregnant right now so anything I can whip together that's tasty is appreciated. This was perfect! I kept to the recipe except I used chicken tenderloins instead of the breast b/c they cook up faster and pulled the chicken apart rather than dicing it. Then before I added it with the veggies, I mixed the chicken around in McCormick's season all seasoned salt. It was just the right touch. I also cooked it at 400 for only about 30 min and it came out golden brown and perfectly flakey. I will definitely be making this again!

This almost exactly how I have made my chicken pot pie for years and it is one of my husband's favorites.  I make this almost every time I have left over chicken.  I add 1 can of Cream of Potato soup, because my husband loves extra potatoes.  I warm the filling ingredients in a saucepan before I pour it into the pie crust.  I know it is an extra pan to wash, but it seems to bake the crust better if the filling starts out warm.  I add some season salt, garlic powder and onion powder or onion flakes to taste.

I have been using this recipe for a long time. One thing I would like to mention is that for the crust I've always used a Bisquick or Jiffy batter to make a top crust. Turns out excellent!

I made this with two cans of chicken, two cans of cream of mushroom, a bag of frozen peas and carrots that were thawed with lots of seasonings and of course, the pie crust.   I got two big filling meals from this.   The first I tried to make the chicken pot pie with. It wasn't the best. the pie crust was doughy. It had good intentions of working but it wasn't how I thought it should be.   since I was unable to fit all the "filling" into the "pie" I saved it for the next meal. Where I cooked the filling over the stove and poured it onto Grands Biscuits... nothing yummier than Biscuits and gravy! Oh that was really yummy, a very good comfort food on a cold night!

EXCELLENT!!!  I used frozed mixed veggies, frozen chopped onions, a can of mushrooms and a can of chicken.  I boiled that in chicken broth and a can of cream of chicken soup.  I let that reduce, then added the flour and milk.  Like others, I baked the bottom crust for 8 min, then added the chicken mixture and the top crust and baked for 375 for 40 min.  It turned out perfect!!!!  None left!!!!

I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because you MUST add seasonings for this to not be bland!  I didn't boil my chicken, I baked it, sealing it in aluminum foil to trap in the moisture.  I added the chicken stock from the baked chicken as well.  I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, thyme, garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added seasoning salt to the mixture but not much.  Also use frozen veggies instead of canned. Your vegetables will be more firm but cooked.

This is an easy and delicious meal to make on those cold nights that you are looking for something homey. I added 1/2 cup of milk to the soup and includeded potatoes, diced onions and stuffing to the mix. This turned out amazing - will definately be making this again throughout the colder months.

This is a very easy recipe.  I use the same ingredients, but instead of canned vegetables I use frozen.  I also use 1 can of cream of potato in addition to the cream of chicken. Sometimes I use 2 cans of potato and no chicken.

Made this yesterday using frozen veggies and 2 cans cream of chicken soup, because we love the gravy. I used one soup can filled half way (approx 5 oz) with 1/2 n 1/2 poured into a Mrs Callenders pie crust and we couldn't stop eating it! Both my husband and I loved it so much that we had it for lunch and dinner. Would definitely make this again! Thank for submitting.

My family loves my chicken pot pie recipe. I use 2 cans of cream of chicken with herb soup and 1 bag of frozen mixed vegetables.with the chicken. You can add chopped celery for texture. I heat all the ingredients before putting it in the pie shell so it heats up faster. It is delicious.

Honestly I can't really rate this recipe because I didn't make it exactly but, I did come up with this basic idea on my own. My version differs because I use prepared crusts, 2 cans of soup, and I add small chunks of par-boiled potatoes. Oh and I season with garlic powder, onion powder, and fresh ground pepper.

LOVED IT! The only thing i added was a half cup of milk and prebaked the bottom crust for 15 minutes before filling. (as advised in the reviews) Came out great! Husband loved it and said the leftovers were even better. I will definitely be making this again and again!

I used a rotisserie chicken, deboned, and added 1/3 can water, seasoning salt, black pepper, and thyme to the mix for a better flavored filling.  Also, oppose to dumping the uncooked filling in the shell, I heated it on the stovetop with veggies, seasoning, and meat while baking the unfilled bottom crust for 10 min. Then, I filled the partially baked bottom crust added top unbaked crust and baked for 30 minutes.

Delicious and so easy a kid can make it!  My 8 year old made this dish herself while I watched.  She even made the pie crust herself from a box of Jiffy.  The only thing I did was help her get the crust in the pie pan evenly and then take the finished dish out of the oven.  She even cooked the chicken and chopped it when it cooled.  We did use frozen veggies, though.  I think canned mixed are mushy.  Our family of 5 ate the whole thing and wished there was more.  You can adjust any spices to your liking (we added garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, and thyme), it's one of those basic recipes that has a lot of potential for becoming a very different dish with a few minor changes.  Change to steak and or ground beef and add kidney beans and a dash of tex-mex seasoning and red peppers or jalapenos for a mexican dish, or just use whatever ingredients you happen to have on hand.  I can't wait to use this as a base and get creative next time!

I'm rating this a five for when I used all fresh vegetables.  I have made it following the recipe and it is not nearly as good.  The canned vegetables turn to mush and it wasn't as flavourful.  My suggestions: use all fresh vegetables, add poultry seasoning, thyme, parsley and concentrated chicken oxo.  Add about 2 tbsp flour to soup mixture to help thicken.  I'm confident enough with these changes to serve this to company.

For something so simple this was amazing! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and it had sooo much flavor. I will definitely do this again.

My family said this was the BEST pot pie ever!  I boiled a whole chicken and made two pies (*could have spread it out and made three).  I used pillsbury pie crust and pre-baked the bottom crust for 10 mins. @350. Added the following seasoning: 1/2 tsp pepper, thyme, tarragon, garlic powder. I omitted the milk and used 2 cans of soup: Cr. of chicken & Cr. of Potatoe. Brushed the top crust with egg for nice color. Yummy!  *If making 3 pies would add can of diced potatoes to make go further.  For my family of 5 it took two pies!

This turned out great.  I used fresh veggies, cooked them along with the chicken cubes (sauted), par baked a potatoe in the microwave and cubed that, used 2 cans soup (cr. chick. & cr. mushrm).  Mixed together, pour into prepared crust, top with crust and bake 375, 45 min.  Hubby loved it.

This is so easy, but just to make it easier I cook a small chicken in the slow cooker until it practically shreds itself.  I also add some sage, thyme and rosemary just to make it a bit more tasty.  Everyone loves it.

I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken, some seasoning, a half can of milk, and frozen mixed veggies instead of canned.  Turned out really good. Had to cook a little longer than 45 minutes. More like 55. This thing is huge! It weighs at least a few pounds!

I used frozen mixed vegetables and put a crust on the top and bottom. My family loves this!  When i made this again.. yesterday I used a 11 x 13 pan and just bought two packages of pie crust and made it huge. It was just as great. It has truly become a family favorite!

This recipe is a good base recipe -- it's up to you to be creative and add to it!  You can adjust things like the types of veggies, the spices, etc.  I find that two large breasts sauteed with onion work well, along with a small pkg of frozen mixed veggies, poultry seasoning and pepper.  If I have it, I add about a half a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, too.  I also use two cans of low-fat cream of chicken.  Brush some egg yolk on the top crust to brown it. Great!

I've been making a variation of this for years.  What I do differently:  either use left-over roast chicken, rotisserie chicken from market, or saute chicken breasts seasoned with poultry seasoning, use 1 can of cream of potato soup and just a bit of milk (1/4 cup or less), and one can of veg-all mixed veggies (drained).  Bake at 400 for 45 minutes or until browned and bubbly.

This was really good.  I used frozen mixed vegetables and fat free cream of chicken soup.  I also diced and sauted the chicken instead of boiling it.  I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash and garlic.

I used a frozen pie crust.  And I don't have canned mixed veggies around so I used a combination of fresh & frozen.  I didn't think it was *that* easy --pie crusts are never fun, even the frozen kind.  I also thought this somewhat boring -- I continued to add salt, pepper and poultry seasoning to it as I ate it so as to "do" something to it.  As usual, I am rating the recipe, not what I did to fix it.  (And it was still a 3 anyway.)  I won't make it again.  Also, there's issues with the recipe.  Obviously this is a two-crust pie shell, not a single.  And the filling is enough for TWO pies, so I ended up with twice as much as what I'd intended, and not knowing it wasn't too exciting, went ahead and made two.

Overall, I really liked this pot pie! I did make some changes and added garlic powder, salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, basil and parsley. I used a can of mushroom soup instead of the milk, frozen peas and carrots instead of canned vegetables, and sauteed some celery and onion and added it to the filling as well. Poking some holes in the bottom crust and cooking it for 10 min. at 350 first was a great idea. Brushing the top crust with beaten egg to give it a nice golden color was also a great tip. I did have to cook the pie an extra 45 min. because 30 min. was not enough time. This recipe will be added to my favorites!

My first try at chicken pot pie, could not believe how easy it was and very good. Minor changes, seasoned chicken breast with Montreal Chicken Seasoning and pan seared before I cut into cubes, used one can on cream of chicken & muchroom soup and one can on cream of celery along with 1/2 cup of half and half. Used frozen mixed vegetables and blanched before use. Added a pinch of tyme and salt and pepper to taste. Egg wash on top of crust and baked for 1 hour.

My picky children LOVE this, I almost have to make a pie for each of them.  I used perdue shortcuts (all ready cooked chicken) and a bag of frozen soup vegetables (I had to pick out the okra, but it had potatoes in it).  I went outside and handed the recipe to my non-cooking neighbor - she made it for her children & they loved it as well.  Thanks Sharon!!

I have been using this recipe since 2011. It's a great basic recipe that I always turn to.  You can make variations to it as your time allows such as sauteing the chicken with your favorite seasonings or using a store bought rotisserie chicken and taking the pieces off the bone, exchanging the canned vegetables for your favorite frozen or fresh vegetables.

I always use the Family Size Cream of Mushroom or Cream of Chicken Soup and season the mixture with whatever spices I feel like.

I also used the Pillsbury Ready Made Pie Crusts because I'm no pastry chef.

I have read some reviews and people complaining about how store bought this is.  I am sure there are a lot of working moms that find this easy to put on the table after a long day of work.  But really a nice roux and some chicken stock with maybe a little half and half is almost as easy.   I didn't make it they way she did but I did take help from the frozen food section with frozen mixed veggies.   And poaching the chicken for this is great but remember to add onions, celery, carrots and herbs to your poaching liquid and use that as your stock.   It is really worth putting a few minutes extra time for something like this.

This is a wonderful base recipe for easy comfort food!  I used frozen vegetables, 2 tsp of our favorite poultry seasoning, 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken, rotisserie chicken, and store made pie crusts.  So easy and tastes fantastic!  My family thought it was all home made! ;)

This was  great!  Even though I consider myself a good cook, I, too, always keep a few cans of soup (cream of celery, chicken) on hand for just this kinda thing, to whip something up, especially leftovers, in a hurry, throw it in the oven and forget about it.  Great way to use leftover potatoes, carrots, just about anything.  The only thing I changed was to add a lot more seasoning cuz I luv it!

A lovely, easy recipe. I followed reviewers advice and used two cans of soup (cream of chicken and cream of mushroom) and added 1/2 cup or so of milk. I used canned, cooked chicken that I rinsed, per another reviewer. This was just a delicious, hot meal that was simple to make. Serve with a side salad for a complete dinner.

This pot pie was delicious. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and made the following modificatons with excellent results: 2 cans soup, 1/2 cup milk, one cooked potato, 1/2 onion, pepper, garlic powder, and celery salt. I did use frozen mixed vegetables because that's all I had.  I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

Very good!  I decided to follow some of the suggestions provided by other users.  I used two cans (cream of chicken and cream of celery) and a half a cup of milk.  Also, I used fresh veggies- sauteed them first- and used rotisserie chicken.  This was more work than the recipe called for, but I really don't like canned veggies and the i figured the chicken would be moist.  It really turned out great!  My boyfriend had 2nds and 3rds.

I give this recipe three stars because it's not bad...but as-is...it's kind of bland.  One of my biggest pet peeves with this site is that people will give a recipe 5 stars...after extensively re-vamping the recipe in question.

At that point...you're not reviewing the recipe.  You're reviewing your revisions to the recipe.

So...as-is...this recipe is a reasonable starting point for a quick, homemade meal that will satisfy most people.  I made it again with my own revisions as well.  I added a second can of soup, loads of black pepper, 2 tbsp of onion powder and two cloves of fresh minced garlic.  However...I will not rate my own revisions as they are not part of the original recipe.  I stand by the three stars...and my advice that this is a decent starting point for you to add your own tastes.

This was a SUPER easy recipe!!!  I really enjoyed it and my husband LOVED IT!  I followed other's advice and added two cans of soup.  I cannot imagine it with less soup.  Also, I added lots of additional seasonings - garlic salt, black pepper, seasoning salt and cayenne pepper.  Lastly, I used a deep dish pie crust.  Again, great recipe!!!

This is a great starter recipe. I did tweak it a bit. I mixed one can of cream of mushroom soup, and one can of cream of chicken soup, both low sodium. I added frozen peas and carrots, and a can of mushrooms. For the topping I crushed about 25 Ritz crackers and mixed them with melted butter. Delicious!! My family devoured it.

This is very good.  I followed other suggestions to add both cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup.  I used just one small bag of frozen vegetables and it was still overstuffed!  I also used frozen pie crusts in the tins and just overturned one onto the filled pie crust and pinched the sides together and peeled off the top pie tin.

Quick, easy and good...even my toddler ate it up.  I changed the recipe to suit my family's preferences.  I pre cooked frozen corn, carrots and green beans instead of canned veggies.  Used 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup and 1 can of Cream of Potato soup. Added salt, pepper, a little garlic powder and a bit of poultry seasoning.  Great comfort food - will definitely make again!

This was VERY easy to make!!! I used a precooked  seasoned rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. This definitely needed more soup so I added two cans plus a bit of non fat half and half that i had in the fridge. I was out of cream of chicken soup, instead I used two cans of cream of celery. It was very good. The soup added some new and different flavors to the pie that my family really enjoyed!  Also used frozen mixed veggies. I cooked them first to soften them up. This is definitely a keeper!

This was my first attempt ever at chicken pot pie and my boyfried requests it every week.  I only used 3 chicken breasts and added another can of veggies, and also stir-fried the diced chicken in a lot of seasonings (garlic, onion powder, basil, poultry seasoning, vegetable seasoning, and a dash of Montreal Steak Spice).  It turned out fantastic.

Very good flavor.Used 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of celery soup.  In the end seems we could have had a wee bit more moisture.  Found 2 chicken breasts adequate.  Don't think we could have stuffed 4 breasts into the pie pan. Used Mrs. Smith deep dish crusts.

This was good but I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and ended up using one can of cream of chicken soup and one cream of mushroom.  One can of soup didn't seem like it would be enough.  I also made two pies.  They came out really good.

This is the greatest and easiest chicken pot pie recipe. After reading other recipes, I sometimes add fresh celery or potatoes or use a different condensed soup like cream of chicken and mushroom. Also, I usually add 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese to the mixture -- its the icing on the cake!!

Tasted great, and everyone loved it!!!  It was really easy to make.  I used frozen vegetables, and added a little more soup.  It ended up making two pies.  They are also great to freeze and save for later!

This recipe is very basic and we considered it somewhat bland until....I made it again with some very simple changes and the outcome was unbelievable! I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of chicken WITH HERBS, 1 bag of frozen fresh veggies, fresh ground pepper to taste, and shredded roaster chicken. The cream of chicken with herbs is the secret ingredient that makes this pot pie a favorite with my kids and all their friends. You can add all your own favorite herbs, but when pressed for time in a busy family, I say go easy with the herbed chicken. Use a good quality pie dough as well.  I think the original recipe is closer to 3 stars but the final one is definitely 5 stars.

Made this for dinner and the kids (my daughter and son-in-law) really liked it. I found it a bit dry, so next time I will probably use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. Thanks for sharing.

I make this all the time when I have leftover chicken. It is a bit bland as submitted so to flavor it I add a 1/2 tsp or so of Italian seasoning.  If I make it with fresh chicken I cut the chicken up into "fingers", rub in some seasoning and saute in just a bit of oil then cut into bite size chunks and proceed with the pot pie recipe.  Another reviewer added 1/2 C. milk and so do I.
If using leftover chicken and you only have the equivalent of 2 breasts, make in an 8 inch pie plate.

This is such an easy recipe but I found that you need to add spices. I used a combination of chili powder, cajun spice, adobo,paprika and Worsterchire sauce. Add this when you are cooking the chicken.

Yum...tasted great and came together quickly!  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil with onion and garlic.  I seasoned with salt and pepper and italian seasonings.  I used frozen mixed veggies, 1 can of cream of chicken and half a can of milk.  Poured it all into a pie crust and baked until golden.  Will make again.  My only problem was scooping it out...it got a little ugly but still tasted fantastic!

Excellent and easy... my favorite type of recipe!  I add 1/4 c. milk, 1/3 c. sour cream, and a lot more spices (whatever your fancy) and it turns out excellent every time.  I boil my chicken breasts in chicken broth before cubing (adds flavor to the chicken).  I use frozen mixed vegetables - just run hot water over them in a collander for a minute or two and they're ready to go.  Super fast to make, very tasty dish!

Believe it or not this was the first time I ever ate or made chicken pot pie.  This recipe was easy enough for a novice cook like me to succeed with flying colors.  I boiled my chicken in chicken stock, used chicken with herbs condensed soup, and a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  My 2 picky children ate 2 helpings and asked for this recipe to become a regular menu item.  I loved it.  It was simple, flavorful, and affordable.  Wonderful.

WOW!! I used 1 cup diced rotisserie chicken, 1 can of cream-of-chicken soup, 1 bag (16 oz) of frozen mixed veggies, 1/4 cup buttermilk, and 2 refrigerated pie crust. The result was a perfect and delicious 8X8 pie. Thank you for the recipe!!!

This is a good "basic" recipe. I added salt and pepper (alot of each). I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and we still thought it was a little dry so next time I might add a little milk or chicken broth. I also used a can each of green beans, carrots, and corn. No offense but i don't like using the can that has them all mixed together I think it is lacking. I also used the idea of another reviewer and used basil - that was a great idea. But this was my first chicken pot pie to ever make so I was very impressed.

This is such an easy recipe. I did follow other suggestions. I use 2 cans of soup, one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. I also use the veggies that my family will eat, not the mixed veggies. I highly recommend adding garlic, basil, parsley, paprika, minced onions. Use a prepackaged pie crust, and you're done. It's wonderfully easy.

We liked this alot. I used refrigerated pie crust and baked the bottom crust about 5 minutes before adding the filling.    I used the frozen mixed veggies and pre-cooked them before adding them to the mixture. I also added about 2 T milk for the texture I liked best plus seasoned to our liking! Very good basic pot pie recipe!

This pot pie definitely impressed my family. I did a couple variations to the recipe. I split this recipe in half, and made enough for 4 people (which it could have fed 5-6). First, I used 2 packages of pre-cooked diced chicken, which equaled around 2 breasts. I used only one can of soup. For the crust, I used 2 frozen deep dish. One for the bottom, the other for the top, which I had to cut to fit. I also used 1/2 bag of frozen veggies (which was around 15 ounces). For the spice, I used a bit of oregeno and basil. I liked this recipe because it is plain, so you I was able to add my own variations. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I used the basic ingredients but used cream of chicken & mushroom soup and doubled the amount...then added some herbs (montreal steak seasoning, poultry seasoning, pepper, garlic and onion salt, ground thyme, parsley, oregeno, & basil... thought I'd venture out a bit...and turned out GREAT!!! I also used frozen veggies which i find fresher than the can  and just shredded the chicken.  Boyfriend loves this one and even claims that it surpasses his own moms recipe!!

Deliciously amazing! I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup as well. I also used pre-cooked diced chicken because I was in a rush (it's in the lunch meat aisle) and for flavor, I seasoned the chicken with Original Mrs. Dash, basil, and some cajun seasoning. It was awesome--even the next day.

I added 1 can cream of celery soup and used frozen vegatables. It was the best chicken pot pie I had made. I also used left over chicken and that was a great time save. I will definately make again.

This was a very easy recipe. I used fresh veggies and just cooked them a little before hand. For a pie crust I used the "Easy Pie Crust" from this site. I used cream of chicken soup, but I also made an extra sauce on the side to put in the pie, and I still found that it was a little dry. It was still good though and I will be making this again.

very good and very easy.  I made my own "sauce" instead of using the canned cream of chicken.  (butter, flour, chicken broth and a touch of heavy cream)  It turned out wonderful and very flavorful.  This was a hit with the whole family.  Thanks!

Wonderful Recipe!  I did what another review suggested and added about 1/2 cup of milk.  I have found that it is just as good to cook the night before and reheat- Makes a great, healthy, quick meal!!!!!!

My first attempt at chicken pot pie, and it turned out great.  I took advice from other reviews and added the following: 10.75 oz can cream of celery soup, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp sage, and 1/3 cup cheddar cheese.  I also used a ready made pie crust.  This was a super easy recipe to make.  It turned out wonderful!

This is delicious!  It was the first pot pie I've ever made and tastes very homemade but it was quick and easy!  I used McCormick 1-step garlic herb chicken seasoning for extra flavor and made the pie in a glass casserole dish.  It initially looked like there wouldn't be enough "gravy" with just one can of cream of chicken but it was perfect!!

Great, easy recipe!  I added diced potatoes and used frozen mixed veggies (peas, carrots, corn, string beans, lima beans) instead of canned and it came out great.  Also used this recipe for leftover Thanksgiving Turkey.  Added a little leftover turkey gravy to the mix too.

This recipe was really only good as a base or idea, the first time I made it, it was very bland. I made many adjustments the second time. I chopped some mushrooms, broccoli, celery, carrot, and a sweet onion. I sauteed the onion and celery with some garlic and then put them to the side. In the same pan I sauteed the onion in I cooked the chicken (which I had diced into small pieces) with some paprika and pepper until golden brown. I added two cups water(because I like lots of gravy in my pot pie) to the soup and some chicken base. I added a can of corn (I usually use frozen but we didn't have any) and mixed everything together in a big bowl. I added a little bit more pepper and some parsley (no salt because the chicken base is usually salty). I also made homemade pie crust. I had lots of extra filling which I used for soup the next day. Very good with some improvements!

This is the greatest! Made it first as printed, then as others, started tweaking it to our tastes.
Used 2 cups precooked chicken chunks, sauteed 1 lg. onion, 1 rib celery and 8oz. fresh mushrooms in 2T. butter till tender. Added 12 oz. steam in bag mixed veggies (steamed) 1/8 cup white wine, 1 can cr. of chicken soup, 1/2 can milk, cajun seasonings, and 4 oz. shredded sharp cheddar. This filled my very deep dish pie dish.
Used Pillsbury refrig. crusts (no pre baking) Put it on a cookie sheet and baked @400*F for approx. 30-40 min till well browned. Scrumptious!!
This has been a great company dish for me - always raves!
Also making it right now for us - hubby loves it!

Made this and even my wife liked it!  I did think it was a bit bland and a bit dry as per recipe.  I am going to make it again today and add more soup and some spices.  You can't beat it for quick, easy and hardy!  And as for using a pre-made pie crust and canned veggies...afterall, it's supposed to be quick and easy. If you have the time........go ahead and make your own crust and cut up fresh veggies.  But with a bit of seasoning to taste it is hard to beat this!

Thank you so much for the great recipe! After reading some of the reviews I used frozen veggies instead of canned.  Plus I sautéed and onion, some garlic, and fresh sliced mushrooms and added.  This was so easy, the leftovers were great!  Will definitely make again.

This is a family favorite. It can be made with bisquits instead of pie creat (GREAT)a couple of things Nature's seasoning added to a bag of frozen mix veggies (instead of can), two small cooked potatoes (finley diced) and one can of cream of mushroom or cream of chicken. Great!!! SN: lightly brown the pie crust or biscuits prior to adding items otherwise it will be soggy. Enjoy!

Very bland flavor.  For the unadventerous eater.  Have to say, if you're not used to eating canned veggies or just prefer FRESH, this recipe will not do it for you. Using frozen pie crust or a boxed mix (Krusteaz is good) and pre-cooked chicken would save even more time.  All in all, not bad and not good ... but I'm sure there are plenty of folks who will like it.

This is the recipe I have always used except I use thawed frozen mixed vegetables and I make my crust from scratch.  It does taste a little bland without some added seasoning so I sometimes add a little minced garlic. My family always enjoys it.  When all 3 of my kids were still at home we never had leftovers!

I have a variation on this simple recipe (which I have, but just changed it up a bit) I use cream of potato soup instead of chicken. I use frozen veggies instead of canned... that way i can also add veggies not included in 'the mix' ... I also add a good scoop of Herbs de Provence (DELISH!) ... pie shell on top and bottom. It is a heavy dish but GREAT in the winter and to share ......

This was great comfort food!  Used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, couple of shakes of lawrey's seasoned salt, and some pepper.  Made my own crust using "Easy to remember pie crust" from this site.  Wonderful dinner.

I make this with fresh diced carrots, celery, potatoes and green pepper for added flavor.  You can also add a small can of mixed veg.  Pour cream of chicken soup or gravy on top, salt & pepper to taste.  Add top pie crust and bake for about 45 minutes to an hour or until golden brown

Sometimes, all you want is an easy, tasty, healthy dish.  This one certainly qualifies.  I used frozen veggies from our garden, low fat soup, added some ranch dressing mix (for the seasoning).  Served with a green salad and a fruit cup, this was a great entree for dinner before Christmas Eve church and family activities.

Yummy, quick, and easy to make!  This busy mom of 4 approves!  I used boneless chicken thighs for a less expensive chicken alternative, I am going to try canned chicken breast next time.  I used frozen veggies instead of canned, because I like the fresher veggie taste, and it was actually a bit cheaper to go frozen.  I used 1/2 of a 16 oz bag of frozen veggies and I cooked the chicken pieces in a skillet with salt and pepper.  I put tin foil around the edges of the pie to prevent burning.  It was a hit in our house!

This came out pretty good. I made a few modifications.  Because I only boil chicken for my dogs, I seasoned 6 frozen chicken breast tenderloins and baked them for 20 minutes in my toaster oven.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  I used two deep dish pie crusts. I also used frozen vegetables and microwaved them for 3 minutes to get them tender.  Because I love mushmooms, I added sliced baby bellas.  I seasoned the filling with pepper,majoram, and a little basil.  It was very tasty.  The next time, I will probably use low sodium soups because it was a little too salty and I didn't add salt.

This is a great base recipe for nights when you really don't have a lot of time.  I threw the chicken breasts on the george foreman grill while I cooked up some potatoes (I microwaved them, then skinned them).  While I was dicing the chicken and potatoes I steamed a bag of frozen veggies.  I also diced an onion to add to the vegetable mix.  I tossed all of the chicken and vegetables into a large bowl and added 2 cans of condensed chicken soup (after adding one it was clear that it wouldn't be enough) and topped it off with some milk (I didn't bother measuring).  The consistency was great, although I had an excess of filling (my fault for adding so many excess vegetables).  Next time I'll likely opt for a deep dish pie.    Like I said, its a great base recipe, but some personal-preference tailoring is definitely required for it to be a great pot pie.

This recipe is EASY and GOOD!  I have read some of the other reviews saying its bland, but I always add salt and pepper to any recipe!   The first time I made this:  I used the pillsbury pie crust(2 per box) and I used canned chicken cubes.  I drained and rinsed the chicken.  I used frozen veggies as well.  Layed the pie crust on the bottem mixed the soup, veggies, chicken, salt and pepper in a bowl then added it.  Baked it for 45 min and it turned out PERFECT!!!    Im making the same recipe tonight with the exception of using frozen chicken breast that I boiled and everything else is the same.   My family LOVED it!  My husband had 2 servings and my 8 year old and 18 month old cleaned their plates(Veggies and all!!)  I will make this recipe SEVERAL times over!

I liked this recipe because it is super fast and easy and has room for adjusments.  I used Pillsbury ready pie crusts and one can cream of mushroom soup one can cream of chicken.  I used frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, corn and greenbeans) and also peeled and diced up a medium russet potato.  Finally I added some garlic powder, pepper and a handful of fresh herbs (thyme, oregano, parsley and sage) finely minced and it was really good.  I can see using any number of leftovers for this dish as well.  Though not gormet, the ease, speed and overall taste is really good.

This recipe was great! Fast and easy. I also like it because you can adjust it to suit your taste. As suggested I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, and added a few dashes of garlic powder to the mix and some black pepper. I also used a stew frozen vegetable mix that had carrots, potatoes, celery, and pearl onions. This made a yummy hearty potpie, perfect for cold winter evenings :)!

Perfect for a cold, rainy day!  I took other reviewers advice and added 1 can of cream of celery soup.  I also added minced garlic, black pepper, and minced onion.  Turned out wonderful, my whole family loved it and said they'd never eat frozen pot pie again!  Good for me this is an easy recipe!

Very good recipe.  I covered the whole thing with aluminum foil for 45 minutes then uncovered and baked additional 10-15 minutes.  The crust was so good and flaky.

The best thing about this recipe is the ability to alter it.  I used 2 1/2 large breast, 1/2 large bag frozen mixed veggies, about 1/4 cup of yellow onion, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken.  The recipe needed more flavor for my family so I added salt, pepper, a few dashes of chili powder and McCormick Garlic and Herb Seasoning.  I also used two Pillsbury Pie Crust rather then making my own.  It turned out fabulous.  My family devoured it and it will be made again.

I thought this was great -- i used a store crust (which was fine) and added 2 tbl of sour cream and sprinkled with parm. cheese before adding the top layer.  It was great and easy

Very filling and a lot easier than I thought.  I boiled the chicken in a pan using Chicken broth until cooked then using the same broth I added mixed baby vegetables including pea pods, peas, carrots, and those baby corn cobs.  I also added some mrs. dash to the vegetables and just some salt and pepper and a pinch of salt.  I also added one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of celery.  My family loved it.  Perfect cold winter night meal.  Oh and by the generic ready made crust. Same ingredients and half the price.  I brushed the top of the pastry with egg whites before using.

I used a store bought pie crust on this recipe as well as the called for canned vegetables.  Perhaps that is why my results were less than desirable.  If I were to make again I would use fresh or frozen veggies and a homemade pie crust.  However, I doubt I will use this again because there just seemed to be some flavor missing.  Also, I felt that the crust to filling ratio was off. Too much filling - the crust is the best part!  Still, I am sure a better cook than I could make a great meal out of this, but as written I didn't think it lived up to expectations.

This recipe was a little dry.  I might recommend adding an extra can of soup, I used cream of cheddar.  Otherwise, this recipe was so easy and great tasting.  This will be on our menu again.

This was great. I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables that I cut up to make smaller for picky eaters. I used a can of cream of chicken soup, a can of mushroom soup with garlic and a can of cheddar cheese soup. I also added different kinds of cheeses. I spiced it up with Spike, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and a little fresh ground salt and pepper. 
It was great!
I also made this once with beef (I was out of chicken) and added a package of cream of onion soup mix, golden mushroom soup, a dash of worcestershire sauce and beef broth, keeping everything else the same. 
This recipe is very easy to adapt. I may make it with ham soon. 
Pot pies are so popular in my house and this is the best recipe for any of them.

I reduced this recipe for just me and my husband: 2 boneless skinless chicken breast, one can of low-fat cream of chicken soup, a little more than a half cup of milk, 3/4 bag of frozen vegetables and two frozen pie crusts. First I sauted sliced onion and fresh minced garlic with salt for a few minutes until soft. Added the frozen vegetables until warm and then stirred in soup and milk. Added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a kick, and lots of salt and pepper. Poured all into rolled out pie crust and pinched top crust on. Sprayed the top with butter-flavored cooking spray so it browns up. Baked almost an hour. Turned out great!! My picky husband ate it up and we didn't have any leftovers. Would definitely make again with my changes.

I made two slight changes to the recipe, and the result was described by my roommate as "better than Marie Callender's."  I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts (four seemed too much for the shell and just one can of soup), and instead of canned vegetables (so little flavor), I used frozen mixed vegetables.  I stirred the frozen veggies in with the soup and cooked chicken, covered with other crust, generously seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked as directed.  The result was as delicious as the dish was simple to make.  A definite keeper and regular star in my kitchen.

Boyfriend said it was the best pot pie he's ever had. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and did a mix of vegetables. 1/2 can of green beens and 1/2 can of cream of corn with 1/2 a bag of baby carrots and 1/2 container of mushrooms, 2 redskin potatoes along with some onion and one clove garlic. I also added salt, pepper, mrs. dash, parsley and oregano.

I added 1 diced potato and 2 stalks of diced celery to the chicken just before it was done. I only used one can of the cream of chicken soup and about 1/8 cup of milk. My whole family thought it was better than the frozen stuff!

Yum!  I didn't have any canned vegetables (don't care for them) so I diced one potato, chopped up a handful of baby carrots and threw in a handful of frozen peas and cooked them for about 15 minutes before adding them to the chicken and soup.  It was delicious!  Next time I will add an additional can of soup because I would have liked a little more gravy, but the flavor was terrific as is!

This was an excellent and EASY recipe to make.  I used only two chicken breasts.  1 box of Jiffy Pie Crust.  1 can cream chicken 1/4 can cream mushroom.  1 can of Vegall plus added frozen peas.  A few tablespoons of milk.  It was delicious.  It sliced just like a pie and did not fall apart.  Even better the next day!

My 9 year old son selected this recipe to make himself for dinner.  We used canned chunk chicken and steamed fresh veggies (carrots, broccoli, green beans) and added frozen corn and peas.  We also used a ready made refidgerated pie crust.  This was a very easy recipe, and much tasties than I expected.  I also added garlic powder and sage to the mixture.  Yum!

My family loved this recipe! I used canned chunk chicken from my local warehouse club, and used my quick homemade pie crust. Thank goodness I decided to make two because they both went quick!

As a student I like making easy things (15 minutes to cook and eat!) but I had a sunday
free to avoid revising so I made one of these pies. it was really nice. I chopped up 2 chicken legs and a small pack of chicken breast fillets for the meat, which I boiled, then I put it all in a bowl with the soup and added a large amount of vegetables - anything I could find - satueed onions and carrots, some broccoli (if you like your broccoli well cooked, boil or steam it first, but if like me you like it almost raw just wash it and chuck it in). Then I put in some frozen mixed veg as well. I freaked out and added some chicken stock (about a cup) to the mixture, which made it a little runny but i think pies are nicer that way. I didn't have a pie dish so I just put it in a casserole dish. I used a basic shortcrust pastry but instead of plain flour, I use self-raising as it gives a lighter pastry.

This recipe was wonderfully easy, which is why I chose it.  I would thin the cream of chicken soup just a little the next time I fix it.

This pie was pretty good..but a little bland. Need some more spice, which you could add at your own liking.
It was fast and easy.

I had to spice this recipe up a lot for flavor, but it ended up very nice.  My husband was spoiled by his mom's down-home cooking all his life, but he really raved about this.

This recipe is simple and great.  I also used pre made deep dish crusts.  Also, if you add jsut a dash of thyme is adds a little zing!!  Just be sure not to use more than a dash, thyme can be overwhelming.

This may seem like the recipe is too easy to be good, but it's great!
I was sick the other day and was surfing the net, my husband came home 
and said, "what's for dinner".  Well you know how that story goes, take 
out baby!, but I ran across this recipe and thought even my husband 
could make it. He hates take-out!   It was so quick and easy, and then 
the BONUS... my 9 year old son loved it, my husband loved it and my mom
loved it!  Quick, easy... and a happy family while mom can recuperate.
Thanks!.. I am excited to try your other recipes!!

This couldn't be any easier!! And so
good!! I boiled my chicken with some seasoning to give it flavor and added canned diced potatoes to the frozen mixed vegetables I used, and it came out perfect! Picky five-year-old ate it right up!!!

Family loved. Few changes...seasoned chicken...used veggies (canned) I like. But isn't that what your supposed to do.... "Season to taste"?
Anyway, preparing dinner was a breeze and there were no leftovers to put away.
In my house, that's when I know I have a winner. Thanks!

Great base for a recipe. I used 2 cans Amy's Cream of Mushroom & 2 cans Cream of Chicken. Frozen peas, corn, pearl onions & fresh carrots, sweet potato (cut up small). Spiced with salt, pepper & thyme. Made 2 pies + a personal pie.

I changed a few things ... used two cans of soup ... cream of chicken and cream of celery ... added lots of spices.  Sautéed onions and mushrooms in butter ... added to mixture ... it turned out GREAT except for one thing???  I used Pillsbury pie crusts ... they were too small and too sweet.  I will definitely make this again but I will use a different crust.  My husband loved the filling but refused to eat the crust.  He thought that it was overly sweet and so did I.  Without the additions, I feel that it would not have been too bland.

Awesome. I subbed out a rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breasts, used canned fiesta corn, canned peas and carrots, and a small can of mushrooms. Added in some Mrs. Dash Southwestern spice. Great!!

It's a good thing this is easy because I have to make it all the time now.  I've learned to make double when I make it.  I cook the chicken in the crockpot and when really pressed for time, I buy refrigerated pie crust.  This is a great basic recipe that can be modified to your family's taste.  I added milk for the first time today because another reviewer suggested it so we'll see.  I also like that I also like that I can control the fat content compared to the store bought pot pies.

Excellent shell of a recipe! However it was rather bland. I would suggest adding your favorite seasonings to the mixture before putting it in the pie crust. Simple recipe and a great spin on a weeknight meal! I will keep it in my recipe book forever (just with a few tweaks)!

I made this for an easy Halloween night dinner. I half baked the bottom crust before adding the mixture.  I should have baked it longer as it was still doughy.  Also to save time I used a can of chicken.  Overall this was easy and pretty good.

It doesn't get any easier than this. I usually add italian seasoning and black pepper to the chicken while it's cooking. To dilute the cream of chicken a little, I add chicken stock. Um ummm.

Have a similar recipe that calls for 1 can chicken breast, and one ea. of cream of chicken, mushroom & celery soup, along with the canned veggies.  I add 1/3-1/2 can of diced water chestnuts which gives it a little crunch...my wife agrees that it is works.  Seven cans and a top crust, couldn't be much easier.

I like the recipe only because it's a very simple recipe to add things to. I'll have to type up my own version.

Very delicious basic pot pie w/ lots of possibilities for mixing it up. I would probably try to use low-fat cream soup next time, and also would look for a lower cal crust. Good family meal!

I made this using two deep dish pie crusts to make one BIG pot pie.  My family loved it, but it hadn't thawed out after 24 hours out of the freezer, and took forver to cook.  Next time I will still use two deep dish crusts, but make it into 2 separate pot pies.

This was fantastic! This is the second time that I have made it and it was even better this time. I only used 1 can of soup and added a bit of half and half. I also added sauted onions and garlic and garlic and onion power, herbs de provonce and a little parmesan cheese and wow....it was amazing. This is definitely my new and simple pot pie recipe. Thank you!

This was insanely simple to do. My husband said it was perfect and gave this 10 stars. The Hungry Teen had seconds. I thought it was rather bland and needed more seasoning. I did use 2 cans of soup 1 cream of celery and 1 cream of chicken with herbs. Instead of two cans of veggies I used 1 large can of large cut mixed veggies. So easy this is one I'll give to the kids as they move out it's a great starter recipe.

My hubby loves, loves, loves this pot pie...he is extremely picky so this is where I sneak some "unidentified" veggies in and he never even notices.  He asks for this for dinner at least once a week.  This is a good one!

Very tasty and easy.  My alterations based on reading all the reviews: Used a top crust only, 2 15 oz. cans of Veg All, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of celery, 2-4 oz. cans mushrooms, and seasoned with savory, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cayenne, Tabasco, seasoned salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.  We really enjoyed it!

Since discovering this recipe myself and my family have enjoyed it at least 10 times.  It's easy and the last bit is usually fought over.  I use refrigerated pie dough and cook the bottom before I put the pie together.  That way the crust is nice and crispy.  I have also added potatoes to the mix (hashbrown potatoes).  Yum!

This had way to much filling. Not enough cream. It took longer than 45 min. to get brown. My husband only took 1 bite and did not want anymore. My 10 year old daughter ate hers but I think she did not want to hurt my feelings. What a sweet kid I have.

I added twice the vegetables carrots, peas, corn and broccoli about one cup each and then two cans of cream of mushroom soup. I used the flaky pie crust, and added pepper, salt, onion flakes, oregano, garlic and basil to taste or approximatly a tblsp of everything except for the salt. I added 1 tsp of salt. It was delicious a family favorite and easy to make.

Can't get much better - or easier - than this!  I used cut up rotisserie chicken to make it even easier (if that's possible!), and added a few extra seasonings (poultry seasoning, Lowry's seasoned salt) to the mixture.  My family loved it - will definitely make this again!

Really really good! Such an easy recipe and it tastes great! My only recommendation is to cook the bottom crust a bit before putting the filling in, the last 2 times I've made this, the top was perfect and golden brown but the bottom wasn't fully cooked.

This is a wonderful recipe because it is simple, basic, and quick. Plus if you want a little bit more "fancier" pot pie you can easily doctor it up. 

Like others I used to cans of soup and a 1/2 cup of milk. In the the milk I added a chicken bouillon cube for flavor. I also sauteed a half a onion and a couple stalks of celery and added them to my other veggies. Oh I also used frozen veggies because that is  what I had on hand. I also added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley to the chicken when I cooked it. Finally I served my pot pie with biscuits. It was a great touch. 

Very Yummy. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This was a good base recipe.  I needed the idea to do it "my" way... I used frozen mixed veggies (I microwaved them a bit first, but not all the way), some fresh spinach that I quickly steamed first, and added a scoop of sour cream.  I also put in some flavor from dry minced onion, garlic powder, parsely, and thyme.  I also used refrigerated pie crust dough from the grocery store for less work.  Anyway, as my husband said, I used less chicken and loaded all the veggies I could inside like normal, and it was yummy!  We'll definitely make this again, and look forward to trying it different ways.

Great crowd pleaser for hubby and little kids. The kids were convinced they were going to hate it, but gobbled it up.  Used pillsbury crecent rolls for crust (two pkgs).  Cooked chicken in some garlic and herb seasoning, and used cream of chicken and garlic soup.  Added veggies I had on hand, and wasn't bland at all.

This was the first time I'd ever made Chicken Pot Pie!  I used chopped rotisserie chicken from the local grocer.  A whole chicken did the trick.  I also had those Pillsbury refrigerated rolled pie crusts.  I had frozen corn and peas but not any carrots.  I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and half a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Salt and Pepper and Thyme too, and it's pretty darn good!  I'll make this again!

This is a keeper and our new comfort food recipe Sunday dish. 
Like most I add just a little thyme (adds so much to the pot pie). Seasoning the chicken adds tons of flavor too. Try Grill Mates montreal chicken or Mrs. Dash.
And I use 1 bag of California blend frozen veggies, thawed. 
Sometimes 1 can, sometimes 2 of cream chicken soup. I bet cream/celery would be good! 
Love how easy and delicious this is! Makes me feel like Mrs. Betty Crocker!

This is a good basic recipe and I've made it several times.  I changed this recipe a little.  I used frozen veggies instead of canned.  I usually add carrots, peas, corn, and onion.  I also used 2 cans of soup-usually cream of chicken and cream of potato.  I also use the Pillsbury roll out crust and I only put it on top.  I don't use a crust on the bottom.  I usually brush the top of the crust with a little egg to give it a nice color. It is a little bland if you don't add any herbs-I accidentally left them out one time.  You can add whatever you like and have on hand.

This is a very easy dish to make. (My 2nd dinner to cook ever). It tastes good but I had to add quite a bit of salt to the end product. My boyfriend liked it but I thought it was rather bland.

Yum, yum, yum. I made this but with a few adjustments suggested by others plus some of my own. Instead of the canned veggies I used pearl onions and fresh mushrooms. I also added 1/3 cup milk, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I will definately make again.

This is wonderful! I've made this several times and love it. I usually use 1 can of mixed veggies and 1 can of diced potatoes. I have also mixed up the meat... I've used chicken (with cream of chicken soup) and I've used ground turkey (with cream of mushroom soup). I also add about 3/4 cup of milk. Both variations I have tried are wonderful!!

This pie was so easy to make and was better than I expected to be. It took a lot longer to bake than to prepare. I would suggest less oven time.

I pretty much follow this recipe, only instead of using the pie crust, I mix together flour, eggs and milk and pour it over the mixture.  It bakes up really nice. I also cook the chicken on the stove and season with garlic, salt and pepper to give it a little flavor.  Its really good.  The canned veggies work much better than frozen, like many other recipes call for. This is a great, quick, super easy recipe to use for weeknight dinners.

I made this for dinner last night, with a few minor changes.  I used frozen veggies, a can of cream of chicken, and a can of cream of mushroom.  I also added some garlic salt, a pinch of herbes de provence, and poultry seasoning.  It gave it a great flavor, and my family loved it.  I will definitely make it again!

This was a very good, simple recipe that was a hit with the family. The only alterations I made were- I used cooked frozen mixed veggies and one can of diced new potatoes. I also added a dash of onion powder and thyme. Yummy and very easy!

I've never made a pot pie & this was so easy!  I did add 1 tsp of basil, 1 1/2 cans cream of chicken soup & a little salt & pepper.  I cooked a bag of frozen vegetables for my pie and baked bottom crust (store bought Pilsbury refrigerated) for 5 mins before putting in the filling as someone else suggested.  My husband & MIL loved it and I will make this again for sure!

I made changes, but for someone who has had maybe one (if that) chicken pot pie in a lifetime, this recipe was a great base! I used frozen veggies and double the sauce like so many others.
I also cooked the chicken stovetop with seasoning and added chopped mushroom and cubed up some potatoes. I added garlic salt and some Mrs Dash to the mix and that was all it needed. I cooked everything almost an hour and also sprayed some butter (I can't believe it's not butter) over the top for the last 5 minutes, and placed a few teaspoons of fat free sour cream over it when it came out (made a prettier presentation). IT WAS AMAZING!

It turned out wonderful! I'm so glad that I tried it. Like a lot of people, I too altered it a tad bit. I seasoned the chicken with Season salt and Lemon Pepper, then I cooked it in the pan in a little olive oil until it was browned on both sides but still raw in the middle. When both sides were browned I filled the pan halfway with chicken broth and let it simmer (covered)until it was done. When it was done I let it rest while I prepared the veggies. I used frozen peas and a mixed veggies with corn, carrots, and asparagus. I put the veggies in the left over chicken broth to cook halfway through. Then I mixed everything together (2 cans of the soup, 2 TBS milk, 2 TBS of the left over broth from the veggies/chicken)

I've never made a chicken pot pie before and this turned out very good and was easy. I shredded my chicken and followed other suggestions and used 2 cans of cream of chicken and used one package of frozen mixed veggies (peas, carrots, and green beans) and added a little bit of milk. I also threw in some seasonings. I had to cook it longer than the 45 minutes but that's probably because I used frozen veggies instead of canned. I waited until the gravy was bubbling up out of the crust. My husband loved it!

This recipe was delish!! There weren't any leftovers. This was the first pot pie recipe I've ever tried, and it was just what I was looking for! I added a little salt and pepper, dried thyme, and some cubed potatos to the filling.

I LOVE this recipe, but I have tweaked it a bit to make it a Vegetarian Chicken Pot Pie! I use the Morningstar Farms chicken strips instead of chicken. I warm those in a pan, then cut them into small bite-size pieces. I use 2 frozen pie crusts (using 1 for the bottom and the other for the top, after it has thawed a bit). I mix up a can of mixed veggies, a can of cream of mushroom soup, about 1/2 cup of soymilk, then add salt, pepper, parsley, and a little garlic salt. Add the fake chicken, put it into the pie crust, and bake. It's so easy.

This was pretty darn good however I changed up the orignally recipe a little bit. My husband and I aren't big veggie eaters so I only added 1 can of Mixed Veggies. I also added an extra can of cream of chicken soup. And I added a can of potato soup. I enjoyed it! My husband gave it a 7.5 out of 10.

This was my first ever chicken pot pie and it was so easy and very very good. I my whole family loved it including my 2yr old and my 10mth old. I did not use canned veg. I instead used the frozen mixed veg. I also put mesquite seasoning for chicken on the chicken before I cooked it. I cooked chunkes of potatos and put them in the mix. I then took the advice from another cook and used the pillsbury ready to use pie crust. I it was sooo... good. I will be making this again and again. Thanks to all.

This is a great comfort food recipe!  I didn't use as much chicken and added 1 can of mushroom soup.  I recommend using Mary Callender's frozen pie crust, its delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

I added a 1/2 can of celery soup and it still seemed to need more, next time I will add the whole can and I did put cubed potatoes. But it was ok, my husband said to tweak it a bit more, I think I will do that.

This was very easy (I used a frozen pie crust) and tasty. It tasted better the second day after flavors blended a little. 4/5 because of the lack of seasonings--they would make it much better.

This is very tasty if you moderate it a bit. I sauted the chicken with onions in olive oil. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, and frozen mixed veggies (I hate canned ones!) I also added cheddar cheese in it (b/c I Love cheese!)I have made this twice!!

I followed the recipe exactly and this was great! So simple! 
My husband and 3 kids want it once a week and they have such different tastes. Next time I won't crimp the top crust and the bottom crust at the edge. I'll just lay it on top. Thanks! :o)  Donna

A super-easy recipe. This is my tried and true recipe. I have the store-bought crust and have added one can of cream of celery to the ingredients. I also broil or stir-fry the chicken to speed up cooking time.

I used "Basic Flaky Pie Crust," available on this website.  This recipe has a LOT of potential.  Though very good "as is," as others have suggested, it clearly needs some spicing up.  I will read other reviewers suggestions on spices next time I make this.  Fresh or frozen veggies, though time consuming to prepare, would likely provide a lot more zip.  The pie crust was the best part, and with some spice tinkering, this could easily be a five-star recipe.

This was not only delicious, but so easy!  I bought the canned mixed veggies that had potatoes in it as well as peas, carrots, corn and green beans.  I also added some garlic salt, pepper and a little Thyme and my family devoured it!  Next time I will have to make two pies!

I made a low-fat version by using Campbell's low fat cream of chicken soup. I also followed some of the other suggestions and added some extras:  chopped onion, garlic, celery and potato lightly sauteed then added to frozen mixed veggies. My whole family enjoyed this great dish.  Great on a cold winter night.

I made this for my b/f who has been asking continuously for chicken pot pie. It was fast, easy and delicious. My only question is to the original receipe writer or those who have made it...Did you have to add more soup then the receipe calls for? I added two cans and it seems like it needed more, of course, it could be the fact that I threw in potatoes where the receipe didn't call for them. I suppose it's possible the potatoes soaked up the soup. But the end result...was fabulous. Thank you!

Super easy and delicious. I substituted lowfat condensed soup for a lighter taste- also added a cup of milk to the soup and some pepper. That made it less dry when re-heating. Wonderful recipe I will pass on to all my friends.

I was using rotisserie chicken, so chicken by the cup would be helpful, found a recommendation that 4 breast halves would be about 2 cups.  Also, needed seasoning, so will use onions or dried onion seasoning (Onion, Onion) next time.

I made two pot pies with this recipe.  One eaten the same day, the other 1 month later after freezing.  Both times very good and reminiscent of my mother's recipe when I was a kid.  Word to the wise: be sure to add water if the mix is too thick.  The consistency is important.

Awesome, down home recipe that you can customize according to your family's taste! Try adding a half tablespoon of the new Better Than Bullion (chicken) to the soup, veggie, chicken mixture before you put it into the pie crust!!

Very simple , very good, and on a cold winters day hits the spot. Only difference is that I used fresh/frozen vegetables instead of canned.  I just 1/2 cooked the carrots in boiling water for about 4 minutes,  the corn and peas were frozen, rinsed and drained, then chopped celery and finely chopped onion also.  Can't go wrong here.

Took other reviewer’s advice and used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, and a little milk. Used refrigerated pie crusts and a 2lb bag of frozen mixed veggies. Added S&P, garlic and onion powders, and thyme to taste. Only used 2 boiled chicken breasts. It’s was SO EASY and DELICIOUS.

Based on previous review that said it was bland, I added a few things. I sauted some chopped onion, green pepper and celery. We like things spicy so I also added 1/2 tsp. of Tony Chacere's and1/4 tsp. ground mustard. (I only had one pie crust so I froze 1/2 of the chicken/vegetable mixture) and folded the crust over the filling leaving an extra 1/2 inch hanging over one side of pie pan so I could crimp and seal it. I cut slits and basted crust with egg white wash (we like crust on the bottom and top). This was plenty for the three of us...and it was a hit.

I find it exceedingly annoying when people don't make the recipe as is, then give it a low review with a condescending comment. I do appreciate reviews that tell their tweaks, but don't go and say the original was bad. You didn't make the original. That said, I did make it as is, and the reason it only got 4 stars was because I like more sauce in my chicken pot pie. Next time I'll do two cans of soup and some milk as others have suggested.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe! I only made changes to accommodate the items I had on hand. I used 5 boneless, skinless chicken thighs and boiled them with a diced onion in chicken stock. Drained and shredded. Added all other ingredients along with some sage, rosemary, salt and pepper. My family loves this dish! 
I almost always adjust recipes to accommodate the ingredients I already have a long with flavors/herbs, but am sure the recipe would be great without any adjustments!
Thank you for posting!

Suggest running water over the frozen vegetables to quicken the thawing process so they will cook through in the 45 minutes represented on the recipe.  We had to cook the Pot Pie for over an hour to get the vegetables hot, then had to warm additionally in the microwave.  Easy recipe, great taste, just took us longer following the temp and time frame represented.

So easy, so good.   You can put it together in minutes.  Sent the husband to the store for a pie plate, grumbling all the way because he doesn't like pot pie.  He brought back a deep cake pan, so I gave it a try.  After it was done, I ate one serving and he ate all but one more portion, which he finished up the next day for lunch.  It was that good!

My family loves this recipe. It's the easiest chicken pot pie there is. The only issue is that it becomes dry when reheated, so be sure to add a little milk before placing it in the microwave.

I used this recipe a basis for using turkey leftovers. I used he Marie Callendar's pie crusts since they don't contain lard (our family doesn't eat pork)...Everything turned out great

I've made this several times and my husband loves it. If you use regular cream of chicken, you may want to add some flavor. I use Morton's "Nature Seasons".

Decided to make this for dinner tonight. I had to run to the store for a few things, while I was gone my husband and kids finished the whole pie half way through my quick errands. It was so good and full of flavor!

This was easy to make however it was a little bland for me and my family.  Made it a second time and added some fresh thyme, salt, pepper and marjoram.  This improved the taste for us and will make again.

It tasted great; thought it was a little heavy though (might have been exacerbated by the pie crust I made). I added about a half cup of milk and used only 1 can of vegetables since I ran out of room in the pie.

EASY PEASY - this is a quick chicken pot pie, it's a GREAT base.  The key here is how easy and fast for a fall night after working all day. Some ideas: used leftover or store bought whole chicken shredded. use biscuit mix and make cut out biscuits for the top, one pie shell for the bottom.  Season everything to YOUR tastes. You can use any creamy soup, mushroom, broccoli and cheddar, celery.  If you use a soup that isn't creamy add a tablespoon of flour. (when heating the soup with half water - stir well) or.. use a jar of gravy.  This is a great recipe and if you think about the tastes of you and your family you can make it your own. and you can do this with any protein, tuna! Beef! hamburger! lamb! any veggie.. use what you have on hand!

I have make this recipe several times, so I am giving a review after several tries. My only change to this recipe is precooking the chicken. I do it to err on the safe side of cooking safety. My second modification which is not really a modification is adding a bit of dried parsley,a pinch of salt and pepper, and a pinch of Goya Sazón with saffron. I particularly do not like white looking chicken so it adds a bit of flavor and color to it while pre-cooking the chicken. After precooking the chicken I follow the recipe as written. If you wish to change a the recipe a bit while adding virtually a bit of celery without having to chop celery, replace the condensed chicken soup for condensed celery soup. Yum as written,yum with my modifications and a bit less calories too with all the flavor!

I like this recipe, but I use 1 -  16 ounce bag of frozen mixed vegetables  and 1 box of the Pacific brand condensed soup and that seems to work very well.

I really like this recipe.  I use the Pillsbury refrigerated crusts; I've tried store brand but they seem drier and harder to manipulate.  I have found success using leftover turkey breast and discovered this recipe looking for something in which to use leftover holiday turkey. I like it better with turkey than with stewed chicken breasts. I use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables without potatoes...I find the "soup mix" veggies to have way too many potatoes and they taste weird. As suggested by someone else, I do boil the frozen vegetables with one bouillon cube until warm and then drain. I actually like to use one fresh potato cubed and boiled in the microwave, rinsed and added to the mix. It's just enough potato. Like many people here, I use two cans of soup.  I like to use Campbell's cream of chicken with herbs soup.  It adds a good amount of flavor without having to gauge how much marjoram or whatever else is needed to perk it up.  The soup provides enough sodium for my taste. I do not add milk. It makes good leftovers and reheats well in the microwave.

So good and fast! I followed the directions, but altered the measurements a bit and ended up with 2 very full pies. 
I used approx. 2 cups diced chicken, 1 cup each steamed broccoli and cauliflower, 1 cup each frozen corn and peas, 2 cans of soup, and 1 soup can full of milk. I had to bake it about 50 minutes to brown the crust. I may consider baking it at 400 next time in the hopes of cutting down on the baking time.

I love your recipe, as others have done I also tweaked it a little. I use organic frozen vegetables, and substitute milk with water, since the condensed soup is usually salty and already contains a creamy consistency. In addition, I season the chicken breast while they cook and let my husband chop the chicken in to fine shredded pieces, add just a pinch of pepper and garlic. Oh one important tip, I bake the bottom crust for 15 minutes before adding the sauce, this way the bottom does not taste like a dumpling, it's more flaky. 
Delicious. 
Thank you for sharing, this is now my go to Sunday meal.

I DID try it & it was good, but I agree w/ a previous comment that it was a bit bland...next time I think I'll spice up the mixture before putting it in the crust. Also I thought it was lacking in "gravy" so also maybe add another can of ckn. condensed soup. I followed someone else's suggestion by adding a splash of milk to the soup, & it was still not enough. So I'd try 1/2-a whole can more next time. Otherwise was a good economical meal!

This recipe rocks da' haus!

But the best part, for me, was the background guitar instrumental that accompanied the video!

I play lots of guitars, so I'm playing that more than I'm eating the pot pie. 

Actually, I'm a big fanboy for the KFC pot pies!

I have always wanted to try to make chicken pot pie and this was great. The only tweaking I did was I browned the chicken diced chicken and added one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of potato soup. I also diced 2 medium potatoes and added that to the mixture and simmered until the potatoes were soft. I then added thawed frozen corn, peas, carrots, and stringbeans to the mixture and let it simmer until the the veggies were warm. I used the Stop & Shop brand of ready to use pie crust and this mixture was enough for 2 pies with enough mixture left that I froze for a future pie. I'm going to try a shrimp version soon...I don't know when since my husband is allergic to shrimps..lol...this was a great recipe to start off with the basic tools

I was really rather surprised at how well this very simple recipe worked out.  Admittedly, I didn't follow the ingredients exactly, but that was just because I wanted my choice of fresh vegetables instead of canned or frozen veggies.

I was impressed that this pot pie was hearty without being heavy.  Other talked of adding extra cans of soup or adding milk, but I was happy with the lightness.  Everyone will have to tweak to his or her liking, of course.  I do think that four chicken breast halves is about one too many, at least for the size dish I was using.  Also, it is worth noting that you'll probably want to partially cook slow cooking veggies such as potatoes, carrots, or squash before you put them in the pot pie and bake it.

I think the biggest appeal of this dish is its simplicity, both in having the "comfort" quality in its ingestion, and its easy preparation.  When I prepare this in the future I plan on adding a bit more black pepper and maybe some cumin.  I hope others will try this and enjoy it as well.

I'm all for easy/quick meals...and this fits!  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a couple more things...but willing to guess it just didn't list everything used like some recipes on here...not doubt it's great!  Salt and Pepper is a given I'm sure, I used garlic powder as well.  Also use 1 large or 2 small potatoes, cubed...2 stalks celery diced, small white onion diced...which takes the place of the creamed soup to make it thick.  Use 1/3-1/2 bag frozen peas and carrots...think it's a great recipe!  TY for sharing!

The great thing about this recipe is that it was so easy to put together.  I thought it was very good.  We used the frozen vegetables with broccoli and caulflower.  It was great!

It doesn't get much easier than this.  Very good, very simple.  Use your own tastes or cravings to modify how you want to season and it will still come out great.

It was good but a little too salty for me.  I probably would prefer fresh veggies.  Need to find a substitute for the cream of chicken since I don’t like "soups from a can" for cream bases.  Family loved it, though!  I will make this again

This is a good idea, alot faster. The only change I made was I used pre cooked carrot, onion and celery and a 1/2 can of peas instead of the can of mixed veggies. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing and I will make again. Thanks!

Oh soooooo delish! Hubby is just as picky as our 5 yo when it comes to eating veggies. They both loved it! Our daughter didn't even mention the fact it had veggies in it (normally when eating them she'll make herself sick). Will make this over and over again! I used chicken tenders and boiled them. Of course I added some basic spices, including garlic. I only used one can of soup and it was very moist and saucey, but I did mix it with some milk before topping and stirring. I half baked the bottom crust first. Used frozen mixed veggies and some leftovers I had (corn, potatoes o'brien, peas.) Definately becoming permanent on our dinner list!

I have never made pot pie before, and this was so easy.  I used pre made roll out crust, 2 cans cream of chicken soup, frozen broccoli and corn.  I cooked up some chicken legs that needed to be used, and cut the meat off the bone.  Added some garlic, salt, and pepper.  Great recipe for a cold day!

As other reviewers suggested, I used a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of cream of celery. I poached 3 chicken breasts in chicken stock with parsley flakes and thyme, and once they were done, threw the frozen mixed veg in as well. It made enough sauce that we're having a second pot pie with dinner tonight- I just poured what was left after making the first pot pie into a freezer bag and thawed it in the fridge for a day. It's so good and easy, and the cream of celery soup makes it a little lighter tasting. I'm going to try adding some diced potato!

Pretty good. I made the crust which came from another pot pie recipe from this site (doesn't affect this rating).  I did add some thyme and garlic powder for extra flavor.  I wish I'd added another can of soup mix because it turned out a little dry.  It did have a nice flavor though. After making a couple changes I'd make this again.

I tried with the cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup with a little milk.  I also used some frozen stir fry veggies.  What an easy and awesome meal. Husband loved it-couldn't get over how beautiful it looked when it came out of the oven.  Great for chilly nights!

Per other reviews, I added garlic powder, celery salt and dried minced onion to the mixture along with a sprinking of parmesan cheese across the top of the filling before putting the crust on. Very well received by my husband who ate three helpings!  Delicious!

Thawed frozen veggies are always a nice alternative.  I had to use homemade cream of chicken soup to comply with my wife's dietary restrictions.  My family loved it but wanted more soup in it.  I found it a bit bland, but easily fixed with salt or garlic salt.  Watch out if you're counting carbs - this can  be very starchy depending on your choice of soup and crust.

This will be a new "regular".  I used frozen vegetables instead of canned, and a pre-made crust.  I also boiled the chicken with bulion and thyme to give it some extra flavor.  Even my 4 year old ate it up.

I cooked this, and it was so easy, and i loved it, but i was wondering how to make it lower in sodium. I'm thinking maybe if i found a lower sodium cream of chicken soup. But thanks for the reviews, it helped.

This was soooooooooo yummy! Such an easy and quick meal to make!
I took the advice from someone else and put in a can of Mushroom Soup and also used fresh veggies! 
I can't get enough! Would be better in individual pie shells as the big one it all collapses. :)

We really loved this! I just added a few spices as other suggested. (pepper, lawrys, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder) And next time I want to add some potatoes. Maybe canned ones. Oh, and I also use the pre done crust that comes rolled up. Yummy!!

Oh ya, I also used a Large can of cream of mushroom, and added 1/2 cup of milk. Oh, and frozen veggies instead of canned. (cooked them for a few minutes first.) I also boiled the chicken with a couple of boulion cubes. Just use what you have on hand to add your own special taste.  BTW it was also really easy to make.

This was excellent!  I added a can of cream of chicken, 1/2 C. milk. I also grated some zucchini, chopped an onion & sauted both a little before mixing everything together.  It was delicious!

This was tasty and easy to prepare.  I added a cup of chicken gravy to give it a little more sauce.  Will make this again.

This was delicious!  Even my kids ate all the veggies.  It was simple and I used chicken leg meat.  I estimate this meal to be under $5.

My husband LOVED this dinner dish! I added milk to my soup, used fresh veggies from the Farmer's Market (cooked them a tiny bit) and cooked my chicken in garlic. The dich is heavy, so be sure and use a glass baking dish. My tin dish folded in the middle on me when I took it out of the oven. It wasn't pretty but it tasted great!

Had this for dinner last night and left overs for lunch today!! Wonderful!! We did add chopped onion to it. With 20 minutes left on the baking, we threw some frozen biscuits into the oven -- same temperature -- and had a wonderful dinner! Will definitely make this again!

I tried this recipie for the first time and twicked it a little. Instead of boiling the chicken i diced them and then seasoned it with seasoning salt and meat tender seasoning then put it to bake. Also when mixing the cream of chicken with the veggies and chicken i also added at can of regular milk. it made it thicker and a bit more rich. it came out soooooo wonderful! My mother loves it! now she begs me to make it more often. its wonderful! i love it

My family loves this!  Everyone including my picky toddler. Ihave had 3 people ask me for the recipe after coming to my house and eating this. I did make some changes.  I use frozen veggies instead of canned.  I added a cup of milk, salt, pepper, dried minced onions, and some basil.  This is the perfect healthy dinner that I can get everyone to eat.

the recipe was very good..The cost of boneless chicken is sky high so i boiled a whole chicken,cut it up and used that in the pot pie..to further my money i used the broth from the boiled chicken to make chicken soup. I tweaked the recipe some..1 can cream of chicken soup,1can cream of mushroom soup,garlic powder,salt ,pepper,thyme and added frozen peas and carrots.Oh yea,used the pilsbury creasent roll dough..great idea. It was awesome..hubby loved it and the ANTI-VEGGIE 7 year old gobbled it up! Thanks for the great tips !!!!!!

loved this recipe it was soooooooo easy my family loved it, My eleven year son helped me and said lets keep this one what I really liked it came out looking like something that took a lot of effort but my son could make it, and I am sure he will, The only thing I changed I used frozen mixed vegies which I think tasted fresher and added garlic powder and pepper and added some jar mushrooms for a little extra

I thought the chicken pot pie was good, but a little bland.  I made it again and added garlic powder, onions, parsley, thyme, pepper, and Mrs. Dash.  Wow!!  Superb!!

This was an easy and delicious recipe for chicken pot pie. I used one of those rotisserie chickens from the hot food section of the grocery store because they are so tender and juicy. I also used frozen veggies instead of canned. Next time I think I will add half a can more of the cream of chicken soup because it was a little stiffer than I would have preferred. Overall, this was a great recipe to get me started on making my first chicken pot pie.

Easy and tasty. I used Pillsbury deep dish crust found in the freezer section. Boiled 3 chicken breasts in chicken broth and drained. In the same pot, I added in 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup since that's all I had, added a bag of defrosted frozen veggies, dashes of thyme, granulated onion, pepper, and baked until golden brown. So delicious!

So so, save it for when you're really in a hurry, or maybe just cooking for kids. I added garlic, onion, red papper, and it STILL was kind of bland. Also, if I make this again I'll probably just make my own white sauce.

I made some changes - used pre-roasted chicken, used 1 can lowfat cream of chicken and 1 can lowfat cream of mushroom soup as well as some diced parboiled potatoes and frozen peas and carrots. Added some salt and pepper to taste and voila - it was great.

I would say this is an average recipe for pot pie. It wasn't spectacular, but then I never was a huge fan of pot pie in the first place. I added 1/2 cup condensed milk to the cream of chicken soup along with 1/8 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp Mrs. Dash Original and a pinch of oregano along with a bit of black pepper. It came out well, and I will probably make it again sometime in the future. It's easy, simple, and good for a cold day.

I really think this recipe is really great.I found that to heat this recipe up is to add just a little bit of water to it so that it keeps it's moisture.

I'm always looking for ways to get my little one to eat vegetables and this recipe is just the thing. So simple but good. DH prefers this to other pot pie recipes. Added mushrooms as my family can't get enough of it and used premade pie crusts. Just pop it in the oven and your done.

Quick, easy and oh so tasty.  I used two 10oz cans of white chicken instead of the chicken breasts.  I made two packets of chicken gravy (like McCormick's as it seemed a little dry), added a shake or two of thyme and salt and mixed it with the chicken and 2 cans of veg-all.  Store bought crust in a deep dish pie plate. We enjoyed this with a tossed salad on the side!

This was so good! I started out with leftover fried chicken from KFC, which I skinned and deboned. I added 1 can cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, some italian seasoning, and some salt and pepper. So yummy!

I made this for dinner tonight, my family loved it! I did not make to exact specs. I cooked the chicken (salt & peppered) in a frying pan, I added 1/2 tsp thyme, I used VEG-ALL canned veggies, and used Cream of Mushroom soup because that is what I had on hand. Also I used a frozen pie crust...because I don't make pie crust!

My modifications: salt & pepper, leftover chicken  and some homemade chicken soup (my husbands idea!).  I used 3/4 bag frozen mixed veggies. Was much better than expected! I will be making this again.

The only change I made was adding a little milk to the mix and some salt, pepper and thyme like some others had suggested.  I loved it, and my husband said it was the best thing I had made so far!

Really good. I was able to make 2 STUFFED 9 inch pies with this. The only thing was it was a bit on the dry side. On the second "pie", I mad an additional can of cream of chicken soup on the side so that when everyone took their piece, they were also able to take some soup to pour on top. Other than that, GREAT RECIPE!!

This is extremely easy and very, very good. I used leftover chicken from a roast chicken I had the night before. I added cheddar cheese to the dish, and next time, I think I would add even more. I also added some left-over green beans amd mushrooms. My husband was very impressed!
