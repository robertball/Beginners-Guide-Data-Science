There are some things in life that demand attention from the point of tradition, chitterlings a.k.a. “chittlins” is one of them. 

This dish is not for the lazy kitchen cook, (and you know who you are) it can take more than a full day to clean, prepare and cook chitterlings correctly especially if they are fresh. There are two rules that must be adhered to up front:
1.	If your chitterlings stink before and during the cleaning process they are fresh!
2.	If your chitterlings continue to stink while cooking, they are not clean enough!

Two soakings in cold water does not cut it, for chitterlings to be clean they should be almost as transparent as a wet paper towel when held up to the light. Use vinegar and plenty of it during the entire process of cooking chitterlings, remember these are the intestines of an animal as to minimize the potential of contamination of your chitterlings all caution must be observed. Keep your hands clean during the process, (recommend you cut your fingernails short as well). 

Chitterlings like greens; make water…..do not fill the pot up to the brink with water less you will have a pot that will overflow on the stove for sure. Depending on the number of pounds you’re preparing, the pot need not be more than a quarter ways filled with water. Remember also that chitterlings cook down, so the weight before cooking will dramatically be reduced after they cook. (15lbs of chitterlings cooks down to about 7lbs).

Now comes the seasoning of the water:

This recipe is fine, but I would bring to a boil, drain, add water again, and then add your onions, red pepper, and garlic.  If you don't do this, you will have fat on top to deal with.

I like this recipe. I do similiar but for 20 lbs, I parboil twice, draining after each boil. Then in a large pot, cover chitlins with water, add 2 chicken bouillion cubes, 1/2 cup white vinegar, crushed red pepper flakes to taste, and Adobo All-Purpose Seasoning With Pepper to taste. I've never added onions but will try it next time. Mother added a potato to her chitlins to cut grease.  Also, the Sylvia Robinson recipe says to soak overnight in salt water to cut grease.

I am very surprised to see a recipe for chitterlings..it is true this is like a southern delicacy..lol..this recipe is good, however, I also add bellpeppers, seasoned salt, preferable Lawry's, and chopped jalapenos..and if you ever cook chitterlings you'll know they're not the most pleasant thing to smell..My remedy for that is to also add potatoes as it cuts down on the smell..Very good you must have it with hot sauce or you're just not eating it right..Thanks for submitting this recipe..it's good to know that someone else appreciates a good southern cuisine.

This is the perfect recipe. Don't forget the hot sauce. I clean and cook at least 30 lbs. Just make sure you cook them until they are tender. If you clean them correctly, there's no need to par boil, you take away the flavor. Another tip, you can purchase cleaned chitterlins, 5 lb. bags each. They may need to be split open. I still check to make sure they are fully cleaned. Saves a lot of time, but oh so delicious.

Now you're talking! Finally a recipe that a lot of people in the South truly love. This recipe is great! When I cook mine, I cleaned them multiple times and then I cut them in small pieces before I boil them. Then, for a more robust flavor, after about an hour of cooking, I add beer, potatoes, onions and hot sauce or red pepper sauce to it. After they cook down, they will be very tasty and tender.

To feed 12 people, you need closer to 20 pound of chitterlings!  You may want to add salt AFTER your chitterlings have cooked down a bit.  They may become too salty otherwise.  I use Creole seasoning instead of salt and pepper along with extra garlic and red pepper flakes.

Great recipe...just like mom use to make...The recipe is great the way it is written..no need to add potatoes, they take away from the taste of the chitterlings. I prepared it over the holidays and had meatless spaghetti, cole slaw, and cornbread..Yummy!!

chitlins themselves are wonderful i cleaned some last night and am cooking them NOW!but 10 pounds of chitlins is not enough for 10 people because the shrink really bad when you cook them,so to feed 10 people you will need 20 lbs cleaned chitlins.and in GA after we boil them we put them in spider(skillet)with a little grease and fry them and that believe it our not draws some of the grease out of them!

This was my favorite chitts recipe from reading the narrative.  I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and would like to suggest what tastes best for my family. They prefer only a small amount of onion, not a whole onion; cleaning well is the first step, but it is not necessary to pour off the water several times once the chitts begin to cook; once is enough.
Finally, for seasonings the tried and true salt, a little red pepper and maybe white pepper, and a small amount (very small) amount of vinegar...1 teaspoon will do.
In terms of the smell; the true chittlin lover absolutely loves the smell of chitts cooking. That is part and parcel of the enjoyment.
So, try them; experiment with flavors, but just give me salt, red pepper and a touch of vinegar...that will do.  And, please cook them for more than 4 hours.  It is not a matter of tenderness; it is a matter of doneness.  Cook them from 8 to 12 hours and they will be tender...and done!

This is an excellent recipe, but what I do is after cleaning them thoroughly, I pre-cook the chitterlings for 1 1/2 hours, rinse them until the water is clear and then proceed to season them and let them simmer for at least 5hrs in a slow cooker or a huge roaster(I cook no less than 60lbs each time). Chitterlings should NOT smell while they are cooking.  If they do, they are not clean and if grease settles in them, they still are not clean.  The juice from the chittlerlings should GEL up, not GREASE up.  Grab the hotsauce and enjoy1

Great recipe. My suggestion is to also try cooking them in a slow cooker! I cook them on LOW overnight. Wake up to check them maybe once or twice. The entire process usually takes about 10 hours in the slow cooker, but it is soooo worth the wait. Very tender and juicy.  So good that my family says that there nevee enough.  Hope this helps :-)

my grandparents always taught me to soak chittlins in cold salt water for an hour or 2 before the cleaning process. after cleaning the water must be changed several times adding salt to the water. the salt really draws out the blood in the intestines. you'd be surprised how clear the water will be by the last washing. we also chop up an onion, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, a whole potato, salt to taste, and white pepper instead of black pepper, also you can put a little apple cidar vinegar in too. we also have a family friend who cooks hers with a can of beer added for tenderness. when ready to eat put hot sauce on(franks), and throw down!

This is an excellent recipe for chitterlings. They came out perfect. I first brought them to a boil for about 10 minutes and then drained them. With fresh water, just enough to cover, I used one large onion quartered,1 stalk celery coarsely chopped, 1/2 jalapeno chopped and seeded, 2 chicken bouillon cubes(I didn't have any stock)1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt , crushed pepper flakes. I forgot to add the garlic. Simmered for 6 hours. My husband and daughter said the were very good. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

To save on time, I put the chitlins in my preesure cooker to cut the cooking time in half. My family has been eating chitlins before I was born. We absolutely love them. I forgot to mention I also add hog maws to 
the chilins.

No way this will feed 12 people.  This recipe is tried and true.  I have been using the same recipe for years.  For the naysayers, just try them before you knock them.  You may be surprised with the results.

This recipe is fine however in Louisiana we cook ours with lots of apple cider vinegar. 50/50 vinegar water. Sage, black pepper, and a jalapeno also add a nice touch.

After cleaning 40 lbs of chitlins, I was looking for something quick and easy to get my chitlins cooking. This was easy and my chitlins were delicious; just like my mom and grandma used to make. Thank you!

Fellow southerner here, and this recipe hit the spot. I've had my share of chitlins, but never have i done them myself. The one thing that i did was during the final boil to toughin the chitlins added the white vinegar. And still they came out great. But this was a successful trial run with 20lbs of chitlins.

Excellent recipe. I love Chitterlings. But I don't trust just anyone cooking them for me. I was rise by my great grandmother ( a southerner ) and at an early age she taught my sisters and I how to properly clean and cook them. If cleaned properly there is no need for multiple rinses. Yes it is a very long process. But well worth the time if you know what you're doing. I use all ingredients listed plus I add Sazo'n Goya seasoning (must try) puts a spin on em and gives a little more flavor. Seeing how I'm the only one in my household that eats them I only use a 10 pound bucket (more than enough for me). I'm in hog heaven right now. Thanks for the share. And Happy Holidays!

This is an awesome recipe!!  in addition to the basic receipt, I added lemon pepper, green pepper, a packet of soy sauce.  
I also cooked them in an iron Dutch oven. They came out super tender.  I will definitely use this recipe from now on - for sure!!!

I haven't made this as I live in France, and have never seem them to buy.  However, as a child in North Devon, UK, my mother used to fry them in the pan with some bacon.  They became very crisp and crunchy and absolutely delicious.

I was looking for good basic recipe for chitterlings and discovered this.  The only change I made was to just smash garlic cloves and quarter the onion so that I had the flavor but didn't have those small bits to contend with.  I also made sure to THOROUGHLY clean, rinse and repeat until the water was clear.  The smell (and you know that smell) was significantly lessened.  While I don't eat chitterlings more that a few times a year, this recipe is a keeper.

This ius a great recipe for cooking chitterlings.  it doesn't include potatoes, as I can see, but one poster said she uses them.

Potatoes cooked in chitterlings are not meant to eat, although they certainly can be eaten if you wish.  

The purpose of adding potatoes is for them to soak up the excess fat/grease that is in the broth when they are cooked.

I plan on making 10 pounds for Thanksgiving, since it is only my sister and me.

Haven't had them in quite a while, so this will truly be a treat!

Perfect!! Thanks. Yes the trick for the smell is to clean them well even the pre cleaned ones.
