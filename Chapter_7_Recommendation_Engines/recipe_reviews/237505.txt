For my tastes there are too many flavors going on here.  I would leave the chocolate chips out if using the filling and topping.  I also thought it was too sweet so I would either top it or fill it but not both.  It did bake up nice and moist.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was and when the cake came out, it was somewhat harder on the outside than the inside. The inside was not as moist as I wanted it to be, but it was okay. The weird thing was that I even shortened the time it asked for to 5 minutes less (different ovens I thought might require different cooking time). I don't know what happened, but if there is a trick to making this cake a bit more moist and not too hard on the outside, I would give it a 4.5.

I put 4 small eggs instead of 3 large ones as a result the cake is a little crumbly. That is the only thing I would do differently next time.  
However, the cake turned out very nicely. I quite like the brown sugar and cinnamon filling and the nuts + brown sugar topping.  It was very well received by my family. I will definitely make it again!!
