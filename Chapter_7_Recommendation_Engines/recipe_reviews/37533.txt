This is fantastic. For peanut butter bark, omit the nuts, but stir 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter into the white chocolate.  Yum!!  Looks great with holiday candies, too.

Yum! This marble bark is so simple and soooo delicious!  I added roasted hazelnuts and experimented with dark, milk, and white chocolate.  It turned out good everytime.  Plus there is no baking!
