Great recipe, with a few changes. I thought the recipe was a little bland by itself, so i added 1/2 cup of red, green, and yellow peppers, and a 1/2 cup of onions. I was out of oregano, so I substituted the spice with Italian seasoning> With a little bit of pepper, this dish came out wonderfully! Excellent taste, I'll try making patties next time.

This is really quite tasty.  It is great just following the recipe or for a little added flair  add some chopped green pepper or about 1/2 cup shredded fresh zucchini.

Very tasty vegetarian loaf. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, using the whole 24 ounce container of cottage cheese which I had purchased and reducing the milk to half. I had no mushrooms, so I grated 3 carrots and one small zuchinni and stirred that in. I only used saltines (2 Pks) instead of the buttery crackers and I added a splash, maybe 2 tablespoons,  of olive oil to add some fat because I used lowfat cottage cheese and the replaced the buttery crackers. Everything else was the same amounts and it was yummy and made a very tall 13 x 9 pan. Would like to try it with the mushrooms next time for the meatier texture.

I loved this recipe! It was a little bland on its own, so I added half a cup of green bell pepper and zuccini each.

It seemed to me that the recipe asked for too much of the spices (a whole tablespoon of sage?  garlic powder?) so I halved them.   My husband and I were not crazy about the recipe, however, I took it for lunch cold the next day and I really liked it!

I have rarely found a recipe on here this bad!  It was edible but gluey and blah!  Even tried topping it with salsa to help it.  I wish it had tasted like it sounded.  It was more like oatmeal. I googled Cottage Cheese Loaf and found some much better sounding dishes!  Sorry!

Turned out a little bland.  Made a mushroom gravy to pour over the top, which helped the flavor out a bit.  Just needed something.....  With a little work & some spice adjustment, this could be fantastic!

This recipe did not turn out well for me but it may have been my own fault. First of all I forgot to pick up the buttery rounds crackers at the store so I just replaced them with more saltines. I also made a double-batch thinking I could freeze some for future meals. 

I divided the mixture into two baking dishes but still had to bake them for almost triple the time called for in the recipe as it was soupy.
 
After it cooled a little I cut a piece and found it was still not very firm.The taste was not bad but it reminded me more of stuffing than of meatloaf. Maybe because of all the spices? 

I refrigerated the leftovers and plan to heat it up for dinner tonight. Maybe it will be better the second time around. I think the other reviewers were probably right in adding a little green pepper or something else to jazz it up a little.

Pretty good, just squishy and pale and salty -- if you're the kind of person who likes things like stuffing, you'll love this.  It'd probably work well for picky kids too.
