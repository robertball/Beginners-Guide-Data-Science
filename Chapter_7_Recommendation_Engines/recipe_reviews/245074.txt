12-28-15 ~ FANTASTIC! This is one of the BEST recipes that I have made in 2015. I made a double batch, but only had one can of green chilies so I diced up a jalapeño to make up the difference. This is not a low calorie soup, so since I was making a double batch, I used heavy cream and half and half to make it lower in calories. The flavors in the soup blend and work really well together. My DH and I loved this soup. It hit the spot on a rainy and icy December day!

One word:  DELICIOUS!!!  My husband who isn't a soup lover reluctantly took a bite and never came up for air until the bowl was empty...and then went back for seconds!!   I made it to recipe except I realized too late I was out of chicken broth so I used vegetable broth instead as that was all I had left in my pantry after all the holiday cooking.  This is my new best soup recipe and would highly recommend it.  Next time I want to try it with 1/2 and 1/2..

I didn't have green chiles, but I did have a can of chipotle peppers. I used two small ones, chopped up.  I also added some smoked paprika because I LOVE it.  The soup was wonderful!

I'm putting this one in my recipe book! Great! I love that this is fast and easy and I think this is pretty flexible too. I doubled this for my family of 6 and we had some leftovers. We loved the taste of this, but I did a few additions as well as subtractions. I added 2 cans of various beans (Great Northern and Tri-Bean, which is Kidney, Black and Pinto mixed together) then I only had 6 oz of cream cheese on hand, so I used that and added enough cottage cheese to make up the lack. I cut back on the water by 1/2 a cup and the cream by about a cup because I wanted a thicker consistency. I also added a can of whole corn. Very yummy. Thanks!

Loved it!  I didn’t have heavy cream so I used half and half and Plain Greek yogurt!  It was delicious.

I added 1/2 cup cooked beats and 14 oz sweet roasted corn to mine and doubled the amount of chicken. Delicious!

This was good, quick, kids liked dipping taquitos in it.  Quite rich though- wonder what evaporated milk would do?  Did use low fat cream cheese with no problem

Loved this recipe! I like things spicier, so I added more cayenne pepper, cumin, & garlic.

This reminds me of a crockpot recipe I have but this is better. I didn't have roasted tomatoes so I used fresh medium picante and adjusted my seasonings. I'll be making this again.
