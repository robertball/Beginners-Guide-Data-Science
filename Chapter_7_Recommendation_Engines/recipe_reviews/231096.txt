I don't make biscuits often, tho' curiously I've made them twice this week. Both these and Kentucky Biscuits, also from this site, were winners.  Tender, fluffy and light, these are equally as good warm with butter as they are without.  This recipe, unlike the other, did not call for any sugar - I didn't miss it, so why add it? Rather than shortening I used cold butter from the fridge and grated it into the flour with a box grater.  That made quick work of blending it!  I do have self-rising flour, but I was too lazy to dig it out from the pantry.  A cup of all-purpose flour mixed with 1-1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/4 tsp. salt did the trick.  I did NOT knead for two minutes - just a few turns is what I did, because I did not want to overwork the dough.  I swear, THAT and buttermilk, are the secrets to a fine biscuit! Once again, I regrettably only made a half recipe. Thankfully, another half recipe can be mixed up in a jiffy! Note: I was also too lazy to dig out my rolling pin and roll them out.  Patting the dough out with my fingers seemed to work just fine.

I will definitely make it  again. They were perfectly fluffy and delicious. I love them!

P.S.
If you don't have butter milk you can mix 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar, with 1 cup of milk.
Also, if you don't have self rising flour, you can mix 1 cup of all-purpose flour with 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
Plus, I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of Crisco, just let it melt some before you mix it in.

I brushed each biscuit with melted butter before baking them in the oven. One of the BEST biscuits I've ever made. Light, fluffy and absolutely delicious. We ate every single one of them.

For only four ingredients, these are terrific!  I probably should've made them a little bigger, but they rolled out perfectly, and the dough was very easy to work with.  They have a little crispiness on the outside, but the insides are like little soft pillows of goodness.  Thanks for this easy recipe!

This is definitely my go-to recipe for biscuits. They turn out perfectly every single time, and people beg me to make them. Don't knead the dough though, as this makes it too tough. Just is it enough to incorporate the ingredients well, and then handle the dough as little as possible to keep the biscuits super light and fluffy. Give this recipe a try- you will not be dissapointed!

I've been using this site for many years without registering; I registered JUST to review these biscuits. They are fantastic! Followed recipe exactly 3 times so far and they come perfect every time. Thanks for submitting this.

I make strawberry shortcake with a biscuit shortcake. I've tried a lot od recipes, but this was the best I've found so far. I used softened butter instead of shortening and added a half cup of sugar so it would be sweet for shortcake. I cooked it in a pie plate on 375 for just under 30 minutes.

These are very very good. There were no leftovers after dinner. Something is missing though, and I can't figure out what it is. The texture of these biscuits is amazing, and they are very quick and easy to make. I will definitely make these again.

Update: I figured it out. It needed less shortening and instead some good old butter. Now they are fully five star worthy.

These were very good! Super simple to make, rose beautifully and tasted great (mine were kinda ugly looking, but it didn't matter, lol). My only thing is that I think they could use a bit of salt, but that's my personal preference. I made my own self-rising flour and buttermilk, and that worked out nicely. I would def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

First biscuits I ever made and now I am the Biscuit Guru! Made some changes as per others here: 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening. Eliminated baking soda, pinch of salt and bigger pinch of sugar. Fabulous!
Also cook them on a preheated pizza stone.

To make'm cheesier: cup of grated cheese, teaspoon dry mustard, pinch cayenne. Oooh baby.

This recipe is amazing.  I was a little leary after looking at the ingredients list, and while I didn't have butter flavored crisco, I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup Crisco And still came out great.

'Made these & "Buttermilk Biscuits I".  I liked the other ones better.  These were okay, but need some tweaking to be better than that.  The flour, shortening, buttermilk ratio seemed near perfect.  Often, much more flour is required than the recipe states; but not this one.  Nice change.  These have a beautiful golden finish, btw.

I am a 74 year old Southern woman who is a pretty good cook, but has never known how to make good biscuits, a veritable entree to Southern womanhood!  You’ve saved me from disgrace. These biscuits were light and. So fluffy that were “pull-aparts,” no cutting necessary. We loved them   Knew the recipe was a winner when I saw Crisco!  Can’t get much more authentic than that!  Thank you!

I make this recipe at least once a week.  They turn out great every time! A little tip to make it easier is instead of a round cutter I use a pizza cutter and make square biscuits.  No scraps left over!

I DIDNT MAKE THESE (so I gave five stars to not screw up the ratings.)

I’m going to try these BUT wanted to share: I make biscuits often and one thing I do which I think helps a lot is I put the baking sheet in the oven while oven preheats. This way it’s hot when biscuits go on and they get a tiny bit crisper on the bottom

Made these Christmas morning and they tasted great. I have never made biscuits before and these were not hard to make. I did use too small of a biscuit cutter and the biscuits were about the size of an Oreo cookie. Even though they were small they rose perfectly and were great.

The texture of the biscuits was nice, but they lacked flavor.  I liked them enough to make them again, but will definitely add some salt and brush with melted butter before baking.

I'm not a big fan of biscuits, but let me tell you these are AMAZING!  I followed the recipe,but I followed another reviewers tip and added melted butter to the tops before I baked them.  Try this biscuit recipe, you won't be sorry.

My first time ever making these biscuits. Made own SR flour according to instructions from experienced bakers. Used buttermilk,  and everything according to this recipe. Grating butter is an excellent idea, and I will be using that for other doughs requiring rubbing of butter and flour together. Dough was till a bit rough, and on the dry side, as I did not really kneed it. I flattened  it into shape with fingers, and cut into squares - 16 total. Brushed with melted butter before baking. Took 17 minutes in my oven on 400. Bottoms nicely done, tops on a light gold color. Lightly crispy all around but flaky, fluffy and soft on inside.  Excellent  results - really good biscuits. Will try adding shredded cheese next time for variety. Very happy with this recipe.  Thank you to all reviewers for helpful hints. Makes a big difference, especially for first time recipe user. I will make a large amount of prepared dry mix of ingredients, so the next time I want to bake biscuits, all that is needed to do will be adding grated butter, butter milk - and baking!  Delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I’ve made it twice now and they are sooo light and fluffy and airy! So far I’ve not been able to get buttermilk so I’ve had to make my own with milk and lemon juice and had no problems. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and just turned the dough a couple of times before  patting it out with my hands. Easy peasy. If I had known making biscuits was this quick and easy I would’ve done it years ago! I’m never buying canned again! Thank you so much to the original poster for this great recipe!

This is the first biscuit recipe that actually tasted like a biscuit and also rised for me. I had to make a few changes. I didn't have self rising flour so I used 1 3/4 cup all purpose flour and 3 tsp of baking Powder. I didn't have butter shortening so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening. I will be making these again!

I've been trying to make tall, fluffy biscuits for about four years. My biscuits never even resembled the pictures. This recipe made tall, fluffy biscuits. The recipe was easy to follow  and the biscuits were delicious. I'm so happy I've finally did it. Now I'm looking for meals that will go with biscuits.

I tried this recipe pretty much as written. Just added 2 tsp. of sugar as my personal touch and used unsalted butter instead of shortening. I proceeded as usual without overworking the dough. The biscuits came out DELICIOUS! Golden, fluffy on the inside, and a bit crispy on the outside. I absolutely recommend it. Also, it was very fast to prepare.

This is basically it. Naturally, I varied. The butter or shortening is well chilled and then diced before blending to delay melting. I use AP Flour rather than Self Rising. King Arthur AP is best but Gold Medal is fine, too. Baking Powder, of course. If no Buttermilk is handy, I use plain yogurt diluted with a little water. Today's Cultured Buttermilk is not what Buttermilk used to be. I roll the dough, cut, fold and beat (tap) with a rolling dowl, fold and beat again. The layering really adds to the flakey quality. I brush the tops with a little milk and water before the oven.

Followed the recipe but they turned out hard and flat. Not sure if the dough shouldn't be kneaded so much or if I rolled them out too thin. Hmmmm

I followed many others and added a pinch of salt and sugar, and the baking soda. I also used butter, and a spray of spray butter on each before I baked them. The non biscuit eater boyfriend loved them as well!

I just made these biscuits. I used all fresh ingredients and followed the recipe and instructions TO THE LETTER and they didn't rise AT ALL. Very disappointed.

I gotta be honest, I don't add sriracha when I make these. It's a great basic recipe.  I have made cheddar garlic biscuits with this recipe (you know, like the ones from that restaurant that serves lobster) by just adding about a cup of shredded cheese, chives and garlic powder. Yum! And so easy, too!! Thanks for posting!!

Great recipe! First time making buttermilk biscuits and my family devoured them. Instead of shortening, I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 margarine. It worked perfectly. Can't wait to make these again!

These are great old fashioned type biscuits. They are so easy to make and taste great. My whole family loves them too. We like to use them for biscuits and gravy or just butter and jelly. Have used this recipe many times and will continue to do so without changing the recipe at all!

Ok so I have no idea where I went wrong. I followed directions and my biscuits were flat as can be. Maybe there is a step missing to let them rise before baking? They get 3 stars cause they tasted like a good biscuit, but they certainly didnt look like one.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  Taste just like my grandmother made it.  Really easy.
I did substitute the 1/2 cup butter shortening with 1/4 cup cold butter and 1/4 shortening as I did not have the flavored shortening.

I used 3/4 cup butter-flavored shortening (such as Crisco®) instead. The biscuits were a little more moist.

These turned out much better than I thought they would.  I had to add additional cooking time (probably due to different types of oven temps) 20-25 minutes for them to cook & brown nicely.  Makes about 15 nice size hand rolled biscuits.

I made these in a short time and my friend said, where's the pack that came from.  I said they come from scratch and the first batch did not make it to the table.  They grabbed the butter and devoured them.  They were a bit and a new recipe for my cookbook,  BILLY MANUCY.  GREAT COOKING MISTAKES which came out and sold out in 2008.  Number 2 is on its way.

Fantastic recipe!  I did not have butter crisco so I used 1/2 cup regular crisco shortening and two tablespoons butter.  Fluffy on the inside and brown on the top and bottom - perfect biscuits!

Somewhat lacking in flavor or complexity, the simplicity of the recipe still demands some respect. A decent biscuit when balling on a budget.

The only thing I changed is that I serve them hot.  I live in the south, and we don't want our biscuits cool.  I also make a double batch, roll and cut, and then freeze on a cookie sheet.  Once they are frozen, put them in a freezer bag and just take out the number needed for the meal.  Super easy.  

I also bake mine at 400 rather than 450, but I think that is just a  difference in the oven.

I made 1/2 recipe and carefully measured the halved ingredients. Flat and tasteless, even though I added a tsp. of sugar and brushed the tops with melted butter. I didn't have buttermilked, so I soured it with a tsp. of vinegar.

We did enjoy it, but because of the self rising flour which I do not usually have on hand, it would be inconvenient to make it regularly.  It was a good recipe and tasty for someone who keeps all the ingredients handy regularly. I will make it again when I can.

I made these biscuits exactly by the recipe.  They raised well & looked beautiful but we felt they were tasteless.  We ate them but I threw the leftovers away.  I will stick to my old stand by Better Homes & Garden recipe from the sixties.

Made these for dinner with beef stew. Husband loved them. Found the butter chunks in the batter melted into cookie sheet and made bottom of biscuit overly browned. Will give them less time next time I make them

Definitely needed a little salt. I would also have added a bit of sugar, though it was good with the ginger rhubarb jam I'd made last summer.

So easy.  SO PERFECT.  Thank you for sharing the recipe Carol Reese H.  I used butter instead of Crisco.  I didn't even know it comes in "butter flavored".  And I took Naples34102 advice and grated the butter into the flour mixture and so easy to cut in butter.  I may just forget I have my pastry cutter out in the garage.  Thank you ma'am, (ahm, Ms. Naples34102).   No rolling or kneading here either because that would bring out the gluten and make the biscuits really chewy and tough.  A superb biscuit recipe.

I followed recipe as close as I could and was pleased with the results. I used real butter instead of shortening and made my own buttermilk using white vinegar. The flavor was good and I will make these again!

Great biscuits-. Flakey and great taste. It’s a keeper. 
Cut time to 8 min, Guess over bakes a little hot even though third party thermometer used to check temp.

This is a great recipe. My only suggestion is to bake the biscuits in a pan with higher sides and to place the biscuits close to each other so they touch. Brush with melted butter when they come out of the oven. That makes the best biscuit!

I've never had biscuits, but this recipe caught my eye. Wow! So delicious! I didn't have self-rising flour, so I had to sort of make my own. For this recipe I used 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, minus 1 tbsp, plus 3 1/3 tsp baking powder plus 3/4 tsp salt. I also used salted butter instead of Crisco. They turned out a little on the salty side, so I'd likely reduce to 1/2 tsp salt next time. I followed someone else's directions to not over-knead the dough. I just mixed it around with my hands a bit until it was dough-like, rolled it a bit, but and baked. Brilliant!

These came out wonderfully! I didn’t have self rising flour or buttermilk so I used vinegar and baking powder as alternatives. I might try real butter next time or add a bit more salt for extra flavor. This is our new favorite biscuit recipe for sure.

This is a very good recipe, easy for the new bakers. I've made biscuts for about 42 years. 
 All I changed was browning them  just a little darker and brushing them down with BUTTER when they come out of the oven. I love the crunch on the bottoms.

I have not made biscuits from scratch in many years.  It was delish. This brought back wonderful memories when my mother and grandmother were alive when they made Buttermilk Biscuits. Thank you for sharing your recipe. :)

This is my go-to recipe for biscuits taught to me by my dear southern sister-in-law!  I use a bit less shortening,  but melt 2 Tbls. on the cookie sheet and let cool while cutting biscuits.  I dip each biscuit in the melted shortening before baking.  Also, I once tried to add vinegar to milk when I didn't have buttermilk, and they were awful!  Ditto trying to make self rising flour.  Not worth trying to tweak recipe!  By the way, your biscuits get better with practice!

Delicious, and easy. I made them small and square, and (since it's fall) painted them with a butter, cinnamon, clove, sugar glaze to add a hint of sweetness. Set the table with butter, jelly, honey, peanut butter, and anything else you like on biscuits, and have fun!

Salt?    I noticed the recipe didn't call for salt, but I always follow a recipe exactly at least the first time.  These are bland to say the least and the fat content is a little unnecessarily high.  I'm disappointed.  I suppose I will make something extra salty to serve with them.

This biscuits were delicious. I should have followed some reviews and brushed a little melted butter on them before baking but even without that they were yummy. Oh I also used butter instead of shortening.

Really nice, light, fluffy biscuits.  Used butter instead of shortening.  Kind of small with doing 12, might do 6-8 instead next time.

Good basic biscuit recipe BUT... when I made them they did not rise at all. The flavor was about what I expected. Next time though, I'll add 2 teaspoons of baking powder so they should rise properly.
