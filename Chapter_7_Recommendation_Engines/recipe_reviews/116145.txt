This was four stars as is and five with a few add-ins.  Absolutely delicious.  I used Feta cheese instead of blue-thats what I had on hand and I added in some fresh parsley with the basil.  It def needs more salt than specified and I added a few dashes of paprika for some mild heat and a sprinkle of sugar.  Cannot wait to make for some company.

Amazing. Don't forget the lime juice and zest. It really makes this pop. I catered a holiday party with this and the double tomato bruschetta and they were a total hit

These are good. I used regular tomato because that's what I had, and would also recommend chopping your veggies smaller for easier eating. I'd like to try this again using goat cheese or a little feta. The blue cheese is great, but always a bit of a scene-stealer. Thanks for the recipe!

Really delicious! Like others, I had trouble keeping it on the bread. Also, I tried it with finely chopped White onion - also fabulous.

The flavors are great, but there's almost too many ingredients  to safely put on a piece of bread without some of them falling off.

I only used this recipe as an idea, I just used asparagus, tomotaoes, garlic, olive oil and seasoned feta cheese - very simple and elegant. I am sure the other ingrediants would have been nice but I did not think that they were necessary to the recipe and I did not have them on hand.

This was delicious!!!  I made it for a holiday party and the red and green colors were beautiful.  The taste was mouth watering.  We love asparagus, so it was a real treat!  Make sure that you use very "thin" asparagus spears, and don't overcook them.  Ice bath is essential!  Also, I made some with feta cheese, and some with goat cheese...I liked it better than the blue cheese!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was SO DELICIOUS as a dinner entree for my husband & I who are trying to eat healthier. I followed the recipe as stated but had to make the following substitutions Ran out of the lime so also used 1 TB Lemon juice along w/2 TB lime juice. No fresh basil so used 1/8 c dried basil. No grape tomatoes so chopped up 1 lg tomato (was about 1 3/4 cups total) Did add extra salt about 1/2 tsp kosher salt & also 1/2 tsp pepper (we like it spicy.) And then, not much blue cheese crumbles left so used some blue cheese dressing. The blue cheese dressing put this dish over the top! We served them open faced on toasted 9-grain bread halves. SO DELISH! Thank you for posting this. We will definitely be having this again. I can see this as a really good veggie sandwich on whole wheat rolls or in pitas. And it was amazing how the blue cheese dressing really transformed this into something really spectacular.

This is a very crisp and refreshing recipe for Bruschetta lovers.....we grilled the bread on charcoal and left the mixture in the refrigerator overnight and got raves from our guests.

My daughter made this and it was unique flavors. I agree about chopping it up and miing it a little to make it stay on the bread.

I was hesitant about the lime but it worked great. Didn't have green onions on hand, but chives and red onion worked well to substitute.

DELISH!! I served this before a barbecue and got rave reviews! I used fresh grated parmesan instead of the blue cheese and added a little more salt, but that is a matter of taste. I'll be making this again soon.

Only problem I found is that you really need to chop it up in order to get it on the bread.  Either by skinny aspargus or blend it into a salsa.  I salsafied it and it was a hit.

Made this early morning yesterday as a "healthy" appetizer for dinner with friends.  Rave, Rave, Rave reviews. Everyone loved it!!! And a friend of mine who publishes a monthly "Little Secrets" flyer is adding it to that.  We all agreed, we could eat it for breakfast, a side dish unto itself, or it would be great in an omelette, or on top of fish, etc. The only thing I would do different is cut the asparagus into smaller pieces - maybe 1/4. Just couldn't get enough on the bread!!! Great share, thank you Elaine!

This is a terrific appetizer!  I followed the recipe exactly, and was tempted to leave out the grated lime peel only because I was pressed for time, but I'm so glad I didn't.  I think it made the dish!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit! The asparagus and blue cheese give a great appetizer such a different twist.  It's easy and you will receive a ton of compliments!
