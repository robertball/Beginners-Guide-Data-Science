I made these into little tartlets for a party appetizer.  I cut the pie crust into little circles with a cookie cutter, and pressed them into my muffin pan.  I put the sauteed onions in the cups and poured the egg to about half-full.  I put the crumbled bacon on top before baking.  They were really delicious.  Everybody asked for the recipe.

I made this tart for two people - both of whom had never eaten an onion tart.  Each said it tasted good and wasn't too onion-y as one might expect from eating a bunch of onions in a pie crust.  (Even my three-year-old ate a sizeable piece of this.)  One commented that he might like to have more bacon in the recipe (but that might be because was was inclined toward more meat in a dish).  As for the recipe, I was concerned that there wasn't enough egg (I think I was expecting something more quiche-like), but in the end, everything seemed to go together quite well - meaning this recipe works.  If you like onion tart, I think this recipe will suit you.

Very tasty but a more work than the recipe implies.  Between frying the bacon, sauteeing the onions (you will want them almost carmelized, so it takes around 30 minutes), pre-baking the shell and everything, this recipe takes a few hours. The first time I made this, I took one of the previous reviwers suggestions and cut the pie crusts into little tartlets and pressed into muffin pans.  If you do this, use non-stick spray, as 1/2 of mine broke apart trying to extract them from the pan. I also used one extra egg since mine were very small, but I think you should stick to 2 small eggs or the tart won't be flat enough. (It is not supposed to be fluffy like a quiche.) And I wasn't sure how much of the mixture to put in the shell either; I'm guessing 1/2 full. Also, if you don't want your pie shell to be too moist/soft, prick the shell on the sides and bottom before baking, and brush a light egg wash on before pre-cooking it.  Finally, I suggest slicing your onions very thin, and use the sweet yellow variety.

This was amazingly easy and tasty. I had 2 bunches of leeks I needed to get rid of, so I used them as well. This one's a keeper.

i was told how to make this tart except the one change was to use a variety of onions--red, sweet, green, shallot, leek etc---and to always make sure to include a sweet onion--also to add a little shredded cheese--swiss or parmasan would be good i think

Delicious, simple, and quick!  I used Walla Walla sweet onions, and sauteed them until they were caramelized.  I left off the bacon, but next time, I think I'll make a bacon and mushroom topping to put on after the pie is baked, for those who want it.

This really didn’t fill up the pie shell…maybe one more onion and an additional egg???  I cooked for an additional 5 minutes, and I think another 5 may have been even better.  The recipe writer really gives you no idea what to look for as far as doneness; i.e., golden brown, knife inserted in the center comes out clean, etc., just to cook for approximately 20 minutes.  The garnish of the crumbled bacon seemed a little odd to me.  If I make this again, I’ll mix the crumbled bacon into the onion-egg mixture.  On the positive side, it does taste good.

I ended up melting the butter separate and whisking it with the eggs.  I used 5 eggs and could have used 6.  If I make it again I will add it bacon in the egg mixture.  I also added some leftover fondue cheese I had in the fridge.  This recipe has the potential to be excellent but it needs improvement.

Bf and I really enjoyed this. He is somewhat of a picky eater as well. I used 4 egg whites and 2 whole eggs. One whole onion seemed like a lot, I will add other items next time. Took around 40 mins to bake, I would increase the heat to 375 or 400.

This was pretty darn good. I made sure the onions were cooked down and brown. I also incorporated the bacon into the onion mixture and sprinkled shredded Swiss on top. I used delicious Walla Walla Sweet onions grown in my garden.

Easy to pull together with a quick crust and pre-cooked and diced bacon.  Very good and tastes just as good (if not better) the next day.  The only thing I changed was to use more eggs to fill my dish.

I had some leftover pie crust dough and thought I would use it for a small onion tart for dinner.  I used a pastry ring and it worked out perfectly.  This recipe makes a simple onion tart, nothing spectacular but still good.  I would add more seasoning to it in the future, perhaps  rosemary would give it that jazz that it needs.
