While the seasonings of garlic, olive oil and Parrmesan are not new to me, what I loved about this recipe was the cooking method.  I found it so much easier than other methods to control the degree of doneness and to assure you retain the asparagus' wonderful color. I don't know how well or how easily this would work with a large amount of asparagus, but for the small amount of this I used for Hubs and me this was a breeze.

This is a wonderfully simple way to saut√© asparagus!  I put in the garlic half-way through cooking so it wouldn't scorch.   My asparagus was done in about 7 minutes. Go off of color, not time.  When it is a beautiful dark green, it is done!

Made exactly as written, but shortened the cooking time due to my preference of having crunchier asparagus.  Great recipe for controlling the "doneness".  Make sure to get some good Parmesan! The stuff I bought was the best I could find in Japan and was passable, but I might omit it all together next time.  It's just not worth it if the quality of the cheese isn't any good.

This recipe was delicious!  My husband and I love asparagus and this gave us another reason to do so.  I think it taste best when you use thinner asparagus spears.  The thicker spears take longer to cook and the flavor isn't as good.

The asparagus was really good as prepared. However, when following the recipe the garlic just burns into a mess, so next time I will add it later in the cooking process.

This was delicious but had to change the way of preparing this as others did.  I put the garlic in the pan near the end because the frist time I tried this it burned and the dish was not so great.  Also, at the end I sprinkle the parmesean cheese directly on the Asparagus while still in the pan.  It adheres to the asparagus better.  Thanks submitter.

Easy to make and very tasty.  I agree that the skinnier spears cook better.

We love this, with or without the parmesan. My kids are super picky about vegetables but will eat this as often as I will make it. Thanks for an easy, no-fail recipe!

My family loved this recipe, the only thing I did do is cook it a bit longer.  It had a great taste. Will definitely make it again, it was very easy.

Easy, delicious recipe.  Any good olive oil will do though.  Next time I will add the garlic after I put the asparagus in as it seemed to brown quickly.

Excellent! Made with chicken picatta. Sauteed in olive oil for 4min. then added minced garlic for 6. When chicken was done I put the asparagus in that pan and cooked for 2 min. longer
