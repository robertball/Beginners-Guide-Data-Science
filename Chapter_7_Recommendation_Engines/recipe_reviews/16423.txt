Thanks DJ!

This was fantastic.  It was fresh and a perfectly light meal.  I was out of tomatoes but added green leaf lettuce and tossed with lemon and lime juice.  Placed into a whole wheat tortilla and topped with a little cheddar and diced avocado.  

Jicama was our new vegetable for the week and so we really appreciated such a great recipe!
