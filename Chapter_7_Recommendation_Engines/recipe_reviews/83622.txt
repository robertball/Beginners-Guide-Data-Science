Very tasty, though I felt like the tuna needed a sauce or something to serve with it. The flavors of the marinade didn't penetrate very far into the fish. Pay careful attention to cooking time, it will vary depending on if your tuna roast is round and fat or long and skinny and you don't want to overcook it.

30 Minutes? How about 4min per side. Cook Tuna to long and you'll lost all the flavor. It will be very red in the center, but that's OK. Just try it, you'll like it......Mikey did...
