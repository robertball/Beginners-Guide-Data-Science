I had some baby arugula and baby spinach on their last legs and since greens wilt down so much when cooked this recipe made quick use of both. Other than adding the baby spinach and omitting the red pepper flakes I made no other changes.  The addition of the portobello mushrooms, sherry and chicken broth contributed great flavor, resulting in a particularly special simple vegetable side dish.

Very tasty!  Normally, I soften onions several minutes prior to adding garlic which I would recommend for this recipe as well.  I topped this with goat cheese and ate it over penne pasta.  Yum but also just as tasty on its own!

This recipe wasn't bad.  It was good.  Though I love arugula like crazy, not so sure if I love it as much cooked.  I think I would have like it more if it were spinach instead, but of course this is a personal preference and not a reflection on cooked arugula.

This was so simple! So good!. I did not have any mushrooms so I just made it without, but did add spinach leaves. Also go easy on the onion, or heavy on the greens, as the leaves will cook way down and it'll be half onions / half greens. Was great as a quick lunch dish to get rid of a container of arugula and spinach I had in the fridge! thanks.

I wasn't sure about cooking arugula so I was happy to see this recipe.  I love arugula but am the only one eating it in my household so I often have a bit too much to consume while it's fresh.  Now I know I can easily saute it.  I've made it almost exactly to the recipe, using the suggested vegetable broth, and I've also altered it.  Here's a great alteration: instead of the sherry I added a tablespoon of Pernod.  I've also added extra veggies --- whatever is on hand.

Very good.  I tried it as written and have also varied it.  Instead of the sherry I added a tablespoon of pernod.  That was phenomenal.  I've also added it to an omelette.

Excellent! I like greens that are not grayish but I notice that a quick sautee sometimes is not enough.  The flavors together were wonderful.  I did finely dice the red pepper and onion.  Ratio of mushrooms to the other veg was twice their size. Paired it with hamburger steak.  It was wonderful.

This was good.  I was glad I added the red pepper flakes as some have suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks, Jumaha, for coming to my rescue.  Wanted to try a recipe for arugula that was sauteed and not raw in a salad.

This was amazing. I used dashi with water instead of chicken broth. This is so healthy and delicious.  Such a twist on greens. Better than anything you could get in a restaurant.

Delicious!  Didn't have all ingredients.  Used red wine for sherry, salted pasta liquid for broth, saut√©ed slivered carrots with onion, added al dente orecchietti pasta at end and topped with freshly grated parmigiano Reggiano.  Sorry for all the changes, but I cook with what I have.  The base recipe is wonderful!

I made this and used it as a topping for grilled portobello mushrooms that were marinated in a balsamic vinaigrette. It was good! I used the substitutions of white wine and vegetable broth because that is what I had on hand.

I really liked this. I've made it two times, because I get a huge quantity of arugula from my CSA. My changes: No spinach. No pepper flakes, or few. Used portobello pieces. Served over penne pasta as entre. It was earthy! Lots of mushroom and arugula recommended!

Works great as a solid side dish where you really want the main dish to shine.  The sherry adds a lovely note of luxury but overall just doesn't stand out.
