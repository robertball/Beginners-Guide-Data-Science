My 12 year old son had to cook for a school project and chose this recipe.  We used boneless chicken breasts and red peppers instead of green.  We used jarred peaches as the garnish--delicious, quick, and easy!!

This recipe needs some help because it doesn't specify when to add the peppers.  I just added them with the onions.  I also added a splash of soy sauce and lots of garlic powder.  With my changes I give this recipe 4 stars.  For extra flavor, cook your rice with chicken broth.

I actually made this and used red pepper flakes. The sweet and hot was a big hit.

Recipe was very good with the advice of adding some cayenne pepper.  Will probably make again. I don't know why people keep posting they don't know what to do with the green pepper. It says right in step 3 of the directions.

Step 3 clearly tells you to add the preserves, onion, lemon juice, ginger and "bell pepper" in medium bowl; stir until well combined.  Pour over chicken, cover, and simmer 25 to 35 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked.  Remove chicken from pan, keep warm.  
I am going to make this recipe and see what it tastes like.  It sound absolutely wonderful and soooooo easy.  Perhaps those who missed the instruction about the pepper don't know what a bell pepper is??  I will be happy to re rate this again once I make it.

4 stars cause the family ate it up. I am not so sweet teriyaki type :-) . I used homemade raspberry preserves and tofu instead of chicken.

Tasty! I used red peppers instead of green, since my family likes them better, and I think it went pretty well. I upped the ginger a bit but in the future I might add some cayenne pepper too, as others have suggested. My siblings liked it just fine, but my Dad and I agree it needs a bit more bite.

This recipe was good but a little bland.  It just needed a little something, so I sprinkled a little cayenne pepper into the sauce and gave it the "umpf" it needed.  With the cayenne pepper, I'd give it four stars.

Delicious! Didn't have peach so used apricot preserves - not sure much of a difference. Try using boneless thighs for faster prep. Could maybe use more sauce, because it was so good, kept adding it to rice and chicken. Enough for dinner, but could use more sauce for left-overs.

I added a small hot pepper to the sauce and it was delicious.
