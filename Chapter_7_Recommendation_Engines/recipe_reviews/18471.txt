Several commented that this was their first pecan pie, which caused me to realize I've made over 100 pecan pies! Here are a few tips:

- This recipe is the classic variety, which is really the best. Slight changes in the classic recipe include using white vs. brown sugar, using dark vs. light corn syrup, using 2 vs. 4 Tbsp. butter. All are good, personal taste determines your choice.

- Don't over beat the eggs; you don't want them frothy. Melt the butter in a measuring cup and then use the buttered cup to measure the corn syrup so it will all come out of the cup.

- This recipe fills a deep dish pan. If you use a shallow pan then a double recipe will make 3 pies.

- Mix the pecan in with the filling or put them in the pan before the filling. They float to the top. Mixing them in (rather than adding them on top) insures that they have a nice glaze on them.

- Extra pecans may seem like a great idea, but they can't all get to the top. 1-1/2 cups may be too much depending on your pan. If I'm making several pies at once, I cover the bottom of the pans with pecans and then pour the filling on top. I use a fork to flip them over to look pretty after they float up.

- Check to see if pie is done by shaking the pan - no jiggle and it's done. The depth determines how long it will need to bake.

UPDATE: I just made 12 pies in a morning. I put the pecans in each crust, then mixed a double recipe in my food processor and poured the filling on top of each. Easier method for lots of pies.

This recipe does need a deep dish pie shell, however, if you only have a regular pie shell only use:

2 eggs
2/3 cups of corn syrup
2/3 cups of brown sugar
2 tsp. of flour
1 1/2 tbsps. of butter
1 tsp. vanilla
1 cup of pecans

The recipe calculator doesn't do this calculation.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at pecan pie because it looked fairly simple...and it definitely was! I followed the recipe perfectly and only changed to a deep-dish pie crust, which worked out well. It baked for 55 minutes before I pulled it out of the oven because it looked done. (Hard to tell with this type of pie.) Then I served it to friends after it was cooled down to room temperature, and everyone loved it. Very sweet and a rich, creamy consistencey with a crunch - everything a pecan pie should be. Thanks for the simple recipe!

Great pie, especially for a first timer.  I live in the UK and used this for my first Thanksgiving..it was a great way to introduce my British friends to the holiday.  Very nutty--also very rich but not as overwhelming as some pecan pies.  It did take almost twice the given baking time, but I just left it in till the knife came clean as she said and it was fine.

Perfect 'as is,' no changes. My only advice concerns baking & prep. 1) Let eggs come to room temp. If you don't, the pie won't be done by the time specified, resulting in burnt crust & unset filling. 2) Toast the pecans in the oven until browned slightly, between 5-10 min after oven is preheated. It brings out their flavor & helps form a seal so they aren't mushy or hard to cut. 3) Using dark corn syrup, light corn syrup or Lyle's golden syrup (has maple flavoring) all net the same great results. However, in general, baking is a science & ingredients should be subbed carefully; guessing rarely works. 4) Bake on the bottom rack. This helps avoid a burnt crust, plus keep in mind that all ovens are different. I use 325 and cook until the middle no longer jiggles, checking at 40 and 50 min. I have another recipe that demands more pecans (wasteful), and I like a balance of filling & pecans. This recipe is a classic, and it's the only one I use.

OMG! This is the best and easiest pecan pie ever! It was the first one I ever made because I had heard it was difficult, but this one was terrific. Only change I made was putting pecans on the top. Oh, and I had to use a deep dish pie crust.

Tasted good, but I cooked it for 70 minutes and it still did not set up as it needed too. A little runny. I could have cooked it longer but my crust had had enough.

This was super easy!  I had never made a pecan pie before and everyone loved it so much, that I didn't even get a piece!  One tip, use a deep dish pie crust.

Didn't have any dark syrup, so I decided to try this recipe.  Easy to make and tasted great.  Used frozen pie crust and had filling left over.  Will make again when I don't have dark syrup.  Thanks.

Everyone raves about this pie! Many pecan pie recipes are far too sweet. This hits just the right note.   While traveling through San Saba, Tx, I picked up some of their famous pecans. They were perfect for this recipe. Remember to store your pecans at 35F or lower.  Instead of using a pre-made frozen pie shell, consider using of the refrigerated "roll-out" pie crusts. Much better then the frozen. Be sure to dust both sides with flour for best results.   When making the pie, one thing to be careful of is to not over-beat the eggs. If you do, you'll get an ugly crust on top. Also, instead of folding in the pecans, pour them evenly on the bottom of the empty pie shell, then pour the filling slowing on top. They will rise naturally to the top (if they don't, they're bad).  And instead of the toothpick test, just test it with a quality quick-read temperature probe. The interior should be at 200F when done.

This was a good and quick pecan pie. I used a deep dish pie shell and cut the corn syrup back.

This is a great recipe!  Very easy... I make pecan pie for my family every thanksgiving, I'm the only one who can seem to make it solidify in my family lol. A few suggestions... Make sure you melt the butter... The ones with the melted butter seemed to turn out the best. But don't worry if you don't melt it all the way, it will still turn out :) Also, baking times on pecan pies, from what I learned over time, will always vary... so, with that being said... throw some foil over WHEN YOU FIRST PUT IT IN... and leave it on! It will cook all the way and should be perfect in the end... set the timer to what this recipe calls for... but when the timer goes off, chances are it wont be done all the way... so, shake it to see if the center giggles... if it does, it's not done! Set your timer for 10 minutes and just keep checking on it every 10 minutes. It will be done when the very center giggles only a little bit (if even at all)... but leave that foil on! This recipe is AMAZING the way it is... those are just a few pecan pie baking techniques.

This is your classic pecan pie recipe. My husband's mother adds 1 tsp of lemon to her recipe. 
Hint: take some tin foil, cut a circle and place over pie so that it covers the outside entire edge of the crust - leave this on the pie while cooking and remove the last 10 minutes. This will keep your crust from burning!

I made a variation of this recipe: I cut out circles w/a cookie cutter, and put each one in a greased muffin tin, then scooped the filling into each one.  It made 12 pecan "tarts" and they are so cute, and taste great!
They popped easily out of the tin, and held together well.  I was surprised though, they still required almost 50 minutes to set completely.
Great recipe!

Very basic pecan pie recipe.  I made this for my ill grandmother and she loved it.  I made it one time with the store bought crust and made my own crust another time.  Results were excellent both times.  Mine did take about 25 minutes longer to cook, so watch the oven time closely.  Thanks!

This is the perfect classic pecan pie. My mother always used white sugar instead of brown and it is delicious! One thing I found out the hard way, do NOT use an off-brand corn syrup! I made two pies for a family gathering using a store brand corn syrup with everything else the same and they NEVER did set up!! I made two more using Karo and they turned out perfect. I will never use an off brand again. Hope this is the answer for those who say their pie did not set.

This is a very "full" recipe so you need a deep dish pie shell...which means it will probably take longer to set depending in your oven so you may want to consider foiling over your crust for the first 10 minutes or so to keep it from getting overly brown.  Aside from that...YUMMY!

I've made this particular recipe twice, and both times received rave reviews. It's the first pie to get eaten, and everyone usually wants seconds ((The second time I made this, I made 2 to cover all the "seconds"))  It's a delightfully classic pecan pie, and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is there just wasn't anything in the recipe to make it stand out against the hundreds of other pecan pie recipes out there.  That being said, this gets a solid four, bordering on five stars, and is an excellent recipe for both pie veterans and pie beginners alike. I recommend adding 1/8-1/4 t of almond extract into the crust, as it really does give an extra depth of flavor your guests will absolutely love.

This recipe is perfect the way it is. I cook it for 60 minutes. I do cover the crust with strips of foil when I put the pie in the oven to prevent the crust from overcooking. I've made this twice, and the next time I make it, I will cover the pie the last 10 minutes of cooking with foil because the pecans got a little more brown than I would like them. However, it tasted wonderful!

For those who say that their pie does not set up here is some advice. When adding the 1 cup of brown sugar do not pack it. I just made 2 pies, one my daughter tightly packed the brown sugar and the other I lightly packed it. Her pie is soupy and mine is perfect. Just a thought.

This was the first pecan pie I ever made. After looking over a ton of recipes I decided to go with this one. Oh, it was wonderful!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and had a hard time not eating the whole pie in one night! The brown sugar makes the difference to me! I have since made this pie 3 or 4 times and have gotten rave reviews from everyone who has tasted it, plus multiple requests for the recipe. Like others have said, you do need a deep dish pie shell.

Delish! Baked it with a Pilsbury pie crust and covered the edges with foil. Added a dash of salt and toasted the pecans. And baked on bottom rack. This was my first pie! Def. A keeper!

My first time making pecan pie and it came out excellent. I cut sugar by 1/3 and used reduced calorie corn syrup. Very easy and delicious!

Delicous. Have made it several times and always a big hit. Invited some friends to a Thanksgiving dessert gathering, husband said he would have to talk to the wife. Mentioned I was making this pie, and he said we'll be there, don't need to talk to her now. lol. This pie is a winner!

I have made this pie 6 times over the past 2 years and it has been a hit every time!  I have done the deep dish as well as dividing it into two regular pie shells and also used white sugar when I've not had brown.  I would say that everyone's ovens are different so watch it closely, I don't normally need to cook mine any longer than 50 mins. and letting it cool on the counter for a while and then sticking it in the fridge makes it perfect.  Family comes from 3 different states all demanding the pecan pie.  Since some of the family is from Kentucky, I have even added chocolate chips for the derby pie genre.  Thanks so much!

Made this for christmas lunch and it was the only dessert to be completly eaten. Everyone loved the rich toffee flavour. Note to those who do not have pre-made "pie crusts" available; make sure your pastry isn't too thin as you may get some filling soaking through and leaking out as I did. Totally my fault and not the recipe!

I made these for Thanksgiving, but since there was only 2 of us, I used the conversion for two and put them in the mini crusts. It was soooo good, and took only 20 min to cook. We had some extra, so I used it on top of a pumpkin pie. That was the best of both worlds!

Perfect!  We had just purchased a pecan pie from the local market's bakery section.  It is odd how they have a bakery section that says homemade, but the labels on their products list a hundred preservatives and unpronounceable ingredients....
so I found this recipe, and decided to try it.  Followed it perfectly, and the pie came out amazing!   

No additions, or alterations at all....  and it was awesome!

I can definitely see making changes and additions and what not, but not to make it better.  The base recipe is great, but if you want chocolate, or less sweet, more sweet etc, then this is a great place to start for any pecan pie lover.

Thanks for this, and good bye store bought!!!  This pie was way better than the store bought ones... and we thought those were really good before trying this, so go figure.

I made this over Thanksgiving for the in-laws (who were already biased to the MIL's version), and everyone loved it! I took another reviewer's advice and doubled the recipe to make 3 shallow pies (instead of deep dish). I mixed in the pecans, but I think I'll just add them to the bottom next time since it was hard to pour the mixture in three pies without one ending up with all the pecans!   Great pie! I'll definitely make again!

This is the perfect pecan pie. Just as good or better than the kind you get in stores or restaurants. I had a 9.5 inch pie dish, so I had to increase the recipe a tad, or it would've been way too thin. After reading another review, I learned that you can dump the pecans into the bottom of the crust before pouring in the filling, because hey! Pecans actually float. That helped! To make the pecan arrangement on top pretty, though, I sat them on top very neatly, and just pushed each one straight down into the mixture until it covered the pecan, and they floated right back up into place again. This is what gives them that sweet firm glaze that I absolutely love. Make sure the pie doesn't jiggle after baking- jiggling means its not done. The clean knife rule works well. Baked an extra 10-15 minutes longer for my slightly thicker pie. A huge hit at Christmas with my future in-laws. An impressive pie that's easier than it looks. Again- perfect recipe. :D

This was my first ever pecan pie and it  could not be easier to put together. If you're looking for pie that takes almost no time to make, with excellent flavor, this is it.  MAKE THESE ADJUSTMENTS: Be prepared to add 20 minutes to your baking time (mine was still soupy after 60 minutes) the filling should form a dome at the center of the pie. Cover the edges of the  crust with aluminum foil after 50 minutes. Other than that..perfect.

This was my first time making pecan pie, and it turned out well, but waiting for a knife to come out clean caused it to be overcooked. I should have followed the advice of the pie expert who said it's done when it doesn't jiggle anymore. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this tonight and it must have been the easiest pie I have ever made.  It came out very well.  Everyone loved it.  I placed the pecans on top of the pie rather than folding them into the batter for a more decorative presentation and served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

An excellent and delicious pie! I doubled the recipe and made two, and we gobbled them down. But the most bizarre thing happened to the pies--the bottom pie crust detached from the bottom of the pan and floated to the top of the goo, under the pecans, and baked there. It was an inside out pie! It was still really tasty, though (if difficult to remove from the pan once cool). It was just so strange... has anyone ever had this happen before?

This recipe makes one awesome pecan pie. My husband LOVES pecan pie and is very picky about how they taste. He took one bit and OOOOed and Ahhhed over it. He said it was better than his mom's!! I think she uses white sugar vs the brown sugar in this recipe.  Anyway, don't deviate from this recipe because it is perfect the way it is written!

Awesome pie as is!!  My parents' oven is a little wonky so after the first 50 minutes of baking, I put foil around the crust to prevent burning, kept baking and then accidentally left it in for 20 minutes too long. The trick is, although the knife will come out "clean", there will still be syrup on it. Anyway, the extra time ended up caramelizing the pecans (candied!) and the inner sweetness wasn't too gooey, which ended up being a bonus for everyone in my family. Good luck!

Made it for Thanksgiving and served with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla. Everybody loved it! Will probably try cane syrup next time vs corn syrup. It's a southern thang!

I also had to use deep dish crusts, but the pies were not done even in 60 minutes.  I had to leave them in for a lot longer, then the crust around the edge was overdone.  Not sure how to get around that...  The recipe was easy enough for a 15 year old to do it almost completely on her own, though! By the way, I read in another review that they put the pecans on top.  If you just add the pecans, they rise to the top on their own.

This was my very first pie I made and this was awesome!I made it one day before Thanksgiving but the family ate it all up before then! One little tip though: You might want to melt the butter before mixing all the ingredients together. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I had never made a pecan pie before- and since we just bought a house with a great tree, i decided to try. In the last 2 weeks I have made this pie reciepe 5 times. My husband LOVES it. I think you have to have a Y chromosome to LOVE pecan pie. It comes out perfect every time, and it doesn't taste as sweet as some of the store bought ones, so I actually enjoy eating this one! THANKS!

Maybe with one less egg this would have been okay. However, my pie was RIDICULOUSLY runny. I followed the recipe exactly as it said. After 60 minutes my crust was done and the pie was literally still liquid. This was supposed to be a birthday gift for my father. Oh well....guess he's getting a store bought pie.

I tried this recipe as my first time baking a pecan pie and the flavor was great. It was easy to put together and very little time. However, I didn't realized how much it still cooks when out of the oven so the top was a bit hard to cut through. I will try it again soon and not cook it so long. My son and husband loved it so it's a hit!

This was my first attempt at a baked pie - it turned out great!  I used a pre-made crust to start off with, helpful hint to butter/spray Pam on the pie pan before adding the floured pie dough (crust was hard to remove from pan).  Followed the directions and ingredients as stated and received compliments from all our guests on Thanksgiving!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe - we will be making this again, it was simple and delicious.

This was the best pecan pie I've ever eaten. I used white sugar because I didn't have brown and it was perfect. I also used the pie crust tips from this site and they helped me make a better crust.

This pie received rave reviews at Thanksgiving.  I did vary from it, in that I used half portions of light and dark corn syrup and half portions of light and dark brown sugar.  I used "real" brown eggs, that are always better.  I did mix together the melted butter (though I used Blue Bonnet) and flour before adding it to the mix.  Also, I added 1 TBS Captain Morgan's spiced rum.  Because I read that it requires a deep dish, I made the recipe, but divided it between two pie shells and added more pecans to make up needed volume.  I also used the "Spiced Pecan Crust" recipe found here.  Because of the two more shallow pies, I baked them for 40 minutes, and it was about perfect with my oven.  My husband says this is the best pecan pie he's ever had!

I have make this a  number of times and it is a big hit with the family.  I know a few reviewers have stated that a deep dish pan is needed, but for this Thanksgiving I made a double recipe and used 2 regular disposable 9" pie pans - We're traveling and I didn't want to worry about coming home with the pans - Everything fit perfectly.  I do suggest placing the disposable pan inside a regular pan before baking.  It makes it so much more sturdy with all at ingredients.  GREAT PIE!!

Super easy and super yummy! It cooked much faster than 55mins in my old gas oven.  First time I made this it way overdone, but the taste was still spot on.  Second time I made this I only cooked for 30-40mins and it was much yummier.  I used a store bought crust and it was still delicious! I will definitely continue to use this super easy recipe.

Made as written for Easter dinner and pie was delicious!! It did take a few extra minutes in the over to bake, was slightly jiggly after 55 minutes. Took about 65-70 minutes for me, but was worth the wait. Yummy!!!!

This was incredible.  My pie was deep dish so to fill it up more I layered shredded coconut and chocolate chips over the pecans, before pouring the syrup/egg mixture on top.  Barely made it until all my guests showed up.  Too many wanted seconds.

This recipe is different from the one I have been making--my Mom's recipe--for over 40 years with white sugar rather than brown.  It is easy and delicious and the amounts are exactly what our recipe is. I always use one of those pie crust shields to keep the outer crust from browning too much.

This was my first pecan pie and was sooo easy.  Everyone loved it.  I used a regular pie dish and it was perfect but I did have to put foil around the crust 1/2 way thru to prevent it from burning.  Will make this recipe again and again.

This is a wonderful pecan pie.  Tasted just like my mom used to make, and I'm glad that I found it because I couldn't find my mother's recipe. It filled a Pet-Ritz 9" deep dish pie shell perfectly with no overrun.  Very simple to make, with great results.  I liked the fact that it didn't call for dark corn syrup as many of the others do.  Will be keeping this one in my recipe box for future use.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I’ve been making this pie for seven years now. It’s a family favorite, and my in-laws always request it for Thanksgiving. My father-in-law even asks me to make it for him for his birthday! The only thing I change is making brown sugar pecans to go on the very top of the pie. I love how pecan dense this is, and I want to make it even more dense! I do about half a cup of brown sugar pecans as a layer on the top of the pie. They make a lovely candied taste to the pie and give it a chewy texture.

Super yummy pecan pie!  This was my first time making a pecan pie and I was surprised at how simple it was.  I used a store bought crust and should have read through all the reviews before baking, because it was really brown.  Next time I will cover the crust with foil during baking to help reduce browning.

I made this with the Pie Crust V on here. It was very good! My husband RAVED about it! My brother, who doesn't usually like dessert, said it was the best pecan pie he's ever tasted. So...I will say this is definitely a keeper! :)

I did this exactly as it was listed and it turned out great.  Extremely easy and fast for a last minute desert if you have a pie shell handy.

I just tried this recipe today and it is very tasty! I've not made pecan pie before and followed some other members' suggestions about melting the butter and using the same cup for the corn syrup and I lessened the amount of pecans just a bit. I baked it about 60 minutes, but I just used a regular crust instead of a deep dish crust. I will use a deep dish crust next time for a thicker pie. The flavor was very good and it's already half gone with only two people eating it so far. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is impossible to mess up. Tried it out today with a friend (it was our first time venturing into pecan pie making). We actually followed the recipe on the KARO light corn syrup bottle which IS this recipe except it says you can substitute margarine and doesnt specify using an unbaked crust. So we used I can't Believe It's Not Butter and a Nilla crust, don't think it was detrimental to the final product in the slightest. We couldnt even wait until it cooled, so delish!

Excellent.  I was having trouble with my pecan pies not setting.  I think the flour is the key.  I also used white sugar and dark corn syrup and it was PERFECT!

Great recipe! This was my first pecan pie and it tasted wonderful. I used brown sugar but light corn syrup so it had just the right sweetness and wasn't too heavy. I also made this without a crust because I am allergic to wheat and it still came out great - I just had to take it out of the oven a little early.

This was great. It was easy to make, although I substituted walnuts for the pecans. Kept everything else the same, though. It was a hit with everyone and I'll definitely make it again!

Awesome!  I love it.  I don't normally like pecan pie much but I loved this recipe.  So easy, too.  My husband commented that it was sweeter than he expected.  Maybe a dark Karo would be better for those who like it less sweet. For me, it was perfect just the way it was.

This was a mighty tasty pie. I used pecan halves--placed them in the shell, then poured the liquid over them. The top of the pie was almost like pralines and the inside was caramel-like. So easy to make, but the end result is very impressive.

I had a deep dish pie plate, so I followed the recipe by 1.5 times- I baked it about 70 minutes, until a knife inserted in the middle was clean - the results were fabulous. I took this to a Christmas party and received many raving reviews!

Very yummy!  Used the deep dish but had to cook it for about 70 minutes before the middle hardened.  Unfortunately, the crust was a bit overcooked but still tasted yummy!

This recipe was excellent,  Very easy to prepare and it tasted great.  It was not overly sweet as with some pecan pies, the true taste of pecans came through.  I did lay a piece of foil on the top and baked it an additional 15 minutes than stated because the pie crust was getting too brown and the filling wasn't setting.

It did take almost twice the given baking time. Had to stop cooking it because my pecans were starting to burn. Never did set. Has a good taste. Will not try this one again.

Wonderful and easy. I used light corn syrup, decreased the nuts to a heaping cup, increased the butter to 4 Tbsp, and added a splash of bourbon in place of the vanilla. This is a good base for English Walnut Pie and what can't be legally called Derby Pie (1/2 c chopped nuts and 1/2 c chocolate chips). It's a keeper. Thanks, Earthymom!

I use this recipe ever year for Thanksgiving! Because the recipe isn't clear, I usually use golden brown sugar and light corn syrup. This is the first year I'm trying it with a bit of dark corn syrup. We'll see how it turns out!

Also, in a pinch, I've gotten white sugar to work in replace of brown... but not as good!

I gave it four stars though, because I had to bake it for almost 30 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Also, on the sweet side... but I like sweet!

I made this for my family for pi day, everybody loved it. The edge got a little burnt, but it wasn't black or anything, just a little brown. The center got a little gooey, but it wasn't soggy. The 4 year old doesn't like nuts, so ate out the filling, and left the pecans :). The only other thing is that I only used 3/4 of a cup of corn syrup instead of 1. Everything else went perfectly, too! Recipe was amazing, thank you, EARTHYMOM.

I used dark brown sugar (that's all I had in the house) and it was fine. My biggest problem was that the gooey filling somehow wound up seeping between the crust and my pie plate. There weren't any holes or tears. I followed the directions on the pie crust box. So anyway, about a third of the crust was stuck to the plate and it didn't come out nicely. Also, even though it was done, the knife didn't come out clean. So it was misleading (I singed the first one) because I didn't think it was done. In spite of the crust fiasco, it tasted great. It wasn't sickly, saccharine sweet, which was great. I also added extra pecans. This was my first pie.

Oh WOW!  Loved it.  I made them into tarts (made with homemade pie crust) and baked them for 20 min.  Filled the tarts almost to the top with the filling.  Sooooo good!  Even put about a tbsp of chocolate chips into some of them for chocolate pecan tarts.  I would make these again in a heartbeat.

Still jiggly after 70 minutes, but pecans ended up burning... followed the recipe exactly. I will keep looking for the recipe I need.

My first time making pecan pie. This recipe was super easy. I did decrease the brown sugar to 3/4 of a cup. The crust overbaked since when I pulled it out of the oven and "jiggle tested" the center, it still was too wiggly. But otherwise, I got huge compliments on the the pie, everyone thought it was delicious and loved that it was not as sweet as most pecan pies, this has now become my go to recipe for a new Thanksgiving tradition.

Why oh why did i read this and make it?  Its all I want now!!  I did melt the butter in a glass bowl and use that bowl for the corn syrup, it seemed to get it all out.  I also used dark corn syrup so I used half dark brown and half white sugar.  This is soooo good and easy, thank you!!

I've made this pie a few times now, and it has been met with rave reviews.  Heed the other commenters; you really don't need as many pecans as the recipe calls for.  Also, don't overbake or the filling becomes brittle.

This was delicious!  I made it with crushed pecans instead of halves and poured it into mini muffin cups lined with pie crust.  Everyone loved the taste at my family gatherings.

This was very easy to make.  I had never had Pecan pie before and thought it was awful hard, but once we cut it up and ate it...it was quite tasty.  I also followed other reviews and put it in a deep dish pan, but then had to double the pie filling to make it fit...next time I will use a regular pie pan.

Not sure why the ratings are so high on this.  It says to cook until knife comes out clean, well that didn't happen until almost 2 hours of baking and then the pecans actually had a burnt taste to them.  I will not make this again.

I used this recipe over Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! Everyone loved the pie, but I thought that it did not have the buttery flavor that most pecan pies I have eaten have. Nest time I will do some research on other recipes to try to find a remedy. Also,  I followed others advice to pour the filling  in, then I laid the pecans on the top. I did have to keep turning them around in order to coat them thoroughly, so next time, I will do just as the recipe says and mix it all together, since the pecans float to the top by themselves anyway.

I really loved this recipe (even had people at Thanksgiving asking for the recipe).  Just the right balance of pecans and "gooey-ness".  Very good!

I decided to make this recipe for Thanksgiving.  It was my first attempt at pecan pie.  I never assumed it was difficult, I just never made it!  I did half light and half dark corn syrup.  Not sure what kind of a difference it made from the original.  It does have a nice "roasted" taste to it.  Do I think it's the best pecan pie I've had?  No.  But it's good, and very simple to make so you can whip it up for emergencies.  I also had to extend the baking time.  If I make this again, the one thing I'd change is to use 75% of the nuts chopped and 25% whole.  I used all whole and found a lot of excessive chewing was needed. :)

Though I've made many pies in my life, I had never made a pecan pie until this Thanksgiving.  This was DELICIOUS!  I wouldn't change a thing....though I did use half chopped pecans and half whole.  All in all it was absolutely perfect :)

So good!  Made this for Thanksgiving and it was gobbled up in no time.  I got many compliments on this pie.  I used a normal pie pan (just one of those cheap metal types) and the full recipe fit perfectly.  It was also very simple to make.  Will be making again and again!

This recipe really disappointed me.  I was hoping it would help me find the pecan pie recipe I'm addicted to from the store bought ones, but it wasn't the same recipe at all.  I cooked it for as long as it said to and when I cut into it, it was completely runny and not ready to eat at all.  So, I stuck it back in the oven until the pecans started turning black and the crust started to almost look burnt and it was still runny.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was really good, but not the ultimate. I've made many other pecan pie recipes and some were better. That is why it's a four star for me. Maybe a bit too sweet too. Thanks for sharing though!

This was great.  Make with light brown sugar and light corn syrup.  I did it with the dark one time and it turned out really bad. Good luck this is very easy though.

This is a really good Pecan Pie although I have to agree with one reader 1 1/2 cups of pecans is to much for me. I also tweaked the recipe a little bit I added 1 tablespoon of cream to the recipe .

Easy, delicious... perfect! I had to work on Christmas Day, but we needed a pie, so I gave these instructions to my bf (who doesn't cook...not even toast) by text message. He pulled it off and it came out perfectly! He was nervous about the task he'd been handed, but in the end he commented on the simplicity of the recipe. We made no changes to the recipe as written.

Best pecan pie ever!  I usually don't add brown sugar to my pecan pies.  I guess that is what makes this one so good.  It's a keeper!

I'm not sure where to start...  I've made MANY pies in my day.  The flavor of this one is incredible!  Unfortunately it just wouldn't set up...  We baked it for 30 minutes longer than the directions say. The top was DARK  and if felt set.  When we cut into it THE NEXT DAY it was all liquid.  Like I said, I tasted the top and it was delicious but I had to throw it out for fear that the eggy liquid would give someone salmonella.    Weird.

I've never made a pecan pie before, so I though I'd give this recipe a try, it was wonderful, everyone loved it, made it just how the recipe said , I couldn't have been happier, made it with a butter pie crust from this site, very rich but great, you'll only need a small piece, but very rewarding, if you like pecan pie try this one, you won't be disappointed.

WAY too easy to make. This recipe is why pie crusts come in 2-packs. It's a good thing pecans are expensive or this dessert might be too much of a staple.

I love this recipe. I cut back on the brown sugar a bit because I don't like it stick-to-my-teeth sweet. I've made it 3 times and will make it many more!

I made this as a Christmas present for my Dad.  I followed all the tips in the reviews, baked it for the time listed, and it wouldn't come out of the pie plate!!!  I used a glass pie plate, so don't know if that was the problem.  The filling tasted fine, but the crust is so stuck to the pie plate I'm not sure if it'll ever come out.  A real disappointment.

Had to bake an extra 20 minutes and the knife still didn't come out clean. We still ate it though and the taste was great. Make sure you use a very sharp knife to cut it as the pecans will mush down into the pie if you don't.

This recipe worked fine. All the other recipes I've used call for white sugar, and I'm not crazy about the brown sugar flavor in this recipe. But if you like brown sugar, you'll like this one.

This pie was wonderful.  I made it for my co-workers.  I used a deep dish pie crust and also has to cook it for an extra 12 min.  someone suggested that I add 2 tablespoons of flower next time.  Dont know if i'll try that, affraid it might change the flavor. I will post it if I try it and how it came out!

This was good after putting it in the fridge. What i did different was instead of brown sugar i used white.I didn't have enough pecans so I mixed it with walnuts. But this still wasn't as good as the professionals.

It came out surprisingly good for my first time ever making a pecan pie.  The cook time was a little difficult, as the crust and top pecans were slightly burnt in the time it took for the middle to cook through. I think I'm going to put some foil on the crust next time.

This was a very easy basic recipe. I did make a few modifications:  Substituted dark corn syrup, added additional 1/2  cup pecans,  1/4 cup bourbon, 1 extra egg. The result was excellent!  I’ll make it again for special occasions.

This pecan pie recipe is my favorite.  It is rich.  I make it in a 10 inch pie pan so the pie is not as thick and the top caramelizes better.  I also use a Phyllo dough crust but I don't think that affects the recipe.  I just like phyllo dough crust for the light crunch.

Agree that this is the classic "expected" Pecan Pie.
For fun and a slight change in flavor I substituted Almond Extract for the Vanilla this time around.

I made it sans flour and vanilla.
Pro tip: if you wrap the outside edge of the crust with foil halfway through, it will keep the crust golden without browning it too dark or making it way too crunchy.

My first pecan pie! Delicious! I used a deep dish pie crust, worked out perfectly. When I first took out of oven I was afraid it was too runny, but after a couple hours it set.  I put it in fridge overnight and this morning it was perfect!

A little too sweet, but it was EASY and good. Cook WAY LONGER than suggestion. I could it for 65 mins. and it was still a little under cooked. BUT, it's easy, quick and yummy!!

This pie was simple & amazing! I browned the pecans in the oven beforehand as suggested. I won't need to look for another pecan pie recipe!

My first pecan pie and it turned out great. It was really easy to make and took little effort. The cooking time was longer than the recipe stated but it wasn't a big deal. I will make this again!

I love pecan pie, and over the years I have tried many different recipes but none of them were quite right.  They all fell short of the "this is the perfect pecan pie" mark.  Finally!  I have found a recipe that is exactly what a pecan pie should be.   I made this for Christmas and after one bite my sister exclaimed, "This is the best pie you have ever made!" Love it!

I am personally still struggling with this pie, my first one came out with the top burned way before the middle solidified.  My second attempt (in a better oven) turned out a lot more edible but the middle still hadn't solidified quite right.  What I do like about this recipe is that it is very simple so it's a good starting point for my pecan pie making career.  After talking it over with more experienced pie makers I'm going to add more corn syrup and chop up the pecans next time to make it easier to eat with a fork

Five star taste, but I'm giving four stars for presentation. This turned out darker inside and out than anticipated--it looked burnt! But of the three pies I made yesterday, this was everyone's favorite.

Awesome.  I cooked two pies at once so it took a little longer to set.  Having foil over the edges of the crust helped so it didn't burn.  Will make again!!

My first time making pecan pie! :) The recipe's really easy and the taste is nice - found it a bit gooey though. like many have commented; the filling didn't fully set. i couldn't keep it in the oven longer as the pecans started to burn.

(tried this recipe again and realised that it doesn't turn gooey if you melt the butter first! :) the taste of this pie is delicious!)

Believe the hype!  I love pecan pie and made this for Thanksgiving this year.  It was a hit with everyone!  The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 dark and 1/2 light corn syrup.  Fantastic!

This pie was so good and really simple to make. Even my mother-in-law told me that it was as good if not better than her late sisters famous pecan pie. I did change the recipe just a hair. I added a pinch of salt which is always necessary when you bake and exchanged corn starch for flour. I also added three tablespoons of butter just to up the richness. Don't forget to add tin foil to the side of your crust to prevent burning, it's not mentioned in the recipe but it will burn.

I'm not a pecan pie fan, but my 18 yr. old daughter loves it and requested I make it for Thanksgiving!  AMAZING PIE!!!  So extremely easy and tasted great!  I did the corn syrup half dark / half light and that worked really well.  My sister makes pecan pie every year and my daughter said my pie was "way better" than hers.  I'll make this recipe a tradition for Thanksgiving since it was so easy and had a great flavor.

Tasted good, althought my browned up more than i would have liked.  Also, after a few days, the pie separated. All the corn syrup sat in a puddle in teh pie plate.

I don't eat pecan pie (I'm picky) but I made this for my husband's pecan loving family for Thanksgiving. I got compliments galore. They all loved it and I impressed them so I'm happy. It baked perfectly; it was a nice golden brown and the consistency was perfect. I will be making this again!

Made it just yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was great. I used half dark and half light syrup. I had to cook it at least 70 min and the middle was still a bit liquidy but it tasted great. I'd recommend cooking for about 50 min then if the middle still jiggles cover it with foil and continue to cook. Watch it so that your crust doesn't burn though and definately use a deep dish pie plate.

I added a 1/4 teaspoon salt to the egg sugar mixture which makes this pie not so sweet and brings out a slight caramel flavor-excellent!

I have never baked a pecan pie in my life, and I decided to suprise my wife by helping her get a head start on Thanksgiving baking. This pie was SO easy to make, and it tasted fantastic. My wife tried a piece and was very impressed. One thing I did was to break the pecans into smaller pieces. My mom has been bakingpecan pies for years, and always chips her pecans up. Thanks Earthymom for a great recipe. It's a keeper!!

This recipe was great. The only problem was my fault. I accidently put in to many pecans. Ha! 5/5

Very good and simple recipe.  One tip is to  melt 1/2 bag of baking caramel with 1 T. of butter and fold it into the mixture just before the pecans, or to layer the pecans on the bottom of the pie pan and then drizzle a generous amount of caramel syrup over them before adding the filling to the pan.  Gives the pie a nice, smooth texture, and also adds a great flavor!

Needs more depth.. I browned the butter,but that didnt do enough. Next time, I'll try no white sugar, brown instead, and add some molasses.

Very tasty! I didnt have pecans so i just sprinkled raisins to cover the top and it was delicious! After 55 minutes baking the fork was definitely not even close to coming out clean, the crust was perfect so i just took it out to cool and hoped it would set. After a couple hours on the counter it was perfectly set and ready to serve! Its heavy though, i think this pie filling might do better in tarts just because a slice of this pie is a bit of a doozy for the pancreas :)

I just made this pie last night. We had it today for our Thanksgiving dinner. WOW---everyone absolutely loved it. My husband said it sure was a keeper, and my brother-n-law said the same thing. I didnt change anything, i also baked it as the recipe said. I really do love this recipe. It will always be in my family and it didnt get to done and it wasnt to runny, it was just perfect.

I've never made pecan pie before but this one seemed incredibly easy.  I did have to add 20 minutes to the cooking time, and the knife didn't come out clean, but the crust was done so I took it out.  The insides were not as firm as I'd like but the taste was very good, not too sweet.
