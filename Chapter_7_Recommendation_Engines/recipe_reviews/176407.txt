These were yummy!  I used margarine instead of butter and chocolate chips instead of bittersweet chocolate.  The first time I formed the balls I wasn't paying attention to the candy pieces and found that quite a few of the cookies came out of the oven with melted candy along the edges.  When rolling the second batch I made sure the candy pieces were tucked in better and found that there was less oozing!  I'm so glad to have found such a delicious recipe that uses up all those extra candy canes the kids seem to collect at this time of year!  
Note: I always use parchment paper on my cookie sheets.  Maybe that's why I didn't have a problem with them getting stuck on the pan.

I was looking for a Christmas cookie for my cookie exchange.  I always like something that looks at least a little festive, which is part of the reason I liked the looks of these with peppermint pieces decorating the top. I practiced well ahead of time and I'm glad!  They turned out so much better the second time using a new silicon baking mat - something I had not used before!  They seemed to spread out a little more, really cooked evenly, and came off the mat easily.  I didn't even use a spatula!  I also did not need to coax them back into shape!  Also, and probably more important, I specifically arranged 3 or 4 larger broken pieces of candy cane on the top of each cookie, so the red showed.  The first time, the candy cane bits just blended into the chocolate.  This time, they are definately noticeable! If I remember, I'll let you know what the cookie exchange group thinks! I personally like this cookie alot!

i loved these cookies! i made them with my nephew's help for christmas to give away. i had a little trouble crushing the peppermint candies (i didn't have candy canes). i ended up making a big mess and broke my little chopper. anyway i loved the texture. they were chewy with a little crunch. i loved them and they were a hit with the kids. i only gave it 4 stars because some of the people i gave them to didn't like them. will do them for the holidays next year.

I make these every year, and always a big hit!  Don't forget to use a silicone pad for your pan, or you'll be throwing the pan out!

This cookie is my new favorite holiday treat! It is so yummy, my only suggestion is to let them col on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes then move them to your cooling tray so they won't stick!!!

Our family had all these candy canes and I wanted to use them up and so I tried out this recipe.  We now have a new addition to our Christmas cookie repertoire.  Everyone loved them.  Two bits of advice: 1)your cookies will be much nicer looking if you really cream the butter and sugar until very light and fluffy.  I also cooked these for only 9 minutes - when cooked for 10, the chocolate took on a bitter taste.  There cookies were really excellent and easy to make.  The kids loved smashing up the candy canes and breaking the chocolate into chunks.

I made these for Christmas this year - although I found Andes Candy peppermint baking chips at the store and used those instead of candy canes.  I tell you, what a hit these were!  Thanks for such a good recipe!

I followed the directions very carefully and these did not turn out well at all.  I ended up throwing out the dough after one cookie sheet.  I couldnt even get them off the greased cookie sheet.  Sorry, but I would not ever make these again.

these are really good. instead of chocolate chips though, i used 1 cup Andes mint chips and only 2 crushed candy canes.
There was only 30 cookies made though.

I will definitely be making these again!  Everyone loved them!  I used 'Special Dark' Cocoa Powder, so the cookies almost looked black when retrieving them from the oven.  Parchment prevented sticking, and I cooked one minute less than suggested.  I prefer my cookies chewy, not crunchy. These have become a permanent part of my Christmas cookie repertoire.

very easy to make and yummy.  If you don't have a silicone pad use parchment paper.  It works just as well. I also used the big pieces of candy canes to put on top of the cookies.

Delicious cookie!! Tastes like thin mint Girl Scout cookies but better. I substituted semi sweet chocolate chips for chocolate pieces. Since I was scared of sticking, I greased the cookie sheet with butter flavored Crisco & flipped dough over after smushing each ball. I also shortened the cooking time to 8 1/2 minutes and let them set on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Nothing stuck and they turned out perfect.

These cookies turned out too hard/chewy. You have to be very careful when biting in to them. I made them for a Christmas party but was worried about serving them so threw them away
