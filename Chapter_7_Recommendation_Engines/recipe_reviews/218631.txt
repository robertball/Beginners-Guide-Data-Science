I used this simple recipe as is. It certainly is easy and not bad for a throw together meal for the kids.

I made this as a quick chili sauce for chili dogs. Because I'm on a budget and because it was cheaper this week, I did use ground turkey. I also used a homemade taco seasoning mix. After tasting it, I did add more taco seasoning than the recipe asked for. Not a bad recipe, it worked well to make chili dogs.
