Horrible ratio! This recipe doesn't work. The ratio Chia seeds to liquid ratio should be 3:1! So by this recipe 1/2 Cup chia seeds or 8 table spoons should contain 2.6 cups of liquid. ((Sigh!)) I used most my remaining chia seeds on this recipe when I could have used half of the recommended amount. I also added cinnamon and vanilla to make it more interesting.

1 tsp - Nutmeg + 1 tsp - Ground Clove + 1 tsp - Cardamom - Those flavors are much to strong for 1 cup of milk.  I would reduce both of these ingredients to a pinch of each

This did not care for this.  I have been looking for recipes with nutmeg and this came up and immediately I knew the measurements were off.  1 tsp of cardamom is a lot because it is a potent spice.  Just like the others.  And when Iâ€™ve made chia pudding before I do 1 1/4 cup of almond milk and then 1/4 cup of chia seeds. I made this recipe like that with 1/4 tsp of both the cloves and cardamom and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and even then it was inedible.   Not sure how it could even be tweaked.

I have never tried chia seed pudding, and I'm not sure what to think of it yet. I cut down on the nutmeg and clove and added 1/2 t cinnamon. This was so super thick, it could barely be stirred after 30 minutes. I looked up some other chia pudding recipes, and they called for a higher ratio of milk to seeds. I ended up adding a whole cup more of milk, and it was still pretty thick. The servings definitely have to be off on this-- 1/2 c of chia seeds is way too much for 1 person. I got 4 servings with the added milk. I added blueberries to a serving, and it made an OK afternoon snack. I definitely couldn't eat a lot of this. I will probably add the rest of the mixture to some oatmeal and eat it that way. *I did end up adding this to oatmeal for 3 days in a row (which was good), and I still had to throw some of this away.

I made this basically as written but had my doubts about the quantities of the ingredients.  There didn't seem to be enough liquid for the amount of chia seeds, and when I used the written amount it came out very thick, like a jello consistency.  The type of milk isn't specified, so I used an unsweetened vanilla cashew milk to make it vegan and figuring that the vanilla would work well with this flavor profile.  Maybe using a fatty cow's milk blunts the flavors of the spices, but to me they were extremely overpowering and bitter.  These are all strong spices to begin with, and there's so much clove in this as to give that numbing feeling to the mouth that clove will do.  I tried to doctor it up by adding another 1/2-3/4 cup of milk and some maple syrup.  That helped, but still it's not something I would make again, and may still end up tossing out.  I could add more syrup or sugar to try saving it, but that defeats my goal to limit my sugar intake.
