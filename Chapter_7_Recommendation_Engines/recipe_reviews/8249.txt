This was a very easy recipe.  It was ready to go into the oven in seconds.

I did however, make a simple glaze (icing sugar and peach juice) and drizzled it over the slightly warm cake before serving!  It was delicious.  I will certainly be making this again.

This is one of our new favorite cake recipes!  We are big peach lovers, but since fresh good peaches are hard to find, I did use the canned sliced peaches (the large can), drained and cut the peach slices in two so the peaches would be in every bite (next time I will probably add another small can of peaches). I took advise from others and made a sauce to pour over the cake after a few minutes of cooling: 1 stk. butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 can evaporated milk and I also added a little vanilla flavoring and topped cake with a few pecan halves, which added a nice buttery moist flavor.  My cake was done in 45 minutes.  I always put a shallow cake pan with water in the lower shelf of the oven while the cake is baking.  It adds alot of moisture to the cake and was absolutely delicious.  My husband and I finished the cake off in two days!!!

I used 5 med. ripe peeled and sliced peaches for this wonderful recipe. I let it cool for 10 min. before I spooned a special butter sauce over the top. It was 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of canned milk, one cup of white sugar boiled for 3min. It sank down into the warm peach cake and was just out of this world good!!!
This is an absolute keeper of a recipe...

This was delicious, moist and not too sweet.  I did make some changes to the recipe.  I used only 1 1/4 cup sugar as suggested by others, I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil PLUS 1/4 c orange juice rather than the 1 cup oil called for in the recipe.  I also only used 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon as suggested by others and I used about 4 cups of peaches.

Be careful of cooking time-- mine was done in 35 minutes. Pretty good, but has too much cinnamon. I used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c peach juice, and 1 1/4 c sugar. Very easy, will try again with less cinnamon.

This cake is very good. Though I used 1 1/4 c. sugar and 1/2 c. oil and added an extra cup of peaches. Also toasted the pecans and added 1 c. of blueberries. It is such a moist and yummy cake. I passed it on to my mom and she is making it now. Thanks Barbara.

I made this cake into muffins and used apple sauce instead of oil.  I also left out the pecans.  The taste was great and so moist! Yum!

This was highly praised by my Bible study group, my family, and my husband's coworker.  Instead of adding a full cup of oil, though, I used 1/4 cup drained peach juice and 3/4 oil.  I also didn't have pecans on hand, so I used slivered almonds.  Finally, I topped the cake with cream cheeze frosting.  There's so much cinnamon in the cake, it almost tastes like carrot cake, especially with the cream chz. frosting on it.  It was gobbled up, though.  And, it was easy.

I thought this was a great cake!  Normally, I really don't care for "fruit" type cakes, but this was definately a hit with the adults and kids.  And with all the peaches we get each year, I am always looking for a way to utilize them.

I LOVE this cake. It smelled so good while cooking that I couldn't let it cool completely before slicing me a piece. Delicious! And the perfect use for peaches. I had a few that were almost overly ripe, so I searched this site looking for a way to use them and satisfy my sweet tooth as well. It almost tastes like a carrot cake, just without the carrots. And the peaches seem to caramelize in the batter as it cooks, bringing out the natural sweetness. If I could give you ten stars for this recipe, I would. The only thing I did differently, just because I like the butter flavor, is replace 1/2 of the vegetable oil with a stick of softened butter. I think a good low fat alternative would be to use applesauce in this recipe instead of butter, and I think it will work well with the peaches. The cake is super moist and the sweetness is perfectly balanced with the cinnamon and the peaches. Thanks so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

These are awesome as cupcakes!!  Followed the recipe, only substituting 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.  I used the full teaspoon of cinnamon and didn't think it was too much.
Will absolutely positively make again and will give as gifts!
Tip: when making as cupcakes leave 1/4 inch from the top of the paper cup and after filling paper cups, use a nonstick spray and coat the top of your pan so when you want to take them out the tops won't stick!  Oh, and the recipe made 20 slightly overfilled cupcakes. Baked for 40 minutes but ovens tend to vary...

I made this with a few alterations and it was fabulous.  I had a bag of frozen peaches from our tree in the freezer so I just used the whole bag - which was probably more like 3 cups.  They defrosted and were very mushy so rather than big chunks of peaches in the cake it was more like a puree.  So having more puree allowed me to cut back on some oil and it was still moist.  I added only 1/2 cup of oil.  I also cut the sugar back to 1 cup and 1/2 of the flour was whole wheat.  I ommitted the nuts also because my kids can't take food with nuts to school and I wanted them to have it for their snack.  The cake was moist and flavourful and everyone loved it.

Excellent cake, would make again and recommend it others.  I only had 3 fresh peaches so I also added a large can of peaches and it worked out fine, actually could of used even more peaches than that.  As others suggested I used alittle less oil and replaced with the peach juice from the canned peaches.  Cinnamon was perfect, could of used alittle less sugar but that just depends on your preference or severity of your sweet tooth!!  Overall it's a keeper!!

Oh mercy, this was good.  I left the skins on the peaches, rough chopped them into large chunks, and increased the measurement to 3 cups fresh.  I substituted walnuts for the pecans (since that's what I had on hand - a lovely pairing).  I made the glaze as others recommended (sugar, butter, and evaporated milk) but halved the stated amounts because I didn't want the glaze to overwhelm the cake.  The cake cooked fully in 40 minutes.  As soon as I took it out of the oven, I poked numerous holes in the top with a toothpick (then filled the holes with glaze in addition to covering the entire top with glaze).  Sweet, spicy, comforting, tasty.  Give it a try while peaches are in season, it's delicious

I made some changes to this recipe:  I used 5 eggs, added3/4 cup of flour, added 1/4 tsp. cardamom, added 1/2 cup peach yogurt, 1 tsp. vanilla paste, 1/2 tsp almond extract and left out the pecans.  I baked it in a 10" tube pan.  Lovely cake with great peach flavor.  Flavor WAS better the second and third days as previous reviewer noted.  I also made the Georgia Peach Pound cake on this site last month and I liked this one with my changes better, although my husband liked the other one better.  I also made a Orange Glaze II on this site on this cake. Lovely, soft peach flavor, great with vanilla ice cream.

I made a few changes and had excellent results. I used: 4 eggs, 1/2 cup very soft butter, 3/4 veg oil, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 c milk, subbed whole wheat flour for AP flour, added 1/2t cardamom and a dash of chinese five spice powder and fresh nutmeg. The result was a super moist, tender cake that was nicely spiced and needed no glaze or frosting.

This was excellent! I used 6 fresh peaches, and I made some of the adjustments that others had suggested - 1 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup oil + 1/4 cup orange juice. I also made a simple powdered sugar glaze to put on top after it had cooled. It was moist and delicious and best of all EASY!

One of the very best cakes I have ever eaten! It is so moist & sweet that it doesn't need a glaze. I used 3 cups of frozen peaches because that's what I have. I drained them, then replaced 1/4 cup of the oil with 1/4 cup of peach juice. It was done in 35 minutes.

Very tasty I drained canned peaches, reduced the sugar, cinnamon down to 1/2 teaspoon, and as another suggested 1/4 peach juice and 3/4 oil.  I topped the cake off with the recipe on this site "Vanilla Glaze".

This cake is very easy to make and it received good reviews from my colleagues at work. The only downside to the cake is the high fat content as a result of using 1 cup of oil. The cake is very moist already from the fresh peach slices and if I were to make this again I would cut the oil in half and perhaps add 1/4 cup of apple sauce in place of the 1/2 cup of oil. The cinnamon gives a nice flavor and with the crunchy top of the cake it's very tasty and appealing.

I had a basket of peaches that were not very nice.  Not wanting to waste them I decided to try this in a cake.  It was wonderful and moist!  So easy and tasty, I made another for a neighbour who is going through a tough time.  The only change I made was using brown sugar as we had run out of white.

Very easy recipe to prepare.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of peach juice and it still came out just fine.  I also put a light glaze on the cooled cake (powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and vanilla soy milk) and was very pleased. I will use this recipe again.

This cake is so good!!  I bought some peaches that were too tart for my taste but I didn't want to throw them out so I started looking for a recipe to use them for baking.  I wanted to find one that called for ingredients I had on hand.  I'm so glad I decided on this recipe - this cake turned out so good!  I used about 3 cups of peaches that I diced and substituted melted butter for the oil.  The resulting cake was moist and full of flavor.  Some reviews mentioned too much cinnamon but I thought it was perfect.  This recipe is definitely a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Had to tweak, of course, changed from oil to butter, lightened up on the cinnamon and used almonds instead of pecans.  Topped with Cream Cheese Frosting.  Would be nice if it lasted 24 servings, but hubby will wipe out in 4 or 5 nights...

Exceptional coffee cake! I too, as others did, added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla to cake batter and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cup. I used 3 cups of sliced, fresh peaches as there was not enough. Before placing in oven I added a streusel topping. It turned out wonderful and is by far the best coffee cake ever. Thank you Barbara. Everybody loved it.

Tasty cake- very easy and quick.  I used 4 fresh peaches to make up the 2 cups.  Two changes I will be making next time: less salt! I think 1/2-3/4 tsp would work.  Also a lower cooking temp.  I discovered halfway through cooking that the top was going to burn if I kept it at 375, so I lowered it to 350 around the 25 minutes mark. I will definitely be making this again with these adjustments.

Flavor is good, but I think it really needs to bake at 350 rather than 375.  I have a cookie-like crust on top (quite tasty, actually!) and a bit soggy underneath, even though it tested done at 40 minutes.  I'll try it again at the normal cake-baking temperature and see how it comes out.

This is a very delicious cake. It's moist but not too moist. If you like carrot cake you'll like this. It's got the same vibe. I put a crumb coat of buttercream frosting and when I served it put a dollop of homemade whipped cream and a slice of fresh peach. Highly praised by my family. Thank you for the recipe!

The cake turned out okay but we thought it was way too sweet.  I usually like to make something exactly like the recipe and modify according to our own preference/taste.  Next time, I will put only a half of the sugar and increase the amount of peach that is in it.  I also thought that I tasted more Cinnamon that I would have liked (I want to taste peach if I am making a peach cake), I would decrease the amount of cinnamon as well.

This was so good and a great way to use up an abundance of fresh peaches! I made the butter sauce to pour over the top (recipe in one of the previous reviews), cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 c., used half the oil, added 1 more cup of fresh peaches (3 cups total), added 1 cup fresh blueberries, 1 tsp vanilla, and I also toasted the pecans before stirring them into the batter.  It was delicious!!

This was quick easy but we didn't like it very much.  I used canned peaches instead of fresh--that might've been the problem.  Maybe I'll try the glaze mentioned in the previous reviews. If that doesn't help, I won't make it again.

Not what I had in mind. Not very "cake like".  More like a bannana bread made with peaches rather than bannana.  Not much peach  flavor either.  If you are going to try this recipe you may want to cut away the red part where the pit is attached so it will be prettier.

This recipe is incredibly awesome!!!!  I don't know why there would be any negative reviews here.  First time I made it, it was a HIT!  Followed the recipe entirely and added the glaze like it was suggested and it went in a matter of minutes!  I've made 3 in one week because our peach tree is overloaded and DH's work absolutely loves it!  Definitely a keeper!  Thank goodness cause we are loaded down with fresh peaches.

Quick, easy and SO good!  Probably used more like 3 cups of peaches and cut the slices into smaller pieces.  This doesn't need any topping at all except for some whipped cream.  I will make this one again for sure!

AWESOME!  I have a peach tree outside, doesnt do too great, but hate to waste what it does give us, so searched here for a recipe to use them up.  This recipe is terrific, I did take the other raters advice and cut the oil to 1/2 cup + 1/2 OJ (no pulp,) and I cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, I always add a tsp of almond flavoring to my cakes and muffins........Thanks for sharing your cake, A+++++

I made a few changes...I used 1/4 c of the syrup out of the peach can + 1/2 tsp baking soda instead of 1 of the eggs, and in mixing, i creamed the sugar with the liquids, then added the mixed dry ingredients to that. Also, i added some vanilla, because i am a fan, and baked it in four mini loaf pans. Pretty good, I might make it again!

I made this last night. Everyone really liked it.  I used almond extract instead of the vanilla in both the cake and glaze, which made it have a great flavor.  Also used more peaches.

Very moist cake! Not very peachy though. More of the spice comes through instead of the peaches. Heated up with some vanilla ice cream...yummmmm.

It is easy and simple to make, and it is sooooo delicious. I found it difficult to stop eating them. I made it for friends as gifts several times, and I got compliments each time.  I used whole wheat flour only. Used only 3/4 c of W. and B. sugar combined. Also, I only used 1/4 c veg. oil + 1/4 c juice or apple sauce. It is wondfully deliciouse and healthy, too.

great recipe.  i followed it to the letter with the exception of adding 1 additional cup of peaches..i used canned and it was still wonderful.  I also made a simple 3/4 c sugar and 1/4 cup milk glaze and put on it at the end.  Very very good and easy!

Wonderful!  The kids loved it, too!  I used overripe peaches I didn't want to waste and just chopped them into 1/2 inch pieces, skin and all and I sprinkled the pecans on top after I put the batter in the pan.  The cake was gone in a day~

I made individual cakes in a tex-muffin pan. They turned out perfect. I drizzled raspberry coulis sauce over the top of each and finished it with fresh whipped cream.

Try Kayelle's (her review and instructions on how to make the sauce is below) special butter sauce over top of this. I've been making this cake for months, but Kayelle's butter sauce makes it absolutely perfect.

Great and easy recipe for anyone to follow! I added 2 tb.spoons of lemon juice to the batter, because I was using tinned peaches (just to kill the extra sweetness);  and walnuts instead of pecan (since I didn't have pecan nuts). 
And I quickly made icing with icing sugar, butter and cream cheese. Delicious!

I made this cake exactly as written without any changes. As is I am only giving the cake 3 stars as I felt the cinnamon overpowered the taste of the peaches which is what I wanted. Why make a peach cake if there is little flavour of the peaches? I made a second one on the same day with my changes to compare them and I found my changes brought out the peach flavour I was looking for. I omitted the cinnamon and the pecans and I added 1 tsp almond extract. I would have added toasted slivered almonds had I had some on hand.

Very good, I've made this with apples as well and it's a very nice moist cake.  Easy to make but lots of working blanching, peeling and cutting peaches.  I guess you could use canned but fresh is always best.

This cake is absolutely wonderful.  We live in North Carolina, near the South Carolina border and have been getting South Carolina peaches all summer.  We've had pies, crisps and what have you.  My husband suggested a cake so I searched for a fresh peach cake and this came up.  I printed it and made it the next day.  WOW, what a cake.  My husband and I both love it.  I used the recipe as printed except for a few extra peaches.  I also baked it for the entire 50 minutes even though it appeared done in less time.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was good, but I don't think I would make it often. I do feel it needs a glaze, so I made one and it helped with the moisture of the cake. I think next time I will use more peach for the filling, because the amount I used didn't distribute evenly, which was about 3 fresh peaches. Next time I'll use canned or a couple more peaches. A good recipe, but not great.

This was pretty good, but I added about 3/4c more peaches and could not tell there were peaches in it at all. Maybe it was just the batch of peaches I had but they tasted peachy on their own lol Anyways, the cake was okay but wouldn't make it again.

I use a large can of peaches. I reduced oil to 1/2 Cup and used a 1/2 Cup of the peach juice. Other than that I followed the recipe. Some said that they thought there was too much cinnamon, but I thought it was perfect as written. It was phenomenal! Served with vanilla ice cream.

I also made some changes to recipe, substituted 1/4 c brown sugar for 1/4 c white sugar, added 1/4 t nutmeg, 1 t vanilla. Also made a glaze of 1 c powdered sugar, 1 t milk, 1 t vanilla and poured over cake when hot. Made a nice crunchy topping.

This is hands down one of the best cake recipes I've tried in a long time. One of the problems I have with cake is how overly sweet they can be. This is the perfect amount of sweetness. The fresh peaches, pecans and cinnamon are a perfect fit. It's a very easy recipe, and it took me next to no time to make. I baked this for my husband's grandmother who is hard to impress. You know she likes something when she asks for the recipe. It's that good!

Lovely cake- it tasted great the second day (as many cakes do) and was a great way to use up fresh peaches. Nothing extraordinary- but great for a late summer cake.

I made this recipe as cupcakes and they were adorable and easily the most delicious cupcakes I ever made. I added vanilla extract, and were I to make them again, I'd use an additional half teaspoon of baking powder along with the baking soda.

I also decreased the sugar to 1 cup. I used fresh chopped peaches - 3 cups and used 1/2 c oil, 1/4 cup orange juice and 1/4 cup peach juice. I like cinnamon so increased it to 2 teaspoons. When it was done, I poked holes with a toothpick throughout the cake (I baked it in a tube pan) and drizzled a mixture of 1 T melted butter and 1/4 cup Drambuie. It was wonderfully delicious once refrigerated.

I thought this was very good with cool whip on top. Imade a few changes by adding  1/2 cup of applesauce, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of oil based on other reviews. I only had 3 large peaches - one or two more would have been better. VERY EASY and quick

My family loved this cake.  After reading a few reviews I changed it a little.  I cut down on the sugar, used a little over one cup and used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce.  The cake was a great way to use up my fresh peaches.

A little too sweet. I was looking for something a little bit lighter and fluffier. This was more like a dense bread. It was still yummy warm out of the oven.

WONDERFUL!  I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 1 3/4.  I also used more peaches than called for. (6 fresh peaches)  I took others suggestion and made a glaze for the top.  I used 1 stick of unsalted butter, 3/4 cup of sugar and about 1/4 cup of peach schnapps, along with 1/2 can evaporated milk. Very moist, very yummy!

It was very good and moist. I added an extra cup of peaches so alittle more wet then I wanted but that was my fault. Next time I think I would only put in 1/2 the amount of cinnamon., but that is just preference. I will be making this again!!!

I got rave reviews for this cake at home and work. It was simple and yummy. I used peach juice and it was very moist, even after it was in the fridge over night. This will make it's way in my recipe book. Thanks

I also changed out oil with applesauce and only had to bake my muffins for 22 minutes.  I did however add about a tablespoon of canola oil on top of the cup of applesauce.

It was a big hit!  I used three cups of frozen chopped peaches and substituted 1/2 of the oil with orange juice.  I added a dash of nutmeg and the glaze.  I made two cakes and they were gone in less than two days.  I will make these again.

Very easy to make!   Just put everything into one bowl, mix, pour into pan and bake.  Do bake it for the full 50 minutes to be sure it is thoroughly baked.  The only thing I changed in this recipe was to to *not* peel the fresh peaches.  There was no need as the fiber will do everyone good, and there is less work to do in preparing this cake.

This was a fantastic recipe. I made a simple glaze by whisking milk and powder sugar which I drizzled over the top. The cake lasted four days with just three of  us eating it. It was better and better the longer it sat. The best pieces were on the last day! I will definitely make this again.

I can't get over how delicious this is! It's so moist & flavorful! The only change I made was adding 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and mixing the dry ingredients separately first. This cake is very unique and we absolutely loved it!

A moist cake, but even though I used 3 large fresh peaches instead of 2, I couldn't taste the peaches at all. it tasted more like a zucchini cake.

I added less sugar and it was still very sweet. That it was missing something not enough flavor. I agree with another person that it needs either a icing or caramel sauce.  Not that moist. I’ll probably look for a better recipe for my peaches.

I ate my sister-in-law's go at this recipie and it was heavenly. I made my own and one thing I did not plan for was exactly how much rising this dish would do in the oven. Definitely put the mixture into a baking dish/pan with AMPLE room for it to do its thing while cooking. It's very yummy though, with and without the pecans.

I added an additional 1/2 cup of peaches (just because) and my goodness, absolutely delicious.  This is a very easy recipe and yes I will make it again.  Very moist and I served it with a dollop of whipped cream. Yum.

Very nice quick snack cake. I'll use the larger amount of sugar next time-per the grand kids. The 1/2 cup of oil plus the juice is spot-on. Used two 14oz drained cans of peaches chopped a little, and the peach juice/10x glaze. The 50 minute cooking time is whack; 35 minutes was just that minute too long, but perfectly delicious. I'll do this again.

Yum, Yum, Yum! This cake is great! Because I didn't have enough oil, I used a bit of softened butter as well, and I left out the nuts. I used fresh, white peaches, which I diced into bite-sized pieces, and a bit of peach juice. This cake smelled amazing when it was in the oven.  I did spread a cream cheese frosting on top, as I'm taking it to a shelter (and cake just isn't cake without frosting!) The edges of this cake got a nice crispy texture, and the inside was very moist and flavorful. I will definitely be making this cake again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made it ALMOST exactly as the recipe but added about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg as well- I like the flavor it adds to peach dishes. Did not make an icing but made a whipped cream topping that we dolloped on top when served. Nice summer cake!

Everyone loved it !! I made it with my own fresh peaches. I would reduce the salt a little bit, just because it's fine out of the oven but after a day the salt is a tiny bit too strong. I used a little less baking powder and I beat the eggs a little longer than I thought I needed to, and it turned out perfectly fluffy, too. I used an easy recipe for glaze with powdered sugar, butter, vanilla, and some milk, and it made the PERFECT amount of sweetness for the cake, definitely not too sugary but still sweet.

Read many reviews,  I also made a runny icing with the peach juice and icing sugar, brushed it on when cake was still warm.Replaced some of the oil with applesauce. 
Put the chopped pecans on top of the cake instead of in the batter.Used parchement paper to replace the margarine or butter and flour.
Cooked it for 40 minutes at 375f. If I had left it in the 45 minutes it would have been overdone. Very good moist cake. Will make again for sure!!!

This recipe was so good and so easy! I used fresh peaches and the result was amazing! I added just a splash of vanilla. The kitchen  smelled so yummy while this was in the oven! I would love to make this recipe again!

I had way too many ripe peaches and this recipe seemed like a great way to use up some of them. Instead of a cake, I made 11 large cupcakes. Thanks to others suggestions, I used only 1 1/4 cup sugar (plenty sweet enough) and 1/2 cup oil. I used 1/4 cup OJ and extra peaches to make up the difference. I used peach juice and confectioners sugar for a light glaze after cupcakes had cooled a bit. These cupcakes were delicious and the extra cupcakes freeze great. Will definitely make again.

This is the best cake I have eaten and made. I did not have pecans so I used walnuts and fresh peaches. Followed the advice and made a cream sauce. It was so moist and delicious.

I made this recipe yesterday for a July 4th pool party.  It was the hit of the party and did not last long.  I drizzled the top with a peach glaze.  (Peach purée & powdered sugar). The only changes I did was increased the peaches to 2 3/4 cup and omitted the pecans.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Substitutions: I used a pinch of salt, 2 1/4 cup peaches, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup plain yogurt. Little dry, more like a bread. Not sure how to modify recipe...

Very delicious.  Read reviews and made some changes:  I decreased the oil to about 3/4 cup f and added a quarter cup of OJ.  Decreased cinnamon to 3/4 tsp (and that was definitely enough!) and decreased sugar to 1 1/4 Cup.  I used 4 fresh peaches which came to about 3 cups.  I made a vanilla glaze to go over the top.  SO delicious!  Easy to make, easy to change.  YUM.

I liked this.  I mixed the wet ingredients separately and then added the dry, followed by the peaches and pecans.  The temperature was too high at 375 and I turned it to 350 half way through.  Next time I will bake it at 350 degrees as it was too brown and a little dryer than it should be.  Thanks.  I'll make it again.

Will do once more with more fresh SC peaches, 3 cups peaches, slices cut in half. I forgot to read the reviews, so next time will use less oil. I don't care for cinnamon, used nutmeg, added 1/4 cup buttermilk and used my prune cake frosting poured while warm on warm cake.  Peach candy!

So easy, tasty, and old school- just what I wanted.
I used half oil and half butter, and walnuts. Just needed two peaches.
Another reader was right, and I thank her: 35 minutes was all it took to bake in a glass 9x13 pan.
I sprinkled the top with powdered sugar, cut it into squares and places them in individual cupcake papers. Great for a summer family luncheon for elderly relatives. Will remind them of the 50's.

I took Wilhelmina's suggestion and subbed applesauce for the oil; however, I did include the pecans. The recipe said to bake for 50 minutes, but I would suggest checking it after 40 minutes if you choose to sub applesauce for the oil.

Wonderful! Did replace some ingredients due to absence: coconut oil for vegetable, coconut sugar for white, and coconut flakes for pecans. Still came out great! Could do with more peaches though.

I had a large can of peaches I wanted to use, so searched a recipe and found this one.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated only I did not add nuts and I did not have 9X13 pans.   I instead used my larger loaf pan for half the batter and put the rest in mini loaf pans.  The two in the mini pans turned out great!  However, the one in the larger pan did not cook through out.  It was like raw batter in the middle.  I even returned it to the oven twice, cooking additional 20 minutes each time and still it was completely goopy inside!   I read someone else had this problem, but not sure how to remedy the situation.    Not sure I'd try it again.

I would give this a 3, but my BF (who doesn't care for sweets refused to let me bring the leftovers to work and ate the whole pan) would say 5.  I used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/4 c melted butter instead of the oil to cut calories and all the cinnamon becuause we love it.  Definately better the second day

I made this recipe for my boss' birthday but did not have enough quite enough peaches and had 1 1/2 cup peaches, plus 1 cup frozen blueberries.  Used 3/4 cup coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added 1/4 cup mixture of peach schnapps and brandy to the mix.  I actually used more than a tsp of cinnamon and was worried while it was baking when I started to read the comments about too much cinnamon. Well, I have to say, I was tempted to leave the cake at home and buy one for my boss as I wasn't sure how it would taste and took it in anyway.  All I did on top of the cake, was give it a light dusting of icing sugar.  My boss said it was the best cake he ever had!  I was shocked!  He had 3 pieces and took 2 home!  I also, poked a few holes in the cake after it cooled and added a shot of peach schnapps, not that it needed it, but maybe that's what made it so good! The only thing I would do differently, because I felt it was really good and the blueberries added way more pizzazz,  but just needed a little more kick!  So I am making it again tonight for my girl friends b-day and will add 1 tsp of almond extract as I think that is the zip it needs.  Will let you know how it turns out.

I give the cake 5 stars on my boss' critique and will rate it next by my judgement.

Great recipe and super super easy!

Definitely, a keeper!

This is a really great recipe.  As a young, single mom a few years ago, I had to watch my food allowance carefully.  This was then a great recipe for us, because my young daughters loved it, and with the exception of maybe a can of peaches, it has the basic ingredients in it you would find in most cupboards.  Very good, and a real economic treat!

Very good cake. I made mine into 2 8-inch round cakes and layered them with a butter cream frosting. I think it would have been better with no frosting to be honest. I will make this again!

This was so easy and delicious!! We served it with sour cream icing! Equal parts sour cream and powdered sugar! Perfect for summer birthdays! Also I used frozen peach slices that I had thawed.

This was very good and so simple to make.  My only small change was to reduce the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.

Great cake!  The only change I made, was halfing the cinnamon, and adding 1/2 tsp butter flavoring.  It was still a bit too cinnamon-y for my taste, but even though, it was worth it.  And so easy!!

I used whole wheat flour, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp almond extract and about 2 1/4 cup peaches chopped small.  Cake was EXCELLENT!  Very most and flavorful.

Baked this cake today and it is soooooo good.  The only things I changed was the amount of cinnamon from 1 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon and I used canned peaches.

I just made this!  I took it out of the oven and put a spoonful of cool whip on it. Yum!  The only change I made was adding only 1/2 cup of oil and substituting  the other 1/2 cup with applesauce.

It has been awhile since I've made this. People were pleased with it.  Wasn't a stand out nor have I had requests to make it again.  Here are my changes: 1 1/4 sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cin, 1/4 veg oil + 1/4 orange Sauce - 1 stick butter, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 can milk little vanilla. boil 3 mins. I do think it's worthing to make again though.  I'll give it another try when the occasion comes up.

Delicious and easy! I didn't have enough oil and substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce. I was worried the cake would be tough but it was still moist and light.

This is a great cake, I used 1 1/2 cup sugar and added almond extract instead of pecans, I also used a powder sugar glaze and added some almonds along with almond extract - it was great!

This was good! I added the sauce on the top as another reviewer suggested and it made it awfully sweet (but that's not how it was submitted so I'm not reviewing it based on that). Easy to make; I used fresh peaches and probably would add a few more next time. Thanks for the recipe, I will make this again.

Not what we expected at all!  It tasted like "sugar cake".  I followed other's suggestions and added more peaches (fresh from the farm).  We couldn't taste the peaches at all -- although is was very moist!  No one wanted to eat more than one slice -- ended up throwing the rest of the cake away.  SORRY...

Omg! This cake was the absolute best. My family raved about it for days; it was finished before the night was out. My family was forever reminding me and asking me to make the cake again. The one thing I did with the cake was follow a reviewers advice and added a glaze that consisted of milk, butter, and sugar. It made it a little too sugary for myself personally (not everyone in the family agreed); so i will try the cake without the glaze and I know it will be just right.

It came out alright, however I believe this to be my own fault. I tried to put extra juice instead of veggie oil like one poster suggested and it was okay. Will try again, hopefully will come out like the picture!

I made this a few weeks ago, and had to use canned peaches. I found it did not cook in the middle of the cake and was quite gooey. I left it in a bit longer but still didn't cook all the way, the bits that were cooked were great, but not sure I would try this again

So easy and so tasty! I made it with 70% whole wheat flour, and reduced the sugar to one full cup. It was done in 35 minutes, not 50. My husband and I are loving it! Thanks for the recipy!

This cake is great and would make an excellent muffin.  I baked for only 35 minutes and it was done - also decreased the sugar to only 1 and 1/2 cups and cinnamon to 1/2.  Still plenty sweet.  It may depend on how sweet your peaches are, though.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Took it to a cookout and received many compliments.  I used 2 peaches and 3 nectarines because that is what I had in the fridge and it turned out great.  Have made it twice and loved it.

YUM!! Hubby & son raved about this cake.  I used fresh peaches, and the boiled sugar/butter glaze given in a review.  I added a tsp. almond extract to that, but other than that followed recipe exact.  Will make again with apples, and maybe some fresh pears a neighbor gave me.
