i will make this again. I used a red wine vinager and fresh garlic instead. Tasted so good and meat melted in my mouth it fell apart in the sauce. I didn't have a problem with the sauce being thin,and my daughter and boyfriend ate it up and asked for it again

I made this as I was looking for some slow cooker recipes. At the end of cooking the sauce was very runny. The meat was very tender. The taste was not that great. I will not make this receipe again.

Very good flavor! Tasted a little like bbq beef. I used a thick cut top round London Broil and cut into slices. I browned the strips first, but i don't think it was necessary and probably won't next time I make it. I used rice vinegar and lite soy sauce. I added Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, onion, fresh minced garlic and gingerroot, and crushed red pepper flakes. Family liked it very much. I served it over jasmine rice with egg rolls on the side. I had no problems with runny sauce, in fact I wish it was a little saucier, but I did have alot of meat. The leftovers make tasty lunches! Easy, cheap, yummy, and makes alot-fits my menu plan!

This recipe is delicious, but a touch heavy. I reccomend lighter side dishes and small portions.

This was VERY salty.  It was hard to eat, the sauce became too runny for me as well.  I think the measurements are off as well, I used 1.7 lbs of round steak and it was more than plenty for the dish.  I just couldn't get over the saltiness, it completely overpowered the dish.  However, DB had 2 servings and that is why I am giving it 3 stars.

Very easy and very tasty.  I followed the recipe as is.  The whole family liked this, and I think the leftovers were even more flavorful than when served the first night.  Very good with just plain old steamed rice.  Will be a new easy work-night supper for us.

We love it! Reminds me of how my dads tomato beef tastes =D  Very much a comfort food.  I like to add snow peas in with mine and serve with cucumber salad (cold cucumbers soaked in soy sauce). Yum!

I thought this was a great dish! Very easy to put together,  Tasted yummy.  I'm not a big fan of vinegar in my cooking, so I didn't put quite the 1/3 cup it called for.  I would make this again.

I'm pretty easy to please and I must say that I did not care for this recipe. I would not make it again.
