The pork was wonderful but I did not care for the sauce and I used a good wine too.  Needed a bit of sweet.

This was delicious!  We had more blackberries in our garden than usual and looking to try new ways to use the berries.  The pork was tender and moist and the blackberry reduction was perfect with the pork.  I would reduce the amount of sage when I make again.  I found it a bit overpowering.  I also strained the reduction sauce before serving.  Our blackberries are fairly seedy.
Served with a selection of zucchini and yellow squash, green beans, carrots and sliced baby potatoes roasted in the oven with a bit of olive oil and pepper and it produced a company quality meal.

I had a lot of hope for this, but alas the flavor is lacking. I tried the sauce before I plated and was underwhelmed so I tried to jazz it up with a scrape of lemon zest and a pinch of sugar. Still lacked significant pizazz. Thanks for sharing.

Made this for my wife and she loved it.  Pork and Chicken both need a lot of help to keep them from being boring, and this was a hit.
