very good.  Brush the top with a little egg wash for a nice glazed look.

These didn't taste like the ones I had in Calabria many years ago, nor did they taste like the ones my mom used to make. The dough tasted more like sweet buns rather than a tarallo. Luckily, I made only a 1/4 of the recipe keeping the egg and yeast the same. When I told my mom how I was making them, she said in calabrese that this is the authentic and original way of making taralli "a l'antica". The exception is that the margarine was substituted with pig fat back in the day when my mom was growing up. But I must say that the technique still works like a charm! I really had fun making these. I just wish that they tasted a bit more like I remember. It's too bad my mom's recipe got lost of over the years. They were so good. My search still continues but these are worth trying at least once to get the feeling of authenticity. I just love the method. Thanks for sharing, IDAJ!
