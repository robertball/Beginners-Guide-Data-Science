This method of cooking may make you hesitant BUT it works every time !!!

The trick is DO NOT OPEN THAT OVEN DOOR TO PEAK AT YOUR ROAST - Tape it shut if necessary to stop your curosity... you will absolutely be 100% satisfied if you do this.

I also add rosemary to the rub mixture.  This method really does work every time!  You keep the roasting times the same no matter what size roast you use - the larger the roast is, the longer it will continue to cook during the time the oven is turned off. The second roasting time should be 30-40 minutes for rare; add 10-15 more minutes for medium or well.

We tried this recipe yesterday with a 2 1/2 lb rib roast! Fantasic!
Rubbed the roast down all over with olive oil, and then rubbed in McCormick's Grill Mates Monteral Steak  Seasonings (coarse salt,black pepper,red pepper,garlic and paprika)all over the roast and inbetween where we had the ribs cut. Tied entire roast back together  We cut the 1st cooking time down to 30 mins, waited about 2 hrs (the roast was 127 degrees) and then just turned the oven on for about 20 addl' minutes until the roast regisered 145 degrees-Perfect. Just remember NO PEEKING from the time the roast goes in, till it comes out! Smelled Wonderful and tasted even better! Thank You for this recipe, will now really enjoy fixing Rib Roasts no more guessing about the length of time it takes too cook!

A great recipe if none of your side dishes require baking.  5 stars for taste, but subtract a little for the inconvenience of having my oven out-of-commission all day.

I cooked it 45 minutes on the second baking as suggested by a previous reviewer that said the recipe as stated cooks a rare roast.  (thanks for that tip, btw)  Our 9-pounder was nicely medium-rare in the middle, with about two inches on either side of the middle medium-well. 

PS:  Forgot to mention, the butcher "boned and tied" the roast for me.  (They slice the meat off the bone, then tie it all back together.)  Much easier to carve this way.

This is the first prime rib that I have fixed and I too was hesitant when I read the recipe; but, it was awesome.  The hardest part of the recipe is NOT opening the oven door.  It tasted as good as it smelled while cooking.  The next time that I fix a rib roast I am going to put garlic in the roast and put a can of beef broth in the bottom of the pan, I had no au jus, only fat in the bottom of the pan.

We bought a 10.5 lb standing rib roast at Costco to serve for christmas.  We had 8 family members coming for dinner and we had already had our quota of ham and turkey.  After scouring the internet for prime rib cooking instructions I decided to go with this one because of the large amount of great reviews. The one thing I gleaned from all the advice was that a meat thermometer is crucial. I bought one that has the probe that stays in the meat while the meter stays outside so it can be watched.  I am so glad I did it this way.  I let the meat sit out for two hours prior to cooking and it was 50 degrees when put in the oven.  We like our meat med rare so I decided to use 125 as the max oven temp of the meat. I had read 120 for rare 125 for med rare and 135 for med. Beyond that why bother.  After 2 hours and 10 mins the roast was 125. I pulled it out of the oven and let it sit for 45 mins. It rose to 130 degrees. I turned the oven back on 30 mins (300 degrees) before serving.  The probe registered 130 when I cut the meat.  The outside was beautiful and the inside was perfect.  A little med on the ends and med rare in the middle.  Everyone loved it and sang my praises.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  My one piece of advice, use a meat thermometer because all ovens are different and most roasts cook a little different then the last one you cooked.

This is by far the BEST recipe I've ever used for rib roast!  It doesn't matter what size roast you have, just follow these cooking instructions.  I was very sceptical, but this was soooo tender and delicious.  I'll only cook rib roast this way in the future.  THANKS!

Perfect, absolutely perfect.  I also didn't feel comfortable with the style of cooking, but perfect.  I used the same times, did not open the oven for the entire 3 hours, but did add some potatoes upon reheating to 375.  They were perfectly cooked as well (quartered red potatoes with   caramelized onion and garlic). Used the salt and pepper measurements and added some Sint Maarten Guavaberry Blackening. Half the amount of the salt, a quarter of the pepper. Used a 4.16 lb. roast. Spectacular, the meat itself is delicious, just need to cook it right.  THIS IS THE WAY.

I respectfully disagree with MJG1940 who said with this method of preparing a prime rib it doesn't continue to cook once out of the oven because it doesn't have a bone. Think about it: Potatoes, cookies, cake, hardboiled eggs, pasta, casseroles, etc. all continue to cook once they are out of the oven/boiling water, and they don't have a bone. Not only does the roast continue to cook because of the internal heat, but as it cool a little the juices run slower and give a more juicy roast when it is carved. I never buy a prime rib with bones, it seems like a waste of money to me.  

BUT, this recipe needs to be adjusted for larger cuts of meat After you have baked it for one hour, let it set, then turned the oven back on, the recommend times for :.  3-5 lbs. 30-35; 6-7 lbs, 40-45; and 8-10 lbs, 50-60 minutes.  Be sure to let it sit for 10-15 minutes before carving it.  AND make sure you DON'T open the oven door during the entire process.  If you need an oven, remember, that is why God made Crock Pots, microwaves and electric fry pans!

As a first time prime rib roaster, I was a little nervous but this recipe was soooo easy and I had great results. However, the given preparation time should reflect the additional hour of pre-roasting rest.  Novice cooks may fail to allow enough total time.

I was so disappointed about ONE thing- I kept scrolling down reading review hoping someone would mention if rib roast is supposed to be cooked covered or uncovered. I could not find any clue, so I began cooking it covered, then went to another help site and found out you NEVER roast prime rib covered!! Arghhh! I had to open the oven to take off the cover halfway through the cooking process which defeated the whole "secret" to this recipe. It may be common sense to an experienced cook or to those who have done this before, but an ESSENTIAL piece of information to someone who is doing it for the first time ever! I don't know know if I ruined it...we'll see.

I changed my rating to a 5 star, because in spite of the little problem I had, the roast turned out SUPERB!! The only other changes I made was to rub it with Montreal Steak Seasoning, and it was so juicy and tasty! Keeper recipe!

This is an amazing recipe. I even hesitate to call it a recipe since it's more like alchemy or witchcraft on meat. I've never been pleased with my roasts, expecially this type. However, this is truly amazing. I had some questions about the method, etc, so I decided to record my experience carefully. Here's the amazing numbers. 6 lb. roast; inserted digital themometer at outset. Roasted uncovered on a rack in my roaster. It rested on the counter top for at least an hour before going into a well preheated oven. After 1 hr the internal temo. of the meat was 111 det F. Oven off: at 1hr,38 min temp was 127' 2hr,21min it was 135', at 4 hrs total time temp was 126' It sat for about 30min and then the oven back on at 375. I was amazed at how quickly the temp increased inside the meat. At 15 min it was back to 132'. At 33 min it was 147' and I took it out after 37min at 1509 degrees. It then sat for the better part of an hour. When I cut into it I was blown away. This is not your average cooking stuff. Somebody has spoken to the cow god. Thanks so much for sharing. Believe it, Do it, and enjoy certain applause

This is a wonderful Recipe. I added quite a bit more Garlic Powder on the top cap and put two cups of water in the bottom of the roaster to make Ajus. Two the water I add 1 Tsp of Kitchen Boquet browning sauce and about 5 drops of Wright's liquid smoke. This is how we cooked Prime Rib in our Restaurant for 35 years and always had rave reviews.

It DOES matter how large or most importantly how small the roast is when selecting your baking time.  I followed recipe EXACTLY and am now staring at a black, overcooked, dry rib roast. Terrible.

I've been usng this method for roasting prime rib for at least 25 years.  The recipe came from my mother.  For those who don't want to have their overn tied up for 4 or more hours, it isn't necessary to leave the roast in the oven for 3 hours prior mto turning on the oven again.  The trick is to roast for 1 hour at 375, turn off the oven,but don't open the door and turn on the oven at 375 for another 30 minutes prior to removing from the oven.  You do not have to wait 3 hours, the waiting time can bew as little as 1 hour.  The roast will turn out perfectly medium rare every time.

Made this roast for Christmas and it turned out perfectly medium-rare and delicious.  I did stud mine with garlic, which added something nice, I think.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  I, like many other members, was very skeptical about this recipe . . . and cooking this cut of meat in general.  I have never ever made a roast and was pretty worried about how to cook it.  After reading all the other rave reviews I decided I was going to give it a shot.  I was expecting 16 people for xmas dinner and it was my first year making it myself (so you can see why I was so worried).  I used a 9 pound cut of meat and followed the directions pretty much to a T except that I rubbed the spices all over the meat & let it sit over night before coooking it.  I was afraid that I or someone else would open the oven so I taped it shut.  At times I thought the roast might be cooking too much or not enough and again too much.  BUT, when I opened that oven door it revealed the most perfect rib roast I have ever laid eyes on.  And when we cut it open everyone oohed & awed!  Because the meat was 9 pounds I did keep it in the over for 45-50 minutes on the last cooking time rather than 30-40 and it came out perfectly.  This was the best prime rib I have ever had - put Cattleman's to shame.  I will definitely be making this again & again.  My whole family loved it.  I will never be afraid to cook that $80 cut of meat again - this recipe is truly fool proof.  Thank you for sharing!

I learned this foolproof method from a cooking instructor approximately 40 years ago.  It is the heated bones in the roast that continues the cooking when the oven is off.  Therefore this method will not work for a boneless rib roast.

The absolute best! Thank you! I used a ten pound roast and only had to add about 20 minutes to the final roasting time. It was THE best prime rib I've ever had, and the rest of the guest raved about it. It was cooked perfectly, light medium rare in the inside and medium towards the outer ends. Total perfection! Don't forget to let it rest when you take it out of the oven. THANKS!
12/16/10 Not really an update, I was just sitting in traffic for the last hour day dreaming about this prime rib! It was THAT good. I will never cook it any other way! FYI for those of you cooking a larger roast like I did, don't be afraid, follow it to a T, just add some time to the end. ENJOY. Here I am again brushing up on this recipe for tomorrow. I always like reread my own notes and others reviews. And if I read about Paula Dean one more time I'm afraid I will lose my appetite! Anyway cannot wait to make this tomorrow!!
12/3/17 Another ten pounder in the oven! First time in new oven so a tad nervous over here. Using the convection roast feature.  Already did the hour at 375. Door is closed tightly. Will be turning it back on in about an hour. ?? Fingers crossed!

I keep seeing people attribute this to Paula Deen, but my grandma cooked her roasts like this, and my mom did as well (and since I am in my 50s now I know its been around a while).  My grandma died before Paula Deen hit the airwaves, so when I see people who keep saying give credit where credit is due...should do just that.  2005? Seriously?  This recipe has been around for generations!!  This rib roast has NEVER failed to deliver.  If yours turned out tough, you did something wrong or you got a bad piece of meat!  I get up Christmas morning, take it out to let it reach room temp and we open presents.  Start the oven, rub it down with spices (the roast not the oven LOL!), and in it goes.  It cooks an hour while we play with our "stuff" and then I turn it off, and off we go to my parents.  When we get back, I pull it out and cook everything else.  Generally the potatoes go in the bottom of the pan in the drippings with onions and peppers, they roast and then I put the roast back in on top to finish it.  Rolls?  No problem, the roast is supposed to rest for 10 minutes anyways.  Easiest Christmas dinner ever!!

I have never had any trouble with roasting a prime rib roast. However, i will try this one out of curiosity for new years eve. I did note a few complaints about flavor. I am renowned for my prime rib and here is my easy seasoning trick. I first peel out an entire HEAD of garlic (2 heads if it's a large roast) I put the garlic and a handful of fresh parsley in my cuisinart and pulse adding olive oil to form a paste. I then spread the garlic paste all over the roast and then pack all sides with rock salt. Let the roast come to room temp and then roast according to the directions you like. Your house will smell like heaven, but if you don't like garlic hands, use disposable gloves to handle the garlic. I personally love the smell when I make it.I usually do a hotter quicker oven, but this is an interesting method that reminds me of how prime rib restaurants roast their meats. Ooh making me hungry!

Tried last night - AWESOME!  Left roast in oven 4 hours with oven off then reheated at 300 degrees F.  My friend gave me this recipe and she included the following...  After roast has been in oven for a few hours with the oven off cook according to instructions below. For Rare: 45 min @300 For Medium: 50 min @300 For Well Done: 55 min @ 300  I used an oven thermometer and removed the roast when the temperature reached 146 degrees.  Let roast cool at least 10 minutes before cutting.  For second cooking time, don't turn oven too high because the outside will cook too quickly.  I used an Eye of Round cut - excellent!

This recipe is awesome. I first tired it for Christmas and have made it up a couple of times since. I agree that if you are cooking more than a 5 lb piece of meat that you want to cook it for 45 minutes for the final heating. We've always done a boneless rib roast and it's yummy. There are a couple of things that I do differently that you might like to try. One is that I rub all sides of the meat with Montreal Steak Spice. I cook this on the roasting pan that comes with my oven which has a drip tray below it. In the drip tray combine 1 pkg of Lipton's Onion Soup mix, 1 bottle of beer, 16 oz of water and 1/2 lb of finely diced mushrooms. Place the meat over top on the rack and cook as directed. When the roast is finished pour this into a saucepan and heat to a boil - makes a lovely au jus. If I have vegetables to cook in the oven (like roast potatoes) I pop them in for the final 45 minutes of cooking and they turn out perfectly.

I am so glad everyone is enjoying this recipe as much as we do. We had it again for Christmas dinner yesterday and it was beyond PERFECT. As the "submitter" of this recipe, I just wanted to point out this is the way my mother had made rib roast for years and years, since I was young. A couple people have pointed out that this is Paula Dean's recipe. Totally lovin' Paula, but my mom was making this recipe long before Paula ever was known. E-N-J-O-Y.

This recipe and method are out of this world.
The only issues I have had with it are the starting temperature of my roast and the poor heat retention of my oven.
Both issues have been solved with the purchase of a Meat Thermometer which has a probe that remains in the roast inside the oven and connects to a remote read out outside the oven.
I have found that even after an hour sitting on the covered on the counter prior to roasting, my roast tend to be at a starting temperature of around 40 degrees (F) still to cold to start this process. Leaving the roast on the counter until it reaches 55 degrees (F) gives me better results and more even cooking.
Another tip, try cooking the entire roast to around 120 degrees which should rise during the rest period to around 130 degrees giving you a nice medium rare. Carve your Roast to serving sizes in the kitchen and then for those that desire less pink, broil their servings for a couple of minutes to reach medium or medium-well. Be careful and watch the broiling process closely this will go fast.
Try using some herbs like rosemary and thyme in your rub to add aromatics. If you plan to carve the roast at the table, make sure you read up on carving techniques as this is simple but takes some knowledge.
Then enjoy the meal and enjoy the praise that comes with this simple dish.

Excellent...this recipe saved me and I'm glad you shared it. For others info... my roast was boneless and 3.3 pounds. I cooked it at 375 for one hour and then 1 hr 45 minutes longer with the over off.  It was peeerfect!  Medium with a little pink in the center and medium on the outside.  Just thought I'd share for those with smaller roasts.  There was no need for a second 375 baking time.  When I took it out of the oven (which was cold after 1 hr 45 min) the temp ready 130 so it had cooked up to perfecton!  Love it ... easy... don't be intimidated!

I was a huge 'doubting Thomas' when I read this.  But this recipe really is fantastic! My roast was a bone in. I adjusted mine slightly. My roast was 4 1/4 lbs. I put it in at 375 degrees for 1 hour, turned off the oven and 2 hours and 15 min later turn the oven back on to 375 for 40 minutes.   The results were medium on the two end cuts and medium rare on inside. The flavor was spot on! I served it with a sour cream horse radish sauce with dill.

I have been using this recipe for 30 plus years.  The only thing I do differently is let the roast sit out all night so that the entire roast is at room temperature not just the outsides!  This is a very crucial stage!! I have never used a meat thermometer just this simple little guide for a medium to large roast cook additional 40 minutes at 375, for a small roast use same temp but only for 25 - 30 minutes.  I also put directly into roasting pan without a rack and it does not matter if it is boneless or bone in.  By letting your meat sit out overnight too come to room temperature you are curing/aging the beef.  This is how my grandparents did it and lots of other members of the Colorado Cattleman's Association.

This is a great way to cook a prime rib and I have used it for many years. For those who keep saying it is Paula Deen's recipe, I don't think so! Just because she cooks hers the same way doesn't make it "hers" any more than it is mine. Prime rib restaurants cook theirs this way too. It is a method not a recipe!

I bought an 8lb rib eye roast from Costco and was so worried I would mess it up. But after searching through numerous recipies I decided to try this one. It seemed that the most common denominator was to roast at as high a temperature as possible at 5-6 minutes per pound. Then to turn the oven off and let it roast for 2 1/2-3 hrs. I roasted mine at 500° for 40 minutes. 

Here are a few tips for success:

1) Purchase a thermometer that has the extendable  probe cable that will allow you to monitor the roast internal temperature without having to risk opening your oven door. After 2 1/2 hours passed my roast internal temperature went down to 122°. I turned my oven back on to 375° and in ten minutes it hit my desired temperature of 145°. My thermometer has as an alarm that goes off when it hits the set temperature. With this kind of thermoter you can ensure perfect results every time.

2) Under NO cirmcunstances should you  ever open the oven door during
 the 2 1/2-3 hrs. Again DON'T DARE OPEN THE DOOR! 

3) Tie your meat up for a professional presentation so the meat doesn't look unshapely. 

I can't emphasize the importance of having a thermometer with a probe. I read some comments on here that people roasted an over-cooked roast. The thermometer stuck in the beginning will take away the guess work about doneness and prevent this. I hope these tips help!

If you let the roast get to 145 degrees, it's going to be bordering on well done after the rest period (which is a catastrophe for USDA Prime beef in my humble opinion).  I recommend 130-135 degree internal temperature and everyone will be happy.  Having a good horseradish sauce on hand in conjunction with this never hurts!

My rib roast was compared to one of the best steak houses in the Region and I had no clue what I was doing!! Trust this recipe, I wish I took a picture... it even ‘looked’ perfect! I asked the butcher a few questions before I found this recipe... Some extra tips I learned (remember I had no clue!): get a meat thermometer (it takes the guessing out of it) and don’t forget to put it in at the start so you don’t open the oven! Place the bone side down, on a rack and keep the lid off. When carving cut along the bone 1st, then separate into individual bones pieces. Enjoy!

We were intially skeptical about this recipe, given the cooking method.  I did some further reading-the reviews and on the internet and the method made perfect sense for this cut of meat.  I HATE to rate a recipe when I have made changes to it, it's not fair to the poster...but I did very little to this.  I let the roast sit out for an hour before I rubbed on spices-I added blackening spice here.  I then let it sit another hour before cooking.  
I was preparing this roast in advance...so after the intitial three hour cooking time, I removed from the oven, let it sit, covered and refridgerated in it's original pan.  The next day, I set the roast out for an hour, and preheated the oven.  I also added one can of beef broth to the drippings in pan and baked it covered for about an hour to an hour and a half.  
It was perfect.  Given the change in cooking method I had to make, I was beautiful!!  I just had to say Thank You!  I will use the recipe AGAIN at New Years for sure.

I was worried after reading the on/off thing with the oven but after reading the raving reviews I thought I would try it. The only variation that I made was I put fresh garlic throughout the meat and let the rub sit on the meat overnight in the frig. Every other instruction I followed exactly.  For the first time in my marriage my husband said "That was bad"  It was dry and it had absolutely no flavor. I will not make this one again.

I too was very skeptical about this recipe.  I hated to think that I could ruin such a beautiful and expensive piece of meat! After telling my husband 800 times NOT to open the oven, I put my roast in the oven.  I followed the directions to a T and my roast was perfectly cooked for our family, medium on the outside, medium rare closer to the bone and rare in the center.  I must stress that bringing the roast to room temp and not peeking is the key to this recipes success.  While my roast was resting I added some Merlot and beef stock to the pan drippings and simmered them for a nice, rich jus.  Just seasoned it with a touch of fresh black pepper and sea salt.  I will use this recipe again! Thanks!!

If you want a good rub for this type of meat, of course salt and pepper but instead of garlic powder, us the real thing by making a rosemary and garlic puree and spreading it onto the roast.  take garlic and fresh rosemary, place it into any choppy machine not a drink blinder, and then add veg or olive oil to mix everything until its a puree, then rub all over roast.

what works for myself is to preheat oven to 500 degrees, place roast fat side up on a rack in roasting pan, roast fifteen minutes per RIB, than turn off oven, LEAVE OVEN DOOR CLOSED TILL OVEN IS COMPLETELY COOL. NO PEEKING! perfect medium rare every time!

I have used this lots of times and it always works well, but last Holiday we had a huge prime rib and it didn't work, it was still raw in the middle.  So it is OK for any average size roast.

I waited a long time to try to make a rib roast -  My husband and I have two completely different ways we like the meat cooked . . . him well done, and i like it med rare.  So, I was a little concerned on how to do make this.  It turned out great.  We made a small roast, 2.5 pounds.   I did the pre-cooking, let it rest in the oven for about 2 1/2 hours and then did the final cooking.  I split the roast in half, and put his half back in the oven for about 15 minutes and it was perfect.  I roasted some garlic and spread it around the roast.  It added a great flavor for the end.

This was a great way to cook a roast without any fuss while companies over.  I used a 4.5lb Prime Rib roast.  Followed cooking directions exactly up until the final cook.  I turned the oven back on to 375 and after 10 min.  I took the internal temp...it was 129 so I took it out.  After letting it rest for 15 min. I carved and served.  The roast was med throughout.  There was no ring of med-well to well done....just cooked evely througout!  I tend to like mine on the rare side, so next time I will probably cut the original time down to 45min.  Thanks for a great way to cook a roast!

This was ABSOLUTELY the best prime rib we have EVER had even in some of the very best of restaurants.  My husband is coming home from a long business trip tomorrow & I have a very special dinner planned with this Foolproof Rib Roast...he is going to LOVE it! Do as the recipe says & you can't go wrong!!

I am a total beginner, & was really apprehensive about the method and times. I didn't want to ruin such an expensive cut of beef. My roast was just under 3 pounds. 
I read another reviewer say the roast did NOT need to sit for so many hours so I did this:

I cooked @ 375 for 45 minutes
turned off heat & kept oven door shut for 1 hour
turned oven on to 375 for another 35 minutes.

This roast was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!  Tender, juicy, pink in the middle.

I will definitely make again!

I have to say that I was very skeptical about this recipe but I have to eat crow.  I used a 9 lb. roast and followed the ingredients to rub the roast but added rosemary and substituted some of the salt with seasoning salt.  I also placed 1 cup of beef broth at the bottom of the pan to use for the gravy.  I then placed it in the preheated oven at 375 and let it cook for exactly 1 hour.  Then I turned off the oven and let it sit for 3 hours.  The key to it is DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN!!!!  I then reheated the oven with the roast in it back to 375 and cooked it for another 45 minutes.  I then took it out and let it rest for 45 minutes.  IT WAS PERFECT!  Medium on the outer ends of the roast and medium rare in the middle.  People told me that it was the best they ever had.  Even better than restaurants.  This recipe is a keeper and I will do many more roasts!

I have done this method for years. It does work perfectly as long as you NEVER COVER prime rib and I do not know where  MJG1940 got that this will not work with a boneless but that is wrong info. It works perfectly with bone in or boneless and your best bet is to always use a meat thermometer. I use a digital that stays inserted throughout the process and thank goodness for my double ovens. BUT I do agree with someone else that you do not have to wait 3 hours but you do want at least 1 hour. I am making this again this Christmas. My husbands family are ranchers and raise Semitals so Beef is the way to go for us! I do add a couple of full bulbs of garlic with the tops cust off and a little olive oil and sea salt on top of the cut side to roast along with and when done I use it to squeeze out into mashed potatoes. (if worried that the garlic will be too done just put them in foil with them slightly open at top.)

Just sat down from cleaning up after our outstanding feast!  I've made prime rib before, always struggling to not overcook and ruin such an expensive cut of meat.  This recipe has solved that problem.  I followed the cooking instructions to the letter and produced a perfectly cooked, medium rare, tender prime rib.  My family & guests raved over it and declared it the best they've ever had, and that's saying a lot!  I do like a little more of a rub on the outside, so I used about 4 tablespoons or so of Better Than Bouillon Beef base, a couple tablespoons each of granulated garlic and onion powder and enough oilve oil to make a spreadable paste, covering the outside of the prime rib before cooking.  I also made an au jus by sautéing a quartered onion in oilive oil till carmelized and adding beef base and water to taste.

I bet this would have been a great recipe.  I used a 2.5 pound roast and took another rater seriously when they said that all roasts should be cooked the same amount of time, regardless of size.  That sure didn't work out for me.  The roast was well-done.  It was still pretty tender for well-done, but was not the medium rare I had hoped.  Next time I will cut the cooking time down to 30 minutes for a small roast.

So disappointed.  I'm sorry, but this was the toughest roast I've ever made.  Talk about shoe leather. It could have been my cut of meat, but I'm suggesting some type of overnight pre-seasoning or tenderizing method first.  Ended up having to make a quick frozen meal to serve, this was so dry and tough. Wondering if my convection oven had anything to do with the outcome?  Any ideas?  So sorry, I never want to give anyone a poor rating.

My first two rib roasts were disasters (one over-cooked and one under-cooked and I used a meat thermometer on both of them). I decided to give this recipe a shot and it was a home run(with-out a thermometer). Several of my friends now use this recipe and swear by it.

This is the exact recipe I've used for several years and it's always perfect.  The only thing I would add is that I always ask the butcher to cut the meat off the bone and then set it back on the bone to cook.  So easy, then to serve.

This does not work for all roasts. Mine was quite small and hardly any fat on it. I halfed the cooking time and the roast was still very dry and overcooked. I believe you need to have a larger roast with some fat on it, in order for the roast to stay moist. I may try again with a different piece of meat, but with the smaller lean piece I used today, it wasn't that great.

This did not work out for me AT ALL.  I took a leap of faith and followed the directions to a T, even though I was super nervous.  The only thing I did differently was turn the heat to 400 both ends of cooking rather than 375 (again, was nervous!).  My roast was so horribly RAW (not even rare) in the middle that there was no way I could serve it ... I put it back into the oven for another 40 minutes .... STILL way too rare (and don't get me wrong, I like a good rare piece of Prime Rib!).  Dinner was 2 hours late! :(  Plus, even once I did get it cooked enough, it was bland.  I was so bummed -- that meat was super expensive and I was not happy that this is what I served to my guests at Christmas! :(

Bought a 10 lb. rib roast. Followed the directions, but rubbed it with Montreal Steak seasoning, and decided to cook it a bit longer since I'm more on the medium well side. The 16 people I served for dinner were quite impressed. It turned out perfectly.

Follow the recipe exactly. Check the temperature with an instant read thermometer after 30 minutes, then decide whether to add extra time. A smaller roast (under 3 lbs)will cook faster due to it being a thinner cut, but the larger ones are all about the same. They just get longer, not substantially thicker. Mine was 7 lbs and just perfectly done for medium rare. Just splurge and buy a bigger roast, the leftovers are awesome!

Well before I begin I want to say that the roast was good, but way too stressful.  FIRST - everyone says "Do not open the oven" under no circumstances, BUT no one says what will happen if you do.  The reviews, the receipes, nobody says what dreadful thing will befall you should you open the oven.  I have cooked rib roasts before and never had a problem.  I saw all the rave reviews, I even checked out Paula Deans site (someone mentioned it was there as well and it was) and thought this will be easy. There were hundreds of positive reviews.  I have a three year old oven it works perfect.  I bought a 4.75lb roast and followed all instructions to a tee.  My husband and I both worked on this...  Prepared, cooked it for a hour, turned it off after a hour, we had a meat themometer in place and 1.5 hr into the 3 hour window of "no opening" our meat was at 140 degrees (internal) So now I am freaking out as I have no idea what another 1.5 hrs will do let alone heating it up and cooking it again. So we took a chance and opened it to make sure our placement of the themometer was good, we then saw it was, and we decide to give it another hour and then we took it out of the oven (yes we opened and took it out) and heated the oven up and placed it back in and cooked it another 20 minutes.  It was fine, tastes like a rib roast should, it was medium on outside and med rare inside.  I can't see me doing this again and stressing out about ruining a $40.00 piece of meat.  I know the majority of

I am quite experienced in the kitchen, and have roasted many a prime rib.  When this recipe crossed my path, I thought "Fool Proof?  WOW!  Who couldn't use foolproof?"  So, I gave it a whirl.  I followed your instructions to a "T," except my rib roast was almost 7 lbs., so on the reheating, when it reached 128 degrees, I took it out to rest, thinking that most of my family prefers med-rare.  This rib roast was over-cooked & dried out.  It was by far, the TOUGHEST prime rib I have EVER cooked in my 27 years as a wife & mother.  I would NEVER recommend this method to anyone.

This is exactly the same recipe I received from a US Navy mess cook as to how they cook beef roasts for the sailors on board ships. It works perfectly no matter what cut of beef you have...eye round, standing rib, etc. I've even tossed in a frozen eye round early in the AM, followed the 375º directions for 1 hour and left it in the oven untouched for the whole day and when we're ready for dinner, reheated for 15 minutes and the roast was done to perfection. I would guess that if your oven temps are awry, a temperature gauge would be helpful...

The high-ratings on this recipe are more for the cooking technique than the actual 4 ingredients.  You can play with the spice mix however you want - I doubled the garlic powder and added Montreal Steak seasoning and rosemary.    It came out absolutely perfectly.  I made this for my Mom on Mother's Day and like some others, I was apprehensive about leaving it in the oven all afternoon, but it worked perfectly.  My mom and my husband said it was the best prime rib ever. Thanks!

I have been making my rib roast this way for years, but I do season it differently.  I use dry chicken bullion (yes chicken NOT BEEF) and garlic powder mixed together and rub the entire roast with it.  I also stud with garlic for added garlic.  I used to work as a meat wrapper in a local grocery store and gave this recipe out to people who wanted something different.  They all came back and raved.

OH MY GOD! I was not sure about trying this but gave in and boy am I glad I did. I rubbed the roast with oil then rubbed on crushed garlic then the spices along with some rosemary, This is by far the best prime rib I have made and to my delight my husband said it was awsome and was actually better then our favorite place we go out to eat at. I will no longer use any other recipe for prime rib. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

I've made it this way 3 times now and it has turned out perfect every time, except I only cook it until the thermometer reaches 130 degrees. I make twice stuffed potatoes to go with this because I only have one oven, I make the potatoes ahead of time and refrigerate until the last 40 minutes then put them in the last 40 minutes with the prime rib.

This Paula Deen recipe has been around for many years.  I've made it probably 30 times.  Every year our RV club expects me to make this for 20+ people.  I've successfully made it in a tiny RV oven, portable convection oven, an old RV park stove, and of course in my home oven.  Always get great, perfect results.  Just don't add too much broth/wine in the pan or it will steam not roast.

I made this tonight for company and everybody loved it!  I did have to cook it longer the second time the oven is on because we like our roasts medium, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

I have never prepared prime rib.  After reading all the 5 star ratings, I had the confidence to try it out for a Xmas dinner I was hosting.  FABULOUS!!!  All guests are food snobs so it's always a challenge preparing something that will impress.  THIS DID IT!!  A keeper!  Thanks AR.

I made some changes of my own with this recipe.  I seasoned it over night with some seasoned salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, rosemary and sage.  Then I preheated the oven to 500 degrees F before I put the roast in.  I lowered it to 375 after that and followed the directions as says here.  It came out perfect.  My family wanted seconds and thirds.  Made my day. Thanks Salsiepie

This is a five star recipe without a doubt!  If you like your beef a bit more rare, reduce the time sitting in the oven to 2 hrs, 30 minutes, then reheat at 375 degrees for 10-15 minutes.  Internal temperature should read 125-135 degrees.  Serve with au jus.

Very good and easy recipe. Ours was cooked a little too much but I'm pretty sure that was my fault. I took the roast out of the oven after the 3 hours (might have been more like 4) and preheated it again before putting the roast back in. I think if I had left the roast in the oven and just turned the oven back on and started timing it then, it would have been medium rare. As it was, it turned out juicy and flavorful - just a little past where I'd like it cooked.

Amazing!  Had a 6 pound prime rib in the freezer waiting for this recipe.  Let it thaw completely overnight before cooking as directed.  We like our meat rare so after the 3 hour rest, cooked it at 375 for about 30 minutes till internal temp. was 130 - tented out of oven for 15 minutes before serving.  Garlic mashed, green beans, ummmmm.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome roast. Really simple, yet tasty. I loike my meat to be well-done, I can't stand the bloody juice at the center of the meat, so I left in the oven an extra 45 minutes and it came out great!

This turned out, not so great-to say the least! did EXACTLY as the recipe stated and it didnt cook all the way, or well, lets say that the ends over cooked and the center barely cooked. The ends where it over cooked tasted great and the center was RAW. I was expecting a medium rare rib roast but instead my dogs got dinner. I will not be cooking this again, and what a shame too, because I was I looking forward to it:/

followed exactly and was not pleased... was well on outside and blood rare on inside...and no, I did not open the door. And I let it come to room temp for 3 hours so I know it wasn't because it was cold inside... Used an electric oven,, don;t know if that had anything to do with it.

I will never ever use any other recipe for prime rip!  You can change the seasonings, but prime rib roast is the king so don't mess with it!  If there were more stars available, I would have chosen them as well.

I have made prime rib several times and although I have always had great success with it, this recipe intrigued me and I had to give it a try for Christmas Eve dinner...I was so glad I did!  I followed the cooking instructions to a "T", but I seasoned it differently.  I spiked the meat with cloves of garlic, coated the roast with a mixture of salt, pepper and garlic powder, tucked several stems of fresh rosemary under the twine and then drizzled with olive oil.  It was fabulous!  I added sliced onion and sliced mushrooms (button & baby bella) to the pan during the reheat step and then when I removed the meat, I added a package of Au Jus mix, port wine and water to the pan to make an amazing gravy!  We even got two additional meals of out of the meat...1) sliced the meat and reheated in the onion/mushroom gravy to serve with mashed potatoes and veggies....2) sliced and reheated in a fresh-made Au Jus and served on buttered and grilled chiabatta rolls with Au Jus and horseradish sauce and served with Trader Joe's Garlic Fries and fresh veggie.  Great recipe...I will make it this way all the time!

Awesome! I used this reciped with a 15lb roast on Christmas day! I was very skeptical as was my mother-in-law but sure enough this was fantastic! I did rub with olive oil and Montreal Steak Seasoning and a can of beef broth in the bottom of the pan. I also let roast sit on counter for about 30 mins covered in foil after taking out of the oven.

I was given this recipe from the family of a butcher.  It's true!  Absolutely the best way to cook prime rib roast.  For a very small roast the cooking time does need to be shortened a bit.  But for the most part the same method works for all roasts.

It was okay but came out way too overcooked.  I think my oven is actually too well insulated.  If anyone knows of a way of predicting the internal temperature based on roasting times and waiting times that would be helpful.

I leave out the powdered garlic and poke fresh garlic into the fat before roasting. The chunks of roasted garlic makes for an amazing roast! I serve it with a creamy horseradish sauce, homemade au jus and cabernet wine jelly.

I was a little concerned about turning off the oven and letting it cook without the actual heat on, and I didn't peek either. Surprise! It was cooked perfect.  My husband and I did one the year before on the grill and he said this tasted 100% better and this way allowed us to do other things while it "cooked itself".  We have done this 3 times and are never let down!

For those of you leaving bad ratings because you claim it is Paula Deens recipe...get your facts straight! This recipe is NOT trademarked by Paula Deen and if you look at other websites you will find that this very recipe has been posted by many people on different sites...so who knows, maybe Paula Deen got her recipe from someone else's site? Maybe even from our very own SALSIEPIE? What matters here is SALSIEPIE posted this recipe on allrecipes.com and I for one am very grateful she did!

I've used this recipe many times and each time it comes out perfect! I've got mine in the oven right now and my house smells fantastic!! Cant wait to serve my family this tried and true recipe!

Perfect! I used a 3.8 lb roast and cut the initial cooking time down to 40 minutes. Waited 2 hours and turned the oven  on for another 20 minutes. The roast was tender, juicy and pink from the surface to the center.

The key to this recipe is not opening the oven door.  First time I did a Standing Rib Roast and it came out just wonderful........

I varied the times on mine and it too turned out fantastic. I left roast to get to room temperature about 3 hours for a five pound Prime Rib. I then pre-heated my oven to 450F and roasted 1 hour then turned the oven off and left as stated 2 hours . Saves you a bit of time as well....

This is AWESOME! The first time I cooked this was 3 years ago for my family for Christmas. They have requested it ever since. I cook the prime rib according to the directions. It turns out perfect every time. I season all sides of the roast with salt, pepper, garlic salt, rosemary, basil and oregano. I can't give you measurements for each because I am a "fly by the seat of my pants" kind of cook. I can tell you I coat the roast well with all spices and rub them into the meat. I also let the roast set for a couple of hours on the counter before I cook it. Enjoy!

I have used this recipe for 30 years, and it is perfect every time. I usually cut garlic cloves and insert on the fatty side.  Also, rub with Worchestershire Sauce.  It really is a good idea to have the roast cut off the bone and tied together for roasting.  Makes serving so much easier.  This is a keeper.  Gloria

I made this rib roast for Christmas last year and it was fantastic.  I combined  some sour cream, horseradish and a little bit of lemon juice and it was the perfect compliment to the roast.

This dish has become our annual Christmas Eve meal. At first I was worried it wouldn't be done. I was very surprised and pleased at the results. I don't know how it works but it's done perfectly. The end pieces are well done and the middle is rare. Perfect for everyone!!

Just put mine in the oven....used onion powder also and rubbed with olive oil first... added beef broth to the pan ....got my fingers crossed...smells delicious already....5 stars even though I haven't tried yet ! okay we ate dinner and I just wanna say omg ! This was the BEST prime rib I have ever eaten !! Better than any I've ever had in any resteraunt...cannot wait to make again and this will be our xmas dinner every year...my roast was about 4 lbs and I followed the recipe exactly only adding onion powder to the garlic salt and pepper and I added about 1 cup of beef broth to the pan and I didn't use a rack....well worth the cost

Yes, this recipe is foolproof.  When I saw Paula Deane demonstrate it on her TV show I had my doubts but after trying it, I agree - the roast comes out beautifully.

I tried this recipe last week. I can't even tell you how wonderful it was.......I can only try.....mouthwatering. Although I did have to change up the cooking time. I had a 4 pd. roast and wanted to eat earlier. I put it in the oven at 400 for the first hour and then turned it down to 350 for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Cooked it till it reached 150 internal degrees. We like ours more on the medium+ side. It was so tender and moist. I will try it exactly like the recipe the next time. My husband said it was the best he had ever had!

I cooked a prime rib this way for my husband's birthday!  We prefer our meat more to the medium well side so for first required cooking time, I cooked it for 90 minutes, after the 3 hour period with the oven off and the 2nd required cooking time I added a package of onion soup mix and 2 cups of sherry and cooked the roast for 90 minutes.    It was fabulous!!!

I had to read through all the reviews to find someone who had cooked a smaller roast this way.  I had a 2.78 pound roast.  I seasoned it with Montreal Steak Seasoning as others did.  I added extra pepper, salt, and garlic powder.  You CANNOT salt the roast until right before you cook it!!  Salt draws out moisture if it sits on the meat.  Since the Steak Seasoning has salt in it do not use it too early!  I put mine in a dish resting on its side on onion halves but next time I'll use a rack.  I cooked mine for 30 minutes, then turned the oven off for 2 hours.  I decided to check the temp and it was 138.  I knew it was almost done but I had othr stuff to prepare so I let it sit almost another 45 minutes (I turned the oven on for about 4 minutes to replace the heat I let out), then turned the oven on again for about 10-15 minutes as everything else was getting finished.  I have a big toaster oven to do other stuff.  For au jus I put about 1/2 cup beef broth in the dish at the beginning and then added another 1/2 cup for that last 10 minutes.  It was yummy.  It turned out a perfect medium rare--pink but no running blood.  Oh, I did have the oven light on the whole time so that might have kept the oven warmer and it is a brand new oven so it is well insulated.

I have to thank the person for sharing their foolproof recipe and everyone who sends in their reviews. I made this roast following the instructions as they are and everyone of my guests (18) keep talking about how great my prime rib roast was so tender. Thanks for making me look good. This method is the best.

Throw all of your other recipes away!  Trust the directions and follow them.  I had a 7 1/2 lb. roast and, altho I was tempted to roast it just a little longer, I didn't.  Wow!  Juicy and a perfect medium rare throughout.

This really is fantastic, and easy as can be. I've followed it now at least 5 times. And while I can't get over a bit of nerves each time, just because the cut of meat is so expensive, it's never failed to make a perfect roast. Just do exactly what it says, and let the meat get up to 145 on the reheat and it will be awesome. People I serve it to can never stop raving about it afterward, and I agree. I always tape the oven door shut just to make sure no one opens it.

I had never cooked a prime rib before and followed the recipe exactly. I used a meat thermometer and could see the temp rising as it was sitting in the over with the temp off.  Resisted the urge to open the oven and it turned out perfect.

Made as directed.  This rib roast was delicious.  Not many ingredients for the rub so it doesn't overpower the meat.  (I made another recipe & the rub was too spicy so it took away from the flavor  of the roast) I did put a thermometer in the roast.  Needed to make Au Jus though~2 c. water, 1 beef boullion & 1/2 tsp crushed Rosemary. Boil. Good & light Au Jus for this Rib Roast. ~Perfect recipe!

I was totally prepared to be wowed by this. Followed directions EXACTLY, and was a little afraid my roast would be too rare, as I was using a 7 pounder. At 120 degrees my "little voice" kept telling me to take it out, but I didn't listen. Result, totally well done, awful, overcooked roast. My only saving grace was that I had bought the roast on a very good sale. Going to make soup from the leftovers. What a waste of time and money.

Got this recipe back in 80's from Womens Cattlemen Association.. It will work on any cut of meat, regardless of weight.... I have made several times with anything from chuck to beef tenderloin.  DONT OPEN THE OVEN... THAT IS THE SECRECT..  make sure your meat is at room temp before you put in oven.  If you have people that are the "well done" "dead on the hoof" type you should add some time to intial cooking. People can't believe this method works.. It does if you do it right., everytime.

I'm not sure what I could have done differently, but my $30, 5lb roast turned out awful... It was completely overcooked and dried out.  It tasted 'okay' because it was like dry roast beef.  I followed the directions to a tee except I used slightly less salt than called for as 2 tsp seemed like a lot. I also added some water to the reheating stage because it looked SO dry. The roast I had was split in half and this may have been the problem - SO disappointing for Christmas dinner to not get the medium rare roast I was hoping for! I am not sure how everyone who rated these instructions so high obtained such good results; I chose this recipe based on their comments. So unless you have a very large roast I would not recommend leaving this to sit in your oven for three hours.  Use a thermometer and follow a different recipe....

Foolproof is right!  I've made this five times and everytime it comes out perfectly. I've used it for roasts ranging from 4lbs to 6lbs and the same method applies to all.  Flavorful, juicy, perfectly done.  Rib roasts are so expensive, you need a recipe that won't fail.  This is it.  Couldn't be easier.  Thank you for this awesome recipe.

Just made tonight using a 4lb roast.  Adjusted cooking time for smaller size. Nice and pink on the inside. I did take another reviewers suggestion and took it out when it was between 120-125 degrees.  This was my first time cooking this cut of meat and while it isn't my favorite it was delicious. Just expensive but got mine on sale for $5.49 a lb.  Really the same price if you have a family of 4 and bought 4 ny strips or ribeyes.

I have done it this way for probably 20 years.  I do stud mine with garlic.  It also works with lamb (rib or boneless leg). I saw the technique on a cooking show.  So long ago I can't remember which one.

I tried this last year for our Christmas night dinner and it did not work. Could have been my gas oven but when I opened the oven to start the reheat process it was still nearly cold in the center.Our  meal was set back nearly an hour and a half waiting on the meat to cook. Get a good thermometer and use that instead!!

Followed directions to the tee and ended up with dry tough piece of meat.  Very disappointed, too well done.  Wonder if using a bag would be a better idea.

I have not tried the recipe yet so gave it 5 stars so the reviews would not be messed up.  I am a master food preserver.  I am concerned about the safety of leaving in the oven for 3 hours after cooking.  The general rule is no longer than 2 hours or throw it out.

Even better if you pack the roast the day before in Montreal Steak Seasoning - pack it completely! Drop to room temperature and cook! YUM!

I made this with a 9 lb rib roast and it was PERFECT!  I also use a convection oven and followed the recipe to a "t".  Enjoy!

Made this for Easter turned out perfect for us because my Dad likes it rare and we like more med rare. Cooking again for our Thanksgiving dinner and will cook the last part for an hour because we are making a 9# roast. For the review that said it does not work in gas oven, use an oven temp gauge and make sure it is at the 375 temp before putting roast in oven and look at where your oven is set at so you know where to set it second time. Made a sauce of beef boullion, dash of worchestershire, A1, and garlic, {may have to adjust to your taste}  heat and spoon over when serving.

You won't believe it! amazing! Watch your salt because the outer part of the roast gets "crispy" and intensify s  the flavor.    Hi! this is leftoverQueen and it is now 2015, I was reading this recipe again and I thought the starting temperature was higher than 375 when  I cooked it before (500) so I was looking around and found chef Johns recipe and HIS was more like the way I did it. I don't know if the recipe got changed or I just thought 500 would work better.   Also VERY important to leave at room temp, but I covered mine with plastic wrap to keep it from exposed  to the air.

The reviews say to use the same cook time, just add a lil more time at the end for bigger and to get it a lil more cooked, no matter the size and for bone-in is what it seems most ppl have used. I have never made a PRR and I am looking forward to using this recipe, so thanks for posting this! Thanks for all the tips about the add'l cooking time for med-rare and for the thought of throwing in the pots with the roast. Our Christmas dinner will be amazing! I am also going to add the beef broth to the bottom, we will certainly need the au jus. I am going to do an herb and garlic crust on mine as well....this is an expensive cut of meat, so I never bought one b4 to make myself in fear of messing it up, $35 is alot of $ to mess up...I have no fear of messing this up now! I will let you know how awesome it was! UPDATE* It was AMAZING! The cook time was perfect and I used a bunch of minced garlic with EVOO, lil it of chx broth, S&P, and steakhouse seasoning, rubbbed all over the outside. I put a can of can of beef broth in the bottom of the roasting pan. It did evaporate, leaving no au jus, but was still very moist! It was amazing....to say the least. Thanks for a awesome way to cook this, now I will have to make this more often... My hubby and I have gourmet palates from being all over the world, and he said that it was probably the best meal of his life!!!

This was good,but I prefer my rib roast very rare, so I oven roast it at 250 degrees and it turns out rare all the way through.Notice the photo the outer one inch layer is well done,so the dog would get that.

I made this for my family for Thanksgiving and prayed that all the reviews were correct and that it would be perfect if I prepared it exactly as the recipe stated.  I put a note on the oven door after the turning the oven off after the first hour of cooking and let my family know that if anyone opened the door, they would ruin the Prime rib and thus, Thanksgiving.  After three hours I reheated my oven and cooked for another 45 minutes.  I then crossed my fingers opened the oven and put in the meat thermometer and it was cooked perfectly!  This was the best Thanksgiving and my family is begging for Prime rib for Christmas!

I was afraid that I might screw up an expensive cut of meat since my Thermopen instant read thermometer never let's me down.  But not having to check the meat temp every few minutes was enticing enough to give it a try.  Outstanding!  It was easily the best I ever made, and the easiest too.

I tried this recipe as a direct result of reading the reviews. I have to say that I was just as pleased with it as everyone else.  I also made 2 smaller roasts together so that I could leave 1 in a little longer in the end so that my guests who like theirs a little more done would be happy. Both roasts came out with equal applause from all my guests. It was a definite hit.

I thought the directions were crazy but after reading all the reviews thought I'd give it a try.  WOW this was the best I've ever had!  The meat was so juicy and could almost be cut with a fork.  Everyone loved it for Easter dinner.  I added rosemary to the herbs and increased the last cooking time to 1 hour - the outer ribs were medium and the center was medium rare.  I also added a can of beef broth to the pan at the start which gave me a good base for an au jus.

FOUR points.  FIRST:   The night before, unwrap rib roast and let it sit uncovered in the refrigerator. This dries out the surface a bit for better browning.    SECOND: A popular review states that the oven time doesn't vary, regardless of the roast size,   This is untrue.   The  cooking time varies.    What doesn't vary is the amount of time the roast rests in the oven.   Multiply the exact weight of the roast by 5.  I cook the rib roast at 500 F for that many minutes, for a *medium rare* prime rib.   Roast a bit longer for meat that is more done.  Ex: 3 pound roast: 3x5=15, so cook at 500 for 15 minutes.    Turn the oven off & wait 2 hours before opening the oven door. Remove & slice.   THIRD:   For food safety,  use temp instead of time to determine when the meat is as ready:  120F  rare, 130F medium-rare, 140F medium,  150F medium-well, or 160F well done.      FOUR:  I roast at a higher temp bc  this sears the roast, seals in juices, and create a beautiful brown crust.

Excellent. I'm in charge of the roast for every family holiday and gathering and this is how I do it every time, to rave reviews. Recipe works as-is for most sizes of prime rib roast, however for larger roasts (my latest was 18 pounds!!!!) the only change I would make would be to increase the cooking time at the end of it. For the 18-pounder, I re-heated for 1 hour before serving (instead of 30-40 minutes) and it came out perfectly medium-rare. If you prefer it more well-done, I'd say to leave it in there for 1:15-1:20. Also, I let it rest for at least 30 minutes before carving. Best prime rib you'll ever eat!

This turned out really well.  Our roast was only about 2 lbs, so I kept the same times, but dropped the temp to 375 degrees.  I also used olive oil to coat the roast so that the seasoning would stick better.  Then I wrapped it in aluminum foil to hold in the juices.

I followed this to the letter I was impressed.  NOTE: remove drippings before reheating & use for ajus otherwise the drippings burn and smell up the house.

Had this for Christmas dinner. Turned out perfect. Wasn't too sure about the cooking method, but followed recipe exactly and it turned out great. For a little extra flavor, I also rub McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning on the meat.

I made this on Sunday with a 4 1/2 pound roast.  It was good but beyond medium rare ... probably closer to medium well.  Just for the record, my oven usually needs longer times than what most recipes call for,  I used a probe that transmits a signal to receiver so I could see the temperature through the whole process.  I cooked it at 375 for 50 minutes instead of an hour (because it was less than 5 lb) before turning the oven off but the internal temp got to almost 165 before it started dropping.  It tasted good but the next time I'll cook less time up front.

This is how my grandmother ALWAYS made her prime rib.  She would cut slits in the roast, stuff them with slivers of fresh garlic and then would sear it all over in oil.  She would then" season and roast" as the recipe states.  I don't think the searing part was necessary because following the recipe above as is written creates a lovely outside texture, but you didn't mess with grandma!  Her roasts always came out fabulous. 
 I used to have this recipe just memorized, but then didn't make it for such a long time I forgot the basics.  So thank you for posting it on the sight.

Best roast we've ever had.  A little rare for our taste, just added another 30 minutes to final cooking time.

Followed it step by step but had to extend the time for a bigger size rib roast (about 5 lbs) by 30min for the initial and 20min for the reheat. Sooooo easy! Loved it!

Truly delicious.  Followed recipe exactly.  After it was finished, I made an au jus by pouring 1 cup of red wine to the pan over medium heat.  Then I stirred until the brown bits dissolved and then I poured in 2 cups of beef broth.  I then let it go to a boil.  I tasted and added additional salt and pepper to taste.

Made this roast Christmas day and followed the recipe exactly but the roast was not cooked, there was bright red blood everywhere when I cut it. Will use a different recipe next time.

We doubled the recipe, which called for (2) 5.5 lb roasts.  So, we bought (1) 11 lb roast.  Perhaps it was the size of the single roast, but it took little over an hour longer than recipe stated to reheat.  Next time we'll probably leave the oven on 200F instead of turning off.

Amazing!  I was very skeptical because I had not been able to get the roast to true room temperature so I had to resist the urge to start the oven early. My roast was a little more than medium, but still pink and juicy and everyone loved it.  My Dad is a great cook and can make roast beef in his sleep.  Even he thought it was great and asked for the recipe.

as were many other reviewers, we were VERY hesitant to try this recipe. Leave a pricey piece of meat in an oven that's not on for 3 hours and never peek at it? Well I followed the instructions verbatim and ended up with an absolute PERFECT rib roast. There were cuts of meat to everyone's liking, rare, medium rare, and medium. Fantastic recipe. Thank you!

Contrary to what at least one reviewer said, you can not use the same cooking times for every size roast. I had a 3lb roast, cooked it less than the instructions, and it was waaaaaay too done.

Top of the line -- could not have impressed me and my guests more! And one of my guests was a gal who is at the top of the food chain so to speak. She must have 40 or more cookbooks and considers herself "IT" as far as cooking goes. She quizzed me over and over how I made this roast and I kept repeating the simple instructions as written and she just COULD NOT BELIEVE IT! . So, there you go. The power of simplicitiyk!!! :-)

I have used this method of cooking my Prime Ribs many times and everytime it comes out perfect. I do use a different rub from the one here, but the most important thing is how the meat is perfectly cooked everytime by using this method.

First time with this method.  not terribly pleased with results.  the cross section of the roast came out like an archery target.  well done outer ring, medium inner ring, med-rare center spot.  

although this method is simple and a great starting point for the first time prime-rib chef, it does not produce a very uniform doneness. 

375 is just TOO HOT for prime rib. better to go with:

1. the slow and low to target temp
2. rest and wait
3. high temp finish for the light char effect

you get uniform medium-rare with a nice external bark.  Perfection.

Fool Proof is a great stating point.  Try it at least once to get stated into being a Prime-Ribber for life.

This was my first rib roast I ever made; followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I used a small roast, about 3 lbs.  It came out well done, so I would probably cut down the cooking time next time.  Still came out delicious.  Thanks!

First time using this.
Turned out great, would certainly recommend this recipe. Maybe add some liquid during the last 45 mins.
Very simple & uses less Hydro.
Thanks

This was amazing. I was nervous as it is a pricey cut and it was Easter dinner! But, I followed the recipe to the exact process and it was perfect! It really is as good and even better than prime rib in the restaurant. My husband and I are picky beef eaters and this was fabulous. It may be the best thing I ever made him. He couldn't believe I had never made it before. Thanks for the great recipe!

Foolproof is the perfect title to this recipe. I have never made beef roasts and this is the 2nd time I have used this recipe (my boyfriend loves a beef roast) And both times I was stunned how AMAZING the recipe tasted. So juicy and so easy to make. Obviously it takes a look time to cook and you don't have an oven for sides. You just have to plan accordingly. Delicious!!!

This was the first time I'd ever made a roast. It was difficult to leave the stove alone.  It smelled wonderful.  The roast was a little more rare than I liked, but it worked out.  I sliced the meat then warmed it up a little and it was perfectly cooked.

Not worth the wait.  My oven vents out the heat so I had to keep it on warm to compensate.  Meat was overdone and not very moist.  Cooking at 350 for 1.5 to 2 hours is much better.

I cooked a 2 1/2 pound roast and it overcooked.  I think you do have to adjust with smaller roast.  I never once opened the oven all day, which made it difficult picking side dishes that didn't require using the stove. The crust on the pork was delicious.

Wow, this was delicious!! Made this recipe on Christmas Day and it was definately one of the best dinner's we've ever had.  Made some au gratin potatoes with it and it was a hit!!

12/16- Made this recipe again this year, it's still a hit!  Used a 7 lb pre seasoned roast from Costco.  It actually cooked much quicker than I expected!  So yummy!  I put it on a rack and put 2 cans of beef broth in the bottom of the pan.  The roast drippings made the most delicious au jus!!

I bake at 350.  And instead of the ingrredients listed, I used montreal seasoning.  Coat in olive oil and then generously pour on the montreal sasoning.

Easy - and this method works! Great! I also used rosemary and fresh garlic in my rub.  It is the day after Christmas, and I am making the prime rib soup posted on allrecpes, with added veggies.  Yum!

A winner! Cooked up juicy, moist and tastey. Easy ... follow the instructions and you shouldn't have any problems. We like this cut of meat cooked a little more and it was no problem to do.

This recipe works perfectly!  We tried this recipe for the first time on Christmas Eve with a 6lb roast!  It was the best prime rib we have ever had!  Followed the recipe exactly....will never cook a prime rib any other way! Thank you.

Awesome! I thought this would be a lot of garlic but it was perfect! I didn't cook it like it said though, I was scared! I ended up cooking for 20 mins at 450 then an hour and a half at 325 for my 6.5 pound roast. It came our perfectly rare and I added potatoes and carrots to the pan to cook as well and they soaked up some of the juices which made them taste wonderful.

So. I'm the type of fellow that can take the easiest recipe going- and find a way, in spite of everyone saying that it can't POSSIBLY go wrong- and find that one way to to make it do exactly that. Guaranteed.  Except, as it turned out, with this one. 'Nuff said.

I'm guessing my old oven does not keep its heat well enough. I had to cook it almost 2 hours longer that recommended here. Still, when we finally got to eat it, it was very tasty.

I was VERY nervous about cooking such a prime piece of meat.  I was so glad that so many people had such a great success with this recipe--I did as well!  It turned out PERFECTLY!  My family and our guests were so impressed!  I took pictures of it to share with family and their mouths were watering just looking at the picture.  If you've never made a rib roast before, or are looking for an "easier" version THIS IS IT!  Thanks so much!!

I used a 4 pound  rib roast...seasoned it and followed the directions, however the second cook time I did 50 min because my family likes it more well done. Next time I think I will stick to the 30 minutes but all in all for well done it was extremely juicy. I also put my roast in 4 ciups of beef broth for extra flavor and juiciness...yummy!

THIS RECEIPE IS AMAZING! First time cooking a prime rib and was nervous considering it's not a cheap meat to practice with. Turned out PERFECT! I followed directions mostly and fine tuned with a few tips. I lined the bottom of the pan with quarted yellow onions for a bit of a zip. I followed directions other than at the moment it was time to turn oven back on for the remaing 30-40 minutes. I quartered small red potatoes, seasoned them in olive oil and Mrs. Dash garlic and onion seasoning and when it was time to turn oven on I had someone ready, we pulled oven rack out, they lifed rib roast up by rack and I quickly dumped the potatoes in. We settled rib roast rack back in and closed door... roast was at serving temp in 40 minutes! Wrapped in foil to settle in flavors while I prepared a red wine mushroom gravy au jus. Fantastic! Everyone raved! Although my 10lb roast was a bit spendy... will do it every Xmas from now on! Never will a restaurant prime rib compare!

I have to agree with Kate's 12/25/09 review.  This recipe is not original to the submitter.  It is word for word Paula Deen's recipe from foodnetwork.  An excellent recipe which I have made many times and, yes, it is foodproof.  Thank you, Paula Deen, for a truly wonderful recipe and shame on you, Allrecipes, for letting this one slip by you and not giving credit where credit is due.

This is a great method for cooking standing rib roast.  Keeping the oven door closed is the hardest part.

Do NOT be scared to do this!  I've never made a rib roast before, and this recipe's maiden voyage for me was as the star of a dinner party.  It truly is foolproof provided you follow the directions.  I only wish I'd bought a bigger roast.  I will never make ham for Christmas again.  This is so easy and delicious... this is the way to go!

Foolproof! Perfect! I, too, was a little sceptical about the cooking method but it was great!  The second time I fixed it I even pulled it out of the oven after the 3 hour wait time and wrapped it in foil and chilled in the fridge.  The next day I took it out, let it warm to room temperature and put it back in a preheated oven until heated through. I was still perfect.  Even my fussy mother-in-law loved it!  Will definitely use again and again.

What can I say? It worked beautifully!    Of course, everyone adjusts the seasonings to their own family's preference, so there's no point in telling you what to do to please MY family.  Don't be afraid to experiment with the seasonings to delight your own crew.

My search for the best oven roast is over. This is it !!  The best beef I've ever had. My roast was pretty small - so the initial bake time was adjusted - but I still left it in the oven for close to 3 hours. I used the Montreal Steak spice....  amazing!!

As a seasoned chef, I like coming to allrecipes.com and exploring new ideas.  As many of you, I was a bit skeptical as to how this method of cooking would work.  I have cooked hundreds of rib roasts before, but never in this way.  I tried this for a special dinner last night with a 6.25lb standing rib roast.  It turned out wonderfully; perfectly crusted on the outside and a wonderful shade of medium rare pink on the inside.  This proves this method of cooking is not only for the novice, but for experienced chefs alike.  Bravo!!

This is how I have made prime rib roasts for years except that I let it sit in the turned-off oven for only 1 hour instead of 3 hours.  The other thing is that it doesn't matter how big the roast is.  It works out perfectly every time.

This was absolutely foolproof!  Like others I was somewhat sceptical at first, but thought I'd give it a try.  I did as another rater suggested and rubbed all over with olive oil then added steak seasoning.  We made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out perfectly.  Thank you!

All I can say is Wow! It works!  My husband said the best prime rib ever.  The meat just melted as you sliced and ate.  I cooked 4.5 pound with bone 1 hr and 5 min, waited 2 hrs and 55 min and when I turned on oven added cheesey potatoes II (recipe from here) to the oven and cooked for 35 min.  It was super, most meat was medium as family likes.  We decided that this recipe will become a Christmas tradtion.

Tender, extra juicy, and flavorful! I had a 3.5 lb bone-in prime rib roast, so I adjusted the times based on other reviews  afraid of it being too medium. I applied the spice rub w/ softened butter after piercing roast with 1/2 inch slits all over - then let sit covered for 2 hours until room temp. I cooked the roast at 375 degrees for 45 minutes, turned off the oven and left it off & unopened for 2 hrs 50 minutes. Without reopening, I turned the oven back on 375 and heated through for 30 minutes. Took out roast and digital meat thermometer read 129 degrees, 139 degrees after 15 minutes of "rest." The prime rib ended up deliciously medium rare - but on the fringe more medium than I prefer. I'll probably adjust the oven off time to 2:40 hrs next time and do every thing else the same. I'm so glad I found this recipe and the super informative reviews!

I was really hesitant to try this recipe but since other roast recipes have let me down, I thought...what the heck.  WOW!  It was amazing.  The best roast I have ever made.  
My small changes included:
- liberally coat roast with Montreal Steak Spice. 
- let stand for 2 hours before. 
- use a sharp paring knife to poke small holes 1 inch deep all over the roast. stuff each hole with a sliver of garlic. 
- After removing the roast from the oven, wrap tightly in aluminum foil and let stand 20 minutes.  

Voila!  Perfect Roast Beef.

This was also my 1st rib roast, i also added the rosemary to the rub, not peeking was very hard... it smelled so good, after i let it sit in the oven for the 3hrs. i looked at it and said this is INCREDIBLE!! i added quartered potatos, carmelized onions, and baby carrots, i was out of celery or i would have added that too, then i put it back in for 1hr. and 15 extra mins. so that it could be med. when we ate it, everybody thought it was absolutely delicous!!! thank you! 5 stars all the way!!!

Our roast turn out very nice, moist and tender - however, I had a 6.5lb roast and I followed the times for the 5lb after reading reviews and wanting ours rare-medeuim rare. It worked out okay for us, our roast was medeium rare, but I'm sure it would have overcooked if I had a 5lb roast. Thanks for the recipe!

This was the easiest Recipe I have used for  a Rib Roast. The end cuts came out well done but still moist the nice slice on each side was a nice medium rare, and the middle was a perfect rare. You could use this recipes with many different dry rubs or none at all.

I have tried numerous roast recipes and by far this one is the best and it is so simple. My kids are only 3 & 5 and they gobbled it up, my husband keeps asking when I'll be making it again. Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe.

Try this as an option, found Chef Johns recipe and it was flawless . Heat oven 500 deg. Cook rib for 5 minutes a pound if you rib is 4.5 lbs then go to the next higher so you would cook for 25 minutes. Turn oven off and leave in there , do not open the oven for any reason. 2 hours later rib is a perfect med to med rare. 
Notes: bring rib to room temp or as close as you can, I let mine sit out for 5 hours on the countertop before cooking. 
Do not open oven door for any reason during that 2 hour stand. 
Let rib rest for 15 to 30 minutes before carving , rib is still cooking internally so try to let it rest to get a juicy cut. 
End cuts will be closer to medium. 
Use whatever rib you desire .

I have a similar recipe that works every time !  Mine has the oven up to 500 degrees.  Calculate 5 min.per pound for rare; 5 1/2 mins for medium and 6 mins. for well-done.Roast for the desired doneness.  Then turn the oven off for 2 hours and do not PEEK !  I like this recipe because the seasonings do not have to be mixed with flour and rubbed all over the roast.  Thanks for sharing.  Will try it soon. [Guess my recipe is a  "tweak" but the differences are minor.]

I have used a similar method for many years.  The only difference is;

1. preheat the oven to 350, tent my roast after applying the rub.
2. shut the oven off after 1.5 hours and leave the roast in the unopened oven an additional 1.5 hours.

A 5lb rib roast comes out a perfect medium in the middle.

I followed this recipe to the T using an expensive 3 1/2 pound roast and it turned out rare, bleeding actually and this is after approx. 6 hrs of following the above directions.

 I started out by checking my oven's temperature, I let the roast sit on counter for an hour, rubbed it with the spices then cooked it for an hour at 375 degrees and after an hour turned oven off and let it sit in the oven and never once opened the oven door for the entire 3 hour wait time. At the end of the 3 hours I cooked the roast for another 45 minutes following the recipe and it was still to rare and bleeding in areas.
Honestly people, why are you raving about a method that doesn't work it just doesn't make sense unless you like your meat raw or have similar tastes to that of a mountain lion then maybe but really 'are you kidding me'. 

I am a mature cook and would not advise anyone to use this recipe. I don't beleive the write-ups on this method are real, there can't possibly be that many people out there who like bleeding rawish meat.

Final word of advice, if your chose to ignore me then start early in the day, remember the roast sits on counter for an hour, then cooks for an hour at 375  then sits in a oven that is turned off for 3 hours then back in again for whatever time is needed.

Easy recipe and everyone loved it. I followed the directions exactly, added 15 minute on the second cook since I had a 10 pound roast, let it rest 20 minutes before carving and it was a perfect med rare in the middle and medium on the ends! Will definitely use it again

JANCHIP was right to reduce the time for a smaller roast. I took her advice with my 3.27# Top of the Rib rolled roast, also known as a Cap roast, which has NO Fat on it, which I got at Costco as a Glatt Kosher roast. Tried this recipe on it and it was fabulous. For the 3.27# roast I took about a third of the netting off of the ends and just left a little in the middle to keep it from unrolling. Maybe could have left it all on. I rubbed the seasonings on it and roasted it for 40 minutes. (might have been better 30 minutes) It was about 145 degrees then. Left the door closed and 2 hours later turned the heat on again for 20 minutes. It was very tender, with a little pink, very juicy. Not knowing what to expect, I had made this way in advance, so I put it in a crockpot on warm with no added liquid to hold a few hours. It was no longer pink, and was a little less juicy, but still very tender and yummy. I poured hot water over the dried drippings from the bottom of the pan and just swirled it to get the dark juices without the congealed blood. I poured that liquid into a pan, and thought it could use a little more salt and a couple of pressed garlics. I put that liquid in a pan in the oven along with other things I was cooking. When I served, I cut the roast and poured the liquid over it. It was very delicious!

This recipe is fantastic. I am a rib roast fanatic. My husband told me the last time I made this that it was the best prime rib he has ever tasted. It comes out perfect everytime you make it. I highly recomend this recipe and never open the oven door for the 3 hours and you will have a perfect roast every time.

I made this tonight and it was the first rib roast I have ever done!  This recipie is perfect and is so easy!  I was nervous about the cooking method, but it worked perfectly!  I used a 4-1/2 lb boneless rib roast and followed the directions exactly.  The hardest part of the whole recipie was NOT opening the oven door to check on it!  This recipie is a keeper....

Excellent recipe...we had 2 guests for dinner and they absolutely loved the roast.  I followed the recipe exactly for a slightly over 3lb roast.  No meat thermometer used, but it was perfectly done.

Absolute perfection! I did use a different rub - 1Tb of Olive Oil, 1 1/2t salt, 1t thyme, 1t black pepper, and 7 cloves of garlic. Followed the cooking directions exactly as the recipe stated - perfect. Thanks for this great recipe!

Not wanting to ruin a 4.5 lb. roast that cost upwards of $40, I tried this recipe and YES, it does work to make the roast incredibly tender and succulent.  Highly recommend to all.  The spice rubs can be of your own choosing but as others have emphasized, DO NOT open that oven!!  It's worth it.

I loved this recipe.  Have always wanted to know how to make a perfect roast...and this is it.  For new cooks:  DO NOT BE AFRAID TO TRY THIS. IT IS A PERFECT HOLIDAY, IN-LAW, OR BOSS MEAL!!  I served it french onion soup, green sald with raspberry vinegrette, mashed potatoes, au jus, and green bean almadine with balsamic vinegar.  Perfect meal for those I love.

We followed this recipe exactly for our 2012 New Years Dinner other than adding extra spices to the rub.  Turned out beautifully with almost the whole 5 lb. roast a wonderful medium rare. It was no problem as our family prefers that cut, but if you do have guests who like it more well done, you can always slice their piece and cook it in the au jus for a few minutes.  I will never cook a price rib again without using this basic recipe.

I had never made rib roast before and was hesitant to spoil our Christmas Eve dinner.  But, followed the recipe as written and it turned out wonderful!  Increased the final baking time slightly, as recommended by other reviewers, to make the roast medium-rare.  Added a pan of potatoes to roast with 1/2 an hour left to cook; and added a pan of asparagus to roast with 15 minutes left to cook.  The whole meal was complete and ready to serve at the same time.  Thanks for the wondeful recipe!

OH, WOW!  This was my first time ever making a Prime Rib roast and I was worried about messing up.  However, this is one fantastic recipe.  I let the roast come to room temp for an hour, sprayed olive oil on the roast ( a small change from the recipe's instructions) and put 2tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, and 1 tsp. of garlic powder on the roast, as directed.  I cooked exactly as directed, and my DH was SOOOO enamoured with this roast.  We like our meat well done, so when I turned the oven on for the second roasting, I actually left the roast in for extra 20-25 minutes (for a total of 1 hour, 5 minutes).  So good.  You will not be disappointed.  (I also followed the reviews and did not open the oven door once!)

Made this for the first tme last night, this was so easy and fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly, except I left the roast in for an hour for the second cooking to get a medium roast, and it was done to perfection.  The whole family loved it. Next time I mght put some beef broth in the pan as another reviewer suggested to make gravy, the drippings were yummy.

Omg! We just finished our New Years Prime Rib. I followed this recipe to a tee, and it was "the bomb"! My first prime rib and it was so easy. Was nervous about the cooking method, but did it anyway. Used a 5.75 lb cut, and was perfect! Thank you so much!

Like many other reviewers I was extremely uncomfortable the the cooking time but tried it and it was absolutely delicious. Much better than 5 stars. I did switch out some of the ingredients - i.e. omitted salt and used Montreal Steak seasoning instead and added chopped rosemary.  Coated the roast the day before with the seasoning and received rave reviews from family and daughter's in-laws.  Will make again.

I took the risk with our Christmas boneless rib roast.  What a hit!!!  Agreed, the down side is your oven is not available for other items to cook but I planned the menu with that in mind. Now that I have found this recipe, I don't believe I will ever cook a roast any other way.

I have cooked my rib roast this way for years and it has never failed.  Doesn't matter what size roast you are cooking because all you have to do is let it stay in during the last cooking period until it's done to your liking.  Give an approximate time you will serve the roast and let the roast determine the exact time you serve it.  If your guests have to wait so be it.  This one is worth the wait!

I made this exact recipe for Christmas this year. It came out PERFECT. My husband was very sceptical about 3 hours in the oven. Do this, you wouldn't be disappoint. We used 7 pounds and kept time the same.

Liked the idea in concept. Followed directions exactly as written. On the "second cooking" it took longer for the roast, which on the initial hour cooking and remaing in the closed oven for 3 hours had risen to 123F and then dropped down to 109F at the end of the time, to get again back to 138F. The recipe claims 30-40 minutes of additional cooking, when it was more like 60-70. I removed at 138 instead of 40 minutes, and let set for 10-15 minutes and carved. The middle slices did have some pink in the very center, but EXTREMELY small area. While the meat had great flavor, I prefer to have the roast mostly on the pink side, medium rare, with only a thin band of medium-cooking around the edges. Other methods have yielded a much larger pink area, that is cooked but medium rare and delicious. I doubt that if I would have removed the roast at 40 minutes when it still said 127 degrees, that I would have ended up with more than  slices of roast that were raw in the middle which is the other end of the spectrum from what I am used to serving. If I use this method in the future, I may toy with the initial and secondary cooking times and temperatures. The roast did continue to cook for maybe 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or temperature of roast I should say rose. But the 3rd hour, meat temp dropped at least 16 degrees. That may be what caused issue with the extended 2nd cooking time, and why the roast appeared more done on edges.

Tried it for the first time & liked it. I would say that every individual should watch their own cooking time. I'm glad I had my cooking thermometer inserted in the meat or it would have been way over cooked. It only had to sit in the "off" oven for about 90 mins. & then reheated for about 15 mins.  Maybe just my oven.

Had 8.2 lb. rib roast.  Followed directions and internal was between 135-140 at end of 3 hours.  I pulled immediately without any reheating.  My pull temperature was 135, so a little overdone for me.  Easy recipe but watch your meat thermometer.

Wonderful! My husband and I both agreed that it was the best roast we have eaten. I did a 3 pounder and altered the cooking time a little. I cooked it for 45 min. and turned off the oven. I was just so scared not knowing what was going on. I could smell it after 12 min and didn't want it to burn. I wish I hadn't but I will know for next time. Turned out just perfect and I will definitely be making it again!

I was skeptical about cooking my rib roast like this, but I cooked it exactly like the recipe and it was delicious!!!!  It turned out so juicy and tender.  I will definitely cook it like this from now on.  It was absolutely the best I have ever had.  I will definitely recommend this to everyone.

I got this recipe off of Paula Deens site awhile back and have made it many times and the reviews are correct, It's fantastic and pretty much foolproof. As a rib roast is quite pricey and not worth taking a chance on messing it up. 5 stars for this one it's a keeper.

It turned out perfectly!  Like, restaurant perfect!  I was shocked and so happy!  Here were my tiny modifications, based on equipment on hand and taste:  I didn't have a rack that would fit in the proper baking dish, so I put the roast on top of a layer of potatoes sliced into 1/3 inch discs (which I'd also olive oiled, and added s&p).  I rubbed the roast with olive oil before adding the rub, and added rosemary to the rub.  Our roast was small, (2 pounds), and so adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  It was perfect, perfect, perfect.  Now I know what to make for a fancy dinner the next time we have guests!  Thank you so much!

Wow this was great! I was wondering about leaving it in the oven, while the heat was turned off. But it turned out great. I use this same method for cooking a sirlion roast as well. It always turns out great! Thanks for the fool proof simple method to a  perfectly cooked roast. A keeper in my opinion. :)

This was amazing!!!  I followed the directions on the cooking time.  I used McCormack Grillmates, Montreal Steak Seasoning for the spices.  I did not cover the roast with foil. This is a keeper and I will definitely do this again!

I used this recipe to cook a 18 pound rib roast for Christmas.  It turned out great! Because the roast was so big, I cooked it for about 1.5 hours at first, left it in the oven for 3 hours, and then cooked it for about 45 minutes.  As soon as the internal temperature reached 160 degrees, I  turned off the oven and let the roast set in the oven for about 15 minutes.  It was still medium rare when it was served.  Everyone loved it! This is certainly a recipe I will use again and again; it doesn't get any easier or tastier!

I made this twice perfection both times. The first time I made baked potatoes with it be just putting them in them in at the same time i did the roast they were cooked perfectly too. This time I am did all the tradtional christmas dishes baked beans, sweet potates put in when started roast. Dressing put in when I reheated. We like our meat medium well so when I reheated it was for 50 minutes.  Served 12 people and I ejoyed the time it allows to spend with loved ones instead of in the kitchen.  Thanks so much for sharing this with us.

This method is absolutely the best way to cook the roast. But I realized when I started cooking my rib roast today that the recipe doesn't say lid on or lid off.  I used a roaster and put the lid on.  Warning to everyone using this recipe.  A lid on speeds up the cooking time.  I am so glad I checked to see how things were going or I would have overcooked the beef.    With a lid the meat does not need 3 hours of resting in the oven between the 1st and the 2nd baking.  I had a 4.3 pound rib roast and the meat was well done.  When I make rib roast again I think I'll cook for 1 hour and after 1 1/2 hours of rest, I'm going to open the oven and check on the meat.  Nothing bad will happen to the meat if you open the door early.  Some heat escapes but it will heat up again very quickly.  I did put beef broth and water at the bottom of the pan and the gravy was out of this world crazy good.

I was scared because I bought a standing boneless rib roast on sale for $2 a pound.  I thought at that price it might not be that good so I was looking for a recipe that would cook it slowly.  This turned out great!  I couldn't believe how good my roast was, very tender.  Used the seasoning as stated except I substituted some of the salt for seasoning salt.

This is perfect. DO NOT CHANGE A THING WHEN YOU TRY THIS RECIPE! Do consider taping the oven door closed though. It makes it easier to resist the temptation to peek. Absolutely amazing prime rib!

I used a 6.87 lb roast.  I cooked the roast 1 hour and 20 minutes the first time, let it sit in the oven for 3 hours and cooked it 1 hour the 2nd time, and it came out really yummy.  I just used the Grill Mates Steak Rub and thats it.  The roast is really good with Au Jus Gravy. My family raved on how flavorful and juicy the roast was.  Everybody had 2nds and 3rds, etc.

Finally! A rib roast the way it should be! Mine was only a 3.5 lb. roast (2 bones), but I followed the directions exactly, added nothing, altered nothing - and it was FANTASTIC! Better than restaurant prime rib! Now only if I could learn to carve it properly, LOL! We had a wonderful Easter dinner with asparagus, sweet potatoes and crescent rolls on the side! (Sweet potatoes perpared ahead of time; rolls prepared while the roast rested.) Thanks for a great recipe; my newest favorite!

I only wish rib roast were more affordable all year! This recipe is superb, so easy, and was the hit for my Christmas dinner. I highly recommend following the directions and not worrying about the unconventional method of leaving it in the oven without it being on. However, for peace of mind, using an internal thermometer is always a great idea (every kitchen should have one) so you have the doneness your prefer. I will say, the ends with all the good crusty bark were my favorite because of the medium doneness. The insides were a little too rare for our liking, so a quick 45 seconds under the broiler once it was sliced up made it perfect. I used my convection microwave to bake the cakes and casseroles since my oven was tied up, but I can see where that would be a problem for others. (If that is the case, having a rare roast isn't a problem. Just allow it to roast per directions--the 4 to 5 hours--then have it sit on your countertop without slicing while everything else bakes in the oven. In the last 5 minutes before you seat everyone, just slice up the roast, lay on a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil, then pop under the broiler for a minute or so to bring up the temperature and brown it up a bit. It will still be juicy, tender, and full of flavor!) Also, to a previous poster who experienced frustration with knowing whether or not to roast this covered: if a/any recipe does not say anything about it being covered, rest assured that it's NOT to be covered!

OK here's how I did it for a 5 lb roast (which fed 4 adults exactly-no leftovers). I let it sit out on counter for 1 hr. When I put it in oven the roast was 36 degrees. After 1 hr in the oven it was 81 deg. Oven off--after 1 1/2 hrs it was 140 deg, at 2 1/2 hrs it was 134 deg. and at 3 hrs it was 127 degrees. I panicked because the temp got up to 140 and since my oven runs kinda hot, i opened the oven door and left it cracked open about 10 minutes and then closed it again for the rest of the time. Next, Oven on again and at 34 min it was only at 128 deg. and at 44 minutes it was 135 degrees and then I took it out. It reached 145 degrees right at about 10 minutes sitting out on counter, covered. Oh and I also added Rosemary and minced jarred garlic to the rub.  I also took another reviewers advice and made an au jus using about 28 oz beef broth and about a tablespoon of beef boullion granules added to pan after the 3 hr oven-off period. There was some seasoning in the pan that fell off roast from the beginning so that made it even tastier! Oh and No, do NOT cover roast while in oven. Absolutely perfect! My husband, who kept bugging me to use his mom's recipe, was really impressed with this roast. He actually has been telling our friends that it was "Fantastic", which, coming from him, is a huge compliment! Made for Christmas Eve dinner and it will be a holiday tradition from now on!

This is AMAZING!  I made this for my husband as snow kept us from traveling for the holidays.  I bought a 2.5 Boneless Rib Roast and made it exactly as described and it was perfect!  We took it out after 30 minutes and the temp was at 140 so we put it back in for another 15 minutes and it came out medium-well (a little more done than my hubby likes, but the ends were perfect for me being pregnant).  The whole thing was juicy AND NOT DRY in the least!  I was very worried I would be pulling out a dry, burnt roast.  The husband keeps saying "mmm, mmm, mmm" and that it's JUST like the restaurants.  Thanks for making our Christmas Eve meal wonderful.  There really was no reason to be scared! :)

This is REALLY foolproof.  We were making our first prime rib for Christmas and we were going to use a Kosher Salt recipe.  We changed our minds at the VERY last minute, because this recipe popped up.  Thank GOODNESS we did.  The power went out several times during the cooking, so I just improvised and tried to follow as close as possible.  It turned out BEAUTIFUL AND the power came on in time for dinner!

This was my first experience making rib roast and certainly not my last. I followed the directions to the tee except when I reheated the roast I only heated it to 300 degrees. I found the 375 degrees dried it out a bit. Also I just bought a pack of au jus and mixed some of the rib roast drippings and it made it so yummy.

Unbelievable roast! Very tender and came out mid-rare. I would make sure to roast it the full three hours in the oven to do medium. The BEST prime rib I've ever eaten! We're doing this for Christmas instead of turkey. Oh, and make sure to rub in a large amount of either coarse kosher salt, or sea salt...what flavour!

Simple and savoury.  I cooked a smaller roast (only 2 lbs) since it was only my husband and I but it turned out wonderfully.  I whisked the leftover drippings with some cornstarch and broth to make gravy and it was a hit.  Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe.

I did this recipe just like it said but my rib roast was well done and dry.  Thank heavens I made gravy.  Not sure why except it could be my LaCreuset pot cooks faster than the directions say.  Will try again but less time in the oven.  (I did not peek either)

I made this for New Years Eve.  I purchased a 10 lb. rib roast.  I was really nervous since I had not ever prepared this type of roast in this unconventional way.  I have to say that it was out of this world!  Every one raved about how wonderful and tender the roast was.  A meat thermometer is a must.  I followed the directions as stated only adding about 10 extra minutes of cooking time to compensate for such large roast. Came out perfect, medium on ends and medium rare in the middle.  I had two of my guest call me the next day thanking me for such a great meal!

Roast for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Turn the oven off and leave the roast inside. Do not open the door. Leave it in there for 3 hours. 30 to 40 minutes before serving, turn the oven back on at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) to reheat the roast.

This roast was soooo worth the wait!  I followed the cooking instructions exactly and it was perfect--a big hit with everyone on New Year's Day.  My changes:  I used granulated garlic and Penzeys English Prime Rib Rub instead of the salt and pepper, and I didn't have a rack for my roaster, so I cut a large yellow onion in half and set the roast on top of that instead. The au jus was wonderful as well.  Will definitely make this again on special occasions.

I must admit i was a bit skeptical about this recipe. However.. It was as good, if not better than i had hoped for. I made this for Christmas dinner, for 20 people, and had nothing but rave reviews.
I did have to change the timing a bit, to accomodate roasting my turkey as well.
I started this roast early in the morning, cooked one hour, as per instructions, let it rest 2 hours, then turned it back on for 1.5 hours(my family is not fond of rare meat) this produced a juicy, pink on the inside, lovely brown on the outside prime rib. The taste was exceptionally good, better than most resteraunts. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Thanks for a great recipe. Like a lot of others, I was very skeptical but followed the recipe as written.  Even taping the recipe to the oven door so no one would open it.  Rubbed evoo and spices on a 7lb. roast and followed the directions.  I didn't even use a meat thermomometer.  I do however have a double oven stove and cooked my baked potatoes in the small oven. This was the easiest Christmas dinner I've cooked in years.  THANKS

Be careul with the cooking time in this recipe.I used this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner because the recipe looked pretty foolproof. The roast was about 71/2 pounds came out just all right and I might give the recipe another try but it really was over cooked for that type of beef. I left it in until it was at 145 degrees as the recipe stated, and have to say that it should have been taken out earlier. I usually only cook prime rib to 125 degrees and let it stand for a while, since we like different stages of doness, and should have followed my instinct and removed it from the oven earlier. The beef was well done and a little on the dry side. I might try this one again, but would suggest that if you like your beef other then well done, you modify the ending cooking tempurature stated in this recipe.

Absolutely AWESOME! Bravo. I was a hit with my Rib Roast at Christmas. Keeping this one at the top of my list. No variation either.

Who would have thunk?  This is almost the perfect receipe!  I had to slap my wrists to make sure I didn't open the oven before it was done standing.  The meet was incredibly moist and tender.

When opened the oven, the outside was cooked so well that I thought I had over-cooked the whole roast.  But first slice was perfect pink and oh-so-delicious!  

The compliments made my holiday complete!

I made this for Christmas dinner and my family won't stop talking about it!  One son-in-law refused to leave the table, he couldn't get enough.  I followed the recipe exactly, using an 8 pound boneless.  The middle was perfectly pink and the edges medium well.  Something for everyone!  I rubbed it with McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning.

First of all I hate to cook.  I aspire to be a good cook and be showered with praises from my friends and family with my cooking.  Yet I am in my 30's and can count on one hand how many times ANYONE has raved about my cooking, not including my kids raving over hot dogs and mac and cheese.  I was very suspicious of this recipe, but what the heck I've ruined enough meals and had some frozen pizzas as back-up.  I bought a 5.75 boneless rib roast, oiled up my roast with olive oil, added the listed spices and followed the recipe exactly.  I did leave it in a bit longer than the hour, since it was a little bigger and since I like mine more medium than rare.  My family gobbled it up, gave me the thumbs up, wanted the recipe, wanted to know when I was going to make it again and so forth...  My husband and I were both in shock - it was that easy and good!  My hubby even commented that we should have bought the 14 lb rib roast at Costco and freeze parts of it.  Do not be afraid to use this receipe!!!  It saved Christmas dinner!  ;)

Used with a rib roast. Tasted excellent.A definite must is a meat thermometer. Remember, do not open oven door.

We supply the "meat" for our office party... this year wife decided we would do a rib-roast... usually do a small roast on the grill with a thermometer, no problem... this was a whole roast, bones off, tail off.. this am when I saw it wouldn't fit in our largest pan fired up "Allrecipes" and found this one... darn if it didn't work exactly as advertised... read one of the reviews that this is how they do it in the military for lots of roasts and that sealed the deal...

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  I have made this twice now - the 1st time I followed the recipe to a T.  The second time I cook it just a little longer for our friends who like it medium - both times it was EXCELLENT!!!  I really had no idea what a rib roast was before this but it is prime rib - DELICIOUS!!!

This provides the perfect timing for a 4-5 pound roast with the times in the recipe.  it comes out perfect, even though it sounds so simple.  The spices were good without being over bearing.  I added a bit of garlic powder to the original recipe and it came out great too.  This recipe is simple and a definite keeper!!!

Fantastic! I just adjusted the seasoning to our tastes and it was cooked perfectly. I rubbed the roast in olive oil, minced garlic, Tony's seasoning, pepper, thyme and rosemary. It was the best.

Wonderful.  The timing was perfect. Was very worried about cooking this expensive piece of meat.  I used a 5lb boneless ribeye for my husband's birthday.  Rave reviews.  Thanks so much for a method to be used several times in the future.

I like most others did not expect to have a fully cooked, tender roast at the end of the 45 minutes.  But I stand corrected. It was perfect and I did as another suggested and put the carrots, onions and potatoes in with the roast on the last 45 minutes.  The recipe never said whether to cover the roast or not.  But initially for the first time in the oven I did not cover but in the last 45 minutes I covered with aluminum foil and added a little beef broth to it.  Perfect!

This was a FANTASTIC recipe!!  Our roast was 3.25 pounds, so we cooked it for 36 minutes at 375 degrees, let it sit for 1 hour 50 minutes then cooked it again for about 15 minutes.  It came our rare, juicy and delicious.  We will definitely make this again !!!!!

OK, here's what I don't get: when do you turn the oven back on to warm it up? It's supposed to be 30-40 min. before you're ready to serve. So you cook it an hour, let it sit with the oven off and closed for three hours, and then - what? Is that when you turn the oven back on? I did that, and it took another hour to get the internal temperature up to 135. So that's five hours in all (plus sitting time). Is that the way it's supposed to work? I'm pleased with the taste and texture, but I'm not sure how the whole on-off-on thing is supposed to work.

Perfect every time! I've been making this recipe for years. I do add a dry rub of crushed garlic, thyme, rosemary and Montreal steak seasoning. The roast is perfectly med rare and so tender.

Wowzerz!!! Like many others, I was sceptical about making this due to having the oven off for 3 hours.  But oh my goodness, this truly was THE BEST prime rib!! My husband even said it was better than any restaurant prime rib he's had and I have to agree.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!! The ONLY change I made was rubbing the roast down with olive oil before seasoning.

It absolutely does matter what size the rib roast is. You must absolutely modify the time otherwise you will have a well done roast if it is under 5 1/2 pounds. If you go on Pinterest you will see this  same recipe and they will tell you you must modify the recipe time for the size rib roast.   I know this first hand because I made the mistake by roasting a smaller rib roast and I did not calculate the time correctly. My first rib roast was done perfect my second smaller rib roast was well done and dry.

Followed the recipe exactly. I allowed the roast to reach an internal temperature of 155 degrees. The meat was incredibly tender. My family and guests thoroughly enjoyed it. This recipe takes dissolves the mystique of rib roast cooking.

Made this roast last night with a 3-lb standing rib roast. Same directions as the original size. This was the ABSOLUTELY the best roast I have ever had, bar none!! My husband and I both agreed that it was definitely restaurant quality. I will never make a standing rib roast any other way. As a matter of fact, it's my husband that normally cooks the roast, but I'm the one who made it this time, this way. Thank you chef, whoever you are!

This was amazing! I did have to alter the instructions a little bit though, as my grocery store only sells rib roast in 3 lbs. increments. The only thing that I did differently for my 3 lbs. roast, was to turn the temperature down from 375°F to 325°F. It was delicious!

The method is great, I didn't season the roast as much as I should have. Next time will season with more garlic and other seasonings...also...put meat thermometer in when I start to bake it....great recipe...I've never cooked prime rib before...I added water to the pan drippings an a little Kitchen Bouquet seasoning to them and it made a wonderfull Au Jus sauce for dipping....

I have to say, I was so nervous about this cooking method, especially since the meat was pretty expensive and I had never cooked one before. I ended up getting (2) 2.5 cuts. I sat them on the counter for about an hour, and sprinkled salt, pepper and Steak seasoning. I placed in a pre heated 375 oven for 30 minutes, turned off the oven and although tempted, didn't open the oven door. I let sit for one hour and 15 minutes, then turned back on to 375 for another 20 minutes. I let sit on counter for another 10 to 15 before slicing. This was absolutely amazing, simple and delicious. There was enough juice in the pan for dipping and I can't wait for the next holiday to try again! Thank you for sharing.

My husband's absolute favorite food is prime rib.  For years, I was terrified to even try it because I was afraid I'd over-cook  and ruin it.  And to spend all that money on a failed meal.  Oh no!  But, after seeing this recipe, I decided to be brave and try it.  It worked! Perfectly.  Our roast was a little over 5 pounds.  I cooked it as the recipe said, and it came out a perfect medium rare.  Yippee!!  I was thrilled and it was a wonderful Christmas present for my husband.

Made it on Christmas Eve. It was great. Programmed oven to delay start while at Mass and it was done when we got home.  I was nervous, but it was the best rib roast ever!!

This works BUT, Rub good worcestershire sauce all over the roast first.  Add a Tablespoon of DRY beef broth base to the seasoning rub.  Oven @ 450, roast in for 20 minutes  then off and allow 30 minutes per pound without opening oven.  Rest time is correct.  Got this from the prime rib chef from the Lark restaurant in Tiffin, Iowa(Long since burned to the ground).  They served the uncontested best Prime Rib in Iowa.

I first tried this recipe two years ago at Christmas and again last year. It was so perfect! I plan to cook my roast again this year the same way. I use garlic salt instead of powder and freshly ground black pepper. I do have potatoes to roast, as well, and will put them in during the last roasting time for the beef. Please try it. I know you won't be disappointed.

This is the right method, but 145 degrees will get you a medium to medium well roast.  For medium rare, I would not let it go past 130 in the final cooking time.  Check the temperature before you turn the oven back on.  Based on the size of the roast and the quality of your oven, you might already be at 130 after 2 hours with the oven off.  Based on the pictures, most of those look medium well with very little pink.  Remember that the ends will always be more cooked, so if you have guests that don't like medium rare, you can serve them the end pieces.  And keep the yummy rare pieces for those of you that know better....
And yes, somebody else has published this recipe with her name on it, but I betcha her grandmother was already using this method before she became famous.

Absolutely perfect every time. The MOST important thing is do NOT open the oven! You can season it any way you want and leave it in the oven as long as you want after turning the oven off after the first hour, as long as you DON'T  open the oven and turn the oven up to 375 for the last 30-40 minutes

No matter the size of the roast. Bring meat to room temp, place in preheated 500 degree oven for 5 min/ lb for med rare, 7 min/ lb for med, cook for the allotted time, turn oven off and serve in 1.5 to 2 HHS, do not open oven during process, perfect every time

This recipe is perfect.  The meat came out better than what I order at most restaurants. It was tender and flavorful and it was the 1st time I didn't even use steak sauce!  I made sure I thoroughly coated the roast with a beef seasoning blend and voila!  Delicioso!

I did everything wrong and my 10 lb $100 roast still turned out OK.  I cooked it at 375 for 1 hour 30 minutes.  The internal temp of the meat (left at room temp for 5 hours) was 44 degrees upon starting. After one hour at 375 it was about 88 degrees  internally,  so I left the oven on longer -- 30 minutes.  Then the internal temp was 95.  I was concerned. I taped the door shut, turned off the oven and let it sit just under 2 hours. I turned it back on to 375 and it cooked for about 45 minutes. Probe beeper went off at 135 degrees and I took it out. It sat for nearly 1 hour. The inside was still nice and pink but the probe showed that it had climbed to 150 during that one hour. My misstep here was NOT taking it out at 125 degrees.  I think that the larger the roast, the more cooking that may occur while sitting.  Don't worry though -- my guests gushed about how delicious it was. As I said, it still had some pink (medium) pieces towards the middle, lucky for me, no one wanted rare or even med rare.  A keeper recipe for sure!  You don't spend that kind of money and mess things up!  Highly recommend the temp probe with the external unit showing the meat temp. It would be impossible to see the meat temperature without opening the door with a standard meat thermometer.

I did it!  This was my first time cooking a rib roast.  Make sure to ask your butcher to "cut and tie" your roast.  It makes it easier to cut and serve.  I was a little nervous because it was so expensive, but it turned out perfectly!  I cooked a 10.67 lb. roast and didn't change the cooking time whatsoever.  I did put a little olive oil in my hand and rubbed it all over the roast.  I sprinkled kosher salt, pepper & grated 2 cloves of garlic and rubbed that all over.  I cooked it for the initial hour, 3 hrs siting in the oven, and 30 minutes upon turning the oven back on.  I made au jus from this site called Beef Au Jus from chef John.  It was so quick and easy and it was wonderful.  Great smell and flavor.  Everyone raved about the roast and "gravy".  From now on, a standing rib roast for Christmas Dinner will be our new tradition.

This was the first rib roast I ever made. I've now made it several times, and it's the only way I'll ever make a rib roast. I insert a meat thermometer before cooking, and I rarely ever make a 5lb roast, usually 2-4lbs for my small family. The meat thermometer is handy for the smaller roasts since it will cook for a shorter time. I rub olive oil and a bunch of Montreal Steak Seasoning all over it for perfect flavoring. Remember not to open the oven door, not even to peek at it. I tape mine shut to help resist the temptation. :)

This turned out perfect! We followed the directions exactly. We used a Beef Rib Roast that was 4.55 lbs. It tasted just like prime rib from any fancy restaurant that we have been to! This was my first attempt at such a meal and I will definitely make this again!!!! Thank you for the recipe!!

I've tried this method before with an eye of round roast and it worked perfectly so I figured it would work with a rib roast too.  It is just like the title says - FOOLPROOF!!  Anyone can make this roast and it is perfect everytime!  It is such an elegant meal and hardly any work at all. Great for company or when you would rather spend time with your family on the holidays.  Also great for those busy nights as you can put it in at 1:00 or 2:00, go out and run errands, etc. and still be back in time to make a delish meal!  No need to change anything about this unless you like to change up the spices you rub on the roast.  What more can I say - it's perfect!

I just made this and it turned out perfect!  I had a smaller Rib Roast at about 3 pounds and so I cooked it for an hour like it said, but only let it rest for 2.5 hours and then cooked it for another 30 minutes.  It turned out medium at an internal temp of 155.  Just like we like it.  It was very tender and the flavor was perfect.  It sounded almost too easy that I was worried it would not turn out.  I will use this every time!

This is the way I make my rib roast every Christmas. It turns out perfect. I have done it this way 3 years now. I'm always skeptical, and pleasantly surprised. I follow the timing exactly; it's too expensive to play with. Absolutely great.

I've cooked with this recipe 3 times over the last 6 months. It has worked each time. Anything smaller will need adjustments in cooking (less time) unless you like shoe leather. I also noticed my True Prime cut was far better than my Prime Select cuts. was it worth the extra $$$? maybe. But I don't always have $22 a pound to get a good true prime cut and only my Father and I noticed the difference (had 2 diff roasts to compare). 

Other tips: 
Ask the butcher to cut the ribs and tie them on, makes cutting easier. 
do NOT cut the fat off till you're ready to serve. 
If you follow this recipe and you want it "properly cooked" stop cooking 15 degrees BEFORE it reaches that temp. if you never open the door to the oven, it'll keep cooking for another 15+/- degrees. 


For you 1 star "it failed to hit 130 degrees" reviewers: 
if you roast never reaches the 130 degrees, something is probably WRONG with your oven. I replaced my original home unit and cooking was like night and day. check the seals on the door. mine was losing heat like crazy.

I tried this for Easter and I have to tell you the oven must make a difference.  I had a 5# roast, did everything as directed and had the rest of my dinner planned and done at the time the roast was SUPPOSE to be done. The roast was RAW in the center.  I checked my oven with a gauge to make sure the temperature was correct, 375 deg., and it was right on.  My oven must cool off faster than others because I don't believe it continued to cook while turned off.  I won't try this again, it's too expensive.

O M G !  This was absolutley amazing!  My husband was VERY skeptical about this cooking method, but the roast turned out fabulous!  We just rubbed it with some Monteral Steak Seasoning. Personal preference, next time I will pull the roast when the interal temp is 130/135, 145 was a littel to done for our liking!  Thank you so much for sharing this!

I have never cooked a rib roast and was very apprehensive.  I followed this recipe as written except added about a tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary to the rub.  For a 4.35 pound rib roast, the cooking time was perfect (1 hour cook, 3 hours "no opening the oven door" rest and then 30 minutes of cook.  Medium rare to rare.  Delicious!!

It turned out great. I did read the other reviews and I did it exactly as the directions stated but added an additional 10 minutes to the "warm up" time in the oven after the three hours were up. Using a meat thermometer takes the guess work out of the meat if you want it medium rare, etc. I had a 6 1/2 pound boneless standing rib roast.

I've used this recipe last year for our Christmas dinner. It turned out fantastic. I will make another this year... I did have question about the whole cooking and turning off the oven. So I used a battery operated meat temp gauge so I could keep the door closed and know when it was done. It worked out great.

Dang Dang Dang!!!!!!  Was WONDERFUL, I used an Eye of Round roast it's cheap cut but thought what the heck. Can't say enough about it my whole family Loved it. I have for years tried to figure out a medium to medium rare roast and here it is. I TRULY NOW HAVE IT EVERY SUNDAY AND WE ARE NOT TIRED OF IT YET.
Thanks so much much for putting the recipe on line :)

I liked the premise of this recipe but I found one that works everytime as well and better for me. Pre heat oven to 500 then take the actual wieght of the prime rib and multiply by 5 that is your cooking time at 500 degrees then shut oven off leave roast in for 2hrs no need to rest ready to serve and the same applys for lamb. Worked great.

As the title says it's Foolproof.  BUT FYI, you only need to rest the roast in the oven a minimum of 30 minutes so in step 3. you would "leave in the oven between 1/2 hour to 3 hours".  But have to agree, since you can't open the oven those of us who only have 1 oven need to figure out some other side dishes that don't require using the oven for them.

I have used this recipe twice - each time the prime rib came out perfectly!!  If I didn't live right next door to my mom, we might have a problem with the side dishes, but for now I will never use another method.

A recipe so easy with a perfect outcome every time. The roast stays juicy while the simple seasonings bring out the natural flavors. Proper resting time is crucial allowing the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. I would say more wonderful things about the roast but I am headed back to the kitchen to eat more and more of it.

This was a really great way to cook my rib roast.  Mine was only 2 1/2 lbs so I decreased cooking time as others recommended.  I rubbed it with an assortment of spices and it was such a great Christmas dinner for me and my boyfriend!

I cooked a 7 lbs rib roast for Christmas using this method.  The only reason I felt secure enough to cook it this way was because of all the positive reviews.  It came out exactly as it was supposed to.  I wouldn't cook it any other way.  Thank you to everyone who posted on this.  It was a tremendous help!

I just cooked a 12-lb prime rib roast for New Year's Eve using this method. It's the best I've ever made. I used a different rub, but the method was perfect. I did have to cook a little longer on the back end, but the thermometer made it a no-brainer. Perfect, perfect!

I'm making this again this year.  Last year I was told it was the best beef my party had ever had.  It's a perfect Christmas dinner.  Try it with the "Creamed Corn Like No other" here on AllRecipe.  I made a rub with  fresh minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, Montreal Steak Seasoning and olive oil.  

(Paula Deen did not make this recipe up - its been around for a long time).

2016 Holidays - made it again, and will again!

This was my first attempt to cooking a standing rib roast.  I did exactly as recipe.  Excellent.  Great job and will tell everyone about it.

Wonderful method and taste. We had to wait for a football game to finish so it sat in the off oven for almost 4 hours and was still perfect.

I did a 14lb. roast. I did the rub...but to give a little more flavor I cut small slices in the top and stuffed fresh garlic cloves.  If you like garlic...this recipe is fantastic and will be the one I use everytime. Thanks so much.

This is the Paula Dean recipe. It was excellent and i would have given it 5 stars except the salt was overkill and there were no instructions for roasts over 5 lbs. Do not assume that the cooking time would simply double if you have a 10 lb roast. 

I happen to be of the mind that less is more.  I had a 10 lb roast and used  half of the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. The beautiful crust would have been perfect with 1/4 cup of salt. Great roast otherwise. And all my guests agreed with the salt issue.

Outstanding!!  First time I made bone-in Rib Roast and it was fantastic.  I received rave reviews from the family!  I did cook to 170 degrees however because most of the family likes their meat more well done.

I've never tried to make prime rib before, and the cost of the meat made me very nervous.  Also, not being able to open the oven door to check on the meat--well, I was a wreck when time was up and I took the roast out.  I needn't have worried.  The prime rib was perfect.  I've never received so many compliments on my cooking.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Just follow the steps exactly and you can't go wrong.

Update: Made it again with a 4lb roast - still came out perfect!

A little hesitant using this recipe on such an expensive roast for Christmas Eve dinner. Put it in for the hour as suggested, turned it off and left for church.  By the time we got back, put our potatoes in and turned the oven back on for the suggested 30 minutes.  It was AWESOMELY delicious.  Perfectly cooked!

This recipe is absolutely foolproof. We added a can of beef consume to the bottom of the pan a can of water and set the roast on a rack.
When we turned the oven back on for reheating we threw parboiled tiny yukon gold potatoes in the pan.  We had plenty of "au jus" and the potatoes were perfect. The whole meal was a Christmas success!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it received rave reviews!  My roast was a 10 lb rib eye.  I did add a couple more spices than just the ones called for, but kept the baking time the same.  It came out perfect.  Thank you for the recipe and the instructions on roasting it to perfection.

Wow! Terrific! I placed roast in frig to defrost  and then when defrosted covered with garlic, olive oil and salt and let it sit in frig for 36 hours. I then removed it to come to room temp, which took two hours. Then I then slathered it on ALL  four sides with herb butter from this site. I was afraid the herb butter would just melt off but it did not. The result was a very very tender and flavorful  Prime Rib with a gorgeous crust!  My daughter is a Chef in San Francisco and was coming over for dinner so i was scared out of my wits hoping this would work, But it did!!

Thank you for the tastiest prime rib recipe ever! After letting my 12 pound roast sit out for 2 hours, I studded it with fresh garlic. I added a teaspoon of herbs de provence to the other spices and rubbed it into the roast. I followed the cooking directions as written and after the second baking I checked the internal temp with an instant read thermometer. Because of the size of the roast I did have to cook it a little longer to get the temp up to 120. After resting for 15 minutes the outer cuts were medium rare and the middle was more on the rare side. I took a short cut and used a couple envelopes of McCormick brand of Au Jus. It was simple to swirl some beef around in the hot au jus for requests for a more medium piece of beef. This was so tender and so delicious that I see no point in cooking it any other way. Yum!

After reading all the excellent reviews for this preparation I couldn't wait to try it.  We have done a Standing Rib Roast on Christmas for many years and the cooking has been my responsibility, something that always meant many hours of close attention to the oven, this was the most carefree culinary day I've had in a long time.  I followed the recipe exactly, one hour out of the fridge to get the meat up towards room temp, then one hour at 375 degrees, 3 hours of closed up oven with heat off, then the last hour back at 375.  15 or 20 minutes of stand time, slice and serve.  It was perfect, medium rare center and delicious.  Thanks, I'll never get stressed out over cooking $65.00 worth of beef again.

My Christmas prime rib came out fabulous. I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of marjoram to the spice mixture which added an extra little something. The only other difference I made was the oven temp. I heated my oven to 380 degrees, let it sit as stated and then reheated again at 380 for 45 minutes instead of 30 minutes because we like our meat just a bit more well done than most. Even with my modification of the temp and timing it still could have been a little more cooked but I have to say that it was absolutely awesome. Any less cooked and we couldn't have eaten it but that's just us so I'm glad I decided to modify it. Next time I'll probably reheat it for an hour but again, it was really great!

Worked good.  We left it in the oven a bit longer after the 2nd baking.  It was just a tad too rare for my liking.  But---overall very good.  This is the way my entire family makes a prime rib.

Follow everything as stated and you will have a truly delicious rib roast.  I had a 5 rib standing roast that weighed 12.5 lbs.  The ONLY thing I did differently was to sliver a clove of fresh garlic and place the pieces in small slits I made in the meat.  The recipe worked like a charm and was so awesome!  Everyone raved!

Without a doubt 5 stars and the easiest recipe you'll ever make. We got ( my sons and I ) a round of applause from our family and guests. A 10 lb boneless PR that melted in your mouth.and cooked perfectly medium rare.

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't make a single change.  This was my very first prime rib and it was amazing.  The table pronounced it 'restaurant worthy!

This is a HIT!!! on our Christmas Dinner. Everybody love IT. The changes I made is using Sirloin Beef Roast instead of Rib Roast because in China, it's not easy to get Rib Roast if you didn't order 1 week before. And, I used parsley-garlic powder. Thanks SALSIEPIE ;)

We cook prime rib every Christmas but this one topped the charts. We were a bit hesitent at first, but figured what the heck & gave it a try. What a juicy roast! Simple yet effective system - the salt/flour shell locks in the flavor.

Better have everything else your serving cooking on the stovetop or your microwave.  Your meat cooking will have to change otherwise.  If you happen to have double ovens, this is a great way to cook your prime rib.  Traditional roasting works just as well in my opinion.

This recipe is wonderful and one my southern family has used for generations! It never fails to please and I've followed the basics and passed it on to friends too many times to count. For those who have deducted stars because Paula Deen has also put it on her site and probably in her cookbooks, this is a recipe which MANY southern cooks have had in their recipe files! No criticism to Paula Deen! She, like my family (in Tennessee), has used and passed on this delightful recipe. The only real difference is the seasonings (we all have our favorites) and the use of a thermometer. My family always uses a thermometer because, honestly, very few ovens are really accurate and some can be as much as 25 to 30 degrees off which will dramatically affect the results!
But this recipe, when the directions are followed and the oven temp is correct, is a show-stopper!!
If you haven't tried it - DO! It's absolutely fabulous!

I followed this to the letter on a 6.5 lb roast and it turned out perfect!! Melt in your mouth perfect! Some people questioned a gas stove, but that's what I cooked it in.

I make this recipe exactly and it comes out perfect every time. My family request this all the time especially around Christmas time. Delicious!!!!! One of the reviewers said that Paula Deen's recipe call for a cup of seasoning but it only calls for 1TBS the house seasoning to keep on hand is about 1 cup.

We followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only difference was the weight.  We had a 6 lb roast.  We had to cook it an additional hour to reach the correct internal temperature.  Dinner was delayed but it still tasted great.

YOU CAN PRE COOK IT AND LEAVE ANY SIZE ROAST UP TO 7 or 8 hrs.
BEFORE SERVING.
TURN OVEN TO 300 degrees
REHEAT: FOR MED RARE
1-2 RIBS 25 MIN
3-4 RIBS 35-40 MIN

Super Easy- basically it is a "set it & forget it" in your oven! I made a 3 pound roast, put garlic bulbs into the roast. It actually stayed in as directed for 3 hours and did not dry out.  This is the only was I will make roasts in the future.

This recipe worked out fantastically for me!  I was thrilled that it did because the the prime rib that I purchased cost $16.99 a pound (10 pounds).  I certainly did not want to ruin it!

Fantastic.  I had a 4.5 pound roast and only let it "sit" in the oven after turning off the heat for 2 hours before turning it back on for about 25 minutes.  It was perfect!

As the recipe says - Foolproof. I cooked a 4 bone Rib roast (10-15 lbs) it came out perfect. My company raved about the tenderness and just the right amount of pinkness.

I didn't think this would work.  It did and it tasted wonderful.  It was actually a bit overcooked for me.  Was closer to medium than medium rare and I like my Prime Rib rare.  The simple seasoning worked great.

This is the greatest and easiest recipe since sliced bread.  Even my husband prepared it for his family while visiting them and they now think he is a gourmet chef.  We have used it on a small 3 lb roast up to a 9 lb roast and they were both wonderful.

One of the best meat recipes ever!  At first I was very hesitant of the method of cooking, but it was perfect and really foolproof.  I have made this twice now and loved it both times.  It is definitely going to replace my slow cooked recipe with the mushroom soup.  This is a lot healthier too and the seasonings are yummy.  P.S.--I added a teaspoon of cumin and fresh diced garlic to the meat.  And instead of regular salt I use Kosher salt.  I poked holes in it and made sure I rubbed inside all the holes too so that the flavor could really soak in.  My two year-old even kept asking for more.  It was AMAZING!

Easy, and tender/juicy - if you follow directions exactly.  Bought a 3 lb roast and cut cooking time to 2 hr 15 min - perfect!

This recipe TERRIFIED me and stressed me out! The inability to open the oven was difficult. I just wanted to check the temp but resisted. I was so worried it would turn out dry but it was perfect! The roast was rare in the middle (the way my mother in law likes it) and medium to medium well towards the edges! When I took the roast out I thought I had burned it because it was dark and crusty but it was perfect! I used Montreal steak seasoning and the flavor was great! It is an inconvenience to have your oven out of commission but I planned my meal accordingly so I didn't have anything else to cook in there!

How wonderful for someone who has never cooked a rib roast!  So easy and my husband couldn't get over how tender it was and how good it tasted.  I might lessen the salt just a little as I'm not much of a salt eater (my husband is) but it's so good just as it is, I'll probably keep following the exact recipe!  Thank you so much

Delicious! Cooked with a 7 lb roast.  The middle was medium rare (a little too close to rare for some guests).  We served it with a mushroom gravy and a horseradish sauce.

Absolutely perfect exactly as instructed.  Hardest part was keeping hubby from opening the door.  The crust was heaven.  Served on New Years Eve with garlic mashed potatoes.  Will make again...when I can afford the meat.

I served 2-6ish lb rib roast for my Christmas dinner this year, and they turned out wonderfully! Spices I used were as recipe calls for plus some dried rosemary. I planned ahead of time to use this recipe, heance the rest of my meal was planned for stovetop cooking to accomadate the oven being tied up all day.It was worth it! Will use this  recipe again and again for the special occasion dinners. Thanks SALSIEPIE.

I did an 8.1 Lb. roast: Left out an hour before cooking, cooked for 1 hour 10 minutes at 375. Turned oven off for 3 hours 30 minutes and reheated at 375 for 35 minutes.  It was a perfect, juicy, medium-cooked roast and the best Christmas dinner ever. Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper.

I used this cooking method to cook a 5lb Rib Roast. Though I used Tyler Florence's Horseradish Rib Roast Recipe for ingredients.  I cooked 1 hour @ 375, turned off oven for 2 hours, then turned oven back to 375 for 20 min.  The 5 lb roast was perfectly med rare in middle and the ends were med (perfect for mother-in-law).  I let meat sit for 15 min before cutting. Scrape salt/horseradish cape off also before cutting.  Served w/ Horseradish Sauce from this website.

this year was my first Christmas with my husband and my first being in charge of the whole dinner and it could not have been more perfect! great roast with great leftovers for sandwiches! when i make it again (and you better be sure that i'm making it again) i will add a little beef stock and red wine to the bottom of the pan. the roast itself did not yield as much juice for au jus as i would have liked. definitely a  winner and a crowd pleaser!

Pull it at an internal temperature of 115 and let rest for 20 mins. It will be perfect medium rare in the center gradually going to medium on the end pieces.

What a great way to do up an expensive cut of meat, where there is no room for error. My family has 4 birthdays in October, plus Canadian Thanksgiving so we combine the Celebrations into one day. While I appreciate Turkey for it's healthy eating benifits, none of us are fans of it's taste, or lack there of. I would so rather have an amazing cut of beef, when it comes to flavour. I splured on a 7 rib prime rib roast. When you are looking at a just under $100 cut of meat you panic. This method of cooking worked like a charm, the adult members, 10 of them, RAVED! All but my husband love beef rare (so his I microwaved for a minute to make it grey,hugh but he was happy:) The youngest granddaughter, 22 months, eat her's all up. I found for rare, I only needed to cook at the last for 20 minutes, not the 1 hour. I also rubed the roast with a mixture of herbs du Provence and olive oil, prior to roasting. Wonderful!!!!

Sorry folks, I dont get it. This will not work according to the recipe in my stove. I let the 3.5 lb roast come to room temp for two hours solid. I used a remote thermometer to read internal temp and found it to be 43 degrees after the two hours. I then assumed that it would never warm up and inserted it into the oven. The meat was clearly at room temp on the surface. I oiled and applied rub an placed in a WELL preheated 375 degree oven. I dropped the temp from 500 degrees upon insertion. I cooked for exactly one hour and turned the oven off. As you know the temp will climb after removal from stove or after turning the stove off. I did not open the oven door. While keeping watch on Mr Roast I observed the temp climbing ever higher. When the temp read 154 degrees I thought I had better do something. I removed the roast and found it to be cooked to medium rare through 60 percent of it. The other 40 percent was medium. There were no rare areas. The conclusion is that had I left it for the prescribed three hours and then reheated it, it would have been way overdone. Maybe it was the weight of my roast and if so the chef needs to be aware of that. The three stars is for what I consider to be a lack of warning on meat weight. Assuming of course that that was the problem. I recommend buying a thermometer that has a lead that is inserted into the meat and a reader on the outside of the oven. In the future I will cook my roast until 125 read out and pull from the oven.

Amazing!!!  I made this for Easter dinner.  I was hesitant, because I didn't want to mess up our dinner.  But I tried it anyways.  WOW...it was perfect..just absolutely perfect.  And stress free.  I didn't have to think about it for 3 hours....or worry about having to watch it so I don't over cook it.  Great recipe.  Only change I made was in the seasoning.  I took the stated salt, black pepper and garlic powder, to that I added about 6 garlic gloves crushed.  Mixed them together and added enough vegetable oil to make a paste.  I smeared this onto the roast.

Did not turn out like all the other reviews! May needed to extend 2nd cooking?  I did put it back into the oven sliced up abit to help it cook longer.  Was wondering did others put a lid on?  And my oven doesn't have a great seal.... would that make a difference?  I would still try this recipe again, only adjust cooking times and shorten rest time.

My Roast turned out great!! It was so tender and delicious. As I was cutting it to put it on the plates my husband was standing behind me and both of our mouths were watering. It was so flavorful and the left overs were even better!!

Excellent! Used a meat thermometer and positioned roast so I could read it through the oven window. My husband likes his prime rib RARE so I took it out after the temp came back up to 125-130 on the second cooking (about 20 minutes). This is the easiest recipe ever and the result was perfect!

I've made this at least 3 times now with consistently fantastic results.  I use the seasoning recipe from Restaurant style prime rib roast (recipe on this site), halved to accommodate a roughly 5 lb roast.  Not only have I used this on beef brisket and rump roast, but I've done this recipe using a butterflied/ boneless leg of lamb too.  When cooking I have the meat sealed in a foil packet- like in the old Reynolds wrap commercials.  I've never had it come out too dry or undercooked.  I think the key to success is letting the meat sit out (before unwrapping it) for the prescribed time, cooking it as directed, and KEEPING THE OVEN CLOSED for the full three hour rest period.

I'll admit I was skeptical, but I made this for our Chirstmas Eve dinner party.  The day before, I infused the roast with garlic and made a paste of oil, garlic, and parsley to layer on top. On the big day I let the roast come to room temperature and then put it in the oven. I followed the instructions and I didn't peek but I did have my fingers crossed.  It  was perfect!  I have always seared the meat before putting it in the oven (what a pain) and I will never do it that way again since finding this recipe.

I doubt I will ever use another recipe. I may change the seasoning a bit but the cooking instructions are perfection.

10 stars! I was skeptical with the minimal ingredients & the cooking instructions but really amazed how great it turned out. I sprinkled fresh rosemary for aroma. It's IMPORTANT to have a meat thermometer.  For the price of the meat, it's worth the purchase since the meat comes in different weights.  The final cooking time really depends on the thermometer readout.  Medium-well is 145F.  I'm thinking of doing it again for New Year's eve.

I have been making this for years and have always been thrilled with the results. It does not matter if you have a large (entire rib roast) or small roast, it turns out perfect every time without varying the cooking time. As others have stated, the key is not to open the oven door. We prefer out meat rare, so I always pull the roast after cooking the additional 30 minutes.

UN-BEE-LEE-VUH-BULL!!  This was truly the EASIEST and most delicious rib roast I have ever had!  I felt confident that there was no need to worry about the unusual cooking time after reading so many successful reviews, so I busted out my E.V.O.O. and my Montreal Steak Seasoning and rubbed them into my roast and did exactly what the recipe said to do - and all I can say is...PERFECTION!!  Mine actually came out of the oven registering an internal temp of just over 155 degrees, but I let it rest and when it was time to eat, realized that any less than that would have been too rare for me.  Our roast was a perfect medium...and talk about tender and juicy!  There were no pan drippings whatsoever, but that's because all the juice stayed in the meat!  Served this with creamy horshradish and all the fixin's and it was a perfect Christmas dinner.   I will never make rib roast any differently!  Thank you for sharing this incredible recipe!!

. I remember this recipe from 20 years ago.  I saw how people where upset because they thought this was Paula Dean's recipe, actually it isn't.  It is from Ms. Wilks restaurant in Savannah.  FYI, many of Paula's recipes aren't originals they came from the old ladies who actually did majority of the cooking in her restaurant in Savannah, :Lady and Sons". She uses other people recipes but she doesn't always give them credit.  I am sure Ms. Wilks got this recipe from someone eles.  By the way the rib roast was excellent! If you were to ask Paula Dean where she got the recipe, if she is honest she's honest, she'll tell you from someone eles.

Absolutely the easiest way to make a rib roast. Simplest is always the best.  I did add an herb mix from penzeys as part of the crust.  I timed my rolls to be ready to go into the oven when the meat came out to rest before carving and it all came off beautifully. I'll never make my roast any other way from now on. Thanks Salsiepie

I'm guessing that leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed as it cools allows the meat to re-absorb the moisture and makes for a juicy and tender experience,right??? If so, I can't wait to make this, my mouth is watering as I write this!!! Bye, I'm off to the store :-)

I was a doubter but trusted the rave reviews and it didn't disappoint!    Served with roasted red baby potatoes, ceasar salad and and an orange fluff salad.  The plate was beautiful and the meal was amazing with an easy, wonderful anchor of prime rib roast!

This is the only way I do a rib roast now.  I bought a boneless rib roast for the h's birthday (read the label wrong) and cooked as directed.  Came out perfectly!!!  Love this one!  Thanks.

Sooooooo delicious! We bought a 3.14lb prime rib roast and I did as told, for the first bit, but turned it down to 250 for 1.5hrs for the second and it was a PERFECT medium rib! Oh, and we had no garlic powder, so I made 5 slits thoughout the rib, and inserted whole cloves of garlic into them... last but not least I added a tbsp of rosemary to the rub....literally drooled while it was roasting, and the hubby took one bite and asked when I could get another rib! Thanks so much!

De-lish!  I roasted it uncovered and used fresh pressed garlic instead of powder.  I was pressed for time, so I roasted at 375 for 1hr 30min, turned off and left it in for an hour and then turned it back on for 15min. It was perfect:)

This made our home grown rib roast so tender-juicy on the inside and seasoning-crusty on the outside. I had great praise in my kitchen when I served this simple roast. The reheat time is perfect for adding a pan of red potatoes roasted in olive oil.

Absolutely awesome!  We 'stole'from one of the other 5-star Prime Rib recipies, stud it with garlic & rubbed it with dijon mustard - outstanding!  Next time we'll add rosemary to the mustard - we know it'll be a sure winner!

This was wonderful.  Only had a 2 1/2 pound roast, so cut down on time, but it really came out great.  Son who is very picky about his meat loved it.  I did have to open oven for last 30 min to add potatoes, but it still came out with the best flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, will definately make again.

I was nervous about making a prime rib roast for my husband's birthday tonight - especially because the meat was so expensive and didn't want to ruin it in front of his family.  But the prime rib was as good as our favorite steak restaurant here in Nebraska.  Thank you  for a fantastic/special meal.

Thank you!Thank you!Thank you! Finally a Christmas dinner success. I've tried so many different recipes for rib roast and this one tops them all. It turned out perfect. Everyone enjoyed it, including my "no red showing" husband. I followed the recipe as instructed, although I was tempted once or twice to open the oven, but I'm glad I waited. The roast tasted fantastic! The only thing missing was the au jous.

I read the reviews and followed the diretions EXACTLY and NEVER opened the oven door and for the first time my prime rib was spectacular! It was totally gone by the end of the meal and it's now a tradional favorite for christmas dinner. You can not mess this up as long as you make sure to tape the oven door so no one is tempted to peek!!!!

I had originally found this recipe on Paula Dean's website.  It was delicious--and smelled superb while cooking.  I used an electronic meat thermometer--cooked until it was 145.  Was just right.  Roast was only 4 pounds so it took less time to cook.  Will definitely make again!

If I could give it 6 stars, I would!  Made this on Xmas day - the first time I ever attempted prime rib in all my years of cooking.  It was the best Xmas dinner I ever made.  People raved all night.  I was nervous throughout the whole cooking process - was not sure it was cooking at all when the oven was off, and thought it was cooking too much when the oven was on.  Anyway, it turned out PERFECT!  If you can manage to keep your oven door closed the whole time, it will register a perfect 145 degrees, which is medium rare, the way we like it.  Only wish I could afford to make it more often!

I think my 9 pound roast was too big to get cooked enough by this method. We wound up cooking slices in the microwave so we wouldn't have to serve it bloody. It did taste good. I would try this method again with a 2 rib instead of a 4 rib roast.

okay i used the recipe for garlic prime rib, but utilized this method of cooking. DON'T BE AFRAID!! i used a tablespoon of olive oil, some beef baste, pepper and minced garlic. scored the fat and rubbed it all in, let it set for half hour or so.  it was all i could do to keep from opening the oven, but due to other reviews i did not. i had some picky eaters for christmas, and nobody complained, only the inlaw who wanted his piece cooked a little longer. it was nice and pink, yum! i strained out the garlic pieces and made gravy with the drippings. i did add water when i turned the oven on the second time. trust me, it turned out wonderful!! i was skeptical, beings i cannot afford to throw food away.

I will have to rate this when it is done but wanted to add a bit of thought here.....prep time should show 1 hour 5 mins....as stated to let the roast set out for 1 hour before putting in the oven

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and like many of the other reviewers I was quite skeptical.......BUT I was pleasantly surprised at the results!  I have not made many Prime Rib dinners because I was always scared to ruin such an expensive cut of meat but I am no longer afraid.  This was AMAZING!!!!  I got rave reviews from my family and this is now the only way I will ever make a Prime Rib again and there will be many, many more of them.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  BTW, I didn't change a thing except that I used Montreal Steak Seasoning as the rub.  I also left it in an addtional 10m minutes at the end because we like ours medium and it was perfect!

Excellent, I have always tended to over cook roasts, but not with this one. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect for me, (rare). I think I would cook it abit longer during the first cooking if it were a larger roast or if some of the people who were eating it did not care for rare.

Like so many others I was afraid of turning it off then back on. I had an 8lb standing rib roast but followed the recipe but cooked for 1 hour after turning back on and it was perfect. Medium rare in the middle and somewhere just short of medium well near the edges and ends. I used pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and steak seasoning for the rub the night before. It had a beautiful crispy crust on the outside that I didn't really think it would have. This is not a meat I cook often due to the price but I'll surely use this method again next time.

I make this all the time.  I only go to 300f for the last 1/2 hour.  You need to have at least 5 lb roast if more than 8 lb add another 15 min at the end

Been using this method for a few years. I would recommend using a remote probe thermometer however.  Simply relying on time in the oven can lead to under cooking if your roast is not completely defrosted. But the taste is outstanding and your rare beef lovers will be very pleased with the result.

I cooked as the recipe noted with one exception, I added some dried onion flakes for that flavor to the butter spread.
I LOVE bone-in Rib Eye and this was the best I have ever had.  So simple, so good!

I pretty much followed the recipe as-is. However, the one thing I did not see, and which caused me some confusion was with the re-heat of the roast, as I could not find it noted anywhere if the time starts when you restart the oven, or after the pre-heat. Based on my experience it's after the reheat, as when I took the roast out the first time is was not quite ready.  Hope this helps someone else.

I used this method for Christmas 2018 using a 9.8 lb bone in rib roast from Costco.  The only thing I chose to do differently was to increase the initial cooking time by an additional 30 minutes.  Other than that, followed the rest of the directions as written.  It was perfect— we like ours rare/medium rare.

I made this last night. I cooked a 4.5 bone in roast and followed the directions exactly. I was a bit nervous about the method, but read the reviews and decided to try it. It was absolutely PERFECT. It took 12 minutes for my oven to reheat to 375 after 3 hours of being off. Once it reached 375, I cooked it for another 40 minutes. It was perfectly pink and delicious.
I did add 1t rosemary to the rub. So easy and so good. This is the first time I have reviewed a recipe on this site. This one really deserved it.

My sister bought a spectacular dry-aged roast, and I was a little nervous about trying this (new to me) technique. It came out perfectly! I second guessed myself about the timing because my roast was a little over 8 lbs, and the recipe was for a 5 lb roast. I added about 20 minutes to the first round of cooking (so a total of 1 hr 20 min). Then at the end the meat temp was less than 130, so I cooked it for about 10 extra minutes then. I tented the roast with foil while I was making my gravy & Yorkshire Pudding (~30 min). By the time I carved, the roast was closer to medium than medium rare, so the next time I make this I'll trust the timing!

The "tip" about aluminium foil implies that you should cover the meat with foil before cooking, which is a DEFINITE NO-NO, and it didn't say whether to keep the meat in the oven while the oven heats BACK up to temperature (I did).  I also stuck the temperature probe in and just left it while the meat cooked to 135... my "second roasting time" was 1h 15m, but it was also a 6lb roast. I wouldn't say it came out perfect, but it was darn close. I've NEVER cooked prime rib before (my wife did all the cooking for 35 years, now it's my turn to cook for her), but this was so simple that I have NO problems doing it again. For a rub I used 2 TB of salt, and 1 TB each of pepper and garlic powder. Nothing else. I'll experiment with the rub next time, but not the cooking directions. And ignore the "baking time"... bake by internal temperature. But that's common sense.

I used fresh garlic and a drop or two of XV olive oil to rub the roast all over. Sea salt and coarsely fresh ground pepper have a nice crunch with the crispy garlic.

I have been making this recipe for about 14 years now. It was a recipe I got from Paula Deen. I have used every size roast up to 20 pounds using the same method. It turns out perfect every time! Highly recommend it, especially for the holidays.

It was very tender and juicy. 
I’m not sure the full three hours of “off time” is necessary.  After 2.5 hours, the temperature started dropping so it wasn’t cooking. Next time I plan to turn the oven back on at that point.

I am glad I found this recipe, or rather detailed directions , for properly cooking a rib roast.  I made it once with a bone in roast, and made another time with a boneless one (they only seem to sell the racks around the holidays around here).  It came out great both times.

I had a 6.5 lb ribeye roast. I let it sit for 2 hours prior to cooking. Then I mixed together:

1/3 cup dijon mustard
2 T minced garlic
1 T choppped thyme
2 teaspoons pepper
2 teaspoons salt
3 T olive oil

Rub the mix on the outside. Place meat thermometer in the middle of the roast (from the side). Place in the oven at 375 for 1 hour and then turned the oven off. It was in the oven for another 2 hours until it got to 125. I had to take it out as it did not take as long as I thought it would. It cooled to 112 before I put it back into the 375 oven, and it took almost an hour to get back to up to 125. I took it out and let it rest for 30 minutes and it got to 135. It was extremely tender and tasty! When I do it again I will take it out at 120 (it still was pink in the middle, but was heading towards being too done) and let it rest for a little longer.

12/2018
This year I had a 5 1/5 pound ribeye roast. It took 2 hours and 15 minutes to get done (1 hour with the oven on and 1:15 with it off). I took it out when it got 120 but after 45 minutes under the aluminum foil tenting it got to 129. This made it right at medium. I could have left it to 122 or 123 to get a longer cook time in the oven and get a little more cook. But 129 for my thermometer made it medium. Much better than last year. I made this for 6 adults this year but would recommend more meat for that many people.  At least 6 1/2 to 7 lbs for 6 people. And more salt on the outside of the roast before cooking.

I have made this rib roast twice now and it turns out perfect!  I was terrified to try it thinking I was going to ruin a very expensive piece of meat, but I will never cook it any other way.  I had a 5 rib roast, about 8 lbs.  took it out of the fridge at 8:00 am.  Put it in the oven at 11:30 at 375, after generously salting, peppering, garlic powdering.  Bake for 1 hour, turn oven off for 3 hours, back on for 45 mins, rest for 1/2  or more, perfection. Medium rare, all the juice stays in the meat!  Just don't open the oven door!  Enjoy!

I used this recipe to make a 10 lb  rib roast for Christmas dinner. The roast was perfectly done, med rare in the center and a little more towards medium at the ends.  This gave my family a nice choice of meats.  

I was apprehensive about the method but I thought that I would give it a try since it did not involve ultra high smoky temperatures at the outset.  It worked like a charm.  It took about 45 minutes during the final roasting to bring the internal temperature up to 140.

I like the idea of a meat thermometer with an external monitor.  That would have eased my anxiety during the roasting and waiting times.

Fantastic--worked just as said. I was a little concerned. This is the  first time that I have cooked this type of roast and it was for a Christmas Eve dinner. In the past I have always cooked a tenderloin because no matter what, it is hard to screw up a tenderloin.  However, my mother-in-law insisted on this type of roast this year because she felt it would go better with her Yorkshire putting.  I used a 10-lb boneless rib roast. As another reviewer did, I let the roast sit out overnight so it would be room temperature. Even though it sat out from 10pm til 10am, it was still cool to the touch when I prepared it for the oven. I cooked it for 1 hour at 400 turned the oven off, and watched the temperature rise to 140 over the next 3 hours. I then took it out of the oven and took it over to my MIL's where it sat out for 3 hours  befor being put into a 375 oven and reheated for 40 minutes. It was absolutely perfect.  The only thing I would do differently in the future is do two smaller roasts instead of one big one so that one could be more done as we have a fair amount of people who like their meat barely pink while the rest like it medium rare which is how this turned out.

Today marks the first day in history that I have ever ruined a roast following this recipe!! We had a 9.4lb roast, and I followed everything to the T! I was actually worried the roast wouldn't be done in time. Checked it after letting it rest and it is beyond well done! It would have been nice to know that the recipe was intended to be cooked that way. I left the oven closed 2.5 hours after I turned the oven off and then the last half hour I turned it back on to 375 for the last half hour. Pulled it out after the timer, checked it and it is beyond well done! I'm just fuming! I'm going to stick to how I've always cooked my roasts in the past - THAT is foolproof and in 15 years I've never once had a botched job.

I made this with a 3 lb. roast, cut the cooking time down to 30 minutes, let rest in the oven for an hour. Turned the oven back on as instructed but for only 15 minutes. Never peaked and had to ban my husband from going in the kitchen. I did add a little rosemary and more garlic for our taste. I only have one complaint.... it was not rare enough so next time I will reduce the time standing in the oven as well as the reheat time. Over all it was easy and painless.

I made a rib roast this Christmas as an alternative to turkey. Purchased a 5 pound rib roast as recipe calls for and followed it to the letter. This roast was absolutely fabulous!!! My family just devoured it and said "it was the best Christmas meal I had ever made and could we have this every Christmas"!! Needless to say this will be making a repeat performance next Christmas!!

I cooked my prime rib following this recipe every Christmas ,this cooks the perfect standing rib roast. Do use a meat thermometer to get the perfect  amount of desired temp and rareness. Served with an awesome horseradish sauce, twice baked potatoes, brussel sprouts and tossed salad.

Unbelievable!! To say I was skeptical about this method is an under-understatement! On the one hand I was swayed heavily by the sheer number of stellar reviews. I mean THAT many positive reviews can't be wrong, right? But, on the other hand, there  was a very expensive cut of beef at stake not to mention the disappointment and embarrassment that would befall me should it not go well. I was already in the hot seat due to a failed prime rib situation last year due to an oven that had become 25° too hot and needed to be recalibrated which I wasn't aware of until the roast was sliced and there was nothing rarer than medium to med-well.  I made sure that wasn't going to happen again and took the necessary steps to calibrate my oven to the nth degree.This year I had to redeem myself so what do I do? I decide to go with an unorthodox, sketchy method that no one I knew had ever heard of. Let's just say there were a lot of people with raised eyebrows at my house and the roast was in the last stages of the routine.

I and everyone who was privy to the method I used was absolutely amazed and delighted at the results! It was absolutely fantastic. There is no way I could have cooked it to make it taste or look better. I followed the directions to the letter with regard to the cooking method. I did, however, alter the recipe just a little. I made a paste out of 1 cup coarse Kosher salt, 1/4 cup coarse ground black pepper, 1/2 cup of Rosemary and 1/4 cup of olive oil which I applied to the

I've been doing a form of this for YEARS and it works fine BUT I have several changes. First I use Garlic Powder, Paprika, Tarragon, Tyme and Chervil along with salt and pepper for the rub. I use a bone in roast cut away from the chine and also let the roast stand while mixing my rub spices with a bit of olive oil to make a paste. I then coat the roast with this paste inside and outside. I turn the oven to 500 and, with the roast in the roasting pan fat side up, I let it in for 12 to 15 minutes a pound depending on how rare I want it. I then turn the oven OFF and do the rest of my meal while the roast sits for 1 to 1.5 hours. It comes out PERFECTLY every time! For those of you who tried this and it didn't work, I've no clue what you did wrong but I've never had a failure, only effusive praise. In fact, I've cooked it for a friend who is a chef in a VERY upscale restaurant and he begged me for the recipe.

I have made  prime rib this way for over 30 years. I got the recipe from my sister-in-law. Now my daughters use this recipe at Christmas. It does matter if the roast is larger than a three bone or a small two bone. I just adjust the cooking time. I don't like my meat as rare as I used to so I start it at 425 degrees for 25 mins then down to 375 for 35 Mins. After resting for three hours I cook it about 45  mins or more if it is a four bone roast which I sometimes find on sale. I use only granulated garlic on the outside while roasting. It turns out perfect, and we have another gorgeous Christmas roast!

This is a tried and true recipe we used at our bar & grill for many years.  We cooked hundreds of prime ribs  this way. The only thing I would add is to have a pan of Aujus simmering on the stove when you are ready to serve.  That way you can dip the slice of roast into the hot aujus and serve.  If someone wants a more medium or well done piece, just leave it in the Aujus for a few minutes.

I made this last year.  I followed directions exactly and roast was raw in the middle when I cut into it. Not pink or even red, I am talking the same color it was in the butcher's case.  Too expensive of a cut to try this again.

Chef John on this site says 500 degrees for 5 mins per lb. then 2 hrs with oven off. The size of the roast is crucial in determining how long 
the meat cooks @ the high heat. Perfect everytime.

This is amazing. I had never tried cooking a short rib roast before, this recipe made it so easy. The cut of beef was so moist, and tasteful. This is now  my favorite cut of roast beef.

My 6 lb roast reached "rare" in just over 2 hours. Unfortunately, my guests had not arrived.  I did open the oven and then re-heated.

I have tried this recipe several times and I first  thought are they crazy! The truth is when you turn off the oven it is still hot enough to keep on cooking. This is really fool proof and delicious. I let it stand at room temperature before cooking for 1 hr then I  rubbed with a little olive oil and rosemary.

I am not a big fan of cooking roast, so I must say I was very apprehensive about this recipe.  Tried this for a family dinner a few Christmas' back and it was wonderful!!  I will admit the whole idea of turning the oven off and on was intimidating but the roast came out perfect and has become a favorite!!

Fantastic!  Prime rib is one of the most wonderful things ever and I was terrified to try my hand at preparing such an expensive roast.  However, with the help of this recipe I now consider myself an expert.  Letting the roast stand until room temperature all the way through was wise advice.  My only recommendation would be to get a good meat thermometer with a probe that allows you to monitor the meat accurately while it's in the oven...then you don't have to open the door until completely finished.  Have another roast planned for our Super Bowl party!  Many many thanks for posting!!!  :-)

Made this with a family member on Christmas day and it turned out great.  We were a little apprehensive about the approach as we had a 9lb roast which cost $$.  Needless to say the end result was very good.  We followed the directions exactly.  It was VERY HARD to not open the oven but willpower prevailed.

Worked like a charm on my 8.5 lb rib roast (I doubled the seasoning, which got crusty and wonderful).  If I were doing a smaller roast, I would be careful with cooking times, possibly reducing them a bit, just to be sure I didn't overcook it!

I use this recipe every Christmas.  We pull our 5-6 lb. roast out when the internal temp reaches about 130-135 degrees keeping in mind the carryover cooking that occurs.  The temperature will come up quite a bit just sitting on the cutting board, resting, covered in foil.  This usually means there are 2 slices on each end at "well-done," a slice or two at "medium-well," and the rest "medium" to "medium-rare." I also use my "convection-bake" mode for even, dry cooking all around the roast.  It's beautiful every time!
NOTE: If you are able to check the calibration of your oven, do so before attempting this.  I'm thinking some of the negative reviews I have read have to do with an oven not correctly registering temperature.

I used the rub and it had great flavor. I, too, was very nervous to make it this way, but I followed the directions. I just got confused when the 3 hrs were up and it was time to turn the oven back on....was I supposed to start timing it for 30 minutes after the oven reached 375? It took about 40 minutes for the oven to get to that temp. I have an oven that has the meat thermometer built in, and set it for 125. I took it out when it reached 125, that took another 30 minutes. I wrapped it with foil, and let it rest for a half hour. It turned out perfectly! The middle was very rare ( just how my family likes it), and the outer portion was medium rare (just the way my guests liked it).

I was amazed at how juicy and tender the roast was using this recipe. I was a bit skeptical, as other users mentioned, but I have become a believer! A truly awesome recipe. My husband bought us a 5.2 lb boneless roast to have for Christmas Eve meal with our son and his wife. Because it was a bit over 5 lbs and wasn't quite at room temperature, I chose to cook it a bit longer than 1 hour for the first cooking (1.5 hrs). The crust of seasonings on top was awesome, but the interior meat wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. Next time I will put slices of garlic in slits in the meat (as my mother taught me many years ago), that should give it some flavor. I was saddened that there were no meat juices in the bottom of the pan to make au jus, but the next day I made au jus from bullion and that gave it the flavor it needed. Thanks for a great recipe.

Did this for Christmas and it came out perfectly. A a 6 lb roast, cooked it for 1 hr 10 min, shut oven off for 3 hours and after that, baked for another 30-45 min. Ends were perfect for the well done contingent and rest was perfect for the rest of us. Next time I'll add rosemary just to try it. Can't go wrong with this.

I was so happy to find this recipe. A 9 pound roast came out perfectly for our Christmas dinner.  I did take the suggestion of others to let the larger roast sit at room temperature a half hour longer prior to cooking.  I also used the meat thermometer for the second turn-on of the oven, when I also added my prepped side dishes to oven for completion.

I read through the reviews this morning and decided to give this recipe a try. 1st of all my roast was on the small side, so I decided to scale back the cooking time. I did invest in a digital probe thermometer ( a very wise investment)I had a 2.5 pound prime rib roast, I brought the roast to 60 degrees, I set the oven for 375 degrees, inserted the thermometer probe and set the timer for 30 minutes. Shut the oven off and watched the thermometer temp. I set mine for 140 degrees. Once it reached that, I took it out of the oven and tented it with foil. The cook time was much faster then I expected, 30 minutes with the oven shut off. The prime rib came out as medium rare. It was delicious!! I did rub steak seasoning on the top and sides before baking it. AGAIN this was a small prime rib roast, and it was boneless. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I made this yesterday for our Christmas dinner.  This was the first time in our 44 years of marriage that we had attempted to cook a standing rib roast (and we love to cook :).  It turned out AWESOME!!  Followed recipe as written.  So easy.  Only downside is--the oven is basically tied up all day cooking the roast so need to find alternative dishes/methods that don't need the use of the oven (i.e., slow cooker, microwave).  Thank you SO MUCH for posting!!  This is now our fav new Christmas dinner treat!!

DH bet me this couldn't work b/c of the 3 hr @ zero temp.  We don't eat rare meat so when the meat came out after the re-heat Looking mostly red, he was gloating.  Despite my uncertainty, I sliced and served and guess what:  it was out of this world.  Though meat was red, it was cooked, not chewy raw.   DH had to concede and has requested I NEVER use another recipe--I solemnly swore I will only use this recipe

My first attempt at cooking a 5.3lb prime rib roast. I followed the recipe, tho I mixed in dry mustard & some Italian herbs w/olive oil to smeared onto the meat. I baked it for the required hour @375. I turned off my oven. It's a new oven with a fan that cools it down. I left it closed for 2 1/2 hrs. Shorting the time by 30mn., then turned the oven back to 375 for another 30min. The oven temp screen showed it was currently holding a temp of 160-so new ovens will keep a low temp in spite of the fan.I worried that my small roast, 5.3lbs vs 6lbs & over might wind up over cooked if I left it for the whole 3hrs, then cooked it longer on top of that. I still thought I had messed up when I took it out because it looked so "done". 
The internal temp was 150 & I knew it would cook another 5-10 degrees!Next time I figured I would open the oven, check the temp & restart the oven at that point knowing how much longer I need to cook, if at all, to get that perfect roast-HOWEVER, even tho the first 2 slices were medium to medium well-which made my boyfriend happy. The next slice in was PERFECT. Pink, juicy, medium rare-this recipe is a keeper.

This was wonderful.  It worked perfectly following it as written. We found that that last part at 375 degrees brought us to rare after 30 minutes. I am definitely saving this recipe. THANK you!!

I have used this recipe before, slathering it with softened butter. It is delicious. Do not open that oven.

Amazing! I was so unsure about cooking my roast this way...I had fears that it would come out raw, but it was perfect! I cooked a 4 1/5 lb roast, and the end result was a beautiful roasted piece of meat that was cooked to medium all the way through!

Years ago I learned to make a delicious prime rib roast this way.  At that time, I had a gas oven.  When I moved to a home with an electric oven, I tried it and somehow it didn't turn out fully cooked.  My mother also tried it after my first time and she found it didn't work in her electric oven.  If I ever get a gas oven again, I'll make it this way as it really is fool proof!

One thing that I did do differently was rather than use garlic powder, I took garlic and cut little holes in the roast (prior to cooking) and stuck a clove into each of the holes.  I did this all around the roast.  It was fantastic!  When serving, I don't always (I still use this when making a roast) all of the garlic out, but if anyone gets it in their slice of meat, it is roasted garlic and delicious!

I tried this at Thanksgiving and it was absolutely perfect! Bonus points because I was staying at a condo for the holiday so the stove was unfamiliar but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. So tasty and moist, mmm. I'm making it again for Christmas.

I was nervous about this recipe as I have never made prime rib before. 
Holy smokes this was good! I over cooked it a bit but it was still very tasty. My boyfriend made me put a bottle of beer in the bottom of the pan and this sucker was good!

I tried this recipe with a 2 1/2 lb rib roast! More than Fantastic! Rubbed the roast down all over with olive oil, and then rubbed in McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasonings (saw this in another review here). Cut 1st cooking time down to 30 mins, waited about 2 hrs and then just turned the oven on for 20 additional minutes until the roast registered 140 degrees-Perfect. It was two generous servings but we still fought over the bones (don't waist these on the dog, one of the best parts).

Was a bit skeptical to do this with such an expensive roast but had great success with a similar method for eye of round. I rubbed the rib roast with olive oil and added some rosemary to the spice mixture. Cooking was so simple as I was able to put the roast in the oven and then go out to run errands during its sit time. Delicious, tender and perfectly colored throughout. Will definitely do again!

1st time and I was surely skeptical.  Had 3.5# rib roast without the bones.  Used the salt/pepper/ & granulated garlic with a bit extra garlic than called for along with some olive oil before the rub in.  After the one hour of roasting, I turned off the oven.  The internal temp got to the 140-145, so I was afraid the I might over coook it.  The internal temp dropped during the 3 hour period and the 30 minute warm up did not take it over the 145 temp.  I have to say that this was the best roast I have ever cooked, it will not be the last!

I made this for Easter dinner yesterday.It was FANTASTIC !! My roast was 5 pounds, I coated the roast with olive oil and added crushed rosemary to the rub. I also added a can of beef broth to the bottom of the pan. This is the best prime rib I have ever made! I recommend this recipe to anyone. The only thing I wasn't sure of was to cook covered or uncovered, and the answer was uncovered.

Fantastic,  I only had a small 2.5 lb, so cooked 45 min, shut oven off for two hours an re-heated.  Also added rosemary and thyme to the crust. Fabulous!!  My husband raved about it.

This rub is amazing and garnered highest praise from my family and in-laws.
Here are my notes/some tips:
Our thermometer got JUST to 145 and it was medium or medium-well.
At 20 mins after the oven shut off the temp was 104. It climbed to 144 by about 2 hours of shut-off time then dropped a tad bit. After turning the oven back on, the roast was in for 45 mins (30 mins at temp) - this was probably about 10 mins too long. The rub was AMAZING.

Followed the instructions to a T.  We had a 2.59-lb. roast.  The second round in the oven went about 40 minutes.  I think next time I will do about 35 minutes.  It was DELICIOUS!  My husband was really raving about it.  He loved it, and so did I!!

I agree with everyone who said to trust this recipe.  Ours turned out absolutely delicious and has become what everyone wants to have as our Christmas Day tradition.  I was skeptical that the seasonings would be enough to make it interesting but decided to follow the recipe exactly.  I'm so glad I did because it was perfect!  I did look up a recipe for making Au Jus without Drippings since this doesn't make enough drippings to make one.  I also made a horseradish sauce to go with it as well. (I have posted both recipes.)  I gave everyone two small dipping containers with au jus in one and the horseradish sauce in the other.  We all loved it.  As another person has cautioned this takes a lot of time when you add in the hour of resting at room temperature before putting it in the oven.  We like ours medium to medium well which I know is frowned upon by many...but hey, it's how we like it.  And it was delicious by the way, not dry at all.  So, for me the total time was about 6 1/2 hours from the time of taking it out of the oven until the time to slice it after it rests after cooking.  No matter what temperature you like your final product to be do not hesitate to try this recipe.  One other thing, I did buy my meat from Costco and I bought it boneless.  I debated over bone in or boneless but I'm glad I did the boneless because it was so easy to slice and serve.

Yes it did work! No one in my family thought this would turn out well but the (very expensive) Christmas 6-rib choice roast I cooked turned out perfect. I put blue masking tape on the oven door so no one would peek.

I have tried this recipe many times with a rib roast and a sirloin tip roast and it has turned out perfect every time. We enjoy our roast medium rare and this does it. the only different thing I do is, to start the over at 500F for 20 minutes - THEN turn it off and leave it for two hours without opening door.  Can't fail.  Shygal

LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!
This was my first prime rib and it was AMAZING!! This recipe really is foolproof, just set your timers and forget it! I used a 5lb rib eye roast(boneless). For the final cooking time I did about 45 minutes and it came out a perfect med. rare. I don't think I will ever try another recipe!

This was amazing!!!  My mother in law was coming to stay for a couple days, so I wanted to cook something nice...and impressive.  This made me a little nervous at first, but it turned out perfectly!!!  I put it in the oven and then ran errands.  We got home later than we had hoped, and the oven was actually off for almost 4 hours-so cooking time 1 hour, rested for 4 and it was still perfect!  I didn't have garlic powder, so I rubbed it down first with garlic paste, then rubbed with rosemary, salt and pepper.  Will definitely cook it this way from now on!

I've made this several times now, and each time it comes out perfect.  I do place foil over the meat prior to reheating, to keep the crust from over cooking.

This was SOOOOO easy. It turned out absolutely perfectly. The only thing I did any differently was rub button on the ends - which I got from another recipe. I don't know if that even made a difference. This was PERFECTLY cooked. So simple.

Will never do my roasts any other way! Made two roasts of different sizes and both turned out perfectly. the only extra thing I do is make slits around it and insert pieces of garlic inside.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came our perfect! Better than the prime rib at our favorite restaurant! We are making one about half the size so we are using the suggestions of another reviewer and cutting the cook time down, to make sure we don't get a dry overcooked prime rib!

This was perfect!  We had a 10 pound bone-in prime rib roast for Christmas.  I cooked it for 2 hours at the beginning because it was so much bigger than the recipe.  I am lucky that I have a meat thermometer probe built into my convection oven.  I shut it off after 2 hours.  The temp was about 100 degrees.  I let it sit in an unopened oven for another hour or so until the temp reached 145.  After it sat for a half hour or 45 minutes while i baked the bread etc. and warmed it bck up for 15 minutes.  It was perfectly pink, medium rare.  Thank you!

This recipe was amazing! At first I was afraid to try such an unusual way of cooking such an expensive cut of meat, but after reading some of the reviews I felt it was worth a try. It was out of this world! 

I did add a bit more salt, pepper and garlic than the recipe called for and also a tablespoon or so of crushed rosemary. I followed the cooking times and took the meat out when the thermometer said it was ready. It was just outstanding! My husband and I both agreed that it was as good, if not better, than any restaurant prime rib we have had.

Thanks for sharing such a great way to make such a wonderful special occasion roast.

I have made this three times now and all my guests raved about how amazing it was!  This method has always produced a moist roast.  So easy- picked up a boned and tied rib roast, coated it in olive oil and Montreal steak, and patiently waited. Cooked 40 minutes on the second heating for medium with only a slice or two of rarer cuts in the middle. Since the oven is tied up, I serve with the slow cooker mashed potatoes from this site.

I was unsure if this recipe translates to a larger roast. I did a 10 pound roast and it was wonderful!  I did bake it 90 minutes for the first bake, otherwise it was the same. Everyone raved about it.

OH. MY. GOODNESS.  This is an amazing recipe/method!  Did this yesterday for my first prime rib Christmas dinner.  Had two 6.5 lb bone-in rib roasts.  Put in for an hour at 375.  They both reached 130 after only 2 hours sitting in the oven after turning it off (you MUST have a meat thermometer to follow this cooking method!).  If you have a well-insulated/new oven, it will not need to sit that long while it's off.  Turned on at 375 for about 40 minutes = PERFECTION!  Meat was about 145 when we sliced it.  I did create a paste from fresh rosemary, garlic, salt, pepper, and EVOO and smeared it all over the roasts before putting in the oven.  It gave the fatty side a nice crispness - next time will make more of a paste to get more crispiness since that is so yummy.  Also added 2 c. beef broth with 1 packet onion soup mix to the pan during the 2nd roasting time which created a great Au Jus, but we didn't need it since the meat was so juicy and tender.  Thank you for the great recipe and reviews - will definitely make again this way!

UPDATED REVIEW: Christmas 2014. YES THE SIZE OF THE ROAST DOES MATTER! This year had a 10.5 lb roast - boned and tied (4 bones) - and followed this again only to have it take MUCH longer than it did with my two 6.5 lb roasts last time. First hour roast was fine - went in at 46 and after an hour was up to 60. 3 hours of resting it was only at 111 degrees, but had to eat soon so put oven on for second roast and took 1.5 hours to get to 140 degrees :(

We tried this recipe on Christmas with a 12 1/2 lb. roast. It was by far the best prime rib we have ever made, and came out perfectly medium rare when cooked to an internal temperature of 145. The outside of the roast was well done, and the center a warm and very moist and tender pink. The first inch or so of the roast at either end was medium-well to well done, so for those of you intending cook a small roast (1-2 ribs in size) I would be careful to use a meat thermometer if you are aiming for medium or medium rare. We used an electronic oven thermometer, and consequently were unable to shut the oven completely off as the oven would beep at us to set the temperature. Consequently I set the oven to the lowest temperature allowed, which on our oven was 170 degrees. I don't think the oven actually ever went on at that temperature. Otherwise we followed the recipe as written. We will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe made our Christmas dinner a huge hit!!  The most amazing TENDER and JUICY prime rib I have ever made. I had a 9.5 pound roast and followed this recipe exactly. Two big things to follow- leave roast out at room temp prior to cooking. I left mine out 2 hours. When you turn the oven back on- use a meat thermometer to get the roast to the right temp and not the time. I had mine at 150 which is a little more medium rare. Once you let the roast sit 20 minutes after cooking it will come out perfect.  A little pink but no blood and so tender and juicy. You will LOVE this meal!!!

I let the raw roast (5 lbs) set out a couple of hours before putting it into the oven for an hour and 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Halfway through I added about 3/4 c. of water in the pan (no rack). After I shut the oven off and left it there for 2hrs&15min.  Then I just turned the oven back to 375 without removing the roast to preheat first-- and let it cook for about an hour because I definitely did not want rare or even med rare. I prefer not to have my meat moo at me...so I was concerned that the meat be only a slight pink...but since the original recipe was getting reviews of being 'rare to med rare' I had to guess how much time to add and I didn't have a thermometer.  The outside crust was getting so dark that I did not want to 'dry' out the inside. Well with this method (slow cook for 2-3 hrs with self contained heat)it keeps it pretty moist. So I ended up being very happy with the result I got by just cooking it a little longer as stated above. Then just like it says, let it set for 10min. Add some of those coagulated dark drippings to a little beef broth heated up and there is your terrific jus.

A good thermometer is a must with this recipe to ensure doneness, but GREAT recipe!  It was amazingly tender and flavorful.

I have never been able to cook a really good prime rib roast. I was looking for something to go by and found this recipe online.  THIS is the recipe I was looking for!  The beef was superb...cooked to medium rare perfection, tender and full of flavour.  Follow the recipe exactly and DO NOT open the oven door.  That is the secret!  I am thrilled! My favourite dinner just got better!  Thank you!

Soooo good! Like some others,I rubbed rough-ground rosemary & used coarse saltfrom a grinder  liberally.The butcher twine-wrapped the bone under the roast ,very nice because bone-in is difficult to cut.I showed hubby the roast while the oven was sup to be shut,but just turned the oven on for 15 mins at 300,no problem..got Curious AGAIN about internal temp & removed roast to give it a stick..130 degrees,coming along nicely..since my fam likes unrare meat(sigh) I knew I had to check it because I put the 5.1 pounder with bone in at 2 pm.,& with a 3hr wait plus 45 min plus 10 mins resting the roast we wouldn't be eating till 7,so plan your time better than I did..Anyway it fed us 4 glutton portions(about 3/4 inch thick,give a little extra for hubby & son slices ;) with a couple of nice size slices left over..along with the baked russet potatoes I added during the last hour & steamed baby carrots it was a very delicious Easter Eve dinner indeed for our little gathering of four..Thanks for posting!

Foolproof!  My husband loves steaks but hates roast beef - but there was a super sale on rib roasts so I went for it, and tried this cooking method - FABULOUS!  I used a generous amount of Montreal steak spice and followed the cooking instructions.  I didn't peak but was a little worried - it was absolutely wonderful and tasty.  The exterior had a nice crust, and the inside was rare and juicy - like he likes his steaks!  I can now make roast beef after 30 years of marriage!!

I, like a lot of other reviewers, was hesitant with the cooking instructions(especially with such an expensive cut of meat that my brother in law purchased for our christmas dinner, that I was afraid I was gonna ruin), but let me tell you it was the best prime rib that I ever tasted.  I will always make my prime ribs this way from now on.  My husband and brother in law also didn't think the cooking instructions would work, but both of them loved, loved, loved it!!!  The only thing I changed was the second cooking time, I cooked it for an hour because my prime rib was 10 lbs. and it came out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I agree that this is the absolute best way to cook a rib roast!  If anyone is skeptical, please know that this recipe is actually from Paula Dean on the Food Network Site.  It is a tried & true recipe!

This was so easy!  I also was hesitant about how it would come out leaving it in the oven for 3 hours. And yes do  not open the oven door.  The roast came out perfect.  I have never ever tasted a better roast.  I made a horseradish sauce to go with it and it was wonderful.  I have recommended this to several friends already.

Wow. It's definitely a fool-proof recipe. I made this last night for our cmas dinner and it turned out perfect. The only change I made was the rub... I like my outside crusty with salt and spices. I used Hawaiian seasalt, lemon-pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and ground pepper. Definitely easy to do!!

I must admit that I did doubt this recipe, and it worked beautifully. I prepared a 7 pound roast, let it sit on the counter for about 2 hours before seasoning.  I rubbed the entire roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning. When I put it in the oven the temperature was 47 degrees. I baked it on a rack at 375 for 1 hour. When I turned the oven off the temperature was already 123 degrees. After letting the roast sit for 3 hours the temperature was 134 degrees. I was concerned about cooking it further because my family prefers rare/med rare. I only warmed at 375 for 30 minutes and then let it rest. The result was tender and delicious. The inside was medium rare and the outside was a little more well done, so there was something for everyone. Next time I would reduce the initial cooking time to 45 minutes to keep the temperature down so that the end result is rare to medium rare. (To reach a temp of about 125 degrees) i purchased a thermometer with a remote read so I could monitor the temperature at Bed Bath and Beyond which I was key. Give it a try-you won't be disappointed!

I too was a little afraid to try this method. I mean with a 10lb prime rib that cost $70 who wouldn't be?
But I'm here to tell you it came out perfect! My family
was raving all night about it. The only change I made
was to stick in lots of garlic cloves, I love garlic! It was better than any I've had in a restaurant.

Review for a 3.2lb boneless NY roast
I modified the cooking times since mine was smaller, I was a bit worried not because of the cooking technique but because my roast was smaller and I like it bloody. I did the following and ended up with a medium well roast:
375 for 45min, turn off and sit in the oven for 2 1/2 hrs, then bake again for 30min at 375.
It turned out great! Tender and juicy I almost didnt mind it being medium well but next time i might raise the temp and shorten the cooking time.

I was looking for an easy way to cook my prime rib for Christmas dinner. This was the best and soooo easy.  The trick is DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN!  My roast was cooked to perfection and my family loved it.  Will be cooking my roast this way every year!!!

This was my first time to make a prime rib, and all the comments were accurate. It is hard not to open the oven and peek, but patience paid off,and the meat was perfectly cooked.  It was extremely easy and low stress to cook.  My Christmas guests were all really impressed and one friend said the only place she'd had better prime rib was the Culinary Institute of America!  This is our new Christmas tradition.

Great way to cook it. Comes out just how I like it. I rub it with olive oil then rub seasonings on it helps hold it to the melt while enhancing the flavor. Simple, K.I.S.S principle.

This recipe made the most delicious rib roast ever. Only difference was that I put my roast too close to the top in our convection oven, so the outside cooked quickly. I shortened the oven time to two hours, turned the oven off for an hour,  and reheated the roast for maybe 25minutes on 350. Perfect pink all through, with a fine crust outside. Delicous!

Holy smokes, it really is that easy and works that well. When you've paid $45 for a slab of meat, you want it to work out perfectly. And it did. The guys didn't even TOUCH the other meat dishes at our Christmas party once they  had a bite of this. Perfecto!

I did this recipe 3 days ago, the meat was indeed very expensive $67, the taste was very but very good but a little bit bland, just because this recipe here  uses "tea spoon" of ingredients when the original recipe from Paula Deen uses a "cup" of ingredients. Anyway it came out very good.  Next time I will use the recipe from Paula Deen.

A recipe similar to this was passed on to me from my father and has always worked. Using the rub or seasonings of your choice and buttering the cut ends, we preheat to 450 and cook a room temperature roast for 30 minutes, which helps to sear in the juices like pan frying and alleviates the bacteria concern, then let sit in CLOSED oven for 2 hours. The rest is the same, cooking til desired doneness of meat.

This is a great recipe.  We have been making it for years and called it poor mans prime rib.  Using prime rib is by far the best, but we make it with eye round, and sirloin tip and it is really really good also. Less expensive so we can do it more often. It has always turned out fantastic.

When I read the cooking instructions, I thought hmmmm strange.  Decided to take a chance and I followed the instructions.  Now I'm thinking mmmmm, mmmmm magnificent!  This was a melt in your mouth  fabulous roast.  Everyone said it was like something a Chef would have prepared in a fine restaurant.

UBELIEVABLE!!!!!  This is going to be the only recipie I EVER use to make my rib roast.  I did reduce the time the oven was off to 2 hours 15 minutes and then cooked it for an additional 30 minutes with the oven on and the roast was PERFECT.  Next time I am going to reduce the 2nd cooking time to 20 minutes so that the meat is a little more rare.  I used a 4lb rib roast.  Hubby was in heaven eating this meat, he couldnt even speak!!!  Considering when I make this again having my parents over so I can again prove to my father I CAN COOK!!!  I wish I could have given this more than 5 starts!!

12/27/11  I have now made a prime rib twice with this method and I again was not dissappointed.  I used a 7.5lb roast for Christmas dinner but kept the times exact per the recipie and the roast was perfect!  Everyone loved it!  Hubby is already planning on when we are going to make this again.

Amazing. I won't repeat everything other reviewers said but if you do follow the recipe exactly (plus add a little fresh rosemary to the spice rub) you will be blown away. My guests said it was the best beef they've ever tasted and then proceeded to fight over every last bite of the entire 5 lb roast. My new special occasion go-to. Thank you SO much for sharing!

I had my doubts (and fears about it being in an oven that was not on for 3 hours), but it came out WONDERFULLY!  We made this for Christmas 2010 (ok, my roomie Nitta did most of the work) and it was *so* perfectly cooked...red but not raw, all the way through.  We cooked a larger roast (6.5 lbs, I think; the butcher said it should serve 12-15 people) and it was more red that the picture (there are 16 pictures, I know they rotate), which we were very pleased with.  I might try this with an eye round roast...

I used a delmonico boneless roast.  Grocery store was out of a rib roast.  I followed directions and even cooked additional 30 minutes.  Meat was still not done and taste was great on the ends, but lacked real flavor inside.  I will try again with rib roast to review again.

This is truly outstanding - it is a little rare for those who prefer more well done - probably another 1/2 hour when reheating would do the trick.  Made this for gluten-free friends who loved it!

The name says it all. Foolproof! We now use this recipe at least once a month. Our 2 year old twins, who are picky about meat, gobble it up.

My first time making/cooking rib roast, especially for Christmas. Im the vegie/chick eater. So when I told my family I was making roast, they were surprised. Proud to say that the roast came out perfect for my meat eating family. My older brother who usually just feeds me (crackers/water..inside joke) even he was pretty impressed! My husband whos a big time cow eater was so proud! Thank you!

Okay-this really does work...I did this with a 2 lb top sirloin ROAST cooked for 30 min left in for 2 hours. Opened the door to cook potatoes (only 20 min...don't over cook-mine turned out juicy but a little overcooked (had in there for 35 min...) GREAT RECIPE!

I used this recipe for my first attempt cooking a Rib Roast.  IT WAS AMAZING!! I added 4 cloves of garlic inside the roast before cooking. The garlic flavor made it that much more amazing.

This was awesome.  I never comment on recipes because it is usually just personal preference but this was cooked to perfection and everyone said it was awesome...Made with lobster tails, twice baked potatoes, and veggies for New Years Eve.

I used a 3 bone 6.5 lb roast. I added 1 can of beef broth to the pan drippings when I took it out of the oven to rest.  The meat was very rare, so I turned the stove top on, heated the broth & drippings and sauted each piece for about 10 seconds per side before placing on each plate.  YUM! Perfect!  Next time I will use a boneless piece as the bone makes slicing difficult.  We are using the leftovers for Philly-cheese steak sandwiches tomorrow night!

WOW. Roasted an 8 pound rib roast. Used dried rosemary for seasoning. The cookin time was the same as for the 5 pound roast. I covered with foil for 40 minutes while popovers baked. The meat kept cooking and was medium well. Next time I would not do this. The meat was so soft and delicious. Never had a better roast. Meat was purchased at BJ'S so it was not Prime. GREAT RECIPE!

I made this for New Years Eve dinner for my best friends.  It was the first time I've ever made a rib roast!  This turned out perfectly!  I am lucky enough to have a double oven so the other items I made that required the oven weren't an issue.  But you would need to plan accordingly if you only have one oven!

Great recipe, the only flaw was that I didn't realize cooking to 145 degrees would cook it medium.  If you want medium-rare, only go to 135-140.  145 pushed parts of it dry.  Otherwise, easy, tasty, and will make again.

My sister and I are both meat lovers. I shared this recipe with her and we have both used it a half dozen times, comparing notes each time we each make it. The roast comes out perfect every time! One reviewer wanted to take away a few points because your oven is out of commission; I would not take any points away. This recipe is perfect and while I'd love to have roasted potatoes or veggies, garlic mashed potatoes will do! I signed up for this site specifically to rate this recipe as the all-time best way to cook a rib roast. I learned one lesson though. I tried to use the oven timer to cook the roast and discovered that I hadn't accounted for the ramp up time of the oven - the result was that it was slightly underdone for my guest. So next time I use the timer, I'm going to add 20 minutes to the original cook time.

Used a 6 lb roast.  Seasoned w/ salt/garlic and cooked per directions.  The last hour I took out and added carrots and potatoes + a little turkey broth (all I had).  It came out very well...not quite pink enough though.  I had a hard time slicing the meat because of the bones.  It really was delicious and the dog got to have a few bones.  This really is a great cooking method; but so time consuming that I can only do it on a day off from work.

Wow! This recipe is great if you are in charge of the "meat", but aren't hosting at your house -- where the oven you cook it in is (my in-laws are vegetarian, but host Xmas). After the 2-3hrs of not opening the oven, I took it out, covered it with foil & brought it to the in-laws. I finished it in their oven and it received RAVE reviews from the carnivores - One said "This is the best meal I've had in this house in 30 yrs!" --- Thank you for this recipe & instructions - AWESOME!!!

This was my first attempt at rib roast.  Since it is such an expensive cut of beef, I was nervous that I would overcook it; but this method was perfect and the roast was absolutely awesome.  A perfect medium rare.  I had been researching recipes for weeks prior and this method was the easiest and had the most positive reviews of any I saw.

All I can say is wow!  My hubby went off to work on Christmas Eve and I surprised him with this when he came home for dinner.  He had talked for years about how his grandmother had always made prime rib for Christmas Eve.  He told me that this was just like his memorioes.  Thanks for the special new memory.

I did an 8lb roast this time for Christmas dinner.  Again, PERFECT!  Put a little olive oil in the rub and it stuck better to roast.  Only had to add a little time at very end due to size...used meat thermometer.  AMAZING!!!

This was Awesome! My first time cooking a Prime Rib Roast (5 lbs). The only changes I made was in the rub. I used Lime-pepper seasoning, garlic salt, salt (1/4 tsp only), and Rogan Josh (yummy spice from India) It was a Fan-tabulous flavor..A keeper for sure!!

I, too, was nervous about this roasting technique, having never made a roast before.  I made a 7+ pound roast for 6 adults and 2 kids for Christmas and had leftovers.  We rubbed the whole thing down with sea salt, pepper, garlic powder and rosemary.  I'd heard simple seasonings were best.  We also inserted garlic clove spikes throughout the meat.  We followed the cooking instructions to a tee and it was PERFECTLY medium rare at the end of the 2nd roasting time (45 min).  The foodie that ate it raved all night!  I am no longer afraid to make a roast and will definitely make it this way from now on!

Made this for Christmas dinner. Never made prime rib in my life- husband LOVED it! I rubbed the roast with olive oil and spices about an hour before letting it sit at room temperature. Roasted uncovered, added beef broth for au jus- absolutely amazing (and this is coming from a woman who normally doesn't like red meat). Will become a Christmas tradition.

This was my 2nd try at Prime Rib.  1st time was a disaster as it was not totally thawed.   I was very, very nervous about giving it another go. Trust me when I say, put your fears aside and use this recipe!  It was the best meal I have ever made.  Followed recipe with the exception of adding a cup of beef stock during the 2nd cooking.  A tradition has been born.  Thank you!

I had planned on making a pot roast in the crock pot, but my friends told me that I got way too good a cut of roast to do that with.  I checked on here and this recipe works great!  I rubbed the roast with olive oil and a salt/pepper/rosemary/time/sage mixture.  Turned out perfectly medium rare ans smelt wonderful! I used a suggestion to put beef stock in the bottom of the roasting pan and used a little red wine instead of beer.  Thickened the drippings and added them to the veggies and gravy cooking in the crock pot.  The only thing I had forgotten was some bread or rolls to sop up the gravy.

I was a little skeptical about this cooking technique but it worked very well. As with any cooking method, rely on your meat thermometer toward the end to know when to pull the roast from the oven.  The spices are nice and simple and don't overpower the meat.  All in all, A+!

This recipe reminded me exactly of the way my mother made it when I was a kid. Since I was using a huge roast (about 8-lb), I added about another 30 minutes to the roasting time. The roast cooked to a perfect medium-rare and everybody loved it. I would definitely make this again next Christmas. Thank you very much.

We just fininished eating a Rib-Eye Roast that I cooked with the aid of this recipe. I had a 4 1/2 lb, bone-in roast. After letting it sit at room temp for 1 1/2 hrs, I spiked with garlic & applied the dry rub: recipe + Rosemary (1/2 tsp). Baked UNCOVERED in a 375 F oven for 1 hr. After 3 hrs in a "sleeping" oven, I returned the temp to 375 F for 40 mins. I got an internal temp of 140 F & after resting for 15 mins, the roast was rare to medium rare. It was so tender, juicy & awesome! My husband usually puts A1 on everything but I asked him to try it with just the Aus Jus...he was awed! For those that think this is Paula Dean's unique recipe: Just because she is a well know personality doesn't mean she "created" this technique or spice rub (I've been using salt, pepper, garlic powder rubs for years!). Thank you for the tips on cooking a Failproof, Perfect Rib Roast!!

Have been on this site for years and have never written a review until now.  This was incredible, best way to cook a rib roast hands down.  Have cooked rib roasts for 15+ years and have never had one just melt in your mouth as tasty as this.  Thank you.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I have cooked prime rib a couple of times before and both times it turned out good but not great. It was my turn to cook Christmas dinner and everyone requested my prime rib. I needed to make it even better than before. Everyone RAVED about it. It was absolutely perfect. The only change I made which is completely minimal was to add a teaspoon of onion powder as well.  I threatened everyone with physical harm to ensure no one opened the oven lol.  It was perfect and a wonderful Christmas present for my 79 year old Father who is Dutch and buys sliced roast beef at the Dutch Store that is extremely rare. He loved it.  Thank you so much!

The best ever!!  No matter if it is bone in or not, it cooks the same. Just cook it a little longer at the end to make it med rare , med or well done. The recipe makes it pretty rare and can be adjusted to your personal tastes.  I would give this one ten stars if I could!!

If only I could afford to make this more often! Never knew it was so easy. Cooked a 3 pound roast and the second time was about 50 minutes to get it to a perfect medium doneness.

Too dry, not enough flavor for us. But I liked the concept of leaving it in the oven to cook.

I got a prime rib roast on sale not too long ago and used this recipe to prepare it since I'd never made one before. It was soooooo good and made our house smell amazing! I was leery of the cooking method, but it was perfect!

I was so nervous, not only because I'd never cooked a rib roast before (and they are so expensive), but also because this was the main course for our Christmas meal.  It turned out more than perfect, and I will never again make anything else for Christmas (and maybe not Thanksgiving, for that matter).  I had expected it to be too salty, or not flavorful enough, but it was exactly right, and everyone raved.

I was hesitant on just leaving the roast in the oven for so long without the oven turned on.  The BEST roast I have ever had.  Well worth not being able to use the oven for a few hours.

This is an amazing recipe-the meat comes out melt in your mouth- better than any I have ever had at a restaurant. My only propblem with this is it is difficult to buy the meat at my local grocery when it's not around a holiday

I too had my doubts about turning the oven off after one hour but I did it and it turned out wonderful.  Just enough spice on the roast.  This is definitely a keeper and will make again.  
I have used this recipe a few times now and it always turns out.  Thanks Salsiepie for a sharing your recipe.

Excellent recipe - worked great for my 5.5lb Rib Roast!  After the 3 hours with the oven off I opened the oven and put in potatoes for baking (I pre-cooked them slightly in the microwave first).  This did not affect my roast in the least as after 3 hours there is almost no heat left in the oven.

I was a little leery of the "turn the oven off" part, especially with an $80 hunk of meat.  It turned out perfectly.  Even though the seasoning seems spartan, it really did the trick.

I made this last night for dinner and did as some other reviewers and used Montreal Steak seasoning and took it out of the oven at 135 degrees and it continued to cook to 141 and it came out perfectly medium rare this is for sure a keeper of a recipe.

Fantastic!  I do a Rib Roast every Christmas and decided to try something new this year.  I had a 12 pound Rib Roast and it turned out perfectly using this method.  I used my usual rub of Olive Oil and generous amounts of cracked black pepper, herbs and sea salt and was not disappointed.  I use some of the drippings combined with canned beef broth to make the au jus. This is a dependable recipe.  A Meat Thermometer is a must.  (Make sure you know how to use one properly.) Thanks Salsiepie!

I give this cooking method 10 stars !!!!  I used a rub of olive oil, minced garlic, onion and garlic powder etc., rubbed it before starting this cooking method, with not much hopes it would come out right because I was always taught HIGH heat initially and low heat for the duration.  BUT to my surprise, IT WAS PERFECT !!!  I did actually tape the oven like most readers stated, and I did have the urge to peak but didn't.  The second cooking time I left it in for 37 min, took it out to rest for 15 minutes covered with foil, and OH MY GOD !!!  I'm critical and could not find one thing wrong with the cooking method.   Even my husband who eats his meats well well well dead-done, had a huge piece and loved it.   Mine was a 5 lb roast and not even the best of a prime rib quality meat and it beat most all that I've ever ordered in a restaurant.  THANK YOU for this recipe.  It is FOOLPROOF.

This was really good.  Although, it does suck that your oven is taken up for so long, but it's not much different from roasting a turkey.  I just made quick cooking sides and prepped them all the night before.  I make prime rib every year and it's always a hit but this years rib roast was by far the best.  Thanks!

Used pork so had to leave in oven a little longer during reheat.   Recipe worked perfectly.  Best, most tender roast I've ever had!  Everyone loved it.

Unbelievable!  This was the best Christmas roast ever!  The only change I made was mixing the salt, pepper, and garlic powder with about 2 Tblsp. olive oil before rubbing it on the roast.  I also used recipes for Herbed New Potatoes and Orange Glazed Carrots which did not require oven time, since the oven is out of commission for the entire 5 hours before dinner.  Well worth it, though!  Absolutely amazing roast!

I made as written, except for some reason I drew a blank with temp'ing (for some reason I had it in my head to remove the roast at 140, that plus resting time...) - I cooked for 15 min too long, resulting in a medium roast (I wanted med rare). The only thing I would do differently is omit the salt. REALLY - this was a nice, no hassle way to cook a rib roast. Tasty! If you have a 5 lb roast, follow the directions. It will turn out. Thank you Salsiepie.

I have never even attempted to cook such an expensive cut of meat before and to serve for guests no less. This recipe gave me the confidence to do just that, and it DELIVERED!!!  Moist, Tender, and Flavorful.  Lots of compliments and had a few requests for the recipe too.  Thanks Salsiepie!

This is a perfect way to do a rib roast.  However, you have to plan your other dishes if you only have one oven.  I rubbed the roast with olive oil and then the seasonings.  Next time, I'll do the second segment of cooking for one hour.  It was a bit too rare for me but otherwise, just delicious!  I did add beef stock to the bottom of the pan before baking but it pretty much just evaporated.

This was my first time making a rib roast, and this recipe did not dissapoint. The only thing different that I did was to use McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of salt and pepper. It was easy and resulted in a delicious and tender piece of meat. Leftovers would be great in a Philly cheesesteak or French Dip.

This was excellent.  Possibly a little bit too much on the rare side - i had a 10 pound roast - but the flavor was excellent.  i put some slices under the broiler for about 3 mins for those who liked it slightly more well done.  overall, an excellent recipe.

Easy and great! I have cooked many of rib roasts and this turned out as good as any. The ONLY reason I gave this four stars and not five..... make sure to get the best cut of meat at your local butcher block. I bought the less expensive this time and could tell the flavor diffrence. You may have to ask for the better cut at the butcher block, but for the extra money it is well worth it. It not a cut of meat you serve daily, so when you make one be sure to get the best cut possible!   I covered my roast with rub and the heavly covered it with light corn syrup then rock salt. I was a little worried about to much salt.... not to worry! The prime rib was great and when served cut it with butter knifes!   I cooked a 6.5 lb roast. I never put a thermometer in it untill the after the last 30 - 40 minutes of cooking, it was rare, left it in another 15 minutes....perfect. Also mix some hot horseradish with a little sour cream, to dip in, of course with some au jus, great addition to a wonderful, easy, recipe! ENJOY

Last night my husband and I cooked our first rib roast. We had a 6 pound boneless ribeye roast. Also, all we had was a roasting pan without a rack. I thought for sure we were about to ruin this $50  piece of meat. We followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. The outside had this great crust on it and the inside was medium rare, very moist. This is our new Christmas dinner tradition. Thanks to Paula Dean for her expertise. She really does know what she is doing (yes, this recipe is on her website word for word).

Delicious! I crusted the fatty side using the recipe for 'Garlic Prime Rib'. The only change I made was roasing at 500 for 30 minutes, then 375 for 30 minutes the followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out PERFECTLY. Yes, it comes out medium rare (maybe on the rare side) but in my opinion it's jucier that way. This is on my list for Chrismas Eve dinner every year now! Served with 'rice so nice' and au jus (drippings + 1/2 cup red wine + 1/2 cup beef stock).

I haven't made a rib roast this way, but have made many, and based on all of the reviews and my experience, it sounds like a good method. The reason for my comment is to dispute another's claim that the bones continue to cook the meat and therefore you cannot use a boneless roast. This is completely ridiculous! The residual heat in the oven is what slowly causes the meat to cook. I suggest using a thermometer with a probe (one that has a wire that connects to a digital display) so you can check the temp without opening the door.

EXCELLENT,so easy. We made a very simple recipe for au jus. 1 26oz carton of Swanson beef stock, 1 1/2 tablespoons of beef bouillon granules, let simmer. Also use it to heat up the left over roast the next night. GREAT RECIPE

When I made this recipe, I was a little weary on how it was going to taste. But to my surprize my family love it. very easy and taste. The only thing I would change would be to add some onions to carmelize on the roast while it is cooking. Excellent Recipe.

Fantastic!  I followed excatly and it was hard not to peek, but it was so worth it!  Perfectly tender and delicious.  It was a bit peppery for me, but I am not a fan of pepper, so next time I'd add less.  The meat was cooked perfectly though!

This recipe was excellent. The seasoning tasted good and the roast was juicy not dry.

thank you so much for this excellent recipe.  Mine came out almost perfect, unfortunately I read the reviews before making it.  One person said it came out dry, so I panicked (because I cannot stand overcooked food), and I took it out after 5 minutes during the reheat stage.  It was extremely rare so I sliced it and put the sliced meat on the barbecue.  It still came out great, but next time I will trust this recipe :)

Made this for Easter. My husband loved it so much he asked me to make it again for Father's Day.  Everyone raved about it.  Thank You for a wonderful recipe!!! I will no longer order prime rib at a restaurant since I can make it myself for a fraction of the price. All I need is a good recipe for au jus...I used a package and it was good but would love to make it myself.  Don't hesitate to try this.

It turned out wonderful and I followed the recipe perfectly. Don't add seasoning until just before putting it in the heated oven.

This was the easiest roast I've ever done... I was skeptical as others at first but judging by the other reviews I went with it.  I used the recipe for Garlic Prime Rib on here and man alive was it fantastic!

Now I have done this twice with different size roasts. Both turned out very nicely. I did put temp up to 400 for first hour on the second one since I saw that in another recipe. I wonderhow it will work for a very large roast. I will try that next.

Excellent, I was in a hurry so I cooked it 1/2 hour longer then followed the recipe.  Turned out Medium.  I prefer rare, will let it sit in the oven less time next time.

Wow, wow, wow!!  We just recently split a cow with other family members, and I had no idea how to prepare a rib roast.  Of course I came to my favorite recipe site first for ideas.  I was also very skeptical about this recipe, but decided to give it a try after so many positive reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and I agree, it tastes just as good as in the best restaurants.  The whole family agreed that this is a keeper.

Everything everyone said about this recipe was true!  It was absolutely perfect.  I used a 3 pound roast and I didn't change anything.  The only thing I couldn't figure out was why there were no drippings for gravy.  You have to try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!

I love rib roast but have always been afraid to make it.  Since they are not cheap I wasn't sure if I really wanted to take a chance at screwing it up.  However, I got brave this year and bought a 7 lb. roast for x-mas and gave it a try.  It was extremely easy and turned out perfect!!!!  So....if you are like me and a little scared give this recipe a try.  Easy and like it says "foolproof"!!!!  Deeeelish!!!!

I'd never done a prime rib before and tried this recipe.  My family loved it and the aroma throughout the house while it's cooking is fabulous!  I followed the instruction exactly and it was so easy and sooooo good!  You can't go wrong with this basic recipe.

Just awesome.  I had to visit other family members on Christmas.  The boys I left in charge doubted my recipe was correct and after several phone calls and text, they followed the directions.  Everyone was pleased with the results.  So yummy.  Needless to say, my directions will not be questioned again!!  Thanks for the recipe

This was the first time I had ever cooked a Prime Rib.  I followed the recipe for the cooking time and it came out PERFECT.  I did takes some hints from Bobby FLay for a thyme au jus.  Set roast aside tented with foil to keep warm.  Heat roast pan on high over two burners, then add 2 cups red wine until reduced; scraping bottom of the pan.  Whisk in 4 cups beef stock, cook until reduced by half.  Whisk in 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, salt and pepper to taste.  My guests loved it!

This was a perfect recipe!  We made this for Christmas Eve dinner, following the directions exactly.  I had to leave the house to keep from opening the oven door though!  Thank you!

Update Thanksgiving 2015  -  I added beef broth with liquid smoke and Kitchen Bouquet to the bottom of the pan, then delayed with another cup of beef broth at the end. Also need to pull it out at least by 130 degrees. 135 was almost too dry.

We used this recipe for the Christmas Rib Roast.  WOW....tying up the oven for hours has never been sooooo worth it!  PERFECT roasting plan! We rubbed it with olive oil & Pampered Chef cracked pepper and garlic rub.  Phenomenal!  THANK YOU!!!  PS---we took the advice of another and taped the oven door shut, lol.

The Recipe worked perfect! I resisted the temptation to open the oven door when it was off for 3 hours and then turned it back on and finished off to 155 degrees and it came out medium and very tender and juicy! I also added Rosemary to the rub and was quite tasty! I can still smell the Roast the next morning! I highly recommend this recipe! Although it does tie up your oven a long time if you have other things to bake! I was fortunate that my inlaws live with us in an attached apartment and we used there oven for other things!

Oh and I am a 50 something male cook who is new to all this cooking in the last 5 years! Prior my only specialty was breakfast cook and anything on the grill! It's been fun trying out these recipe's on this website! I love the user comments and enhancements!

I've never cooked a rib roast before and like other reviews I was nervous about the cooking instructions. Who wants a $70 hunk of leather to gnaw on… But I trusted the recipe and the rib roast turned out absolutely delicious.  Our roast had 3 bones and was 7 lbs, our butcher recommended a cut near the loin instead of the chuck, he said it is a more tender and tasty cut. I would have to agree. The roast temperature was 135 and came out a true medium rare. I did add extra garlic and a mix of Italian style seasonings... we are garlic lovers...Fantastic recipe! I'll definitely use this recipe in the future. Our family decided it will be our new Christmas dinner tradition. Thanks!

I followed the directions exactly like noted.  I used a 3 pound rib roast.  I did add 2 cans of beef broth, a head of garlic (skin on, sliced in half) and 1 onion (halfed) to my roasting pan.  Made delicious au jus.  Thanks for a great meal.  My husband said it was the best!

Oooh yeah, Babe!  This was the best prime rib I've ever had--and this was the first time I ever made it.  Pat, my son-in-law (Pat's mushroom saute), said the same thing.  I used the spices as a rub, using a little rosemary, wrapped it in plastic wrap overnight, and fixed it today for dinner.  I moistened it a bit with evoo and used the beef broth when I turned the oven back on so I would have some jus for dipping.  It was sooo good.  We'll have sandwiches for supper.

Very good!! Followed recipe, but turned oven back on after 2 1/2 hours (30 minutes early). Still -- turned out great. Loved by everyone in family -- will certainly make prime rib this way again!

This was wonderful!  I used Lawry's Seasoned Salt, black pepper, garlic powder, fresh rosemary and fresh thyme as the rub.  With a tablespoon of horseradish on the side, this was a great pre-Thanksgiving dish!

I cant believe how easy and how good this roast was. I dont eat beef but everyone couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was.My husband was nervous about the process but when we cut into it and it was perfectly cooked, itwas worth not opening the oven door. The only addition was some steak seasoning to the rub otherwise cooked as directed.

Oh my gosh!  After 30 years of marriage this was the best rib roast I've ever made!  Hubby loved it!  Mine was a 4 lb. and I reduced the "off" oven time to 2 1/2 hrs.  It was rare (which is how we like it).  I'll cook it this way from now on!  Oh! Forgot to add...I used Costco Steak Rub!

My guests raved.  This roast was perfect and it was my first time.  Don't be afraid to open the oven after the 3 hour "rest period" to add your veggies etc. to the oven.  So long as you have a meat thermometer on hand to ensure when the roast is done you will be fine.

This was a foolproof rib roast for sure. Like everyone else, I was hesitant on the cooking method, but in the end I can easily say this was the best rib roast I have ever made.

This recipe was absolutely incredible.  My husband of course was very doubtful and tried to figure out how the rib roast could possibly bake in an off oven.  WELL!!!  it was the best Rib Roast I have ever made.

This was the best raost I have ever made, I too was a little skeptical, but it was cooked perfectly and you could cut the meat with your fork, it was that tender. Outstanding and thanks for the recipe.

Recipe is great. You have to be patient but it comes out really nicely done. 
I added more spicing than it called for and it came out great.
Will definitely use this recipe again.

I was a fool to think this was foolproof. Small roasts cannot be left in this long. Mine was sadly overcooked but of course I couldn't check it because of being over warned about not opening the oven. Mine needed 45-60 min less during the sitting time or less rewarming. Very disappointed.

I needed a consistent recipe for perfect timing. Amazing. I always use the same rub on my rib roasts though, and I have not found one better yet... I cut slits into the fatty side of the roast while it’s sitting out. Then I mix olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, crushed rosemary, sea salt and lots of freshly ground pepper in a bowl and pat it onto the roast. Gets dark and crispy and delicious while cooking!

My 'choice-not-prime' 3 rib 6 lb roast was just right. It was medium rare after letting it rest. My medium-well guests were impressed and well fed. Same recipe same time next year!

Never having cooked a prime rib roast before, I decided to follow the recipe exactly as printed, especially for the first time...can always make additions next time.  It was spectacular!  Roast weighed 5 1/2 lbs......came out perfectly medium rare....just beautiful and absolutely delicious!!!!  Will certainly do this again....

My roast came out great. only issue was I had an 8 lb roast. I add to the cooking time, but the center of the roast was too rare. I'll have to add more cooking time next time. my hubby likes well done and I like med rare.

As others have noted, I was nervous to prepare an expensive piece of meat according to this recipe.  I was serving 6 for NYE and purchased a 6 1/2 lb standing rib roast.  I followed the directions for a 5 lb roast but added an extra 15 minutes in the first

My son-in-law and I both made this recipe. What did we do wrong? We followed the instructions and the meat was dry and overcooked. I cooked mine for one hour, turned off the oven and within a half hour the temp was at 145 degrees. I took mine out after an hour (instead of three). I see a few others have had the same experience. Why???

Excellent recipe!
I started my 8 lb. roast by severing it from the ribs at the butcher's block. They called it "cradled", and then they tie it back on with bakers string. I will continue to do this now that I know how much it helps when carving.
Aged it 10 days, then let stand to get close to room temp.
Then after a crusty S&P rub, I cooked it first on the grill to get the carbonara steaky flavor, on six sides for 4 minutes each, before inserting into the pre-heated 375 oven for the prescribed hour, and then turned off the heat.
My oven is propane, and I was concerned about the additional heat loss over electric ovens due to the venting below. But I think the searing in the grill saved me.
After only about 1 hour I turned the heat back on (per another helpful review), and 30 minutes later, pulled out a handsome roast!!
Flavor was incredible, per the grill searing, and aging.
Thanks for this PERFECT prime rib roast recipe!

My oven has a ventilating fan so have to keep temp set at 215 deg F after the first hour, otherwise stove gets too cold.   Excellent, came out perfect every time.  So easy.

I bought the same size rib roast, 5 pounds, as the recipe used. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a roast that was medium to well done. We love it rare so this pretty much ruined our Christmas dinner.  It was WAY too much time in the oven.

I made this for Christmas Dinner this year and OH was it a hit... I seasoned my Prime Rib (bone-in) with just salt and pepper, and then chose to use the "slow" roast method. The roast was only 5 pounds, (only had 3 individuals for dinner) so I decided to use the slow roasting method. It was FABULOUS ... This is now my go to way of cooking a prime rib .... FYI...In the past I did a boneless prime rib and it was good too but this time I did bone-in and found that WOW it does make a HUGE difference in flavor, from now on I will ALWAYS make BONE-IN Prime Rib.

Standing rib is a Christmas tradition for us.  I have been cooking them for over 25 years.  Due the number of people I used an 8.5lbs roast and increased the cooking time accordingly and only brought the core temp to 135.  This was THE BEST PRIME RIB any of us have ever had and we are regulars at many fine restaurants such as Ruth's Chris, Donovan's and Morton's.  Absolutely perfect and tender.

I am by no means a chef.  I'm actually a horrible cook however, this year we hosted our first holiday and made this receipt simply because the title said "Foolproof" and the recipe seemed to give me 4 hours of free time on Christmas morning.  This came out perfect beyond belief!  So delicious.  I took the recommendation from someone else's review and added rosemary to the rub (a generous tablespoon).  We are now making this roast every year!!!!

Raves from the family.  I doubted the whole process and bought frozen pizzas as a backup.  How can something so simple turn out so good? I had lots of time to spend with the family as side dishes were made and ready to pop in the toaster oven and microwave.  If only prime rib wasn't so expensive.  (sigh)  I'd make it more often

I usually use a high temp initial bake followed by a low temp “rest” technique. I also usually buy a large 7 bone roast as well. 
This recipe worked well for a 5 lb. roast. I was most presently surprised. The hard part is keeping the “looky loos” out of the kitchen and away from the oven

Much, much too salty.  had to wash it off to make it even slightly palatable.  Might be the only Chef John fail that we ever had.  Meet taste was wonderful, but the salt ruined the entire  meal.  Where did we fail?

This was my first prime rib and it turned out perfect!  This is a very good and simple recipe.  I used my meat thermometer that I use with the smoker and grill and by following directions, the temperature came out exactly where I wanted it.

Made this for Christmas Eve Dinner and it was excellent. Ran short on time so I shortened the time by 30 minutes where it was just hanging out in the oven and it was fine. Better than fine. Yum!!

Last Christmas I made this and it turned out perfect so I am making it again today the same exact way. I think I read all 1500+ reviews before trying it. I am so happy with this recipe, I'll never make prime rib any other way.

I prefer my standing rib roast a little on the rare side, not bloody. ALWAYS use a meat thermometer. It's very easy to over cook the roast. Remember, to let it "rest" when you remove it from oven.

I was introduced to this recipe in 1987, and have been using it many times every year.   I've passed it along to many, and all are amazed how easy it is.  It doesn't matter what size the rib, it's the same amount of time.  Very important to not open the oven at anytime during the process.

I would like to make this Rib Roast Christmas eve, as it looks amazing and everyone had great reviews.  However, I have an oven that has a fan go on as soon as you turn it off.  The fan helps the oven to cool.  It is not a convection oven.  Will this recipe work for me?

I have to admit rob roast is very pricey but since Christmas eve is approaching so I thought what the hell lol... first I did take the advice from a comment about adding rosemary and rubbing olive oil top of the rib roast...And to keep my family from opening the oven door  I had my dog Mr. Brown to guard the oven so nobody can be curious to peek lol..It's a true story and my rib roast was tender and juicy and absolutely delicious.

I have made this for no less than 15 years it goes over great at Christmas! And it never fails. The doneness can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the cooking time the second bake time Zone. also I triple the garlic & double the salt & pepper and rub it in good when I bring it out of the fridge to rest. This I feel boost the flavor. 

Also another quick secrete DO NOT OPEN the oven DOOR no matter how great it smells. This ensures it stays juicy I think.

I've made this for the last 5 Christmas dinners as it quickly became a new tradition after the first time. my son and husband tasted it!   It's wonderful to put in the oven and not have to baste or do anything else for a few hours during all the Christmas activities.

This recipe works so well. I’ve made it 3 times. Follow the directions. Taking the meat out prior is huge. I’d add and extra 20 minutes to the pre-cooking sitting on the counter time. Don’t open that oven. All 4 of the guys in my family LOVED it.

I have made this numerous times over the past 5+ years and it comes out perfect every single time!  You have to follow the timing and under NO circumstances do you open the oven door. BUT.........this is a Paula Dean recipe from years back and SALSIEPIE is taking credit for it. Unless Paula Dean got if from her. In that case I apologize.

I have my own rib roast recipe and it’s fool proof. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Coat roast with black pepper and add other seasoning if desired. Place in shallow pan. Bake for 6 minutes per pound then turn oven off for 2 hours. Do not open the oven door! I like a rarer roast so I bake for just 5 minutes...can’t go wrong!

I also like this method. Roast is juicy and tender. A variation that also works well, (even with cheaper cuts like eye of round, sirloin or rump roast) Preheat the oven to 475°, prepare roast with you favorite rub, put it on a rack so it's not laying on the pan and place in oven for 7minutes per Lb. (so if you have a 3 Lb. roast = 21 minutes roasting) Turn off the oven and DO NOT open for two hours. Beautiful medium rare. If you like it a little more done, adjust initial roasting time to leave in oven longer 8 -10 minutes per lb.

It was tough and not very flavorful. I think it needs to be a prime cut. Mine wasn't.

Delicious! We had a 2.5 lb roast and I followed some suggestions from another review. We cooked it for 30 minutes, let it sit in oven for two hours with the oven off. Then we turned on the oven for twenty more minutes. We pulled it out and the temperature was only 115 so we put it in for another twenty minutes. It got 145 and was soooo delicious! We are definitely trying this recipe again.

This was perfect and so easy to make with just a few minor time adjustments, to eliminate the pink but overall this works! 
Looks good, taste great, my masterpiece! :)
Kudos!

This is a variation on Chef John's math-based calculations, which I prefer.  Not bad, though.

Have tried it 5 times and my family loves it.   It is like going to a  restaurant.   Actually the heat is on a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes but read the directions carefully and do not open the door while cooking or the meat resting.     Easy to make
and absolutely delicious

This turned our great! I had a 4.5 lb roast and followed the recipe plus an additional teaspoon of garlic powder and some homegrown dried oregano. It was delicious! Next time, maybe leave in a little less time on the reheat for a slightly rarer result. Served with roasted asparagus and button mushrooms braised in butter, garlic and wine!

I've been doing this with rib roast for 40 yrs. It can be done hotter for 1 hr and left with the door shut if you go to work, do this in the morning and then reheat for 30-40 min.  before you serve.  Cuts from med well to rare.

Cooked as recipe recommended. This was the very best rib roast I have ever made by far. The recipe just made sense to me. I was cooking at a very high temperature for a shorter period and was not pleased at all. This method turned out perfect!!!. Thank you!!!

The recipe worked well. I had to make the roast early so I stopped the cooking at the internal 120 degree point and placed it in a dutch oven and refridgerated it... until later when I preheated the oven to 375 degrees and finished roasting to 145 degrees internal temp. It was delicious.  

PS - I deviated slightly from the recipe, I put the roast on a bed of carrots, celery and onions with 2 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of red wine (Merlot). Yum!

I’ve made it three times, same directions...once was great, the other two times I had difficulty getting it cooked to 145 without overcooking it. Not sure what to say except I wouldn’t necessarily call it foolproof. A lot depends on your oven and how well it holds heat.

It was definitely flavorful. I had a 6.5 lb roast and cooked it exactly as asked. It was more medium to med well.  I will definitely check the temp more often as I cook it.

I'm not sure what Lolo Kay is talking about when she ended up with a black and overcooked roast.  We've used this recipe at least 4 times and it comes out perfect every time.  Perhaps she's at a unique elevation and her oven is cooking different.

My only suggestion on this recipe, is to put a 1/2 cup of beef stock at the bottom of the roasting pan, so that the meat drippings have some juice to combine with.  

Perfect recipe, trust it!

Perfect medium rare (by my standards) but I did go overboard with the seasonings but drenched with juice it was all good. I will be making it again.

I had a 4 lb.roast.  It was at room temperature when I started, and although it was very good , it was well done.  I think I am going to try  30 minutes at 375 and 2 hours with the oven off next time, for this size roast.

This was delicious ...but I didn't put it in the middle of the oven so the top was a little too cooked. Even though the temp was 135, it was done with a little pink.

One person was right cooking this way seems odd but it does work as long as you DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR. I kept it covered the entire time in the oven then took off the tin foil when I went to turn the oven back on. My wife likes it medium so I waited until the internal temp was 130 then took it out. PERFECT and I was very concerned I would mess up an expensive piece of meat.

My first time making a rib roast. I was nervous, as it is not a cheap piece of meat, and was afraid of overcooking it, but this recipe made the job easy! I relied on a meat thermometer, and let the process work itself. My husband told me it reminded him of the roasts he would have as a child and it brought back great Christmas memories. Will definitely make this again for a special occasion!

This did not work for me.  I’m think8ng it was due to the fact I have a double oven, so the heat most likely escaped when it sat for 3 hours with the oven door closed.  Came out really rare in the middle even though I left it in for 60 minutes for the final baking time.  

I don’t recommend it if your stove is a double oven like mine is.

This way of roasting a standing rib roast, (prime rib,)turned out so tender and yummy. I am making it now, my second time. I recommend this recipe.

I added garlic cloves into the roast. The roast had a nice crust, and was medium coast to coast. Best one I ever made.

I am a man and not real experienced cook.  I was a little skeptical about this recipe however, tried it today.
It was the best rib roast I have ever had.  I followed the instructions to a tee although it was very tempting to open the oven door.  Cooked perfectly on the outside and pink on the inside.  I am passing it on.

This recipe is AMAZING ! This is my first time making a Rib Roast so I was quite nervous. But I trusted all the good comments. I had a 5.2 Lbs roast. I followed the recipe except that I only let it rest for 2 hours instead of 3 hours. I also added 1 tsp of rosemary.
 The roast came out perfectly. However, I used Kosher salt so it was a bit salty, next time I will use normal salt.
Thanks for sharing. I am now a converter! I used to cook steak a lot,  but now this Fool Proof Rib will be my only project !

I had a 6 lb. roast and cooked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes. It took over an hour to come to the proper internal temperature when reheating it. I will use the recipe on a five pound roast. I will also ask the butcher to cut the meat from the bone the next time.

My 5.5 lb roast took 70 minutes to reach 135 degrees when I turned the oven back on, rather than the 30-40 minutes stated in the recipe.  Good thing my husband was patient and I did not have a house full of hungry people waiting.

Great recipe.  Unfortunately I managed to overcook mine. In spite of that it was still great. It was well done but still juicy, tender and flavorful.  I  didn't have a rack so I put large chunks of raw onion in the bottom of the pan and placed the roast on the onions to roast. Added another dimension to the flavor.  I  will make this again and shorten the cooking time a little. I'm also going to invest in a good meat thermometer lol.

I followed the recipe or method, which it us, and it came out perfect.  Last year I started to roast my rib eye at 450f  and had my alarms go off , never again.  This came out perfect.. I was skeptical at first but it came out perfect. My family was amazed. Thank you.

This was the first time I made a standing rib roast. Mine was 3.3 lbs with 2 bones. I read other reviews and allowed the roast to sit out for at least an hour to come to room temp. I cooked at 375 for 40 mins, turned off the oven and let it rest for about 2.5 hours. After about an hour I got paranoid and turned on oven light-the roast appeared overdone so I opened the oven to check it but one touch told me it was fine. I waited the 2.5 hours and turned oven back on and opened again to put potato casserole in. I cooked for another 30 mins, took it out of the oven and let it rest 20 mins. It was absolutely perfect-medium rare to medium-so juicy. I would suggest cutting cocking time for smaller roasts- also opening oven 2x did not seems to affect the outcome at all!

I followed the cooking directions and thank goodness I looked elsewhere for the temperature.  I used a meat thermometer and took it out of the oven at 130 degrees, it was too well done for my family.  I wish I had taken it out at 125.  It keeps cooking while it sits.  There was enough pink for everyone, but way too much well done meat.  I also put a rub of fresh minced garlic, kosher salt & pepper.  Delicious.

I've been making this for years since I first saw it on Food Network under Paul Deen's recipes. It's been great every time. Except one year when I didn't account for an extra heavy roast. This year, I'll extend the cook time a little.  It's simple, easy and fuss-free.

I was so afraid of ruining my first rib roast but I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out PERFECT!  I have made 4 times now and will again today on Christmas. I like that I don’t have to tend to my oven all day and can spend more time with my family on Christmas.  I make the other sides while the roast resting And it all turns out wonderful.  I don’t even like to order prime rib at a restaurant anymore because it’s never as good as this one I make at home. Thanks for this recipe it has become our Christmas tradition.

Awesome Cooking method!

Follow the cooking temp and instructions but I only do 30 min on second cook time. my wife likes well done beef so I just soak it in the au jus to get it to temp for her afterward. 

here are my other notes for seasoning. 

baste meat with olive oil. seasoning for crust. add extra tsp salt and pepper as well as a tsp of rosemary and thyme.

I have used this method for the past ten years.  Perfect every time!  Before this recipe it was hit or miss every year.  Only change I make is I use garlic cloves and insert into the meat.  It is perfect!

I’ve made this twice with roasts under 10 lbs. and they have turned out awesome. This year I have a 16lb roast and nervous about cooking time. Any recommendations as to cooking time for such a big piece of meat?

Great recipe! I don’t usually cook beef but had company for Christmas and wanted something special for them. I followed other comments and added a bit of fresh rosemary and kept it uncovered the whole time. Also, since it was a 9 lb roast, I increased the 2nd cooking time to 50 minutes. It turned out perfectly and had rave reviews!

Followed the recipe to the letter for a 5# rib roast. I also used a meat thermometer.  Wanted medium-rare got medium-well. Very disappointed in the degree of doneness.  It should have been great but ended up an expensive fail.

This was so easy to make and came out delicious. Perfect. I made a 3.5lb roast. Based on other comments, I only made the first cook 45 minutes. Left sitting in the oven for 3 hours and the second cook I watched carefully until the roast showed 145 on the meat thermometer. Checked it after 30 minutes and then again at 45 minutes, when it was done.

Just follow the recipe as written, season to taste and this comes out perfect.  Do not open the oven in the process and you’ll be fine.

I followed the recipe exactly and it has worked every single time.  I've used varying sized roasts from 3 to almost 7 lbs and with a very slight adjustment to the time for the extreme size, it has never failed.  I will say my oven tends to run hot, so that may help, but I have never had one turn out dry or anything beyond medium rare.

I followed the instructions to the letter without ever opening the oven door. After cooking for one hour and leaving in the oven for 3 hours, the roast was still completely rare according to my trustworthy meat thermometer! I will never use this recipe again if I want my dinner to be on time for my company.

I was intimidated at the thought of making such an expensive cut of meat. No more! This was so easy, and it turned out tender, juicy, and just so wonderful! I did rub on a few extra spices, and added a little stock to the pan for au jus. Don't hesitate to use this method!

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Let roast get to room temp. Salt and pepper all sides of roast.  Put on rack in roasting pan.  Roast in oven for 45 minutes. Turn oven off. Do not open oven door for two hours or more. Perfect pink and juicy inside. Wonderful!!!!

Only way to cook a rib roast. Easy and reliable. Don't even think about opening the oven door during the process. Have shared this recipe with others and they rely on it now.

This was my first rib roast and it won't be my last!  I only made a few minor changes after reading several of the reviews. 
I added a teaspoon of ground rosemary to my seasoning mixture.  I also sliced some onion, mushrooms and garlic and used it as a base to sit the roast on while it cooked. I also poured a cup of beef broth in the pan because I read that the roast doesn't produce a lot of liquid.
I cooked the roast as directed and it made the house smell soooo good!  Believe it or not the roast tasted even better than it smelled.  I sliced it really thin and also very thick, and both ways the beef was delicious.
Try this method.... you won't regret it!

This is WONDERFUL!  The only thing I did differently was spray the entire roast with Olive Oil and added fresh sprigs of Oregano from my garden to the top of the roast.  This came out so moist and flavorful!  I love recipes that allow for the flavor of the meat to shine through.  This is a definite make again.  Thank you for sharing!!

This has been my go to recipe when cooking a roast for years now, and it never fails.  I normally rub olive oil and add more seasoning, but otherwise cook it like it's written. Love this recipe!

This got a 3 rating from me because it’s not foolproof. I followed instructions, but after cooking it for the time in the recipe it was 100-120 internal temp (I don’t remember exactly now. I continued to cook it for 10-15 minutes at a time checking temp, and I overcooked it. It was well done. My dad spent a lot on the meat and we had company.  I was so embarrassed. I will try it again and add another review.

recipe should specify a gas or electric oven. And stress the accuracy of the temp setting. Mine is electric. timing was followed to the minute, and the roast was barely done, the family said 'looks raw to me'.  So, I'll try again later this year, add at least a 1/2 hr to time in the oven, and start out and finish at 400 degrees. Last, add a good meat thermometer to the list of ingredients, and add 2.a, insert meat thermometer. Silly I know, but some of us don't have the cooking gene, or the cooking spouse/partner.

Not good. We followed the directions but at near the end my spouse could smell burning. I looked at the roast and it was super dry and burnt on the outside. These instructions lead to a very well done roast. I normally use a thermometer and aim to get the beef to a temperature of 145 F. But the meat had already reached 145 F during the first hour in the oven. Should have taken it out .... :-(

I’ve made it for three holidays so far. I would make it again for Easter. I’m just not happy with not being able to use the oven for all that time. I wonder if I could take the roast out after the time and then put back in the oven to reheat before serving. Leaving me a free oven to bake some other dish ( lasagna/ manicotti/ has any one done that?

THIS RECIPE IS A REAL WINNER!
I will never cook prime rib any other way. It was so easy and came out perfectly cooked, tender and moist. I made a "rub" using rosemary, minced garlic, thyme, salt, pepper and olive oil. I rubbed it all over the roast and put in the fridge overnight.  I love that it is so easy! And YUMMY!

Bad!!! The 145 degree internal temp is WAY TOO HIGH, unless you like dry, well done prime rib. Use a meat thermometer if possible.  The internal temperature  should be 130 degrees for medium rare, 125 degrees for rare, or 135 degrees for medium. Remove from oven, tent loosely with foil, and allow to stand for at least 20 minutes before carving. Temp will go up about 5 degrees while standing. Then carve after the 20 minute standing time.

So I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I followed the directions exactly. When I turned the oven back on for the end, I couldn't keep it in till done because the bottom of the pan drippings were burning. How can I fix this?

If this is supposed to be fool proof then I guess it says a lot about me. I had a 4 1/2 lbs roast and followed this recipe to a T. It was the first time I'd ever bought a rib roast because we could never afford it. I wish I'd tried some other recipe because  it was inedible. The outside was completely dried out and the inside was extremely rare. 

Ticked off in Tulsa

Great way to make Prime. My husband is picky about his prime. We have been doing this recipe for about 4 years. It has turned out perfectly every time. We've done a 2 1/2 and a 3 lb. We don't change the time. We use a roaster pan with the lid off. I tried to add onions, garlic, and carrots to the bottom of the roaster pan this year and they ended up being burnt, so don't do that. It's very important to not open the oven door. Thank you for this recipe!

I made it for Christmas dinner. It was first time I made standing rib roast. I seasoned liberally with McCormick's Montreal Steak rub. My roast was 7 lbs. with bone-in.  I followed directions exactly, roasting till my new meat thermometer registered 140°. It took longer than 40 minutes reheating. It turned out delicious. Juicy and tender. Next time, I will only leave in 375° second time until temperature reaches 135°. I like medium rare. This roast ended up medium well. My guests were very happy and loved the flavor.   I did ta pe my oven door shut for the three hours resting time. I didn't trust my husband to not peek.

Size does matter.  I had a 12-pound rib roast.  I let it sit out for 4 hours because it was so big and knew it needed at least that long to come closer to room temp.  I then followed the recipe to a T - up to a point.  I used a temperature probe in the meat to know for sure when it was "done" (130 degrees for medium rare for us).  When it had cooked for an hour it was registering at 77 degrees.  I trusted the various reviews and decided to just leave it in the oven.  After an hour in the closed oven, the temp had risen  to 98 degrees.  I had hopes. Within the second hour, temp raised only to 102 degrees.  Because I could see the writing on the wall, and had my in-laws arriving in less than an hour, I put the heat back on.  To raise temp to 125 degrees took an additional hour and a half at 375 degrees.  Then I had to let it rest for an additional 30 minutes.   Although the final product was perfect (the ends were medium and the center a beautiful medium-rare), we were late getting dinner on table by a full hour.  For guests, that was not cool, even though it ended up being delicious. 

My point here:  Perhaps for a smaller roast this would have been perfect, but for a LARGE roast, this did not work in the time required.  Use a temperature probe thermometer.  Cook it until it is at least  within 30 degrees of desired doneness and then let it sit and raise to desired temp.  Depending on the size of the roast, that can be 1-3 hours cooking time plus time in the oven to come to te

This was amazing, and raved about by all! It was SO HARD not to open the oven or peek, but I stuck to the recipe. I will make this again! The one problem of me was that because you have to leave it in for over 4 hours, I couldn't bake anything else during that time. I roasted Brussel sprouts and sweet potato cubes BEFORE I made the roast, and kept it warm in a crock pot. That dish went beautifully with the roast!

The one change I made to this recipe was to leave the oven at around 175 because my oven cools down too fast. Other than that, this recipe is awesome.

My kids used to take turns going to the inlaws every other Christmas, not any more!

Its a winner for sure!

I was so nervous about making this roast.  I made it before over 8 years ago and it was a total fail.  PLEASE TRUST THIS RECIPE.  I had two roasts:  a 10 pound and a 5 pound that I cooked at the same time.  I followed this recipe exactly (plus added the aluminum foil at the end to rest), and both roasts turned out perfect.  Towards the end I could see that my thermometer wasn't reading correctly, so I pulled it out after the amount of time listed in the directions.  The meat was so tender and delicious - everyone raved about it.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was my first Rib Roast; and like some other reviews I was really skeptical of the receipe. I followed the directions to a T EXCEPT I cooked mine for 90 minutes initially because we like ours done NO Pink; I then left it in the UNOPENED Oven for 3 hours; then I removed it and cooked my Mac n cheese and cornbread dressing. I put the Rib Roast back n the oven for 1hour to finish the cooking priocess; and I will tell you there was NOT any Roast left. This was the best receipe and I will be making again. My Roast was 4.60lbs and I did rub it down with olive oil before seasoning with McComick steak season pepper and I also rubbed on some minced garlic. . I did leave the roast out on the counter for 2 hours before I cooked it.

Made this with a 2.5lb rib roast. I followed the recipe until step 3 where i made adjustments in the cooking time. I roasted for 30 min in the preheated oven then turned off the oven and let it sit for 2 hours and turned it back on to 375 for 20 min. I took it out at 15 min though because it started to smell like it was burning and I got nervous. Came out PERFECT! Now that I have a solid recipe I will definitely buy a larger rib roast next year so I can impress everyone. Thank you for this!

I followed the process perfectly and it was fabulous!  

I had a really large Rib Roast - 16 lbs.  My only issue was that the outside got a bit burnt on the tail and on some of the fat cap.  I would likely move the starting temp down to 475 next time and just monitor the internal temp with the digital thermometer more closely.  It was awesome... lots of happy family tonight.

I used a 3.9 lb boneless KC Strip Sirloin Roast.  I followed the recipe as written, and the roast was delicious.  I plan to share this recipe since it was easy, had minimal  ingredients, and was as tasty as any I have had in restaurants.

145 degrees?!! My wife would toss it in the trash or feed it to the dogs. Also, gas ovens cool down much faster than electric ovens (because they're vented), so this method might bomb in a gas oven. Maybe turn the gas oven down to 200? Anyway, I never let a beef rib roast get above 130-135 (135-140 after resting), or it's too done for our pallet.

I made no changes and this was the most perfect roast I have ever made.  I used a 3lb eye of round roast.  Juicy and so very flavorful.  You do have to adjust time for weight.  I cooked mine for 3 hours total

I roasted a 3.80 lb roast per the recipe.  After 2.5 hours of oven off, my probe read 160*.   Instead of reheating, I took it out and carved it after 10 minutes of stand time.  Was cooked medium well, but very tasty and juicy.   I will adjust roast time down to 45 minutes next time to get a more rare small roast, but it was easy and successful.

This is the first (and not the last!) Prime Rib Roast I have made. I bought a 10 pounder. I coated it with olive oil and then liberally rubbed with Montreal Steak seasoning. I cooked on 375 for 1 hour 15 min then turned oven off. With only 20 minutes left of the 3 hour period of oven off I restarted oven to 375. Since my roast was so big it took an hour to reach 128 degrees. I took it out and tented with aluminum foil for 20 minutes. Temp was 135 when I sliced it. The middle was a nice soft pink. I would not want the temp to get any higher for ours. I used a digital thermometer with the probe that attached to the thermometer that sits on counter. I would not attempt it without this. The meat was incredible! None of my ketchup eaters picked up the ketchup bottle!

I've done roasts in the past and this is definitely the easiest recipe. We like ours on the rare side so I did need to keep an eye on the temp, and did pull it out 90 minutes into the 3 hr window in the oven. I put it back in for 30 minutes before serving to re-heat. Came out perfect! As with cooking any roast, a good meat thermometer is key!

I also season my roasts the night before - makes a difference!

Perfect!  Followed directions exactly, except for timing.  My roast was small (3#) so I inserted thermometer and monitored while in oven.  Took about 45 min to get to 145 degrees.  That's when I turned oven off and left alone as directed.  Reheat took about 25 min, then left standing for 10 min.  So easy and so delicious!

Third time trying this and works great, my last rib roast was a bigger 2 ribber so I cooked it at 400 at the start and was perfect rare at the end, I think you have to pay attention to the size of your roast, the method is sound.

This recipe is fantastic! I used a 3.5 lb roast and added some rosemary in addition to the suggested ingredients for extra flavor. It took me 3.5 hours from the time I took the roast out of the fridge until I started carving it up. Here are my temperatures and timelines for medium doneness.
0 min, 36 F (took roast out of fridge, put on counter)
60 min, 58 F (put seasoned roast in 375 F oven)
1 hr 45 min, 130 F (turned oven off, so oven was on for 45 min.)
2 hr 40 min, 141 F (turned oven back onto 375 F)
3 hr 15 min, 160 F (took roast out of oven)
3 hr 30 min carved up roast.
As mentioned above, the roast was done to a medium and was very juicy. This was my first time using this recipe and I will certainly be using it again and again. I also won't hesitate to use it on larger cuts either.

Made exactly as stated and it was perfect.  As others commented, it did not leave enough drippings to make a proper gravy.  Next time I will follow the advise to add some beef broth under the roasting rack.

The only reason I tried this was because  9 years ago the submitter defended this"recipe" as being around before Paula.So I tried it with a 3 lb. roast but had it hooked up to digital probe.Bang on results @ 130 degrees.oven off 1 hr.The roast was bone in and didn't use a rack.

Never made a rib roast before    It was wonderful.  Only question is how do you get juice for gravy.  My roast didn't have any and I added beef broth

I have made this roast 3 different times once at 6 pounds, 5 pounds and 10 pounds. It turned out perfect. The only exception was with the 10 pounds the last cooking was for one hour only absolutely perfect there is no other way. Med rare in the middle and the ends were well done. Delicious and moist. 
Highly recommend this recipe

Writing this because I'm making this again today. Did it just as stated last Christmas. Came out fabulous. My oven is , so I have to use a thermometer just to make sure the oven is whatever temperature I need, so it adds to the cook time, but if you're  going for a 5 hour recipe, whats 10 min more?
 Used the well-done end end pieces for stew. Recommend slicing it all and portioning  any leftovers up. Just cooking for 2, so a 5lb roast makes about 3 steak meals, plus the stew I mentioned. Don't recommend freezing the steaks for more than a week, definitely trashes the quality (tastes like roast beef). Thankful I ran across this, Kudos!

Like so many others, I was skeptical about this recipe, but, gave it a go...and am so glad I did. This is definitely the easiest recipe ever and the best Prime Rib Roast I have made! Thank you for posting!  I didn't give this recipe 5 stars because it doesn't mention anywhere whether to cover the Roast or not..I knew, but, some newnies might not.

This is as the recipe states, a "fool-proof'" way to roast a prime rib.  My roast turned out fantastic! DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR or you'll jeopardize the end result of the roast. AND, a meat thermometer with a probe that is inserted into the roast and the thermometer remains outside of the oven is a MUST HAVE for this recipe. Next time, I will remove the roast at 135* and tent it as instructed to get the doneness I want around 140* internal temp. When the roast is tented, it will continue to cook and the temp will rise a few degrees.  Thank you for sharing the recipe and the process with the cooking community!! Fantastic!

Definitely cook less time if you have smaller roast. My roast was 3.5lbs left in off oven for 2.5 hours after the initial hour, then turned back on for 30 minutes. Came out a medium well. I'd prefer more medium rare... was a bit dried out due to the time.

Followed directions to the T!  This doesn't work for a smaller boneless roast.  Cooked a 4 lb rib roast for 60 minutes at 375.  Used double oven thermostat to measure oven temp and internal meat temp (I'm a big griller so I have a nice one). At end of 60 minutes, the center of the roast was at 109.  Once it reached 135, I had to take it out of the oven because it was over cooking. It went to 145 before it finally stopped. Medium to medium well roast. Ruined a very expensive cut of meat.

I have made this several times and it comes out perfect.  Cook as instructed and make sure you calculate 7 minutes per pound.  That is key.  Season with your favorite herbs and spices.  Awesomely yummy.

PLEASE NOTE:  Cooking to 145 will be overcooking your meat IF you're aiming for a beautiful reddish-pink medium rare as shown!  An oven thermometer is crucial to cooking a prime rib with any method as ovens, roast sizes and beginning roast temp will vary.  You're cooking by temperature, NOT time. Cook to no more than 125 for medium rare, pull it from the oven and tent with foil.  The roast will continue to raise another 5-10 degrees, depending on how long you keep it covered.  130 degrees is optimal for a medium rare prime rib (in the center - the edges will always be a little more cooked since they're closest to the heat).   If ever you slice into your roast and find it's under-cooked for yours or a guest's liking, you can always heat it a little more.... there's no fixing it if it's over cooked.  As for the rest of the recipe.... This is the first time I've used this method of roasting (I've cooked a prime rib many, many times - usually grill or oven high heat first then dropping temp to 325 for a short amount of time).  I got a slightly more even cook with this method with regards to the outer edges.  My 8lb roast reached 125 degrees within 2.5 hours from first putting it in the oven so I didn't get the chance to turn the heat back on at the end.  I didn't really use the suggested seasonings as anything will do since the seasonings will really only be on the top fat cap and the ends.  I used course garlic salt, thyme and pepper.  My roast turned out pretty good (dark pink

Slight modification to account for weight of roast.  5 min a pound @ 475 F, shut oven off, let  stand in oven without opening door  for  two hours.  Take out and slice.  Perfectly done med-rare every time

145 degrees is way too high for a really good rib roast . Take it out at 125 degrees for a nice mix of 25% medium well,  30% medium rare and balance just skoche 25% slightly more rare.

The rib roast was under cooked and where I like rare it was too rare and cold  for some of my guests.  Threw it back into the oven but the rest of the meal was timed to the roast so a good thing i had wine.

It was delicious beyond describing! First time I ever made prime rib. Mine was only2.36 pounds so I gave it a garlic rub and salted it,then popped it in the oven at 500 degrees for the math time of 12 minutes. Then I turned the oven off and left it in there for the 2 hours.(longest 2 hours I think I've ever waited for anything) When I finally took it out and cut it,the knife just slid through it like butter! The taste was --WOW! Thankyou Chef John!!!

So simple, yet delicious!!!  I was wanting to cook a prime rib for New Years and found one (last minute). Found this recipe and decided to give it a try, very glad I did. Only change I made was using Bad Bryons Butt Rub to season it. Followed the cooking directions and it was perfect. My roast was almost 8 pounds and when it was done you cut cut it with a fork. Can't be pleased enough!!

I cooked this roast for a new years eve dinner (for the first time). Result: everyone was blown away by the taste and melt-in-your-mouth texture of the roast, I was shocked, but held back my delight. This was a 3.7lb roast and I varied the cooking times to suit the difference in weight and accounting for the age of my oven. 
-1hr 15mins for initial cooking @ 375F - until internal temperature reached 145F (turned off oven)
-Let sit in oven for 2hrs 30mins Internal temperature dropped a little over that time.

-Loaded pan with vegetables and cooked meat for another 30mins @ 375F
-Baked vegetables in fat from roast for an additional 30mins while meat rested out of the oven wrapped in foil.

Roast was medium rare and vegetables were perfect.

This was a simple recipe to follow. I seasoned the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning and I inserted 6 cloves in an 11 lb. roast. The cooking directions were great and it came out perfect for all in attendance.

This method sounded dubious, but the reviews gave me confidence to try it. Followed the directions exactly, but dressed up the dry rub a bit. After doing part of the final roasting after letting it stand, I popped in a meat thermometer and finished it to the suggested temp. This made a delicious, elegant meal.

Our 7-pound roast was perfect.  It took an extra 30 minutes in the beginning to get the internal temperature to 135 degrees.  Otherwise, the recipe worked as promised, and the roast WAS foolproof.  This is the second year we have made it for Christmas dinner.  The smaller roast last year was exactly according to the recipe.

I would give it 5 stars but I added rosemary to mine but everything else I did according to the recipes.  It was the first time I had ever made it and I was a bit scared some of my family would not like it. Well, I was way off!! When served it went from being loud, laughing and just have a good time to complete silence! I kept looking around to make sure it was my loud family. I had absolutely no leftovers  I'll be making this again! Thank you for the recipe.

I made this for Christmas and it came out almost perfect. I took it out at 140, let it sit for 10 minutes and it was a little overdone for my taste - barely pink - but melt-in-your-mouth tender and excellent flavor. I followed the seasonings exact to the recipe. Next time I will take it out a little sooner. I agree with another reviewer that the only negative is that the oven is out of commission for so long. But if you plan your menu accordingly, it is no big deal.

Perfection! I don't understand why people have issues with this recipe. It's super easy. If you open the oven, you're letting the heat out ... I've made this recipe several times, no deviations, and it's always terrific. FOOL PROOF, evidently not for some, but it's perfect for me.

I was so intimidated about making this because we were having 12 people over for Christmas dinner and this was the first time I have ever made it.  Leaving it in the oven and not opening the oven door was a leap of faith.  It turned out absolutely perfect.  
 I highly recommend this. One note personally is we have since ordered an electric knife from Amazon because it would make it so much easier to cut perfect pieces for serving

This is the 1st time I used this method, and it is now my go-to recipe. I started with an 8 lb roast, cut from small end, bone removed and tied back on. Left it out on the counter for 1 hr (next time I will go 2 hrs), the put in 375 oven. It was 43 F when I put it in the oven. At 1 hr it was in the sixties, so I decided to leave it in another 15 min. Finally got it to 73 F when I turned off oven. It continued to climb, up and up. Finally topped out at 132 F with 45 min rest time to go. Turned on oven to 375 F, then watched like a hawk til it got to 135-137 F. Took it out to rest for 15 min, the cut into the most perfect rib roast. A meat thermometer is critical. Use one that hooks to a display outside the oven. I would not try this recipe without one.

12-25-16...Followed directions with a couple of changes.   Made my own seasoning mix.  I took the 7.25lb "Choice" grade roast out of the fridge Christmas eve and left it covered in the garage overnight until I got up Christmas day at 0700 and brought it to the kitchen.  I had cut off  the 4 bone rack so I seasoned both sides of it and tied it back onto the roast and made a paste of olive oil and my seasonings and let it set until 1pm.  Internal was 55 degrees.  Put the roast in at 375 for one hour and turned the oven off.  At that time the internal temp was 71 degrees, using a wired thermometer with a remote unit.  I waited the two hours and watched the internal rise to 121 degrees.  Turned the oven back to 375 and It took about 30 minutes to see the temp start to increase so I turned up the heat to 385 for about 45 -50 minutes until it reached 135 degrees and took it out to rest for about 30 minutes.  Everyone raved about it, not quite med rare, a little past that.  Delicious.  Next time will take it out at 130 degrees, I like that full on med rare!!!

Fantastic recipe for prime rib. The secret is to keep track of the internal temperature of the roast as it cooks.  The size of the roast, the actual temperature of the oven, and the desired doneness of the roast are variables that affect the outcome.

And since you can't open the oven door after turning the oven off, it's important to be able to follow the roast temperature. I use a remote food thermometer to accomplish that.  Personally, we like medium rare so we  used a meat temperature of 135º F.  It came out perfect.

This was amazing recipe! I was a little hesitant to try this recipe but wanted a special dinner for Christmas.  My husband loves prim rib, but we were traveling in our motor home during the holiday and cooking in a very tiny oven is tricky. 
I did make a few changes, I allowed roast to come to room temperature for about 4 hours. Then I made slits in the roast and added  cloves of garlic all over the roast about half inch in. I also used a steak seasoning rubbed over the roast. Then I covered the roast in foil while cooking.
Will use this recipe again!

We made a 5# boneless and it came out awesome.  However it took about 1/2 the time.  I used a good meat thermometer and about 1/2 way through the 3 hour time with oven off it reached 140.  I took out of oven and it sat for about an hour wrapped in Reynolds wrap.  Temp dropped to about 130 when served.  145 is too much in my opinion.

We made this for our Christmas day dinner using a 6 lb roast.  I am so glad that i checked the reviews and followed the advice to put a meat thermometer in the meat before sticking it in the oven.   The cooking time seems to depend on the type of oven you are using. We were using an electic oven and the meat reached 130 degrees after only 1 hour and 15 minutes after turning off the oven, the recipe says leave it in for 3 hours.  If we had followed the cooking times our meat would have been completely overdone.  Please, please, please use a thermometer with this recipe...this meat is too expensive to take a chance.

I made this using a 6.33 # instead of 5#pound rib roast. Adjusting time for weight, the roast came out perfect. I did not use a thermometer, and the meat was a nice medium rare. The crucial part was adjusting the time. Since I had a 6.33# roast and the directions gave cooking time for a 5#  roast. Adjusting the time for the size of the roast yielded a perfectly cooked roast. I tented it and let it rest for 10inutes tented before carving. Will make again.

Have used this recipe twice and followed directions to the letter. Each time it has come out raw in the middle. 120 degrees. I am going to round file this recipe. Back to the oven for another hour.

I made a 4.5LB Rib Roast following the instructions except I added a teaspoon of rosemary. It could not have been better. Beautiful rare to med rare throughout. I will use this method again. I steamed baby potatoes for twenty minutes and roasted them with in the rib roast pan after I took the roast out to rest.

Made it again this year with a 6 LB Rib Roast and once again a perfect rare to med rare roast.

Okay this was honestly one of the best dinners we have had!! My family RAVED about it for the next two days; just delicious! We had a 3 lb rib (perfect for 5 people, no left overs). Used exact amounts of seasonings and time in oven as recipe asked for. Had to tape the oven shut like it suggested... but really turned out awesome! I used a small ceramic dish to prop the rib up because at one point it fell on its side.

Works every time!!! One thing a person needs to make sure your oven is accurate  using  Oven thermometer! That's does make a difference if oven is off temperature.  Do NOT  open door while cooking.  Also  your oven might not be sufficient in holding temperature if old and not enough insulation. That would make a Big difference.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written.  I used a 5.5 pound roast.  The roast was well done after the final 30 minutes at 375.   Since I was shooting for medium rare, it was a fail.  However, it had a nice flavor, which I attribute to the cut of meat rather than the recipe.  I think it probably would have been medium rare at the end of the 3 hours without turning the oven back on to 375.

I followed the directions to the tee! It came out fantastic! 
I used rosemary, salt, pepper, freeze dried garlic, freeze dried red onion, and topped over it with olive oil spray.
I convectioned it on a rack that allowed air to circulate around the roast which made a nice crust and allowed the seasoning to stay on the roast with no melt off.  It was as soft as butter and the taste was heavenly. I didn't want to stop eating it!

I used Montreal Steak Seasoning and Garlic Powder.  Used this time and cooking method for a 11.5 standing rib roast.  It was delicious...perfect... I wondered with getting a larger size.  But this method is truly fool proof. We have used this recipe now for the last 3 Christmas!! Thanks so much!!

I'll tweak it. My roast turned out medium / well done. I like it medium rare / medium. It's hard to mess up a roast. The Easter Eve diners liked it!

Was nervous since I've never made prime rib but made it for Christmas Eve and it came out perfectly!! Couldn't have gotten better in a restaurant.  It's going to be my go to Christmas Eve dinner.

I had a 2.5 lb roast,cooked for 30 mins and cut off because i had to leave.   Came home few hours later and cooked for 30 and took out oven.  It was overcooked, grey inside.  Next time i won't cook it that long.  Tasted good although.  I ground up some rosemary in a coffe grinder and dusted my roast with that,salt and pepper.  I put 2 cups water on bottom of pan to have for au jus.  It was maybe 1/2c of water left after cooking

Served for Christmas Dinner for 11.  It was a complete hit. All the cooks were in shock by the "no cook" method.

Delicious flavor, just a bit undercooked for my 5.6 lb roast.  I forgot to use the thermometer, my fault.  Will follow this regimen again with adjustment for my [perhaps] cooler oven.  Husband LOVED it, he likes his meat a little more rare :)

I used salt and pepper with garlic and coffee grounds in the butter instead or thyme and stuff. Plus I did the 500 degrees for 28 and it rested for the 2 hours. Weight was 4.91.  This method turned out amazing.  Best tasting prime rib I ever had.

I have made this several times with great results. Made some slight changes.  Preheat oven to 450 F. Placed roast in pan for 1 hour at high temp. Turned oven to 325F. Left roast for 2 hours.  Do not open oven.  Perfect rare roast w awesome crust.

The only way to describe this is "excellent"!! I was very, VERY hesitant to follow the cooking instructions, especially on an expensive cut of prime rib but I wanted to try it because of all the rave reviews!  It was amazing!  Based on the previous reviews they key is not to open the oven door.  I was so afraid someone from my family was going to open the oven door during the 3 hours it was turned off ( disturbing the coking process) that I was tempted to put a sign on it.  I thought better of it since that would only spark their curiosity and ensure they would definitely open the door!  My husband was amazed how delicious and tender it was!! He's not a big meat eater but went for seconds and thirds! I will make my roasts like this from now on!  This is an amazing and simple way to cook a roast!

For those who have said it was tough.. I'm just wondering if you actually bought rib of beef or where did you buy it from!? Even if you over cook this cut it shouldn't be tough!! ??

This is the way my mom used to cook prime rib...I had been searching for  her "recipe" and couldn't find it...thank you for posting this. It is the BEST method, the meat comes out perfectly every time. Instead of garlic powder, I cut garlic cloves into pieces (lengthwise) and inserted into the meat at various spots

This method really works for any size prime rib. I bought a 7.22kg  standing rib roast from Costco. That's 7 ribs! It was massive and I was super nervous. After letting the meat sit out for about 2hrs it was at 48 degrees. In addition to rubbing in the seasoning I like to stab the roast here and there and insert cloves of garlic. In the base of the pan I put brussel sprouts, white turnips, carrots and two heads of garlic. Just because I love roasted garlic. I seasoned the veggies and tossed it up in some olive oil.  Seared the roast and put it on top of the bed of veggies. Stuck the meat thermometer into the centre and placed it into the oven. After the three hour off period, the thermometer read 118 degrees. I turned the oven back on to 375 degrees and set the meat thermometer to alarm when it reached 135 degrees.  In less than an hour it beeped I pulled it out of the oven to rest before serving. Everyone LOVED it. The veggies were perfect too. Accompanied with about 10lbs of garlic mashed potatoes and gravy this dinner was SO DELICIOUS. There were no leftovers by the end of the night. None.

I made this for a birthday dinner and it turned out pretty well.  I used a 8.5 lb roast so adjusted the cooking time as suggested by some other reviews.  1.5 hours at preheated 375* then 3 hours off (no peaking - actually put the cleaning lock on!  LOL!) then 375* for 45 minutes.  It  came out more well done than I would have liked but still had some pink in the middle.  I did use a meat thermometer just before the end of the second cook but it was too late.  I think next time I will not adjust the cook time and see how that goes.  I do have a new oven so not yet sure if it cooks hotter or cooler than my old one!  Will definitely try again!

This is the second time I have made this. I keep decreasing the time of cooking, but I'm still ending up with a medium-well done roast. I'm going to keep trying though, because it's so easy! I know one of these times I'll get it right. As for the seasoning, I usually do my own with a little more flavor. I tried the Montreal seasoning this time and applied it so it made a crust. It worked well.

I followed the recipe and my friends and family were absolutely amazed.  I did cut it down to 2 hrs. and it came out rare-medium rare (just the way we like it). It was so tender. The resting time does cook it a little further but it was perfection.  The second roast, I used Montreal seasoning at my husband's urging and we loved that too. This my go-to beef roast recipe forever!!!!!

I've used this recipe 3 times now and used it as my "base". I use my own homemade rub with garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, steak seasoning, cayenne pepper, black pepper and crushed Rosemary. I mix my rub with olive oil, rub it into the roast and I cut small pockets into the roast and stuff them with fresh crushed garlic. Then, I put it in a large ziplock bag and let it marinate in the fridge overnight. On the day of cooking, I cut up onions, potatoes, carrots and baby Bella mushrooms, season them, and add them to the bottom of the roasting pan. I also add 1-1/4 cup of beef broth to the pan under the veggies. I then lay my roasting rack on top of the veggies, lay the meat on it (fat side up) and roast per the directions. It always use a 4-rib roast which averages about 11.5 pounds and it comes out perfect every time. So much rich flavor in an all in one meal.

Hubby absolutely loved it!

I used a 2.92 lb beef bottom round roast.  Coated it well with olive oil, salt, pepper & onion powder.  For some reason, I set the oven for 500-degrees.  After the house's smoke detectors went off after 12 minutes, I lowered the temperature to 325-degrees for 15 minutes...  then brought it back up to 375 for the last 1/2 hour.

Then let it set for a full 3 hours - door shut.

I inserted the meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, and turned the oven back on, to the 375.... Let it heat back up while I made the real mashed potatoes & heated the gravy & carrots on the stovetop.

 I know if I had done it at 375 in the very beginning it would have been perfect.

If you could count the pictures, mine is picture #65    :-)
I will cook all my beef roasts using this technique!

We love this recipe! Comes out great every time. The only thing I do differently is that I leave it resting for an hour before turning the oven back on.  Still comes out great.

I'm so excited about this recipe! It was so simple!! I finally made a roast that was awesome!! I did stab some garlic in the meat. Other than that, followed the recipe. My roast was @ 7 lbs with ribs. Second cooking was about 40 minutes (temp 135-140 ish), then I let it stand 10.  Served it with a horse radish creamy sauce.  Thanks you for sharing this recipe, my husband was surprised it was so good!! Win for me!!

Brilliant! I was a nervous wreck about this recipe, didn't open oven and it came out incredibly well. So much so my guests are still thanking me for it. I used my own rub but the cook method (although nerve wracking) worked like a charm

I used a 4.5 Lb. roast and it came out cooked about right, but was a little tougher than a lower and slower method. The rub itself was as tasty as it was simple. If I make this again, I would likely sear the outside before putting it in the oven.

Made this for Christmas. My daughter wanted Prime Rib in the worst way, and this recipe just begged to be tried. I'm so glad I did. My roast was about a pound and a half bigger than the listed size, so I added 15 minutes to the initial cook time. It turned out to be the BEST prime rib I've ever cooked. Super, super simple and it made me look like a rock star!!! This will forever be my go-to recipe.

Like every other review about this on all recipes, I was very skeptical. We had a 4 lb rib roast. It came out perfectly tender and moist. I initially thought it was over cooked when I carved it, as it wasn't as pink as I usually like it. But it wasn't at all. Everyone loved it. I installed a digital thermometer from the very start. This method ended up with a 145 deg internal temp without any adjusting on my part at all. I can't wait to do this one again.  Chris

This tasted delicious, but it was overcooked following the directions precisely and to the suggested temperature.  I prefer a rarer roast.

This is the first time I've made prime rib.  I was quite concerned that the cooking method would result in it being under cooked, but it turned out PERFECTLY.  I would definitely recommend this method of cooking prime rib to anybody!

I will never fear cooking a prime rib again.  Thanks to all the reviewers who said to do exactly what was prescribed.  This came out so perfect.  Only thing I would do differently is cut the roast against the grain.  Gotta work the au jus gravy a tad next time.  I'm sure I can do better on the gravy.

Was first time I made a rib roast.  Used this recipe on Christmas day.  I used the spices suggested with addition of rosemary.  Applied rub, wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in fridge for 36 hrs.  Otherwise used recipe as suggested.  Internal temp was only 75 degrees after an hr. but I turned oven off.  Was amazing to watch rib temp slowly rise to 145....and no higher.  Was perfect.  I suspect reviewers who ended up with an overcooked roast cooked till internal temp was 145 and THEN turned the oven off.  NO!

This turned out perfectly!  I didn't keep it in for the full amount of time stated in the recipe as I used a meat thermometer and went according to the desired temperature.  I made my own au jus but my family wouldn't "ruin the great tasting prime rib" with putting au jus on it.  I will definitely make this again.

I've cooked roasts this way many times. Always comes out perfect. The only change I make is I insert a thermometer which has a probe and can be read outside the oven. When the roast reaches 8 -10 deg. below what I want I remove and tent it for about 30 min.

Even after reading all the excellent reviews, I was still nervous cooking using this method. After the 3 hours, the oven was no longer even warm, I pretty much panicked. However; I continued to follow the directions to a T and this turned out absolutely PERFECT!!! I will use this recipe EVERY TIME!!! Love Love Loved it!!

Like other reviewers have mentioned, the only downside of this recipe is that your oven is occupied for  3+ hours.  I used a 3 lb roast and reduced initial  cooking time to 45 mins.  After letting it sit in the oven for two hours, I set up a meat thermometer to cook the roast to a temperature of 145 degrees.  I highly recommend having the meat thermometer in for the second cooking iteration to prevent overcooking or to allow for more cooking if you can't stomach medium rare meat.

This was absolutely delicious and super easy!  I really couldn't believe such a simple recipe could produce this perfectly cooked and flavorful meat.  We made it for Christmas and everyone raved about it.  I followed the directions exactly, threatening everyone not to open the oven!  When we turned the oven on again at the end we let the internal temp get to about 135 degrees and it was medium rare and melt in your mouth.

I have used this recipe a few times now and it never disappoints. I was a little nervous the 1st time but it is by far the easiest and most fool proof prime rib recipe I have tried. The hardest part is in fact not opening the door. Also I tend to leave my roast on the counter for at least two to three hours prior to putting it in the oven. Waiting an hour is never enough time to get the roast at or close to  room temperature. Which I find leads to a more evenly cooked roast. I've also learned to work around not having access to the oven for three hours. Believe me the prime rib is the "bell of ball" and the sides are just an after thought.

Fool-Proof Prime Rib Roast - I purchased a 5 LB rib roat. I had the butcher cut it off the bone & then tie the bone back on the meat.  I followed this recipe, but I also basted it w/L&P Steak Sauce after I rubbed the seasonaings on it.  DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN LEAVE IN FOR 3  HRS!  It came out so tender & on the reddish/pink side, which is the way my husband likes it.  I told him I'd put a few slices back in the oven if it was too rare for me.  I prefer my meat cooked medium to well.  He cut me about a 1/4 slice off each of  the ends,,,,,,,,,,, OMG it was so tender , juicy & good, I ate both pieces.  I found it a bit salty (especially being I ate the ends) that I think I would cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon.  Even the dog enjoyed the bones,,,,,  I would definetly make this again.

Prepared this dish according to the recipe. We loved it!  We appreciate the insight into having your oven occupied for most of the day, but we worked around it. We made this Rib Roast for Christmas dinner. So, it was pies in the morning, side dishes on the stove top & bread while the roast rested. A perfect holiday meal!

This was by far THE best prime rib I have ever eaten! I added a teaspoon of rosemary to the seasoning mix and cooked it about 10 minutes longer since my husband likes his meat not so rare. It was perfect!  Melt in your mouth.

OMG!   I made this for Christmas Dinner and it turned out perfect Med Rare to Med for  a 5 lb roast. The hardest part was not opening the oven to take a peek, lol. I taped it shut with a sign Do Not Open, haha. I read the reviews and set the roast out on the counter covered for 5 hrs,  cooked for 1 hour at 375, turned off oven and let it set for 1 1/2 hours then 20 mins at 375 with 10 mins resting time before carving. Served with au jus and horseradish sauce! This is the only method I will use now. Thank you for sharing.

I made this yesterday for our special Christmas dinner and it was absolutely delicious.  It was cooked perfectly and was so tasty and tender.  Everyone cleaned their plates.  And we have leftovers for dinner tonight.  I WILL absolutely make this again.  I highly recommend this easy and very tasty recipe.

Only one catch for me.  When I went to turn the oven back on for the last half hour, I pulled out the roast to look at it because I wanted to put baked potatoes in.  My roasts had these little timers in them that the store puts in and they had popped out.  It also looked very well done on the outside.  I got nervous.  I inserted a meat thermometer and it said it was done rare so I pulled it out of the oven fearing the last hour would overcook it.  After letting it rest for a good long time, I started slicing it.  It looked really rare so I placed it on a baking sheet, spooned some broth from the marinated mushrooms (recipe also on this website) on it, covered it with foil and put it back in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350.  It was perfect.  I don't regret pulling it out early.  You never want to overcook that cut of meat.

I never made rib roast before but wanted to have it for Christmas dinner instead of the usual ham or turkey. It is very expensive but very delicious. Everyone enjoyed it. It came out perfectly and I was able to just let it roast itself and enjoy the day without hovering nearby.

I used this recipe to make our Christmas dinner. I was very apprehensive about using this recipe because the rib roast was very expensive and my husband wasn't sure it was going to work out. But it was amazing, everybody loved it.  The roast had a perfectly seared exterior and tender interior. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

We had 7 rib Prime rib...this method worked perfectly..we had medium rare meat cooked it for 37minutes the last roasting..it was beautiful..I let it rest for 10-15 before carving. Follow this exactly as written and you will be perfect if you have a tiny roast or no bones it this may not work as well.

I agree the method is completely scary...but trust the process.  We bought a 6 lb roast for Christmas dinner and we were scared to death we were ruining the roast!!  Luckily, we have two ovens because this does dominate the oven for 5 hours, but it is restaurant worthy Prime Rib.  We cooked for about 50 minutes once we turned the oven back on and the ends were perfect for those that like a little more done, and the center was amazing for my daughter and my husband, who prefer medium rare!!  You won't be disappointed!!

Absolutely wonderful recipe ! The trick is to NOT OPEN THAT  OVEN DOOR ! Believe me, you won’t be disappointed! I let my prime rib sit out on the counter top for 2 hours to get to room temperature before placing it in the oven ( it was 12.5 pounds ) and reheated it for 40 min after letting it sit in the oven for 3 hours , and it came out perfectly medium rare ! I also had it marinating in the fridge seasoned for 2 days before cooking it !

Did not use any butter since had fat on top. Rubbed with 2 parts sea salt, to 1 part garlic powder and black pepper. Cook on bottom oven rack. Used thermometer and it reached 134 after the 2 hour wait time. Roast was 8.25 lb and cooked 42 minutes. Cooked perfect. Served with au jus and horseradish sauce.

Just finished Christmas Dinner and the star of the show was the standing rib roast! Our roast was 10 lbs. and bone in.  I followed the directions ALMOST exactly. I added two fresh rosemary sprigs to the roasting pan because we love the aroma it adds. Because we had a large roast, I increased the second cooking time to 45 mins. It was perfect. the middle section was medium rare (about 20% of the roast), the rest of the roast was medium with the end pieces medium well (just the end inch or so).  Couldn't have been easier. I added my sides to the oven the last 20 mins of cooking and that didn't seem to upset the process at all. I will absolutely use this method from now on!

Mine was a bit over 10 pounds, so I cooked it for 1.5 hours instead of 1 hour, shut it off and followed the rest exactly.  It was FABULOUS, my husband said it was the best he's ever eaten, including the one at our favorite restaurant.   It was the first time I ever made a rib roast, and the instructions scared me a bit, but they are perfect!

Critical brother and husband, gourmet cooks, loved this. With a 2 1/2 pound roast followed another reviewer's notes for timing, 30 min at 375, turn off oven, leave for two hours, then back at 375 for 20 minutes.  A winning cooking method.

I like this one, it's easy and you can leave it in the oven more hrs than most. Which is good for when you want to start it early but don't have family coming until LATER in the day.

I followed the recipe to the letter, being the first try.   Had a 5.75 lb roast  so I timed it for  40 minutes on the second  roasting.  It came out perfect!   Read several of the positive and critical reviews and decided it was worth a try, paying attention to the additional weight.  Everyone, including myself, loved it.  Tender, moist and perfectly seasoned.  Thank you!

Followed instructions exactly for a 6+ lb roast with a few sprigs of rosemary and garlic cloves added. The family voted this the best Christmas Eve dinner ever! Ridiculously easy! A relaxed cook is a happy cook!

Which me luck, first time making this.  Sounds yummy and easy, will let you know. So far we will give it a full rating but will go down depending on outcome.  I did add garlic and a little broth, hoping I didn't mess things up.

I had a 5-lb roast and followed directions, although like others I was a bit skeptical. For those who like reallllly rare meat, it was fine. For me and another who took the end pieces, it was still too rare. And it was not as tender as I like my meat, but that could have been just the roast itself.

My oven has an interior fan that runs to cool down the oven when the oven has turned off.  Any suggestions?  Should I keep the temp at the lowest-170?

One of my favorite recipes. I have made this for Christmas for 4 years now and it is perfect every time. Anyone that says otherwise did something wrong with this very simple recipe. You can't go wrong if you follow the directions. I think I will try a different rub this year as some others have suggested.

I have used this method successfully about 6 times on a variety of sizes. I do find size matters and can affect your cooking time perhaps by 10 minutes on the second heating. Other factors that may affect your outcome include  the length of time your meat sits out before roasting,  the accuracy of your oven temperature, and perhaps the type of roasting pan.  I'm not sure why some reviews are saying the  meat was tough. I have had success each time, but I use a meat thermometer to gauge if I need a few minutes more or less cooking time. This time I took it out at 132 degrees. Perfect-we like ours rare (not bloody) with a slice at the end for those liking it more medium. I have found the most luck with meat that has the bones cut off and then tied on. It makes cutting so much easier and I think it helps to have the meat elevated just a bit since I use a regular roasting pan  to prevent grease splatters. Like others, I add  Rosemary and don't use salt since I encrust the entire meat in kosher salt and then remove the salt after cooking and sitting for 10-15 minutes. (I'm not sure if this increase my odds for success, but I'm  sticking with the addition of the encrusting of salt-just be sure to remove the salt. The salt looks burnt, but the meat under it is perfect and is so tender!)

For the longest time I wanted to make a Prime Rib, and finally did.  Used this recipe and although my husband was very skeptical to say the least, this turned out AWESOME!  Rib Roast was just about 6 pounds, used this recipe exactly and it was so good.  And YES, avoid temptation, don't open the oven.

Only change, since I didn't have garlic salt, used rosemary with the dry rub, and then rubbed with minced garlic..  Yummy!!!  Thank you!

I make this for Christmas every year! This is the best possible method to do it. I make it in my Breville Smart Oven to free up my full size oven. To keep the husband from sneaking peeks I do the first step, turn off the oven then cover it with a quilt. Perfect every single time.

Hands down the best cooking method for prime rib! I followed the recipe exactly. I wondered if the roast would brown well and it was perfect. The fat layer was crispy, the meat was so tender and perfecty medium rare.

In addition to the spices listed, I added 1/2 teaspoon of Rosemary to the rub and it was delicious! I did put a piece of tape over the oven door as a solid reminder NOT to open the door. I had an 8 pound, bone-in roast and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare in 50 minutes (on the second roasting). I have a few family members that like their prime rib a bit more well done, so I heated up a saute pan with some au jus and cooked their slices about 30 seconds on each side for medium well. It was tender and juicy. I will never again cook a prime rib any other way!

My husband wanted to try this recipe on our rib roast for Christmas dinner with our grown children.  I was very hesitant, but who's not hesitant with a $100 piece of meat??  We decided to make ours in an electric roaster to free up our oven.  We had an eight pound roast and probably should have extended the initial cooking time a bit more on the front end as we had to extend it on the back end to achieve our desired temperature.  The beef was wonderful, though!  All of the young people raved and even one said it was the best meal she'd had in years (this is from people who eat a lot of mac and cheese!).  It was delicious and we'll definitely use this method again in the future.

My mother cooked a standing prime rib every Christmas.  I now keep up with the tradition.  I use salt and pepper to season the outside.  Instead of powdered garlic, I use fresh garlic, cut the cloves in half, rub it on the outside and then make slits in the meat and stuff the garlic in the holes.  I use a meat thermometer and cook to medium rare.  It is the best!!!

This is the roasting method used by my mother for many years' worth of delicious Christmas dinners.  It has become my preferred method, too. It is ridiculously easy, yet it renders a perfect prime rib roast.  Meanwhile, you're free to focus on the side dishes. Highly recommended.

If you like one that is like you would get in the finest restaurants you will get yourself a good meat thermometer and take it out at 115.  This is the one time you really need a thermometer.  It will continue cooking for quite some time after you take it out of the oven, so let it rest 20 minutes and chow!!  It is that simple!  No turning the oven off and then on for reheating, not necessary!

I agree with the seasonings - the fewer, the better.  It's all that's needed.  The cooking, however, I don't agree with.  The first time I bought a prime rib roast, I bought it from a butcher shop.  The price wasn't the cheapest around, but the butcher's experience is priceless.  It's been a long, long time ago.  But I remember him telling me to brown it, start roasting at 500 degrees for a short time; turn it waaay down (275 or 300) for 20 minutes/pound (I like it rare).  My point is that I would find a butcher and ask them for the roasting directions.

This is really a no fail recipe. I chop fresh herbs and use fresh garlic minced with a little olive oil I make a paste and spread it on; let it sit with that while it comes to room temperature and then follow the recipe.

WOW!!!!! I was very nervous about making my rib roast using this method.. Having said that it was HANDS DOWN THE BEST  of all of the rib roasts I have made! It was done perfect! 

* We like our roast more on the rare side so I did take off about 30 mins of the closed oven part of the recipe.

I made this last year for the first time on Christmas. I was so nervous because, as everyone knows, this is NOT a cheap cut of meat. I was afraid I was going to mess it up! Plus, the directions had me questioning whether or not it was a good idea. But it came out absolutely perfect! We're not a "rare" family when it comes to meat, so I wanted it medium. When it was time for the last step, I actually kept it in the oven about a half an hour longer than the directions say. I am cooking this again this Christmas!

Wow....like other reviewers, I was skeptical with the "slow roasting process" but it turned out PERFECT!!!! The only difference I did with the recipe was I pressed fresh garlic and loaded that and Montreal steak seasonings about 2 days before baking to let marinate in the fridge, turning every once in awhile to let the juices coat it evenly.  It was delicious!!!

My first attempt using this recipe and my new GE Pofile oven. I made an 8lb boneless roast and cooked per the directions except I used the convection roast feature. At the end of the second roasting the internal temp was 123 F so I continued roasting until 145 F.  Let it rest, when I sliced it the roast was medium but went to medium wel on the plate. Tender and delicious but a little over cooked for my taste. Next time it comes out @ 125 F and rests for 20 minutes.  
PS the crust was to die for!  Love the convection roast feature.

This was fantastic! I got a 2 1/2 lb. rib roast and followed the method with a couple of tweaks because of the size. After rubbing down with a bit of olive oil, I dusted all sides with Penzy's Beef Roast seasoning mix, put it on a small roast rack with some water and put it in our pre-heated to 375ºF Breville Smart Oven. I inserted  a meat thermometer. Once the internal meat temp reached about 111ºF (58  minutes later), I turned the oven off and let the roast sit inside with a note on the handle threatening loss of limb if anyone opened the door. :-D  After 3 hours, I turned the oven back on at 375ºF and when the thermometer reached 140ºF, I removed the roast and let it sit for about 20 minutes before slicing. It was fantastic! Great flavor and very easy! So much so, that this is one that is going into the regular rotation.

I have made this  Foolproof Rib Roast Recipe over 15 times and each and every time it comes out perfectly! The meat is tender, juicy and a perfect medium rare. Resist the urge to peek! I use different seasonings on my roast, choose what suits your taste and be assured this will be your "go to" recipe especially when you have guests! I just can not give this recipe enough stars you will LOVE it!

My family tend to be beef snobs having been raised eating beef raised by them. I am currently out & had to buy from the store. I didn't tell anyone. I followed this exactly and everyone just finished eating. They are all saying it is the BEST they have ever eaten. When I asked if there was anything I could have done to make it better no one could think of anything. I especially liked the fact that I didn't have to have the oven blazing all day to cook. Also I didn't have a rib roast and it was still fantastic! If I could give more stars I would.

So simple yet so perfect. I went to the local market and got me an 8 pounder. I had them separate the meat from the bone and they also threw the seasoning in there. That definitely made cutting easier and also enhanced the flavor. I did have to cook the meat a bit more. Maybe about 40 minutes and still got it to a medium cooked center just like I like it. I will be stopping by for another roast to make for my mother's birthday and that will make my 5th for the year!!

FANTASTIC! Best recipe for perfect rib roast!  I made this for the first time over Christmas and was blown away at how perfect it turned out. It's a foolproof recipe for amazingly tender, juicy, and the perfect shade of pink roast! Hubby and grown son loved it! Making for a graduation in June. Pictures to follow!

As hard as it was to not open the oven - this worked perfectly on a 7 lb (3.1 Kg) roast!!  I'm glad I read the reviews and learned about NOT covering the roast.  Will do this again - special occasion recipe for sure!!

After overcooking numerous roasts in the past i tried this recipe a couple years ago. Works every time! The only thing I do different is change up the seasoning with some kind of herb type rub in the beginning.

Given other reviews, I had SO much hope for this recipe!  I followed the directions TO THE LETTER, and it was overdone.  Bummer.  That's a VERY expensive cut of beef for it not to turn out perfect.  The taste was great, so I may try again, but with a much smaller piece and attempt to juggle the timing.

Excellent!  I added rosemary and thyme to the rub as others have done and was very happy with the results.  The rub formed an flavorful crust and the meat was juicy and cooked just right.  I agree with reviewers that have said, "...the BEST..." and "...absolutely perfect."  I will use this recipe for prime rib in the future and will attempt to use in in my Weber Smokey Mountain cooker.

I,too, was hesitant to use this recipe.  But, my 6.5# roast turned out great.  My only glitch was probably my own doing.  At the 2.5 hour mark into the 3 hour waiting period, the roast temp had reached 118 degrees.  Since I wanted a rare center (125), I got nervous about leaving the roast in the oven since the temp was still climbing.  

I put the roast back in the oven at the 3 hour mark and turned the oven back on.  I cooked the roast for 30 minutes (didn't want to wait any longer, it was time to serve!) and the meat temp was only 119 degrees.  The roast turned out just fine with a rare to medium rare center.  I probably didn't need to remove the roast!

I was very tentative about using this recipe as I was working with a 12 lb organic rib roast, which was very expensive, as well as using this roast as part of our Christmas dinner. I followed the instructions exactly, and pulled it out at a temp of 135 degrees. I let it sit for fifteen minutes, then we sliced it and it was absolutely PERFECT! I was concerned when we turned the oven back on for the final reheat as the interior temperature was 130 degrees. It took about 40 minutes for the oven to reheat the meat and bring the temp up to 135, which made a lovely medium rare roast. Kudos for a great roasting technique!

I made this today for New Years Dinner.  Followed this recipe to a T and it was just awesome.  I read some of the reviews and took a few suggestions I gave it a olive oil rubdown followed by the spices listed and only used parsley,Montrial seasoning,garlic powder, onion powder.  I also used a can of beef broth for au jus. Rubbed it all over the roast and man alive all I got was thumbs up.  I did take it out a little early and let it rest for the required time and tented the roast.  The only problem is this recipe deserves more than 5 stars.  Thank you for a great recipe you will find my copy in the vault.

Awesome!  Used this recipe for 8.3# prime rib.  We like our meat medium rare and it turned out perfectly!  I did increase the end time to 55 minutes due to size of roast.  One of the reviews mentioned that this recipe won't work in a gas oven.  NOT true, I have a gas oven.  It was a true 'meat feast!'

I usually double the ingredients so I can make sure to cover the entire roast. When making a smaller roast I cut the cook time to 45 minutes and then it sits for an hour and 10 and then I turn on for 20 minutes. I haven't had a bad one using this recipe. It's delicious and everyone I pass it on to raves about it

Great Recipe BUT you need to use a meat thermometer AND cooking to an internal temperature of 140 F will result in an overcooked rib roast!  I cooked our 20lb rib roast following the recipe but removed when internal temp was 125 F, rested for 20 minutes (temp rose to 139 F), carved and served.  Roast was very good but medium.  Next time I will remove at 115 F.

Awesome, I added a little more to the rub as folows, 1T lemon pepper seasoning, 1 T paprika, 1 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1tsp dried Rosemary, crushed and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I followed the instructions as far as cooking and it turned out perfect.  Better than restaurant!

I have been using this recipe for years!  It always works.  BUT, use the thermometer to check meat--130 degrees is med-rare,  145 degrees is perfect--still some pink! (Adjust cooking/resting time for a smaller roast.) Use a rack and roast UNCOVERED, fat side UP.  It works in convection oven--but use regular oven setting if you can.  Add a good quality canned beef broth for more au jus and mix at the end.  I use LOTS more seasoning than this recipe.  Any steak or prime rib seasoning works. This year I did the largest roast ever--10.6 lb boneless prime rib--big bucks!   My whole gang loved it, even the grandchildren who had seconds.  Better than most steak restaurants.

Rib roast for Christmas dinner has been a tradition in our house for the last 20 years. When I received this recipe via e-mail from All Recipes I was intrigued. It is a method of preparing a rib roast that I had heard of but have never tried. My daughter was a little concerned that I was going to attempt this “new” method when we were having 15 people for Christmas dinner. I must say that was the best decision I made when planning this meal. The roasts (I had 2 x 7 lb roasts) came out perfect. Everyone loved it! I will be preparing Christmas dinner this way from now on! The only thing I might change is to reduce the cooking time, the roast was a little more well-done than my family likes it. On the other hand it was a perfect medium for my guest who prefer it a little more well done.

I had never cooked a prime rib before and used this recipe for my first-time effort and it was wonderful. All my Christmas Eve guests raved about it; perfect varying slices for individual tastes. Wish I'd taken a photo, it was beautiful.

I used this technique yesterday on a 5 lb rib roast. Luckily I used a digital thermometer as within 45 minutes at 375 the roast was at 125.  I turned off the oven and within a hour it was at 140.  At that point I opened the oven door to let the remaining heat out so the roast would not overcook.  I was not planning on eating for another two hours, so the roast had to sit in the oven, which was the original time frame.  It did stay warm and when we carved it two hours later it was perfectly medium rare and very juicy.  I served it was a hot au jus, so it worked out, and it was absolutely delicious.  I do have a convection oven, so that may have been a factor.  So just be aware that the time is not written in stone.

Works every time! This time we combined a stick of softened butter with some Montreal Steak Seasoning and spread it on the top of the roast before cooking. Delicious!

We cooked a 16.5 lb roast yesterday with this method and it worked great. Obviously we had to change the times, but after reading everything we would i opted to buy a themometer and cook the meat till the center was 222 degrees. Then shut the oven off for 3 hours then on till the center was 145. I pulled the roast out of the oven at 145 and it cooked to 152, perfect! 
If you are doing a different roast size this will work just fine as long as you mind the temp!

The cooking directions gave us a perfect prime rib. We had a 7 pounder. My son and I like ours medium, so we ate the "ends" and my husband and friend liked theirs medium rare - so they ate from the middle section.

We did vary from the prep directions. We sprinkled salt and pepper and then seared the roast in a skillet. Then we made small cuts in the roast and placed garlic gloves in the cuts. We made a rub of olive oil, minced garlic, kosher salt, cracked peppercorns and thyme. It made a really great crust. Looking forward to leftovers today!

In reference to how much time this recipe keeps the oven occupied, we ended up making 6 baked potatoes in the toaster oven. Worked just fine!

The roast turned out as described, but was terribly hard to carve.  I think if I make it again, I'll have it boned.  Does this affect the cooking method?

I used the time/temperature/door shut per recipe.  Oven temperature was indicated by an auxiliary thermometer as 365 F. (Oven set point was 380).  I guess I didn't know what to expect as the roast internals were decidedly red which was much too rare for my guests.  The outer layer of the meat was delicious!  I had to pan fry the rest to make it palatable for my guests.  (Still very tasty)  My big mistake was not to use a meat thermometer, which if there is a next time, I will do.
I'm not sure if I have an oven problem or not.

The taste was amazing!! However,  I used a 7+ pound roast. I cooked it for 1 hr 40 minutes at 375, let it rest for 2.5 hours then back in for 30 and it was basically still rare except the edges, so it went back in for another 30 minitrs and then was perfect. Had I used a 5 lb roast, I feel the instructions would have been perfect!

All I can say is WOW !!  My family loved loved loved this and so did I. It was one of the easiest yet most flavorful roasts I have ever made. I served gargonzola sauce.Together Amazing.
I did use See Salt, Garlic Pepper in my rub and then pour my Tuscan Olive Oil on top and let set for the hour.  
Again. Amazing and I highly recommend.

In my 27 years of marriage, I think I've made standing rib roast twice with such disappointing results, I never wanted to risk it again. But this year my husband was having nostalgic feelings of the Christmas roast his mom used to make - how good the house smelled, the seasoning on his favorite end cut, and I have to admit, my childhood had the same memories.  So we tried it again with 6.5 pound "choice" bone-in cut from Costco (not the really pricey "prime" that they had too, although I was tempted based on past experiences). I used Weber Gourmet Burger seasoning and followed Foolproof cooking schedule to a tee despite the skepticism of my mom, his dad and even hubby.  The house smelled wonderful for hours, the second cooking was about 35 minutes and gave hubby his medium end cut and the rest of us a medium rare middle and despite the original skepticism, by the time we cut it open, we agreed that with Foolproof we had brought back the Christmas dinners like Mom used to make.

My family RAVED about this! Being VERY discriminating steak eaters (Morton's and Ruth's Chris), I've never done prime rib at home in 33 years of cooking on my own. Adult sons voted prime rib when I gave them the choice, after I saw this post.  My family LOVED it! Both sons said, 'Dad would have loved this meal!' He passed away in Sept.':(... I had a 3 lb BONELESS roast. Added cup of beef broth to pan and kept all else the same.  My resting time was shortened by 45 min because of such a small roast. Also, only cooked for 35 min for a juicy pink center, medium layer surrounding that, and capped off by the crispy mm mm so good outer seasoned well done layer.
I did use a small rack, and did NOT cover. The broth and drippings made the perfect au jus, and served with horseradish and A1. I made the green bean 'casserole' in a large skillet on the stove, and scalloped cheddar potatoes  in the electric skillet. Threw the already baked rolls in the oven while the roast was finishing out of the oven for final 10 minutes. Oh, MAN, was this savory and satisfying! I'll make this every time there is a PRIME rib roast on sale, and my family already requested it for next year! Thank you, SALSIEPIE!!!

This was the first prime rib roast I've ever made but it turned out absolutely wonderful.  My husband kept teasing me about leaving it in the oven so long, but the meat was just the right temp.  I did put about 2 cups water in the bottom of the pan but it just dried up.  And the smell in the house....!!!

Great recipe!!!  Very easy and turned out great.  Next time I make this, I will cook to an internal temp of 140 degrees as we like medium rare beef, this way when it rests (and I'm making the side dishes it will get to 150.

Sensational - the meat was delicious and perfectly cooked. Couldn't have asked for more. I was worried that it wouldn't have a crust that I've gotten with other methods. It had a perfect crust - no need to worry.

I was skeptical and hesistant, but used this on Christmas day with friends coming.  It was exactly as advertised.  My roast indeed was perfectly cooked.  Probably will use more spice next time, but i am quite pleased.

Made this for Christmas dinner!  It was perfection!  My prime rib roast was seven pounds, so I added twenty minutes to the oven time with the oven off and twenty minutes at 375 degrees.

We even have enough for prime rib sammies!

I will definitely use this recipe next time.  Thank you allrecipes.com!

Absolutely excellent! like others, a test of will power to not open the door but the results were fantastic. Added onions, potatoes and carrots at the start--they were blackened on the bottom but otherwise caramelized and tasty!

I used an electric oven for the meat.  I was nervous it wouldn't cook right.  I wanted my oven to warm side dishes.  It worked like a charm.  I followed all the directions to a tee and my family thinks I'm a culinary genius!

I have never made a rib roast before, and was a little worried about ruining a good piece of meat.  The reviews sold me on this recipe and it did not disappoint!  Follow the directions and the meat will be perfect!  I did splurge and buy a digital thermometer / probe (one that has an external display)-- I would highly recommend that you do that.  It beeped when the meat temperature got to 145 and 10 minutes later, the knife just slid through the beautiful medium rare beef!  I did put the rub on the night before and put it in a zip lock bag in the refrigerator.  I used Rosemary, Montreal steak spice and garlic.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I think it will be a Christmas tradition from now on.

This recipe came out phenomenal.  Would do it again and again, it's that good and that easy.  The only drawback is that your oven is tied up for approx. 4 1/2 to 5 hrs.  Pouring liquid into the roasting pan is a no no as this constitutes steaming, not roasting.

I tried this method for cooking a 6lb bone-in prime rib roast today and it was RAW after following this to the T. I was very disappointed and embarrassed as I had company for dinner. We ended up cutting the roast into steaks, which was not an easy task considering it was warm and raw, and cooking them on the grill. Of course this made dinner late. I will never cook a prime rib roast like this again.

This is the BEST rib roast I have ever had! We used a Hereford 2 bone, 4.8 lb roast, and we used an All-Clad roasting pan with rack. I added a pinch of crumbled, dried rosemary to the rub. The crust was so great that my friends were cutting off the edges. Paired it with Alton brown's horseradish cream…OMG! Only thing is that Paula Deen (not a fan but still) should be given credit, as this recipe was originally posted by her.

This was the best recipe yet, but I was glad to have a probe thermometer with wire to the outside. After 2 hours standing in closed oven, the internal temp had reached 122*. I cranked oven to 375* to reheat and finish up, and after 15 minutes, the internal temp hit 124*. I pulled it out and let it stand on the counter for 10 minutes covered with foil. By the time we cut into it, the temp had risen to 126* which was PERFECT for us (we like our meat rare). Other recipes that started on a higher initial temp always disappointed us because the meat was too well done on the outside two inches. This turned out perfectly by monitoring the internal temp and believing that it was a true reading. We were cooking a 9.75 lb. roast.

Make prime rib this way every Christmas! Wonderful! And to the poster who said the recipe submitter should give credit where credit is due, saying this is from Paula Deen? Paula published this recipe in May 2007. The recipe was published here in December 2006. Wonder where Paula got it from, hmmm?

I am amazed that on every recipe there are people that are able to have totally different experiences than the majority. I can see where gas vs electric ovens  . .. along with altitude impacts cooking times.
But you would think people would soon learn to make adjustments.
But as a friend of mine used to say, " some people can mess up a crowbar ".  This was a fantastic cooking method and I can see where some people would want to change seasoning. Can't imagine it coming out dry unless you bought a piece of meat that absolutely had no fat in/on it.

I'd like to add to the other comments that using a remote grill / food thermometer might be a revelation regarding the condition of your stove's thermostat. My stove came with the house and is about 15 years old. I set the dial to 375, and found out by watching the grill input temperature that means anywhere between 350 to 410 degrees. Roast still turned out fine, but now I have a great excuse to get a new stove.

This definitely does not work well on smaller roasts.  I tried a 4 pound, and I followed exactly and it turned out well done.  Won't be trying it again.

I made a rib roast for my first time and decided on this recipe and it was AWESOME! My family loved it! I wondered about covering it as well, but because it was never mentioned in the recipe or in any of the reviews that i read previously, I just left it exposed…..I will definitely use this recipe again….the only thing I did that was a little different was I rubbed the roast with olive oil  before the actual "rub" and sprinkled a little rosemary on top as it was mentioned in a previous review. AMAZING

Turned out perfectly. 4 1/2 pound Costco rib roast. Let it rest  for about 40 minutes to make Yorkshire pudding. Turned  out  med-rare.  Perfect for 3 different tastes.

I use garlic and fresh rosemary that I blend together in a mini chopper.  I then mix this into beef base that I rub all over the roast before cooking.  I then sprinkle fresh black pepper all over the roast.  After this I follow this recipe verbatim and it turns out perfectly! !!  After cooking, I remove the roast from the pan and add water.  Voila, instant au jus.  People rave over my prime rib.

The only thing I did different was to stuff a few slivers of garlic into the roast before putting it into the oven.  I followed the times exactly the roast was perfectly rare in the center and medium rare near the edges.  Thank you for helping with an expensive cut of meat.

Perfect results! I followed this recipe exactly, and the roast got the most and highest praise from the family for any food yet- It really stunned 'em! (I might add- they're not easily pleased) My only caveat is that I ran very late with dinner waiting for that 145 degree mark- but it was perfect, and worth the wait. I'll just start earlier next time.

If making this please pay attention to internal temperature of meat.if you keep in oven until145 degrees and then let the meat rest it be at 150 at least- this is WAY past a medium roast. We are a medium rare crowd so I pulled it at 130 but it still raised to 140 before eating. Came out medium well. Overdone for my crowd. The positive reviews seem to be from people who like well done meat. For any medium rare people let the roast sit out at room temperature at least 90 minutes and consider pulling the meat at the second reheat at 120-125. It will raise at least 5 degrees after pulling.

I followed the recipe exactly thinking the roast would be rare but it was medium well. Most folks wanted rare so I was a bit disappointed for them. I like mine well done so the ends were perfect for me.

There are so many variations of this on line. I had a roast prime rib over xmas about ten pounds plus, I cranked the oven with the beef inside cold to 500F. Once the temp bell went I turned it off and left it in the oven for 6 hrs. Then I turned the oven on to 500F again until the ready bell sang and pulled it out, covered with foil for 15 minutes and sliced. Middle was medium rare and ends were medium well. The best ever!! Oh I forgot to say this was 500F Convection Roast with gas oven.

Not sure what happened??!!! I read all the reviews and had high hopes. I needed to make dinner sooner than expected so I decided to chance it and took the roast out after sitting in the oven for only 2 hrs.Imagine my SHOCK when it was registering an internal temp of 150?!  I just let it be and we ate it like that.  It actually wasn't bad at all, but what if i hadn't checked the temp?? it would've burnt to a crisp!  Is my oven off? I really have no clue :(

I used this for two 3-lb prime rib roasts in the same large roasting pan...on their own racks... and it worked.  Our grocery was out of 5-6-lb roasts, so we bought two smaller ones.  I cooked for 50 minutes after the gap period to arrive at medium to medium well state.  Thanks!  I will not be afraid of prime rib again!    I rubbed one with the garlic and salt and pepper, and I rubbed another with Namibian barbecue spice.   Lovely memory of our year there.

Simple prep - nothing to it.  4.6lbs came out perfect exactly as directed.  I had to leave it in a bit longer on the reheat with my oven.

My first time making a Rib roast. But I nailed it with this easy receipt. I did cut the time by 40 minutes and I'm glad I did because we like our meat medium rear.

I don't normally write reviews but I have to on this one! You really will doubt that the prime rib is cooking but I promise this really works!! I cooked a 13 pound prime rib following these exact instructions and it came out PERFECT!!! I was really worried that it wouldn't come out because it such a large piece of prime rib but it was AMAZING and made for the perfect Christmas dinner! As much as you want to doubt this recipe, don't! You'll be so pleased in the end! Everyone is right, don't open that oven door!

Made this for Christmas dinner last night and it was absolute perfection. Tender and juicy. Followed recipe exactly. It does not need gravy or au jus. Served with roasted potatoes, squash/apple/cranberry medley, green beans and cherry tomatoes (another allrecipes winner), tortellini (we are italian), rolls, and my husband's famous 'Aunt Jennie's green jello recipe.'

I made this today for Christmas dinner. It was DIVINE and absolute perfection. The only thing I did differently was I made a fresh garlic puree instead of using garlic powder. On the advice of other reviews I used a coarse sea salt instead of regular table salt. My husband and three grown sons all raved about it and have requested it be our new Christmas dinner tradition. Follow the directions exactly and it will turn out perfectly.  I used a 5.5lb roast

I did two roasts. I originally got a rump but wondered after reading some reviews if it would be good enough to give company so I ended up going back out and getting a rib roast and cooking them both. they were both about 4 lbs. I followed the directions exactly and used the hint another posted about cooking them for well done to 55 minutes on the second cooking time. the rump was done after about 1:20, but the rib roast still wasn't totally well done at 1:40.   The rump roast definitely did not compare to the rib as to texture as it was much tougher and less juicy than the rib. The taste of both though was excellent and the rib roast was so juicy.  I definitely know which roast I will be going for from now on.  I had put about 3 cups of beef broth in the bottom of the pan hoping to have au jus, but it was all gone and all that was left was the fat.our company ended up not coming so guess we will have a lot of leftovers which my husband doesn't mind.

If there were more stars I would give them to this recipe!  I can't say enough wonderful things about this prime rib.  It is so easy and, having made it a few times, It is foolproof.  I followed the cooking instructions EXACTLY and believe this is the secret to cooking it right.  I did cheat a little and added a teaspoon of dried thyme.  Wow!!!  It just doesn't get any better than this!  - Linda O.

This was our first roast we ever tried to make, we used, Chunk Beef instead because that's all we had. Oh, it was so delicious, we cooked it an hour less than the recipe calls for because my fiance told me that it's a thinner cut of meat. It was so delicious, we changed nothing except for the amount of time that it was in. Pay attention to the directions and do the whole rigmarole of turning off the oven and letting it stew in the oven for three hours, it helps keep it juicy. Do not open the oven, you will let all the heat and humidity out. Use the window or just trust it to turn out. I'm a very impatient cooker and eater I usually find a way to cheat time so I can eat faster but this is just one recipe that you cant' do that in. If you cook it too high or too long, the meat suffers, if you cook it not as long it's just not as good.

If there were more stars I would give them to this recipe. It is the best recipe I have ever cooked. I fixed this for a party of 35 for the first time. Followed the cooking procedures exactly. Couldn't believe that a 10 pound sirloin (boneless roast) would bake in the same time, but it was perfect. I did use my own spice mixture but it was the roasting part that I am so impressed with. Don't be afraid to try it. Season your own way, roast and enjoy

Worked as described - delicious.  I didn't have garlic powder so I mixed chopped garlic with the salt and pepper.  My husband was glad he didn't open the oven.  Gravy from the drippings was awesome also.

We do not eat beef much and loved it. They only thing I did different was that I stuffed the roast with garlic. It was absolutely delicious and the leftovers I used for pepper steak.

Yes, it tasted good- but I'm still concerned with the idea of leaving meat sitting out without refrigeration.  That being said, the roast timed out as indicated and that is always a huge plus.  Be sure to use a meat thermometer so you get it exactly rare/medium/etc.

I have a 7 pound boneless eye of the rib roast.  I read some reviews that said it works for boneless and others that say that it won't work.  I also have a new slide-in Kenmore range that has a fan that runs after the oven is shut off.  It is not a convection oven, it just has this fan that runs.  I wonder if that sort of oven cools off quicker.  Does anyone have any experience or suggestions?  I have used a recipe like this long ago and it worked great.

WOW! I used this recipe exactly as printed and my roast turned out fabulous. This was the first time cooking a prime rib roast and it was for Christmas dinner --so I was a little worried. Can't say enough good things ---- we will be doing this for many more Christmas dinners and probably a few in between!

I followed this recipe to the tee...5 pound rib roast, etc. The meat was well done when I opened the oven an hour early. Does not work! Do not try this. I have done this in the past with the oven temp at 275 and it worked with that. 375 is too high!

"Fool proof" is right!  I had my meat market season the prime rib, so I didn't used the seasoning in this recipe.  The instructions couldn't have been more perfect!

My family raved about the taste and tenderness of the meat...unparalleled!  Followed the directions completely.  I added Montreal Steak Seasoning to the rub.  A wonderful accompaniment to the meat was yorkshire pudding and green bean bundles wrapped in bacon, baked in a butter, brown sugar and garlic glaze....a most memorable Christmas dinner....

This was super easy to do and the meat was perfect.  Why would you chance making this any other way?  You can use any spices that appeal to you but the cooking method worked flawlessly.

I tried this recipe and it came out a perfect medium rare. I used more seasoning then the recipe called for and you should season to taste. Like a few others, I rubbed the lamb with EVOO before seasoning. I decided not to add garlic but I probably would next time. I did use Boar's Head Pub style Horseradish Sauce. Mmmm...

Yesterday, I took the cold left overs and sliced it thin for a Ciabatta Roll sandwich with thinly sliced red onion, lettuce and more Horseradish sauce. It was awesome. Only thing missing was a cheese (brie?).

Followed this recipe and got a well done roast. Was looking for the medium rare pictured and was sorely disappointed! Couldn't open the oven to check internal temperature. Won't make it this way again.

We tried other recipes that may have made more sense....nothing is as good as this one. When I shared the recipe with family....all they said is "I never would of thought of that" cooking then resting then cooking again. It is SO tender!! This recipe is awesome and will be the only one we use from now on! Thanks!!

Hi there, this recipe looks amazing. 
I do need some advice though. I will be making a 15 lbs roast, medium with very little pink for a family dinner. I appreciate any input on timings for this recipe. Thanks

Worked perfect. I also used a smaller roast and just cut the initial time down to 20 minutes then 2 hours and then 20 minutes again and it was perfect!

This is the first rib roast I ever cooked. It turned out fantastic. My roast was boneless and I followed the directions. This recipe is a keeper. I made a rub using fennel seeds and coriander, salt, pepper and garlic salt. Yummmmm.

I used this method last night on a 4lb eye round roast. The flavor was great but it was very dry. It was not necessary for me to do the reheat. It would've probably been perfect at the 3 hour point.
It's probably the bone that makes the cooking time longer

Amazingly wonderful!   I was scared to death to try this for the first time this past Christmas!  But, I decided to give it a try.  WOW!  Nice, crispy, seasoned crust and juicy, wonderful meat.  I can't wait to do this again!

I'm a novice and this was my first attempt at cooking a prime rib roast. It came out perfect and I will cook this again the same way. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this for my daughter's birthday today and although I've cooked many roasts before this has been the best one according to the birthday girl. My favorite rub for a roast is cracked black pepper,kosher salt, fresh thyme and a little canola oil. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, i will never cook a roast any other way.

I was skeptical/nervous at first due to leaving the roast in the oven for 3 hours when the oven is off. BUT I have to tell you, that was the best piece of Prime Rib I have EVER had. It was better than most of the prime rib I have ordered in restaurants. Will now not cook Prime Rib any other way. Was Perfect!! Thank you for sharing

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  THE.BEST.MEAT.I'VE.EVER.HAD.  PERIOD.  I like mine a litter rarer, so I'd do 30 mins on the back-end instead of 40 next time, but I can't say enough about this.  It turned out perfectly and was perfectly seasoned.

I was hesitant to cook my rib roast this way for the first time on Christmas Eve because of the long wait time in the oven, but it was FANTASTIC! Even mom was gushing about it. The meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. Preparation was a snap and the hardest part of the whole process was waiting for it to be cooked as the delicious aroma was filling the house. We served it with mashed red potatoes and garlic string beans, neither of which required the oven, so the loss of the oven for so many hours didn't matter. Will definitely make again. I did put a big red piece of tape across the oven door to keep away peekers.

I am rating this solely on the basis of the fantastic cooking method.  It was a huge hit!  I made my own rub with fresh crushed garlic, horseradish, olive oil and kosher salt-- but the convenience of starting this roast early in the afternoon-- turning it off to go to Christmas eve mass and only having to finish it when we got home- a total bonus.  I was worried, but this was SOOOOO fabulous.  Tasty, moist- perfect!

Absolutely delicious!  We like our prime rib medium, so I turned the oven back on for an hour.  Like a previous reviewer, I combined this recipe's cooking method and used the seasonings from Garlic Prime Rib, found on this site.   Perfect!

I thought that this recipe was great and will definitely keep it in the mix for our household recipes. The only thing that seperates me from giving this recipe 5 stars is that the meet wasn't very tender....but other than that, it was awesome! Thank you for sharing!

My meat thermometer registered the right temp, but when I took it out it was way too rare.  I'll be getting a new one.  Gave it another half hour and it was perfect.  I also added a half a teaspoon of Paula Dean's house seasoning.

I had never cooked a rib roast before and was very happy with the way this turned out for our Christmas dinner. I was leary about the cooking method, but the roast turned out juicy. I prefer my meat medium so I did have to increase the time at the end from 10 minutes to ~30 minutes to allow the roast to reheat and cook for just a little longer. I also added potatoes, carrots and pearl onions to the pan during the last 30 minutes, and I found out later my father added about 1/2 cup of water to the pan for the veggies. The carrots were still a little firm but the flavor was delicious after stewing in the roast juices. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy recipe with delicious flavor.

The recipe is great,except I had a hard time not peeking at the roast, which is why I only gave the recipe four stars. Also, which is no fault of the recipe, my roast was slightly larger than the reccommended size and was slightly rarer than we like, so I cooked it slightly longer.

This was my first attempt at a standing rib roast - I was very nervous as I made it for Christmas dinner with a very discerning crowd.  Let me tell you, I read the reviews and followed the directions.  The results were amazing.  My father (who is the king of beef) is still raving!  Resist the temptation of opening that oven door.  I had a 5.2 lb. rib roast that came out tender and pink.  The ends were very flavorful...I used some pepper, salt, oregano and montreal seasoning mix as per another reviewer.  YUMMY!  A DEFINITE KEEPER!

As with all the other reviewers, I was worried about the cooking method...would the meat be done? Would it be tender?  Well, it turned out fabulous!  I used the recipe for our Christmas rib roast and everyone loved it.  Will use again and again!

Yep...it was perfect! Hated that my oven was used up, but i threw the Roast in my warmed crock pot with a little beef stock left over from the pan drippings while everything else pretty much warmed up!  Easiest Christmas dinner ever!  THX!

I've never  tried cooking a rib roast before, and had mentioned this to the butcher.  To help me out, he inserted one of those pop-up timers in the roast.  I followed the instructions exactly, and was rewarded with a juicy pink-in-the-middle roast that was incredible.  I was worried when I finally removed the roast from the oven as the timer hadn't popped up.  However, after tenting the roast with foil and letting it rest 20 minutes, when I uncovered it the timer had indeed popped up.  I can't believe it came out so well, and that it was so incredibly easy!  Mine was a 5lb roast with ribs attached, cooked uncovered.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was my first time making a rib roast and I wanted to use the convection setting on my stove so I thought this recipe was perfect for it.  This was amazingly easy and the taste was outstanding!  I used a 4 lb rib roast, rubbed salt, pepper, and Monterey Steak Seasoning on it and followed the instructions.  The best Christmas dinner I have made to date, everyone raved about it for hours.  THANK YOU!

Wow. I had my doubts, but not only did this cook the roast perfectly, but people couldn't stop going on about how good it was, even hours after the meal. We ate a rib roast at a relative's house yesterday, and it wasn't half as tender as this. Amazing. This recipe is not only a keeper, but one to share.

Made this for Christmas dinner - beyond easy and came out excellent.  For the critics that claim that this was is Paula Dean recipe, a friend's wife gave me an almost identical recipe nearly ten years ago.

I picked this recipe because of the great reviews it was getting - and I discovered there was a reason for its high rating!  I had to roast a 9 lb boneless rib roast, and was unsure if the recipe would fit, but it did.  I added a cup and a half of water to the pan, as suggested by another rater, to make the au jus sauce afterward.  For this size meat, I probably should have let it sit for longer than an hour before roasting it, but it still came out fabulous.  After an hour, the internal temp was well below 100 deg F.  But, after about 2 hours with the oven off, the internal temp had peaked at 125 degF.  The oven temperature was 175 degF when I turned it back on again.  I only waiting 2 hours as opposed to 3 hours to turn the oven on again.  From the time I turned the oven back on to when the internal temp reached 140degF was about 30 minutes.  I took the roast out and it was PERFECT!  I deglazed the roasting pan with about a cup of red wine to make the sauce and it was delicious.  I highly recommend!

AMAZING!!  I was making dinner for some good friends that have a newborn and wanted something special.  This hit the spot.  I had always been afraid of rib roast/prime rib thinking it was complicated and hard....not so with this method.  The house smelled amazing all afternoon and evening, and the roast was so tender and flavorful.  Our friends raved at how good it was as well.  This is a keeper!!  I'll be watching for sales on roast from now on.

Came out pretty good. Ended up cooking a lot longer at the end, since it came out all bloody (even though it was only about a 3lb rib roast). I also used way more salt and pepper on the outside. Plus I studded it with garlic--something that probably added more than the garlic powder.

So this roast has very good taste. It is also very easy. I did use some minced garlic on it. Also, I skipped the salt and used Mrs. Dash's Garlic and Onion and Herb seasoning. I do have to say that I had a 6 lb roast and 4 hours was not long enough. It was rare in the middle, medium rare on the outside. I wish the instructions would have had a little better cooking times for different sized roasts. We cut our and then put 6 pieces at a time back into the oven in a glass dish for about 15 minutes. Kinda messed up my Easter dinner, though. Will make again, but will adjust cooking times.

This really is a foolproof way to cook a choice cut of meat. When you're spending this much on meat you really want to enjoy it's flavor and this recipe is perfect for that. Tender, juicy and flavorful!

Unbelievably easy and delicious.  I'll repeat everyone else, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR.  I added some garlic spikes to the roast and some beef broth for au jus.

EXCELLENT! I wasn't sure about this recipe but I tried it anyway for our family Christmas dinner. The family loved it! I actually made two in the oven at the same time. Turned out perfect! Have a meat thermometer handy to get the roast to your desired wellness. Follow the directions as stated and you will have a great roast.

Yummy recipe but needed about an extra 45 mins - 1 hr on the second cooking for my 9 lb roast to be medium rare.  For that size I'd extend the intial cooking by about 20 minutes and leave some wiggle room for how long the second cooking would take.  I'd rather have had it sit longer and rest than have my dinner late again.

BELIEVE all the great reviews...it DOES work!  The only down side is that if you only have one main oven, it's occupied for 5hours.  Just plan ahead!

I made this for a pre-Christmas meal with a few family members because prime rib roast was on sale and they loved it!!!  (I don't eat meat so have to go on their review).  My husband ate all the leftovers the next day, my father-in-law said it was one of the best rib roasts he'd ever had and my 3 year old ate it up without fuss.  It was very easy to make and I would definitely use this recipe again.

amazing! i took the roast out at 140 degrees and after tenting for 10 mins, it went up to 150... a bit too medium for us. next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) will take it out at 135 and hope to see medium rare! but still very tender and melt in your mouth texture.    overall an easy dinner that impressed guests who wondered if i had been slaving all afternoon. while roast we sitting in the oven, i prepared a salad, mashed potatoes, veggies, garlic toast and gravy in under an hour.

Seasoned it with some Emril Steak Rub and used termometer to roast until 145degrees. PERFECT, crusty yet delicious outside, tender and juicy inside. Plus only slightly pinkish center. BTW I did open the oven quickly to insert the oven's roasting probe after the 3hr off-time.

This is an easy & delicious way to serve Prime Rib.  It came out delicious & moist.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  I think there is no better way to prepare this.  You can season it up how ever you want but the trick of letting it stand of 3 hours in the oven in unbelievable.  Will be my only recipe for Prime Rib for now on.  Thanks

Absolutely fantastic! I've never heard of a cooking method like this, but the meat could not have been more perfect or delicious. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

OH MY GOSH!!!! If this wasn't such an expensive cut of meat I would live off this recipe! I was SO scared about this cooking method bc I didn't want to ruin it...it came out melt in your mouth perfect! I just had to cook mine longer bc i had a bigger cut...this is the only way I will ever cook rib roast!

I used this recipe yesterday for my 6 lb. rib roast and it worked exactly as the recipe said it would.  It was exactly 145ºF when it was time to take it from the oven.  The temp continued to rise while resting for 10 minutes and ended up at 155ºF.  My roast was still slightly pink in the center but it was definately not medium rare.      The rating of 4 stars is because the discription says 145ºF is medium rare when done..and it's not; 145ºF is medium.  Plus, it should have stated that the temp would continue to rise while resting, sending to to medium well when done.    My fault for not double checking a reliable source for internal meat temps as they relate to the desired outcome.  I will say, though, that this method sure is easy, but just misleading.

Used this recipe last night with a 3.5lb roast. It came out perfectly medium (no pink) as my honey prefers but still tender and juicy. I echo the suggestion of many reviewers to use a meat therm during the last cook.   Will it work with a pork roast??

I used a 2 1/2 lb. boneless roast.  Left in oven for 1 and 1/2 hours, then for 1/2 hour when I turned the oven back on.  In addition to the spices mentioned, I also added about a teaspoon or so of dried thyme.  GREAT recipe, and I'll definitely use again.  (and Yes, it WAS hard NOT to open the door, but the results are worth it)  My husband loved this!

Made for Christmas Eve and it was spectacular.  Everyone loved it, even the harsh critics! Used the recipe for the Garlic Prime Rib Roast on allrecipes.com, and this cooking method.

perfect if you want medium rare.  My husband likes everything well cooked so I did mine differently.  The part where you turn off the oven for 3 hours, I left it at 170 for an hour then turned off 1-1/2 hours then moved onto the next step.  That last step took forever to get to 160 degrees and we ate dinner late.  Outside seasoning delicious and oh so tender in the middle.  I didn't know that letting it sit out for 1/2 hour after done would still cook it so I guess I should've taken it out at 155 or so.

I made this exactly as the recipe indicated for the first time on Christmas Eve.  My family loved it.  My husband took the leftovers to a football party on Sunday, we sliced the remaining meat, put it in a dish with seasoned beef broth and warmed in the oven.  He took some horsey sauce and potato rolls to serve with the meat.   It was a hit at the party, the first thing gone.  We are making it again today for New Year's day dinner.  Thanks for this one!!  Allrecipes.com frequently makes me a hit in the kitchen and this recipe continued the tradition.

This recipe truly is foolproof if you use a themometer for the last cooking.  I made this last night for my husband and I and it turned out GREAT!  I was so nervous because this was my first standing rib roast and they ARE expensive.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  The 2nd time I turned the oven on, I timed it.  I cooked it 30 mts and checked the temp.  We like our meat on the medium side and the temp was at 143.  I put it back in for another 10 mts and checked and the  temp was 154 and I removed the roast from the oven.  It was very tender and flavorful.  This will become a tradition for us!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The only secret to making this perfect for your own desired degree of doneness is to invest in either a wireless or a wired digital meat thermometer that you can read outside the oven.  It will make it perfect every time.  Remember it will cook another 3-5 degrees when you take it out to rest.  I cook to 140...then it is 145 (med rare) after 20 min resting (leave meat thermomer in until ready to serve).  YUMMY...will never do a prime rib any other way.

I am not much of a cook but wanted to have a rib roast for Christmas dinner this year. i tried this recipe with a 6.5 # rib roast. i followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect.medium to medium rare. it was wonderful. i served it with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh sauteed green beans which could be on the stovetop. If i can do this, anyone can.

I must say, using this recpie was an act of faith on my part... faith that the 300 other reviewers were not crazy. Well, faith in the allrecipies community worked. I had never made a rib roast in my life, and I tend to always over cook meat. I followed this recipe to the letter and it was PERFECT! I couldn't believe it when i cut into it and it was a perfect medium. My guests ate so much that they were too full for dessert! I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this roast for Christmas dinner; my chronically late brother showed up 5 hours late and ruined the timing. The roast was raw in the middle and we put it back into the oven for another half hour. The outside meat was delicious anyways and everyone raved about it. If that happens to me again, I will leave the oven at a low temperature like 250, so the roast will retain some heat.

OMG!!!! I was not sure about  how this was going to turn out, but to my surprise this was the best prime rib that i ever had! I rubbed olive oil all over my roast and marinated it with some rub and let it stay in the fridge overnight, i took it out one hour before it was time to put it in the oven and i followed the instructions for cooking it to the tee and i was VERY PLEASED!!!! this was my first Prime Rib to cook on my own and I will make this a tradition at my home! Thanks for the easy recipie!

I thought the flavor was wonderful, but my roast was overcooked. My roast was smaller - only 2 pounds. I cooked it according to the instructions and during the last 30 minutes, when I turned the oven back on, I watched the thermometer like a hawk. I pulled it out at 146 degrees. I suppose I should've cooked it for less time initially - something I'll try next time.  However, that isn't the recipe's fault. So, I'm giving it 5 stars because the flavor really was wonderful and it was very simple to put together.

Amazing!!!! We made this for our boxing day bash, and it was perfect. The only change we made was putting it on the BBQ for the 30 mins before serving. It was medium rare all the way through. We will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe.

Wow!  Thanks for this perfect set it and forget it recipe.  We prepared our rib roast exactly as the recipe call for and it was PERFECT!!  I can't believe how simple this was and enabled us to spend time with the family instead of supervising the meal.  I was very very impressed with this recipe!

This was the best way I have ever cooked prime rib roast.  It was moist inside and crusty on the outside.  I did as another lady did and added some beef broth to give more au jus. Easy, easy, easy!

Outstanding recipe, I will be using this one again.  It was easy to prepare and was just as advertised, foolproof.  I did coat the roast with olive oil prior to adding the rub.  I also added a teaspoon of rosemary to my rub.  The whole family raved about the roast, as it was the hit of the dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicioso! loved it, followed some tips in adding rosemary and the Mcormic's Montreal Steak seasoning. Only down side took forever and my roast turned out a little chewy, I don't know if it's the meat or if it's because we altered to recipe a bit to fit out 3 pounder. But great recipe, recommend to anyone!

I tried this for Christmas yesterday. It was the first time I ever made a rib roast. I only had a 4 pound roast and followed the entire recipe to a T. The only thing (ONLY THING) was that 145º was a bit too well done for my crowd. It was a wonderful recipe and everyone loved it.

Like other reviewers, I was hesitant to use this method. I had only a 4 pound roast, but followed the directions to the letter. It was fabulous!  Everyone loved it. It turned out a medium rare, just like how we like it, and registered about 150+ degrees, internal temperature.  I baked all the things I had to bake before I put the roast in the oven, and then just used the microwave to heat those things up. Thanks for sharing!

I was really skeptical about the cooking method, but it has such good reviews I decided to give it a shot.  I served this for Christmas dinner with my family and my in-laws and it was amazing.  I'll definitely be making this many more times.

Just to add there were some changes I made to the rub I used Montreal Steak Seasoning, Kosher Salt, Italian Seasoning, and Minced Garlic. Also I poured 28 oz. Swanson Beef Stock, 2 cups of Red Wine, cut up 1 yellow onion, minced garlic and Italian seasoning in roaster pan before placing roast in the oven. For those of you who love flavor try it this way it was excellent. We have another 8 lb roast in the oven now. WoooHooo good eating tonight.

Made it for Christmas dinner - The best prime rib we have ever had!!  Rubbed coarse black pepper on the fatty side also.  Followed roasting instruction exactly and roasted the last 25 min. for perfectly medium rare meat. Served with an au jus.  Fabulous!

OH MY GOSH!! This was fantastic--please believe the instructions this DOES work--I did add more spice than it called for to make a INCREDIBLE crust.  We had it for Christmas dinner last night and my husband wants it again for New Years Eve for our company. Thanks again

Christmas dinner was the best we've ever had thanks to this wonderful recipe. I made a 6 lb. roast, cooked it an hour, turned off the oven for 3 hours, turned it back on and cooked about 45 minutes. I let it sit for about 20 minutes before carving. It turned out to be a perfect medium in the middle. It was delicious!

Followed the directions exactly, with some trepidation during the 3-hour in oven period, as we were afraid it would get cold.  Excellent, though, and enjoyed by all.  Thanks for sharing!

Definitely fool proof and delicious!  My first time cooking a  rib roast and received rave reviews by all.  I followed exact directions with a 5.5 lb roast.  I did have 3 sides that needed to be cooked at 350 degrees for 30-60 minutes, so I put those in immediately after removing the roast after final 35 minute reheating.  Roast sat for an hour before carving while the sides were cooking and it was still delicious. Was exactly 135 degrees when I removed from oven and 145 degrees when I carved it.  Perfect!

This is absolutely the best prime rib I have ever had. I made it for Christmas dinner. It was so tender and juicy. The only thing different I did was add italian seasoning to the rub. The next time I make this I will add water to the pan for the juices.

I have been reading lots of reviews, and this seems to be a great recipe! I only have a 3.5lb beautiful rib roast, and I don't want to mess it up, so I'm gonna try some suggestions: coat with seasoning, sit for 1 hour then roast in preheated 375 degree oven for 1 hour...turn off and let sit undisturbed for 3 hours. Then turn oven back on to 300 degrees (adjusted for a smaller roast) and cook for another 30-40 minutes. I also do not have a decent thermometer, so I'm going by the timing. Does this sound right? I hope so, it's going in the oven right now. I'll let you know how it turns out! Thanx, everyone, and happy holidays!!

This was my first attempt at prime rib.  Got rave reviews from my family tonight!  They've asked that it become a new Christmas Eve tradition.  I actually did two separate 5 lb roasts in one pan, and just doubling the rub recipe.

Does anyone know if this recipe will work in a newer oven with a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off.....or will it cool down too fast and not cook the roast. I tried this in my older oven and it turned out great.

This was good and a very basic recipe for roast.  I will try more herbs/spices next time.  The method was a bit unorthodox because I just hate waiting that much for food.

I was actually looking for a recipe to make a rump roast.  I used the suggested spices and added a tsp. of crushed rosemary.  Then browned on all sides and put in 1 can (14 oz.) of lower sodium beef broth to the 2.25 lb. roast (in a dutch oven).  It took 1.25 hours to get to 160 degs. and then I let it rest.  The roast was very flavorful.  I also added cut up potatoes and sliced mushrooms to the dutch oven the entire time the roast cooked and then browned the potatoes while the roast rested.  (I didn't leave the roast in the oven for 3 hours; didn't have time! :)  Very good!

I give the 5 star rating for the first time I cooked this, it was awesome.  The second time, I didn't adjust it enough for the weight of the meat, and neither my husband or I are crazy about well done beef, but it still tasted good!
