A traditional recipe for basic cream cheese pound cake with a little variety in the flavoring and a half cup less sugar.  The blend of almond and nutmeg didn't appeal to me, so I just stuck with boring old vanilla - and added about 1-1/2 cups of frozen blueberries. What peaked my curiosity, really, was the lesser amount of sugar than the standard recipe calls for.  Since sugar has a lot more to do with a baked product than just its sweetness (like volume and moistness, for example) I was interested to see how it might affect the final result.  Well, apparently reducing the sugar by this half cup was not enough to affect its quality in any way.  It was delicious.

This is the pound cake recipe I wanted.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to omit the almond extract (didn't have any) and the nutmeg.  I added a little more than a tablespoon of pure vanilla extract.  I baked in two loaf pans and the texture of the cake is exactly like any store bought -- but better!!!  This is at the top of my cake recipes from here on in!

Don't have cake flour in the pantry?  No problem.  For every 1 cup of all purpose flour, remove two tablespoons of flour and replace with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  So for this recipe, I measured 3 cups all purpose flour, removed six tablespoons of flour and replaced with six tablespoons cornstarch.  Sifted together and presto, cake flour!

I made this recipe for a cookout with my boyfriends family. It was a hit to say the least. I was quite pleased with the result. I drizzled straberry glaze over the top and scattered fresh sliced strawberries on top of that and then sprinkled it with confectioners sugar. It was delicious. Unfortunately this is not the recipe I was looking for but it was a great substitute. A woman i used to know made an angel food cake that had cream cheese in the recipe and it was heavenly. I cannot find anything like it and i am not able to get it from her anymore. Anyway, this was agreat cake. Thanks for making me look good with the family. a couple people swore i had to have bought it cause normal people don't bake like that from scratch. Box mixes has ruined the world of baking in my opinion.

Followed the recipe almost exactly...which I never do. We have nut allergies so I doubled the Vanilla and left out the Almond Extract! I couldn't resist adding a bunch of the beautiful fresh blueberries that I had just bought. Poured 1/2 the batter into my tube pan and sprinkled blueberries on the batter (3/4 cup?). Covered the blueberries with the remaining batter and baked for 60 minutes - not done. It needed the full 80 minutes. 18 year old started cutting it before I could photograph it (really pretty) and took one bite, closed his eyes and said; "BOMB!" THAT FOLKS - IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS! Smells amazing and pretty too. 5 Stars!

This was such an easy cake to make!  The texture was wonderful, almost that European taste!  I made toothpick holes on the top of the cake and then put a simple glaze of 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of lemon juice which I boiled, then poured over the top of the cake. It was a huge hit at the party some people asking for thirds!  This is a keeper for sure!!!

I made this this past weekend for company and it was delicious. I made the following changes: (1) added one tablespoon of lemon juice, (2) zested half of a small lemon into the mix, (3) only put 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract, (4) used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and next time i would probably omit both since i didn't notice a difference. almond extract is extremely strong and i just didn't want to overpower the cake. turns out the 1/4 teaspoon was enough for us. next time, i might only bake it for 70 minutes though because the edges were a little brown at 80; cake was still moist though. 

i topped this with a basic vanilla glaze but next time i think i will just make a fresh whipped cream to top it. and there WILL be a next time. i'm so happy i tried this even though there aren't 2,000 reviews for it=) it's great!

I grew up making pound cake from scratch, being raised by my grandmother. This recipe is by far one of the best I've come across in a while. It is quick, easy, and is delicious! I reduced the sugar by one half cup and added 4 oz of whole buttermilk. I used cardamon in place of the nutmeg and doubled up on vanilla extract, omitting the almond extract. This is my new base cake recipe. Keep them coming, Tony!

Tony,  This is the BOMB!  Great, dense, PERFECT pound cake.  Chose to use lemon extract b/c I don't like almond extract. Super as written.  No need for any change. Can't believe this doesn't have a bazillion reviews.  Keep the recipes coming, Tony.  OH, and thank you.

Instead of almond extract I used lemon, and then added another teaspoon of lemon on top of that. Wished it had even more though... Next time I'll add zest. Very good!

Wow! What an amazing cake. I  made this cake because it was snowing outside and thats when I do my best baking. This recipe is easy to follow, well read and is just plain easy. I usually make a brown sugar pound cake, but I think that this is our new favorite! I followed the recipe and instructions as is, simply because I  don't think that anything that I could have added anything that could improve the quality and taste of this delightful cake. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

This is a great recipe, the guys at my husband's job request it often lol.  While I usually make it in a bundt pan, I'm using it for petit fours and thus needed to do a 9x13 inch pan.  It effected the baking time a little, I started checking it for doneness after 60 minutes, and it was perfect!  It held up very well to the slicing and spreading and icing also :)

This is a great pound cake.  Made it for the first time, and it is definitely going in the vault!  Omitted the nutmeg, and made a blackberry compote to pour on top.  Absolutely great with an old fashioned flavor.

Dee-lish!  Used two loaf pans and baked 1 hour.  Would use half the almond next time as I was using as a shortcake and it was a little overpowering.  Would leave as is if not.

The cake was very moist on the inside and a nice crust on the outside. The only change made sugar was increased to 3 cups.  The next time I may experiment with a different combination of extracts.  I still loved the texture and flavor of this cake.

Fabulous pound cake and so yummy!  Read many reviews, and I cut the sugar back by 1/2 cup, added extra vanilla extract instead of the almond extract, and added 1 Tablespoon lemon extract to the mixture.  Baked in 2 greased loaf pans, so that we can freeze one for later!

This is a great basic recipe, The only thing I did different was I used 3 cups of sugar and I omitted the nutmeg and almond extract. Then I baked it in my angle food cake tube pan, I also use a lemon glaze and the cake was amazing!!!

I tried this recipe this past Sunday for Easter.  YUMMMMY!!! And it was my first time making a pound cake EVER...but it was pretty easy.  I guess the hardest thing is remembering to take the eggs out ahead of time so that they are room temp.  Well that cake is long gone so I am making another one tonight.  The only difference is I will take it out at 75 minutes instead of 80.

This was a very nice cake, melt in your mouth crumb, somewhat sweet. Would omit the nutmeg next time as it felt out of place. Omitted the Almond Extract, did double Vanilla. Baked in approx 65-70mins in a Bundt Pan. Thanks for recipe.

Yum-O! This was really good. It was moist and had a good flavor. We did not have almond extract though so that was omitted. We made a lemon glaze to drizzle lightly on the top. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe is simple and makes a really good pound cake. The nutmeg and extracts give it a unique taste.  I liked it with strawberries and whipped cream but a plain slice is just as good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent cake. I had all ingredients at room temp and followed the recipe exactly, omitting the nutmeg, though. I used a Bundt pan. Had some sliced almonds on hand, so I sprinkled a layer in the bottom of the pan first, then poured in the batter (more like spooned it in as it was very thick). Needed the longer baking time. After cooling the cake, I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and brought it to a neighborhood gathering. Everyone loved it! Delicious!

I live at 6200 feet so I upped the temperature to 350 and cooked for 68 minutes.  It turned out amazing. Super moist but held together great.  There is a lot you can do with this recipe.  Thank you.

When I made it in a loaf pan, I Checked it at 80 mins and it still wasn’t ready. So I had to cook it an additional 25 mins. 
Used all almond and no vanilla and it was still good.

Wonderful recipe will surely use again! The only changes that I made is the pan sizes and a few small sprinkles of orange peel that we had recently dried. Our granddaughter help me make the batter. She loved sprinkling the orange peel in the batter We all enjoyed our own individual cakes with strawberries and whipped cream. I do not have a large bundt pan so I used the one I had and 4 individual cake mold pans. Overall it was very good and made some precious memories too!!

Family loved the flavor and texture.  Tweaked just a little by adding 2 tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice to the batter and 1 tablespoon to the glaze.  Since I'm at high altitude, baked for an hour and 35 minutes.

This recipe is great! Instead of doing an actual cake, I did cupcakes. I had to adjust the baking time to 30-35 minutes, which is nice. I did the lemon glaze on one batch, and a pumpkin spice glaze on another. I brought a batch 3 dozen) to a work party with both kinds of glaze, and they were an instant hit! So versatile too! I'll be making this a lot!

It was good, but I was not wowed.  Followed recipe exactly except for reducing a tad bit of sugar.   I liked the ricotta pound cake recipe on the blog Proud Italian Cook better than this.

This pound cake made me proud.  It was my first time ever baking a pound cake.  I  had to bring a cake to my church and decided I was going to make my own. Omg,they loved it,it was gone in a flash.  Everyone was surprised I did it  being that my mom is the baker. It was simple to follow and so good.  I was skeptical about the nutmeg but choose to follow the instructions and I'm pleased I did. Thanks for a delicious pound cake,I'm ready to try another one,I'm a big girl now...

The cake was easy to make but once it cooled and I took it out of the freezer and cut it, it wasn't the same all the way through. It still had a good taste to it but I'm not sure how to get the cake to have the same consistency all the way through.

Good pound cake with great flavor, simple to make. However I was not exceedingly pleased with the density and moistness of the cake. Next time I wil addl cream cheese instant pudding mix  to the batter to try  and lessen the density and maybe add a bit more moistness to the cake.

This recipe is great. It's nice, dense, and flavorful. 60 minutes definitely wasn't enough, but I think that 80 minutes was a tad bit too long in my oven. I'll do 75 minutes next time (I definitely plan to use this recipe again). Thanks for sharing!
