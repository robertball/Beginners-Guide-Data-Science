Instead of just slitting the jalapenos, I cut out a wedge from the top and then replace the wedge after adding the filling and before wrapping with bacon. Note: if you do too good a job of scraping out the seeds, the peppers lose most of their "heat". For those that prefer screaming hot finger food, I leave about half the seeds in some of the peppers and mark them with red toothpicks.

I thought these jap poppers were delicious. We made them for New Years. I cooked them in the oven and they turned out great. I did end up cooking them a little while longer than the recipe said, and then broiling them until brown. The filling was mild, the first night (but I refridgerated some and made them the next day and they were slammin' hot. I froze some of the others (obviously this recipe make a gillion!) So I am interested to see if they turn out great too. Great recipe!! Thank you.

Great recips, I've been making these for years. I put Chorizo in mine. I'll put 10-12 in my smoker when I'm grilling ribs or brisket and slow cook them. The bacon shrinks around the poppers, then I slice them into wheels. I've also put them into a 250 degree oven and had the same reults (without the great smoky flavor though).

Man those are good peppers!  Ate 10 of 'em in on shot!  Screaming, though I'm not so sure of.  I cooked them in the oven and the cooking must have taken the "scream" out of them.  If your cooking them in the oven you might consider adding come crushed red pepper flakes or something if you truly like these to be hot.  I honestly like them just the way they were, just mild and flavorful.  I will make 50 of them next time!

I initially thought basil and sundried tomatoes were an odd combination for jalapenos, but these were excellent!  I used oil-packed sundried tomatoes that I rinsed and added a clove of garlic.  These were so tasty. . . I shared them with a friend who made them the next night for a get-together and they were a hit!

These are amazing! My husband and I are huge "hot" fans and this recipe does the trick! We use light cream cheese to cut back on calories a bit.

Excellent! We loved the basil & tomato in these. Only change was to use garlic powder in place of fresh because I didn't think the garlic would end up being cooked enough for our tastes - and I also baked them at 350 for 20 minutes, broiled for 2-3 minutes. Thanks :)

Great flavor, love this recipe! We love jalapenos and basil and never knew they go so well together. I only have sun-dried tomatoes in oil at my market, and they worked out fine. I've made these a few times now, the only changes I've made are as follows. I threw in a little Worcestershire sauce to the cheese mix for a bit more flavor. I sprinkled cheddar cheese over the filling before closing, it helps to keep the cream cheese from spilling out during cooking and who doesn't love more cheese? Oh, and if you don't have time to defrost bacon or just don't have any, I've successfully used "real" bacon bits from Hormel.

Wow!  These are the most delicious stuffed jalapenos I've ever tasted.  I was so curious about the cream cheese and the other ingredients...different from the usual cheese.  I used the sunflower oil packed, but didn't realize it at the time that I bought it.  I really squeezed the oil out with a paper towel as much as possible.  I oven roasted them and I am definitely sharing this recipe. Very,very tasty!!

This is a great recipe, made them in the oven and everyone thought they were very tasty.  One lesson wear gloves when preparing as your hands can get burned when taking out the seeds. I will be making these for the superbowl!!

I've been making these crowd pleasers for years and I'm back at 'em again for the neighbor's Cinco de Mayo party. I add about a 1/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the filling to enhance the flavor. It also thickens the filling which keeps it from running down your arm when eating. The only problem is making enough to satisfy the crowd. They go fast!

Love these! I cut off the top of the jalapenos and core  out all the seeds with a potato peeler. I also mixed in fresh grated parmasan cheese with some Worcestershire sauce and stuffed them with that. I also use metal skewers and an metal upside down cooling rack so they can hang up in the air and they arent sitting in their own grease.

Added a bit of garlic powder and hot chili powder to the cream cheese. Based on other reviews I used a whole slice of bacon per pepper half but I think that's overkill.

Please note: If you take nothing else from this review then take this. The filling can be made in advance and stored in the fridge. Then you can just pop a few on the grill anytime you gill out. All so the recipe does not say whether to grill direct or indirect. Direct worked like a charm. Now on to my thoughts of the recipe.   Major hit at my last tailgate party. I made them the night before, then threw them on one of the grills while other stuff cooked. They finished in plenty of time to serve as appetizers. Once word got out how good they were I had people for several other tailgates coming by for a few and ran out WAY early.

My dad's life changed the day I introduced these to his grilling repetoire.  Even basic cream cheese, without any additional ingeds. is tasty and irresistable.

I've made these a number of times following the recipe exactly.   I even made enough to freeze. They freeze great !  Take them right out of the freezer and put them in a 425 degree oven for about 20-25 minutes and they come out perfect !  I've both grilled and baked these (both from frozen and not frozen) and I actually prefer them baked.

While the filling was good, and the idea of them being bacon wrapped is good....I felt the peppers them self had no real taste.  I think I would like to try pickled jalapeno peppers rather then fresh peppers.

I think the jalapenos you get make a big difference on whether these turn out hot or not.  Seeds and membranes do make a difference too, but I don't know how you'd know if the peppers are hot or not without them.  These were tasty with peppers from my garden without the dried tomatoes--thanks for sharing!!

Really good recipe - I was a little clumsy on getting a lot of the seeds out of some of the peppers and found that half my batch were delicious, and half my batch were nuclear, brain-exploding hot - so be careful with getting the seeds out.

If you love stuffed jalepeno's and bacon, you'll love these. But be careful to get ALL the seeds out, even if you love spicy food, like me, a few jalepeno seads can bring you to tears.  We made these with turkey bacon, and they had a very "expensive" quility to them - unlike any other jalepeno popper I've ever had.   Personally, I thought they were a little too cream-cheesy, but they added an interesting dimension when chopped up and thrown in a chicken soft tacos.  For spicy-food lovers, the skins of the jalepeno's are not spicy on their own - you'll need to add some jazz to the stuffing.

This was a great recipe.  Instead of bacon (my husband doesn't care for it) I got sausage and took the casing off of it and browned it.  You can by ground sausage to make life eaiser.  But i got a already seasoned sausage with parsely and some cheese in it.  I also added extra salt/pepper to the sausage and chillies for spice.  I then put the cooked sasuage on a plate and pressed paper towels on it to drain any excess fat and then mixed it into the already made cream cheese filling (I followed the cream cheese filling as stated but added some extra pickled peppers/chilis to the mix and also a sprinkle of parmesean cheese).  Then scooped some and put it in each jalapeno.  As you can imagine my outcome was delicous but extremely hot!!!  :)  Next time i will cut down (just a little) on all those chilis!

This is one of our favorite recipes.  We started making them after they were on Emeril's Tailgating Contest on the Food Network and have been making them regularly since.  They're a lot of trouble, but very worth it!

Great recipe, wish I thought of it myself... Oh, I did.  Try searching for "Joe's Screaming Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers" on FoodNetwork.com.   Imitation is the best form of flattery... I guess?

Great recipe but if u do it according to the instructions it very hot!!! I modified it a bit. I chopped up the bacon and put it in the cream cheese mix instead of wrapping it in it and I cut them in half and I bake the jalapeños for 15 to 30 mins to get some of the fire out of them the I add the cream cheese filling and bake again for 30 min or so but I leave them open in half. Less heat more enjoyable.

These stuffers were excellent... I didn't have basil on hand but I did added a bit of cilantro instead to the mixture and it came out rather good.

Awesome - these are now my brother-in-laws favorite! We make them every time we grill.  We even make a few without the bacon for my vegetarian sister!

Poppers are one of our favorite appetizers, and these did not disappoint!  I downsized the recipe and used six jalapeños.  The cream cheese mixture was delicious in these, but next time I'm going to up the basil and sundried tomatoes, just a little bit.  I only used a half strip of bacon on each one and it was plenty to cover all the filling.  We started them on the grill, cheese side down, once the bacon was cooked we flipped them.  The reason we grill this way is when you start them the cheese mixture is still cold, so it is less likely to ooze out of the pepper.  Once the bacon is crisp, we flip and grill the other side and the now melted cheese filling stays in the pepper.  We had these along with grilled Romaine, 'Jalapeño Grilled Cheese Sandwich' and 'Greek Grilled Cheese' from AR.

Oh my goodness! These are sooooo spicy, I know why they call them "screaming" stuffed peppers!  Very spicy, but very delicious.

I loved these!  I made them just as written, except I halved the recipe.  The jalapenos that I used were huge, so I had to cook a little longer, as well.  I will definitely make again...soon!
