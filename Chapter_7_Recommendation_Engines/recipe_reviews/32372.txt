I used Fresh Pineapple Chunks instead of Pineapple juice... and left out the sherbet.  It was soooo yummy! I also added fresh cut up strawberries too.  Will definitely make again!

We just had a bridal shower for my daughter.  The punch was a "big" success.  Everyone said that it was delicious.  We had 21 guests and went through a double batch.  Very easy and very delicious!

I use this recipe for my 6th grade son's advisory/homeroom. It's great to take in and if the class isn't quite ready for it, that's ok because the ice cream needs to be on the soft side. It's so easy to do too. Just add it all to one big punch bowl!

Thanks for this recipe.  I needed something easy for a 50th wedding anniversary party and tried a few different recipes from this site.  This was definitely the easiest and went over great, even with using only half the amount of sherbet it called for.  I was expecting about 100 people and bought enough for five batches and used every drop!

I was in a rush and quickly tried to find an easy punch recipe for a party that I was attending that same day. I used others suggestions and brought the ingredients to the party (The hostess confirmed that she had a punch bowl) and through it together rather quickly. I also went on the suggestion of using champagne. We threw in a whole bottle and it tasted magnificent. I wasn't looking to "wow" anyone but this punch did just that! So easy and so many compliments! There were only about 20 people and it went really quickly since everyone went back for 3rds and 4ths! I will be using this recipe again and again. Thanks!

There is something about punch that just makes special occasions seem more...well, special! Served this for a bridal shower last weekend along with sodas. Everyone kept coming back for the punch and the soda was pretty much overlooked. Very good flavor! My daughter wants me to mix up more just for us to have at home!

This punch is so easy and it rocks.  My only complaint was the color was kind of blah, so I added some red food coloring, and that made all the difference. :)  I used natural fruit punch, which isn't bright red, so that was probably the issue.  The punch is really awesome, though.

I have been making this for years.  Everyone loves this.  I've made changes here and there delpending on what I have at hand or what's  on sale and found that you can add a can of frozen OJ to this.  You can also leave out the pineapple juice if you use the OJ it just isn'a as sweet  and If you don't have fruit punch tropical punch kool aid works just as well and for an adult party addind some wildberry schnapps or coconut rum is delicious.  This also makes great smoothies if you have any fresh or frozen fruit

while this recipe tasted delicious, it didn't look appetizing in the punch bowl & only got worse as the night went on. I would advise buying the brightest red fruit punch you can find.

I had this at a family function with my inlaws and you cannot believe how many times they request that I make this!  I simply use equal parts of bottled fruit punch and ginger-ale, although I'll have to try the pineapple.  I also make ice molds or cubs out of punch so it stays cold but doesn't get watered down.  I usually use raspberry sherbet but any kind will work!  Make sure the liquids are cold, cold, cold.

I threw a bridal shower for my daughter today. Everyone loved this punch. We had 52 guests and the punch bowl was filled a few times. I had the recipe displayed by the punch, and I was told by many of the guests how good it was. This recipe I'll use from now on for all my parties. It's a keeper.

This was a hit at our local library event! I used rainbow sherbet, and it had great flavor. Also made it with Cherry 7Up instead of ginger ale; gave it great carbonation but added additional flavor.

We made this on a rainy Sunday afternoon, scaled for just the two of us.  I didn't have any sherbet, so I ran to the convenience store and bought an orange Push-up, then plunked it in the drink.  Very refreshing!

I made this for my daughters graduation party last year and will be using for my son's graduation this year.  It tasted so good and went quickly so keep plenty left to refill the punch bowl.  Had at least 50 people ask for the recipe.

Love this punch!! Made it as recipe states and also made by adding 1/2 gal of OJ. Can't get enough of it when I make it for a party - I think I actually look forward to that more than the food!

This tastes great but looks aweful!  Everyone seemed to love the punch but it started to turn more and more brown looking.  Maybe next time I will try food coloring to brighten it up a bit.

Great punch for all ages. I served this for a baby shower and everyone was drinking it, even though we had a variety of drinks.

Easy & yummy!! I bought cheap, copy ginger-ale and cheap punch soda for extra fizz, store brand pineapple juice, and rainbow sherbet because it was the only one in gallon size!  Teens at the dance I was serving for loved it and so did I!

Excellent recipe, it was a hit. the only thing is that if the kids are not used to drink sodas, they won't like it. for my next party i will make half recipe with Ginger ale and the other without any soda, but the flavor is really good. Some of my friends wanted to try it with vodka ((^,^)) but that will be for a different party.

I used rainbow sherbet and it got rave reviews. I tried to soften the sherbet by putting it in the fridge for like 18 hours before i served the punch this made it easier to serve but not quite as many ice cream chunks as i wanted so maybe less time...

This punch is always a hit at parties where it is served. The pictures shows the rainbow sherbet - which is totally fine to use - but the guests typically enjoy the orange sherbet much better.

Maybe for a child's party this recipe is ok.  But, I made it for a work event, celebrating a work anniversary, and I was embarrassed that I served it.  I think it would fair much better at a child's event.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use this at a Garden Club meeting.  It was so easy and everyone loved it.  I got more comments than I would have imagined.  The only change I made was to use Rainbow sherbet that someone else suggested.  Great recipe.

This was a HUGE hit at my daughter's first birthday party! My guests didn't even touch the soda in the coolers and they happily downed the entire punch recipe. I have the same punch bowl that is in the photo, and I found that it only fit half of the recipe at a time - be sure to either know your punch bowl's capacity or go half to begin with (you can always add more later). Good thing I eye balled it before combining! Wonderful recipe, wouldn't change a thing. Five stars!

I made this punch for Halloween 2012.  Everybody loved it!  I put the chilled pineapple juice with some Hawaian Punch Strawberry Lemonade in the blender, poured the mix in a bowl then added more of the Hawaian Punch and the scoops of the Orange Sherbet.  At the end added the Ginger Ale. Exactly how the recipe shows.  Since it was for Halloween, I added monster eyeballs.  Got lychee, red cherries and raisins.  Put the cherries inside of the lychee, and the raisins inside of the cherries.  Everything looked and tasted great! The eyes didn't float though, will upload a picture as soon as I can.  Enjoy!

*PERFECT*
I made this last winter for the Grand Opening of my husband's new business and it was a hit with adults and children alike.  
I am making it again tonight for a party and recall how EASY it is to take the ingredients in their containers and make the punch there.  Last year I had to make four bowls full and easily kept the ice cream and juices cold between refills in their containers on the back porch in the snow!

(LATER)
Making this yet again for a holiday party!  Might as well print a bunch of copies of the recipe right now; I always get asked for it!!

I made this fruit punch for Christmas and everyone loved the taste.  I agree with one of the reviewers that the color is a bit dull, but other than that it was a hit.  I will make this again and maybe just add food coloring and see if that helps with the color.

I didn't think the gingerale/Hawaiian punch is enough of a kick for real punch. It was too sweet and the sherbet got lost.

I brought this punch to Thanksgiving with 15 of us. The non alcoholic drinkers appreciated the extra option instead of wine or water.  I also used some frozen fruit that we floated on top to keep it cold.  Almost all of it was consumed and there were a lot of compliments. ALSO, I used v8 berry splash instead of fruit punch and it was delicious! I would make this again for a party.

Delicious and so easy! I have made this many times and everyone really enjoys it. I use Hawaiian Punch, store brand ginger ale and Dole pineapple juice. Most recently I could not find plain orange sherbet and ended up using orange cream sherbet from Edy’s and it worked out well with that too. It was very pretty. For people who said it didn’t look too appetizing I think you may want to avoid rainbow sherbet to avoid a gray mix in the end and use a bright red fruit punch like Hawaiian Punch. Also as stated in the recipe make sure to stir in the sherbet and let it melt a little for good flavor.

This punch is so good! I made it for a university honor society function. I used Simply brand Fruit Punch, Canada Dry Ginger Ale with Lemonade, Langer's 100% Pineapple Juice, and Great Value Orange Sherbet. It was a big hit! I highly recommend it!

Based on other comments I replaced the pineapple juice with cut pineapple. My one-gallon jar didn’t have room for the sherbet, so I left it out. It was a crowd pleaser and disappeared quickly.

The great thing about this recipe is you can make it in a variety of ways. I used the bottled pineapple/mango/guava combo, a bottle of Hawaiian Punch and instead of using Ginger Ale, I used  a bottle of sparkling apple cider (found in the juice isle) as the bubbly. It was awesome! If you're entertaining adults, champagne works well too!

This was super sweet!  I used V8 Splash Fruit Medley for the fruit punch thinking Hawaiian Punch would make it too sweet.  The kids liked it, but there was leftovers.  I've made the rainbow sherbert 7-Up punch before and we really like that.  But this was just too sweet for us.

Great for the all-school parent-child reception after the grade school commencement ceremony. I served it in the same kind of glass beverage server, didn't bother with any fruit chunks (don't need little hands in the punch!) but it comes out a pretty color and super, super easy. The sherbert is a great way to keep it cold without watering it down while we were all in the ceremony.

Made this for a piano recital - it was really easy to take all the (pre-chilled) ingredients and pour them into the container on site.  The only "trouble" was scooping the sherbet in, and that was really easy.  It was all gone before we left.

Made this for a kid's birthday party.  It was a big hit for young and old alike.  I used an actual Fruit Punch (not Hawaiian Punch)which was darker in color so it wasn't red looking like the photo, but it was delicious.  Not a drop was left at the end of the party.
