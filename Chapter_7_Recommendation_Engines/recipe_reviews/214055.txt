OK, this is a good base but very bland in terms of flavor. My modifications happened as I kept adding things to get an actual flavor. I put in a bit of lemon juice, just because of avocado turning grey paranoia. Added 1 tbsp of horseradish, 1 tsp of real Dijon mustard, 1/8 tsp cayenne. To me "deviled" eggs need a bit of a kick. The texture of this is wonderful. And I think the color is kind of fun.

My son hates mayo, so I thought that he would like these deviled egg.  I was right!  These are a big hit.  Very creamy.  I can not really taste the avacado.

4 stars for the idea, but I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  Mine turned out pretty good, but be careful how much sour cream you add because too much will ruin the flavor.  I also added a little lemon juice and instead of Worcestershire, since I had none, I used a mixture of salt, pepper, onion & garlic powder, paprika, and a little chili powder.  I think they would've been perfect if I hadn't used too much sour cream.

I was so intrigued by this recipe using avacado to lighten up a not so healthy addiction, deviled eggs!  I really liked the concept of this recipe, but I think this recipe is more of a base and needs some bumped up flavors added, hence the 3 stars.  But as a base recipe, it can easily have added ingredients to fit your tastes to make it a 4 or 5 star.  I added dashes of hot sauce, dijon mustard, sugar, onion and garlic powders, cayenne, and some sweet paprika.  It's also great along with garnishing with green onion on top, to add some bacon and cheddar cheese!  Thanks for this great idea!  I will make again when wanting a lightened up version of deviled eggs.

I love the avocado and dill combination!  Without sour cream, I used mayonnaise this time.  Green onions or chives would have made a nice garnish, but I emphasized the dill, and sprinkled dill seed on top!  These were a hit for my family!

Hubby wanted deviled eggs today but he had used up all the mayo so these sounded like a good idea.  They are good but not great.  I guess we like our deviled eggs with a bit of a kick, I normally add sriracha sauce to my eggs and they are a big hit...I could cut the dill and add sriracha.

Very Nice.  Used Dill paste, seasoned with garlic salt, onion powder, and dijon mustard to taste.  The avocado has a great texture to it. What I didn't stuff into the egg whites my daughter put on a Ritz and ate.

This recipe truly intrigued me.  I am always looking for new recipes to try that are low in fat and are GERD friendly.  I generally love deviled eggs, I have tried a variety of recipes, and since I also love avocados I thought that this would be a good choice.  I personally didn't like them. But, I found others either loved them or hated them.  I found them too bland, so I did add some prepared mustard, and a little fat-free mayo for a little bit of tang.  Scallion or chive pieces do help with the flavor.  You may like them, but I won't be making these again.

These are pretty bland.  Mustard or hot sauce would be an excellent addition, I think.

I loved these. The only things I buy mayo for is these, burgers and balogna sandwiches. I am trying to cut mayo out and making deviled eggs like this was awesome. I only used 3 eggs, half of a large alvo, added some freeze dried cilantro along with the other spices, my dill was dried as well, and I also used about 2 tbs of sour cream. The sc did not dilute the taste, they were great! I have some left over filling that I plan to use in a lettuce wrap tomorrow. Oh, I also added a splash of lemon juice to prevent browning. :) thanks!!!
