I thought this was going to be a very spicy because it was so dark, but I used Gala apples and this was a spectacular pie! The Gala apples really bring through the apple flavor.

I tried this recipe but 12 apples were way too many.  I wound up with enough filling for 2 deep dish pies piled almost 6 inches high, but it wasn't nearly sweet or spicy enough.  I may try again using only 6 apples, but I'll probably just stick to a tried and true recipe.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe. It is the perfect size for a good ole deep dish pie. WAY too much clove! It tasted like there should be a ham in the middle. I adjusted the spices to my own liking; 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp clove, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. and it tasted like the pie my husbands grandmother has made for 60 years. Unfortunately, hers just comes out of her hands, she's never measured but this is basically her simple recipe.

This was a great one. I thought there would be too much cloves spice (not my favorite) but the taste was excellent. Thanks for sharing
