What a great recipe -  The meat fell apart it was so tender and the gravy was delicious. I doubled the recipe for mushroom soup - 2 cans and 1 cup water (Not onion soup mix)and added a stalk of chopped celery and sliced fresh mushrooms.Also instead of water you can add 1 can of LOW Sodium beef broth. Cooked it on high for 5 hours, adding the carrots(small bag of baby carrots) and potatoes for the last 2 hours. I made fresh bread to suck up the gravy. YUMMY!!!.Thank you for sharing this recipe Katy. I just want to add that I smushed my potatoes before taking the photo - I was so hungry from the smell I almost forgot to take the photo.

I have made a basic recipe of beef, onion soup mix, and cream of mushroom soup for years.  NEVER THOUGHT of adding the potatoes and carrots......THIS BROUGHT THE DISH TO LIFE!!!!  A small suggestion for those that prefer a more "beefy" version of the gravy is to add a package of beef gravy along with a cup of water.

Really Good!! I browned the meat first and deglazed the pan with 1C water. I added that water to the soup mixes, cut the onion into quarters and I could have added more of them (but I had read that others thought the onion flavor was too much) I also added and a few stalks of celery cooked it on high for 6 hrs and it was perfectly done. I will make this again the family loved it and there were no leftovers.

The potatoes got mushy from being in the slow cooker all day and it turned into more of a stew.  I think next time I'll add the veggies later on.  But the steaks were very tender.

This was really good!! It only needs a small amount of water, maybe 1/4 cup, to keep the gravy from being too watered down.

I browned the meat first and added some spices for flavor...however, after cooking on low for 8 hours it still came out pretty tasteless and the meat was tough. Also, the potatoes were still hard after the 8 hours. I don't know what I did wrong!

this would be a 5 star but for one error on recipe.  Don't put potatoes and carrots in until  the last 3-4 hours.  I use the dry beefy onion soup mix when I make this.  If I don't have that, I use regular dry onion with beef broth instead of water.  I sear the beef before starting in a bit of garlic oil.  Not required but keeps the beef flavor full.  I also put a dash of worchestershire sauce in.  This also works with a pot roast (chuck).  Just add an extra can of mushroom soup. If you like your vegetables a bit more al dente, steam them to desired and ad to pot and serve.  If you like wine in your sauces then use red like merlot instead of water.

I did not like this at all.  For some reason this was quite bland.  My husband liked it though.  I won't be making this again.

I've made this recipe for 20 yrs +/-. 
I don't put in onion with the onion soup mix.
Use 2 or 3 beef boullion cubes for added flavor.
No crockpot; just put in a dutch oven in the oven & cook 3- 4 hrs @ 325.

Been making this for years.  Started using a rump roast and discovered it can be used with about any beef.  When I use round steak I call it Smothered Steak.  Instead of water I use 7Up, Sprite, Tonic, Club Soda or even beer.  The carbonation will tenderize the meat even more.  I add fresh mushrooms about 2 hrs before cooking is complete.

I made a few of my own adjustments, but overall this recipe was a good start :) I added one can of beef broth to the soup mixture, and about 1/2 cup of red wine. Also, I rubbed chopped garlic cloves and olive oil all over the meat before searing and sprinkled with basil and black pepper. I used about 1/2 bag of baby carrots, 6 small potatoes, and a sweet onion.. it came out great! I only had about 1 lb of round steak so it only took about 3.5 hours on high and it was good to go. Next time I will get a larger cut of meat and let it simmer all day, then add the veggies in later.

The flavor of this dish was okay, but definitely add the vegs in the last 2-3 hours of cooking. I followed the recipe (but browned the meat first) and the veggies turned into a mushy mess at the bottom of the slow cooker. I think my slow cooker was also a little too big- the liquid didn't cover the meat and I think that made it a little tough.

Pretty good, but kind of bland the first time I made it.  The second time, I used beef broth instead of water, and seasoned the meat with garlic pepper, seasoned salt and onion powder.  We though it was much better with the modifications.  This is one of my husband's favorites.

Very tasty and easy dish to prepare.  The only variation I made was to add the onion, carrots, and potatoes half way through the cooking process.  I prefer my vegetables to be tender but not mushy and I find that with slow cooking, if they are added at the start, mushy is often what you get. Other than that...it was fantastic!

My whole family loved this simple recipe.  I used beef broth in place of the water.  The gravy was a little thin so I thickened it with some instant potato flakes.  Thanks for the recipe--it's a keeper!

This reminded me of my favorite pot roast recipe. It was delicious! I used 1 lb. of round steak, 3 carrots, 4 medium gold potatoes, half a packet of onion soup mix, a can of mushroom soup and a can of low sodium beef broth. I let this cook for 7 hours in my small crock pot, adding a small can of drained, sliced mushrooms for the last 90 minutes. Delicious comfort food, great for a fall day dinner!

Oh my goodness this was good!  My husband was raving and asking me when I could make it again immediately.  I used the 98% ff cream of mushroom soup to lighten it up a bit.  I also used more carrots than the recipe asked for - almost a full bag of baby carrots.  The carrots were especially good I thought!

The only thing I do different is substitute the potatoes with celery, only because I do not like the way potatoes cook in a crockpot. Otherwise this is a very good crockpot meal. The meat is nice and tender, not to mention the heavenly aroma. I serve mine with mashed potatoes.

We cut up round steak and add to the crock pot.  Mix 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 soup can milk and homemade onion soup mix (from this site).  Pour over un-cooked meat and cook on low for the entire time we are at work.  I steam the potatoes and carrots separately so they are not mushy.  Mix and enjoy.  The gravy is to die for.

Quick and very easy with lots of GREAT flavor! Very easy on the wallet as well...Because I doubled this recipe and only had 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup, I used a can of Golden Mushroom as well. The kids loved it! Even though the taters and carrots were excellent, I could see leaving the veggies out and putting the meat and sauce over egg noodles as well.

3/3/09~I first reviewed this in '04, and I'm still making this with just a few revisions.  I substitute cream of celery soup,  and add a couple of tablespoons  of "Kitchen Bouquet"...Browning & Seasoning Sauce...my mainstay for adding extra beefy flavor [especially to gravies]. I mix it with the soups before adding to crock pot.  I've used round steak, and sirloin steak and arm roast...but I would not use the roast again...it just wasn't the same.  ALWAYS put the veggies on the bottom. I quarter the potatoes and use baby carrots. I've never browned the meat first and don't think in this case it is necessary at all.  This recipe is a KEEPER! Below is what I wrote in '04. Terrific!  I added more potatoes and a bag of frozen carrot slices that I put in a colander and ran water over them to soften them up a little. Also, I added a little beef soup base for flavor.  I used tenderized round steak.  MELTS in your mouth!  Due to time restraints, I cooked it 5 hours on high...came out wonderful!

This was so easy yet absolutely delicious, I did flour and browned the meat also, deglazing the pan with 1/4 cup water, but followed the recipe after that. My family loved it and the next day it was even better. Definitely a keeper!!!

I have used london broil in place of the round steak before and always season with garlic salt and pepper before browning the meat.  I like to use golden mushroom soup in place of the white mushroom soup. This is a very tasty dinner.

If you cut the meat into bite size pieces, this recipe is stew.  I'm taking off one star because keeping the round steak in larger chunks just doesn't allow the meat to get as tender as it would if it cut smaller no matter how long you cook it.  I put the meat in very early in the morning with the liquid mixture.  I substituted beef broth for the water and added 1/4 cup red wine and some minced garlic.  About 6 hours before dinner time I added the potatoes and carrots and about 30 minutes before I added some chopped mushrooms.  I also thickened the gravy a bit with some water/cornstarch before serving.  The result was pretty good although it is so much like stew that you might as well just cut everything up smaller and call it stew!

I did this with a 2 lb bottom round roast.  I seasoned with garlic powder, natures seasoning & a little salt, seared in pan on all sides before placing in slow cooker. I did add cut & peeled gold potatoes & a bag of baby carrots.  1 can cream of mushroom (healthy one) & 1 can a beef broth.  I did try the beefy onion soup mix too.  Cooked about 6-7 hours on low (although I think my slow cooker cooks quite hot) It was excellent.  Great fall/winter meal!!

Pretty good! Tastes like the usual pot roast/potatoes/carrots I make, so it wasn't stand out or anything. We enjoyed it though. I used Vidalia onions and baby carrots, then added 3 more potatoes to it. I don't bother peeling the potatoes- just gave them a good wash. Mine were thin skinned white potatoes.

The recipes name serves it right! Very Tender! Very Yummy! I changed the recipe a little (didn't add carrots and did add a packet of brown gravy based on another reviewer), but the base recipe is good! I cooked this for 8 hours, and loved it! The meat fell apart so it ended up being more like stew, but still great (just not a pretty presentation). Thanks! I will definitely make it again!

Turned out wonderfully. Used beef broth, as suggested, and cooked for 4 1/2 hours on low for 1 lb. Waited until the last 2 hours to add the potatoes (didn't use carrots) and a small can of mushrooms. Beef was fall-apart tender. Great quick and easy recipe for a cheap cut of meat.

Excellent!  I too added some chopped celery (I had some that needed using up)and Beef Onion Soup mix.  Added 1/4 t ground black pepper and WOW it was so yummy after about 8 hours.  As one reviewer noted the gravy was watery, so I thickened at the end with flour - about an hour before done.

I want to point out that almost every crock pot recipe on here has someone stating it didn't get cooked in the time given.  Not all crock pots are created equal, and high altitude (where I cook) makes the time somewhat longer. I compensate for it by setting it on high for the first hour and then turn down.  I can do this while getting ready for work, then turn down when I leave.

I make this often but with 2 changes. I only add about 1/4 cup of water, and I use Golden Mushroom soup instead of the regular for better color and flavor.

This is such a good base recipe!  I rate it 5 stars just for that...however, I also added a few dashes of worsechister (?), I dredged the round steak in flour and browned in a frying pan and then deglazed the pan with some inexpensive merlot and then added that to the crock pot.   I did not add the potatoes, carrots, or onions.  I did serve it with a delicious scalloped potato and green beans!

Made it according to the recipe.  I wonder if results vary with the brand name of the onion soup mix?  Mine wasn't salty enough (and we are no-added-salt people).  I slow-cooked it on low for 8 hours but the meat wasn't as tender as it might have been.  The "gravy" was thin:, not bad but less water or some flour to thicken it might have helped.  

Lastly, the color turns out pretty bland.  I served with sliced peppers, green, red and yellow, that improved the presentation.  My wife loved it.

Should recipes that depend on pre-made ingredients (like the onion soup mix) include brand names?

This is an excellent and simple recipe, and I've done something very similar with all roasts that I make.  The only difference in my recipe is that I use a 3.5 to 4 pound boneless chuck roast and I substitute a can of beef broth for the cream of mushroom soup because of a food allergy.  It's also a good idea to add a couple of tablespoons of worcestershire sauce for added flavor.  If you substitute the beef broth for cream of mushroom soup, you'll need to add about a tablespoon of corn starch at the end of cooking to thicken the gravy.

Omigosh! This is the BEST Pot Roast I've ever tasted! Round steak was on a buy-one get-one special this week, so I made it twice. 

I omitted the vegetables (fussy kids) and after I removed the meat, I strained the liquid and discarded all the onion soup bits. There was minimal fat, which I tried to chill and remove; the resulting gravy and meat were incredible with mashed potatoes.

Thank you for this recipe. You don't KNOW how many bad versions I've made, using Lipton Onion Soup mix, before this one came along!

p.s. It really does need a full ten hours. It's worth it!

Great recipe! It's easy to throw together, creamy and has a good mix of veggies. I used about six red potatoes and about 24 baby carrots. Just be careful not to dry out the meat if you're using a crock pot instead of a slow cooker- mine was boiling and done after about six hours. Thanks for the great recipe!

The was a nice, easy recipe! Since I was in a hurry I decided to cook it on high for 3 1/2 hours. It turned out pretty good, but the meat would have probably been more tender if I had cooked on low according to the directions, which I will do next time. The best part of this recipe was the gravy, that was delicious over the potatoes!

My wife said this is her favorite slow cooker dish yet! I added 15-18 whole button mushrooms to the vegies. The steak turned out to be very tender. I also added 1/2c red cooking wine in the last 10 minutes for some added flavor.  We'll definitely make this over and over again.

I think this could definitely be better. I agree with alot of others, it's bland and I think the reason was too much water. I had to salt the heck out of it. The gravy was runny also. I have made other slow cooker recipes using cream of mushroom and soup mix and they have come out much better, making a wonderful gravy. Sot it wasn't BAD, just not impressive.

I listened to some of the other reviews about it being bland. With that in mind, I added some seasoning to the steak and used roasted garlic cream of mushroom instead of the plain cream of mushroom soup. I am not crazy over onions although I like the flavor so I left out the onion and just added the onion soup mix. I also used baby carrots and left a little skin on the potatoes. The steak turned out wonderful! It was not bland at all! Thanks for sharing this receipe!

Pretty good flavor however I followed the recipe and then instead of mushroom soup combined the dry onion soup with a large can of crushed tomatoes in puree. My personal favorite is Redpack tomatoes. I also crushed and then coarsely chopped 5 cloves of garlic and added basil and thyme. 30 min before end of cooking I added 1/2 cup of red wine. Overall it reduces the sodium content and using bottom round steaks allows for some savings with great flavor. My husband could not get enough! Hope this is useful.

I lightly browned the steak with a few tablespoons of water and used the broth to make a "test" gravy with the C of M soup and the dry soup. I did find it rather bland and substituted an Italian dressing mix for the onion soup mix. I also used apples instead of carrots and that turned out really well, though I might add them 2/3 of the way through cooking the next time.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe a lot. The meat was very favorful and soft. The juice came out to be very watery. Maybe adding some corn starch  to thicken up the juice before serving next time. Will definitely make it again. Thank you!

This was really good and the meat was so tender.  I added a can of mushrooms just because I like them.  Be sure to use low sodium soup or it will turn out salty.  Next time I will add the carrots and potatoes half way through cooking time because they were too mushy for us.

This is an easy recipe, but the meat, although very tender, was extremely dry. The vegetables turned out well. I won't be doing this one again.

Quick, easy & tasty! I didn't cut the meat or use onions. I also used a partial bag of baby carrots. It made a great, thick gravy, and if the meat were cut, I could see how it would be like a beef stew. For us though it was more like a thin roast with veggies and gravy. Definitely a keeper!

This was VERY tender, I loved it! I only cooked it for 7 hours and it came out great. If you like pot roast you will like this, and using a round steak is much cheaper than a whole roast.

This recipe does wonders to inexpensive cuts of meat such beef round bottom round steaks (got mine from Sams club). I did run about 1.5 hours short on time so here is what I did. I placed baby carrots & yellow onions on bottom, cut steaks into 4in by 4in pieces and layered on top of veggies. Used beef broth, soup mix & mushroom soup on top and set on high for 1.5 hours then changed to low setting for another 5 hours. Added sliced raw mushrooms in last 40 minutes. My carrot did not turn out mushy as others said.  Steak, to my surprise, was tender enough to shred by fork and had great flavor! Even my 3 year old loved it and he doesn't eat much meat. I served with mashed potatoes & french bread yummy!  Also, you can make thicker gravy out of the crock pot sauce.. was overall VERY good dish for not a lot of work or money =) I'm writing this review as I'm eating the leftovers for lunch the next day, just as good!

Love slow cooker recipes - this one was simple and delicious - which I also love. I have a large family and a large slow cooker, so have to be careful to add enough liquid to cover meat. This steak cooked up tender but I may try to cut sodium level next time.

This was soooo good!  I seasoned my meat the night before and left it in the refridgerator.  I like a thicker sauce so the next day (one hour before the meal was finished) I added some cornstarch to water and poured it in my crockpot.  It made a nice gravy.  I will definately be making this in the future.

I make something very similar to this but with a few changes. I don't add an onion to this because you are already getting the flavor from the dry soup mix. I also use beef broth instead of mushroom soup and water (taste preference). Adding some worcestershire sause into the mix helps with the flavoring, and I like to add frozen peas at the end, that way they don't get too mushy. This is a great dish that can be made without a special trip to the grocery store using stuff you are more than likely to have at home already and is very easy and delicious

This is definitely tender!  Like other reviewers, I tweaked it a bit to enhance the flavor.  I added a packet of brown gravy mix and increased the water to total one cup.  Also added sliced celery and liberally sprinkled a salt free all purpose seasoning that includes parsley, basil, red pepper & thyme over the meat before adding the liquid/soups.

The first time I made this exactly as written and it was just a little bland - but GOOD, don't get me wrong. The second time I used GOLDEN MUSHROOM soup instead of Cream of Mushroom and it really kicked it up a notch. Fantastic recipe!

This is how I have made pot roast for years, except I use beef broth instead of water, and I do occasionally add beef gravy to the mix.  So good!  And then, use the leftovers for soup--even better!!

This was simple and had a great flavor. The meat came out very tender. Only changes I made were sprinkling garlic salt over the meat before cooking and including sliced fresh mushrooms.

The taste on this recipe is fantastic, but despite 7 hours in the slow cooker, the meat was still a little tough. 

I expected this to tenderize the meat more than it did, so I didn't do anything to tenderize the meat beforehand. 

Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will just prepare the meat a little more beforehand.

This was good comfort food but fell a little flat.  I added some Worcestershire and my son was still looking for something to give it more flavor.  Next time, I might try adding some wine and/or some more herbs.  It seemed much like stew and I like to add a bay leaf or two to stew so maybe I was missing that.  The meat was very tender and I like to use red potatoes as they don't get mushy in the crock pot.  I never think baby carrots give as much flavor as whole carrots that have been cut. Overall good, but not a knock out dish and that is what I collect for my keeper recipes.

My family really enjoyed this.  I forgot to cut the meat into chunks and it still turned out perfect.  Works for any kind of 'roast' for the crock pot.

I make this often, but instead of peeling and chopping carrots, I just pour a small bag of baby carrots in. It saves a lot of time.

This tasted like beef stew to me. The beef was indeed very tender, but I was expecting more flavor. The veggies got mushy too, but I wanted to make this recipe in the crock pot while I was at work, so I didn't follow some of the suggestions to add the veggies late in the cooking. I recommend following those suggestions to keep your veggies from falling apart.

Exactly that- yummy!  I used a top roast, which I had bought on sale,(thinking it was like a pot roast, which is "bottom" I learned,) and was happy to find this recipe that called for top or bottom!  I added celery and fresh mushrooms and substituted sweet for the white potatos, my husband's preference.  How fun to put it in the crock pot at 7am then come home to a cooked dinner at 5pm!  Just ate some leftovers for lunch- yum!

My husband and I liked this receipe only adding the extra onion was an overkill.  I added 1/2lb of fresh mushrooms and 1/4 t. fresh ground pepper.  It gave it a little more flavor

An almost perfect recipe! The modifications that I did and recommend is adding an extra can of cream of mushroom, replacing the water with a can of beef broth, and tossing in a few chopped celery stocks. I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce, 2 minced cloves of garlic, and black pepper to the sauce for extra flavor.

I cooked it on low for 6 hours and then took the meat out and shredded it (It was really tender!) before stirring it back in.

I made a side a rice that did an amazing job with absorbing the excess broth from the stew.

After reading comments that the veggies got too mushy I did a change up. I used potato halves instead of quarters and quartered a medium onion and placed on the bottom. Then placed meat on top. Then a bag of baby carrots on top of the meat. Then poured the soup mixture.in  Turned out great and no mushy veggies.

This was a good recipe for round steak.  I added mushrooms to this and the only thing I will do differently next time I make it is add a little more seasoning to it.  Onion powder, garlic powder, maybe even a dash of steak sauce to give it a little tang.  But I will keep this recipe in my slow cooker list for sure.

Turned out great! I changed the soup to Golden Mushroom instead of cream of mushroom, and increased water to 10oz (1 soup can.) I Lso cut the meat into stew size pieces, to speed up cooking process.

Really liked the recipe. I did cut the water back a bit after reading some reviews.  I did not put the potatoes in as I planned to make mashed potatoes on the side.

This recipe was AMAZING! I added some minced garlic and pepper and I used beef bouillon instead of water. My kids do not like to eat beef of any kind and they gobbled this up. I love crock pot recipes that are quick and easy too! :)

This was a really great recipe,and I am a pretty picky girl.  I was shocked that it turned out so great. The meat was tender and soft. This recipe was easy too, and since I am learning to cook i'm glad.

Excellent!  I had 2 one pound pieces of round steak.  I followed the directions, except I only had beefy onion soup.  I sprinkled some of the soup mix between the two pieces and stacked them.  After it had cooked about 6 hours, I added another can of soup and the potatoes and carrots.  After it cooked another 3-4 hours, I let it cool so I could slice the meat.  I added some beef bouillon crystals, then thickened the juices with corn starch and this made the most incredible tasting gravy.  We had open faced beef sandwiches (on toast) and it was delicious.  I was surprised at how tender and tasty the round steak was.  Definitely a keeper!

The steak is certainly tender.  I made exactly as recipe called for and family liked it.  For my family I'll need to spice it up just a bit to get them to LOVE it.  Still, this is a great basic recipe.

Easy and filling meal to make, but I'm just not real crazy about the flavors enough to probably make it again.  If I do, I'll tweak with the recipe a bit, maybe less onion.

I really wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  It's not bad; I just didn't like the taste of the meat and sauce.  If I were to make this again, I would use meat tenderizer on the round steak first, because the meat was still a little tough.

This was very thick and yummy.  I didn't need to thicken it up at all, and I added more water than was called for.  It just cooked all day and made the house smell great.  I served this over egg noodles, both my hubby and two year old loved it.

Very good taste.  I set my slow cooker to cook on low 8 hours then switch to warm, and it was a little dry.  I may try doubling the sauce next time.  The potatoes and carrots were a little over cooked, but I can't put them in late when I'm at work all day.  The taste was still good.  I may try cutting them a little larger next time.

This was a great hearty meal that was quick and easy to throw together.  The only changes I made was that I used cream of mushroom and garlic soup (as another reviewer suggested) and threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms.  I was careful not to overcook so that the potatoes would not turn to mush - and it was done cooking on low in about 5.5 hrs. I thought it turned out great and hubby agrees :)

This recipes was excellent. I browned my meat before added it to the crockpot and then deglased the pan with 1 cup of water. It takes longer to prepare but the taste is worth it. I added my potatoes and carrots in the lasts 2 hours of cooking so they wouldn`t go mush. My husband loved it. It was even better the next day. I`ll be making this often!

Thought this recipe was great!  I prepared it in the crock pot the night before and turned it on before I left for work.  It turned out great.  I did not cut up the potatoes and they were not mushy.  I also used the cream of mushroom with garlic soup.  My family loved it.  Will continue to make this for years to come.

I have now been using this recipe for over a year and each time I get great results.  I add parsley, beef oxo, bay leaf and some vermouth (instead of all the water, it helps tenderize the meat).  I have made this for company and family and all have enjoyed it.

My family and I thought this was very good.  It was very simple to make,  great for us with busy schedules.  I used beefy onion soup mix and added about one cup of water.

Absoltuley the best.  I would give this 6 stars if I could.  Like others I made just a few modifications:
1)  Used Celery instead of potatoes (made mashed instead)
2) Seared the meat in olive and garlic

Make sure that you make gravy with the liquid. The meat is so tender and moist you can cut it with a fork.
I used Chuck Pot Roast and not round steak which tends to be dry.

Okay, so hubby and I weren't impressed by this recipe, but it wasn't bad either. We both felt like it was missing something, but we weren't quite sure what that was. I did add fresh mushrooms that I halved, and some minced garlic. I'll probably make this again if I have round steaks that need used up.

Really good, though the onion is overpowering. I think it would taste better with only the onion OR the onion soup mix, not both.

Very tender meat and delicious gravy. I cooked oh HIGH on my crock pot. It did cook 7 hrs and made the meat fall apart. It did not burn but next time I would add more liguid so I would have more of that delish gravy. This is the first time Ivfound a crock pot dinner not stewing in water! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as shown and it came out almost flavorless. Even though some are saying it was too salty, mine came out bland.  Won't make this again.

I have been making round steak this way for years and it is always great.  I like to add a few celery stalks, salt and pepper (to taste).  Instead of regular mushroom soup, I like to use GOLDEN MUCHROOM soup.

Absolutely love this recipe. I have been cooking it for some time now. I usually double the recipe as we really enjoy it. The only changes I make is when I double it, I only add about a cup and 1/4 of water. Excellant!

this is a great starting place and by gleaning from other reviews, i chose to seer the steak/roast on the stovetop, remove the roast and add the water (w/ a bit of beef boulion added)and the soup, heated through and put it all in the cooker. add the veggies later to keep the from becoming veggiemush.

Great recipe! I've made this a few times already and forgot to review. I love london broil on the grill, but in the winter or weather permitting, I have no idea what to do with it (broiling never seems to work for me). This recipe is perfect the way it is! Add ingredients (i.e. veg or potato)to your personal taste, or not. Either way, it's a wonderful recipe, Tastes a bit like beef stew. Thank you for the ooh's & aah's while serving!

This came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly.A working womans friend. I prepped everything the night before and started it before work. By the time I came home dinner was ready. I plan to freeze the leftovers. Great use of an inexpensive cut of meat, very,very tender!

This recipe was great when i fixed it for my family. It reminded me alot of a roast. It smells great while it is cooking and tastes even better!
I'll definitely be fixing this more often, especially with colder weather closing in.

i treid this and did like it i just think a better grade of meat makes this dish better  you can cook it the same with a lot of different meats it just seemed to me that the round steak got to dry will cook it at a low setting next time

Fairly good, but needs salt pepper and a little more spice.  DO NOT add more wate to this recipe.  The vegetables and meat mixed with the soups and water are enough liquid.  I didn't think so.  That could have been the reason it wasn't as tasty as I would have liked .  Overall a good working mom's meal.

This was fantastic!!  I've always loved round steak in the crock pot, but had never done the whole meal in it.  I added some sliced fresh mushrooms before I added the gravy, and it turned out great!  Will make this again.

I added a drained can of mushrooms and chopped celery. I used beef broth instead of the water. 

Next time I will cut my carrots, meat and potatoes a little smaller. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again.

Made this while travelling down to California for the winter in our RV. Was so simple and the only thing I altered was I only used about a half a package of the soup mix with beef broth. Cooked as directed and it was absolutely yummy. We’ll have again if the weather cools down. Yummy. Hubby loved it.

This is a great recipe.  Next time I will put the onions on bottom and then the meat, and then the potatoes and carrots and top off with the soup, etc mixture.  The meat was a little dry and I think it will stay moist if it is on the bottom.

This was okay.  We added extra veggies and liquid.  The flavor was fine, but the meat was still tough.

This is a versatile recipe. The onion soup mix and the mushroom soup make a great base for gravy. I added beef broth, rather than water. I also loaded up the crock pot with a pound of cut up carrots ---no potatoes. Instead, I dumped in some egg noodles and kale towards the end. I also had to add another can of soup, some red wine, and a little more broth. Boy, did it turn out delicious! It's a great dinner for an Autumn Sunday evening!

Convenient and easy recipe. I prepped the night before and threw everything in the morning before leaving to work. 10 hours later on low, it came out tender and juicy. Some extra things I added were 5 cloves of garlic on the bottom of the cooker and threw in corn at the end. I could not find onion soup mix so I used chicken instead. I also slightly seasoned the meat with salt and pepper the night before. I also could not fit everything in my cooker so I was able to use only 4 carrots and 1.5 potatoes. If I had the chance, I would have put in the veggies during the last few hours because they turned out softer than I would have liked. It did come out kind of soupy and watery instead of a gravy like texture, so next time, I would use 2 cans of mushroom soup and no water.

Everybody said it was delicious. I used cream of potato soup. Also turn crockpot on low 4 hrs then 2 hrs high. Done to perfection. I used about 3lbs of round steak cut in slices with 1 cup of water.

I used baby carrots and cooked everythink together for 8.5 hours on low. I wasn't tok impressed. I thought the meat was still tough and overall it didn't have too much flavour. The carrots and potatoes cooked well.

This recipe was the inspiration for our supper tonight. I made it in my electric pressure cooker more as a stew. It took about 40 minutes total including the time it took for the cooker to pressure up in the beginning and for thickening at the end. I mostly followed the ingredients with these exceptions: cut the meat into bite size (stew) pieces; browned it on my cooker's sauté setting after sautéing a half of a quartered onion; threw in one chopped stalk of celery; left out the potatoes; and in lieu of water I used half and half beef and chicken broth (only because I had a tad bit of both in my fridge and wanted to use it up before I opened something new). I put everything in my cooker and used the meat/stew program key and adjusted the time for 27 minutes on high pressure. When it beeped done, I did a quick pressure release and used the sauté function with corn starch+water to thicken the juices.  While thickening I threw in some frozen peas. I served it over rotini pasta and my family chowed it down.

Well, it's not quite finished cooking, but it seems great.  I agree with most that I did add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and I used Cream of Chicken soup because I do not like Cream of Mushroom.  I should have used beef/chicken broth instead of water but I was out of those.  A SIMPLE NICE WEEKDAY MEAL.

Left out the potatoes  and made mashed potatoes instead.  The steak was tender, the carrots and onions were yummy and the gravy was out of this world over the mashed potatoes--thanks, Katy for a super easy work night dinner!

This recipe is great just as it is written. I took a shortcut and didn't peel the potatoes. I was running late and had to cook it in only 4 to 4-1/2 hours on high in my slow cooker. I was concerned that the meat wouldn't be as tender as I hoped but it couldn't have been better! Next time I may add some fresh mushrooms during the last hour or so of cooking.

This was sooo good and so simple even someone like me who doesn't know how to cook can do it! Before I put my meat in the crock pot I poked holes in it with a fork and used UNSEASONED meat tenderizer (both sides). The juices flowed right into the meat and the veggies were nice and soft. My family loves it and now think I know what I'm doing :)

I didn't add the potatoes, onion or carrots and we absolutely loved this recipe.  I used the mushroom onion soup mix and just added a sprinkle of cayenne and parsley to give it a bit of color.  Served with instant garlic mashed potatoes.  Hubby said to write this one down ASAP.

I eat it first,  it was okay, it lacks flavor, I followed was it said.  It was easy to prepared, but I don't think I will make it anymore. I will try to "dress" up the leftovers with more spices. I gave 2 stars for the convenience of the slow cooker and having dinner ready when I got home. .

What a super easy, tasty meal! My whole family enjoyed this one! I didn't have a round steak, so I used a sirloin steak instead. I used baby carrots instead of cutting up larger carrots (this made it a lot easier to put together!) and I doubled the amount of potatoes. I was out of cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken...it tasted great! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

No surprises here. This was a good, basic, meat and veggie slow cooker dish.

This was a 5 star right when DH took it out of the slow cooker, but after warming up a couple of times, the meat becomes kind of dry and tough.  That is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  But a family of four would be able to eat the whole thing in one sitting...well worth making!  The only thing I changed was..I only added two chopped up carrots.  Otherwise make it exactly as written.

This recipe is excellent. The only thing I did different is that I didn't add the chopped onion. I figured the onion soup mix would be plenty, and for our taste it was.

An almost perfect meal during this busy holiday season.  I doubled the recipe.  Next time I will still double it but use just one package of onion soup mix as it was a bit salty.

I used Bison to make this and it was pretty good, though it seemed to be a bit salty.  Maybe it was the soup mix I used.  I used the "Food Club" brand because it has no MSG.  It was still pretty good and went together quickly.

I have made this several times often altering the portions sizes. I adapts well when cut in half or even doubled. I was even confident enough to make it for my hyper critical mother-she liked it.

Pretty tender and easy to make. I might spice it up the next time we try it as we are a spicy family :-). I made the mistake of adding too many carrots...we had some baby carrots I wanted to use up and not waste so I threw them all in and it had a very carroty taste but other than that it was good. Thanks so much Katy!

I actually did not cut up the meat.  It came out a little dry.  Maybe next time, if I make it, I will cut it up and make sure that it is covered with the juices.  Overall it was ok.

The meat was very tender but horribly dry.  

Besides the meat, all was OK, needed salt and too runny so I added an extra can of cream of Mushroom.  Won't make again or at least not with the meat on top.

Strong points for the ease of this recipe. I was able to put together my whole meal in the morning, then relax all day. I’ll make it again. I added some caramel color to enhance the visual just a tad. Served with a Caesar salad and sourdough baguette, it made a lovely Sunday dinner.

Really good.  I  did 2 cans of cream of mushroom and I can of cream of chicken and 1 quartered onion.  Added 1/3 can of chicken broth instead of water.   3 steaks and seasoned steaks with seasoned salt, pepper, minced garlic, and steak seasoning before adding to crock pot - put in 1/2 bag baby carrots and 5 peeled and chunked potatoes after 4 hours cooking and cooked for a total of 8 hours.  Came out great and sauce was wonderfully thick and rich.  Husband ate every bite.

I used baby cut carrots instead and mixed  baby potatoes. I always substitute in any roast, instead of water, apple juice or cider. I used Snapple Apple and Simply Apple juice, to show that any really works.

This recipe makes a wonderfully delicious meal but it was a little salty because of the onion soup mix. Still really very good.

I love this recipe! I didn't think round steak could taste this good. i followed the recipe pretty closely, but I didn't have an instant onion soup packet handy...so I used 1/4 cup dried minced onion, 1 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp salt and 1 beef boullion cube as a substitute instead. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and didn't add the veggies until later--I cooked the meat in my crockpot on low for 10 hours total, adding the veggies when I only had 3 1/2 hours left of cook time. Super glad I did, as the vegetables were still super soft and almost mushy by then. The gravy was a little bit runny after cooking, so at the end of the 10 hours I removed the meat and veggies from the crockpot onto a serving dish, then whisked in some tapioca starch (I'm sure cornstarch or flour would work fine as well) into the sauce so that the gravy would thicken up a bit. The meat was super tender, and the husband approved as well. It's a winner!

I tried this out and it was good. The meat didnt get as tender as I thought it would. The potatoes and carrots stayed firm. I added fresh mushrooms and that gave it a good taste. Next time I will season my meat and cook it a little longer. Hopefully the vegs wont get mushy.

Really good. I added a little Montreal steak seasoning to individual servings. Might add fresh mushrooms next time. Good as is, though.

Easy and the meat was so tender!  Did  marinate the meat in Mojo Marinate for 1/2 hr. Will use less water next time 1/4 cup will be sufficient.

I made this today following the recipe as it is except I did do as one person commented and I skipped the onion soup mix, used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and beef broth in place of water as I had 3 pounds of meat. I also added 2 stalks celery and 4 chopped garlic cloves to the soup mixture. I used a liner bag in the crock pot and layered as directed. It only cooked about 4 1/2 hours and everything was done so I set my pot on warm as dinner was 2 hours away. This was absolutely fabulous! The meat was so tender no knife was needed. I was concerned that my veggies would be mush as some had said, but they were just perfect. Others browned the meat. I didn't.I did use a meat mallet to tenderize the meat I wonder if this is what made it so tender-like roast. I made a gravy out of the sauce. My hubby loved it so much. I have never made round steak this tender. Will be making this again.

I browned the meat first, then cooked it in the crock pot with potatoes, carrots, onions, beef broth, homemade cream of mushroom soup and extra mushrooms (about 12oz in all) for 5 hours on high.  I added extra salt and pepper and some parsley, but it could have used a bit more seasoning according to my husband (I thought it was fine).  Oh, but the meat!  It was so tender and tasty!  All of my kids ate it, which is a definite plus:)  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not a fan of cream of mushroom soup with beef, and I was out of cream of celery soup...so I used cream of chicken soup. For 1 pound of beef, I halfed the onion soup mix and added a stalk of celery and half a green pepper. I quarter-cut the potatoes. My fault that it came out more soupy (water from the celery), but it was great over rice.

Just your basic, solid-but-nothing-to-rave-about crock pot stew. It's definitely a classic; reminded me of a similar stew my mom used to make when I was a kid.

I don't whether the meat I used was sub-par, but it was definitely not tender and easy to chew. Will probably try this again because the taste was good, but if it doesn't work out, this recipe will be relegated to the back burner.

This was so-so. Neither my hubs or I were all that impressed (sorry!). I prefer Brenda Arnold's slow cooker pot roast by FAR. It's SO much easier to make gravy when you don't have to pick thru a slow cooker full of veggies. Don't get me wrong. I love a good pot roast with slow cooked veggies, but if given a choice, I like to serve mine on the side. As is, this recipe produces a VERY watered down gravy (ick!). I gave up trying to strain it to make gravy on the stovetop and instead, added 1 T cornstarch dissolved in a T of cold water to thicken. This helped somewhat, but our gravy was still quite runny. My final gripe (my hubs also agrees) is that this was terribly bland for our tastes. We like LOTS of flavor and this just didn't meet our expectations. Maybe this will work for you, but it did nothing for us. Thanks anyways, Katy. :-)

This is a great "throw together" recipe that smells great and works for a busy schedule! 
I used top round steak and baby carrots.  I also added 1 can of sliced potatoes an hour before serving.  Next time I will add mushrooms!  I served with green beans and wide noodles!  Awesome gravy too!

I've made this several times using round and sirloin steak and it's always been good, although I always double the soup/gravy. The last time I made it with a good USDA Choice chuck roast and it was much better as the meat was super tender.

I gave this dish 3 stars because it was just okay for us. Was a little dry. This was too close to a roast dish which has a lot more left overs than this does. Probably wont make it again since we would rather have roast, but it was very easy and took care of dinner. :-)

I thought this recipe was pretty bland.  It was missing something; more spices maybe.  Probably wouldn't make again.  Loved how meat just fell apart though.

I usually cook round steak in a mixture of Cream of Mushroom & Cream of Onion soups, which creates a nice, creamy gravy. This recipe creates a clear, but still rich, gravy, and the potatoes and carrots cook up with a nice flavor.

I used 2 cans of cream of tomato soup and 1 can of water, instead of the onion soup mix.  I also used baby carrots and small whole potatoes.  We liked the flavor, but called it "stoup", a cross between soup and stew--it was a bit runny for our liking.

Very tasty! I am allergic to onions, so used onion powder instead, and did not use the onion soup. I accidentally forgot the water, but it still had gravy. The carrots were too large for my taste, next time I will cut them smaller. I would make this again. :) cheers!

I can't say that I will ever make this again.  I didn't particularly dislike this recipe I just did not find it to be very flavorful.  I would use the base of this recipe, but will add some spices and salt.

It did remind me of a stew, but this is my first time making pretty much anything homemade because I even buy stew from the store!! So I am giving this a four-star rating because everything went really well together, but I didn't like the meat. I don't know what I did wrong, but hopefully I can try another cut or something. Oh, and didn't add the onion because my whole family doesn't like them, but did add corn to the mix. Thanks!

This is a wonderfully delicious recipe, and VERY easy too.  I've already made it twice in the past week.

I really liked this dish. It was fast and easy to prepare.  My husband compared the end product to stew - I think I went a little overboard on the water portion (I did not use a measuring cup).  The gravy wasn't thick, but not too watery, either.

This was great! This is such a good way to fix pot roast without having such a whole roast to put in! The meat is so tender! Thanks so much

We love sauce and gravy so I usually make at least two cans of mushroom soup with this and a little more water.  We sometimes eat it in a bowl with sour cream and/or Louisiana hot sauce.  Easy way to please people who like different degrees of heat/spicyness.

This was very good!  Thank you for sharing it!  I added 2 sliced stalks of celery with it and it was great!  I will remember this one.
