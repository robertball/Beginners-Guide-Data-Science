ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! However, I have to say that I am surprised by the mixed reviews. Some found it too dry, others too sweet, others too bland... Well, here's what I did: I halved the recipe since I only needed a small batch. I did NOT cut the sugar. And HERE'S A TIP: Think about how you like your cornbread- not sweet, moderately sweet, or Southern sweet. I am from SC, and I like mine nice n sweet, so that's why I didn't cut the sugar. But if you don't like sweet cornbread, adjust the sugar accordingly. Also, I grated a whole onion (even though, when halved, the recipe calls for 1/2 onion). Grating allows you to get tiny pieces of onion AND the onion "juice." With the onion juice, I didn't have to add any milk or buttermilk. I just mixed thoroughly. Also, since I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SELF-RISING FLOUR, I added 1/2t baking powder to the batter, and also 1t salt (remember, I halved the recipe). These didn't last long with my 1 and 3 year old. Okay, fine, I had more than my fair share, too! Awesome recipe! 5 stars any day!

These were really good.  I did not have any self-rising flour, so I just used all cornmeal.  I cut the recipe in half since it is only my husband and I.  I also only added in 1tbs of sugar because I knew that anymore would make it too sweet.

These are awesome.  I tried another recipe on this site and was very disappointed.  I had to try another recipe since I still had the taste for hush puppies.  I took suggestions from others and cut the amount of sugar down to 1/4 cup, added garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper.  I also added a can of creamed corn and the batter was perfect, no milk needed.  Let the batter sit for 10 minutes before frying.  I can't wait to make these again.

I grew up in the South and these were just like the ones we had in the old days. I made half the batter like the recipe and then updated the other half with minced Jalepeno, fresh corn, some salt and cayenne. My family preferred the more updated version but the ate everything they could get their hands on.

Excellent! I found that it was nessesary to add a 1/4 cup of milk to the mixture, as others had suggested. My husband said this one is a keeper!

I used this recipe for the church fish fry and everyone raved over the hush puppies and ask for the recipe.  I enlarged the batch to serve 50.  Don't be fooled into adding extra liquid it will work up, use your hands.

THESE WERE GREAT! I’m in CA and our homesick friend from Georgia told us to make these.  I gave it 4 stars because I added a few things.  Added about 1 tsp Chili Powder, 2 tsp Garlic powder& 1 tsp Onion powder with more milk as other suggested.  I used regular flour and cornmeal but added 1 tsp of baking powder (not sure if it changed anything) My picky Fiancé even ate them (he says he's allergic to onions :) and our friend from Georgia said they were almost as good as his mom’s :)  We dipped these in tarter sauce and served w/ Fried Catfish YUMMM!!!

I have made this about 6 times since May, each with rave reviews.  My aunt was always the hush puppy queen in the family, and my husband didn't care for mine.  Now he and my aunt wants to know what I've changed.  THIS IS MY SECRET!  I do add buttermilk to the recipe and they are just fabulous.  Thanks.

These were a little dry, I added milk. I also removed the sugar, for I don't like my hushpuppies sweet. I didn't really care for these, I guess I have to keep searching for an "unsweet" hush puppy recipe.

I did not use the onion since my 6 year old will not eat anything with an onion in it, so I used onion powder (pretty sneaky, huh!)garlic powder and cayene pepper.  I had to use some buttermilk to get the correct consistency.  It was very dry when I mixed it up. However, it was a good hush puppy and I plan to make them again.  Thanks Vicki for your recipe!

I gotta say; the five stars is not exactly for the true recipe; so I hate to give it FIVE; but my rendition would have gotten TEN stars! First; I didn't have self rising flour OR cornmeal.  Second; I completely forgot about the onion; (duh) although would have minced it as one person suggested.  I halved the recipe cause there is only four of us; and it makes a LOT of hush puppies.  I made about 20 hush puppies with half the recipe.  I used 1/2 cup flour, cornmeal.  1 egg; about 1/3 can creamed corn.  2 tbsp of sugar.  Pepper, salt and cayenne pepper to taste. *approx 1/4 tsp cayenne*.  It was a bit moist so I added just a touch more cornmeal.  OH!  And the self-rising situation?  I used about 2 tsp of baking powder to ensure a light and flaky puppy. IT WORKED!  My husband HATES anything with corn in it; especially creamed corn.. he ate 10 of the puppies himself! Used tartar sauce from this site.  I don't think I've ever tasted a better puppy! THANK YOU SO MUCH!

These were really delicious.  Only change I made was adding a little dried chives.  I like the sweetness but my wife wants to reduce the sugar just a bit next time.  Also, for my personal taste I will add just a bit of salt. The wetness will  vary quite a bit with the size and juiciness of the onion (Vidalias are quite juicy) so you might want to mix your dry and wet ingredients separately and then gradually add the wet to the dry until you have a consistency that will drop from your scoop or spoon in a nice glob. All said, this is the best hush puppy recipe I've tried. Thanks for sharing.

These were nice and sweet. I added sweetcorn. I, like another reviewer, served them with honey butter. I halved the batter so that I could have some hush puppies that were more savoury, since that's what I prefer. I added minced jalapeno peppers, more sweetcorn and some Tony's (cajun)seasoning. I served them with ketchup and with mayo mixed with Tony's seasoning. They were delicious.

I am from Mississippi where we like our hush puppies hot, sweet and some folks slice them open and spread butter on them. Catfish fillets, bluegill and crappie dunked in seasoned cornmeal and fried are a staple on Fridays and NOTHING accommodates fried fish like hush puppies and slaw. This is a terrific recipe! Stone-dead simple, sweet and delicious!

I often dice jalapenos and add them to this. If your batter is too thick, add an ounce or two of beer to lighten and add moisture. Add plenty of salt and pepper for a little kick. Use a small spoon because they really puff up a lot when they hit hot (preferably peanut) oil.

I made my jalapeno-incarnation of this recipe for an office fish fry... my cooking partner said "too many puppies..." None remained. Many staffers wanted the recipe.

If you're from the South, you know this is the real deal.

I loved these hush puppies!  There is a little restaurant near our home called the "Catfish Hole", they made the best hush puppies in the world, NOW I CAN.  I did add a very small amount of buttermilk to  the mixture because it was very dry.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft in the center.  Delicious!

Oh Vickie, thank you for this incredible recipe!  I always pick my recipes based on ratings and yours had so many good ones that I knew it would be the right one.  It's simple, uses ingredients that most people have one hand, and it's GOOD!  After reading other reviews, I knew I wanted sweet hush puppies, so I used a whole cup of sugar and added a little bit of milk to loosen up the batter.  I used an extra large star tip and pipped the batter into the hot oil.  Next time I'll add more things like green onions, celery, or red pepper flakes.  Also, I'll probably cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  Thank you again, Vicki and to everyone who rated and reviewed this recipe!

This is a really good base recipe for hush puppies. You can add anything you like. I like mine plain so I followed the recipe. The amount of sweetness was to my liking but I like things sweet, my mom said they were too sweet for her tastes.

I don't have self rising flour and cornmeal so I used all purpose flour and regular cornmeal and added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder before blending together everything. I used a small ice cream scoop to drop balls into a deep fryer and I got nice, round, uniform shapes.

We enjoyed this very much, we ate all of them. I read through a few reviews and one said to grate the onion instead of chop it. I did that, my kids liked them and weren't sitting there picking out the onions. For the I only used a few TBS. sugar, because we don't like our cornbread too sweet. I did follow the suggestions of garlic, cayyene and salt. I added only enough milk to moisten the batter. Oh and make sure you use only a small spoonful of batter or eles the outside will be done and the inside will be doughy.  Cook on med-heat. Try what works best for you.

I have been making hush puppies for many years, and these are the best I have ever made. They rolled into balls perfectly, and I placed them in the fridge for 30 minutes before frying. If you have a problem rolling them into balls, remember that hush puppies do not have to be perfectly round. My Mom and Grandmother used to just drop them by the spoonfulls into the grease. I added a few diced jalapenos and they were as perfect a hush puppy as I have ever eaten. Thank you so much!

These were really really good. They were restaurant quality. I followed the recipe exactly. Though I mixed it well, it turned out to be a little dry so I used a splash of milk to make it workable. I served them with fried fish and my family raved about it. Thank you.

I don't know where Vicki C is from, but it's not Louisiana!  We don't make our hushpuppies so sweet or fluffy.  Also, we usually add hot water to ours, so the process is also different, which wouldn't have been a problem had they tasted right.  I did like the fact that the little suckers turned themselves over in the oil, but that also tells me there's too much baking powder.  However, hubby liked them so this recipe will get a couple of stars.  Sorry, Vicki, I'll post my old recipe when I get around to it!

These were not at all what we think of as hush puppies.  To us, they were very dry, VERY dense, and overwhelmingly egg-tasting.  You would be better off using Aunt J's self-rising yellow cornmeal mix, following the directions for cornbread, omitting a little liquid, adding chopped green onions, 3-4 T of sugar total and dropping them in a deep fryer until golden on all sides.   I'm going to start working on my own recipe - my entire family are puppie connoisseurs and this is just not our idea of a hush puppie, but I still want a good from-scratch recipe.  Minced green onions, some sweet yellow onions, MAYBE some chopped fresh corn kernels, golden yellow, light and puffy with no overt egg taste.  That's a puppy!  Sorry, this just wasn't for us.

AWESOME!!! I love these little golden nuggets of deep fried YUM!!! These beat any seafood joint around here. Cannot wait to make them again. Knowing our taste for cornbread, I omitted the sugar altogether. Thanks for sharing!

Mmm mmm mmm! I was hunting around for a major food comfort recipe and stumbled upon these. I thought making hush puppies would be such a daunting task so have never tried before, but these were SO easy to prepare. I only made quarter of the recipe since it was just for me and I scaled all ingredients except for sugar (I used about 1/4c?) since I wanted them somewhat sweet. I also grated the onion as I thought I would prefer the texture that way, and added just a droplet of milk at the end since the batter seemed a bit dry. This recipe seems to be pretty forgiving since I was measuring very lazily. I was in and out of the kitchen in 15 minutes easily. YUM-MY, these were delicious and did just the trick I will be making these again and again  (yum!). Thanks Vicki C :)

These were waay too sweet. Tasted more like a funnel cake than hush puppies. Need about 1/10 the amount of sugar!!!

Made this recipe for dinner.  It was amazing.  It took me back to family reunions with heaping plates of hush puppies.  I cut up the onion in the food processor and then dumped everything else in and mixed it up.  I didn't have self-rising flour and added a teaspoon of baking powder and some seasoned salt.  I didn't need to add in any additional liquid as others mentioned.  This is going to be my go to recipe from now on!

This is the perfect hush puppies recipe! I did make a couple small changes: For one, I added sea salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I grated the onion instead of dicing. This added moisture to the dough, and gave it a better flavor. I think if the onion was in chucks, it would throw off the texture - hush puppies are not supposed to be chunky. Also, I omitted the sugar. It just didn't sound right to me. I'm so glad I did too, because this turned out so delicious.  This is definately my go-to recipe for hush puppies!

Very Good!  I cut back on the sugar and used onion powder in place of minced onion.  I used a small cookie scoop spayed with pam.  Batter made about 18.  Next time I will cook slightly longer and my centers were a bit gooey.

These were better than any hush puppies in the restaurants around! There were very quick and easy to make. I used an icecream scoop half filled with batter to drop them in the fryer. The icecream scoop really made them perfectly round.
I would recommend this recipe to everyone who loves hush puppies!

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

UPDATE:  We cut the sugar and onion quantity a little and sliced the onions very thin.  This was a huge difference - still sweet, but not overwhelming.  Next time - - we'll add minced jalapeno's!  

Super yummy and easy recipe!  I couldn't find "self-rising cornmeal" so just used 1 cup cornmeal and added 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt to make it self-rising.  

Next time, I'll cut the onions much smaller - minced, probably.

We may try to cut back on the sugar just a tad and add miced jalepenos to spice it up a bit.  

Excellent, easy recipe!

We live in Ontario and wondered what the heck a hush puppy was. We had it on good authority (friends from Tennessee) that they're pretty tasty, so we had to give these a try. Now I know what we've been missing. They taste like little deep-fried corn muffins with onion in them. I didn't have the self-rising ingredients, so I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of salt as suggested in other reviews. I added 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels that had been chopped fairly small, and the moisture that was created as they thawed added enough moisture to the batter that I didn't need to add any milk as suggested by other reviewers. They were absolutely delicious. I think they would taste great alongside a bowl of chili. Thanks for the great recipe.

This were the WORST I've ever had!  I was a little dubious given the amount of sugar, but I usually try a recipe as given before I start tinkering with it. My husband is form the north and likes sweet cornbread and even he didn't like them.

I halfed the sugar in this recipe and they were still WAY too sweet. A tablespoon of sugar and the addtion of some salt would have been good.  Also, I wish I had followed the other reviewers suggestions and added some milk or other liquid because they were too dry.  I tried one and threw the rest out.

I gave this recipe three stars because it's a good start, but doesn't have everything. For those of you complaining that it's too bland - you need to put some seasonings in this - I know you didn't expect you were just going to eat onion, flour, cornmeal, and sugar and it was going to taste great!? Try putting garlic powder, black pepper, seasoning salt, cajun seasoning, and red pepper flakes in it to kick it up. I know it sounds like a lot - but start with a little and go up from there - this is really trial and error - season it to how you like it - if you like hot - add spicy seasonings - if you like salty - kick up the salt. Cook a couple then taste it to see if you like what you put in it and then add more or next time you know to add less. Also cook these on medium-low heat - it takes a little longer, but they are able to cook all the way through without getting too dark. Also you need milk for this start out with a little and add it as you go along - your batter should be moist, but it should still hold it's shape and be kinda thick - to test it scoop up a spoonful of it and it should take it a few seconds before it falls off of the spoon. Also when they're done, sprinkle a little salt on them.

I didn't have self rising flour, so I added 1.25 tsp of baking powder,  and 1/2 tsp. of salt. I used regular yellow cornmeal. And I grated a small onion instead of dicing it. The batter did appear dry, so I worked it with my hands and formed the balls that way. The dough was delightfully soft and moist. I didn't change the sugar or anything, and there was no need to add extra seasonings. My family said these were the best hush puppies they've ever had.

I'd never made hush puppies before and these were delicious!  They were a big hit at our fish-fry.  I did add a touch of milk to the batter to bring it together and it worked out fine.

This was an easy recipe; however, it is missing an ingredient. You must add some liquid (milk is the usual addition). 2 eggs does not provide enough liquid for 2 1/2 cups of dry ingreds. I would give this a 5 if the recipe were correct.

Pretty Yummy - I made my batter the day before so party day would be easy. I minced the onion and a seed Jalapeno into the batter, and used the buttermilk like others had said. I thought they were good, my guests said it needed a dip or something. Will make again.

Loved it!!! I am now using this in my restaurant. The customers love it. My only issue was how to 1 oz scoop the batter out into a commercial fryer. Well, I learned to let the batter sit room temp. PERFECT!!!

This was a great recipe.  Thanks Vickie.  I made a few changes.  Since I didn't have self rising flour and cornmeal I used a 1/4 oz packet of Yeast and 1/2 cup warm water.  I also added a 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Yummy...

Fabulous! Used creamed corn and added a bit more flour and cornmeal to thicken. Used half vegetable oil and half corn oil to fry. Mmm! Tasty!

These are great - remind me of my grandma's with one little change. I add a little milk so they're not so dry, and omit the sugar entirely. Because when they're fried up and ready to serve, I sift a bit of powdered sugar over them and it's just the slightest hint of sweetness that just puts them over the top!

Pretty good! I halfed the sugar per other reviews (next time I think I may actually quarter it) and added some paprika.  I don't like frying food, so I baked these instead and they were still great! Thanks :)

These were as good as any hush puppies I've had, and I loved hush puppies - I have had all kinds.  A few changes: we only did 1/4 c sugar, added salt and pepper, and added 1/4 c buttermilk.  Substitute green onions if that's how you like your hush puppies.

I made a half-batch to test the recipe, and I added some changes of my own and from reviews. I used 1 egg, 2 TBS sugar, maybe 2 or 3 TBS finely chopped onion... I also used more like 3/4 cup flour, ½ cup cornmeal, and 1½ tsp baking powder. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne, plus I added around 1/3 cup of canned kernel corn. It was too thick, so I added maybe 1/4 or 1/3 cup of milk plus 1 tsp vinegar. They turned out yummy! They still need something, maybe some seasoning salt or something... And next time, I think I'll make the batter a little thicker so I can roll it out into little balls like the hush puppies from the fried chicken place two blocks from here. Thanks, Vicki, they were pretty good, especially dipped in syrup!

These were absolutely awesome.  We just returned from vacation in Florida and sampled quite a few hush puppies and these won hands down!!  they were easy and fun to make.  I didn't have self rising flour so, I used all purpose and it worked just fine!

Halved the recipe and only used about a tablespoon of sugar. I did have to add a little milk and grated the onion as others suggested. Turned out perfect! Just like my mom's.

this recipe was a little to sweet for my liking. if I were to try it again I would cut back on the sugar and add salt and pepper to the mix. I also had to add an extra egg because the mixture didn't quiet hold together how it should've. I think if you aren't use to having hush puppies a certain way then this is an alright recipe.

These were delicious. They had just the right amount of sugar and actually reminded me of the hush puppies served at one of my favorite seafood restaurants.

From all the times I've tried to make hush puppies, these were the first that everyone has really liked.  I did use my food processor and chopped the onions fine - someone mentioned about grating the onions so there's more juice, but the food processor works great too!  I also use the Whilte Lily Self-rising flour and the White Lily Buttermilk Cornbread mix, which probably makes them on the lighter side.  This is a keeper recipe for sure!

I just got a deep fryer and haven't eaten theses in years. This was so good. I did add a 3rd egg and used corn bread mix in place of the corn meal since I didn't have cornmeal. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This was the first hushpuppy recipe I've tried and there is no reason to look for another. They turned out perfect! I grated my onion and it added just the right amount of liquid to keep the batter from being too dry. I also added a tsp or so of garlic powder for a little extra flavor. These disappeared quickly at our family fish fry!

If you do the recipe exactly as it tells you, with the cornmeal...it's not as good as it could be. The first time I made this recipe, I didn't have cornmeal, so I used instant corn masa flour. When I used instant corn masa flour, the hush puppies were amazing and I had a couple family members try them and they said that they were the best hush puppies that they had ever had. They were more floury and sweet. The last time I did them, I used cornmeal. I was extremely disappointed. These hush puppies were pretty average restaurant type ones (I hated them), you couldn't taste the onion because the cornmeal was overpowering, they weren't soft or floury. If you change the recipe, it'd be a five for me, but since the recipe calls for cornmeal, it honestly ruins the hush puppies as well as this review. My advice is to switch out the cornmeal for corn masa flour if you like sweeter hush puppies where you can taste the onions and they aren't so dry.      

Also, when I cooked the hush puppies the first time (with corn masa flour) they were easy to fry, not too sticky or hard to handle. The cornmeal ones were incredibly difficult to fry because they were a sticky mess. 

I see reviews over and over on it being too sweet, I live in the South everything needs to be sweet from our tea to our hush puppies!

These were SUPER dry. I added about 1/2 cup of milk, some corn & butter extract flavoring. After all of that, they finally came out good.

By far the best Hush Puppies I've ever had.  I made them gluten free by subbing the flour for chick pea flour and 1 tbsp of baking powder (to make it self rising).

I made these for a fish fry I had a few weeks ago, my family loved them. The kids said they were better than the well known seafood chain in our area. I did add several dashes of Tabasco which helped balance out the sweetness. Absolutely loved them!!

I did need to add about 1/4 C milk - it was WAY too dry the way it is written (did anyone successfully make it without any added liquid?). I also had no self rising corn flour or flour, so I added 1t of baking soda. I also used a shake of salt, and some pepper. With those changes made - this recipe was great! Next time I am planning on sneaking a cube of pepper jack cheese inside each one.

I rolled these guys like cookies to keep them pretty. My only problem was that they are incredibly dense. I like my puppies a little fluffier. Over all pretty tasty, although my husband requested more spice next time. :o) Thanks.

I needed a base recipe since I lost the one I fell in love with so long ago..This recipe, as stated,  made more than I needed and were dry and sweet but still a little bland. (Will be perfect if you're feeding several though.) I tweaked it the second time by adding green onions instead of white and little less than a 1/4 cup of milk (I aimed for a very thick gravy consistency) salt and pepper, reduced the sugar to only 1tbsp and adding 1/2tsp garlic powder and a pinch of cream of mustard powder (the only ingredients I was sure was in the old recipe.) Turned out awesome this go round! However, if you prefer them sweet rather than savory, keep the sugar. Thanks Vicki!

These were far to sweet of a hush puppy for my taste, almost like a dessert or something.  I was worried about the sugar and now I wished I would have cut back.  They have a great texture though and without all the sugar, these would be perfect!

OMG. I just consumed way more hush puppies than any one person should eat! I was worried because I didn't have self-rising flour or cornmeal, but I just added 2 Tbs. of baking powder and 1 tsp. of salt and they came out just fine. I also didn't even have onions on hand, so I had to substitute about 1/4 c. of dried chopped onion. Worked great! They really do taste like the kind you get in the south. I put in not quite half a cup of sugar and probably would add a little less next time, but they were still great. I accidentally fried the first few a little too long and they came out a bit dry. Next time I will take them out when they're more golden than brown. I can't wait to make these again for company and add jalapenos!!

Yummy and easy to make. I halved the recipe for my family and it still made plenty for leftovers. I also decreased the amount of sugar but added half a can of creamed corn. Husband said it was a bit sweet (he doesn't like sweet cornbread at all) but still really enjoyed them.

Next time I will halve the sugar and increase the onion. I followed another user's suggestion and shredded the onion to good effect. I also added 1 tsp of baking powder instead of using self rising flour/cornbread. Next time I will increase the flour by a 1/4 c. and add 1/2 tsp of salt.

I have never been a big fan of hush puppies, but my husband loves them so I decided to try this recipe out one night when we were having oven fried shrimp. They were a HUGE hit, he is such a critic of hush puppies and said these were among the best he's had! Also, they are so easy to whip together...that they aren't a hassle to make.  We used our deep fryer to cook them up and just cooked them till golden brown! Next time I may try to use splenda to see if I can lighten up the batter just a bit for the healthy conscious! Definitely worth a try!

Had to add about 1/4 cup of milk, was a little runny...but still "fryable". I added about 2tbsp more of flour, but it would have been ok without it. Definitely a keeper! Oh, by the way, I did not have any self rising flour, so I added about 2 1/2 tsp of baking powder so it would be fluffier. Enjoy?

Wow!   Excellent, I did use Backing Powder & salt. Also, it was necessary to add two Tbs of milk as the batter was very thick.  I also added some diced jalapeno as well as the onion - WOW!!!   Hope you all enjoy!  Ken Fat Man's Kitchen

This is one of those recipes that needs no changes.  I believe when preparing any new dish the first time, it should be done exactly as instructed.  Then make alterations.  This recipe is very simple and extremely delicious.  This recipe needs no changes. NOT ONE!!  I believe great flavor is more than just adding a long laundry list seasonings.  Anything added in this one is a sin.

I added salt about 1/2 tsp and be sure to fry on medium low because if the dough cooks too fast, the middle is gooey.  Also drop in small balls of dough, I used a small cookie scoop about half full.  The taste, with the salt, was very good.

Yummy! I didn't have self-rising cornmeal or flour, so I used regular flour and cornmeal and added 3 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. They are on the sweet side, which I love, but they would be great with less sugar. Fried them on the stove using a 12 qt Calphalon dutch oven, which really helps regulate the oil temperature. Delicious!

I made our favorite pulled pork (eastern NC style), cole slaw and you can't have pulled pork without a great hushpuppy. Well, this one is beyond great. I didn't change a thing. Caught hubby with the 3 leftovers and a tall glass of tea. He said they were just too good to be considered a "left over"! We have a new favorite. Thank you.

Delicious and easy! These are better than hush puppies from any restaurant, hands down. I added a little bit of garlic powder to my batter and I used a food processor for the onion. It brought out a lot of the onion juice which I think gave it some extra flavor. I also didn't have self rising corn meal so I used 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and and enough cornmeal to make 1 cup out of the mixture.

Soooo good.  Made them the first time with regular cornmeal and flour and added a bit of baking powder.  Perfect.  Made them as the recipe says the second.  Both times, amazing.  Very moist inside but crispy on the outside.    We made these after frying some fish (in the same oil) and they were the BEST.  Honestly better than any I've had elsewhere.

These were very good, just a little sweet and not greasy. I did add a little milk, just enough to make a nice batter.
Next time, I may add a few jalapenos just for an added kick.

The sugar is unnecessary here and as per yayforsprinkles' review, we left it out, and nothing was really changed. These little fried dough balls are yummy alongside boiled/fried shrimp, soft shell crab, etc. and seafood sauce. Best eaten in the summer.

I halved the recipe and added 1/8 cup of milk as suggested by many and a pinch of salt. I ended up with about 20 golf ball sized hush puppies. These were good except for some graininess in the middle. I didn't find them too sweet.

AWESOME!  This is the hush puppie recipe I've looked for for years!  Light, fluffy and sweet.  I added 1/4 cup plus a couple of teaspoons milk and they came out perfect.  Had to leave out onion (kids again) and still great.  Highly recommend!

These were fabulous.  I added a tsp salt and a can of corn.  I had to add a little more flour and cornmeal because of the added moisture from the corn so the scoups would stay together in the oil.  Just slipped them in my deep fryer for 3 min and perfection.

I usually dont' like hush puppies but these were GREAT!!!.  They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with a little touch of sweetness.  We thought there wasn't enough liquid with one egg but if you keep stirring its the perfect amount.  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

These hush puppies are absolutely the best! I followed directions exactly with the exception of three simple things a little different ....

1) I used sweet onion grating half the onion with the fine side of the hand grater directly into bowl.  The grated onion will be pulpy wet in batter, then finely chop the other half and add. 

2) Throw in a splash of buttermilk. This moistens the batter and brings out a delightful flavorful  dimension!

3) Frying last in oil used for seafood, the hush puppies take on that fish flavor that truly makes them sing on your taste buds!!!

Go ahead and make the batter a day ahead, keep covered in refrigerator, bring them to room temp before frying.

 Everyone will rave! This is my only "go to" recepie for hush puppies !!

delicious and easy. did it as-is, but added 1 tablespoon of baking powder, since I didn't have self-rising stuff (rule of thumb: 1 1/2 teaspoons of bp per cup of flour. Count the cornmeal as flour, since this recipe called for the self-rising version of both. so 2 cups=1 1/2t x 2=3t=1T ). I also added fresh corn, and used just a touch of the corn liquid to make the batter just the teeniest bit wetter. make them smaller than you think you should, as they puff up a lot. great texture, just enough sweetness.

These were great. Texture was perfect and they fried up nicely. My recommendations: add 2 tablespoons buttermilk, 1 Tbs cayenne pepper, lots of garlic salt, and do NOT cut out the sugar as some other reviews suggested. I would also suggest using half white onion and half green onion. I think that will give these some more variation in the flavor (and color).

These are delicious! I followed DivineHealth7's advice and grated the onion.  The onion juice added the right amount of liquid, and I didn't need any milk.  I don't buy self-rising flour or cornmeal so I added 1 tsp of salt, and 1 TB of baking powder.  I mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately before combining everything.  I let batter rest while the oil was heating, and used a small portion scoop to drop the batter into the oil.  I like sweet cornbread, and found these to be just right.  Thanks, Vicki!

Thought the hush puppies were way too sweet. The texture was okay but they tasted like onion doughnuts...  May be better with less or no sugar.

This were light and tasty on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside. I used more baking powder and salt to make up for not having self-rising ingredients (looked up measurements). I grated the onion and the flavor permeated the hush puppy. Mmmmm!

The best Hush Puppy recipe I've ever made!!! I grated a Vidalia onion & let it sit a little while to get a good onion juice going. I halved the sugar since I like my cornbread equally sweet/savory & I added 1T. Cajun Seasoning + 1-pkg. Green Onion, chopped. Fried PERFECT with a cookie scooper to make balls and my boys LOVED them! No Milk Needed here, that's a 1st for me! You HAV E to try these ;-)

I just made the recipe and it is absolutely delicious. I added two celery sticks finally chopped and a half a cup of sweet creamed corn and some garlic powder, black pepper and salt to taste and it turned out amazing.  I'll be making these later for our Labor Day party and I'm sure they will be a hit.

Very good base recipe. I changed around a few things like many here. I half the recipe and added 1/2 c sweet corn. Plus I mixed separately the dry ingredients (sifted), then beat 1 egg with a little buttermilk. Did not use self-rising flour and cornmeal. Just added baking powder to the regular stuff. Make sure to add salt, pepper and seasoning for taste. Good start. May play with it a little more. Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I really enjoyed these. My kids did not which surprised me since they were extremely sweet. If I were making them again, I would decrease the sugar slightly and add a little extra onion. Overall, I would highly recommend them. They are one of the better hush puppies I have had.

One of the best recipes I've gotten from this site, honestly. It was 100% perfection. These hush puppies were the best I've ever had! Even my hubby said they were better than the ones at Red Lobster (and he LOVES that place)! I did, however, make two small changes. I used onion powder instead of onions (don't like onions) and I only used a 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 (I don't like my hush puppies THAT sweet, plus it makes it a smidgen healthier). Anyway, love love love these! Already planning to make them again next week. :)

I am rating this recipe as written. The mixture was so dry that the mixing bowl was just filled with a mess of crumbles. Yes, I then added milk to create "a different recipe", but THIS is recipe did not work for me and will not be going into my recipe file.

I, like so many others, have tried many Hush Puppie recipes,but this one is the last I will ever try...it was excellent!!! I read over the other reviews and made similar changes for my preferences. I used 1/2 the sugar, used green onions and added some buttermilk to get the proper consistency. I made a 1/2 recipe, well then made the other 1/2 because my Dad and I ate the first batch waiting for our dinner guest :) Needless to say my Dad, who is from NC, and our dinner guest, who is a Hush Puppie lover, really enjoyed them!!!!!

This is my "go to" recipe for hushpuppies.  I rated it shortly after I started using it but want to throw in that I started using two green onions chopped up and it adds just that little extra.  You can cut down on some of the other onion if you want.  The green color also adds to the presentation.  Little bits of green onion.  Yummy.  If I could give this a 10, I would.  Oh, and also, Not to sweet at all!

I have made these a couple of times now for neighborhood functions, and they are amazing!  I added about 1/2 t. of salt, and used a medium pampered chef scooper to drop them into the oil, making them just a bit bigger than the original recipe.  They have gotten rave reviews both times I have made them, and they will remain in my recipe box for good.  Be careful when frying them.  Even at a larger size they were cooked all the way through just as they turned golden brown which only takes a few seconds.

have to start with this review with a HUGE thank you! I was grocery shopping Sunday morning and spur of the moment my teenagers wanted fried fish & hush puppies for lunch. My daughter had her wisdom teeth pulled a few days earlier and was craving real food. I had everything I needed except the mix for hush puppies. When I've made them before it was always one of those "just add milk" mixes. The store was out of mixes and also the bags of frozen ones. So I'm standing in the aisle              searching Google for an easy home made recipe and yours was the 1st that sounded down home good. I grabbed the ingredients, went home and followed your recipe to the letter and oh oh oh....I'll never make hush puppies any other way again! It was so easy and we devoured them! Now it's Monday night and my son wants some more to eat while watching a movie. This deserves 10 stars! THANK YOU!!!!

these were really good, but like others I had to had some liquid to the mix.  I added just a "tad" of buttermilk and a "tad" of whole milk; that seemed to help a lot.  Then, I used my Pampered Chef scoop so they were uniform in size.  I wish I would have had this recipe back when my daughter was small - she loved "hush 'em up pups" (as she called them!).  I'll make these again.

My 'batter' came out so dry that I kept running back to the computer to make sure I hadn't done something horribly wrong. It was like a big bowl of breadcrumbs! Maybe y'all's eggs are bigger than mine? I ended up adding a bit of milk & that sorted it out. Once the batter crisis was over, though, they were truly wonderful. My family loved them and gobbled them all up, even my picky two-year old.
Next time, I'll try grating the onion as other reviewers have mentioned and see if the onion juice helps combat the dryness I ran into today.

I halved the recipe. I didn't have self rising flour so I added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt. I minced the onion and added a dash of cayenne pepper. Follow the recipe and it came out fantastic. This was the taste that I was craving because to be honest, some hush puppies are terrible. Btw, my daughter loved them

Not bad. I used red onions instead of white onions, and they gave the hushpuppies a little bite. However, they needed salt.

Just popped one of these babies in my mouth. Delicious! They are a little sweet, but I'm from the South and we like it that way! Didn't have but one egg, so I added a splash of milk to wet the batter a little more. Wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing!

These were absolutely awesome! We made a batch last night altering the ingredients just a tad as I had to use dried onion instead of fresh and we decided to add bacon, because EVERYTHING is better with bacon, and while we were at it, added some minced garlic. The result was a heaping plateful of hushpuppies that were devoured in no time. Thank you for the super simple, but delicious recipe.

Although many reviewers feel that these are too sweet, I disagree.  I like the sweetness but still think that they need "more.'  Canned corn, Old Bay, garlic powder, pepper, salt, jalapeños, etc.   Also,per other reviews, I added a couple of tablespoons of milk and let the mixture sit for a couple of minutes to thicken.    With these changes, I think that the hush puppies are excellent.

These are great! My family loved them! They are so simple to make and fast to fry. I will say that next time I will mix them a little longer and make them a little smaller so they are lighter. Overall though, this is the best recipe I have found for awesome puppies!

These were delicious but I'm not sure how anyone could make them without adding milk or buttermilk....I never would have been able to mix mine up without some more liquid!  I added about 1/3 of a cup of buttermilk and they turned out perfect.

If you're looking to make hush puppies, this is the recipe to use.  I used all-purpose flour and added a half teaspoon of baking soda.  I also added a splash of milk and a 1/4 tsp of pepper to the batter.  Both me and my husband said, "Tastes like a hush puppy" which I suppose is the reaction we would want.

I really loved this recipe...I halfed the recipe and it made about 9 hushpuppies and I added jalapenos (diced very small) and added about 1/5 of milk and it was delicious!!! Next time I will  probably add about 1/2 of egg to this halfed recipe and a whole egg for the whole recipe.

They were very good, but did have to add some milk to hold them together while cooking.  I also didn't have self rising flour, so I added a bit of baking soda and powder and they came out great..  My step son, who is very picky with food, loved them..

As other reviewers suggested I had to add some milk because the batter was very dry. I used a little less sugar. This recipe make A LOT so next time I will half the recipe! The flavor was good but I think they could use some seasonings in the batter.

I screwed this dish up royally!  The oil was too hot, the puppies broke when turned.  I will leave this dish up to the seafood houses.  I'm sure they would have been fine if I had a baby fryer or something other then my cast iron skillet.

Awesome!  I am 'afraid' of onions so the first time I made these I didn't add all the onions it calls for.  Not too bad, but they are FANTASTIC with the full onion strength.

This recipe is amazing!  I did not need to add any milk...the batter is supposed to be thick.  Next time i'm going to finely dice some jalapeno pepper to give it an extra zing!

These are terrific.  Never made hush puppies in my life but decided to give it a try.  Delicious! Had all-purpose flour and self-rising cornmeal.  Just added 1 tsp of baking powder.  Next time, I will dice the onions super fine and grate them since big pieces are very noticeable.  Also, cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Perfect.

I made these basically by the recipe.  I did not have self-raising so I used all purpose flour and regular cornmeal.  I added 3 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. salt.  I used a yellow onion and put it in my mini-chopper which almost "blended" it.  By doing this, the batter did not seem to need any extra milk or liquid.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and they did not seem too sweet.  They turned out great!  And super easy!

These hush puppies are AMAZING.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out exactly the way they should.  I have tried other hush puppy recipes in the past only to be incredibly disappointed.  I was about to give up hope and think only restaurants could actually make them, until I found this recipe.  Now that we live in Switzerland it's a little piece of Southern US heaven that we can easily make.  Makes me miss Mayflowers in NC!!!  Make this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe does not work as it appears here. There is simply not enough liquid in two eggs to come anywhere near making a dough. It creates a sandy mess instead. If you alter it as other reviewers suggest by adding milk, it will hold together enough to fry them. But then you discover that they are, indeed, incredibly sweet. Like, dessert sweet. AND boring in flavor. AND not a great texture.

After reading many reviews I halved the recipe with minor changes. I added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder & 1 tsp of salt since I did not have self rising flour.  I added 1/4 cup milk and the consistency was perfect.  I felt there was no need to add any more sugar and it was the right amount for us.  I served this with salmon.

I loved the taste of these hush puppies.  I added some cream corn and milk.  I used only 1/4 cup of honey crystals.  It was so good fried in coconut oil.

So simple and so delicious! I ran the onion through the food processor, cut back to 1/4cup sugar, added 1tsp baking powder & 1-1/2tsp salt instead of self-rising meal/flour, and a sprinkle of cayenne. Absolutely perfect.

I have taken suggestions from several other reviews and found a mix that we LOVE!!

1. I halve the recipe, but, I DO NOT halve the amount of sugar. A half recipe will still feed 4 people.

2. I use Splenda instead of sugar (diabetic household).

3. I add Garlic Powder, Salt and Pepper to taste - a few tosses of the shaker, for me.

4. I grate the onion instead of chopping it. This will allow you to get all the juice out of the onion.

5. I add chopped jalepeños. Buy a jar of chopped jalepeños and toss in a few Tablespoonfuls.

6. If you don't have any self-rising cornmeal, use regular cornmeal and add 1/2 teaspoon of Baking Powder to the halved recipe.

I added milk the first few times I made these as many reviewers suggested, but really, I promise, you don't need to add any. The batter should be doughy, not soupy.

Vicki, thank you! These were better than any I have had out! I did add 2 tablespoons of milk to the batter as suggested by Ken of Fat Man's Kitchen as the batter was to dry to me made it perfect so thank you to all! (Only bad thing was I cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us we liked them so much I will make whole recipe next time! )

These were the perfect addition to a steamed shrimp dinner. I did as another reviewer and grated the onion. This was far from dry and like several others mentioned you need to adjust the sugar according to whether you like sweet corn bread or not.

This was very quick and easy to make but it's kinda bland. My daughter loved it and I'll be making it again but adding some spices.

These are by far the best yet! I shredded the onion instead of dicing it and also added one small can of creamed corn and 1/4 C of buttermilk. Delicious! I served it with cinnamon butter for dipping and they were so addictive! The Best!!!

These were fantastic on their own -- which is saying something because I -hate- onions -- but after making the recipe as is and using the first half to make some hush puppies, I decided to throw in some creamed corn (just so that when I tasted something crunchy my mind wouldn't immediately go EW ONION) and that made them even better in my opinion. Absolutely wonderful recipe!

These are far too sweet. Not exactly the southern style hush puppies I thought they were. I would reduce the sugar by at least 75%. I had to throw all of these away.

Perfect hush puppie recipe! Very quick and easy to make. I halved the recipe and and it made about 11 tad bit smaller than golf ball size. Beforehand I was worried about the mix would be too dry since the other reviews said that they used milk, I only used about 3 slices of onion that I finely chopped and I just kept working the batter until in was moistened enough. So glad I didn't use any milk. My husband said the puppies were perfect. This recipe is a definite keeper. Thanks so much!

I used corn oil to fry these.  At first my heat was set to 7 (out of 10) and the oil started smoking, and the dough blackened on the outside and was uncooked on the inside.  I would suggest preheating the oil for 10 minutes on medium low setting (4 out of 10) on your stove-top, and then cooking until golden brown.  I added garlic and jalepenos.  I didn't have self-rising cornmeal or flower, so I added 1 tsp baking powder.  They came out better than any restaurant hush puppies I have had in the South!

Instead of self-rising flour and self-rising cornmeal, per others, I just added 3 t. (1 T.) of baking powder.  It admittedly was on the sweeter side and I know that isn't the traditional Southern style but if you like cornbread that way, you'll like this.  It's not for everyone's taste but it was for ours.  Thanks!

came out great! i'm cheap and just use half the oil, turn them so they cook on both sides; works just as well.  i was OUT OF CORNMEAL, so i used GRITS. made VERY CRISPY hush puppies which we all enjoyed. an interesting variant but not a replacement for puppies!

Wow!! Its the real thing. I only gave it 4 stars b/c i had to tweak it a little bit. I took some advice of reviewers and grated my onion and had to add milk due to being too dry. I also didnt have self rising flour so i added some baking powder. great...will be making again!!

I grated the onion, as was suggested by other reviewers, and it was still way too dry.  Adding 1/2 cup of milk really helped, although it could be a personal preference issue (I prefer hush puppies made with batter that approaches a thick pancake batter).

I've never had Hush Puppies before but I really love cornbread so I decided to make these. I think I should've cut the onions into smaller pieces but all in all, they tasted great! The added sweetness was a nice touch. Will definitely make these again.

I just made these with dinner. I thought they were the perfect looking hush puppies and very good, but too sweet for my (southern) taste. I'd say to halve the sugar (according to your own preference for cornbread) and these would be perfect. Thanks so much for sharing!

These were just not what I was hoping for.  Very very dry.  Needs some kind of additional liquid in the batter. Taste was average - could use some seasoning and we hated the texture.  Sorry.

A little plain, but good. I did add some salt, pepper, cayenne pepper for additional flavor. Also had to add a dash of milk. My husband ate them, so I can't ask for anything more!!

These are supposed to be like the sweet, cake-like hush puppies served at some restaurants, like Captain D's. However, while I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, we still found them too sweet and I added a couple of tablespoons of milk to make the batter thinner.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I grated the onion, added an extra Tbs sugar, added 1/2 tsp baking powder & 1 tsp salt & 2 Tbs corn... since I didnt have the self-rising cornmeal (used all purpose flour). The grated onion juice was the perfect consistency to mix it all together. This recipe was added immediately to my recipe box after dinner. Hubby said "this is just what I wanted, great tasting hush puppies"...enjoy!!     :-)

This was my first attempt at hush puppies, and they turned out great! I only used about 1/4 of an onion and added 1/2 cup of corn to the batter. Perfect batter consistency! Will make again.

KUDOS, Vicki! "Taste just like Captain D's" according to my chief engineer. I found the batter to be just the right consistency. Didn't change a thing with the batter - however, let it sit for 10-15 min and then deep fried them. Excellent taste and sweetness is just perfect for my sweet tooth.

Probably some of the best hush puppies I have ever eaten! They were terific! I brought these to my daughter's girl scout's end of year dinner and to my suprise there were 4 people who have never heard of hush puppies! They were a hit though. I didn't know hush puppies were more of a Southern dish. Several of those yankees asked for the recipe ;)

We liked these exactly as the recipe was written, and dusted with powdered sugar after cooking.  Whether or not you like these appears to depend on where you live and what you consider a hush puppie to be.  Some people complain that these are too sweet, well to me that's how hush puppies are supposed to be.  Others said they added corn, which in my experience is more like a corn fritter than a hush puppie.  If you are trying to decide whether or not to make these, look at the recipe and see if this is what you think a hush puppie should be.  My husband, two young kids, and I really liked these.  Next time I'll probably cut the recipe in half because it made too much for us.

I needed a recipe to help prime my cast iron skillet, and this was good with modifications from other reviewers.  I added some paprika to offset any blandness.  Since I like somewhat sweet cornbread (and hushpuppies are essentially fried cornbread), I didn't cut the sugar at all.  Grate the onions and preserve the onion juice so you don't have to worry about a dry mixture.  Used a cookie scoop to help shape the puppies which yielded about 30 hush puppies.  Good recipe when I'm in the mood for something fried.

I was very displeased with these. I followed the recipe exactly, they were dry, so dry that the cornmeal didnt get a chance to cook properly in the center and was crunchy, way too sweet. Maybe this is a traditional hush puppy but I prefer the restaurant ones any day over these.

Very, Very good! My daughter loves them! 
I did make some changes though... I added 1 teaspoon of Bakeing Powder & used regular Flour instead of Self-rising flour. (they are very good when dipped in ketchup)

This batter was too thick, so I added enough whole milk to make it stick togegher.  I also cut down on the amount of sugar to make it less sweet.  My family enjoyed the hush puppies.  They fried up crisp with good texture.

These were way too sweet and the batter so thick the actual hush puppies were dry inside. I had to add some milk to this. It did make a lot though, I only used half the batter and we had 14 already. Needed more flavor, but hubby and I aren't sure what it needs, maybe onion powder or something? Definitely not sugar. Thanks but no thanks, I won't be making these again.

I cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup and they were still very sweet.  I added the 1/3 cup of corn someone mentioned, and I also had to add milk to get a puffier puppy like I wanted - originally the dough was very dense and heavy.  I will probably continue using with changes, but the rating is for the recipe as written.

I tried this recipe.  It is absolutely DELICIOUS.  I usually buy the mix or follow the directions on the back of the cornmeal bag, but these taste fabulous.  My family loves them and I am making another batch tonight.

Well, this is okay for homemade but some things are just better bought from the store like Martha White hushpuppy mix which is what I usually buy, but I did not have any on hand, so I tried this recipe.  I did decrease the recipe by  1/2 and I did add milk as others have recommended. The flavor was just kind of bland.

These were good in flavor.  I tried frying them in a pan, and that was not a good idea.  I don't usually eat fried food, so I don't own a deep fryer. I don't know why I even tried it.  If you've got one, go for it!

My pups always turn out greasy and mealy, but these were fine. They were too sweet for me, which is what I thought I was going to like about them, but no -- too much. In a half recipe I used a small egg -- pefect, not eggy as some have experience. I used red onion and it was too pungent. I'll use something milder next time and cut down the amount a little bit. Otherwise, this was definately a workable recipe. Very good!

Sounds so much like my mom's recipe, except use buttermilk instead of milk, self-rising flour, cornmeal, chopped green onions, a little salt and some water. Let set in bowl for a few minutes to rise. Drop by small rounded tablespoon full into hot oil.  If using this recipe in a fish fry, gain some extra flavor by cooking in same oil after seafood in done.  Remove when hushpuppies have risen to top, flipped and are golden brown on both sides.

I like hushpuppies with a sweet taste, and found these to be perfect.  My husband really enjoyed them as well.  Don't mix up the batter until right before you are ready to cook them - it rose on me while I was frying the fish. The flavor was good but they were kind of "cakey" since I let the batter rise.

I followed the recipe except I minced the onion in a Cuisinart to start. You may grate the onion as well. The moisture in the onion along with the egg is enough moisture. Added a dash of cayenne. Excellent result.

Light but with texture. I added a seeded jalapeño to the batter just for a little color and heat.

If you follow this recipe as is your hush puppies will be to dry so what I did was add 6 TBS of milk to the sugar and eggs beat it together then add the flour mixture together and you will then make some soft golden hush puppies!!!

These were SO GOOD!   I made these to go with our seafood Christmas dinner and everybody loved them.  Super simple to make, and the only tweak I made was to cut back on the sugar because we don't like hush puppies that are too sweet.  I will definitely be making these again.

These hush puppies turned out delicious!! I grated the onion as suggested by another reviewer and added about a tablespoon of  buttermilk and a dash of cayenne pepper for a kick. My son said it’s the lightest hush puppies he’s ever tasted.

i'll preface my comments by saying that i almost never follow a recipe to the letter, most often i merge/combine recipes based on my tastes and how i want the final product to come out. that was not the case in this recipe and it turned out perfect (although i did use a bit less sugar than the recipe).

i think there's confusion as to what hush puppy batter should be like - about the consistency of cookie dough - and how sweet - personal taste. i suggest with starting with about 1/4th of the amount of sugar that the recipe calls for, and make a test batch of 1 or 2. adjust the sugar from there. runny dough will cause the problems that people have mentioned with them flattening out. when they pop up to the surface, roll them over and let them continue to cook and take them out when they're golden all over. if your oil was hot enough, they'll be perfectly done and not greasy, and tasty.

These are really good. I halved the recipe and had to use all self rising cornmeal mix since I didn’t have any self rising flour and I minced my onion   Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. No more package mix for me.

Hey Vickie...Did you forget part of the recipe? 2 Eggs isn't enough liquid to make a batter. I added water but wasnt sure how much to add. Mine came out as Hush Patties. Not enough onion flavor either.

I added Italian bread crumbs ( a lot), a diced jalepeno, creamed corn, buttermilk, dried parsley, and ragin cajun seasoning....  Consistency was a little runny so I added more bread crumbs!  I could not make round hush puppies to save my life... they looked more like aliens! lol  Tasted wonderful!!

I made these for my daughter's bday when I couldn't find them in the store. We seriously have only ever had them at restaurants and I had no idea how easy they were to make. I added 1/4 milk as some mentioned. Everyone loved them. I may have added a little bit more sugar because I knew my daughter would like them sweeter but you could definitely play with the sugar to suit your preference. Tip: These puff up so just a regular spoon full is good. I over did it on some and they didn't cook through and over cooked on the outside. How people get these in perfect balls is beyond me. They looked like the pieces of chicken you get with your sweet and sour chicken at Chinese restaurants (for lack of a better explanation.) But they are super good, so easy and so fast.

It was OK. The batter was really dense and needed milk to thin it out a bit. The flavor was a bit bland even with the jalapenos I added. Not sure how to fix it....

These are good. Though a suggestion would be to use a piping bag to make nugget shapes instead of ball forms due to over cooking the insides being a greater possibility in ball shape. Over cooking =dry hush puppies

My first time making hush puppies. I added more flour and corn meal since the mix was sticking on my hands. Very good.

These came out quite well...I actually only used 1/3 cup of sugar because I didn't want them too sweet.  Will use this recipe from now on.

These were exceptional! This was my first time and I made it last minute. I had in mind the ingredients, but didn't read the directions before starting. I threw everything in one bowl and was about to start mixing before  reading that the dry ingredients were to be gradually added; so I started scooping out as much ch as the dry ingredients as possible ??.  I then slowing incorporated the dry ingredients. The batter was really thick and crumbly as if it needed liquid.  I dropped one in the hot oil for testing. It was delicious, but still seemed undone and crumbly in the middle. I added about 2 tablespoon  of milk and 1/2 a tablespoon of EVOO, dropped them by smaller spoonfuls and they were
O-M-GEEEE! Everybody loved them! They never actually made it to the table, hands were in the pan as soon as they came out of the oil. Thank you for providing a new addiction!

This recipe does not work as written.

The recipe needs less sugar, less onion, more salt, and more milk or something to give enough moisture to make a uniform dough.  I added a little milk.  

The flavor just was not what I expect for hush puppies.

Great!  Made one batch as directed and another with three jalapeños chopped up and mixed in.  Guests overwhelmingly preferred the flavor of the jalapeño pups.  Thanks for sharing!

Makes a denser, more traditional, southern-style hush puppy. Very good. I did make a change,  omitting the sugar (just for personal preference) and grated the onion. Will make again!

We had company from Georgia so decided to try these along with our fried fresh oysters. Company said the BEST hush puppies they have ever had and living in the south, they have eaten many. These are so light and airy. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 c. and used 1/2 c. of green onions and tops instead of a full onion. I also used 3/4 can of creamed corn in these for moisture and flavor. I  used regular corn meal as the grocery store did not have self rising corn meal. I had a very small scoop and that worked great for dropping in the oil. I did let the batter sit for an hour before frying. Awesome and can't wait to make again. I made a full batch and we ate most of them and put the rest in a Ziplock bag and put in the freezer to reheat.

These were too sweet and too dry. The outside cooked before the center was done; which oozed out. These weren't good at all.

These were a HUGE HIT at a friendly fish-fry!!! They disappeared and people were asking that I make more to bring for other types of potluck dinners. I used a whole can of crm corn and only a few tablespoons of sugar, doubled the dry ingredients for what I had on hand (substituting 1 portion of self-rising cornmeal for Jiffy Brand corn muffin mix, adding about a teas of baking powder, grated 1/2 a large sweet onion as well as 2 bunches of green onions and 2 seeded jalapeno's. Next time, dagnabbit these were GOOD...I'll kick up the spice with a few more jalapeno's. Two weeks later, I'm still getting compliments about these kickin' hushpuppies!! Way to GO, Vick!!! FANTASTIC!!!

I just have to say that this is the very first time I've ever made Hush Puppies and they came out amazing. Read the reviews and judge for yourself. I chopped up my onion in my food processor and added two fresh jalapeno peppers (seeded and de-veined) and threw in a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and cut the sugar down by about half. I also used my cookie scoop and dropped the dough into the deep fat fryer and it made perfect little Hush Puppies . If you have a hankering for Hush Puppies, give these a try! #cookingwithwingman

Decent basic recipe but needed tweaks for my taste. I agree with those who added corn garlic cayenne and jalapeño and 1/8 cup sugar. While admit not a classic puppy that way is yummy.

Tweeted this just a bit by adding two finely chopped jalapeños and just a touch of lemon juice.  Great addition to our seafood dinner.

These hush puppies were just the ticket to satisfy all of the personal preferences in my house!  I did make a few alterations after reading the reviews... The batter did seem much drier and heavier than I expected. I added about  1/3 c of buttermilk and also decreased the sugar to not quite 1/3 c. We will be making these when ever we have seafood!!

I made this as directed with one exception.  I felt like the mix per the recipe was too dry so I added buttermilk to get the consistency I wanted.  I served them with home made Eastern NC pork barbecue to 9 adults and everyone said they were the best they'd ever had. It'll be my go to for hushpuppies from now on. JP from Richmond, VA

I used bread flour instead of self rising flour and I added two tsp baking power.  I didn't have enough oil in my fryer and got burn spots but even that was fine.   These do not taste like or have same texture as long john silver or red lobster hushpuppies but they were really good anyway.  Everyone liked them.

These turned out a bit dry for me. It may be as a result of not using self-rising flour or cornmeal and adding 1tsp of baking powder to make up for it. I probably will not make this again but find a recipe that uses the regular flour and corn meal that I use. I really don't like to buy ingredients when I can use what's on hand.

I followed the recipe as written, except halved, and scooped with a melon baller (about 3/4" round), three at a time into the oil.

365 degrees F seems way too hot: the outsides got dark brown, but the center was still gooey when I broke them in half. I tossed the halves back into the oil and that cooked them completely.

I fried only half of my batch before I gave up and baked a "hushpuppie cake" with the rest.

The flavor was a little bland, but would be easy to customize to one's own tastes. I may make this again, with some of the other reviewers' recommendations, and skip the frying all together - just bake as a deluxe cornbread.

These hushpuppies were better than any I have ever tasted, with one exception...they were too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and I also added a little salt and pepper.   I grated the onion which made the onion just right and generated some much needed moisture.  The batter seemed too dry and I was tempted to add a little milk but I'm glad I didn't  because after it set for a minute or two it was plenty wet.  They were awesome and this recipe it now the one I will always use.

It was pretty flavorless. It wasn't bad, just bland.

Flavor was ok but it was way to dry.  I did reduce the sugar as well only because we don't like sweet hush puppies. I deep fry mine thus not taking as long.

I had to add about a quarter cup of milk and some salt. The original recipe would have been far too dry, as even with the milk they were a little on the dry side. Not bad as a base to start with and then to add a personal touch though, I would think. I would make them again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and did not like them. I thought that they were too doughy, and lacked flavor. I think that I'll try more cornmeal and less flour next time, plus I might add a little Crisco to see what it does to the texture. last, I think that I'll tear them more like biscuits, in that I'll handle the dough very carefully. I did that, but I'll be even more careful. it was mostly that they were heavy and lacking flavor. I'll study on hush puppies a little more before I make them again.

I don't really care for the onions but I love the flavor. I used a tablespoon of onion powder.  I also used about 1/4 cup of milk.

Fantastic recipe! I halved it but I should have made a whole batch because they disappeared! I kept the sugar and grated the onion like previous users had done and that really helped to temper the sweetness and keep those chunks of raw onion to a minimum.

We loved it! I did grate the onion and it added some needed moisture to the batter. It would not hurt to add some additional onion. But overall, I will make again!

These are so good!   The only thing I did differently was add a little milk and cut the onion in half.   My  husband doesnt care for hush puppies, but he tried these and fell in love with them.   He ate five of them with his  fish and grits!   This will be my go to recipe when we have seafood.   Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I enjoyed it, though I did cut the sugar in half because I knew it would be too sweet. I live in a high altitude area  so I did have to add buttermilk to make it more moist.

This is a very good and simple recipe.  I did not have self-rising flour or cornmeal so I had to do some improvisations following the lead of other reviewers...  I added a can of cream style corn (to get it out of my cupboard finally), baking powder, garlic powder, onion powder & dried onions, cayenne pepper & Cajun seasoning.  I used my deep fat fryer and dropped into submerged basket by teaspoons.  They turned out light and perfectly flavored.  My boyfriend LOVED them and said I need to make them regular basis.  I will certainly make these again as they also make a great snack!

This recipe is very good, but I did add 1/4 cup of milk, because the batter was WAY too thick. Also since I didn't have self rising flour or corn meal, I added 2 tip baking powder, and they rose beautifully. Another adjustment I had to make was to fry them in just 1" of oil, turning them to cook evenly. Even with all my meddling, this was a great recipe and will be used many more times. Thanks, Vickie C!

These were okay as a base of sorts. I did need to add milk - as written, it was not even close to wet enough. I didn't put nearly as much sugar, and also put a sprinkle of salt, cayenne pepper, and some minced garlic. Next time, I will add more salt. If prepared as written, it's kind of bland. Some seasonings will go a long way to making these some delicious hush puppies.

I will definitely add some milk next time, because they were a little dry. They were also a touch too sweet, but otherwise tasted really good. Super easy to make too! With a little tweaking, I think this could be a 5 star recipe (for me personally, others may love it exactly how it is).

OK This was my first attempt making Hush puppies I thought these were good!! Not as fluffy and moist as I would have liked But im almost positive it wasnt the recipe it was something I did lol. These have great flavor! Next time i want to try adding some old bay seasoning!I will try this recipe again to see if they turn out a little fluffier and not so dense.Over all a good recipe and very very yummy!!

I didn't care for it. I followed directions exactly. They were too sweet for my taste and a bit on the dry side. I may try again but doctor the recipe by cutting the sugar in half.

These complimented the red grouper we caught off Clearwater Beach yesterday. I did add a little milk in order to form the hush puppies before frying. Perfect for a southern style fish fry.

It was WAY too sweet for me. That's my only complaint. Cut the sugar WAY back unless you like your cornbread SUPER sweet. It was super EZ and fried up great in my fry granpappy. I will use this as my "base" for some experimentation. For comparison, I put 2 T sugar in about my cornbread which is 1-1/2 cup total (corn meal + flour). Proportionally, this recipe is about 4x's too sweet for me.

I am not a huge fan of fried foods so I don’t have a lot of experience making them.  I do however love catfish (caught and cooked by others) and needed to bring something for a fish fry over the weekend.  A few ideas crossed my mind but I settled on hush puppies and am so glad I came across Vicki’s recipe.  These were wonderful and totally made me appear to be a frying pro!  

For anyone who may be a little apprehensive…  1.) NOT dry – putting the onions (and a jalapeno and few heads of garlic)  thru the food processor released moisture which added to the batter. Grating would have the same effect.  2.) Sugar quantity is to your liking – I only used ¼ cup and felt that was perfect for us 3.) Spice it up (or not) I added garlic and a jalapeno, garlic salt and Tonys seasoning.  If I were making for just my family I would have added cayenne and a lot more jalapenos 4.) Go ahead, make the batter in advance – this worried me the most since the batter didn’t hit the fryer until 2 hours after making it. 5.) No worries at the fryer! Once they were browned on the outside the inside was perfectly cooked.

Excellent! For more flavor, instead of dicing I grated 1/2 of an onion and 2 cloves of garlic to the batter.  I also added diced jalapenos, 1/2c corn and 1/4c of milk.

Made this as written and it was a bit too sweet. Next time I will decrease sugar to 1/4 cup. Added a chopped jalapeno and some garlic salt and flavor was better.

Recipe MUST be missing a liquid ingredient! Since I was trying it out, I halved the recipe and added 1/4 c. milk. The result was a decent flavor but very dry puppy. The family ate them so overall, OK but I will continue to look for a more moist puppy recipe. Perhaps buttermilk & more than 1/4 c. of it?

My husband loves hushpuppies, but every time I've tried to make them they've been terrible...until tonight.  I cut the recipe in half and followed it almost as written; I didn't have self-rising flour, so I added 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda to AP flour and added some spices. The batter was too dry, so I added a little bit of buttermilk. It took me a little practice...the first ones I made got way too brown before the insides had cooked, so I reduced the temperature of the oil a little and made the spoonfuls smaller...and PERFECTION!  My husband was in hog-heaven and even though I've never been a huge hushpuppy fan, I have to admit these were really good.  As other reviewers have said, these are rather sweet, so add your sugar accordingly.

It needed an extra egg. Plus some seasoning. Try adding 1 tsp of salt, garlic powder and black pepper in addition to the extra egg and it would be 4.5 stars.

Oh Yea!!  I've been making these for years and friends who said they don't like hush puppies LOVE THESE!  I do add about a teaspoon of milk but the onions do the job keeping them moist.  
Excellent - every single batch!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and moist.  I used 1 c. Marie Callender's already premixed corn meal instead of regular corn meal.  Added 1/2 can of corn, a tad Tabasco, and some premixed seasoning. Fried in canola oil on med hi heat till dark brown so the inside is done.  Came out great.  Thank you.

Without the addition of 1/2 cup of milk, the mixture is like breadcrumbs; no amount of mixing could bring the dry ingredients and the beaten eggs together.  I kept thinking I read the recipe wrong!  The flavor and texture after adding the milk was quite perfect, as far as I am concerned.  I would strongly recommend adding some milk to bring the batter together.  I found the batter impossible to incorporate without milk.

I,m a hushpuppie fanatic ,these where way too dry and sweet.I prefer the southern recipes over the sweet ( I assume ) northern sweet recipe. But gave it a try cause I like to experiment.
 With that being said, I had to thin out this recipe with milk in order to make it the proper consistency. It would have been nothing more than a fried bisquit otherwise. Second, even with that, it was too dry after frying and too sweet for my tastes. Suggest eliminating the sugar, add onion salt 1/2 tsp. and 1 tsp salt

Absolutely DELISH! Only my second time ever making hushpuppies from scratch, and these were much better than the first recipe I tried. The sweetness makes for an adventurous meal when combined with something strong such as fish.

I added salt, pepper, and garlic salt based on other reviews. The taste was great but they were too dense. I will also mince the onions next time for a more even texture.

Too sweet, too much onion, not any salt?? And too dense, not crumbly enough. I think nest time I will decrease flour or omit all together. Tasted ok once I dipped them in horseradish sauce to drown the sweetness.

This was my first time making hush puppies.  I remember them as a child and how yummy they were.  I have never found them as tasty in restaurants and many don't carry them.  I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  They were okay.  I made a double batch so I added 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of whole milk.  Definitely need the liquid.  I added the onions, but next time, I will keep them out and sprinkle powdered sugar on top when they are done.  I may also melt some butter and include that as part of the liquid.  I do think this is a good base recipe, but it needs some work and definitely more liquid than 2 eggs.

They were good but very dry, couldn't get all the ingredients mixed together because the mix was so dry.

This was very easy and very tasty! As some have said, I would cut back the sugar a little. They were gone in seconds at the last fish fry!

These were delicious.  I will be making these often as my whole family enjoyed them.  I followed the recipe but added diced jalepenos and add a little jalepeno juice to the batter to add moisture.

I used fresh eggs and they were a little small so there wasn't enough liquid and I had to add a little milk. I also added a touch of salt. Very good recipe and easy to prepare.

I made these twice, once with onion, once without, and both times they were just hard. The hush puppies I've had are soft and fluffy, these were pretty much inedible because of how hard they were. Guess I'll keep searching for the recipe I lost.

Very good recipe. I'm in SC so I love my puppies sweet. I added a little milk to get it to the consistency i wanted and also I did grate my onion and added extra since i love the onion flavor in them. next time i think i might add corn to this recipe and turn in into a fritter.

These turned out really good.  I didn't have self-rising flour or cornmeal so used some baking powder to help with that.  I did use most of 1 medium-sized onion and I did grate it for the juice.  They were not dry at all and cooked up really fast.  I might, however, cut back a bit on the sugar as they were pretty sweet but that could have been because I used a sweet onion too.  Kids loved them!  Will make again!

I'd never made hushpuppies before and was nervous, but I made these for my parents and they were very good! I did make some changes, though, based on previous reviews.  I halved the recipe but only used two tablespoons of sugar (I'm southern and love sweet cornbread, but not sweet hushpuppies) and that level of sweetness was just right for us.  I also added 1/8 cup of milk to mix everything up, some corn, and salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne to taste.  I cooked them in my deep fryer.  Everyone loved them! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I had no self rising flour so I added 1.5 tsp baking powder and ended up using just enough water to bring the mixture together. Ialso added about 1 tsp seasoned salt. These were light and fluffy and not at all too sweet.  Will make again since these didn't last very long at all.

This is great..my personal preference is a little more moist, and a LOT less sugar next time.  I halved the recipe, and I added about 1/3 of a cup of buttermilk to the dough, and it was still not quite enough. I also cut the sugar to 3tbsp and it was still too sweet; again, all personal preference. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. My only err was that I chopped the onions a little bit to big so some cubed onions in the middle didn't cook all the way. But I still totally love this recipe , thanks.

I work at a facility with residential clients (all boys).  No one knew what hush puppies were when I put them on the menu.  They  poked at them but when they tasted them, they were in 7th heaven.  They have asked for these several times.  They even wanted them as a snack.  Thanks for the recipe.  By the way, I used the 1/4 cup of milk with the existing recipe as suggested by some.

Very delicious! These tasted just like the Hush Puppies you would get at a restaurant. I didn't add as much sugar or onion, though. I also added some salt, but other than that I loved it. Definitely making this recipe again. :]

I made these last night for my family and my parents and they LOVED them.  These were the best I've had, my mom even like them and she is a very picky eater.  I think she could have had them as a meal by themselves.  I served them with fried catfish and fried eggplant.  We rarely eat fried food in my family (maybe once every few weeks) so I enjoyed every bite!

These are the best hush puppies I have ever made.  I did them for a church fish fry and got rave reviews.  I did as the recipe is written for one batch  (did for 125 people) they were great. I then did a smaller batch with japaleno peppers for the ones who like a little spice.  They were just as good.  You can choose the level of spice you want very easily.  I think for some the sugar might be a little much if you like a less sweet batter but it to is easy to modify.  The bottom line is it is a great recipe and is very forgiving if you want to customize it to your own taste.  You think it will be very dry for us who think we have to add buttermilk or some other liquid but it make a very good batter and frys well.

Great flavor! But it would not stay in one ball when I dropped it in the oil. What am I doing wrong?

Sorry...  wasn't a fan.  I added milk and salt but they were bland and not the light, fluffy hush puppy I've had before.

I cut the sugar in half, didn't use self rising cornmeal and i added milk to make the mixing easier.  I got compliments on these and DH said these were the best hushpuppies i have ever made(that includes the kind from the box)

I thought these hush puppies were very good and my family really like them. It was the first time I had ever attempted to cook hush puppies and I think they turned out well. I don't like them that sweet so next time I think i will use 1/4 cup of sugar. I didn't have any self rising flour either so i used all cornmeal and it worked great :)

These were delicious!  Perfect compliment to the spicy coconut grilled shrimp.  I like my cornbread a little sweet though, so if you do not, maybe cut the sugar in half.  Yummy!

Good hush puppies - keep them turning once you drop them in the oil, or they will not flip over and brown on both sides.

These were very tasty.  I didn't follow the instructions exactly as they were spelled out, as I was slightly distracted at the time.  The mixture turned out a little dry to start with but, I added a little milk to get it to the right consistency and they turned out great.

Excellent!!!  So good!!!  I made exactly as written, except I added 1 t baking powder as I had only all-purpose flour.  I could easily eat the entire batch in one sitting!  Were a huge hit with the family.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne to the mixture.  Also used baking powder because I didn't have self rising flour.  I rolled them into balls before dropping into the fryer for a prettier presentation.  Awesome!

These were very nice.  I am based in England, UK and have never tasted these before.  My wife and my little boy loved them.  I served these with Beer Battered Cod Fillets which are on this website.   My next task is to find out what kind of dishes the folks from the US serve these up with.   I did not use self-raising corn meal as I could find it in my local supermarket, I added 1/2 cornflour and increased the self raising flour.  Thanks for the recipe Vicki!!

following the advice of some other reviewers, i cut back on the sugar to about 1/4 cup and added about 2/3 cups of beer. it made for a very smooth and creamy batter but i found it to be a bit bland, so i added 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and 2 tsp of Lawry's season salt. EXCELLENT! a bit spicy, but went great with the catfish i made. I have had problems with hush puppies recipes before but this one is great. SELF-RISING FLOUR AND CORNMEAL IS A MUST!!! they rise beautifully.

I made these hush puppies to go along with a beer battered fish recipe.  These were AMAZING!  They had a little too much sugar, but I liked the sweetness.  Next time I will probably slightly reduce the sugar.

I also used this recipe for our church fish fry.  We had RAVE reviews!  Everyone LOVED the hush puppies.  We used a food processor for the onion that way we didn't need to add any liquid.  We like ours sweet so we used the recipe just like it was written.  They are AWESOME!

This got great reviews from people that will give you the "hard" truth. I followed the recipe except I added fresh chives (3 Tablespoons) and canned niblet corn (3 TBL). I also added chopped jalapenos. One per batch for 8. Make small drops and remove after browning. Enjoy.

Followed some of the advice...grated onion,a little milk. They turned out good but I think if I make these again I will add some additional spices, and jalapenos. A good recipe when you have a hushpuppy craving.

Perfect hush puppies, this is the only recipe I will use from now on. I did chop the onions up very fine and loved the way they came out.

These were perfect as written. My first time making hush puppies and I recieved rave reviews. I wasnt sure if my all purpose flour would work so I used bread flour. I will make these everythime we have seafood.

We made these with fresh caught catfish.  Awesome recipe!  When I talked about "tweaking" the recipe, I was met with why mess with perfect?  Sweet, but great.

Okay,I made them,they were good but the sugar?....eh,I slightly cut down on it and it was still too much,I put in Tony Chachere's when I realized it and I didn't put in enough,next time I make these (if I make them) I'll either cut down some more on the sugar or completely x nay it and put in Tony's and cream style corn like Michelle H. suggested. Sorry Vickie.

These hush puppies were not good. It was very difficult for me to maintain the proper oil temp. and burned some. I didn't care for how dry and crumbly the inside was. The ingredients were easy to assemble but I don't think I will make these again.

I thought this was a great recipie. The only thing I suggest is to us less sugar if you don't like them to sweet. Goes very well with some fried fish

Pretty good.  I just used regular old flour and cornmeal, since I didn't have any self rising on hand.  I also used vidalia onion (it's a sweet onion), and a bit more sugar. I eyeballed the liquid, so couldn't tell you if I used more or less than the recipe called for.

This was a great, simple and quick recipe!  My sister and nieces were in town from KS and everyone loved it.  I did follow the recipe (which is very hard for me!) although I reduced the sugar to 1/3 C and it was the "just right" sweet! Thanks

These were delicious! I did not have self-rising cornmeal or self-rising flour so I added 3 tsp of baking powder and they turned out just fine. Remember to keep them small so that they cook all the way through. Just as the recipe says make them about a teaspoon size.

WOW. I just got home from work where we had a Fish Fry Fundraiser. I had to adjust the recipe for 150 servings. Yes, 150! I received rant and raves all afternoon. Everyone wanted copies of the recipe so they could make them this weekend for their friends and families. I have NEVER been able to successfully make hush puppies. I was terrified after volunteering to make them. But I turned to my favorite recipe site (All Recipes) and evidently found the recipe that saved my life. Thank you so much for sharing this outstanding recipe.

These were wonderful!  I used gluten free flour as well as corn meal and added a teaspoon of baking powder to account for the self rising flour.  These cooked up nice and were absolutly wonderful.  I think I may put chopped jalapeno in the mix next time.  Yummy!

Loved the recipe, the only reason I'm giving it four stars is I don't keep self rising flour or cornmeal in the house and the poster did specify about the milk.  I used 1 cup of each and added 3 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt.  I also added enough milk to get a consistency that was good for me.  Very yummy.  My guests add more hush puppies than etouffee!

I don't know if I did something wrong but they came out very dry and hard. When mixing the batter it was very dry... I don't see how you could drop a spoonful into the oil. I had to form them by rolling them up.

These came out in more of a cake-like texture. Real fluffy. These don't seem as greasy as restaurant hush puppies, which was nice. I will probably make these again.

Very very good and very very easy!  Next time I will only make halft the recipe for our little family of three.  Too many of these little guys is dangerous!  I did have to add a little bit of milk to make the batter moist enough.  Otherwise this recipe needs no changes or additions!  Yum!!!

I love this recipe, the only thing I did differently was add a little milk. Without the milk it was a little too thick, but this is an amazing recipe.

I followed some advice from the reviews to make some slight modifications. First, I grated the onion to use the juices, then mixed everything together. It was a tad dry so I added 1/2 can of creamed corn-which I planned to add some corn anyway. (Next time I'll add more whole corn and some peppers.) They came out great! Made them with Frogmore Stew-from site-and had a down home cooked meal served on newspaper with lots and lots of napkins!! Great time!

Great with some change. I didnt' try it as is but what I did was 1/2 the recipe but with 1/3 onion chopped small, a good handful of chives cut up, a pinch of salt, 1/8C sugar, half a tsp baking powder

I really liked it and would make it again.

I changed 2 things about this recipe. One is I added 1/3 cup + 1/8 cup of buttermilk & took the advice of one other reviewer & added 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 a cup. It's PERFECT!!! The reason why I started with 1/3 cup of buttermilk is because I didn't want to add too much because I wouldn't be able to take it out. I realized that there still wasn't enough, so I added an additional 1/8 cup to it. I loved them & this is the 4th recipe that I've tried. The others didn't even come close. This is hush puppie heaven! 

Thanks for the recipe Vicki! 

They're awesom!

Vicki, my name is Vicky also. My husband and myself loved this hush puppies recipe with one change, I added a little milk like others suggested. They were light and delicious.

Awesome recipe! I made it as directed in the recipe with the exception of adding a little old bay seasoning. My 73 year old father who has never cared for hush puppies said they are the best he's ever tasted and went back for seconds and even thirds! Thanks for the great recipe, it is a keeper and will definately get plenty of use in my home!

I used this recipe because my recipe calls for baking powder and I was out. I still prefer my recipe. But, this wasn't bad and I would make them again.

Everyone raved about these hush puppies. Will make again!! I had to add a little milk to mine. I also made it up ahead of time about an hour and let it get nice and cold. I also added onion and garlic powder to mine since my family likes the extra onion and garlic taste.

This was absolutely delicious! Thanks! This needed a little more than half an egg for 2 servings & a little more oil than ¼ cup for frying. Definitely doesn’t take 40 minutes when cooking for 2 servings. I added a pinch of garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper to taste, and half a pinch of cayenne just before frying.

We LOVE this recipe, we have made it several times and always get requests for more.  We have a bunch of spicy lovers in our family so I added a diced jalapeno and habanero and they are amazing!!

Very, very sweet. Used green onions like Paul Prudhomme does, was tasty. However, these are verrry sweet and you should definitely cut back the sugar by at least half!

First time I've successfully made hush puppies.  This was delicious.  Thick like I thought it should be and no need for milk whatsoever.  I can't imagine adding milk to it.  Wonderful.  Even my 7yo ate them and she NEVER eats hush puppies.  It probably helped that it was sweet, but she gobbled them up.

Well, I've got to say that I was in a hurry when I grabbed this recipe, so I didn't have time to read the other reveiws, and if I had, these might have turned out better.  There wasn't nearly enough liquid, so I had to add some milk, and they turned out very thick and heavy.  I will try again though, and make sure I work the egg in really good.  There were too many good reveiws to count this one out!

I just made these.  Where did I go wrong?  They were so dry, I had to add 2 more eggs.  Should there be milk in them?  Sorry, maybe my tastebuds are different, but even my family said they tasted like catfish bait.  Too much cornmeal.

I made this recipe with green onion instead and added a few tablespoons of milk because there were some feedback that hush puppies were too dry. They turned out good. My husband said they were sweet, but he ate quite a few anyway. I like sweet hush puppies and this recipe suits my taste. Next time, I will try to make this with onion. I will probably decrease the batch size in half because I have a small family and there were too much left over.

These were a big hit with everyone at a fish fry with some good 'ole fried Texas catfish.  Except for my uncle who thought they were a little two sweet and thought they'd be better with some jalapeno peppers chopped in the batter. He was the only one!  I thought they were very easy to make and I didn't use self rising flour or cornmeal and they turned out great.  The center was quite dense I thought, but no one seemed to mind at all.  This is a keeper.

WOW - these were AMAZING!!  My husband just caught some fresh fish and 
wanted some hush puppies.  I am so glad I picked this recipe.  It was excellent!
Although, I must have made them larger than the recipe intended, because it
didn't make as many as it said.  They turned out perfect anyway.  I had to 
make a second batch....my kids loved them too.  Thanks!!
