If you like dumplin's and blueberries you'll LOVE this! I added juice from 1/2 a lemon and after cooking let the biscuits stand for about 10 mins before serving so the juice could thicken. The left over was great in blueberry triffle the next day.

Despite the yummy aroma as the Flummery cooking, my family was not sold. I am still giving it four stars because I thought it was tasty and I enjoyed making it.

I really didn't care for this recipe, to me it wasn't one of those deserts you would want to have seconds or even make again.  Although it was fun making it and the smell was great it just wasn't all that tasty.

This tasted like an amazing blueberry cobbler.  My husband and all 4 kids (10 years down to 2 years old) loved it!  I did make it in a Le Creuset dutch oven on the stove top which may be why the dumpling part turned out so well (just like a very good biscuit).  I also cooked the dumplings an extra 5 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.
