This was great. The only thing I added was chives. Next time I think I will add walnuts as well.

Wow, can't say enough good things about this salmon salad.  I had some leftover Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon fillet in the fridge, so I used that instead of the canned salmon.  The golden raisins give it a little sweetness and the apple a bit of crunch, and both really bring this to life and make it unique.  If you're not a raisin lover, I could see dried cranberries working equally well, maybe even better.  Winner recipe seajillian, thanks for a new favorite!

This was delicious....We had it on Rye Wasa crackers. I added some dill to give it a little more flavor to go with the Rye and some avocado.

Loved this! Adore salmon but never used canned for anything but patties. This salad was delicious and has so many variation possibilities...I can't wait to do it again!
