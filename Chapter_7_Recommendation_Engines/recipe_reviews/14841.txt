I used this recipe as a main course for dinner and it was great!  The only change I made was to saute sliced mushrooms with the garlic and basil. Served with a salad, it was perfect for a meatless meal.

This recipe couldn't be easier - I bought pepperoni and mozzerella stuffed tortellini and prepared everything hours before the party.  I served it warm, but people ate them long after they had cooled.

Next time I make these, I will present them better - the dish needed color...

My husband and I really did enjoy this dish.  It is very simple to make and really is a simple and tasty dish. Very good flavor without making it too strong of a sauce. I make with a seafood dinner and it was just the perfect compliment. Thanks for the post.

I made this as an appetizer for Christmas Day and my family loved it!  It was easy to make and quite delicious.  I used tri-color tortellini and it looked very nice.

I will definately make this again.  It's not only good as an appetizer but I also think it would make a great side dish for parties.

I make a soup version of this recipe using more chicken broth, a handful of fresh baby spinach and green onion and a container of pesto from Trader Joes.  It is divine on a crisp fall day ...

These were a big hit at the last party I attended, they were gone quickly!  I did add the sauce to the cooked tortelli when I got to my destination as I found if you pre-mix it gets a little dry, but still not bad!

Thank you!

I have made this recipe many times since getting it from this website.  I am always asked to bring it to parties.  Tastes wonderful either hot or cold. Thanks for a great recipe.

Used this with lunch...we found them to be pretty good. Different than your meat sauce tortellini. I didn't change a thing about this recipe and wouldn't if I made this again. I wonder if this could be turned into a main dish with some steamed veggies? Thanks Helen!

I added fresh mushrooms and made as an entree!! It was magnifico....How many individual tortellini's were considered a serving?  4 grams of fat would be excellent but that seems like a dream.

I made this as a main dish for dinner by adding chicken. I sauteed the cubed chicken breasts in the butter, added the garlic (a little extra because we LOVE garlic), basil and added oregano and dash of pepper. Instead of using the broth to boil the tortellini in, i just added boullion granules to the boiling water. We all loved it, except my son, who doesn't like cheese. :( This was super easy for a quick weeknight supper.

My 14 year old son says this is AWESOME! We used this as a main meal and it was very good. The only thing we did different was, we didn't add as much Basil. We used 1 1/2 teaspoon. 2 just sounded like to much. We will make this again!

I used spinach-cheese tortellini. I used only the broth, added canned navy beans, onions and chopped sauted garlic. I served this as a main meal soup at a gathering and it was a hit!

I didn't like this at all.  I don't think it's bland, because there is quite a bit of basil and garlic.  But the broth with the cornstarch makes a gel-like sauce that was very unappetizing, to put it nicely.  There are much better choices for tortellini.

These were bland, and it definitely needs some doctoring up. None of my coworkers cared for these, and unfortunately neither did I. Sorry, but thanks for the post.

ONE WORD: YUM!
I decided to turn this into a main dish. I followed the recipe exactly, then I added in grilled chicken that I grilled with basic seasoning salt and freshly ground pepper. It was VERY filling as a main dish, and super easy to make. This is not something I'd personally eat everyday, but something I'll keep in my recipe book for a few times a year.

This was not great. Pretty bland. But since we didn't want it to go to waste, I chopped up some sundried tomatoes in oil, and wow what a difference. Actually made the meal into something pretty good. We will make this again with the necessary changes. Maybe some red pepper flakes next time too!

I did not like the taste of the sauce.  It was too garlicky and buttery, even though I halved the amount of butter.  Cooking the tortellini in the broth was an interesting touch though.

This was VERY bland! The only reason it got 3 stars is because my 1 1/2 year old son ate alot of it.  I didnt think it was too salty like others said but it was just bland.

This is okay.  I wouldn't serve it at a party though.  I actually ended up rinsing the tortellini's off and eating them plain rather than throwing them away.

Made it with rainbow tortellini, which took care of the presentation/need for color. It was delicious, made as written. My husband kept eating it because it "tastes so good," rather than because he was hungry (we'll keep working on that). Put it out hot during a football game and it was great for snacking even after it cooled. No drippy or runny sauce, just great flavor - perfect on toothpicks.

Yummy and easy! I also served it as an entree with garlic bread, very good. If I wanted meat it would be easy to substitute beef tortellini instead. I did add some onion when I sauteed the garlic and basil. I'd also suggest if you do it as an entree, wait and sprinkle cheese on each serving instead of mixing it in.

This was a huge hit at a recent party. I had never worked with cornstarch before- it was weird, it clumped alot! The dish itself did not have a ton of flavor, so I added crushed red pepper, lemon juice, and italian seasoning. I would definitely make it again!

Sorry, this was nothing but thickened chicken broth with dry basil in it. In my opinion, it neither tasted good, nor looked appetizing.  Read the other reviews... most of the people that liked it did NOT follow the recipe. I'm sure I would have enjoyed plain-water cooked tortellini tossed with butter and Parmesan far more.

It turned out great.  I let the butter brown just a bit for more body.  I suggest you either double the gravy or halve the tortellini.

Quite yummy! To turn it into a main dish, I added sliced mushrooms and green onions, and chopped fresh spinach and rotisserie chicken. Also added a splash of cream. The reason I'm not rating this 5* is that the dried basil was a little off for me. Either it needed a touch less, or fresh basil would probably be much better. Also needed salt and pepper to taste.

This was excellent my husband was asking for more. Now my picking son didn't like the cheese sauce so I heated up a small portion of red sauce and poured it over his and he liked that a lot. I wouldn't and didn't change a thing and it was quick and very very good. ty for sharing.

My family of eight loved this.  It's requested at least once a week.  The only change I made is by cooking it in water rather than chicken broth.  Absolutely yummy!

I totally agree that this was distateful.  First of all, it was way to salty.  My husband who puts salt on everything could not even eat.  It's a waste to use the chicken broth to cook the tortellini and unnecessary.  It didn't add any great flavor and that's probably where a lot of the salt came from.  The sauce was very sticky and looked like thick glue.  To salvage it we added at least a cup of milk to make it more creamy like an alfredo sauce and to dilute the saltiness.  Would not make this again.  It sounded good but very disappointing.

Just following the recipe and not adding anything to it results in a dull, distasteful dish. The sauce was more sticky than creamy. Rather disappointed. I used low sodium chicken broth and still thought it was too salty. I think it's best to start from scratch using a different recipe.

This recipe was good except that it was too salty.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will probably try making it again with low sodium chicken broth.  Another review sauted mushrooms with the garlic which also sounds good.

We loved this dish.  This is the first review I've written and thought this dish was worthy.  I made as a main dish and added some prochuttio ham to the garlic and I used fresh basil a friend gave us the day before.  We like romano cheese way better than parmesan so I made that change too. I used the 28 oz package of 7 cheese tortellini from CostCo (2 28 oz packaged as one).  My 19 year old even sat down to dinner with us which is a rarity.  Can't wait to use the other package and have this dish again.

Awesome recipe.  I served them as a side dish, not appetizer, and everyone loved them.  Delicious!
