Really like this recipe. It is very simple and straight forward. I've made it twice now, and these scones are excellent. I use fresh blueberries instead of frozen, and they turn out great. Instead of making 10 scones I make 8 in a batch. I think next time though I might use slightly less than a cup of blueberries. It seemed like there was a ton of blueberries in there for a cup. We'll see. But great recipe!

These are easy to make with ingredients readily available in my kitchen.  Exactly the size, taste and texture I was looking for.  Very tasty! I didnt change a thing except I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen.

They turned out amazing! We added some lemon juice and lemon zest for some lemon flavor and it made them extra good.
