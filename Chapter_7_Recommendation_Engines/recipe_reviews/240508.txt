A good versatile seasoning that can be adjusted to lower the sodium. You can put this on just about anything.

This worked perfectly in a recipe that called for adobe seasoning. It is nice to be able to adjust the flavours to our liking. Thank you PR Punisher for the recipe.

I love this seasoning mixture!  Thank you, PR Punisher!  I wanted to make my own adobo so I wouldn't have to buy the msg-laced store version, and this made that possible.  I do add extra turmeric to mine when I make it, but this recipe was exactly what I was looking for.

At first, I didn't have turmeric, so I subbed with cumin which is widely used in Puertorican cooking. It worked really well! Now that I have turmeric, I use it for this recipe and add 1 tsp powdered onion as well. I have also replaced the garlic for a garlic and parsley blend when it is cheaper. Every time the recipe is amazing. Now I can make it at home since most of the spices are staples in my spice rack.

Loved it, used it recently with a batch of grilled chicken and Puerto Rican inspired beans and rice, arroz con habichuelas.

It becomes a staple in my pantry now. I used it when I made the Cuban Ropa Vieja dish!

This is a delightful seasoning, and really surprised me when I discovered that while it has a wonderful flavor it didn't pack the "spicy punch" I was concerned about. I will admit that I had to substitute ground cumin in place of the turmeric. But I am glad that I have extra now for future usage.

Thank you, I bought my first cast iron skillet and made cod that needed Adobo seasonings. Turn out wonderful.  Even my picky husband liked it.

I use a little different ratio; "double" each ingredient as you progress:  0.5 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp oregano, 2 tsp black pepper, (4 tsp salt), and 8 tsp (3 Tbsp) garlic. Recently I began to omit the salt for health reasons, as it can always be added at the table if needed.
