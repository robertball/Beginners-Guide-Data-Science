Wonderful comfort food.  My only complaint would be that it was a little on the bland side.  I added some thyme and sage to the broth, and it turned out just fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made.  Very easy to prepare even though I have never made dumplings before.  My 2 year old loved it as well as my picky brother in law.

The dumplings are good. Not like my Great Grandfathers, But good. Did not taste the sour cream and is a good alternative to shortening or lard. I added two bay leaves to the broth, YUM!!!

This was about as good as one could possibly ask for in a low fat chicken and dumplings recipe.  The wife and I both loved it.

As for the amount of water used, I filled an 8 quart pot about half way up with water then added the chicken, celery, onion and some poultry seasoning after it came to a boil.  That worked very well.

Decent recipe but with a few holes.  I wasn't sure how much water to simmer the chicken in or when to put in the onion.  I used the directions for the bullion (1 cube for 1 cup of water) but was disappointed with how salty the finished result was.

I didn't like the flavor the sour cream gave the dumplings.  However, overall, it was ok.

Good recipe. I used less H2O and added sage and poultry seasoning to the broth as one review suggested. I also used whole wheat flour and added 1 cup of sliced carrots for the kiddos...the family enjoyed the meal! Thanks!

Oh my! I am a southern girl who loves chicken and dumplings. Now that I am on my own, I crave them sometimes and don't have mom or granny to make them. This was sooo super easy (easy enough for a weeknight!) and delicious. I know granny spent all day on hers, but why if I can make them any night of the week? Plus, I had EVERYTHING on hand. I used fat free sour cream. And, I measured out how much water I put in my pot. My pot took about 10-11 cups. So, I added 10-11 bouillon cubes. After the bouillon dissolved, I used 1/2 c of that for my dumplings. I used the seasonings to taste, but with all the chicken bouillon, it didn't take much of everything. I also added a little garlic powder, used celery seed instead of celery, and used a little thyme.  Since I don't like mine too thick, I made 1/2 of the cornstach mixture, but only used 1/4-1/2 of it. They definitely thicken even more on cooling, and stay a little thick after reheating the next day. Thanks so much for making a delicious childhood favorite a possibility for a busy, working, student far from home!!

This is a good recipe to start with, but it does need a little tweaking. I added peas and carrots, but I wish I'd added some garlic. I will next time. I found the dough to be a little sticky. I had to work a good amount of flour into it to be able to pat it out and cut it. The directions don't say how thick to roll the dough. I rolled mine to about 1/4 inch. These remind me more of homemade noodles than dumplings, though. Next time I will cut the liquid to 1/4 cup and roll them thinner. Thanks for a good base recipe (that doesn't use cream of something soup...) :)

Isn't there an error in this recipe? I expected it to have baking powder in the biscuit dough. The dumplings were heavy without it. I think it should be added in.

I upmost agree that it is nice to find this recipe that does not include condensed soup or anything of the sort... Trying to find a recipe as close to my grandmother as possible and this is it! Thank you for sharing!!

This recipe was awesome!  I had never made homemade chicken and dumplings before, and this recipe was easy, and wonderful!

I did have a couple of problems that I had to change though.  For the dumplings, 2 cups of flour was not enough, the dough was way to sticky.  I had to add an extra cup.  Also, I used roughly 10 cups of water, and 8 buillon cubes instead of 4.  I didn't use parsley, I used thyme and added garlic powder as well.  In the end when I thickened it, I used milk instead of water.  

My husband and I both loved it, I will definitely make this recipe again.

I should have paid more attention to the previous review and added baking powder to the dumpling mix.  Dumplings were chewy blobs.  I wanted to follow the recipe as it was written.  My only change was browning the chicken pieces in the pot first to add a little extra flavor.  I need to find a recipe that does not call for a mix as I am not in the States & don't have access to most premade mixes & soups.  Oh well.

A fantastic "down home" chicken and dumplings recipe that's easy enough for a beginner!  At the suggestion of other reviews, I added a quarter teaspoon of sage and thyme and omitted the parsley... it turned out perfectly!

I had turkey in the freezer, I used that instead  of chicken.  I also added carrot and peas.  I modified the dumplings a bit, by adding fresh parsley and baking powder.  This was delish!

Agree with other posts - dumplings were thick and rubbery.  The broth was bland and requires a whole lot of something else.  Also, the directions were inconsistent and confusing.

I added spice and baking powder to the dumplings, but they were still too thick and rubbery.  The flavor of the broth was good (although I added cayanne pepper, seasoning salt, and carrots), but I MUST continue looking for a better recipe for the dumplings, which were OK, edible, but disappointing.

This turned out pretty good - the dumplings were great (love me some flat dumplings!) I did add carrots and some thyme. I also used homemade stock instead of bullion that was in my freezer and needed to be used up. Thanks for the dumplings!

This is as good, if not better, than the same-named dish a that barrel place!!  

My kids had a great time making the dumplings, which they cut with a pizza cutter.  I use whole chicken breast tenderloins, and I cut down the amount of cornstarch.  And when the kids don't want the celery & onions IN the final dish-I just cook the chicken with those things cut in half so they can be fished out easily before adding the dumplings.

I think this recipe has the best ingredients for a light and fluffy dumpling. The dough should be just past the sticky stage (does that make sense?) and should feel soft. I hand shred my chicken and make short strips of dumplings. Remember, you need a lot of salt and pepper to make this dish, but I know some Louisiana folks who add some creole seasoning for some kick!

I have tried to make chicken and dumplings a million times and the dumplings always tasted like a clump of dough. This recipe has been a Godsend! I highly reccomend this recipe if you have trouble with dumplings.

When I was growing up, chicken and dumplings was my favorite dish at school - but instead of actual dumplings, they had pasta noodles. Unfortunately, this experience has colored my opinion of this soup. While I absolutely thrilled with how the soup turned out, I wasn't too thrilled with the dumpling portion of it - it was too bland for my taste.

I followed the recipe...the chicken was great....the dumplings were horrible. They didn't "fluff" up at all....actually they became dough bricks that sunk to the bottom. I recommend the chicken portion..although I did add fresh garlic for flavor....the dumplings were hard and heavy. I will make the chicken part again, but will use a different dumpling recipe.

Was a great dish. Also added time and sage for flavor. My new âgo toâ chicken soup recipe.

The dumplings came out dense with this recipe, I feel like it needed baking soda to make them light and fluffy. Otherwise itâs an ok starter recipe.

As a lot of people have already said, this is a great "from scratch" recipe. The only problem I had was the dumplings were VERY heavy, not light and fluffy at all. However, I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, not sure how much that would change the consistency of the dumplings. I added carrots, sage, poultry seasoning, and garlic to the soup. Delicious! Just have to figure out how to get light and fluffy dumplings.

The soup was fine-I added things to liven it up, but sorry to say that the dumplings were awful - gluey and bland (and I followed the recipe to the T). I picked them all out and salvaged the meal that way  . :-(

I made a couple of changes. I put 2 onions, half stalk celery and garlic cloves in cheese cloth and tied with kitchen string and placed in the pot with the water and chicken to season.  I also added one 32 ounce box of chicken broth to the water once the chicken was almost cooked to add more flavor to the broth.  No need to strain. When chicken is done simply remove flavor packet and discard. I substituted sour cream with buttermilk to make the dumplings more southern.

A great comfort food meal! Thank you for a chicken and dumpling recipe like my grandma made!! I hate cream of anything soup, so this recipe was great. I did add thyme and sage. I probably added more cornstarch because I didn't know how much water to start with. Delicious!!
