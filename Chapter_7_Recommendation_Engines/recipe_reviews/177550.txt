Tthe recipe, as listed, is way to much for the two pastry sheets UNLESS you roll them out to maybe a third more space.  Otherwise, you need three sheets to use all of the filling as described.

I would increase the amount of cinnamon to 1Â½ teaspoons, the standard for a cup of packed brown sugar,  so that the sugar does not overwhelm the cinnamon.

Finally, the baking time is inadequate-30 to 35 minutes at 375 will produce the golden brown and sufficiently heat the sugar to produce caramelization.

Apart from all these issues, the end result is delicious.

Delicious and easy to make!  My husband LOVES raisin sticky buns and he said these were as good as the Amish ones we buy at the farm market.   Only problem was in the removal of the bun from the baking liners.  I did this right from the oven and still lost some of the pastry with the liner.  The longer I waited the more pastry lost.   Thinking about baking it in a pan next time like regular cinnamon buns.

I neede to use up some cinnamon sugar I have on hand as well as the last piece of puff pastry I have sitting in my freezer. This recipe was perfect for that! 5 stars for ease of prep and makes for a great little snack!
