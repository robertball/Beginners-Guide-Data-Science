We really liked this recipe.  Was a tad hot for my wife but she loved it.  We let it marinated for just about 5 hours.  Cooked on gas grill over direct heat, about 450 degrees.   I cooked about 4 minutes per side and it was perfectly done.

I love the glaze, it was worth the extra effort to boil down the marinade to make it thick.   

I would like to try this on lamb.

UPDATE: 7/12/18

Made this again and this time I cut all the spices in 1/2 because my wife can not handle spicy foods very well.  I also increased the honey a little.  I felt the flavor did not suffer and this time I could taste the root beer.  

I like my food spicy so I added chipotle on my after cooking.  I think it taste about the same as when added to the marinade.   I made the glaze again and I do think it is worth extra time/effort.

Next time I would let it marinate longer to see if that brought out more of the flavor.
