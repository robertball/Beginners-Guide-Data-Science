It's really good but a lot of avocado. I used half the recommended amount and I put it over pasta and it was great.

This is really good. I made it as a side dish served next to Lemon Garlic Talapia. I served it over fresh green beans and it was good a little thicker then i thought it would be. I was expecting more of a sauce but it was still good!

Original and refreshing way to make butterfly shrimp! Go easy on the lemon and add a bit of white wine to make a reduction in the pan. Highly recommended.

I made this recipe for my family along with stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms were a hit but no one liked the prawns. Unfortunately I will not be making this recipe again.

We loved this. We used a pound of shrimp and served it over 16 oz. thin spaghetti (lightly coated in olive oil.) I felt like there was definitely enough sauce without changing the recipe. For our family it served 4. The interesting thing is- it really doesn't taste like avocado. But it's very good!

I made this as an entree for Christmas lunch exactly as given in the recipe. I was intrigued by the idea of warm cooked avocado! The dish on it's own is interesting the flavor of the avocado came through just fine although there was a tad too much avocado to prawns ratio. I feel it does need to be served over pasta or perhaps brown rice to cut the richness. All in all a very novel and interesting dish.

this was very good very fresh flavour. I did however tweak it a bit to make the sauce a bit more pastier and smoother. but it was a hit and will definately be making this again.

The warm avocado fascinated me so I had to try it. The shrimp sort of got lost in the sauce the first time I made this and we thought the sauce was too thick. The second time I steamed my shrimp as I normally do and dipped them in the sauce which I thinned with a bit of dry white wine. I didn't measure just added until the texture was right. Don't be afraid this is really good!
