EASY & TASTY. My family loved it. Kid-friendly. Used a different brand of pasta sauce. Will make again and again.

I had a similar recipe.  Add Italian seasoning to the spaghetti mixture and meat to the sauce.  Or, put sliced pepperoni on top over cheese.  If you've got carnivores like I do, they will love it.

i found this absoutely wonderful way to use left over spaghetti sauce or for just for fun.  I used our left over Italian sauce and also added cheddar cheese with the mozzarella cheese.  I added some pepperoni below the cheeses and a lil more seasoning than reciped called for. I am not much of a cook, but this came out wonderful. Will definately do again  :)

Pretty good. Followed the recipe exactly with adding a few things. Added pepperoni, mushrooms and olives between the sauce and cheese. It was easy to make and my daughter loved it. Next time I think that I will use a little less sauce.

This was so easy to make and turned out very well!  I topped mine with pepperoni, olives and some cut up ham lunch meat.  I added some extra cheese to the top.  It is a very kid friendly dish!
