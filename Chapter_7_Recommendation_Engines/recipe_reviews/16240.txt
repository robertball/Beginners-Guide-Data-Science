Wow! So easy and yet so good! This definitely is a favorite at every BBQ meal. Other than adding a bit of molasses and cuttinb back a little on the brown sugar I wouldn't change a thing. This is a great way to take a regular 'ol can of baked beans and turn them into something special without a lot of effort!

I cooked this for a BBQ and all night long everyone was raving on how good these beans were. I did exactly what the recipe said except I added a little cider vinegar.
I LOVE IT!! Thanks!

These were good I would cut back the sugar theyre pretty sweet I did use a big sweet onion in this since my husband is an onion freak. Good the next day for beanie weenies for lunch.
