I changed the method a bit because I cooked the meat, onions and carrots in the crockpot with a can of beef broth (5 hours on high or 10 on low). I also added some jalapeños to the meat because we like everything spicy. Mashed potatoes to go with it. The gravy was yum! The meat fell apart. Will definitely do this again!

Wow!  This was amazing!  I basically followed the cooking instructions, except after searing the meat, I put it into a crock pot on a bed of carrots, onion and celery with a 1/2 cup of beef broth.  5 hours on high.  The gravy was spot on.  Outstanding!!!!

Fast and easy recipe. I didnt use zucchini, and the potatoes and carrots took a little longer then 40 minutes. The sour cream and dill gravy was amazing!

I made this for our New Year’s dinner. It turned out beautifully, better than expected. I used onions and carrots, no potatoes, however,  I served it with homemade pierogies from Ohio, a Christmas gift from my stepdaughter, and red cabbage.  I am half Polish which made this meal especially nice and reminded me of meals my mother would prepare.

I used thyme instead of dill (not a fan) and it was the very best roast I've ever made!  We were so tired of pot roast in the crock pot, and this stove-top simmered roast was awesome.  The gravy portion of the instructions wasn't as complicated as this...I just added the sour cream to the pot and mixed it and it was done.

We loved this recipe! I added an onion with the vegetables and left out the zucchini. The sour cream dill gravy was wonderful! I will definitely make this roast again!

I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes but otherwise followed directions as listed but cooked in slow cooker instead of on stove top. It turned out delicious.

My family loved this recipe. I will definitely make it again. I made a few minor changes.  Just added some other spices and increased the amount of sour cream.

the gravy was quite bland.  I added onions, Scallions, chives and garlic to give it some flavor.  It's going to be an experiment if I make it again.

Delicious, I made the recipe as stated except that I did not have zucchini. I didn’t substitute anything for the zucchini and I must say I don’t think I missed it. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will make again for sure.

I really like this easy pot roast. Don’t worry about the vinegar it adds to the flavour. The sour cream is amazing in the sauce.
