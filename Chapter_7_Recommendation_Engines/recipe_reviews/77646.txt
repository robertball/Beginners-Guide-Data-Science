I've used this recipe for many years.  The dry crumbly dough problem is easily solved by adding additional water, a teaspoon or so at a time.  The type of flour used, as well as the method used to measure the flour, play a role in how much water will be needed.  Scooping the flour out of the bag and leveling is not the same as spooning the flour into the measuring cup, as scooping tends to pack the flour into the cup and you will wind up with more flour than you would if you spoon and level.  Thus you will need more water.  The version of the recipe that I have says 5 - 7 tablespoons of cold water which takes into consideration the varying differences that may arise with flour type/brand and measuring technique.

Easy, and pretty good pie crust.  I halved the recipe and went from there.  For people who believe there is too little water; just be aware that since flour absorbs humidity, sometimes you need more water or less depending on the humidity of where you live/what your weather is like.  That's why bread recipes sometimes need more or less flour added and that's why this recipe is going to need more or less liquid depending on where you live.  I just kept adding tablespoons of water until I got a nice, smooth ball of crust.  This is flaky, and flavorful if you use butter flavored Crisco like I did.  It was great with the Rosemary and Tomato Tart I made it for.  Thanks for the recipe!

Crisco's pastry has been my "go to" recipe for years. So, I just looked this up as a reminder of the ingredients & amounts since I'm traveling & don't have my cookbook with me. That being said, this recipe on Allrecipes is missing some important details. It jumps from just having made the dough & dividing in -- to placing the rolled dough into the pie plate. It totally skips over how thick to roll the dough for pie crust. BTW: I never make this by hand. I use the food processor and "pulse" in the ingredients, in order, until I get a nice dough ball. Then roll out to 1/8-inch thick. Happy baking!

My FIRST homemade piecrust!  It was my first Thanksgiving as a married lady and I thought I'd make everything from scratch (figured it would make for good stories down the road, haha)

Everyone was very impressed with the flavor (I used butter flavored Crisco sticks) and texture of my pie crust, the only catch was I had a deep dish pan (Didn't know that) so my crust was a little short for the dish. Next time I'll know that the deepdish double crust recipe is:

DEEP DISH DOUBLE CRUST
•2 2/3 cups Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour
•1 teaspoon salt
•1 stick well-chilled Crisco® Baking Sticks All-Vegetable Shortening
• OR 1 cup well-chilled Crisco® All-Vegetable Shortening
•6 to 10 tablespoons ice cold water

This is wonderful!  I've been using this Crisco recipe for many, many years & am not disappointed.  It makes a flaky crust that is very easy.  I keep my Crisco in the refrigerator (other shortenings do not come out as well for me.) so it is good & cold.  The weather & brand of flour can determine the amount of ice water used.  
Start with 2 tble of the ice water, mix with a fork & add additional until it comes together.  I also make it into a disk, wrap in Saran Wrap & chill for 20-30 minutes.  I often use chilled butter-flavored Crisco for a buttery taste. If your crust is crumbly, you must add additonal ice water, a few drops at a time.  Much better than the packaged stuff.

I have been using this recipe for over 25 years and makes the BEST pie crust ever, as with everything you have to practice to make good pie crust. People who say is waste of good ingredients probably don't make it but once a year and should be happy with that frozen or package stuff (which isn't worth the time or money).

Yes, it needed more water than the recipe states...add more slowly until desired dough texture is met.  I thought it best to jump in with my hands at some point because a dough ball just wasn't coming together with "fork tossing" as stated in #1 above.  It rolled out easily, tasted good and was perfect color and thickness for a 9" deep dish crust with no top.   I filled it with freezer peach pie filling from this site and topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  It was delish.

I used Country Crock light instead of shortening because I don't buy shortening. My crust turned out great. Also, to keep from being crumbly, I kneeded the crust with my hands and rolled out on flour. Hope these tips help you!

This has been my go-to pie crust recipe since I started baking as a teenager.  A few tweeks my mom taught me and its perfect.  I use ice water and add 2 tbsp vinegar to it.  I start with 3 tbsp water, tossing it ever so lightly and add 2 more.  The trick is to toss as lightly and as little as possible. These are not a waste of ingredients, you just need practice.

Okay I too have used this recipe for years.  And over the years I have noticed a change in the crisco.- I can no longer immediately use the dough.  If you try to work this immediately after making - I find it is very soft and brittle and literally will fall apart.  Solution - make the dough first, place it in the fridge while you prep your filling - or at least a half hour.  Then it works very well.  My other trick is to use milk instead of water which makes it even more flaky.   I have never had an issue since making theses little changes and the crust is great!

I've used this pie crust recipe for decades and everybody loves my pies. I put an ice cube in the water to make sure it's really cold. I'm going to follow the suggestion of Beadanurse and use the food processor on the "pulse" setting since I'm making many pies this season!

The texture was great but it was a little too salty. In the future I'll use 1/2 tsp. I scooped the flour into the measuring cup with a spoon and still needed to add more crisco FYI.

This is the pie crust my mother always used - and her mother too. The trick is to always use Crisco, and not some other brand and to use ice water. You will definitely need more water than the recipe calls for, but you know it's enough when you can form a ball. Roll it out on a floured counter or board and roll it over the rolling pin to place in the pin pan. It has an excellent flaky texture with minimal shrinkage. Sometimes I replace some of the Crisco with butter (not margarine) for a different taste.

This recipe is great! Like keystitchery I have used this recipe for over 35 years.If you are problems, try these tips. Use ice water to mix. I put ice cubes in my water, spoon it in to flour mixture. You can even refrigerate the pie dough before you roll it out. It is a soft dough and you can work it easily if you roll it out between two sheets of wax paper. I flour my wax paper place dough on to it. Flour top of the dough and top with wax paper and roll to right size. Pull top sheet off and lift from under wax paper and flip into pie pan, Pull wax paper off. Fill and crimp edges. This recipe pinches to reseal a gap easily. Hope this helps.

People who know me, know that although I love baking, I suck at making pie crusts.  My husband and I had purchased a large quantity of apples from the farmers market and spent a Saturday in the kitchen making pies.  We started with a "no-fail" recipe I'd had for years and kept using...then promptly decided it was that recipe that caused me to think I couldn't make crusts!  LOL  We made one pie with it, then on the computer I went to look for another.  And this is it!  It comes together easy, rolls out wonderfully and is very flaky.  We have given away about half the pies to family members and though they do give the pie as a whole a great rating, they rave about the crust.  Look no further, this is an excellent pie crust recipe - even for beginners or those of us who "can't" make crusts!

Had to add too much water.  And it's nothing special as pie crusts go.  The "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" is much better.

A great classic. The only variation I make, is that I use half butter and half Crisco. PERFECTO!

I love this recipe. My family can tell the difference between this and frozen pie crust. Crisco wins hands down.

This is a great recipe. If it doesn't work for you, you should make sure you add the correct ingredients and patience.  Cooking is a Science.

Used this recipe for years. Found out the trick was to use the least amount of water as possible. It takes awhile to figure out just the right amount of water for the flour that you use. I always need to knead my dough once or twice since I use very little water.

was a little crumbly, but was great! just what i want in a pie crust.  I will try another spoon of water next time.  I also put the flour and salt in the freezer and used ice water, that tip was my granny's, so i'm sure there's a reason for it.

I found that I had to use 7 tablespoons of cold water, and that this recipe makes only one and a half pie crusts. It was otherwise a perfect recipe, and I love it. The dough is smooth and tender, not crumbly like other recipes with butter.
