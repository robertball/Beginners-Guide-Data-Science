Added thyme and a bay leaf.  I didn’t have lemon juice so i substituted a splash of apple cider vinegar.  Is very good on a cold autumn day!  Will make again with lemon juice as directed.

Not bad, it needed a lot more liquid than called for in the recipe though

9.8.17  I must say that I love how this recipe breaks down nutritionally.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but it turned out waaaaay too thick and I ended up adding a bunch more chicken broth and a bit more water.  But that’s OK, it ended up tasting pretty darn good.  I enjoyed the addition of the basmati rice, and that little bit of fresh lemon juice really brightened the flavor.
