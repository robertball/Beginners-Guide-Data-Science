This recipe was very good and fast to make...here are a few suggestions:
1. Beware of left over kernels from microwave popcorn, they definitely can hurt a tooth. Popping your own popcorn on the stove prevents this and is just as fast.
2. Put a couple cubes of caramel in the marshmellow sauce, this really makes a diffence! I did one sauce with and one without...the caramels add something that was lacking.
3. For a more vibrant orange use 4 drops of red and 5 drops of yellow.
4. Add few loose marshmellows to the popcorn mixture.
5. To evenly distribute the candy corn and peanuts, pour them ontop of the popcorn and then pour the sauce.

TIP:   put popcorn in a brown paper  lunch bag (no oil necessary) and microwave it. This is healthier than the chemical kind you buy. It is also easier than shaking a pan on the stove.  
Once popped, Tear a small hole in one corner of the brown bag and shake your popcorn over the trash can to get the unpopped kernels to fall out.

This recipe is great!  It's very fun for kids and adults.  If you buy bagged popcorn do not buy really buttery popcorn.  This recipe adds butter to the mixture - you don't want to over do it.  The salty and sweet mix together very well.  If you don't follow the recipe you won't get a 5 star result.  Hope this helps!  Thanks for the recipe.  The kids at Day Care Loved them!

Excellent and a great way to use up candy corn. I couldn't stop eating these! Made these last night and added in roasted peanuts and m&m's. I only used 1/4 cup of butter instead as well. And decided to insert pretzel sticks instead and wraped these nicely in little baggies.

Oh, to be the first review will less than a five! I used about 6Â½ cups of popcorn and I omitted the peanuts and candy corn (I wanted it to be a little LESS bad for us). I did use the licorice, and it took a lot more yellow food colouring to get orange. The only problem I had was that there was way too much butter. Next time, I would use half as much because I ended up with a pool of it separating from the marshmallow after melting and mixing them together. It was fun, though, and we certainly don't regret trying the recipe! I will try it again with a few more changes, and maybe I'll add some Rice Krispies or corn flakes in with the popcorn. Thanks for sharing, Aleta. :)

This is a great recipe for classroom treats. My kids loved helping to make them and everyone ate them right up.  I  added a leaf to the pumpkin, by dying some extra popcorn green and placing one at the base of each stem, made them even cuter!  I also used a thick pretzel stick for the stem instead of licorice.

This was fun & the kids loved how they turned out....I used plain as can be popcorn and followed the recipe exactly and I have to agree with "Duckball" and say that it was way too buttery. Because of all the butter, these ended up not very sweet at all, and so soft that the licorice would not stay in place. Other than that it was overall a good recipe. I will try this recipe again, with a few changes.

Thank you for such an easy, fun and very creative recipe! I am always on the hunt for cute recipe ideas like this one!  I used Wilton's  orange concentrated paste instead of the food colouring drops.  I didn't add any peanuts (these are going to a peanut free school zone) but instead I added 1C of marshmallows w/ the candy corn and stirred them in.  (They didn't melt.  So there is whole mini-marshmallows in every bite) I used green apple flavoured licorice for the stems. I only got 10 pumpkins out of this recipe.  THX

I doubled the recipe and it came out perfect! I followed the instructions exactly except I omited the stems (I instead individually wrapped them in cellophane and tied with black ribbons). Thanks for posting - these will be fun to play around with for different holidays!

I halved the butter as suggested in other reviews and it worked out fine.  I, too, think that a melted caramel or two would've given these a bit more of a special something.  I also used chocolate Twizzlers (couldn't find green) for the stems and they looked so cute!

There were great to look at but I personally thought the flavor was only ok. I added caramels like another reviewer said to do and I think that probably made them better. Perhaps using rice krispies and making orange rice krispie balls would be a better plan.

This recipe was a huge hit at our Halloween party! Mt husband rarely eats the sweets, but he devoured these. So easy, quick at tastes great. They do need quite a bit more cooling time (in the fridge) then the recipe calls for.

These were cute and pretty easy to make, though they surprisingly weren't sweet. Next time, I'd use a rice crispy treat recipe and add food die and candy corn so you get both cute factor AND taste.

I did everything per the recipe except I used reeses pieces instead of peanuts, 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 a cup (it was plenty). I used bag popcorn and against the warnings of other reviewers I used the "butter flavored" popcorn and it wasn't too salty at all. I omitted the licorice and just made balls and they were sooo delicious! Oh and instead of plain candy corn I found pumpkin pie flavored candy corn at Target and those combined with the reeses pieces was a match made in heaven. I can't stop eating them and my guests haven't arrived! The other thing I would do differently is double the recipe and make 24 instead of 12! Thanks for the great idea! A lot faster than I anticipated too

Not only are these adorable, but they are also very tasty! The candy corn really makes them great. I followed the recipe, as posted, and it turned out fabulous. I could not find green apple licorice (as someone else posted), so I bought a bag of Twizzlers Rainbow Twists (snack size), and used the orange, yellow, and green ones for stems. Then I barely clipped the tops of them. The Twizzlers were in the Halloween candy section. I cannot wait to make a batch for the Halloween party this year!

I wish I would have read all the reviews before I made them! I agree way too much butter..will cut down next time. Also not all of mine held together, and will maybe add some more marshmallows or carmal. But they did turn out very cute! Not a fan of black licorice... but hersey's licorice is awesome to use instead!

Only change was 1/4 c butter, no nuts (allergies)& adding about 12 caramels. My granddaughter and I had a great time making these for a party she was attending. I dipped pieces of "sticky" popcorn in green sanding sugar for leaves by the stem and used black icing for faces (see photo). Placed them on a large orange serving tray in decorated cupcake papers and put candy dipped pretzels with Halloween sprinkles in a Halloween cup in the center for a fun & sweet display. Adorable, loved by the kids as well as adults. Next time I would decrease the candy corn. Thanx

Thanks to the person that suggested adding a few caramels to enhance the flavor, I added a whole bag, more marshmellows - all of it - double!  What made the process of making the balls easier was wearing rubber gloves, spraying both front & back with an oil based spray - helped the mixture not stick.  Also, for the green stems I bought gummi worms - multi-colored - cut out green parts - what can I say?  I love my grandson and like to see him smile.

Oh how delightful!  And fun!  Super easy to make and quite yummy.  I bought "natural" (it's an actual flavor - who knew?!) microwave popcorn and 1 bag makes more than 5 cups.  No problem with too much butter taste.  Also added 1 cup of mini-marshmallows to the popcorn/peanut/candy corn mix. I'd like to try it with a couple squares of caramel melted in the butter/marshmallow mix next time, as suggested by someone else, just to enhance the flavor even more.  I'll probably add more candy corn too.

Made this for my daughter's birthday treat at school.  I could barely eat one bite - it was soooo sweet/sugary.  I'm sure the kids loved it though.  Left out the peanuts because of allergies.

This recipe got mixed reviews from my family and my daughter's softball team. They were very cute and everyone liked the taste but the popcorn was soggy & mushy-not crisp like a typical popcorn ball. I did double the recipe and added a few caramels based on other reviewers suggestions. I also used 'natural' flavor microwave popcorn. Not sure if I did something wrong or if that is just the consistency that this recipe is supposed to have?

Wanted to provide something special for my special goblins. These were quick, easy and yummy. I too reduced the butter to 1/4 c. Deleted the peanuts, and substituted gummies& white chocolate chips. Formed them by hand rather than in muffin pans, and stuck a dum-dum sucker in middle for the stem.(yeilded 8 balls) Wrapped in individual plastic bags w/ribbon..they are too cute!!

We made these for our Halloween Party. They were so cute - but no one ate them. I think they all thought they were just for decoration. Next time I will leave out the candy corn.

Got good reviews at a Halloween party. I didn't use the food coloring or licorice. I served it like rice crispy treat squares.

These were good, but WAY too sweet! Even my boyfriend who has a major sweet tooth had trouble finishing his. I could only eat about half of mine. Next time I make it I'm going to use less marshmallows, and find some other way to cut down the sweet factor.

These were ok. For whatever reason my popcorn got really soggy. I added 2 caramels like suggested. The taste was great it was the soft popcorn that turned me off to them. I think I will try to find another recipe for popcorn balls.

Once again, an awesome recipe for halloween. These were so cute and easy to make. I just molded them togther with my hands, it was a sticky mess but it seemed to be a little "funner" that way. They all seemed to have different shapes, more like a real pumpkin would. My son saw them in the refigerator and said, "awww, those are beautiful!" He is three and loved all the halloween goodies this year. This one is a keeper.

I followed the recommendation of one of the other reviews and added 2 caramel cubes into the 'sauce' and tossed a handful of mini marshmallows into the popcorn mix.  They came out pretty good - not overly sweet, and they look cute!

what I learned from this is that if you are making a dubble batch make sure you have a bowl that is big enough and 2 cupcake pans. You should also make the licorish stems smaller than it calls for! these are a great snack for people of all ages =)

Popcorn lovers well.... loved it! Be sure to mix the peanuts and popcorn thoroughly before putting them in cups. I think I added too much marsh mellows so they took much longer to set so I put them in the fridge. I used apple jolly ranchers for the stem and they went off great. I would try this again possibly for the holidays.

Great idea for halloween - always looking for something fun to do with the kids.  They enjoyed passing them out to their friends - kids ate them up and adults raved about them!  I followed the recipe on the first batch I made and they were too buttery for my taste - I did not even share them with anyone.  I made a 2nd batch and only used 3 tablespoons butter and they turned out great.  I like the M&M idea and the pretzel stick for the stem - will definitely try both of these!

i was born on halloween so i am a little biased, but these puppies rocked. i added a half cup of smuckers natural peanut butter in place of the peanuts and boosted the marshmallow infusion by a cup as well. they turned out really good.

Added 6 caramel nips, as well as the additional food coloring that was suggested . It made for the perfect flavor, and the color was much deeper. Definitely very sticky to handle and quite a bit of work to put together. Makes 12 very large pumpkins.

Giving this a 2 because it is a good idea, but the ratio of popcorn to marshmallow sauce. Getting things out of the muffin tin, even with greasing things, was a mess. After the 1st batch which I followed the directions exactly flopped, I made another batch using a popcorn ball recipe I had. That worked better because I formed the balls & wrapped in saran wrap & put in the refrigerator for awhile. I don't know if I'll make again or not, but won't use as many peanuts since I don't like to many in stuff like this.

Instead of food coloring, I use flavored jello powder which colors the popcorn balls and adds great choice of flavors!  I like addition of licorice for stem.  Very cute!

I admit I over calculated on the sauce when I converted the marshmallows to marshmallow creme. So I wrapped up my gooey balls and called them balls of brains!  Adults and kids loved the tasted and the gooey didn't seem to bother anyone.  Next time I won't add so much goo!  Very tasty!!! I think I just gained a pound!

These were easy and great! My only changes were that I already had orange gel coloring, and I added pepitas and white chocolate chips. My husband loves these, dug in, and formed the balls for me! I'm gonna make these again for Christmas, in green and red! Yummo!

This was a very interesting endeavor!  I had to double the amount of popcorn to make it easier to handle and less gooey/sticky. I could not find green licorice, so used chocolate instead. It made the pumpkin balls more realistic.  After the balls were made, I stuck pieces of candy corn on them to make eyes, noses and mouths. It was fun, to say the least, and the reaction of the kids when they saw them was amazing. The leftover "pumpkins" tasted better after they sat in the fridge for a day. I caught my husband sneaking the extras.  He thought they were a great treat. Maybe next year I'll make them for his office staff!

Super easy to do a little messy because I let the kiddos make the popcorn balls. But so fun to do , just a little cooking spray on the hands and your good to go. Have fun, we did!

It turned out real tasty. I did add a few caramels and Reeseâs pieces. Then used a MINI Reeseâs cup upside down for the stem. I couldnât find any color of licorice other than red or black. I made sure it had a sticky spot so the chocolate would stay. Wrapped in clear wrap tied in colorful ribbon.  Kids lived it

These were cute and easy. I added some melted caramels, as others suggested, and some min marshmallows to the popcorn. But they were too sweet, and never âfirmedâ, even after 24 hours.

Super easy and cute! My 3 yr old helped and had a blast! I used a full bag of the regular sized marshmallo's and melted them with the butter in the microwave. I also didn't have any peanuts, so I used macadamia nuts and pistachios. We will make this every halloween! Thanks!
