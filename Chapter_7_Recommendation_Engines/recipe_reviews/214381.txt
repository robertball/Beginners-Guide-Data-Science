I can't believe I've been published again!  This really is a fantastic recipe for such an easy one!  Like I said in the little blurb, you can add just about anything you want, even leftover rotisserie chicken.  It will be the best meal you've ever made!!!

This is a great recipe missing only the main ingredient, Sliced OKRA. Needs at least a cup of okra, medium pods slice about 1/4 in thick.  Still it is so good I will give 5 stars

I had some challenges for our dinner tonight.  I’m in Naples now but I’m going home in another day, so I wanted to come up with something using ingredients I already had.  I didn’t want to go to the store for MORE stuff, nor did I want anything wasted.  Also, I’ve got limitations, because of Hubs’ sensitive innards, with heat and spice, both of which I generally have to eliminate.  With a little research it became apparent that jambalaya, which I’ve never had before, was the way to go.  I came across a lot of good recipes for it, but none so simple, so straightforward, so uncomplicated, as Cindy’s.  Some reviewers commented her recipe was a little weak on spice – first, that’s a GOOD thing for Hubs' innards and, second, that’s easy enough to fix, right?  If you want more spice, add more spice!  I decided on this recipe but knew I would make a couple of small changes – I would cook the rice separately, only because I make every attempt to limit the amount of starch I consume.  And I used fresh, chopped, red-ripe tomatoes instead of canned.  This was, in a word, delicious.  Hubs, SO stingy with 5-star ratings, gave this an immediate 5.  Weak spice? Maybe a little – but Hubs just sprinkled a little extra Zatarain’s Creole Seasoning on his serving to his liking.  I thought it was just right. When you’ve got great flavor, you don’t need to drown a dish in spices and/or “heat.”  Except for family favorites I don’t often make the same dish twice. This one will be an exception.

I made 1 change to this.  I used Quinoa instead of Rice.  I also added some chicken.  This was GREAT!  I will be making this again.  Thanks Cindy

I really enjoyed this jambalaya.  I used converted white rice like Uncle Bens. Converted rice holds it's shape and texture in rice recipes and casseroles.  Bighunk

Great and easy! I looked at several other jambalaya recipes from this site but chose this one because it had the fewest steps....no taking meat out and putting it back in. I used a ginger chicken broth I had leftover from making chicken salad the other day, and it added a nice layer to the jambalaya (the ginger was very subtle). I meant to add a bit of chicken base to the broth since it was homemade and unseasoned, but I forgot so had to add more salt to the finished product than I would have liked. I will definitely make again using a well seasoned broth next time.

We thought this was fabulous!  Gotta love the one pot supper - less dishes :)  If you're adding shrimp, make sure rice is almost done before adding.  I threw mine in too early and the overcooked the shrimp.  Oh well - didn't ruin the dish.  I will certainly be making this again - thanks for sharing!!

Delicious!!!  I didn't change a thing and this recipe was wonderful.  We served with corn bread.  I will say that this recipe doesn't quite make 8 servings.  Maybe because our servings were "healthy" we got only 4 out of it.  If I were to make this for a crowd, which I am considering, I would double the recipe. Thank you Cindy for such a great recipe!!!  :)

Ohmigosh!!! This is SOOOOO good! My hubs and I loved this and both agree that it's the BEST jambalaya I've ever made. Another plus? Clean-up is a BREEZE since you use only one dish to cook eveything in. I pretty much followed Cindy's directions to the letter except for making a few (minor) changes to suit my / our tastes. Here's what I did: a) subbed canned tomatoes with green chiles for plain ones (we like our jambalaya HOT!!!), b) increased the Creole seasoning to 1/2 T (1/2 t was not enough, IMHO) and c) added 1 1/2 c. of shredded rotisserie chicken leftover from a meal earlier this week. None of the stores in my area sell Conecuh brand sausage, but I did find Chef Bruce Aidelles fully cooked Cajun style andouille sausage. I used the entire 12 oz. package (4 links total) since it wasn't that much more than what was called for anyways. I didn't think I'd like the addition of green bell pepper and was even contemplating omitting it alltogether, but I think leaving it out would have been a mistake (it wasn't overpowering in the least). Thanks for helping us celebrate Fat Tuesday with full bellies (even if a few days late...). :-) I will be adding this to my regular menu rotation for sure!

Very good. Put some chicken in it [with the sausage and shrimp], browned that with the sausage. Made a double batch so I don't have to cook tomorrow. can't wait for the left overs.

I made it with half can of diced tomatoes and it still came out great. My youngest kept saying how good it smell and my eldest practically scrapped the rice from the bottom of the pan. Thanks Cindy!

Easy to make and excellent flavor.  Follow directions carefully on cooking times or the rice will get gummy.

This was excellent and we loved it! The only thing I did differently was add 1/2 cup more rice. I was very impressed with how easy this was yet packed full of flavor AND seeing how there is only one pot, clean-up was a breeze. I had the leftovers today for lunch and round 2 was just as good. Thank you for sharing Cindy!

Okay, Miss Cindy, ya did it again. I used a can of RoTel (medium) tomatoes and this was "off the charts delicious".  Didn't change anything else. We had guests and I made a copy of the recipe, at their request, for them to take home.  Easy, quick, delicious, one pot, did I say delicious? I love your style!

I followed the advice of Mike and sauteed the rice before adding the liquids.  HUGE difference!  The rice is perfect.  I made mine with sausage and shrimp with some Old Bay Seasoning.  It's great.

Yum!  Absolutely perfect-and fairly simple:)  Added another 3/4 cup of rice and water-only because we were serving kids.  Still had great flavor!

We really enjoyed this! I made it as written but used the the whole pound of smoked sausage. I did find the Conecuh sausage in my grocery store and it is very good. I'll be making this again!

Wow!  This is SO good!!  I bought a 10-ounce package of smoked sausage and just used all of it.  I had Creole seasoning on hand, so I used that and just added extra since Creole isn't as spicy.  I used brown jasmine rice, so I added a little extra broth and let it cook an additional 15 minutes before adding the shrimp.  Both of my daughters devoured their servings as well and asked if I would make this again sometime.  Thanks, Cindy, for yet another awesome recipe!!

I made this for dinner last night with a few changes. I strained the tomatoes and reduced the chicken stock a bit and added some Pinot Noir. This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone.  Unfortunately I didn't have any garlic, which was a shock to me, so I upped the Cajun seasoning by quite a bit and since the farmers sausage I used was pretty garlicky the combination worked. I used a mix of brown, red and wild rice and I also added some chicken, which I tossed with the cooked shrimp and added after the rice sausage and veggies were cooked. My family loved it, will make again.

This was fabulous!  I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used creole ( not sure if there is a difference.) I used a lot more than 1/2 t.   Thanks for a great recipe, Cindy!

I have never made jambalaya, but I did sample some in a restaurant. It was made with orzo rather than rice. I followed Cindy's ingredients, used orzo and some wild rice. Great taste medley. This will become a new fall fav recipe

Amazingly easy recipe that you could easily adjust to your liking (I subbed the shrimp with chicken breast cubes since the bf was allergic).  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars bc even after doubling the cajun seasoning, there wasn't any spice...this I will have to play with!

Made this last night, it is wonderful. I added all the good stuff, chicken, sausage and shrimp since there are no small eaters in my house.  I will keep this in my monthly rotation.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I cooked this last night.  It was delicious.  I would withdraw some of cayenne and crushed red pepper for less spicy taste.  It is very unusual for us, Northern Californians, to taste Southern dish and my husband loved it.

An A+++ dish.  No need to change a thing. Delicious and the spices were perfect for those who like it mildly zesty.  I added 1 1/4 cups green pepper for preference.

My fiance and I really loved this dish, as it was fairly simple and tasted so good! Didn't change a thing to this recipe, it was perfect as is for our tastes. Made a huge batch to freeze for later use - easy meal to reheat! Thanks Cindy!

Once again Cindy, spot on with the ingredients. For those of you who are as handicapped at measurements as me, 1 cup of chopped peppers equals 2 good sized peppers, the celery is 6 stalks. I hate chopping!! Took about a half hour to prepare the ingredients before starting to cook. However, very worth it. It is delish! One other thing, it is pricey. Went to the store for the ingredients for this only and spent $47.00. I had no ingredients on hand..none. Not even the cajun spice. Only chicken broth and thyme and salt. My bay leaves were ancient so I had to buy them too.  But it was very good. Thanks Cindy!!! And if you haven't already..try her clam chowder!

Excellent, excellent Jambalaya! Everyone loved it. Followed recipe with the exception of adding in a hand full of chopped ham and 1 roasted chicken breast shredded just to use up some stuff out of the fridge. Received compliments from the whole family. Thanks for sharing, Cindy!

I hate it when people review recipes and give them a poor rating when not made exactly as written.  I thought this recipes was terrific, I didn't have celery, bay leaves or thyme...but without these things it was awesome, with them I am sure even better!!!  I give it 5 stars, my husband loves jambalaya and was pretty impressed.

Delicious!! My husband hates rice so this was a risky one, but I went heavy on the cajun seasoning and it came out amazing. Will definitely be having this again!

Tasty, tasty, tasty! Usually I just make jambalaya from one of those box kits and call it good...but I figured I'd try to mix it up. This is a delicious, better version of what I'm use to making. I added chicken to the mix but thats the only thing I changed. 

will definitely make again.

This was really really good! I am from Baton Rouge originally and this was very authentic. I used andouille chicken sausage and added lots of hot sauce. To tone down the spice I served with homeade garlic bread. I added in 2 cups of rice and some additional liquid. DH NEVER eats left overs & he had this for lunch the next day! Thanks Cindy!!

Very very good.  We used chicken and sausage because most of my family won't eat shrimp.  Very easy recipe and my kids really enjoyed it.  Topped with a little bit of sour cream-yumm-o!

We enjoyed this.  Made it as close to the recipe as possible, but I had no idea about what sausage to use (we're up here in the frozen North), so I used beef smoked sausage. If you're worried about the recipe being too spicy, I didn't find it that way and I can be cowardly.  I also made my own seasoning using a recipe from this site.  Thanks again, Cindy!

This recipe is a keeper!  I've made this quite a few times, especially in the cold months.  I have subbed Sweet & Hot Italian sausage at times.  (note to self remember to omit the cayenne pepper when using hot sausage).  I appreciate that this is a one pot meal; I also make sure to add the shrimp just the last 5-8 (depending on size) min. and cook until only until they are done.  Thanks Cindy for this recipe!

We just made this recipe tonight and it was excellent!  I had yellow bell pepper on hand rather than green, and we also threw in some boneless skinless thighs we grilled up in advance on the grill.  Otherwise, followed the directions as is and it was really yummy.  Thank you Cindy!

Whoa!  This is bang up good!  Forget the first two ingredients, (oil and sausage) and the last (shrimp) and you've got the basis for jambalaya.  Cindy, her- self said "add anything you like...".  But you can use chicken, alone.  Or just shrimp.  Or crawfish.  And here's the killer, it's a heck of a vegetarian dish. The secret to the recipe is (to my way of thinking) is the cajun seasoning.  You cannot do better than this recipe for seasoning from this site, Cajun-Spice-Mix-2.  Many thanks, Cindy.

This receipe is so delicious!  My 16 year old son saw me making it.  As soon as he saw the green pepers he instantly started complaining.  However, when he took his first bite, he said it was the best dish I had ever made!!  Both of my kids have been begging me to make more and that we should have it once a week.  I am very happy that I now have a new "favorite" to add to my recipe box.  I made the recipe exactly as is, the only change my kids would like is to add more shrimp!!

It was very good. Received rave reviews from a church social. The only change I made was to add about 3/4 pound of cooked chicken. My own preference would to have added some hot sauce, but due to the crowd that was present I did not add any.  One of the best and quickest jambalayas I/ve tried. Good job Cindy!

Fantastic and so easy to make.  This will become a regular in our home.  It has just the right amount of kick to it but was not too spicy at all.  I was going to add the okra as someone else suggested but forgot to buy it.  Although, I did take anothers advice and added fresh mushrooms.  Great recipe!  Thanks again for sharing.

No need to change a thing with this recipe.  I followed this recipe to a tee, right down to the timing of each instruction. The recipe was extremely easy to follow. The spices were the right kind and the right amount.   I used my Dutch oven on the stove top so that if I had to, I could pop it in the oven to keep warm. A fabulous recipe, absolutely superb!!

Really good and quite a nice spice to it. I like the spice so it wasn't too powerful. I also took some advice and put in the rice in the last 40 minutes and it mixed very very well. I also added garlic and doubled the bell pepper.

We thought this was really good. I had to use chipotle seasoning because there was an ice storm and I couldnt get to the store and the flavor was still great. I added just a splash of white wine, personal preference, because it seemed very thick. My 16 year old daughter told me she didnt like sausage until now, she said its a keeper!
update: made this again without adding rice (cooked and served underneath) I like the consistency better this way but 5 stars no matter how you choose to do it.

sooo good! i made this for a small dinner party and everyone loved it! I made it as written except I put a whole pound of sausage (b/c I knew I wouldn't use the rest of it for anything else and didn't want it to go to waste) and it was great. I will definately be making this again!!

I came across this recipe during Mardi Gras.  My boyfriend is from Louisiana and I thought it would be nice to make this since he's so far from home.  This recipe is so easy to follow and the results were great.  I used Andouille sausage with shelled and deveined shrimp.  I did follow another suggestion to add sliced okra and it was the perfect addition.  I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning since that is a staple in our house.  I was afraid to see how my boyfriend was going to like it and he ate the entire bowl.  Then I thought he was just being nice... and he went back for another.  Then another.  And took it for lunch the next day.  That just shows how good this recipe is.  It is definitely a keeper!

my family I love this! Including my 18 month old and 3 year old daughter. the only changes I made was at a bit more mince garlic and a bit more Cajun seasoning cause we like spice. But otherwise everything was great!

I loved the recipe, especially since I'm not a fan of okra. I did use crushed bay leaves instead of the three that the recipe called for but it still turned out great. I also used smoked beef sausage instead of pork and it had great flavor.

Love this recipe, has great flavor, but I did increase the Cajun seasoning for a bit more of a bite and I have used both white rice and wild grain rice.   I recommend this recipe to my friends a lot.

This was very tasty!  I have always used box Jambalaya and was very happy with the results of the home made.  I did make a few changes, I used turkey sausage and brown rice. I used the Cajun seasoning recipe from this site and added 2 tsp. Will make this again for sure.

Fantastic! I was looking for something to make on our camping trip and didn't want the basic chili or stew. This was so easy to make. Since I can't eat sausage I used turkey Kielbasa. I did add two garden jalapeños to spice it up a bit. My husband and I ate all but one bowl and fought over who could eat the leftover bowl the next day for lunch...I won. Thanks Cindy for such an easy but delicious Jambalaya.

Tastes great, and like one reviewer said only one pot dish.   I only had hot Italian sausage on hand so used that.  Will definitely make it often!

This is great jambalaya. I always use instant rice so I changed the cooking process and didn't need the chicken broth. I was out of green pepper so I had to leave that out :( and I don't care for celery so I left that out. Very good!!!

This recipe is so easy to make and turns out so yummy all of the time!  I did use a turkey sausage ring to make it a little healthier, and loved it.  I like to add Tabasco to give it a little heat.

Wonderful! I love that I can use one pot- or just a big skillet, and it doesnt have to cook in the crock pot for hours!  Didnt have celery, didn't miss it. and I only used 14.5 oz of chicken broth b/c I didnt want to open another can, also didnt miss it. Otherwise followed recipe exactly.   FYI- I ended up more than doubling the cajun seasoning to get it hot enough for us, and I dont consider us to be particularly spicy people

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was good, but not enough flavor for me.  Added more Tonys and I think next time I will substitute chicken for the shrimp.  I think part of the problem was the sausage (my fault) I bought cheap instead of the good stuff, will def do better next time!

FANTASTIC!!!! I doubled the recipe and added 3/4 cubed ham and used huge shrimp- YUMMY. I did used brown basmati rice since its what i had on hand and needed to use it up. Next time I will use regular brown rice instead since the basmati rice fell apart a bit. This is going into regular rotation at my house!! I am going to attempt to freeze some- I hope it freezes well....

This jambalaya is outstanding!!!  I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible.  I used Aidell's Cajun Andouille sausage, so should have reduced or even left out the cajun seasoning seasoning altogether. Leaving it in made the dish just a tad too spicy for me. If I had used plain smoked sausage I certainly would keep the listed amount of cajun seasoning in as written. Still, (even with the spiciness) this dish was absolutely delicious and will make it a regular in my meal rotations.  Thank you, Cindy!!

The hubs says 5 stars. I didn't have any smoked sausage so I subbed some ham from the freezer and it worked fine. I also have a ton of Rotel so I used that instead of reg tomatoes. It was the perfect amout of spicy for us with a little additional caj seasoning. We like food spicier than most, though. A very pantry and freezer friendly meal that only needs 1 pot. Perfect for a hot summer evening when you don't want to turn on the oven or do a bunch of dishes. Glad I finally tried this Cindy.

This is the first time I have made Jambalaya and I was very happy with the recipe. I used brown rice instead, so added more liquid and cooked it alot longer, but it turned out great.

I made this Monday after work and it was great. I subsituted the shrimp with skinless,boneless chicken thighs and cooked the chicken along with the sausage. It smelled good and tasted even better. It was easy and didn't take much time to make at all.

This is a wonderful recipe and is super easy.  We added a little more onion than it calls for, and a little more cajun seasoning for an extra kick. (Used "Weber's N'orleans Cajun" seasoning.  Very good!)  We also had to end up using minute rice since we realized we didn't have regular rice....we just added it toward the end of cooking.   Great recipe, and we will be making this many more times!  It would be a great recipe to make for watching a football game (a nice variation from burgers, brats, and chili.)

I have really high hopes for this recipe!  I think the method is almost exactly spot-on, and the texture was perfect.  I used turkey kielbasa because the called-for sausage doesn't seem to exist in my town, which might have been blasphemy but which was very tasty, anyway.  I think that the heat levels recommended in this recipe are off, since cooking on medium low for a half an hour resulted in my rice burning to the pot.  I'd also be careful with the bay; my bay leaves were gargantuan, and maybe that was the problem, but three was way, way, way too much.  I normally barely notice bay, but here it was overpowering.  Next time I make it - and I probably will make it again, because I love jambalaya and this recipe is so close to perfect - I'll use one bay leaf and half the celery, and simmer on low.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  EDIT:  Made it again, with my planned changes - kind of disappointing.  I'll keep looking, but thanks anyway!

OMG, OMG, OMG!  This is just wickedly awesome and so easy to make.  It is delicious with only sausage as well.  This is about as close to Louisiana Jambalaya as you can get.  Serve this up with surf and turf or soft shell crab.  Fantabulous!

OK, this recipe is a hit in our house. We are Antiguan and have many West Indian dishes a little similar in prep, but made with fish or chicken, goat meat, etc.  The whole family liked it.

Delicious! This recipe turned out perfectly. I added chicken breast chunks (cooked with the onions and peppers) and used turkey andouille sausage.

I made this dish for dinner and it turned out really good. I did add green and red bell peppers and green onions along with the other veggies. I also used jasmine rice which held up nicely and not overcooked. Towards the end I did need to add a little more chicken broth mixed with water but all in all it was a very tasty dish! Thanks Cindy!!

This was my first time making Jambalaya and I was not disappointed. It was easy and the flavors were perfect. I made just a few tweaks: I added blacked chicken and mushrooms.  I doubled the cajun spice because I bought the generic supermarket blend and assumed it was half salt. I left out the additional salt. Also, at the recommendation of others, I substituted the can of diced tomatoes for the smaller (10 oz) can of Rotel's tomatoes and chiles. That was a good suggestion because it added depth of flavor without making a tomato soup. It was a big hit this Fat Tuesday.

Great meal for football Sunday! I added a pound of cut up boneless chicken and used 1 pound of Andouille sausage along with 1 pound of shrimp. Doubled the rest of the ingredients to feed our guests. Served with fresh homemade corn bread. Will make again.

Wow Cindy!  Love LOVE this recipe! This one definitely went on the Family Favorites list!   I took another revierw's advice and sautéed the rice before adding wet ingredients. I also used 1 can diced tomatoes and one can Rotel (blending it together first because my kids don't like big tomato pieces.)  My husband cooked black beans to go with it and, voilá, we had a meal!  Thanks for the recipe!  - Another Pensacola Girl :)

So delicious! So easy to use up leftovers. We had leftovers from a crab dinner so I made fish stock and used that in place of the chicken. I also had leftover brown rice and some roasted corn that I added at the end.

I have made this recipe at least once every two months and we LOVE it! I use sausage and shrimp and I love to use one Boil in the Bag rice packs for this, especially the brown rice kind, since they're exactly one cup of rice and it works perfectly in this. Not a Southerner, so I'm not an expert. But as a Westerner it is a fantastic and easy to make recipe!

This turned out great and was pretty easy! I used hot Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand. Also threw in a good pinch of cayenne pepper and some leftover roast chicken. Will be cooking this again, for sure.

My husband loved this and it was very easy to adjust ingredients to what I had on hand.  I picked andouille sausage which make it too spicy for my taste (my own fault, not reflection on the recipe itself), but it was very flavorful.

I used cooked cubed chicken, cubed smoked sausage and cooked cubed ham since I don't like shrimp.  It was fantastic!!!  So much better than the Zatarain's box I usually get!

Loved this recipe. I used Andouille sausage. One could probably add another cup of rice to make this less "liquidy." Adjust the Cajun seasoning to your personal taste.

I made this almost completely as written, EXCEPT... I did not cook my shrimp for 10 minutes. I waited until everything was done, turned the heat to low, then added the shrimp, and let the hot mixture cook the shrimp through. I think cooking the shrimp in the mix for 10 minutes would have definitely overcooked them. Otherwise, an awesome recipe! Thank you!

Thanks Cindy! I had cooked white and wild rice which made putting this together a breeze. I added some chicken broth in with a can of Rotel and roasted red and yellow bell peppers. No shrimp this time but chicken instead. I may have overdone it on the cajun spice, but with some corn muffins slathered in butter it went down very well. It was better the next day after everything melded together since I didn't cook the rice with it. Yummy!

This was really good but I would cut the shrimp and sausage in half and add chicken, shrimp was a bit overpowering.

Wonderful recipe! I don't like celery, onions, tomatoes, or bell pepper, but I ate them all in this dish and loved it! It was a big hit and every last bit was eaten by 4 people (it makes 8 servings). This is definitely a go-to recipe for me now!

This needed a lot of extra cajun seasoning in my opinion. I ended up adding more than a half a teaspoon more than what was called for and still had to add Tabasco sauce to give it the heat we are used to in a jambalaya.  I used just shrimp to cut back on calories. It also took longer for the rice to cook and absorb all the liquid that was called for. It was a good basic recipe but I think it needs something a little extra.

I loved it.  I cut the recipe to 4, but used the full amounts of sausage and shrimp.  Otherwise, I think it would have been lacking.  I also used the Cajun seasoning recipe on this site.

Very good!  The two of us finished this in 3 nights.  We used Linguica (Portuguese sausage) instead of regular smoked sausage, and it was great; a much meatier, more natural, and less salty/processed version of sausage.

This was GREAT. I left out the celery b/c I don't care for it and used turkey sausage. YUMMMY! I will definitely make this again.

OMG!!  I've used a lot of recipes from various sites, but this was by far the best.  Did not change a thing, except for adding two medium chicken breasts.  I cooked it last night for dinner and there was not a grain of rice left for leftovers!!!  Will be keeping this recipe forever.  Thank you Cindy.

Yummy! Made three mini changes and they were to add 1/2lb frozen okra, used quinoa insted of rice and to used a full lb. of smoked turkey kielbasa. Excellent and this makes a lot...leftovers were even better. Thank you Cindy for another great recipe! Will make again! :)

Cindy I have tried a lot of jambalaya recipes on this site and they have all been ho hum.  This one is excellent.  I can not find Conecuh brand here in the southwest so I used Boarshead Hot Smoked Sausage and it was delicious with the shrimp.  Just the right amount of seasonings too.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.

I've only ever had Zataran's jambalaya so I wanted to foray in the world or something a bit more authentic.  I love this!  I left out the celery, added a bit more peppers and didn't use the shrimp.  It turned out excellent!  Next time I might use a bit more cajun seasoning then called for (I used the recipe from this site) because we like spice!!

I changed a few things as I did not have them on hand, used diced tomatoes with green pepper and onion as well as smoked sausage and cooked chicken the same time I sauted my pepper and onions.  I left out bay leaf and garlic but added my cajun spice.   Turned out really good and I don't like jambalaya Thanks for a great recipe

Cindy! What a great jambalaya! :)  I did as another reviewer suggested and sauteed the rice prior to adding it in with the other ingredients. I don't know if it added anything, but wow, this was great!

I just finished making/eating this.  I love ordering jambalaya out at restaurants, but this was my first time making it.  It turned out great!  Thanks Cindy for an easy at-home version.  I used jasmati rice (all i had) and won't next time.  I added some chicken along with the sausage and shrimp.  Besides using plain white rice next time, my other changes would be to buy a spicier sausage, use more cajun seasoning, and make cornbread spoon pudding to go with it!

We really liked this dish..even my kids enjoyed it and they are picky.  I didn't have the diced tomato so I added pasta sauce..next time I would add the diced fireroasted tomatoes because the pasta sauce was a little too thick.  Great tastes though..will make again

This is so delicious and easy.  Thanks, Cindy!  I followed the basic recipe, but added a little more chicken stock as it seemed too dry before serving.  I realize that you can't overdue this as the rice can get mushy.  I would suggest adding the shrimp just before the rice is done.  That gives the rice time to finish and the shrimp time to cook. I  added about 1 and 1/2 cup of fresh chopped asparagus with the other veggies.  The sausage I used was a smoked chicken (Hillshire Farm brand) and it was delicious. We are definitely going to make this again as one pot dishes are very popular in my house.

Flavor was excellent but the end product was rather glutineous.  I like my rice to be fluffy and the grains separate. Next time I'll change the proportion of liquid.  Used the Cajun Seasoning recipe from this site which was very good and spicy.

This recipe was wonderful! Nice work! Made a few changes, used low sodium chicken stock, lots of cajun seasoning, lots of garlic and some heat. I used frozen shrimp, pre-cooked. The won't overcook that way. I can't wait for the yummy leftovers. This one works!

Holy moly!  We’ve been making jambalaya from a Cajun cookbook we’ve had for years.  This recipe blows it away!  We used Andouille sausage and cubed chicken thighs plus the shrimp.  Will be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks Cindy!

I was a bit nervous when putting in the uncooked rice without much fluid in the pot but my worries were unfounded.  The dish turned out great.  I used only a bit of salt during the cooking but used a dash of Old Bay seasoning at the end for the extra kick (and sodium).  Thank you for the recipe.

Great, easy and nice change of pace recipe!
I added a 1/2 tsp of Old Bay and a few drops of Tabasco. Also as suggested I added some cooked chicken and scallops. My wife (not really a cajun or spicy food fan) had thirds!

Well let me start by saying WOW!!!! This is the first time I've made jambalaya and Cindy made me look like a pro! Thanks to Mike for the rice tip as well. I'm a Florida native so I put lots of seafood in ours. In addition to the sausage and shrimp I added lobster and crawfish tails. I also reduced the chicken broth and replaced with1/4 c of Sauvignon Blanc. For the tomatoes I used a can of the fire roasted w/ garlic by Hunts. We like our food a bit spicy so I used 1tbsp of the Cajun spice and 1/2 tsp of old bay. Thanks to Cindy for taking the mystery out of jambalaya!!!

I followed the recipe except that I added the rice to the sausage/veggie mixture and cooked it for a few minutes as Mike suggested in a previous review. It made sense since that is how we make our Mexican rice, & then I added the rest of the ingredients.Close to the end I tested it and realized it needed more spicy heat and more Cajun seasoning in addition to more rice. So I put more rice on to cook separately and increased cayenne and crushed red peppers. As Emeril would say, "we needed to kick it up a notch!" I think is a nice basic jambalya, and we enjoyed it with my changes, but I'm either going to tweak this recipe more next time, or I'm going to try another recipe.   Just one southern gal's opinion.

Cindy's Jambalaya Haiku: "Baby ate this too! In fact, we all adored it! Just needed some heat." Husband, baby girl, 8-year old daughter, and myself all ate Cindy's jambalaya voraciously, although I had to add some hot sauce to give it more of the kick that I want out of my Cajun chow. Only change that I made was to use chicken (I had already cooked, shredded and frozen it another time) instead of shrimp.

Made creole seasoning from this site and added 2 Tablespoons, which was the perfect amount of spice by my standards.  I added 4 fresh cut up juicy red tomatoes from my garden, along with using fresh thyme (1 tablespoon+).  This was so easy & delicious, even on a warm day!!! Yummy!!

I loved this! I didn't use shrimp because I'm in college and on a budget, but used some Italian sausage instead. That was ok, but would have been better with some ground beef. The recipe was awesome and I will definitely be making again.

I really like it. Might try it next time without the celery and Thyme, because I associate those flavors with stuffing--- I know, weird, but I really like it. Hoping my kids do as well.

Made this for Fat Tuesday and my whole family loved it!  So easy and it was ingredients I already had on hand.  Next time I'll add a bit more rice.

Prepared for Fat Tuesday. Used basmati and added small chicken chunks. For us, flavor missing something. Added fresh-ground pepper at the table and it helped. Next day flavor was completely improved (4 star), so my suggestion is make ahead. Unfortunately this is not a dish that can be simmered for too long. Lucky that my supermarket carries Conecuh sausage because it surely made a diff - great smoky taste. Thanks for the hint and the recipe, Cindy.

This was really delicious! I had to make just a couple minor changes - didn't have celery or peppers on hand so left them out, and we have a chicken allergy so I substituted vegetable broth.  I also ended up having to hold it off for a whole hour, as one of my family was late getting home, but I just kept adding broth as needed with the heat on very low.  It was a huge hit - so flavorful and very filling.  Thank you!!

My husband is from New Orleans and its approved. But i would reduce shrimp to half of recipe due to personal reference. And add ANDULLIE  sausage instead of smoke sausage.

Cindy, thank you so much for posting this one pot wonder!  We found the flavor excellent.  I used 12oz. smoked beef sausage and decided to taste before adding the salt and it was perfect for us without the salt.  I used Zatarans creole seasoning and frozen peppers along with the fresh onion, etc. cooking times were spot on.  Will definitely make this many times more.

Very good indeed. Used cauliflower rice instead of white rice to reduce carbs and increase nutrition. Still added two cans of chicken broth but then added 1/2 c of quinoa. Stewed for 2+ hours to cook down and it was great! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.   Halved the sausage and subbed scallops for shrimp.  Added red beans and doubled the tomatoes.    Doubled the Cajun spice too.   Needed okra though, but still very good.

It was my night to cook supper during our houseboating vacation on Lake Shasta, CA.  I tripled the recipe & tossed in leftover chicken, turkey, ham, sliced Costco polish sausage & a 2# bag of  frozen shrimp.  I used Old Bay & a few crushed red pepper flakes to keep it a bit milder for the kids.  What a rock star I was! 24 servings fed 12 people with nary a bite leftover.

Amazing, hands down!! I substituted chicken for the shrimp and wasn't able to find the same type of sausage(I ended up using Andouille) and it was so delicious. I made a double-batch and I am glad I did- my family devoured all of it.

It tasted like something my grandmother would cook up. I did get a little creative with the seasoning (Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning) was my base, and added more than what the recipe called for because I like it salty. But all in all, best recipe I found on the fly!

It was so easy to make and very delicious. My 11 year old daughter helped make it. I have 6 kids. 3 of which are teenagers so we doubled the recipe. My kids, who are normally very picky eaters, ate every last bit.

Just made this, and it was so good! I did do the California thing and I used brown rice instead and it still turned out amazing. Since I did use brown rice I added a little more chicken broth and simmered it 15 minutes longer to accommodate the brown rice

This was so easy and delicious. I also added okra and a little cayenne for heat.

This recipe was delicious. I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, but I left out the bay leaves cause I was out.  I want to try those next time I make it though. I took it to a potluck at church and the bowl was scraped clean! I also took another reviewers advice to saute the rice until it turned white, then added the wet ingredients. It only took a couple minutes and it did help the rice to keep from turning mushy. Thanks Cindy for the great recipe!

Thought that it was really delicious and simple to prepare!  Had this with homemade hush puppies. What a wonderful meal that reminded me of my time in the south.  I added a little cayenne just to give a little more heat.

We really enjoyed this.  Made exactly as written except no Bay Leaf.  Kids ate left overs for breakfast and have asked for this again twice this week. We will be having this often, next time I will omit shrimp as hubby is allergic!

Great recipe!  It definitely deserves it's current All Recipe rating.  I used crawfish instead of shrimp.  It was a big hit with the family.

I made this last night, with the exception of leaving out the bell pepper, using kielbasa sausage, using a half pound of shrimp, and using Old Bay instead of cajun seasoning, since that's what I had on hand. It was fabulous and my hubby put it on the "definite do again" list. It took a little longer to completely cook the rice (about 5 minutes more). The resting period is necessary to thicken it up and finish cooking the rice, so don't skip that step.

This was fantastic!!  I made it for Fat Tuesday and my husband and children loved it.  I did add a little chicken, but other than that went precisely by the recipe above.  This is a keeper for sure!! Thank you :)  And, just a fun little side note...I used to teach school in the little town where Conecuh Sausage is made. It is a family favorite!!!

Loved this recipe.  I had to make some changes, but then that's what recipes are for, aren't they?  Made my own cajun spice using one from Allrecipes to which I added thyme, oregano and bay leaf.  Didn't have green pepper but did have freeze-dried red pepper so reconstituted that.  Added ham in addition to other meats/seafood.  Also, instead of using olive oil, I chopped 1 slice of bacon, browned it and used that oil to cook everything in.  It was dee-lish!

Wow, I don't think I've ever commented on a recipe on here, but I LOVED this! I did make a few small changes after reading some of the other comments. I used a can of chopped tomatoes with green chilis, added a few shallots (like garlic & an onion combined), omitted the sausage (personal preference) and substituted chicken. I cut up the raw chicken into cubes and cooked it a little with some salt & pepper and used all natural Urban Accents "Cajun Street" (savory, spicy creole seasoning). I found this pre-made spice to be excellent and have just enough heat. Found it at my local grocery store. Absolutely will make this again and my husband loved it too!

This is excellent! We've never had jambalaya before but I've always wanted to try it. Next time I will put a little more Creole seasoning in it but its was perfectly spiced for the kids. I used minute rice (it's what I had) and added leftover chicken, smoked sausage,and 2 pounds of shrimp as well as leftover peas. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This is a really great base!  I didn't have shrimp so I substituted some langostino lobster that I had leftover.  At the end I added cayenne, salt and more cajun seasoning.  Very good.

Cindy, thanks for sharing this recipe.  It was supremely easy and just delicious.  I followed the recipe, but I did not use shrimp.  I added cubed chicken breast along with the sausage.  I couldn't wait to have leftovers for lunch today, so I had it for breakfast instead.  lol

This is a fast and fantastic Jambalaya recipe.  I'm from southern Mississippi and this will replace the more tedious method I've used in the past.  I made it with deer sausage as well as with chicken in addition to the suggested traditional sausage and shrimp.  Any meat works with this recipe.

This really is a great recipe, and just like the author stated, you can add whatever you like. Most of my family doesn't like shrimp so I make it with andouille sausage and chicken.  We do like spicy so I added a few diced jalapeños.  I have made this a few times now and we love it, thanks Cindy!

This was SO GOOD!!!  I only used sausage (all I had on hand so I used 1 lb).  I didn't change anything else.  I've been wanting to add a jambalaya recipe to my rotation and THIS IS IT!  Comes together so fast and is really, really tasty!  Thanks for this great recipe!

Yummy! Easy! I only had frozen cooked shrimp, which I thawed and added at the very end. I used Uncle Ben's converted rice since that's what I had on hand, as well, and it turned out perfectly. My "to taste" on the seasoning was to double it, and serve it with hot sauce. I should add that I do not put bay leaves in anything, but that's just personal preference. Thanks!

This was a good base but if I had made it the way it was written it would have been way too bland for my taste.  I added in a handful of sliced jalapenos, tabasco sauce, and tripled the Cajun seasoning.  Only problem was my rice for some reason did not all the way through, but I don't think this was the recipe's fault.

I am not sure what I thought I was going to get when I made this. One thing I was sure of is there would be one at the table to complain. To my surprise everyone in the house not only ate this but loved it. It was mild and not too spicy which is great for the kids. The hubby just doctored his up with extra Cajun seasoning and tobasco. The flavors were wonderful. This was asked to be put on the dinner rotation from now on. Thanks Cindy for giving me a meal with no complaints, hard to do with an opinionated 5 year old.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice, once with shrimp and once with just sausage.  it is fantastic either way. I also used some veggies out of my garden and homemade sausage. A keeper for sure. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent & hardy!  Omitted the celery, added 1/2 tsp extra of cajun seasoning.  Used diced tomatos w/ jalapenos.  Gave it extra kick.  Simply & easy one pot dish!  Will definitely be a staple in our house!

We really didn't care for this one at all.  Maybe too many bay leaves?  I won't be making it again to find out!  I'm thinking that maybe my family doesn't care for jamblaya, it was the first time I made it.

This was my first time making jambalaya.  I would definitely use this recipe again.  I used canned tomatoes with green chilies for extra spice.

Oh my, this was DELICIOUS.  I was looking for an easy jambalaya recipe and this fit the bill.  For spices, I used Slap Ya Mamma, and it was to die for.  Will definitely make again1

Great flavor in this dish. Texture was a bit wet but that was exactly what I was looking for to make as meal prep for my husband’s dinners (which he has to reheat at work).  My only change to the recipe was that I tripled the amount of Cajun seasoning and it ended up having an amazing flavor. Wouldn’t change a thing! I made a double batch and it produced roughly 20 cups total so the recipe’s servings are likely a heavy cup each.

DELICIOUS!! This year I'm trying to make dishes to celebrate Mardi Gras season and this is a winner.  I only added a few things based on others' reviews: I increased the cajun seasoning to 1/2 Tablespoon and added some sliced okra. Thanks for such an amazing and easy recipe.

It was so very easy and it was delicious.  The only thing I would say is I had to double the time to cook the rice to 40mins before adding the shrimp

Delicious and super easy! I made the recipe as written by the original chef. I used cooked shrimp, which were an accidental purchase, and they got a bit dry. I will use raw shrimp next time. 
I am not a huge fan of spicy flavor, but my 18 month old son and I loved the dish. Dad said it was great but a bit spicy. I used Slap Your Mama Cajun seasoning and Aidells Cajun sausages. Thank you for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

This was really easy and quite yummy!!! I added an extra teaspoon of cajun seasoning and it was right on the money for our liking... I didnt have plain white rice so I used basmati and it unfortunately got a bit pasty (all my fault)... make sure to use the regular white rice! This recipe is a keeper.

This was amazing. I used turkey smoked sausage and brown rice (check your cook times, different than white rice) which still tasted restaurant quality and brought it down to 190 cal/serving. My husband has always loved jambalaya but I was afraid to make it from scratch....will probably never have store bought again!

This turned out great! I used linguica sausage and added in some shrimp. I didn’t have diced tomatoes so I used stewed. Next time I would add more shrimp and maybe some sautéed chicken breast as well. Delicious!

This is a great flavorful recipe that is a good base for those who like to tweak/create their own versions.  Smoked sausage comes 13.5 ounce packages.  The next time I make this, I will use the whole package and not just half a pound.  It adds a nice flavor to the mix.  I added fresh mushrooms and a cup of frozen corn.  My husband loved it.  
I think I will try 2 cans of crushed tomatoes next time.  NIce to be able to play with it.

I was surprised at how good this turned out!! I only made minor changes based on other reviews, cooked the rice seperately and stirred in towards the end, added chicken with the sausage( will definately be using better sausage) the hillshire farm andouille sausage tastes like all the others they make, so choose wisely lol, and even though i cant handle spicy i added quite a bit more cajun seasoning, next time i may even sneak in some okra, i cant thank you enough for this recipe! It was sooooo good!!

Very good, easy recipe. Easy to adapt with any additions, like chicken, you'd like. I like to make recipes as shown the first time but this time I had to use veg stock instead of chicken. I could of sworn I had chicken stock, I always have chicken stock! The veg stock tasted great but I will try chicken stock next time to see which I prefer.

I added chicken first then the sausage.  Added the rice and sautéed that. Then the stock and tomatoes and veggies.  I did add a little red wine to make it heartier.  Turned out awesome

This was excellent.  Might need to add a little more Cajun spice or possibly use Rotel instead of the tomatoes - next time.

Wow!!!! I made this for the first time tonight. The flavors compliment each other and the entire family asked for seconds. The only thing I did different is add some chicken. We will definitely have this recipe on our “go to” list. Thanks!

Fantastic!!!!  Made exactly like the recipe except I used red bell pepper instead of green because I don’t like green.  I added chicken.  I was amazing!  I also sautéed cauliflower rice instead of using regular rice because we are trying to eat low carb.  It was perfect!  Used the recipe for 6, and there is only the 2 of us, but now I have left overs for my hubby while I’m out of town next week...he is so pumped!

My first time making jambalaya so I don’t have much to compare it to, but this was very good. I added chicken, red beans and extra spice (cajun spice mix on this site). I used smoked turkey sausage.  I will make again!

LOVED IT! Will make again! I love Cajun food but never made jambalaya before. Perfectly seasoned for the kids but for the adults I will add more Cajun spices next time to bring it up a notch.

I made this in a slow cooker and it turned out great. I didn't have any cajun spice, so I made some with paprika, onion powder, oregano, thyme, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. i ended up with 4 tsp and used all of it. My kids liked it as is, but my wife and I added some tabasco sauce and it was perfect.

Just made this tonight. Soo good. My 13 year old is on her 2nd bowl. I used the frozen Cajun mix of bell peppers, celery and onion. Like 3/4th a bag and added half bag of frozen okra. I only had minute rice so I made that separate. I will do 2 minute bags of rice next time. My kid asked for it to be on monthly rotation so I will! Thanks for an easy delicious recipe this Fat Tuesday!

Just to the amount of vegetables and cajun spice. Also added a few squirts of hot pepper sauce. I like spicy food.  I don't think you can hurt this recipe. It's really tasty. I highly recommend it.

Delicious and easy! I added okra and chicken thighs and did one spicy sausage and one chicken apple sausage for some sweetness. Used a tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. Will be making this again!

This recipe is fabulous! I made a couple of modifications based on other reviews. (1) lightly browned the rice/orzo in the oil before adding liquids and (2) amped up the heat with a generous shake of crushed red pepper since we like heat. My husband is still raving about it, as am I. The sausage and shrimp simply melts in your mouth.

I substituted Old Bay for the Cajon spices and thyme only because I did not have them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.
Excellent!

We used Trader Joe’s Triblend rice and added red beans and left over grilled Cajun chicken cooked with a Carolina Reaper rub (very hot). The dish turned out amazing and cook times were perfect.

This recipe is GREAT! I made a few minor changes (a little more garlic, little less celery, couple added shakes of Cajun seasoning) and it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe Cindy!

I have made this dish twice in the last week because my husband is such a fan.  Since our son doesn't like shrimp, I used chicken along with the smoked sausage.  It's not too spicy, but that's perfect for our family.  I do make the rice separately (we use Minute Rice in the microwave) and add it in fully cooked.

UPDATED: I have now made this a few more times, and I find I really like using my Crock Pot.  I take 2 cups of chicken broth, seasonings (I double the amount of thyme and use a teaspoon of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, plus about a teaspoon of salt along with the garlic), the canned tomatoes with juice and all the raw, chopped vegetables and put them in my Crock Pot. Then I brown about a pound of smoked sausage and some chicken (since our son doesn't like shrimp).  I add the meat in the Crock Pot when browned and let it all cook on high for about 4 hours or on low 6-8 hours.  When done, I use 2 more cups of chicken broth and two cups of Minute Rice to make my rice in the microwave and add that to the Crock Pot, stir it all, then leave the lid off and put the heat on low for 15 to 30 minutes or until the rice absorbs the juices.  You can also add shrimp during that time, if you are using it, as I have done on nights it's just me and my husband.  Adjust seasonings (things always seem to need more salt when I make them in the Crock Pot) and serve.

I made this last week, the only differences was.... instead of tomato paste, I used Rotel original. I also placed the Dutch oven in the oven to keep from burning what’s at the bottom of the pot. Turned out perfect!

This recipe is awesome! The vegetables are cooked fully but still firm the shrimp, by adding them at the end keeps them soft instead of rubbery & overcooked, the flavor is outstanding! You make it in one pot it's easy as well as easy cleanup and it doesn't take a whole lot of time. I've made other jambalayas that take hours to prepare this one is fast easy and most importantly delicious I will be making this again thank you

My husband regularly asks me to make this dish. He loves it, and so do I! It takes a little bit of prep and babysitting, but totally worth it. The only thing I have to sub or play with now and then is they type of sausage I put in. My hubby and I tend to like things a little spicy, so I sub in keilbasa now and then.

The flavor is good but I had to triple or more the seasoning. I would also double the rice. There was a lot of liquid so I added more rice at the end.

I made this recipe but I used 2 teaspoons of the Cajun Spice recipe (also on AR) instead of the separate herbs in this and it turned out great.

Made the jambalaya for the first time with the spicy sausage and a little bit of store bought deli roasted chix. Looking forward to making it again but will use shrimp the next time. So much better than the boxed stuff.

This recipe was a good start, but it needed much more seasoning and spice to be a proper jambalaya.

Very good base! I added homemade rotisserie chicken and red beans. I used slap your mama Cajun seasoning. I used Italian style tomatoes. I’m a huge flavor person so I added more seasonings then suggested in recipe. Very good!

Love this one-pot recipe for a busy weeknight! If you buy the onion, bell pepper and celery already diced, it takes 30 min from start to finish. Sometimes I add cooked chicken breast as another protein and texture.

This was awesome!! We made it with a few tweaks however: added a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, skipped the bay leaves...then, after a few bits, we decided it needed tomato paste. Then it was BOMB!!! Will definitely be making this again soon!!

Very tasty and easy to prepare! Used prepackaged smoked turkey sausage, frozen uncooked shrimp but I didn’t have Cajun seasoning so I used Creole instead (not sure what the difference is so if anyone can educate me I’d love to know!) The full tsp of spice was too spicy for my family so next time I will use half the spice. Nevertheless it was a bit hit with my family and even my husband had seconds! Makes a good amount of food and leftovers are just as delicious. I always enjoy an opportunity to break out the cast iron Dutch Oven; if you don’t own one I highly recommend them! They can be used for a variety of things, both on stovetop and in oven, and are reasonably priced. I will definitely be keeping this recipe to use again-Thank you O.P for this delicious dish :)

This turned out so good! I used seafood stock instead of chicken stock and made a seafood jambalaya with shrimp, mussels and crab. That’s just what I had on hand but it turned out great.

1/2 tsp of seasoning isn’t nearly enough. I used about 5 TABLE SPOONS and that was nearly enough. Next time I’ll use 6.

This was good, easy, and flexible.  I did not want to run to the store so I used what I had on hand.  I substituted Costco's chicken apple sausage and a container of mirepoix from Trader Joes (which is just cut up celery, onion, and carrot).  For the green peppers, I substituted a red and yellow pepper that I had from one of those Costco pepper bags. Then for the tomatoes, I just used a cup of spaghetti sauce that I had on hand. Used a bag of raw shrimp with tails on from Trader Joe's and added more Cajun seasoning than was called for.  I did need to add extra water to make up for the lack of tomato juice but that was the only other adjustment that was not totally obvious.  This was yummy!

We enjoyed this recipe!  I used Andouille sausage and shrimp.  We like more seasoning so I used more than called for. I loved all the garlic!

Delicious and easy!  Added several habaneros cuz I love very spicy food and mushrooms cuz I had them on hand. All else per recipe and it was great!  The rice comes out a little mushy (like porridge) which I wasn't expecting, but it was great - including reheated leftovers for a few days.

This is my go-to base recipe for jambalaya. I like it hot and spicy so I use  twice the cajun seasoning, hot links (in addition to adouille and shrimp), and sometimes fire-roasted tomatoes with jalapenos.  I also substitute quinoa for rice (it takes a tad bit longer to cook than the rice) to make it a tad bit healthy.

I loved it.  I made it  really close to the recipe.  The only changes I made were I used a red bell pepper instead of green (due to GI issues) and used whole plum tomatoes instead of diced, which I cut up.  I also sauteed the rice in the fat with the veges before adding the liquids. I added some extra creole seasoning and some Frank's hot sauce.  The shrimp cooked quickly once added.  Probably only about 6-7 minutes.  Also, next time I'll check the rice after about 18 minutes it seemed a tad bit mushy.  Delicious meal!  Thank you.

I liked it although I made a few changes. Rather than using canned chicken broth, I boiled a chicken breast in about 1 1/2 pints of water, cut the breast into bite size and put all of it into the mix. I also used about a tablespoon (or a little more) because I like a little heat in my Jambalaya. I think it turned out Great!

Followed the recipe and it turned out great! Very delicious! I love spicy so I'd recommend adding a bit more Cajun seasoning to the jambalaya if you want more of a kick.

I used seasoned pork sausage, adjusted the amounts a little bit (28 oz can of tomato and a little extra rice because of the juice).  I had some leftover beef broth on hand so I used that instead of chicken.  Added a little extra spice (pepper and pepper flakes), and this dish was the perfect dinner.  Will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty and simple. Depending on your taste, you might want to add more cajun seasoning; I didn't think it was spicy enough with the amount in the recipe. Also, have extra chicken broth on hand if you plan on having leftovers; the rice soaks up the liquid overnight. Just keep leftovers in an oven-safe dish, add chicken broth and bake covered at 325 for 20-30 minutes to warm  up again.

Haven't had jambalaya in a long time and this recipe served as my fix for it. This is so much better compared to using a store bought mix! I used andouille sausage (first time I've been able to find it in a store) and seasoned 2 chicken breasts with s&p and garlic (cubed into 1" pieces, added to the dutch oven and cooked through). I prefer the smoked sausage over andouille and will use it next time. Omitted shrimp since I'm allergic to it. Used Cajun Spice Mix recipe from this site too (ended up adding an additional 1 tsp to this recipe). Used no salt added diced tomatoes. Sauteed the rice first before adding it in.  I felt more salt was needed (to taste), but husband thought it was perfect. End result was excellent for our taste and will be making this again! Thanks for sharing an easy to make Jambalaya recipe.

The main change I did on this recipe was I added chicken. With that said, I started the recipe with the chopped up chicken.  I also, did not add the rice during cooking, I like to start with rice in a bowl and then pour over the rice, more like a soup. I made this to bring into work and the quantities were dead on when the servings were changed, everyone loved it!!!!

Awesome!   Threw it all into a crock pot for 5.5 hours on low.   Used frozen bell peppers instead of fresh.  Used 2 chicken breasts and three hot Italian hot sausages.

I don't know what Cindy's saying I like it hot means .maybe she used a different Cajun seasoning brand but I could have easily used double the amount. Flavors were good. I used Johnsonville Andouille sausage .. don't it is just an expensive hot dog .. buy a decent sausage, I added boneless chicken thighs . Maybe some okra would be good to cross over into gumbo land. I served mine w/ yellow grits on the side.

Delicious! I've seen another recipe that adds chicken, but wanted to follow the recipe as written, except I omitted the celery.  Definitely will make again.

One of the better jambalaya recipes, although it really does need more cajun spice, as the recipe says, to taste! I didn't care for the ones with beef or worchestershire sauce. Made it with sausage, chicken, and shrimp.

My husband and I loved this. I forgot to buy chicken stock so substituted organic veggie broth.  We used Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning and also put tabasco on the finished product. We also used frozen, already cleaned USA shrimp. It didn't take any longer for frozen shrimp than for fresh and much easier!

All I have to say is awesome. First time making jambalaya and followed the recipe exact except I added a whole teaspoon of Cajun seasoning instead of just half. Thanks for a great recipe.

It's a keeper! Easy to make and clean up, and I like the "kitchen sink" concept. I used andoulie sausage, cooked chicken, shrimp and crumbled bacon on top. Great seasoning and easily adjusted from mild to hot.

This recipe is a family favorite. I've made it many times and always get compliments. It is even better the next day as leftovers. However, don't try to freeze it. I made extra once so I could put it in the freezer and have a quick meal at a later time. The rice ended up being way too mushy.

This was a nice simple recipe. Good flavour but a bit light on seasoning/heat. I just added more of the creole seasoning I made from this site and then some hot sauce when I served. Tasty though.  I did end up adding chicken breast, and some smoked chorizo as well as a few links of fresh andouille sausage for variety. Overall, a keeper, just needs more zip.

An excellent recipe and will have it again soon. Two small changes for myself was not using the green pepper for tummy reasons and I added a bit of calamari with the shrimp.

I must admit, I did add Chicken to the recipe. It was delicious. I made a huge pot that was nearly gone by the end of the night. I put out some cayenne pepper to add on top for those who like a bit of spice. I'll be sure to make this one again!

Always a big hit with my guys. I mostly follow this recipe as is using Uncle Ben's Rice. I feel it works better in rice dishes. Sometimes I add season chicken breast cut into cubes. Very flavorable. Since I'm feeding guys I also serve a side of Spicy Fried Wings. #delish

Due to needing low salt foods, I substituted Cayenne Pepper for the Cajun Seasoning.  I should have used half the amount (at least).  It was very spicy, but not inedible.  I used no salt chicken broth, added no extra salt, and used Turkey Kielbasa.  It was really good, just a little on the spicy side.

Super easy and delicious, I used bratwurst sausage and I think I used more shrimp.  
It re-heated really well and I will be making again to freeze for quick meals.

A lot of flavor here... Made a few changes.. Skipped the thyme leaves, added a lot more Cajun seasoning. Also added some cayenne pepper, hot sauce, and crushed red pepper (we like things spicy at my house)... Also added chicken. Was still a bit more soupy than I wanted so next time I would add more rice/ less chicken broth.

Wine pairing tip: Sauvignon Blanc, preferably from New Zealand. My new go-to Jambalaya recipe! Only additional tip is to brown the sausage, and cook rice in until it turns very white before adding liquid (something my grandma always did).

Like Cindy says, this is a very flexible recipe.  One change I make is to cook up a half a pound of cut-up bacon in the dutch oven in  lieu of olive oil.  I also add more cut up veggies than the recipe calls for, along with an additional 1/4 cup of rice.  Besides bacon my meats usually consist of andouille sausage, chicken pieces (sauteed in advance), and shrimp. Cindy's  spice/herb selection is spot on.

I added 1 1/2 tbs of chicken flavored bullion to give it more flavor.  I also added 1 cooked, shredded chicken breast when I added the tomatoes for a little more meat.  This is a really good recipe!

I used Italian sausage but followed the rest of the recipe. My family loved it I should have made a double batch!

This is one of the most successful dishes I've made in years.  Perfectly balanced flavor S and a great basic Creole dish.  You may call it something else but it is Creole!!  WOW

Delicious! My first time attempting jambalaya and this was so easy. Couldn't find Cajun seasoning at my local grocery store so I found a recipe for my own, added a little extra and everything turned out perfectly. Enough for us to have leftovers tomorrow for lunch too. Flavor is excellent, a little spice but not too much.

I liked this!   I had about 1.5 cups of homemade chicken bone broth that I wanted to use and I added a pint of homemade tomato juice - so I added a bit extra rice to soak up the extra liquid.   I also had scallops so I added those too, when I added the shrimp.   It was very good - just the right amount of spice for my family (I used the recipe for spice proportions).    I'll make this again!

When I am looking for recipes the main goal during the work week is that it's delicious, quick, and doesn't require a lot of dishes.  This recipe checks off all those requirements.  My husband loves it and I have been asked by others to provide them the recipe.

I left the rice out and used a little bit of cornstarch and water to thicken it, which made the Jambalaya like a hearty stew.  I then served it over a generous portion of cheesy grits with a warm slice of cornbread on the side. Everything was superb.

This was a good, easy recipe. I doubled the cajun seasoning and I thought it could use a little more (my husband added a lot more to his individual bowl, as well as some cayenne pepper). My 5 year old who eats any and everything actually didn't like the rice part, but ate the shrimp and sausage.

Although the jambalaya  was simple and tasty, the rice was definitely in way too long. It was mushy by the time I took it out instead of perfectly soft. I would recommend adding the shrimp in 10 minutes before the rice would be done (generally 5-10 minutes after you put it in) so that it stays in for just the right amount of time. Then the recipe would be perfect!

This was the first time I made jambalaya from scratch. It was a super easy recipe although I made a few minor changes. I used red pepper instead of green, doubled the seasoning (I would add even more next time) and added some cooked leftover chicken I had. I rounded out the meal with some corn muffins and a salad and it was fabulous. Plenty left over for another meal. It's a keeper!

Oh my goodness!!! Best jambalya recipe I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly, however, I did add red bell pepper (needed to use it), a can of rotel, the 7 Oz can of green chilis, lots of fresh garlic (I live garlic!), and green onions (once again had to use). My super picky 8 yr old son had 3 bowls! I will definitely make this over and over again! Thank you for sharing!

I thought this dish was really good. I however did not pay attention to how long it was going to take, so that was my bad. No offense to the reviewer who said that this was kind of a bland dish, but that had to be on your end of things in terms of how much of the spices you put in and the quality of the spices because ours turned out extremely flavorful. We like our foods on the spicy side of things so I added extra red pepper flakes and I blended my own Cajun mix based on a recipe found on the site.  Trust me I have gotten sawdust equivalent spices that are all smell and no taste. Quality of the spice is important.  Anyway, great dish and super easy to make especially for beginner/kitchen challenged individuals such as myself.  My husband loved it.

This was one of the best jambalayas I've ever made.  I halved the recipe (because there's just 2 of us) except that I used the whole can of tomatoes and a pound of shrimp.  I also sauteed the rice in about 1/2 tsp. of oil before adding it along with the tomatoes, etc.  I also made a simple shrimp stock with the  shrimp shells by cooking them in a small saucepan with a tablespoon of butter and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I reduced that to about 3/4 cup, strained it and added it to the jambalaya after the 20 minutes of cooking.  I liked that it wasn't real spicy, but quite tasty.   We both enjoyed it very much.  Thanks, Cindy, for a great recipe.

I used a pound of Andouille sausage and some extra cajun  seasoning and used brown rice instead. Delicious!

This is so good. I doubled the amount of chicken broth (I like my Jambalaya kinda soupy, but really, the rice absorbs almost everything) and I about tripled the Cajun spices. It was insanely good. I will do this again for sure!

Outstanding!!! The whole family loved it. I did have to substitute 1tsp of Garlic powder, instead of diced Garlic...because I was out. Also dialed back the Cajun seasoning just a tad, because I was using some rather spicy andouille sausage. Also used some large shrimp, which really made it. Turned out perfect, with some nice heat. Will absolutely make again.

It was ok. I will make it again but with modifications for sure. Good base to begin with. All the mushy is what my issue is. I need more texture to suit me.

I'm not a huge fan of spice, so I was nervous to try this recipe. But it was delicious! Smoky, with a tiny hint of spice. Next time, I may add more sausage. But, only because my family likes it a lot!

I really liked this recipe.  My kids are not into spicy food so this recipe allowed me to give it flavour with the herbs, and we added hot sauce at the table to each taste.  Very quick and easy weeknight meal.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was fantastic! I did add some okra, and a little more chicken broth just to make it soupy, and I used Emeril's Creole seasoning...perfect. Just the right amount of heat, very flavorful and so good on a cold winter's night.

Love this recipe it's a staple for my family now. I use quinoa instead of rice.  I also add chicken and more sausage but that is only because my husband eats a lot and that way it's more filling and we have leftovers. My family doesn't like anything too spicy so this is perfect. If you like more heat I suggest you add cayenne pepper. Thank you Cindy for sharing!

This is very good, though it definitely needs hot sauce.  A vinegary hot sauce like Crystal or Tabasco is your best bet.  When I am trying to be healthier, I use Andouille chicken sausage (not as flavorful but lower in fat and calories).  Also, don't steam the seafood too long--especially if you have smaller pieces of shrimp.  Sometimes I make this with scallops and calamari, but I prefer large shrimp.

I pretty much followed this recipe, except I didn't add shrimp.  It was already protein heavy, so I didn't see the point.  I used the shrimp in a pasta dish the next night. ;-)

I changed a few things. I didn't add the sausage, onion, celery, or salt and I was heavy in the creole seasoning. I also used chicken  that was boiled in seasoning and prawns. It was fantastic! Thank you for providing a great basis for me to create my own dish! ;)

Super simple recipe that turned out splendidly! I'd say to throw in a lot more meat. And whatever meat you choose, it should be seasoned to match the dish.

Loved this spicy dish!  Used beef hotdogs stuffed with jalapenos and cheddar instead of sausages and added a small can of diced chilies.  No need for the cajun spice b/c of the spice in the dogs. Added a little garlic powder, chili and onion powder.  Followed recipe and it was great. We farm and raise alot of our own meats and veges. Rest we try to purchase at farm markets or organic and I think the better quality gives superb flavor. For those that were alittle dissapointed try again and avoid your typical grocery store. Your taste buds will thank you and so will your wallet b/c you won't buy unneccesary junk .

Liked/Loved it. I added an extra half cup of rice and did not need to add extra liquid. In the end this made 7 servings with the extra rice added and extra chicken added. I also used the cajun spice recipe from this site. All in all I will make this again.

Very good! Will definitely make it again. We would have liked it a little more spicy. Also, the rice was not completely cooked and maybe should be cooked prior to adding it in. We added crab too!

Je voudrais une chose. Faire revenir le riz jusqu'à ce qu'il blanchisse. Ajoutez ensuite les trucs humides. Cela rendra le grain de riz pour le grain. Je suis de la Nouvelle-Orléans, et voilà comment j'ai appris. Autres sages. Droit

This was super easy and super yummy!  I didn't have any shrimp on hand, so I ended up adding 1 1/2 lbs of turkey keilbasa.  I was really surprised with how rich it tasted.  The only thing I would change is to double it.  It only ended up being about four servings since this was the only thing served for the meal.  This is a great, fairly quick meal to throw together on a busy night!

We used this recipe with our leftovers from our low-country boil the night before. IT WAS DELICIOUS! It was a hit with everyone and was great with some crusty bread. We will definitely make this again. We did ultimately use a lot more seasoning, but all of us are in to super spicy food. Great recipe!

This was my first time making Jambalaya. I picked this recipe because it seemed pretty straight forward. I read most of the reviews before hand and made 2 changes. I used a little more Cajun seasoning and I sautéed the rice before adding the wet ingredients. It was amazing! The best recipe I've made from this site, and I've made a lt. I will add this to my recipes I make often!!

my family loved this but we also used 1/2 a jar of Cajun seasoning...  this is flavorless without cajun seasoning..  Grant Michel's Easy Cajun Jambalaya was much better..

I'm only giving this 3 stars because the rice seems to be a major problem. Mine took so long to soften that it added almost an hour to the recommended time. The flavor is great though! I added 1/2 can of beer, a few dashes of Worcestershire, and some Louisiana hot sauce to add a little zing. Next time I will just cook the rice on the side and add it towards the end.

Didn't change a thing. Used leftover meat from a crab boil. It's amazing! I agree with sautéing the rice until white...use more oil if you need to. I love this!! I try to eat low carb and this isn't too bad in carbs, but SO worth it!!

Left out the celery.  Don't like it in my soups.  And I didn't have green bell pepper (to lazy to go to store for one item) so used the  grilled sweet red peppers I had.  Also added some chicken.  The rest of the recipe was the same.  Came out great!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  I love this site.  Even if I don't follow the recipe exactly I always get great ideas for food.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except left out the bay leaves, and omitted the salt because I sprinkled in extra Cajun seasoning and it had salt in it already. This is delicious! It's also easy and uses one pot. I made one mistake: didn't notice my frozen shrimp were unpeeled. So we had peel em and eat em jambalaya. Fortunately it was just us! Love it.

Fantastic! Cooked 2 slices bacon set aside and crumble, add to top before serving. Cook sausage and veggies in bacon fat and bit of oil as directed. Also added 1C chopped, cooked chicken, 1C cooked ham, cubed, same time as shrimp. Super yummy!!

Simple to follow -- helped me when I was in a bind with just a few ingredients at home. I only had eight frozen shrimp and no celery, but it turned out just fine. Recipes like this one are the best -- easy to adapt and easy to make!

I made this pretty much according to the recipe and we really enjoyed the outcome.  I tripled the recipe and plan to freeze some of it.  It didn't turn out red at all like most of the jambalayas I've seen...maybe because of the sausage (kielbasa) I used?  I used Old Bay as the Cajun seasoning.

I have made this recipe several times now.  It is great!  I use 12 ounces of andouille cajun chicken sausage instead and also use diced tomatoes with green chilies.  A few have mentioned the lack of spices so I add extra as well as more garlic (but we love garlic in my family) and some onion powder.  I did not have cajun seasoning this past time so I added some paprika and oregano as well as a touch of cayenne pepper.  As far as cooking it is concerned, I let everything simmer without the shrimp for about 35 minutes because 20 minutes was not enough for the rice to cook.  Once the shrimp was in it only took about another 10 minutes.

I made this today and it was amazing. I followed another persons advice and used Rotel tomatoes with green chili and added some hot sauce to add more spice. I also added half a bag of frozen okra and half a bag of frozen vegetables. I used jalapeño sausage and shrimp and it was awesome!!  I used creole seasoning  and Old Bay seasoning. Loved Cindy's recipe and will make this again.   So delicious!!!

The Conecuh sausage makes this recipe. I am from Missouri and that is not sold up here so a couple of times a year when I am in Alabama or Florida I stock up on the sausage. Good Stuff!!!!

I had never made jambalaya before, but had some leftover cooked cilantro lime shrimp from Costco, and some leftover cooked brown rice, so I fed shrimp and rice into the ingredients search and came up with this.  So easy and flexible!  I had no green pepper, celery, sausage, or cajun seasoning, but added in some ham, Old Bay seasoning, and chipotle chili pepepr seasoning.  Great meal!

I made this recipe using brown rice and turkey sausage for a more healthy dish. I added twice the Cajun seasoning as the turkey sausage is not as flavorful.Was a big hit at dinner time served with a green salad.

Great flavor. Be careful of what type of rice you use..all I had in my cupboard was basmati - took a significantly longer time and more liquid to cook than recipe said. Otherwise, quick to prepare and tasty!

I've made this almost a dozen times and it is always delicious. The only changes I made are to use brown rice and chicken instead of shrimp. This is easy, fairly cheap to make, and so so good. Even my two year old has seconds. :)

Simple recipe with great taste, I did have to add a lot more cajun seasoning. I also added extra chicken bullion, basil, a tbs of butter, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for some added zest. Turned out great, I couldn't stay out of it!

I'm a college student on a tight budget and I have extremely picky eaters as roommates, I made this dish for myself one night expecting to have left overs to last me the rest of the week, but I was wrong. As soon as my roommates walked in and smelled the aroma of what I was cooking they literally inhaled this awesome dish!! Seriously the BEST I've had homemade. I've been to New Orleans many times and this is just as great!

Never had jambalaya before and I thought this was good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used frozen shrimp so I added them at the end for only about 2 mins to get them hot.

Huge hit at our house!  The tip to saute the rice prior to adding to the mix worked like a charm.  I used old bay so as to not get the "heat" for my little people. Also since I was without shrimp I used imitation crab (I know I'm making people cringe)as well as left over turkey. I love how adding the sausage to the olive oil before adding the trinity gave the dish amazing depth!  Thank YOU!!

Did everything exactly as was written (though I may have been a little heavy-handed with the garlic). This was SO GOOD. It will be a new staple in our house for sure. It was flavorful without being too spicey for my 3 and 5 year old. My husband and I topped our servings off with a little extra Cajun seasoning. SO GOOD! I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

This was a huge hit! I added 2 cans of chicken broth because about 10 mins before it was done I added white instant rice and precooked shrimp.. it turned out PERFECT! Oh, I also used the Cajun seasoning from this site. I cubed up frozen chicken and cooked with the sausage. I only used 1 bay leaf too. Thank you, I had never made Jambalaya before.

Delicious delicious and very easy to make. A few changes out of curiosity and what I had handy: 1) added chicken 2) added half a can of cream of shrimp soup (from another version of this recipe. Only reason I did that was because I didn't know such a thing existed and I had to try it), 3) added a jalapeño pepper, 4) used up some chicken/mango sausage I had left over instead of smoked and 5) used brown rice. I will definitely make this again and try adding some other goodies! Thanks for a great one!

I made this the other night by the recipe posted here. We loved it only I do wish I had added a little more Cajan Spice. I also used a boil n bag rice to save some time. I would make it again only next time I would make it spicier. Thanks for sharing.

Amazing recipe, very simple, and I love the "one pot" cooking. I made it for a pot luck dinner and it surpassed my expectations for easiness and flavour! I think it is important to use good quality flavourful sausage. As one reader mentioned, make sure that the rice is well coated before adding the liquids. Also, white basmati rice is flavourful and keeps the shape well.
Thank you Cindy and the fellow reviewers. I will make this meal again and I recommend it as a pot-luck or just a nice "lazy" menu. It did not even take me an hour to prepare.

This is awesome and so easy to make! I've made it several times now and I love it even more with each time I make it. I plan on making it this weekend for my mom. I have added some tomatoes with diced chiles to give it a little more kick.

The first time I made this the rice never fully cooked and was crunchy....  
I cooked the rice separately and then add it to the mixture at the end now and it turns our great every time! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I tried this recipe the other day and it was delicious! Very easy and simple to-do, and the flavors were great. My boyfriend loved it and we both had the leftovers for lunch the next day!

This was good. I forgot the garlic and didn't have celery and added chopped ham from another recipe and a half cup of beer to the liquid. I kind of just winged it, but based on this recipe and it was delicious.

Delicious!  I added chicken (sauteed until cooked through before adding sausage), and followed another reviewer's advice regarding the rice- sauteed it until it all turned white BEFORE adding the chicken broth and tomatoes.  Created my own creole seasoning and added twice as much of it as the recipe called for.  For my fiance, who's a spice wuss, this was too spicy, but for me it was perfect! :)

This was so good and easy to make...family couldn't believe how fast dinner was ready.  Followed recipe, but subbed dry spices (1/2 the amount of the fresh spices), as I usually do.  Would not change a thing...delicious!!!

Delicious!  I used about 1/8 tsp cajun seasoning so it wasn't too spicy at all.  It was very mild.  I used about 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of minced garlic and a little sprinkling of onion powder.  Didn't have to add much salt at all.  Omitted the celery.  Had to add some more chicken broth and diced tomatoes towards the end because all of my rice had soaked it up.  Keep checking it after rice has been added in so it doesn't scorch.   Add wet stuff after rice starts to turn white. YUM!

Excellent and super easy!  I'm not a big fan of making rice so anytime I can incorporate it into a dish that's great!  I was in a super rush - I used fully cooked andouille sausage and fully cooked southwestern style chicken strips.  Added chicken at the end just to heat through.  You would never know the sausage wasn't simmering all day.  Phenomenal - I also did not use the green pepper as my family is not a big fan of green peppers.   Shrimp was frozen - so next time I'll skip the chicken.

Easy to prepare and nice flavor! I would reduce rice next time, as it was more than I would've liked... I brought the cajun seasoning to the table and I added more to my dish, but my bf thought it was just fine the way it was prepared.

Congrats to Cindy...this is an AWESOME recipe!!! I used jumbo (10-15 count) brown shrimp -- which are sweeter, according to the butcher -- and andouille sausage. Doubled the recipe and shared with my neighbors...it was a total hit! My butcher even requested a copy of the recipe. I am making this recipe again soon!

LOVE the recipe as a basic jambalaya recipe to start getting creative from but wanted to make this with sweet potatoes instead of shrimp (way cheaper) and put the sausage on top, not in the mix.  Here are the changes I made:
- I also added 1/2 cup extra rice as someone mentioned and added an additional cup and half of chicken broth. I wish I would have added another can of diced tomatoes and will do that next time whether I add the extra rice and broth or not.
- I doubled the spices having read that the recipe as written was too mild for many. It was just right and not too spicy for crowd of 8. We had leftovers as the extra rice probably wasn't necessary. But yay for leftovers!
- I added 2 pounds (2 large) sweet potatoes- peeled and cubed in  1/2 to 3/4 inch squares when I added the broth. The 20 minutes was just enough for them to cook to perfect firmness.
- I pan fried 13 oz (2 large) Johnsonville Andouille sausages after cutting in 1/4 inch slices until very browned on both sides of each slice. I served these on top of the dish like my local cajun place does it.
I was asked for the recipe by those in attendance so I think it turned out well! Thanks Cindy for the recipe!

I have made this recipe and like it. I did end up modifying it. I used crushed tomatoes, omitted the celery, used low fat turkey kielbasa, 1\2 lb of shrimp, omitted the thyme and added a bit of basil and parsley instead. I cooked the shrimp, kielbasa and pepper with the oil first , then added tomatoes and chicken broth and spices. I pre-cooked the rice before I started the sausage\shrimp\pepper mix & that cut down on the simmering time. The rice went in last.  I also wanted to make sure that the rice didn't soak up all the juices from the tomatoes etc and leave it not moist enough. Then I simmered for approx 5 minutes to let all the flavors meld together and it was completed. VERY GOOD.

This was excellent.  I changed the tomatoes to two large fresh tomatoes and and added some ham that I had left over.  I also had 8 scallops in the freezer that I added while it simmered.  Because I didn't use the canned tomatoes with juice, I punched the whole thing up with 3/4 of a cup of pinot noir that I had left over...delish!  Thanks for sharing!

This was so good! I doubled the Cajun spice and found it just right for my husband and myself, but my daughter who doesn't like spicy found it too spicy. I also used brown rice, partially cooked since it's cooking time is longer.

Oh boy, was this ever good! Like many reviewers, I chose Cindy's version because it was virtually a "one pot" recipe (which I love)! I used smoked turkey sausage, browned really well. I found myself without bell pepper, so I subbed a small zucchini, diced, instead. I also omitted the celery, as I don't care for it. I cheated a tad and used the 10-minute boil in a bag rice, which I threw in a few minutes before serving. I also used a bag of cooked shrimp (tails off) and tossed those in about 3 minutes before we ate....just enough to warm up the shrimp and get a good coating of the yummy flavors in this dish. Next time, I'd only use one bay leaf, but other than that, I can see that this will be a regular meal during the fall/winter months. Delicious, easy, and satisfying....I've hit the trifecta! Thank you, Cindy!

It was good just I felt it needed more spice as it was a kind of sweet Jambalaya. I would probably make again but use spicier sausage and Cayenne pepper.

My sister made this for me using grd Italian sausage and it was very very good. I followed the recipe but used fresh thyme and chicken instead of Prawns and tripled the spice (we like heat)......My husband ate three servings and Wooza....it is so good and easy to make. This is a winner

Followed recipe as written. It wasn't quite spice enough. Maybe next time I will use Rotel tomatoes to zing it a bit.

This was my first time trying Jambalaya.  I was very good.  I used Lean Turkey Kielbasa though.  But it came out good. The only thing is that the rice was cooked a littile uneven, and im not sure why.
