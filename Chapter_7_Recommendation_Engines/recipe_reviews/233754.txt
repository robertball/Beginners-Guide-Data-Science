I followed the recipe exact, only using REAL bacon bits because I don't ordinarily keep vegetarian bacon on hand and omitting the sugar because we don't care for sweet salads. This is one of the best broccoli salads we have had in a long time. I especially loved the combination of broccoli and cauliflower and there was just enough of everything (bacon, cheese, dressing) without being overwhelming. GREAT salad!

This is AWESOME!  I followed the recipe except I used real bacon and I also subbed sour cream for plain yogurt.  So wonderfully yummy!  Will definitely be making this one again.

Delicious! I cut the sugar in half and I used a scant quarter teaspoon of salt. I used Morningstar Farms veggie bacon, and there was plenty of salty flavor.

This was so good. Did not have cauliflower so I used what I had in the house. Celery,avocado, cranraisins,slivered almonds, red pepper, and of course the broccoli, purple onion and the delicious dressing. I think you can add anything and it will be delicious. My guests loved it.

Great for a picnic! I used a food processor to shred my cheese and chop my veggies for a super quick prep. Subbed simulated bacon bits to taste (lots!) and low fat sour cream for the yogurt. Delish!
