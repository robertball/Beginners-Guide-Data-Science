This is a great recipe.  I double the recipe so that I could have some to pop into a toaster.  Only change was use 2/4 cup of 35% milk and 1 1/14 cup 2% milk as I did not have enough 2% in the house.  Worked great will be making again.

Nice little recipe - and since I'm a fan of both pancakes and french toast, I had to give this a try. And, while I did up the amount of vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg overall these turned out really good. This is definitely a nice twist on two classic breakfast dishes. Great topped with butter and real maple syrup and served with some OJ and fresh fruit.

I doubled the recipe which yielded 14 pancakes with my #50 scoop. I omitted the salt and used melted butter for the oil in the batter, I used a non stick griddle so I just lightly sprayed with Pam. My kids enjoyed these but I found the aftertaste a bit odd, can\t put my finger on what it is.

I've been looking for this for YEARS, when I was a child a pancake house had these and never could find it again. I tweaked a little I used 1 tablespoon of baking soda for fluffier pancakes, doubled cinnamon and added a few splashes of vanilla extract. when I wanted them thinner again I added 2 tablespoons of cold water and cooked on a medium-low heat so they didn't look burnt.

This is my fav pancake recipe so far. The test is Devine and texture is on point. If you remove the "French Toast" spices you have a nice pancake. It's now the only recipe I follow. With or without the spices. Two thumbs up!! ????????

These were delicious, I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of   castor sugar, we had no white, and a tablespoon of brown sugar as well as extra nutmeg and cinnamon (didn't measure just added till it looked good) served with whipped cream and maple syrup it was awesome! Definitely will be making this again!

I love French toast and I love pancakes! I was very excited when I found this recipe. Very good! Something could be better about it but I'm not quite sure what it is yet. Will try tweaking it just a little bit next time.

Great pancakes. Really good flavor with the added spices. Nothing like French toast except for the flavor. Still searching for the perfect pancake recipe. This one is very close. Texture is great but not perfect

I tweaked the recipe a little and thE whOle famity lover it.  My wife is gluten free, so I used gluten free flour as well as utilizing more of it then asked. I also used a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was a bit to watery at the start and the added flour thickened it up nice.  The flavor was great. Like others stated, they came out a little flat. But hit the spot nicely.  Well done.

This didn't do it for us. The spices were a cute twist, but the very low sugar content made the pancaked almost savory. They also came out very flat, although the texture was nice. Not bad, but not particularly good either.

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical as I read this recipe as to how it would taste like french toast with a "dash' of cinnamon and vanilla.  While it's a bit of a stretch, there were definitely bites reminiscent of french toast (though, I did add a health "dash" of both cinnamon and vanilla and skipped the nutmeg).  They had a nice cinnamon-y taste.  This made 2 large pancakes and 2 medium sized pancakes.  For my second pancake, I added some chocolate chips as I'm a big cinnamon/chocolate fan.  That was nice, too.  THANKS for the recipe!
