This recipe makes a very good, low sugar, not-too
sweet muffin. I did not have the amaranth or brown
rice flour, so substituted 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill
Buttermilk Pancake & Waffle Mix.  Also sprinkled 
cinnamon sugar on top before baking. Next time I'll make it with more rhubarb and no strawberries
just because I like rhubarb a lot!

Needs more strawberries and some sugar.  used Bisquick instead of the amaranth and brown rice flours.

Healthy. Moist. I added more strawberries and rhubarb. Also used coconut flour instead of amaranth. I did not use vegetable oil as that is not healthy, I used coconut oil instead. Next time I will add some milk or cream to thin it out a bit more.

I was not impressed with these muffins, at all...i can't say they were bad because the taste was decent.  but they did not rise at all and were like little, dry, unsweetened lumps in the pans.

These muffins seem a little too bland for my liking.  Next time I think I would add more fruit.

These muffins are very good, but they turned out a little dry.  I didn't have the flours this recipe called for, so I substituted some whole grain pancake flour I had in the house.  I also added a little sprinkle of brown sugar on top.  Next time, I will add a little more rhubarb and strawberries.

Dry and not a lot of flavor.... I Doubled the strawberry and rhubarb and added some more honey. It was better but I still spread jam in it.
