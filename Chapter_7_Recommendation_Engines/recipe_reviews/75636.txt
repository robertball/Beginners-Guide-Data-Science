WOW!!! My husband and I are addicted to hot wings...usually once a week, we drive about 25 miles one way to a certain restaurant to get a big bucket. It usally runs about 40 bucks. Now that I have this recipe, no more driving for wings. The only thing I did different, was after cooking the hot sauce, garlic & peppers, I pureed everything in the blender. Not for anyone with a heart condition though. Thanx for a SUPER wing recipe!!!

AMAZING! I am a Yankee and my fiance is from the south. He can eat fire and still say it is just warm. These were hot for him, REALLY HOT! Thank you for the recipe, I will use this again for sure!

Oh my, sooooo good! Huge hit! I couldn't find the Thai peppers, so I left them out.  Still only used the portions of the other peppers. Also, I just baked them in oven, instead of broiling. If you like hot wings and you like them hot this is your recipe.

If you ever want to see a bald-headed man sweat, fix these.  It is a little time consuming but the end result is worth it.  I have been requested to fix these so many times that I do it from memory now.  I had to warn my people that they could not be a SISSY and eat these.  LOL

Thankyou so much for a recipe that we both can appreciate. My husband usually eats 5 alarm wings but unfortunately they don't have the taste included, just the heat.I usually pass on them. Yours however have both. Our hats off to you for a great and tasty wing recipe.

Finding the peppers in winter in northern New England is a challenge but well worth the effort!  Instead of deep frying, I broiled my plain wings for 1/2 hour and then placed them in a deeper pan.  All of the seeded peppers and hot sauce and butter went into the blender and then poured over the wings.  They went into the fridge overnight.  I cooked them at 350° until they were heated through and the sauce was bubbly.  Wicked yummy slow burn kind of heat! :)

Great recipe. Although, not nearly hot enough. For those who want something hot, use this recipe & double or triple the amount of peppers used. My husband & I made this & had to triple the amount of peppers & added habanero pepper powder. It's nice & hot.

Made as directed except I did run the sauce through a food processor, these are the best hot wings! I was worried they were going to be unbearable to eat so I only put 3/4 of the total amount of peppers the recipe called for. It came out perfect. Everyone loved it.  Easy to make, highly recommended.

Won "Best Hot Wings" at a recent chili cookoff with these wings.  Didn't use the Thai peppers, but used serranos instead, more accessible in our garden.  Great flavor, lots of heat but not too overwhelming that you can't enjoy them.  Thank you so much for sharing this!!!!  Can't wait to make them again!!!

Soooo yummy!  Great flavor and I am going to use this as a marinade for grilling too.  Serve with a sour cream based dipping sauce for those who will be needing a fire extinguisher!

This was a good sauce, I put all the ingreidents in a food processor and reduced on the stove. Then mixed drained wings in. Was easy to do.

Andy, you succeeded in making my husband & son eat their words. They dared me to make super hot wings & didn't think I could do it. HA! I showed them. I had to sub a couple of the peppers for what we had available here but it worked perfectly! Thank you!!

My son can't get enough of this recipe! It is exceptional. I double the amount of garlic and purée the sauce in a blender as suggested by another reviewer. This is definitely a keeper!

These were awesome!!Could have been hotter, though. Made homemade blue cheese dip to go along with them. Fabulous.
