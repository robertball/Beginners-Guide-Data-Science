Green Goddess was my mother's favorite salad dressing, and she got me hooked on it.  After I could no longer find it in grocery stores, I thought that wonderful dressing was gone forever.  I have been delighted with this dressing every time I've made it.  It brings back wonderful memories of my mother, good times, and family dinners.  My friends have enjoyed this dressing and when I don't make it, they ask me where it is in the selection of dressings at my house.  This is most definitely worth the 5 stars I give it!

This is very, very good! It tastes so bright and fresh. I did alter the recipe: I doubled the parsley and chives and add garlic and cracked black pepper. They mayo has a strong flavor so I've found it's best to make it with 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt. This is a great dip for carrots, cucumber, grape tomatoes and pumpernickel bread (I usually cut up pumpernickel bagels).

I use lowfat mayo and the whole family loves it. I've never seen my fiance have seconds on salad before. We call it "Skinny Goddess" and it has become a staple. *Hint:  Don't mention the anchovies until after they go nuts over it.

This was pretty good. I added a splash of milk to thin it out a touch. One thing: The description says garlic is included, but it's not mentioned in the actual recipe.

5 stars, because it is delicious and also...if you don't want to eat anchovies; don't make this dressing. OR you could be a vegetarian, and JUST leave out the anchovies.

Very tasty recipe...my husband actually ate all his salad for once. I did add about 3/4 cup  of milk to thin it out because the original recipe had the thickness of a dip rather than a dressing.

This was excellent. Made for a goddess like me! LOL added a tsp of chopped garlic. Tastes the best the next day.Made again using 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream and added 1 tsp worcestershire sauce. You can substitute anchovy paste 1-2 tsp for the anchovies.

I'm just now starting to explore making homemade recipes.  BAM! Won't be buying this one in a jar again!  Awesome!  Now I did personally add garlic powder to it and a little dash of milk to thin it out.  Thank you so much for sharing this!

i've done this twice now and have made a couple small changes. first i want to say this is much better done in a blender. i also doubled the parsley and chives as another suggested to cut the mayo taste a little. lastly although i'm sure it can be eaten in an hour it is much much better 2-3 days later if you have that time

Tasty! I'll be making my own variation of this recipe often. The recipe as given might make a wonderful dip, but I felt it was far too thick to use as a dressing over greens and other miscellaneous fresh veggies, which was my intention.  First I added a little extra vinegar, along with the olive oil from the canned anchovies. That was still too thick, so I added some milk. The result was a dressing we thoroughly enjoyed. However, we both thought we'd like a more distinct anchovy taste, rather than just the subtle hint with the current amount. So next time I'll likely double the anchovies.

4 anchovies was way too overpowering my family and friends agree that when I made it with 1 anchovy it was the best tasting.

Not to my taste at all. The fatty oily fish and fatty oily mayo combine to make this way too heavy to pair with salad imo… Think I will try a dressing with much "lighter" ingredients in the future.

First time making this and it's wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly except for the tarragon vinegar. I used red wine vinegar as a substitute. Used all fresh ingredients and it's so delicious! Made it in a magic bullet.

As in the past (many years ago), I used anchovy paste!  It's less oily and the taste is lighter.  I also thin the mayo with a small amount of plain yogurt, and it covers the salad much easier.
