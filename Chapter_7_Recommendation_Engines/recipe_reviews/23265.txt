Great recipe! This pasta is good warm or cold. I marinated about 3 cups of cherry tomatoes that I cut in half lengthwise, cut the olive oil down to 1/4 cup, used 1/4 cup of finely chopped red onion and doubled the amount of fresh basil.  I added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes, a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes, and a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar.  I let everything marinate along with the garlic, salt and pepper for a few hours at room temp. Boiled some penne pasta then tossed it with the feta and parmesan.  This was a meal all in itself, but was a great side dish for some grilled italian marinated chicken.

I really loved this.  It was so good I could hardly stop eating!  I used Trader Joe's multi-grain flax spiral pasta, and chose to sautee the onion a few minutes.  I left the garlic raw, however, as I enjoy that flavor.  I added a little more fresh basil and an extra tomato too.  I cut down on the oil by 2 TBS, and added two splashes of red wine vinegar.  I loved how the feta tasted with all the ingredients.  Great recipe!!

This recipe was excellent with fresh garden tomatoes.  I rolled and sliced the basil, and added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to the tomato mixture.  Since this was more tasty the next day, The next time I let the mixture marinade over night in the fridge, heat just to room temp, and then serve over pasta.

This recipe is light and delicious.  I made a few changes.  I sauteed the garlic and onions in the olive oil.  I then added 1 pint of grape tomatoes, added salt and pepper,  and let them cook until they started to burst.  This really adds a punch and thickens the sauce a little.  I rolled the basil leaves up together and julienned them instead of leaving them whole and added this to the tomato mixture.  I let this sit until I cooked the pasta.  I drained the pasta and ran cold water over it to get it to room temperature.  Put the pasta in a bowl and added the Parmesan Cheese.  I buy marinated feta cheese from a local stand.  Mix the parmesan and feta with the pasta and then add the tomato mixture.  Very tasty!

I substituted one cup of cut-up sundried tomatoes (more expensive but much more flavorful) for the fresh diced tomatoes and used LOTS of torn fresh basil leaves.  Everyone LOVED the salad at the BBQ and many wanted the recipe.  The leftovers were delicious for lunch the next day warmed up in the microwave.

How can you ever go wrong with tomato and basil? I used cubes of mozzarella instead of parmesan or feta, added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, and some crushed red pepper flakes. It was delicious!

We love this recipe.  Even my children who are known to be picky at times gobble it right up.  I use grape tomatoes halved,  green onion along with white onion, probably more garlic than it calls for and add extra parmesan.  I prefer it warm rather than cold, but it is good cold if you add a little red wine vinegar.  Have made it for company and family and they love it too and have asked for the recipe!  Now a regular side dish at our house!

I added chopped italian parsley (from my garden) and you could saute' vidalia onions and the basil and italian parsley with and sugar snap peas and some finely sliced zucchini (I used my mandolin) it really enhances the flavor and the texture.  I added a splash of balsamic vinegar too.  Yummy!  I find my garden the creator of most of my summer meals.  Throw items in that are ready to be picked and viola! you have a new dish.  Its been a hot summer, so it's nice to have some cold leftovers that are ready to munch.  I doubled the recipe so I could have more refrigerated and ready after a long day and commute.  Thank you Angela!  :>D

I took the suggestion of others and lightly sauted the onion, garlic and then the basil.  I also substituted sun-dried tomatoes for regular tomatoes.  It was very good and I will try again.  It would work well for a picnic - a step up from the usual boring macaroni salad.  Next time I think I will give regular tomatoes a try.

I've read a lot of reviews in which the lack of flavor or nutrition is a concern. I thought the dish was decent, but nothing that stood out. But here are some ideas that might give people what they're looking for. I made it a second time with these adjustments, and it was very good. I added pitted and chopped Kalamata olives which gave a nice savory bite and boosted flavor. I took a handful of grape tomatoes, cut each in half, sprinkled w/Na+ & olive oil then roasted. This brought out the natural sugars & gave the dish more dimension. I also added a small pkg of baby spinach and wilted it within the dish while everything was still hot. This adds tons of nutrition, and adds color and flavor as well. I also used herbed feta which of course boosts the flavor. I'm also thinking that using a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes would lend even more flavor and depth. Dry herbs are generally more flavorful than fresh, so that's something to keep in mind. Dried basil would be more flavorful than fresh. I would also leave out the fresh onion, it is too pungent to taste good and I personally don't think it's necessary and adds nothing but a strong onion flavor & an odd crash of textures that don't go well together. Something to think about......  :)

A classic (minus the feta and onion) I refer to often, particularly in summer when basil and tomatoes are plentiful and at their best.  I add all ingredients "to taste."

Outstanding.  Perfect for a hot, humid pre-summer day.  I had some pesto I had to use up, so my only change was to substitute 3 heaping T of pesto in place of the basil (made a half recipe).  Used roma tomatoes and sweet onion which I let marinate in olive oil and pesto for about an hour.  Quick, easily, and totally devine.  Served with a tossed salad and garlic bread. Thanks so much for recipe! UPDATE:  We were out of feta cheese, but hubby wanted this dish again so I roasted some veggies and turked it into a sort of Pasta Primavera.  Delish!

Yummy!  I used tomatoes fresh from the garden and minced garlic.  I sautéed the onion garlic and basil.  Next time I could use a little more basil.  I shredded the basil leaves.  Definitely a keeper for a side dishonor summer pasta dinner.  My hubby loved it and it was so easy to make!

I prepared this with bowtie pasta, and since I did not have any fresh basil, I used dried.. I sauteed the onion and garlic, and only put 5 tblspoons of olive oil in it.. I thought it was very good, and my daughter (she is 6) thought it was great too! My husband did not like it at all (that is why I rated it a 4).  Next time I make this (when he is out of town LOL) I will add some wine to it for just a bit more flavor.. I really liked it as is, but I think that will give it that finishing touch.. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Eh, nothing special. Chef Hubby & Chef Son thought it was too bland. I'll probably look for another recipe that will cater to their 'snobby' palates better! A good starter recipe for newbies, though.

I have been serving a variation of this dish for some years. I add some roasted some halved or quartered plum tomatoes that have seeded, tossed with garlic and olive oil for 45 minutes at 200 degrees. I keep them in the fridge to add to this and other dishes

This was outstnding and I can't wait to make it again.  Used our own fresh summer tomatoes plus i added some fresh chopped green pepper and a couple of banana peppers - all growing in our garden along with the fresh basil. It was SUPER-DELICIOUS and the fragrant sauce made the house smell like a good Italian restaurant....mmmmmm. A great dish to make for company with a loaf of warm Tuscan bread.

This is quite good, but of course, I did make some changes. First, I lightly sauteed the onion and minced garlic in about three tablespoons of olive oil. (I think the recipe calls for way too much oil, so I cut it down by about half.) When they were almost finished sauteing I added the tomatoes to warm them through, then removed it from the heat and stirred in the basil, which I chopped medium fine.
If you're not a fan of feta cheese, other cheeses will work just as well, just use your favorite. I love that this dish works equally well as a warm/room temp dish or a chilled one the next day. I do have to say, I preferred it chilled. Yum!

Very good, made with cannned diced tomatoes and dried basil and minced garlic, followed a tip to soak dried herbs before using them so I got a fresh basil taste from the dried. Put it with angel hair pasta and was a delicious twist on pomodoro. I will continue to use it regularly. Next time with fresh tomatoes and herbs. Oh yes, I added about a teaspoon balsamic vinegar to it for a little more kick.

Awesome, can decrease olive oil a little but delicious meal. I made mine with whole wheat bow tie pasta and loved it! I also added sun dried tomatoes since I was a little short on the fresh tomatoes and it was incredible. So simple and easy.

This is one of my go to's when I don't feel much like cooking...I make one alteration.  Try slow roasting the tomatoes (I use grape) for an extra rich flavor.

I used just the olive oil, garlic, onions and fresh basil and warmed the spaghetti in it - used parmesan on top - actually quite good.

I was very disappointed.  The recipe calls for way too much feta cheese.  I even added extra pasta and it was overwhelming.  I did add some other veggies to make the dish more satisfying.

This was really good! I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I drained a can of diced and only had red onion on hand. Added a Tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and tsp of dried oregano to the tomato mixture. To complete this meal, I topped this with parmesan crusted Mahi Mahi. My husband literally liked the plate clean! Delicious!!

I love salads like this!..   I added a few more things I wanted to use up and a splash of rice vinegar for acidity: red and green bell pepper and some chopped broccoli.     I didn't have fresh basil so I used dry and it was still delicious...

Quick and easy!  I used one chicken breast and two links spicy italian turkey sausage.  I also added 4 or 5 cayenne chili peppers since I was out of Tobasco.  It was still just a tiny bit too mild for me and my sweetie but we enjoyed it and will try again!

Delicious! I made this for lunch today. It was very easy and quick to make. I sauted the gralic and onions first. The feta and parmesan give a good flavor, but the fresh basil is a "must have". Served hot.

Versatile and easy.  Had a jar of sun-dried tomatoes that needed to be used up, and per BONNIE312's suggestion, used those.  Angel hair (Barilla PLUS, with the Omega-3).  A couple splashes of Red Wine Vinegar and a pour of White wine.  Sauteed the (red) onions, tomatoes, garlic and basil in the olive oil from the tomatoes.   Tomato-Basil feta.  I found this to be a touch dry, but still very flavorful and a pleasant change.

Really tasty! I followed another reviewer's advice and marinated the tomato/onion/basil mixture overnight in the olive oil and some balsamic vinegar, too. Then mixed it in with whole grain pasta and the feta the next morning and served it cold a few hours later. Big hit at an office potluck! I added more garlic (about 3 large cloves and I let it sit in the marinade overnight), a lot more basil than just 6 leaves - i probably tore up about 30 leaves. I used grape tomatoes cut in halves. I sliced the onions in semi-circles rather than dicing them.  It was light and flavorful - will definitely make again.

I loved the flavors in the pasta and the brightness the fresh basil brought to the dish.   I did make a vinaigrette instead of just using olive oil and garlic because we like the tang you get from the vinegar.  To the olive oil and garlic I added 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 tsp of Dijon mustard, 1 tsp of salt and some fresh cracked pepper.  It was good warm, but, I think I will like it even better cold.

I modified this a bit, but I feel like I kept to the chore flavors and I loved the result. I’m eating the leftovers for lunch today! My mods: I sautéed the garlic and onions until they started to get tender, then I kept cooking them for a bit with cut asparagus.  Sadly I didn’t have fresh basil so I used dried.  I tossed the finished pasta and the cooked veggies with the cheese, oil, and seasonings, and then added in the tomatoes and it was spectacular!  I will certainly make this again!

I do not know how anyone can make changes to the recipe then rate the recipe on the changes. I appreciate the suggestions that others make and they are very helpful, but rate the original recipe then add the changes. Very good recipe. Equality good warm or cold. Will make again and again.

This is such an easy recipe.  I used cherry tomatoes cut in half because we are harvesting so many from our garden now!   Sautéed red onion (don't like raw) and then added the olive oil, tomatoes and basil to the pan.   I put it all in a bowl, let it come to room 
temperature and poured it over the pasta. I then added the Parmesan cheese, basil, salt and pepper and diced mozzarella ( had no feta in the house).   This was quick, simple and delicious.   Will definitely make this many times this summer.   Great to bring to a barbecue as a pasta salad!

Very good! I did make some changes but the over all recipe is great. I used red & yelllow tomatoes & more fresh basil. I had left-over spaghetti from the night before so I used that instead of sprials. I also used Greek vinigerette dressing instead of olive oil. I added a cuke too. I will make this again with tomato season just getting starting here in PA. The yellow tomatoes really made it pretty too!

Delicious! I used Trottole pasta and added cukes and halved black olives to the tomato/basil/olive oil mixture. Tossing the warm pasta with the feta and Parmesan cheeses is what takes this over the top. The cheeses get all gooey and melty.

Delicious.  I didn't have feta so I used mozzarella. It came out great but let the pasta cool a little bit so the cheese doesn't melt too much.

I reallly loved this recipe. It was the feta that did it for me. It added just the right flavor. The only thing I did different was add romano. I didn't have parmesan cheese on hand. Thank you for such a great recipe

This is very tasty, but I would reduce the olive oil to 3 table spoons at most and saute the garlic with the onion to bring out their flavor. Also, drain the liquid of the tomatoes before adding them to the rest of the ingredients. The recipe as written comes out very liquidy.

Oh my; this is the best! I went exactly by the recipe except added couple dashes of red pepper flakes and doubled the basil.  I used red onion also. It was fantastic.  We changed it a bit for our preference   
Thank you so much for a make again recipe!

It was ok but not something I would make again.  I chose to use it as a cold side dish and thought it was bland and a bit on the dry side.  The only real flavor was the feta but nothing on the pasta.

After spending a few weeks with relatives in Sicily I experienced a number of excellent recipes.  This one, which my cousin Mario had named Pasta a la Trapanese was an easy keeper. The key, as he explained, is to use almost rotten tomatoes and then just pass them over the cheese grater into a bowl with EVOO, garlic, salt, pepper, basil and GOOD parmigano reggiano. I imagine the feta would be nice and I'll try it and omit salt. ALWAYS a hit!

Nice and simple recipe.  I added a little fresh lemon juice to taste.  It brought out all the flavors perfectly.  Adding cooked shrimp makes this a very nice light meal as well.

Good, but with modifications. Started out making as written but it needed tweaking; otherwise it would have been a 3 star dish at best.

Great basic starting point.  Improvised a bit with whatever was in my frig ... Shrimp, anchovies, Gorgonzola.  Also added apple cider vinegar to the dressing.  Scrumptious!

I thought this needed a lot more flavor, so I added balsamic vinegar and italian seasoning.  That seemed to do the trick.  I'm taking it to a farewell luncheon tomorrow so I'll see how well it's received, but it seems to be missing that kick.  Maybe some capers or olives would kick it up a notch, but the main issue I think I have with it is the flavor (or lack thereof) in the dressing itself.  Needs a bit of doctoring, in my opinion, to make a pasta salad I'd make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fine recipe, but I don't think it's something I'll make again.  I would like some more ingredients, maybe something to make the dish more nutritious.  If it had more nutrients and less fat it would probably be worth keeping in my recipe box.  I had leftovers and they weren't very good the next day (but I don't grade a recipe based on how well the leftovers keep).  If you think this needs more flavor, you can try adding a little balsamic vinegar.

This was pretty good. I wish I could give it 3.5. I will not put the whole leaf of basil in there next time. I only used 12 oz of feta cheese and that was plenty for us.

We loved this recipe!  I sauted some shrimp with onion powder and omitted the onion in the recipe (since my hubby doesn't like onion).  I also used grape tomatoes halved and seasoned feta.  Delicious!  I will definitely make this again!  We had the left overs the next night cold and it was just as yummy!

Everybody in my house loved this dish, including my picky 7-year-old grandson.

I did make some adjustments, based on other reviewers' suggestions.  I used a box of grape tomatoes, and sauteed them, along with the garlic, in the olive oil until the tomatoes began to burst.  I used fresh herbs from my garden, and substituted chives for the onion, along with basil and parsley. I also added some kalamata olives.

Otherwise I made the recipe as written, and it tasted so fresh and good!  Thank you Angela Dawn!

This was a flavorful dish that I quite enjoyed. The only change I made was the pasta, I used small shells, which still hold sauce nicely, but I find the smaller pasta easier to eat since I tend to read while I eat and pasta isn’t jumping off my fork as easily when I use the little shells and attempt to eat 1 handed! I will definitely make this again, and I can see where I may add or change things depending on what I have on hand, but this truly is delicious as is. I guess there are less and less of us who actually make the dish as directed and rate the flavor from the original recipe. Technically I did change something, but pasta shape doesn’t change the flavor. Some of y’all changed pretty much every ingredient. Thank you for a great recipe! I foresee I will make this often, sometimes as written, and sometimes as a base for my own concoctions! This is a garden friendly recipe that would go great with other veggies I have that need using, but will also be just as great when I’m simply trying to exhaust the unending supply of tomatoes that seem to happen during tomato season!

This was a great recipe that has that fresh basil taste!  I used penne noodles instead, and omitted the onion.  I'd suggest using less olive oil when making, and adding more just before serving.

This was great! I made it for my family. It's really easy to adapt for people who don't like the vegetables because you can just leave them out! We took a small portion of the noodles and cheese out of the big bowl so my brother could have it without the tomato mix. Great recipe! I totally recommend it!

I made this salad last night.  It was easy but a bit bland.  But when I added kalamata olives and artichoke hearts it was much improved.  The next time i make it I will add more tomato and maybe some capers too.  With those additions it was a super salad.  If you like it spicy a few red pepper flakes would be nice, but I just wanted more flavor, not the spice.  4 stars with my changes.

Used 5 oz chickpea pasta, lightly fried onion and garlic in basil olive oil, stirred in one pint of cherry tomatoes cut in half, and some sliced sundried tomatoes and let that stew for a few minutes.  Added a LOT of basil and let it just wilt before adding it all to the pasta. Used feta but not parmesan cheese.  DELICIOUS!!

Been using this recipe for a few years. Every time I make it, it gets raves. Couple of changes: I use dried basil, fresh ground pepper, Himalayan pink salt, fresh Parmesan.

It was great. I sautéed the vegetable first. My boyfriend loved it and ate the rest straight from the pot. Lol

This was tasty and easy to make. Instead of onion I minced two small shallots and added some capers. I used tortellini  as that is what I had on hand. We ate it the first night warm and the second cold and it was just as good both nights. I love parsley and had some fresh on hand so I minced a handful and threw that in with the fresh basil. Like some others mentioned, I also add a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar. Will definitely make this often.

This was delicious!  I used fresh mozzarella, which I  love with fresh basil, and that, along with following other's suggestions of including halved cherry tomatoes, gave it a Caprese like taste.  I also had some zucchinis I needed to use, so I sauteed the onions and then added the zucchinis till they were soft.  Very tasty and healthy.  I'll try it with feta next time.

Yummy!! I virtually doubled this recipe and did little measuring in the way of ingredients, but I did use fresh cherry tomatoes and cut them in half length-wise and used my fresh basil! So light, fresh and will be my Fourth of July Picnic Pasta salad today!

Outstanding! It could actually be used as the main course, if it's warm. Loved it warm, right after making it, and I'm looking forward to eating it cold tomorrow! I think guests will enjoy this tomorrow, on the fourth. Oh, and the fresh basil is a MUST! It makes the dish. I substituted Barilla whole grain penne regatta and it was absolutely fine. This is now one of my favorite pasta salads. Yum yum!! Carolyn Y

Made exactly as written. I had an abundance of fresh basil that I wanted to use up and found this recipe. Paired it with thin sliced marinated flank steak & garlic bread both cooked on the grill for an easy summertime meal.

Even my husband, who is not normally a fan of pasta salad, loved it. It's clean, fresh taste and on-hand ingredients make it a definite keeper. Will try again when we have our own garden ripe tomatoes.

Really good and so easy.  I used penne pasta only because that's what I had in the pantry but made no other changes.  I  finely chopped the onion as directed and thought it added a nice flavor without being overwhelming at all.  I will make this again and might add some sliced olives but doesn't need any changes.  Was really delish, thanks!

Excellent! I used all the listed ingredients and amounts, but prepared it a little different. As others suggested, I sauteed the onion and garlic. After they had cooled, I combined them with the olive oil, tomatoes, and basil, and let that sit overnight in the fridge (although I don't think this was necessary). I let the tomato mixture warm up to room temp while the pasta was cooking and then added it, along with the cheese, to the hot pasta when it was done. Will definitely make again!

This looked like a great Summer pasta, but I still felt like I needed a good protein to go with it.  I found the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs on this site, and found a great Summer combo.  This pasta is great warm or cold.  Was perfect with the kabobs, and made great lunch leftovers cold the next day.  Full of flavor.  Just a solid Summer dish that will be in regular rotation.  Made as written, and would change anything.

My opinion is this was really good when first made and still a little warm.  Once cold, it lost a lot of flavor.

I served this with warm pasta, but reduced the feta  & shouldn't have. We added more feta to make the amount asked for. Maybe if it was cold pasta I could've gotten by with less as usually feta cheese is overpowering to me. Will make again & probably add more fresh basil.

I thought this pasta was delicious. It was very light. Great for a summer evening. As other reviewers mentioned, it tastes just as good cold as it does warm.

Absolutely delish!  Yes, you can add to or take away as some of the other reviews have stated, but I have a very sensitive pallet and had no issues getting this one down!  My hubby has even asked me to make it again which rarely happens (without changing a thing might I add).

I've made this several times now and each time it's always a hit.  So much better than your typical pasta salad that you see at every family gathering.  The first time I made this, I followed the exact recipe and it was good although a tad bland, but still good as written.  Now I've perfected it to my family's tastes by adding some fresh baby spinach, a little extra garlic, a tablespoon of sun dried tomatoes that I had on hand and a few drizzles of White Balsamic Vinegar.  I love that it can be served warm or cold.  My only regret - I keep forgetting to take photos to post.

This was one of the best, simplest recipes I have come across in a long time! Perfect summer pasta salad- I didn't change the recipe at all except to use 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and about twice the amount of fresh, ripped basil (makes a huge difference). Very Italian style recipe!
* I cut the fresh tomatos added the garlic, onion, Olive oil, basil and fresh cracked pepper and let it sit on the counter covered for about 2 hours before making the pasta which I feel is essential to getting the full flavors to mingle!!

This recipe comes together in a flash.  I did make a couple of changes.  I always use whole wheat pasta because the favor, texture and nutritional value. I cooked the onions and garlic (3-4 cloves) in the olive oil first.  After it was done I shut off the heat and added the tomatoes to warm them (not cook them).  Did about three times the amount of basil called for and roughly chopped it and throw it on top of the tomatoes.  I had forgotten to add the cheese to the pasta before it had cooled so put I it on low heat in a pan and added some chicken stock to help melt the cheese.  It was fantastic! I will absolutely make this again and again!

The whole family liked this recipe. I changed it by using 4 tbsp. oil, which I will change to 3 tbsp. next time. I also used 12 oz. of bowtie pasta just because I didn't want the leftover 2 oz. I added shredded chicken and peas to make it a complete meal. I thought the feta would over power so I didn't use as much as what's called for, but it would have been just fine. I also added shredded Romano and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick. Next time I'll use a pint of grape tomatoes like another reviewer posted and continue to use sundried also. Very tasty dish! I'll use this again and again for sure. Thanks for sharing!

Tried this last minute and liked it very much.  I added other veges, sautéed peppers and squash, which added flavor and more substance.  It was a meal in itself with French bread.  Will use this for summer picnics and outdoor dinners.

My whole family begged me to make this again.  I made as written. May add cooked diced chicken next time.

Next time I'll make this without the onions or I will cut the number of onions in half and saute the onion and garlic first so that they are soft.  My family and I didn't care for this as prepared above at all.  Hopefully the flavors will be enhanced once the dish has had a chance to sit in the fridge.

This was really good.  I didn't have enough basil for the recipe, but I put in what I had and it was really good. I would definitly make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised at how great this was and I even used gluten-free penne pasta!  I did add a bit more garlic, basil and some red pepper flakes for heat but it would still be great without the additions. I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  It's super easy and quick to make.  Good with shrimp.  The only change I'll make for next time is I'll saute the onion and garlic because my husband doesn't care for them raw.

Whole family enjoyed this one!  Made it with my garden tomatoes.  Took other readers' advice and sauteed the onion and garlic first.  Next time I'll double the recipe so we have plenty of leftovers for the next day!

I added sauteed mushrooms and steamed asparagus tips. I would suggest cutting back onion and oil amounts.  The other suggestions of adding tomato is a great idea.

Used my fresh garden tomatoes and basil, I did not have any feta cheese, so I increased the Parmesan. Excellent, much better than going out for Italian.

Great simple recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe just added a lot more basil than the recipe called for. I just love a lot more intense basil flavor. Have made it a few times . This one is definitely a keeper.

Very Very Good!!  I did saute the onion and garlic for a bit in 2 T of the Olive oil~ used a lot of fresh basil fr/ my garden (rolled and sliced) and added a bit of chopped gr onion, but other than that I followed the recipe.  So good, we had it warm for dinner then cold the next day.  Both were so tasty!  This recipe is so great b/c you can add so much to it or leave as is.  Next time I will add some chopped blk olives and pepperoni.  I can also see adding some marinated artchoke hearts as well.  Thanks for sharing!

My family and friends loved this. I think I can give it 5 stars even though I altered it slightly. ( I know I should rate the recipe as is)  I used more basil than called for, and also added about a cup of cubed mozzarella. I had to make this twice in 2 days because my 11 year old daughter was so crazy about it.

Didn't have fresh basil, so used arugula and asparagus (which I had on hand). Bacon bits used to add smokey flavor.  Served this dish warm and topped with freshly grated Gran Padano parmesan cheese.

This was fantastic! Next time I will make a few changes, though. I will use green pepper in stead of tomato, saute the garlic with the basil beforehand spices and leave the onion out. I also added Calamata olives and crushed red pepper, next time I think I'll add about a teaspoon. Great recipe!

The garlic and onion were a little strong.  I would have sauted them for JUST a couple of minutes before adding them to the mixture.  We used goat cheese in place of feta and it was a nice change.  Overall we really liked it but the garlic/onion were a little overwelming.  I would double the basil but I LOVE basil!
