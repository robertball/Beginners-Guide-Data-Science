Yum! Not only is this cheap to make, it's equally easy to throw together and surprisingly filling too. Although fine as is, I do have one suggestion for improvement. Instead of slicing your cabbage, I suggest you chop it. Both my hubs and I agree that chopped or finely shredded cabbage (i.e. the pre-packaged stuff) would be a better choice for this dish. It would cook quicker (as is, my cabbage was a *tad* crunchy - and I even cooked it longer than directed) and incorporate MUCH better with the potatoes. I guess this is a matter of preference, but it is a definite must for my hubs and I. And for the one reviewer who thought this was bland... Bah! The key is s&p and LOTS of it. :) It's a shame this only has three reviews. Hopefully others will follow suit and soon discover this wonderful gem and add their positive comments for others to see! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ashley! :-)

I have made this tonight for dinner for family and friends. I cooked the spuds on the cook top as the 1st part of this recipe. All the other cooking I did in the microwave. Faster, easier and less time involved. This tasted great. Will make this often. Thank you Ashley for what will become a favourate. Spuds don't need to be boring, just really tasty like this recipe.

I just made this for dinner tonight and was very happy with it. I probably didn't follow the recipe directions to a T (I read it then just go by memory) and I left out the cayenne pepper because my kids won't touch anything spicy in any way. Otherwise I used all the same ingredients and it was very tasty! I salted my water when boiling the potatoes and salted my cabbage a bit when adding it to the pan and it definitely was not bland at all. My kids are already begging for more!

Made this using leftover corned beef, fried cabbage and mashed potatoes. Added a pinch of red pepper and topped with shredded sharp cheddar. We enjoyed the original recipe as well as the improvised version. A handy go-to!

We think this is the bomb!  A great mix of flavors and a meal in one dish - no need for anything else.  Did not vary anything except for the use Greek Yogurt in place of mayo and a little more than half a pack of pre-shredded cabbage (will use the whole package next time).  Yummmmm

This a family favorite.  I do shred some cheddar to sprinkle on top, per another review's suggestion. Love this with our home grown caraflex cabbage, but with plain old grocery store stuff it is still yummy comfort food.

I thought this was very tasty.  I didn't have ham, so just used bacon, but it was very good without it.  The cayenne pepper is a plus!

We really enjoyed this as part of our New Years dinner.  The only changes I made were to omit the mayonnaise (we just don't care that much for mayo), added a little more than 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, added about 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt to the cabbage mixture, and omitted the ham.  Everyone thought it was great and my boyfriend asked me to make it again--very soon.  Thank you for another great recipe. Edit: I made this again 11/2019 and made a couple of changes. I boiled the potatoes in vegetable stock and then, in place of 1/2 cup of water I added 1/2 cup of the potato/vegetable stock. I used seasoned salt, pepper, and Mrs. Dash to season it. Very, very good. Hubby (boyfriend in earlier review) loved it and has asked me to make it again, only two days after I made it before. Success!

Everyone seemed to like this recipe, hubby felt it needed more flavor, soo I looked at him rather strangely until I tried it. I think that there needs to be more seasoning in the potatoes with mashing. Adding later, tends to be an after thought and the spices don't mend well, however it was nice in overall flavor. Got one picky kid to eat it and that was a total plus.

Tried this tonight and made it to specs except drained bacon onion, reserving drippings and stir fried the cabbage instead.It was a hit!
Will be making again though I might add more cabbage.

Didn't add the cheese or the mayonnaise.  My grandsons - the potato eaters extraordinaire raved about the recipe. My neighbor also said it was fabulous.
You can be sure that I'll be adding this to my  regular repertoire of potato recipes!

Interesting taste, first time making this. Not bad tasting but I am not sure if anybody else in my family will like it. I had to use up the potatoes and cabbage that I used for my corned beef and cabbage that I am baking, according to another recipe on this site. The cabbage was not very thinly slice so it took over 30 minutes to wilt when it was with the onion mixture.

I left out the mayonnaise and substituted some sour cream and cream cheese to the mashed potatoes. I sautéed leeks, scallions and chives and onions along with the cabbage to give more green for a St. Patrick's day luncheon. Sprinkled top with cheddar and crumbled bacon and parsley for color. I also added some cayenne, not much since it was still mild. Very good.

Made this for a Book Club potluck (we read Irish Colum McGann books) and it disappeared. I used mix of russet, gold, and red potatoes that I had on hand. Used heavy cream instead of milk. I didn't know how big the onion or cabbage were in the recipe, but I used 1 cup finely diced sweet onion and  3c  finely sliced green cabbage. I used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular salt, and opted for ground black pepper instead of cayenne since not everyone can take the heat. Added chopped ham from leftover holiday ham which made this a hearty, filling main dish. I'd  never made Colcannon before, but this was a huge hit- my hubby who is averse to cooked cabbage kept going back for more! I dotted small chunks of butter on top to make mini-wells of melted butter and sprinkled top with minced green part of green onions to garnish for company.

Very tasty, although I did have to modify the recipe since the leftover ham I was going to use disappeared (I have teenage boys). I substituted pepperoni which I sliced and added to the cabbage. I also substituted red pepper flakes since I was out of cayenne pepper. There were no leftovers!!

I was really in the mood for comfort food tonight and this totally fit the bill. I've tried Colcannon before but not with as much success as I had with this recipe. I think the technique of sauteing the cabbage and onions with bacon made a difference. I don't eat pork so I substituted turkey bacon and turkey meat for the bacon and ham with good results. I also left out the cayenne and used mustard in the mashed potatoes for a little zing. And as others suggested I topped with a bit of grated cheese. Hubbie was happy.

This was really delicious! I had to leave out the cayenne pepper simply because I didn't have any, but still really good. Will definitely make again!

This is a great one pot (pretty much) meal. I fed 6 people and had leftovers. Very economical!
