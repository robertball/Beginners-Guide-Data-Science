I made this in my usual mug, which holds 16 oz. Only changes I made were a dash of salt and a tsp. of vanilla extract. It's 26Â° and snowing as I write this, and this is the perfect drink with which to start my day.

I used Splenda instead of Sweet N Low only because that's the sweetener I had on hand. I made no other changes. Not bad--I'd make it again.

For my tastes, the coffee needs to be MUCH stronger.  I think this is just one of those recipes where you have to adjust the strength of the coffee, and the amount of the cocoa and sweetener to suit your own personal preference.  It's a pretty nice drink that looks like the fancy coffee shop beverages but has low calories and fat, just what I was looking for.

I used Splenda and Soy milk. It's just ok, don't think I will make it again.

I had to add a lot of extra sugar than it says, not using Sweet n Low, either. I think that I would have also added some cream with it. Being someone who isn't a fan of plain coffee, I found it hard to finish.

An easy mocha you can make at home! I made mine this morning and found a ghost floating in the foam!
