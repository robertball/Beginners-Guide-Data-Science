These were wonderful. I tried them both with and without the chocolate chips. We really preferred them without. I will be making these again. Thanks Chef John. Fantastic!

Thanks to Chef John. Another ten star dessert. I used walnut, it turned out great.

These "greenies" were very good - all were eaten at the concert I took them to last night. I liked the crunchy texture and they weren't overly sweet. I did not include the chocolate chips. It took 3 oranges, 1 tablespoon of zest is produced per each (only 2 tsp. were needed from the last one). I've zested so many oranges now that I don't measure any more. One thing I'd like to try is making the 1/2 cup of flour from pistachios so that my friend that  has gluten intolerance can eat them. It was fun telling people that I had made "greenies", some expected them to be laced with pot.

I followed this recipe exactly, and thought they were awful. Flavors did not blend well,  the texture was weird, and they just tasted very odd. I have used many recipes from this site, and most have turned out from decent to really good. I have never posted a review before, but the disappointment of this one was a shock!

These were delicious. Even better the second day as they moisten up. 
I had only 1 1/2 cups of pistachios on hand so I added 1/2 cup slivered almonds and it turned out great.
Added the chocolate chips and can't imagine leaving them out.
