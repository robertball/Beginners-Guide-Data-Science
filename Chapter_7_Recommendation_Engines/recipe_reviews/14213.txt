This was a fun change of pace for us.  We took it to a potluck and were asked for the recipe.  We couldn't find wagon wheels, so we used medium shells, and we used grilled elk sirloin instead of beef.  Very nice flavor and a beautiful presentation.

I was advised by my family NOT to do this meal again, however I think part of that was my fault.  I didn't have the Dijon so I skipped it.  Think this would have made a big difference.

This was just okay.  I would delete the onions - I don't really like uncooked onions and double or triple the sauce.

My family found this one to be quite bland.  Can't quite put my finger on what it needed.  Didn't like the sauce with pasta.

This was quite good, and really cute with the wagon wheel pasta. A few friends had this with me for lunch and they liked it as well. Thanks.

This was really good and simple to make.
I altered it just a bit, like cooking the onions, adding a bit olive oil and not having the meat. This is something I will make again. ^_^
