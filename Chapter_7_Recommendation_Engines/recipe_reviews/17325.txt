OH MY WORD!!!!! This is sooooo good!!! The amazing part is we only had time to marinate half an hour!!! I poked the steak with a fork all over, laid it in a shallow dish & poured enough marinade to cover the top & overflow a little & rubbed it in. In 15 minutes I flipped it over & did the same to the other side. I only used half the marinade so I could let my husband use the rest for basting the last few minutes on the grill. This was sooo good I told my husband he needn't take me out to steakhouses (my absolute favorite!!) anymore - he can just grill our own at home!! We used T-bone steaks. I used about 1/8 c. balsamic and the rest white wine vinegar because I ran out of the balsamic. Both our company & us ate til' we couldn't eat anymore only because it was so good!! I served with salad, Grilled Corn on the Cob (also on this site), Greek Chicken Pasta (without the chicken - also on this site), & garlic bread. MmmMmm Good!!

My husband doesn't like any marinade on his steak. But when he brought home some bottom sirloin I decided to try this recipe. Well he loved it and now we are eating bottom sirloin on a regular basis. I used freshly sliced onions in place of onion powder and I ommited the liquid smoke. I found that if I put everything in a ziploc bag there is enough marinade for 4 or 5 steaks. I also score my steaks in a diagonal grid pattern on each side before I marinade them. This makes them really tender.

A 5-star marinade;  perfect blend of ingredients in just the right amount, and perfect (in particular) for steak.  Outstanding!  I was a little concerned that the relatively large amount of basalmic vinegar would make the steaks too tangy or “sour” tasting, but instead, I was very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this simple, yet extremely tasty marinade.  Following the recipe exactly as written, the marinade did not overpower the inherent flavor of the steak, but rather complimented it very, very nicely, in perhaps a bit more subtle way than you might think.   Be sure to use a good, *non*-“light” variety of basalmic, soy sauce, and olive oil (note: not extra-virgin style), as this is essentially the base of the marinade.  Liquid smoke is perfect in the amount it is originally called for.  Any more than that, and it has a chance of taking over the flavor that was intended by this recipe.  Highly Recommended as its original author intended!

This is a good marinade if you like sweet (ie:oriental) type marinades.  We like our steaks more on the savory level then the sweet level.  We liked this, but probably not enough to make it again. I even cut the honey in half but it was still to sweet for us.

I didn't marinate overnight, but just rubbed the mixture into the meat. Then fried it up on the stove and nervously placed a plate in front of my husband. He's a steak fanatic, and doesn't deal with anything other than naked beef very well. He was in awe. The meat was tender and wonderful tasting. Great recipe!!!

I marinated two NY strip steaks in this and this is one of the best marinades I've tried so far.  I let them marinate for 10 hours instead of 1-2 days and I think that was plenty of time because the flavor really came through.

Used a NY strip and marinated for about 24 hours.  The one thing I did and it turned out pretty well was to reduce the amount of vinegar.  It was still pretty strong.  Good recipe, thanks for the post.

So good.  I marinated a 2 lb. top sirloin steak overnight.  Nice crust and very flavorful.  BBQed for about 25 min. for med-well.

Am unusually particular about meat marinades as they tend to overpower the flavor of the steak and what then would be the point of eating a great steak?  This was surprisingly a nice change of pace for a steak marinade and would definitely would make again, but no need to add salt as the soy sauce has enough in it to compensate for leaving it out and you don't miss it in the flavor.   Thanks Angie for giving me another option!

marinated 1 hour in my vacuvin marinating dish. perfect amount of time, over night would have been way to strong and overpowered the taste of the meat. with 1 hour it complimented it very nice. DH LOVED it.

This is perfect as is and most kitchens would have all ingredients. The only thing I did was eliminated the salt completely as I felt the soy sauce would provide enough sodium. This is definitely a keeper!

Note to self - when you are not too fond of balsamic vinegar, don't make a recipe that has it as a prominent ingredient!  I can see why so many people enjoy the flavor, but we were kind of so-so on this one.  Just one of those personal taste issues.  There isn't anything wrong with this recipe and if I make it again, I will use red wine vinegar and probably even out the vinegar/olive oil ratio. I thought the steaks would have a strong garlic flavor, but all I really noticed was the balsamic.

This is a very good "as is" recipe. Though we really liked it and would recommend it, it still isn't our all time favorite. The best yet is also on this site called "BBQ NY Strip". Check that one out also!

Followed exactly... The Acid from balsamic vinegar made this unpalatable - bummer ... I have nothing but outstanding experiences with the masses on all recipes.  But you can't please everyone. It looked like a lot of vinegar- I would suggest halving it!

Since finding this recipe, we don't use anything else for marinating steaks.  And definitely use rib-eyes; they are the best.  My only complaint is that now my husband doesn't want to go out for steaks!  He says, "Why go out when they are so good at home?!" Thanks for sharing your recipe!  We

Ok so this was BY FAR the BEST london broil I ever made!!! My hubby couldnt get enough of it. Whats funnier is that I messed up the recipe a bit & it came out amazing. Instead of putting 1/4 cup of soy I used 1/4 cup of Wistershire sauce & only a touch of soy.  I didnt have the liquid smoke either but under teh broiler it came out amazing! I HIGHLY reccomend it to garlic lovers!!!! Thank you sooo much Angie! This ones a keeper for sure!

As I read the reviews I noticed this is one marinade you love or hate! We loved it! It does have a strong balsamic flavor, but we like that flavor.  I marinaded it for about 3 hrs in a vac marinator and that was enough for me.  Next time I would maybe leave out the salt or half it . . . and I also bubbled the liquid smoke (I love that stuff) and used 1 tps of black pepper. 6 mins cooking on each side worked for us.  Thanks Angie for a good marinade.

This recipe was disappointing. I followed the directions exactly. The marinade smelled wonderful, but ruined the steaks. I would rather throw the steaks on the grill with no marinade and sprinkle some steak seasoning on top... it would taste much better than this recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. I love vinegar but i don't want my food to swim in it. This marinades proportions are all wrong, all we could taste was vinegar on the beautiful steaks I forked out for. My partner said all he could taste was the vinegar and no steak taste at all. Complete waste of time, effort and money. I will  never be making these again. such a shame.

Very flavorful but with an overpowering vinegar taste.  As a personal preference, the the amount of black pepper was reduced by half.  The steaks were marinated for 2 days before grilling as suggested by the submitter.  I'd cut the amount of vinegar by at least half before attempting this recipe again and marinate it for no more than 6-8 hours.

Am not a balsamic vinegar fan so used red wine vinegar instead. Very happy with this marinade for both steak and chicken. Make a note to yourself regarding discarding leftover marinade: Instead of being wasteful simply cook it in a small saucepan at a slow rolling boil for five minutes and use it to flavor pasta or rice ;-)

My all-time favorite marinade! I make it exactly as written except that I omit the cayenne pepper because that's not something I generally have on hand. We have used this with several kinds of steak, as well as with chicken breasts, and it comes out all tasting incredible every time. The marinade keeps well, so sometimes we even reuse it - marinade chicken breasts in it overnight, pop the chicken on the grill for dinner, then put steaks in the marinade for another overnight soak and grill them the following night. Works great! :)

Smelled great but the flavor was not very strong.  I admit that I omitted the liquid smoke because I hate the taste.  Disappointed.

Me and my guests drooled over this marinade, the flavor was fantastic.  I will definately be making this again and again.  I followed the recipe to a T, but only marinated for 4 hours.  Excellent marinade!

Great flavor! My only mistake was marinating 2 (1lb each) ribeyes for 2 days. Was a bit too flavored. Next time, we'll marinate for about 4 hours or so.

OMG This has to be the best way to ruin a good cut of meat that I've ever tried. There is NO meat flavor left. All we could taste was the seasonings. I gave it a one star because there is no Zero. Do yourself a favor and skip this one and grill your rib eye with just a little salt and pepper.

I've been a member on this site for a few years and usually enjoy the recipes I've found here. I followed the recipe exactly as written and marinated them for 1-1/2 days.. My NY Strips tasted like vinegar and I still have the aftertaste in my mouth. And the steaks were not even any more tender than without the marinade.  saturday night.

Wow, great recipe!! I didn't have as much time to marinate the steaks, I only had about five hours and they turned out scrumptious!! I didn't have onion powder so I used some fresh chopped onions instead, probably about 1/4 cup (because I love onions).  As well, I didn't have cayenne pepper so I didn't use that.  Otherwise I followed the recipe precisely and I thought it was one of the most tender and flavorfull steaks I have had in a very long time (and I used to be a grill cook at a restaurant and cooked 30-50 steaks daily).  Very much highly recommended by me and I will be using this recipe for years to come!

I usually don't like marinades on steak but this was FANTASTIC! I could not believe how tender and juicy the steak was. Normally we buy tenderloin but my husband got the cheapie steaks, and I couldn't believe how great they were. Won't need to fork over the $$$ for expensive steak again! SO GOOD!!!

There were so many good reviews I decided to ignore the negative reviews, wish I hadn't.  Didn't care for the overpowering seasonings that ruined the taste of the steak.  I am deleting this one.

I  did not like this marinade. I followed it exactly and i dont know if i did something wrong but all i could taste was balsamic viniger. Too sour and it didnt complement the meat. I even marrinated it for 2 days. I won't be making it again.

I really enjoyed this. I came home from the city and had to quickly make dinner so I bought some rump steaks from the supermarket. My steaks only had one hour to marinade and OMG they were tender! I pounded out the steaks with a mallet and put them in the fridge with the marinade, making sure they were well coated. I had to double the recipe because of how many people I had to feed and I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic because that's all I had. I seared the first side of the steak on #7 on frypan and then after 2 mins let it cook on #5 and then turned the steak over to cook on #5. My steaks were as tender as water. They just dissolved in my mouth. Hubby and I agreed on four stars because it was just like a normal teriyaki steak flavour and not out of this world. I also didn't have the liquid smoke or powdered onion.

Very tasty.  Would agree with some of the views about maybe reducing the balsamic vinager though. The Steak was so tender, it melted in your mouth.  Made tortilla wraps with the left overs the next day... Simply scrummy!!!

This is a wonderful marinate.  We used it for a sirloin roast (overnight & turned it over in the morning) and cooked it on a rotisserie on the BarBQ using only the infra-red element & no other heat & it turned out terrific!  It adds a wonderful flavour, & of course, it couldn't be any more tender.  Note:  I didn't have any 'smoke' in so I left it out & it didn't seem to have any great impact as a result.  I would say the 'smoke' is optional.  Joan Smulders

This was really good.  I marinated cubes of chuck roast for kabobs.  It was well liked by all.  I did cut back the garlic, as the large amount made me nervous.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The second time I made as is and really enjoyed this recipe. But the first time I didn't have any liquid smoke...not even sure what that is but it was great without. I also didn't have any soy sauce. I added about 1/4 c of A1 steak sauce and increased the amount of worcestershire to about 1/2 cup. A little on the sweet side but it was great!!

Very good! I used everything as written, except for the balsamic. The one I have is very expensive, comes in 8oz bottles, and I couldn't see using half a bottle for a marinade, lol!  I used a good splash (probably 1 T) of some sherry vinegar instead.  I used the marinade (24hrs)on some cheap-o ribeyes from Sam's. I always marinate things in zip-lock bags rather than a glass dish (just me!). They turned out wonderful!  I cook mine in an iron skillet (Alton Brown method), and the sweetness in this marinade helped to make a gorgeous, caramelized sear on the steaks. DH, who is normally vehemently opposed to marinating/flavoring a steak with anything other than salt and pepper loved this marinade. I think I might even let them marinate longer next time.  Thanks!

the only reason i gave this one star is because the name is misleading. the marinade is the opposite of savory, its very sweet. this is an excellent marinade for those who love teriyaki. i would make this again when i'm in the mood for teriyaki but maybe changing the name to sweet garlic marinade so we know what we are getting.

This is not a bad recipe at all, but I think it is just too strong of a marinade for a good piece of steak. It just alters the flavor of the meat way too much instead of complimenting it. My opinion is simply that a good steak just doesn't need it.

i made it for my husband the other night….and he ate it all up… loved the marinade, it smelled amazing the whole night it was marinating in the fridge… i don't know what it tasted like in the end cause i don't eat meat.. but he definitely enjoyed it… one thing he said was that it needed some sauce…. so for the garlic lovers out there, i bought A1 garlic steak sauce for this..and it complimented it very well…

Ok so I made this an Asian marinade by adding the juice of one orange and eliminating the worchest sauce and the liquid smoke...no honey so added just a bit of brown sugar, pierced the steaks and marinated for only 20 minutes, then microwaved the remaining marinade to thicken and added the pan juices to serve over white rice as a sauce with an Asian salad.  Amazing. My new favorite recipe.

This steak is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.  We have eaten it for the past 3 Sundays, per request of my husband.  Its worth the try , I just decreased the honey to 1 tbsp bc we prefer tangy over the sweet.   :)

Very good, but the cooking time depends on thickness of steak, and how you grill it.   A good Weber grill(gas) calls for nearly all grilling do be done with the cover closed.  I grill at very high temperature with cover down.  3 1/2 minutes on one side, turn and 4 on the other side, depending on thickness.  Med rare to rare.  turn heat off if you want more done,  don't forget the meat continues to cook as it rests. Very good marinade.

I can't imagine a ribeye that would need vinegar to marinate, let alone marinate for 1-2 days. So, I subbed beer for the vinegar, as I like the texture of my good beef to remain...well, beef-like. I only let it sit for 9 hours; again, because good steak doesn't need anything but a kiss of flavor (no tenderization to break down the grain). My fiancee and I really enjoyed this, and I can definatly see where this is a marinade that truly needs 1-2 days itself to develop. I am not convinced you would get a much different result if you just used bottled zesty italian salad dressing with some soy and honey, but... So, next time, I am trying it with a cheaper steak (such as a "flat iron" one) or a thick cut pork chop. I like where this recipe is going, but true steak lovers appreciate STEAK for the sake of it being steak...not flavored rubber.

I really did not like the flavor it gave the steaks :(......it over powered them and you could no longer taste the flavor of the steak itself.  I will not make this again.

This was among the best marinades that I have ever had.  I took the advice of other reviewers, and marinaded NY Strip for about five hours.  It came out absolutely tremendous.  Definitely will make again.

Do not change a thing, and marinade it for as long as you can. The second time I made them was for our backyard bbq party. I marinade them for 2 days and I swear no one said 1 word as they ate them and when they were done they raved and I wrote out the recipe 9 times. This is exceptional

This is one if our favorites! Although the long marinating is a bit strong for us, we shorten the time to about an hour or so for thicker cut and 30 mins for thin cut steaks.

I marinated sirloin kebabs in this winning marinade recipe, for my brother and his family. He called after they finished dinner to say that these were the best he has ever had. The meat was flavorful and tender, a good endorcement for sirloin steak. He also said that it reminded him of the best beef kebabs he had in Parker, AZ over 20 years ago! Wow! Thank you, Angie!

Awesome recipe. I had some slight changes in mine though, like I didn't marinate overnight as well as changing from balsamic vinegar to apple cider vinegar. Tastes great!

This is very good.  I've been using this marinade for a few years, and it is my go-to recipe when we grill steaks.  I always use a NY strip.  The SO, who is a meat purist and typically doesn't want his steak marinated, loves this. Leftovers are fantastic in a romaine salad with blue cheese crumbles and a balsamic vinaigrette.

The balsamic vinegar totally overwhelms the natural flavor of the meat.  I might try it with lemon juice rather than the vinegar.

Loved this!!!  Used only 1/4c of the balsamic, increased the worcestershire to a tablespoon and upped the liquid smoke to a full teaspoon. Marinated a london broil for 48 hours....grilled and just delicious! I brought the left over marinade to a boil for a few minutes and served that as a nice extra sauce on the side. Thanks!

More flavorful than I could've imagined! Just watch it with the grill heat, as the sugars in the honey will easily turn into black crust if you're not careful.

This just had too much balsamic vinegar taste and barely any garlic flavor. We marinated for 24 hours and grilled. My husband used wood chips for the smoke flavor rather than the liquid smoke. We will not make again as I feel it was a waste of our steak. I don't mind trying different marinade recipes for steaks but don't think I am cut out for it. Just give me steak with garlic and pepper seasoning.

Used this on good Iowa corn fed beef rib-eyes and was very disappointed.  Could not taste the beef flavor, just Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. Probably OK on a cheap grass fed cut of beef.

Excellent marinade. I went camping and put this marinade in a zip lock bag with 3 sirloin steaks and boy we sure were pleased. It tasted wonderful. I used an aged balsamic vinegar (very thick). I cut down slightly on the honey and vinegar as I didn't want it too sweet.Thanks for the recipe.

After reading the reviews I had to try this marinade. My husband even said it was real good. I thought it was really good, great flavor. I only marinated the sirloin for 30 minutes. Next time I'll marinate for longer. Thanks for the recipe.

I marinated the steaks for around 8 hours before grilling. These steaks did not need any type of steak sauce--were delicious as is.  After dinner tonight, my husband asked me take steaks out of the freezer so I could marinate them and we could have them again for dinner tomorrow night.  YUM!

This was a pretty good recipe but could use some improvement. The was too much balsamic vinegar flavour so I cut the amount in half the next time I made it and it was really tasty.  I also added some dried herbs like oregeno and thyme.  Overall this was a fantastic recipe.

I used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar instead of 1/2 cup; left out the liquid smoke and honey and let this marinate for about 2 hours (I used cubed steak as this was all I had at the time). We thought it turned out really well. I certainly wouldn't use any more vinegar or I think it might overpower the dish. Will make this again.

this was good, but not great. I followed the recipe to a tee and marinated in the refrigerator for 2 days. Granted we should have flipped after one day, but when we pan grilled it, it crusted and ended up tasting burned even though we didn't over cook it at all (the center was medium). It was also a bit salty -- but with kosher meat that may be to be expected.

This had lots of flavor! I used a cheap cut of meat, marinated over night, broiled in the oven, and then sliced it up for fajitas. Very flavorful!

Seriously awesome marinade! It's nice because the final flavor doesn't lean to far towards Italian, Asian, or spicy. I marinated our steaks overnight, pan fried them, then served them sliced over a salad. They were great!

THIS WAS DIVINE! It was my first time making steaks, so I was nervous about the "vinegary" taste, but it tasted pretty good. Even with my slight alterations, there was plenty left to marinate 3 or 4 steaks instead of 2. Here's was I did:  -reduced balsalmic vinegar to 1/4 cup.  -used maple syrup instead of honey (didn't have any).  -omitted liquid smoke (didn't have any of that either).  -added 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  -used 2 NY strip steaks.    I only marinated them for about 4 hours, turning them after 2. I forgot to oil the grate but it was fine since there was oil in the marinade. Lastly, I simmered the marinade in a small pot until it thickened up and put it on top of the steaks. mm-mm-mmmmm :)

OMG!!! This was so good! It was the most exquisite concoction of flavors I have ever tasted. My sisters and I used this marinade for some steak we made for our parents for valentine's day and they absolutely loved it. They said it was better than any steak they had from restaurants. We followed the directions exactly but instead of cooking on the grill we put it in the over on 400 degrees for about 45 minutes. It was juicy and excellent!

Very good marinade, a little on the sweet side for me, so will cut back on the honey next time. Only marinated for about 3.5 hrs, then grilled it. Came out moist, flavorful and tender (I also used sirloin) Thanks for sharing, Angie !!! :)

Excellent. I was a bit wary of the 3 tablespoons of garlic, so I only used 2, but I think the original amount would have been just fine. I only marinated for 5 hours and the steak was extremely flavorful and grilled beautifully. Thanks! :)

I used this recipe for some Omaha top sirloin steaks. I left them in the marinade for 6 hours and that was just right for eight 4 oz steaks.

These steaks turned out absolutely fabulous!  I had been wanting to make some good steaks lately, so I'm glad I used this recipe for marinating.  I marinated them for about 36 hours in a ziploc bag, which works better for me than a pan.  I followed the recipe almost the same, however, I pan fried the steaks on medium heat for 30 mins, and used garlic powder instead of onion powder (as I didn't have any onion powder). Thanks for this recipe!

This was FABULOUS! I am forever in search of great marinades and this was by far one of the best that I have tried from this site. I used reduced sodium soy sauce, didn't add any salt and used brown sugar instead of honey. I marinated this for about 26 hours. Next time, I'll probably marinate my steaks for longer to get more of the fabulous flavor from the marinade. No steak sauce needed with this steak! Thank you Angie!

I thought it was pretty tasty but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't use the exact cut of steak listed and also didn't have any smoke flavoring. I also only marinated them for about 2 hours. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly because it was overall tasty but I think it needs to be followed more closely.

I thought the flavor of this marinade was absolutely wonderful!  The steaks were tender and delicious and even the kids gobbled it up.  For those of you who don't care for the pungent and stronger flavor of balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar makes a milder but equally delicious substitute.

Excellent!  Did not have liquid smoke and used sirloin steaks, marinated about 8 hours.  My husband loves Montreal steak seasoning and was wary about trying something new, but he loved it! Thanks!
Edit 1/3/17: Used strip steaks, marinated 5 hours.  Skipped oil and liquid smoke.  Seared, then grilled.  Poured remaining marinade into hot skillet and added a splash of red wine and cornstarch/water mix to thicken.  Added sauce made steaks even better!

Thanks Angie! My husband and I loved our tender, juicy and mouth-watering rib eye steaks! He raved that this was the best steak he'd had--ever! I only marinated them for just over an hour in the fridge, and I can't imagine the results if I had done this overnight. Also, I did not have the smoke flavoring, but did not miss it after "smoking" our 1 1/2 pound steaks for about 8 minutes on each side on our gas grill. Be sure to use a med-high heat and watch--I seared both sides at this heat for about 6 or 7 minutes each, then turned down to low and closed the lid for another minute or two. YUMMY!!

All around good recipe, but a little too vinegary for me, too.  I used top sirloin about 1/2 inch thick, marinated for 24 hours (starting frozen), and it came out very, very strong, so 48 hours may be too long for a thinner piece of meat.  If you like a tart marinade with a really strong kick, you'll love this recipe!

having had this recipe last summer, not kowing how it was prepared, i had been looking for a recipe that even came close, and then i found this one, and...there you go, it was it! this has got to be about the best steak on the grill we have ever eaten, and we do eat steak!  i was so impressed with this site, and all recipes, but finding this recipe, just made my year.  you added a few things, that seemed to be missing from others that i worked with, and somehow the taste and flavor never was exact. i will no longer have that problem. your recipe gets top billing with us.

My picky daughter loved this! Her exact words were, "I'm lucky you found this!" The only thing I omitted was the cayenne pepper. I marinated New York Strip for about 3 hours, seared and broiled it. Delicious-definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious! Wonderful flavor, but not overpowering. I used it on sirloin and marinated it for 9 hours. Perfect! Great compliment to steak, or chicken or pork! Thank you, Angie for sharing!

We left out the soy and added a little more Worcestershire Sauce and it was excellent!  Highly recommend this marinade especially for lesser cuts of steak but, BOY did it make our Filet Mignon stand out!

This marinade is outstanding!!!  I didn't have any liquid smoke so will get some and try it marinade again.  I plan to try marinating chicken as well as other cuts of beef.  I served sauted red and green pepper, onion, mushrooms and garlic and when they were crisp tender I added about 1//4 cup of balsamic vinegar and brought to temperature.  The balsamic tied the two dishes nicely.  Great hit

Yum! I used this on sirloin tips, which I cooked in a cast iron pan (grill not working) and they were the best ever.  Only change was to sub about 2 tbsp minced shallot instead of the onion powder because I was out and had half a shallot left over.  Seriously, best marinade ever!  Thanks for sharing, Angie!

Wow this was such a quick and easy marinate. I let my steaks marinate for 30-45 mins, then broiled them because its too cold and rainy to use the grill. This turned out to be one of the best steaks I have every made. I did not change a thing on the recipe and it turned out to be the right balance of seasoning. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Marinated for 2 days which is a good time - steak nice and juicy and tenderised. But way too salty. Can't taste the honey. A bit too much vinegar.

My adult 'kids' seemed to like it, but for me I thought the soy was too strong.  I tried to follow the recipe, although I didn't have enough garlic and maybe that's what was lacking.

Well, this was not a hit in our house, although I really liked it, but DH told me it wasn't a keeper; he found the balsamic vinegar overpowering and made the meat taste "gamey".  I'm keeping it anyway but will only likely make it for myself when he's away.

I guess I just like the flavor of a good grilled steak.  This recipe is tasty, but the marinade is not a compliment to the beef flavor, it is a cover-up.  I don't think I'll make it again.

Mmmmm.  A delicious marinade; even better when used on a well-marbled piece of steak.  Didn't taste sweet at all to me ... seemed like the perfect blend of flavors.  Yum!

OMGoodness talk about delicious! I followed the exact recipe ingredients except I used 4 New York steaks and marinated them in a plastic bag only for 4 hours. Instead of using a barbecue grill I used an electric range.  I  fried with a little butter in one of those shallow frying pans with the grill marks in it.  My husband who is a firm believer that a steak should be cooked only on a grill was floored and said it had such "wonderful flavors"!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We were not fond of this marinade.  The ingredient list looks great so I was suprised not to like it.  I only used 1/4 cup of the vinegar and there was still too much of a vinegar taste for us.  Wasn't fond of the sweetness either.  I think I would prefer sweet with chicken rather than beef. I marinated for 24 hours.

Great recipe!!! I use it everytime I make steak; it cooks well on the George Forman...and I can only imagine how good it would be on the actual BBQ....Yummmy!!! I usually marinade for just one hour. Tip: never poke holes in your meat...it will leave your finished product dry and hard instead of juicy and flavorfull!!

This was just ok. I think the liquid smoke was a bit much for me. Would maybe try again and leave that out. I think I bought the wrong cut of meat also, as it was pretty tough (and I didn't cook too long.)

This marinade was OK.  I just didn't think it had that much of a deep rich flavor that I was hoping for.  I used filet mignons and marinated for two days.  I also poked holes in the meat so the marinade could penetrate the steak.  Won't make again.

Fantastic marinade can be used on pork and chicken as well. I have used this marinade more times than I can count and wouldn't change a thing. On occasion I have left out the liquid smoke (ran out) and the marinade is still fantastic. Thanks for the great recipe Angie!

This was hands down the best steak marinade that we ever tasted! I've passed this on to everyone I know. Wow! I didn't change a thing and followed the recipe exactly.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this marinade! He made "Mmmm" sounds all through the meal! I didn't actually try it as I don't eat a lot of red meat but next time I make it I will be sure to try it! Thanks for posting the recipe! :D

This was an exceptional marinade even with a short two hour marination.  I will definitely try the full 24 hour version.  Reserved some of the marinade and added to mushrooms sauteed in butter and olive oil.  Yum!

"I just had what may have been the best steak of my life," -- boyfriend. I don't give five stars often, but that is a five-star comment!  Our plans changed, so the steaks marinaded for almost three days. They were so tender they were falling apart on the grill. The flavor was amazing. I didn't, and wouldn't, change a thing. We'll be grilling these many more times this summer.

This recipe created an ok tasting steak. I had marinated the steak for one night and the flavor was good but a little more intense than I would like. The balsamic vinegar was very apparent and part of me really liked the flavor it impacted but at the same time, it left little room for the beef taste to shine through. Next time I will either try adding less vinegar or marinating the steaks for only 4 hours. I did some research on how to prepare steaks after trying this recipe and learned that to achieve restaurant style results, the grade of the meat should be prime which is hard for the average consumer to get at a supermarket (only 2% of all beef production in USA is prime grade and they're almost exclusively sold to restaurants) and restaurants age their beef to get that full tenderized and flavored effect. A good steak also don't require much seasoning and needs to cooked in VERY high temperatures. Anyway I learned some pretty good tips from the internet and realized I might never be able to reproduce the good steaks I've had at restaurants. I had omitted the smoke liquid because I didn't have any and the flavor was still pretty good.

Excellent.  Meat was juicy and very good!  Had a great flavor.  I used white wine vinegar instead of balsamic because I didn't have any and it still turned out excellent.

I have been using this marinade for a couple of years now and decided to finally write a review. I have made this for multiple people with various types of steaks and have had nothing but rave reviews. I've had multiple people ask me for the recipe. When I made the marinade, I don't use the liquid smoke just because I am not a fan of it. Sometimes I use half the honey and other times I don't use honey at all. I think I prefer it without the honey. Also, the marinade times have been different. There have been times when I have used my foodsaver and put the steak and marinade together and food saved it and then froze it for a week, marinaded it for a couple of days, and even marinaded it for an hour. All of come out excellent. This is definitely my favorite marinade!

This was delicious!!!  I needed a recipe for a last minute BBQ and while I only got to marinate the steaks for 4 hours it was worth it.  I poked holes in my steak with a fork so it would soak up the juices better.  Next time I'll be more prepared and marinate this longer.  YUM!

Pretty good, but a little salty.  Since the soy sauce provided plenty of salt, I will hold the salt next time.

This marinade is quite interesting. I didn't use the liquid smoke but everything else I followed to a T - marinading for about 8 hours. My first bite was ok, this is different, kind of tangy, very moist - I like it but not sure I love it. Half way through the steak it was like I couldn't get enough of the flavour - it just grew on me so quickly and after every bite that after taste just made me desire another piece. haha. I was in love by the end. Thanks for the great recipe.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!!!  I made this for a dinner party with friends and everyone raved.  Made it true to recipe except didn't have onion powder so i chopped some shallots instead.  Flavor was WONDERFUL!  I made this with Roasted Asparagus and Mushrooms and Garlic Herbed Mashed potatoes.  One of the best dinners I have ever made.

OMG!! I have made this marinade for a full tenderloin twice and I have been told by everybody that it was the best tenderlion they have ever had. I make it just as is... except I do add alot more garlic and I added dried thyme (tastes so great with steak). I just add a dash of the cayanne. I was going to leave out the liquid smoke, but added it just to see, and I have to say it truly rounds out the flavors in this. It is not too noticable. You are missing out by not adding it. I doubled this recipe for the full tenderloin, I also poured some marinade in the pan while cooking. Also, balsamic vinegar is sooo smooth, and it does not leave a bite at all. This marinade did not taste bitter at all to me. Balsamic vinegar is a must! No substitutions! It is now my signature tenderloin recipe and I am making it tomorrow for my sisters birthday dinner. She said she daydreams about this! LOL. Awesome recipe! Thanks!

These were good, very flavorful. I added a few extra spices and accidentally over cooked them on the GF Grill. Still tender =0) I only got to marinade for 1 hour. I think the vinegar was a little too strong for our tastes; next time I'll just reduce it. Also I'll try marinating the recommended time. Thanks for the post!!!

If I could give this 10 stars I would! Awesome marinade. It's hard for me to eat a plain steak after having this marninade. I used filets and it came out so tender and juicy and full of flavor. I will definitely use this again and again! Thanks!

These steaks were SO GOOD!  We marinated two sirloin steaks for over 24 hours and then grilled them.  The best steak I've ever had!  They were tender, juicy, and so flavorful.  I added a few tablespoons of water to the leftover marinade, boiled it, and drizzled it over Sour Cream and Chive Mashed Potatoes (from this site).  Great combo.  I used low-sodium soy and omitted the salt and liquid smoke.  My kids loved these too, especially my two-year old.

I used this marinade on some left over top round steaks that were on the tough side.  This marinade was so incredible!  The steaks were incredibly flavorful and less tough.  My husband noted that each bite he took was better than the last.  We will definitely use this recipe again.

Great combination of ingredients.  We finally had a warm enough day where we could grill outside.  Made accordingly but only used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar (that was all I had) but it worked out well.  My husband asked me to use this one again.  Thanks

I marinated and grilled some ribeyes using this recipe exactly as given, except for the smoke flavoring, which I don't care for, and it turned out excellent. I grilled them over lump hardwood charcoal and LOVED the results. This is in my recipe box and will be used again, and again, and again.....

We've now made this several times-both with NY strips (which were excellent) as well as Ribeyes (wonderful as well).  We LOVE this recipe, as does everyone who we grill it for,and they always ask for the recipe.  My husband likes it with the Ribeyes better (I don't usually care for them) and I like it with NY strips better.  We always take care to tenderize the meat well and they turn out wonderful and tender every time.  Sometimes I don't have as much time to marinate them and end up doing it around 7 or 8 hours, but they always turn out great!  Thank you!

Excellent marinade! The first time I tried it, I altered the recipe a little (but still marinaded for 2 days)- due to some of the reviews about the vinegary taste and so forth. And it turned out okay, but nothing incredible... my husband didn't even say anything! Then I tried it again a few days later when we had some of my hubby's friends over. This time I followed it exactly how it said (except we used a thick pot roast from Vons- which is normally about $12 but only about $4 with your Vons card!- and I was only able to marinade the meat for about 20 min.) and it turned out INCREDIBLE! All of our guests raved about how excellent the marinade tasted and how tender and juicy the meat was! It really tasted restaurant quality! I will definately be using this recipe again. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!  I actually used it on boneless pork tenderloins, and it was delicious!  I used molasses instead of honey, the meat had a nice, carmelized quality.  I also added a touch of ground ginger, and skipped the salt (I alway do with any recipe calling for soy sauce).  This recipe makes alot of marinade, I marinated 4 boneless tenderloins and had about 2/3 cup left over.  This would easily marinate 4-6 steaks, especially if you use the zip-lock bag method.  I will be using this on my beef tenderloins for my Father's day mixed grill.

WOW! This is DELICIOUS! It is both sweet and tangy. I made this exactly to recipe and it was out of this world. We marinated for 24 hours. For those that complain that it is too sweet or too vinegary, what do you expect? If you want to cut back on ingredients fine, but don't blame the recipe when the tastes live up to the ingredients! This made our sirloins very tender. We absolutely adore this and so appreciate a marinade that has a bite to it! We will make this again and again for years to come. Thank you so much Angie for being unselfish and sharing this recipe! Update - I did make it with half the balsamic vinegar, it is also very delicious and toned down. It is up to you as to your tolerance for b.v. :)

Totally delish!!!  Everyone raved with such comments as "like in a restaurant", and "Oh. My. God." , and "I don't know when I've enjoyed a steak this much!"  I made the marinade in  a zip lock bag; packed it with frozen steaks in a cooler; went away for the weekend; marinated them all day as the steaks thawed out.  Topped 'em with sauteed onions& peppers.  Great dinner w/ sauteed broccoli, garlic, & olives.

i marinated for two days, because i wasn't planning on using the steaks for two days anyway so i figured, 'why not just let them sit in a marinade?' They were fantastic.  SO juicy and flavorful. I served them with garlic mashed potatos and steamed asparagus.

This marinade tasted great on rib-eye steaks. I followed the recipe exactly and I marinated them for about and hour and they were great. My husband said that the steaks tasted like they were made at a restaurant. I will use this recipe again, thank you!

WOW!!!  I marinaded black angus filet mignons for 24 hours (the only change I made was replaced the liquid smoke with A1 steak sauce)and then cooked on grill. If you love steak this is FANTASTIC!!  You can actually cut the steak with your fork.

Absolutely wonderful!  We tried it on NY strips and marinated about 6 hours.  We followed the recipe "as is" and it was perfect.  The only thing I might try differently the next time is to leave out the liquid smoke and use a smoker box w/ wood chips in the grill.

This was my try at making steak of any sort so I was open to ideas. I followed the recipe exactly. Although the steak was very juicy, I felt there was too much soy sauce flavor and too much vinegar. Not enough flavor of herbs etc. Dont think I will be trying this one again....

I didn't have enough time to marrinate the steaks longer than 2 hours (if that), but from previous experiences, I know that if I had marrinated the steaks longer they would have tasted even better.  I felt the taste of the honey was kind of strong, but I'm sure that is probably the only thing that had enough time to settle into the steak.  I didn't use soy sauce, because no matter what kind of marrinate recipe I use, I cannot stand the taste of soy sauce in my steaks.  I opted to use seasoned salt when I put them on the grill instead.  They turned out good, but again, I would suggest that you marrinate the steaks for at least 8-24 hours to get them to taste great...anything less than that will make them taste mediocre.

The best marinade ever!  We used it on tri-tip steaks and let them marinade for 3 days and then BBQ them.  They came out so tasty!  Everyone loved them.  This will be the only steak marinade I will ever use again.

I quadrupled this recipe and used it to marinate 9 pounds of tip roast sliced into steaks.  It was fantastic.  Very flavorful and juicy.  Everyone loved it.

I also added some habanero sauce to a portion for those who like spicier food (including me) and it was even better.

Although this marinade certainly made the steaks very tender, I thought the flavor was a bit overpowering.  Also, it gave hubby & I heartburn and I NEVER get heartburn.  I think I'll stick to my own marinade.

We loved our steaks so much, some of us threw their table manners out the window and picked the T bone  from their plate and start biting any meat left on .. ! I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, so I used white vinegar , but just half the amount called for  with a touch of sugar, as it is more acidic than balsamic vinegar. Also  marinated for 8 hours only. I will be using this marinate often.

Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks Haiku: "Made for Father's Day, marinated rib-eye steaks for about two days." Sometimes a good hunk of beef should be prepared near-virginal w/ a little EVOO, S&P, and sometimes a so-so piece of meat really benefits from a long tender bath in a marinade. My husband and I agreed that a nice rib-eye didn't need quite this much over-kill. The marinade itself is very, very flavorful and I will absolutely use it again (perhaps reducing the balsamic vinegar a tad), but just not on a good steak.

Loved loved loved this recipe.  It did wonderful things to my steak and everyone in the family agreed.  Very elegantly noted.  I only had a couple hours to marinate and it still worked out great.  I am very interested in marinating overnight now.

This was really amazing. I used pressed garlic rather than minced, and loved the outcome. It was both sweet and savory, which I love. We only marinated for about three hours, but the flavor was distinctive. I doubled the recipe, and froze the extra. Next time I plan to try a full 24-hour marination process.

Very tasty marinate.  I had a London broil and used a cutting fork to put very small holes in the steak. Very nice marinate for (Cheap?)cuts.

Great on ribeyes!

Besides omitting the honey, the recipe was followed exactly. Allowed steaks to marinade for two days, flipping every 12 hours. Leftover marinade was simmered on the grill and reduced by half, with a couple tablespoons of ketchup added after being removed from the heat. Steaks were topped with homemade cayenne-garlic butter with the marinade reduction on the side. Paired the steak with cream cheese and butter mashed potatoes. 

Definitely a keeper!

One of the best steak recipe I have tried so far. I marinated for about 3 hour before cooking and used Sirloin. With Greek potatoes on the side, it was just perfect. See the Picture!

I made this for my boyfriend, sister, and brother-in-law and it was amazing. Marinated our ribeyes for about 2 hours and it was PERFECT.  I have tried several steak marinades lately and this was the best.

This recipe was delicious, my husband whos very picky when it comes to his steak Absolutely loved it and my mother-in-law who never eats when I cook absolutely raved about it as well. However i baked the steaks oppose to grilling it due to weather, i placed it in the broiler part of the oven 3 mins on one side and about 8 mins on the other and it came out perfect , medium-well . This recipe was amazing, steaks came out soft and tender. I will never eat steak at a resturant now because this was just to good, definitly will be mking it again.

The marinade was pretty good, which is a good thing, since it overpowered the taste of the steak. I can't say I'll make this again. When I want a steak, I want it to taste like a steak.

Used thin marinating steaks and only soaked in marinade for about 15 minutes before cooking.  Turned out fantastic!

The marinade itself was great had a great flavor, however it didn't tenderize the steaks or really bring the beef flavor out.

This is a great marinade!  I didn't have any liquid smoke (haven't been able to find it in small town Germany grocery stores) and it was still delicious!  Great on the grill or in the pan.

Yum.  The sauce it made was Yum too.  I gave it a 4 star because I  cut the balsamic vinegar by half and didn't marinade as long as it said to.  I only had 20 minutes.  Still yum.

The flavors in this recipe lend themselves to a nice beef jerky, not for steak.  Especially not for a good cut of steak.  It's not that I didn't like the flavors of this marinade, it's just that it overwhelms the natural flavors of grilled beef.

We love cooking on the grill and needed a new recipe for steak. We weren't disappointed, but have to agree with the other reviewers that you shouldn't marinate in this longer than overnight. Due to a change in plans (impromptu dinner out with family!), we left it in for 1-1/2 days! Although it was still tasty, the vinegar did get a little overpowering. but that was our mistake, no fault of the recipe. We will definitely try this again, maybe this time with a tri-tip!  OH, and definitely try this steak with some red wine. After my initial taste bud shock over the vinegar, I took a sip of wine (a box brand, no less! No fancy wine) and WOW, the flavors really came out! Delish.

Made Ribeyes with these last night; they were REALLY tender (of course, the Ribeye is a great cut of meat anyway); I plan to try later with a cheaper cut.

Did not enjoy the combination of flavours from vinegar, soy sauce, and liquid smoke.  All are too strong and don't mix well.  Was just OK for me.

SO GOOD! Just ate this for dinner! I started this last night!, this morning I flipped it over to merinate the other side, and then cooked it for dinner just now! I added about a teaspoon of dijon mustard as well. Didnt have Worcestershire sauce so i subbed in A1 steak sauce, and I didnt use cayenne pepper, liquid smoke flavoring, or onion powder. Super juicy and I really enjoyed this! Will be using it again!

I marinated 1.5 days. I cut the marinade in half and it was more than plenty for two steaks. I hate throwing aways huge amounts of marinade.  It was still a little salty, but good.  The cook time made ours almost well done.  ugh.

This was very good.  I marinated it overnight and followed the recipe with the exception of the soy sauce since I was out.  I tried hoisin sauce since I had that on hand and it turned out great.  I will try this again with the soy sauce.

It was very vinegary - I put the meat on my baby greens to make it make sense.

this was a really good marinade. made the steaks very tender and very tasty. the only thing i was missing was the cayenne pepper which i'm sure would have only made them better

Great marinade.  My family usually will only eat steak naked and everyone loved it.  Dinner plans changed and this ended up sitting in the marinade for a few days tather than overnight.  Thought it would end up being too overpowering and ruin it, but it was wonderful.

I made this for my husband for a very special dinner, now it's a usual and necessary marinade. I've found that marinating for the 2 days works the best. There is SO much flavor...it's AMAZING

I've used this marinade twice and both times it got rave reviews. I didn't have any liquid smoke and so I used 1 tsp of sesame oil instead. My son's friend proclaimed it the best piece of meat he's ever had!

Must agree with Mark that previusly posted regarding flavor.  There was no marinade flavor that came through with the exception of a very small hint of the liquid smoke.  The steak was quite tender I  suspect not due to the marinade, but to the high grade of meat purchased by my husband.  Still searching for that elusive robust steak marinade.

This marinade is great! The balsamic/Worcestershire/liquid smoke combination is really enjoyable and is refreshingly different from the typical steak marinade. We used petit sirloins and marinated for just a few hours and the meat was very flavorful.

This was VERY good. I made the recipe as written minus the liquid smoke. I don't have a grill so I had to use the George Foreman but it was just as good. My husband and I ate it all up. So, I will definitely be making this again, next time with more steaks.

One of our favorite steak marinades is a simple mix of 1/2 olive oil, and 1/2 soy sauce, so I was excited to try this recipe with a little more variety.  We really liked it!  I may back off the vinegar a little bit, as the first bite was a little overwhelming.  But overall, we will definitely use it again.

Very very good. I did things a tad different though, I followed the marinating recipe but instead of steaks I did Pork Chops (boneless). I marinated them for about 2 hours, didn't grill them either (no charcoal) so I stuck them in the oven at 350 degrees. I put them in a glass dish poured some of the marinade over them covered dish with aluminum foil, stuck in the over for 30 min, took them out flipped them put more marinade one them, cooked them for another 15 minutes before they were done. Absolutely amazing, Marinade will be a keeper, can't wait till try it on other things  :D

This recipe is insanely incredible!!!  I used New York strips because ribeyes were outrageously priced and it was the most tender, tasty steak I've had in eons.  And I only had it marinating for about nine hours!  Highly recommended!!

This was a pretty good marinade.  We had some leftover New York strip steaks that were pretty tough thrown straight on the grill.  I threw them in this marinade (using only 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar as others suggested) and it really helped.  The steaks were more tender and tasty.  This is a good marinade to spice up some bland red meat.

AWESOME. I've used this several times and it's become a regular addition to my family's menu. We also use a bit of the leftover marinade by sauteing up some mushrooms and onions, adding a bit of the marinade, and then reducing it. YUM!

First time reviewer, because I had to say that this marinade made my London Broil so juicy and tender, I could not believe it.  My husband, who only likes a New York Strip, happily wolfed this down with rave reviews.  I used the suggestions of scoring the steak and piercing it with a fork to let the marinade absorb and grilled it.  It was perfect.

Wow! Awesome steaks!! If I could give this a 10 plus stars I would. This steak was moist, juicy and tender and was absolutely delicious! I cannot wait to make this again. Perfect marinade and wonderful meal. I served this with, "Asparagus with Parmesan Crust, "also from this website.

Just used this recipe tonight!  We usually marinate everything in a teriyaki sauce, and tonight I decided to try something different bc it was my husband's birthday. This marinade is A-MAZ-ING!!!  Both my husband and I absolutely loved it!  We marinated it for only 30 minutes on kinda thin (1 inch thick) top sirloins, and it turned out great.

I reduced the balsamic vinegar down to 1/4 c. i found 1/2 c a little overwhelming and I increased the soy to 1/2 cup . I use low sodium soy sauce. Great marinade. I microwaved the marinade for 1 min just to warm up and only marinaded ribeye for about 45 min

A-mazing, I could not stop saying "are you serious". The name does not do it justice. It is the best steak I ever had. I made two minor changes that cut the sodium down by a third. I used low sodium soy sauce and did not add the salt, there was no need to. Bravo, my hats off to the chef.

I prepared this ahead of time and froze for a meal later in the week. I used fresh onion because it was what I had on hand. The boyfriend loved this. His plate was clean. Even the fat was gone! Apart from using fresh onion vs. the powder, DO NOT CHANGE A THING.

Me and my two brothers had a cook off last weekend.  I'm such a novice at cooking.  They cook by taste.  I followed this recipe and blew them out of the water.  These steaks were gone in 5 minutes.  I made (9) 16oz steaks.  They are still eating their leftovers.  People were sucking the bone.  And I can't really cook.  I might try it with brown sugar next.

Absolutely the best steak marinade I have ever made. I followed to a T, and marinaded for 20 hours before grilling. So, so very good! I do recommend using a good quality balsamic vinegar as it is a must to get the best flavor. Definitely a keeper!

GREAT MARINADE RECIPE... it is one of the better marinades I have tried.... I used rib steaks instead of rib-eyes because we have our own beef butchered... the difference is they have a little more fat on the edge and the bone still in... I marinated them for 24 hours and also used fresh onion instead of onion powder.... which grilled up nicely on tin foil and tasted great over the steaks which were incredibly juicy and flavorful... and it wasn't too much garlic like I first thought... TASTES GREAT

We really enjoyed this!!  I’ve made it twice now.  Once with a flat iron steak, and once with filets.  I made half of this recipe, which I thought was plenty of marinade for a pound of meat.  I realize that the title of the recipe is Savory GARLIC Marinated Steaks, but I would add the garlic to taste.  The first time I made this I used the refrigerated garlic in a jar, but the second time I used fresh – HUGE DIFFERENCE.  The fresh is so much stronger, so keep that in mind when adding the garlic.  We are garlic lovers, but next time I’ll cut back on the amount.  This recipe is worth repeating!!  UPDATE 6/25/12:  I again made 1/2 of this recipe and used 3 cloves of garlic - perfect!

This came out just OK for me.  Balsomic vinegar is a very strong component in this recipe.  I think I will try this again, but cut that particular ingredient by half.

Delicious. I only had about a 1/4 cup balsamic so I used 1/4 cup white vinegar mixed to make a full 1/2 cup. The taste was fantastic. It was like a thinner version of A-1 sauce and it made the steak so tender!

I tried this recipe this evening and wow was it good.  I could taste the vinger a bit more then anything else, but it was mild.  So I will tweak it a little next time by using a mix of vingers.  I did taste it before using it on my steaks and it was a little strong so I did add about a T of brown sugar to take a bit of the tang down.  Maybe I'll add a little more next time.  This is a keeper though and I will use it again on more cuts of meat

I tried this out on some NY steaks. I didn't have the 1-2 days to marinate (I can't plan ahead like that) so I followed another reviewer and pricked the steaks all over with a fork and then marinated for 2 hours. The results were absolutely wonderful! DH made me swear that we would use this recipe as often as possible!

I love this marinade, I use it everytime I grill rib-eye or t-bone steaks, you don't even need steak sauce! Marinate them a day or two & they will taste great! I don't add the smoke-flavor but it doesn't seem to matter.

This is an exceptional marinade. I only had time to marinade steak about 4 hours and it was still delicious.  I do cut the vinegar by 1/2.  I feel it would be too strong for my taste if I use the full amount.  Also I cook my steak 2 minutes on 1 side and 3 minutes on the other side.  Try this recipe...you will not be disappointed!!!!

My husband the A-1 lover (on everything not just the steak) didn't even touch it while eating his marinated steak tonight.  He just sat there with his eyes closed eating in silence.  Since I don't eat red meat I can't really tell if what I've made is good or not...there is no guessing with this recipe.  My son (15months) didn't like red meat either and of course my husband was upset but that changed tonight.  He ate up a fair amount.  Thank you so much for the GREAT recipe.  I followed the recipe as is and marinated two nights.

This marinade is fantastic!  My kids love it and although it is a little sweet, we tend to add extra cayenne to spice it up just a little.  It is especially good on venison. I've served it for people that really don't like venison, but they do now.

This made a very tasty steak. The first time I made this, I marinated for 24 hours and it was great. The second time, I tried 48 hours and didn't like it as much. I'll be sticking to the 24 hours from now on.

Delicious! My husband claimed it was the best steak I've made yet! I left out the smoke and used dried minced onion instead of onion powder. I also only marinated for 5 hours, but I tenderized the meat and turned it every hour and it still turned out very tender. I'm saving this recipe for sure!

This marinade makes awesome beef jerky! I thin sliced a lean top round roast and marinated the slices overnight in a zip lock bag and dried them in my little inexpensive round dehydrator. TO DIE FOR!!(and a lot cheaper than storebought).

WOW!!! Absolutely wonderful! I only marinated the steaks for 6 hours and if they tasted this good, I cannot imagine how much better they would be if marinated for longer. I used round steak and it was the best I have ever tried.... better than any restaurant steaks!

This was an OK marinade, but I thought it overpowered the steak flavor. Maybe it would be good for someone who isn't crazy about steak.

These were great! Made exactly as Angie wrote! Would not change a thing. served with corn on the cob, garlic bread, and ranch/bacon pasta. My husband and children raved about what a good dinner I had made :)

I have used this recipe again and again.  I use smoked salt instead of liquid smoke but this recipe is an ace in the hole.  If you don't like it salty try a low sodium soy sauce.  I've never done it because we like our food a little salty but I might if I made this for company.  And I think this could also be a crowd pleaser.

This definetly had a good flavor but it is one that you would have to really be in the mood for.  If your looking for just a good steak marinade I wouldn't recommend.  However, if your looking for something a little different this is easy and tasty.

Holy Moly!! I made this for my husband's bday dinner and he said it was part of the best dinner he has ever had! I was very happy :) I served it with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto and Garlic Asparagus. I would definitely suggest this recipe. We have already used it again within the past month.

Not too bad. I marinated it for 6 hours. Used the recipe as written. The steaks were tender, but i would've prefer a more garlicky taste than this. It was a little to sweet tasting. Probably won't use this recipe again!

I did not like the recipe as it was, but here's how I took it from a 3 star to a 5 star that works for beef or pork! Leave out: honey, balsamic vinegar. A little less Worcestershire and liquid smoke. Add 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1 can beef broth, 1.5-2 times the soy sauce, a total of 6 full tbsp minced garlic. Follow the rest of the recipe and season to taste. If the marinade tastes yummy and salty before you put the meat in, it'll taste wonderful after marinating for a day or two. I've even gone three days if needed. Thanks for the base recipe!

I did not like this and I will be removing it from my recipe box.  I gave it 3 stars because my husband thought it was ok.  Too strong of flavors - I guess I don't like soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce very much.

This was great.  I think this marinade would be good on a variety of different steaks, although the prime rib-eye made for a special treat.  We marinated for over a day and the meat was so tender.  I didn't even need steak sauce.

We loved this recipe.  Used London Broil and left out the balsamic vinegar as I wasn't sure how old mine was.  Only marinated about an hour and it was still really tasty!

What a nice change up for a great cut of meat! I am old school at the grill (seasoned salt, PERIOD!) My wife requested a more exotic approch. What a nice supprise! Followed the directions to the letter and see no reason to change it up.

I found this recipe in an All Recipes cookbook.  We've used it many times, for all diferent cuts of steak.  I recently put it on tri-tip (a favorite of my husband's), because we haven't been able to get the right taste compared to meat he's eaten elsewhere.  We LOVED it.  It is the only marinade he wants me to use now, and it's the perfect flavor.  After making it many times, I now use only 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground pepper, Tabasco instead of cayenne, and onion flakes instead of onion powder.  I highly recommend marinating a MINIMUM of 24 hours, it makes a huge difference.  Thanks so much for sharing it with us, Angie, we're enjoying our summer steaks more than ever before because of this recipe.

Good recipe. A little salty, will not add the extra salt next time. Also could have been more garlic - all I tasted was balsamic vinegar! Will use brown sugar instead of honey next time as the honey did not incorporate into the mixture very well.

Very, very good.  Meat is tender, flavor is awesome.  Took the leftover marinate and boiled it\, serve it over grilled steaks w/onions & mushroom (pan fry on low w/black pepper & little olive oil).Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.

Fantastic. We marinated our rib-eye steaks overnight and they came out wonderfully. Definitely a taste of garlic and quite rich. A little tang, too! Very good, will be using again and again.

I think I would like parts of this marinade, but as a whole I did not like the flavor at all. It smelled fantastic, but it was too sweet and the sweet/savory combination was not good.  I think the balsamic vinegar and the honey is what I would take out and then I'd try the marinade again.

Excellent flavor and very tender results. I have used this marinade several times now. It's a lot like a Korean BBQ taste. I like to use this recipe for flank steak. I butterfly one side of the steak and marinade for a whole day (sometimes 2). Grill it and slice it and enjoy.

This was simple and had a nice flavor.  I let the steak marinate for 2 days in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator.  It was a cheaper cut of meat and I grilled it for 6 minutes (flipping it once) on my George Forman grill.  Very tender.

This made a lot of marinade, enough for at least 4 steaks.  As an aptartment dweller, I had to broil rather than grill, but it turned out delicious!

I thought this was excellent, but it was too tangy for hubby so I used the leftovers on top of a salad one day for lunch and for a steak & cheese sandwich the next.  I let it marinate for 2 days and left out the liquid smoke because I couldn't find it.  I would definately use this again, so thanks!

Followed the recipe and came out with incredibly flavorful, tender Strip loin steaks! Put the marinade in a zip-lock bag, mixed the marinade in a bowl and poured over the steaks in the bag. Let the bag sit for 2 days (while turning it from time to time). Seeing it's autumn, did them in a very hot iron skillet to sear (1 min each side) and then 2-3 min in same skillet in the oven at 350. HIGHLY recommended.

We had this last night and really enjoyed it.  Only had time to marinate it for a few hours.  We used 4 Delmonico's.  Definitely has a black pepper spiciness, so if you're not big on so much spice, you may want to cut back.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This marinade gives a great flavor to the meat.  It makes enough for twice as many steaks (at least) so be sure to scale down unless you are cooking for a group.

We only had an hour to marinate our T-bones, but it still tasted delicious.  I can't wait to try this and marinate for at least 24 hours.  I bought good quality beef, so it was tender and as if we went to a restaurant.  Even though we had an hour to marinate, we could taste the wonderful combination of flavors.

We made this on the 4th of July and it was great! We did not have any liquid smoke, so we left it out. We used wood chips on the grill, instead. We, also, did not marinate for 2 days. We marinated in a food saver canister for about 8 hours.

I tried this last night with some rib-eye steaks we picked up from an organic butcher and no-joke, this was easily the best tasting steak, I've ever had.
The marinade was also quite easy, I unfortunately did not have the soy sauce on hand (so I skipped it) or the onion powder and just substituted with garlic salt. Also instead of marinating this for the 2 days the recipe calls for, I took the recommendation of another reviewer and microwaved the marinade for a minute and then doused the steaks with it and let it sit for an hour at room temperature. 
The steaks came out fantastically - this recipe is a keeper!

I made this for father's day dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not save any for basting.  I let marinate for 2 days and all I can say is:  HOLY COW!  My company was RAVING, saying it was better than going to a restaurant - which I take as a HUGE compliment.  I was also told this is by far the best dinner I've ever made.  I also made (all from this site):  yummy honey chicken kabobs, marinated shrimp, spinach and strawberry salad and alyson's broccoli salad..  all a huge hit.  Even my picky kids gobbled it up!

The amounts seem to be off--the stated amounts are enough for four of my steaks, but that's a minor quibble. This is a very good marinade. I served the grilled steaks with rice and steamed green beans tossed in soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and sesame seeds. It makes a perfect, easy meal.

I can't think of any cut of meat that should be marinated for 2 days - I think a few hours is fine, otherwise you risk the meat becoming mushy. Great flavor and super easy - I had all the ingredients in my pantry.  Two things I don't suggest though.  I decided to use big T-bone steaks, probably not the best choice, next time I'll use the suggested cut.  Also- do not prepare these inside.  I discovered too late that my grill was void of propane so decided to cook them stove top.  The marinade started to overcook creating  a lot of smoke and smell that lingered for hours.  Best to do these outside.

This is a keeper.  I felt cutting the recipe in half provided ample marinade and I even tossed 8 oz of whole mushrooms in the plastic bag along with the steak.  Then sauteed them in butter while steak cooked on the grill.  YUMMOOO !!

The best!!!!!  I used white balsamic vinegar and doubled the recipe for 6 filets - it was plenty.  Only marinated for 4 hours and it was great, not too strong.  I would probably half the recipe next time, I had way too much marinade.

I was a little concerned about the vinegar factor after reading some reviews, but it turned out to be quite good.  I only marinated for about 5 hours.  
I wish I hadd boiled down he extra marinade for a sauce, it was that good that you wanted to mop the steak with it.

OH..MY..GOSH!! This is the YUMMIEST marinade ever!! Love the tang from the vinegar, and the amt. of garlic was perfect!! I used some cubed "mock chuck" steak (that is what the pkg said), left out the liquid smoke(didn't have any), and added a tablespoon of dijon mustard (love mustard in marinades.) It has been sitting for 24hrs, just had a bite, and WOOOAH NELLY, this is heavenly!! The meat is soooo tender. Cooked it on the stove w/the marinade, added some mushrooms, broccoli, and served it over brown rice. Oh, and thickened it at the end w/1 T flour and some water, to make it more like a "gravy" over the rice. Try this, you'll be VERY happy you did!!

I made some slight variations to this recipe (omitted liquid smoke, used fresh onion and balsamic vinagrette dressing) and it still turned out wonderfully.  I marinated some strip loin overnight but next time I might let it go even longer.  The garlic and balsamic flavors were mellow and not overpowering at all.  Delicious, perfect flavor!

I have made this twice now and wasn't too thrilled the last time. I think my inferior choice of beef was to blame, though. If I make this again I will cut the vinegar in half and add more olive oil because it tasted a little too strong. I used some deliciously tender tri tip once, and the results were better but it still tasted a little too vinegar-ey. Thats what I get for buying cheap cuts of beef from the store instead of from my butcher!

Absolutely delicious!  I was a bit skeptical, because I don't usually like sweet on my meat, but these were great.  A keeper.  Oh yeah, it was 25 degrees outside when I was grilling these steaks but well worth it.  Thanks.

I recently made these because my husband had a taste for steaks.  I tripled the recipe to make 6 steaks and marinated these overnight.  It was too cold out to use the grill, so I broiled these to medium doneness and they were so tender, juicy and flavorful!  This recipe is a keeper!

Really tasty marinade but it almost covers up the taste of the expensive steak.  If don't like the taste of meat, this is a great marinade.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought the marinade was good but overpowered the flavor of the meat. This marinade is better for a tough, cheaper cut of beef.

This was a good marinade, but I think I'll leave the smoke flavoring out next time. It was a little strong and it overpowered the flavor of the meat.

Wow, marinated these 2 1/2 days for a houseboat trip and they were to die for.  It was served with sauteed Portabello mushrooms and "Red Skinned Potato Salad" from this site for a killer meal.

This marinade is outstanding! I've not had a steak this good in a 5 star resturant! We used 2)  2" thick tenderloin steaks. My husband is very picky, and I was worried he wouldn't care for these, but I was very wrong. I made a bernaise sauce to go on top, and it really complimented it nicely. I will be doing this marinade again....soon! Thought I might try it on a pork tenderloin too!

Very easy and tasted great. I doubled the recipe, tossed all in a ziplock bag and went to work. When I came home dinner was ready in no time. Tasted great, would not change a thing.

This marinade rocks! I love that you can throw your steaks in it about 30 minutes before you want to grill and they are so full of flavor. Awesome!

I added extra garlic to this recipe. It turned out absolutely great!  I had extra steaks left over (I doubled the recipe), and froze them in the marinade.  They were still juicy after being BBQ'd.

This marinade was delicious and made our steaks unbelievably tender!  I left out the liquid smoke because I didn't have any on hand and it was still delicious.  I put two frozen steaks in the marinade and let them thaw overnight and marinade through the day- this recipe is a keeper!

This is an awesome marinade.  The first time it turned out perfect.  The second time I only left it in the marinade for one night and it just wasn't enough.  I know now to keep it in the marinade for at least two nights.

Awesome recipe.  Changed it a bit and used Red Wine Vinegar.  Since I was grilling 4 steaks, I doubled recipe, but only used 3/4 cup of vinegar.  Also, used fresh sliced/chopped garlic - I think made all the difference.  Only marinated for about 8 hours and it was just right.  Any longer and I think the vinegar would have been too much.  Also, I used top sirloin (only steak I had) and it was very tasty.  All 3 kids & husband loved it.  I'll use this again for company.

I used this recipe on bal tip steak.I didn't have the liquid smoke flavoring but the flavor was great without it. I also used minced onion(crushed)  in place of onion powder.This was a great recipe and and will definitely be used over and over! Thanks.

I made a few small changes, 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, but everything else the same.  It was GREAT!  I marinated it for about 6 hours and it was good, but next time I will marinate longer.  I used this for a london broil.

Very good!  I only gave this 4 stars because we marinated the steaks for about 4 hours, and when they were done, they were perfect.  I can't imagine marinating these steaks any longer than that though or you might lose the flavor of the meat.  Otherwise, very tasty.

This was ok....it tasted just like what my dad used to marinate our fondue meat in, which was heinz 57 and red wine.  I guess I had higher expectations after all the rave reviews.  My husband really liked it though.

I love this marinade! We have used it on steak, on kabobs and on vegetables like zucchini, mushrooms and potatoes. Great on everything! We also made a double batch and added a little bit more honey and left out the oil. And then cooked it down on the stove as a dipping sauce for our steak/kabobs. Everyone loved it. You should definetly try this!

This marinade was making my mouth water at 5:30 in the morning after I made it when I was rotating the meat! This was a terrific recipe; I served it with baked potatoes and corn on the cob. Very quick and easy!

I have made this recipe MANY times, and always have great results.  The only changes are that I don't use liquid smoke and I use flank steak instead on rib eyes.  It is excellent on the grill or done under the broiler and the marinade compliments the flank steak perfectly!

Great!  Made this for my boyfriends birthday and he loved it! Marinated them for a little less than 24 hours. Omitted liquid smoke but kept everything else the same.  Also marinade could be used for more than 2 steak servings.

Hubby and son loved the flavor.  I wasn't fond of it only cause I love a steak for its natural flavor.  However, I might like it with a pork tenderloin.  It has an oriental taste and would go well with a stir fry. I used 4 rib eye steaks and they totaled 2.44 lbs. (more than twice the amount suggested) - this marinade covered and permeated them all well.

I marinated steaks for a number of people using sirloin, t-bone, and ribeye.  They all were great.  I cut the vinegar a bit but I'm sure the steaks would have tasted just as good with the full amount.  I also marinated for about a day and a half.  Very tender.

This was an excellent marinade.  I used deer steaks with it.  It tasted like a $25 dollar steak at a restaurant.

Delicious, and the most tender meat was the result. Can't wait to grill again with this recipe.

WOW! This marinade was excellent! I modified the recipe just a touch by reducing the amount of vinegar, using freshly ground black pepper, and replacing honey with molasses.  I reduced the left over marinade in a sauce pan and used it as a dipping sauce for the steaks. This meal was a huge hit in my house! Thanks for the great recipe!

As suggested by others we halved the honey and the balsamic vinegar. I don't eat read meat so I am going off what my husband says. He usually drowns everything in A1 but never touched the bottle with this steak. He said it was flavorful and juicy (marinated 6 hours). We used a thin cut ribeye and grilled over charcoal and hickory wood instead of using the liquid smoke. He said I could make the marinade again with only slight alterations. Thanks Angie for a great marinade.

I cannot believe that anyone would not like this recipe.  The meat was succulent, tender, and had a wonderful tangy sweet flavor.  Marinated 2 boneless rib-eyes that weighed a total of 20-1/2 oz. (after trimming) in 3/4 of the required marinate for 18-1/2 hours.  (I have always found that most recipes have you make much more marinate than necessary, and even this still seemed like too much.)  For my 3/4 recipe I cut back a little bit on the vinegar, black pepper, and salt, and used 1/3 regular soy sauce and 2/3 lite, and also 1/3 sesame oil for part of the olive oil.  I don’t know if marinating the steak longer would make it any more delicious, but next time I am going to find out!!!  I can't wait to try it with a flank steak, and my husband thinks that it might be good with pork too.  Do try this marinate!!!

04/28/2005: This recipe was great! Omitted the salt b/c I didn't use low sodium soy sauce. I also used red wine vinegar & added sugar in place of the balsamic vinegar.
My boyfriend and his VERY picky 5 yr old son loved it as well. We bought some A-1 just in case and didn't even open it! Even the marinade smelled great...made my mouth water just smelling it. This recipe is HIGHLY recommended!!

03/29/2014: Wow, it's been a while since I've updated the review on this one! The boyfriend turned into the husband! The first time we tried this recipe, it was amazing. We tried it again a few times and couldn't get it to come out the same, in fact it wasn't all that awesome the subsequent times.
I tried this out again a couple of days ago and it came out great. This time, we used NY Strip and I let it marinate in my foodsaver containers for 2.5 days. I cooked them on the HOT charcoal grill for only about 3-4 minutes per side as we like them medium rare. They still came out closer to medium but were so very flavorful. We are vinegar fans so this had just the right amount of tang for us. In the future, I'll probably see about trying different vinegars: apple cider, red wine, white distilled and see if we like any of those better. I have a feeling the red wine will still be our favorite with a tiny bit of sugar (or agave nectar) added. This recipe is still in the recipe arsenal and will stay there. I'm a simple steak person but it's nice to have something a bit different on occasion.

This recipe is definately a keeper.  It was still on the grill when my husband said that we would have to do it again for the aroma alone.  It kind of tasted like teryaki beef jerky, but it was very good.  I kept the recipe the same.

I made this for 2 serving and left it in the refrig. for 2 days and had a wonderful smell while cooking. I added about 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and alittle bit more of the liquid smoke flavoring. I also added some garlic powder. My outside grill was not working, so I made to cook it inside in the oven. I cooked it nice and slow. Don't know what to do with steak. Make this...I can't wait to have a dinner party in the summer. This is a make again. My husband finished it and wanted more. Make sure you make extra. I made it with garlic bread and mashed potatoes and corn. Excellent dinner A+

OHHH sooooo Good! My guests loved this too. I marinated the steaks ( I did 6 and tripled the recipe ) for 2 days. I had run out of olive oil so I used 1/2 sesame oil instead. Instead of balsamic vinegar I used red wine vinegar. Course grnd black pepper made this perfect.

This is an awesome marinade for steaks!  I used it with some skirt steaks and they came out fabulous.  Even though the recipe says to marinade the meat for 1-2 days, you can do it for only a few hours and they still come out great!  I will never look for another marinade again.

We loved this recipe.  I substituted red wine vinegar for the balsamic vinegar, and reduced the amount of vinegar to 1/3 of a cup.  We also added a little extra garlic.we used minced onion instead of onion powder.  Overall, excellent flavor.

This was absolutely delicious.  I marinated the steaks the first time for only a few hours and they came out great.  The second and third time I used the marinade, they sat over night and were great, too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was pretty good but not quite what I was looking for.  I marinated the T-bone steak for 24 hours in shallow dish and fliped the steak over after about 12 hours. I don't think I will use this recipe again. I do like to try new recipes but this one didn't quite work for me.

I use this marinade everytime we grill steaks now, we love it.  I do reduce the vinegar to 1/4 cup, and garlic (which I love) to 2 TBSP.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of the revisions I have made to the recipe.

MMMMmmmmmmm!!!  I loved this marinade.  I left out the smoke flavoring and the cayenne as I didn't have any...and it was still delicious.  I will probably cut down a bit on the garlic next time (perhaps 2 or 2 1/2 T instead of the 3T listed).  I used 2 sirloin steaks, marinated them for 24 hrs and they grilled up beautifully.

Pretty good recipe.  I marinated for 24 hours and cooked it under the broiler.  The steak was tender and flavorful, but the vinegar taste seemed to dominate a bit too much.  Next time I would cut the balsamic by maybe a third.

Made for Valentine's day. This was my first time making steak. We got a great-looking cut of ribeye: very red, and marbled with a significant amount of fat. Followed the recipe exactly, using "hickory" flavored liquid smoke, and a somewhat expensive italian balsamic vinegar. Marinated ~20 hours in a Ziplock baggie with two steaks before cooking on an indoor grill. It was so fantastically delicious that we made the recipe again the next day (we had bought the family four-pack of ribeye) and enjoyed it just as much. Very highly recommended!

I tried this marinade with flank steak and broiled the steaks about 7 minutes per side. It came out so delicious! The garlic flavor really comes out! The little kick from the Worcestershire and cayenne pepper balances out the slight sweetness of the honey and balsamic vinegar. And the meat came out soooo tender and juicy! This was definately savory!

DEEEEE-LICIOUS - Was Skeptical.  I used a very high grade London Broil (meat in the USA is not graded the same from state to state except for the 11 states that have taken a stand and want meat to be called the same).  What we call London Broil in our area is the tenderloin part of a porterhouse or t-bone steak.)  Therefore, you have to be careful and not marinade it too long since it is already a great piece of meat and tender.  I marinated it for 6 hours (longer than I usually do - normally only l/2 hr. or not at all).  As I said, it was great - I will try this on the tougher meats like flank steak which is outrageous when it is scored and marinated.  Thanks submitter!

This was OK.  It just didn't have the flavor we were expecting.  The steaks did come out very tender though.

Made 1/2 the recipe (as is except for fresh minced onion).  Marinaded 2 porterhouse steaks
for 6 hours and then broiled.  They were perfect -not "too" anything - just very tender and very flavorful!

Delicious, I only added 2 cloves of garlic, because I thought 3 tablespoons was over the top, but otherwise followed the recipe. My 5 yr old said this was the best meat he'd ever had and wanted me to cook it this way all the time!

Fantastic marinade- I used white wine vinegar instead of balsamic (that's all I had).  My family loved it.  Marinated for about 20 hours and had great flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's a keeper!

Incredible!! Marninated rib eye steaks for Christmas Dinner and we were not disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, marinating the steaks for a little over 24 hours. Next time I would only marinate for 12 as they were almost too strong, but a very good flavor. I will use again and again especially on a poorer grade of beef.

I only had time to marinade my steaks for about 3 hours.  I tasted no garlic at all.  It wasn't bad, the steaks still had flavor, just tasted a whole lot like soy sauce.  I will probably try this again marinading for at least 24 hours next time.

This marinade is fantastic.  I always omit the wochestershire sauce and the liquid smoke, and add in more garlic (probably in the neighborhood of 10-15 cloves, minced), and half a bottle of beer.  Everyone that's ever had my ribeyes has raved.  As a bonus, I tried heating the marinade and turning it into a sauce by adding a bit of butter, cornstarch/water, and a can of beef broth and it was great!

I didn't think this recipe was very tasty. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not. The only things I changed were a little less vinegar then called for as suggested and a little less honey as suggested. I really don't think even if I would have put the full amounts in it would have made that much of a difference. I gave it a three star because my 8 yr old son did enjoy his although he dipped his in bbq sauce also. Also I did let it marinade for about 36 hours and that still didn't help. This one is not a keeper. Thank you for posting it anyway I always enjoy trying new things good or bad.

This is the BEST marinade I have ever tasted.  Made exactly as the recipe suggested, I chose to marinate the steaks for 48 hours.  Tender, JUICY with an unbelievable taste.  My eight year old n loved it as did my husband and our dinner guest.  I added the cayenne, and it was not too "spicy".  The ingredients blended well.  I gave it 5 stars for quickness (making the marinade was simple).  However, it does take a bit of time to marinate.  I'm sure it is just as good in less time.

Great marinade! Even my picky five-year-old who almost NEVER eats meat liked it! We added more garlic, and used hickory smoke salt instead of the liquid smoke and regular salt, and used garlic powder instead of onion powder, and they were wonderful! This one's a keeper!

I shortened the marinating time to 6hrs; but no one noticed ;) I used smoke salt instead of liquid smoke, and left out the salt that was called for in the recipe.  Worked out fine.

Out of this world!  I didn't think that I would like the honey in the marinade, so I halved it, but it was fantastic.  I only had six hours to marinade, and it was still tendr and juicy!  Can't wait to use this recipe again!  (Oh!  My three-year-old liked it too!)

This is a delicious marinade, but I tried it with little change that really took the edge off the flavor, and made it a bit more "Thai".  I split the soy with teriyaki, and split the honey with brown sugar.  I think I'll try a bit of ginger, too, next time.  But it's very good!

great for beef shish kabobs (2 days) Also marinated the vegetables separately for 2 days - too strong.. would advocate marinating vegetables for no longer than a day.

The marinate for these steaks gives it a
wonderful flavor. I'm not a big steak eater, but the taste was superb. I would use this recipe again.

Made exactly as directed and marinated for 24hours. Put the steaks on the grill and it smelled so good. However, I took a bite and immediately thought it tasted exactly like beef jerky. We’ve made beef jerky several times but not in a long while. This would be a perfect recipe for that, but definitely not if you are looking forward to a good steak dinner.

My dinner guests asked for my recipe because it was so good.   I proudly forwarded them this link.  That may have been the first time someone asked for a recipe from me.  Success!

Added approximately 2 TBL brown sugar, 1TBL hot sauce, 2 TBLS Creole seasoning. Didn't have liquid smoke.  Was excellent!

My go-to marinade consisted of Lee & Perrins and Balsamic vinegar with a little minced garlic. While this recipe has more ingredients and takes a little more time to prepare, the results are far better. My wife and I agree, this is our new go-to recipe. I used it on a New York strip that was 1 1/2 inches thick and only marinated for an hour. But it was still excellent. I'm looking forward to trying it out on rib eyes marinated over night. Sounds yummy!

purchased 2 very nice ribeyes ($50) marinated from Friday until today (sunday)  This recipe was anything but savory. It was way to sweet.  The balsamic was very potent.  As sweet as it was, it left the steaks with a very  awful lingering aftertaste. I was very disappointed in this recipe and the fact that I ruined 2 beautiful steaks. def not for my family or myself.  most recipes I  try on here are a huge hit.  this was a miss.

I felt that this marinade was too powerful. It didn't compliment the steak at all, in fact, it ruined it. I think this would be great for a bottom of the line cut of meat.  I agree with one reviewer that commented on the sweetness. If you like sweet Asian type marinades then this is for you.

I had only about 7-8 hours marinade time (sealed storage bag, rotated, flipped, etc often) still came out very flavorful and tender.

This was absolutely amazing. I didn't change anything at all except for the cut of meat. We had big sirloin steaks versus ribeye and my-oh-my was this tasty! We let them marinate for almost three days, but my steaks were still mostly frozen for the first day. This is now going to be my go-to method!

We made this using an herb balsamic and truffle olive oil. I only marinated for 30 minutes before pan-searing the steaks. Then, I reduced the remaining marinade and served it as a dipping sauce on the side! It was amazing!

Instead of cooking it right away I let the steak set out to come to room Temperture and then I put the rib eye whole sliced into a gallon  bag I then poured the marinade over the steak. I used red wine,chopped garlic, chopped onions very small chopped. olive oil, soy sauce,Worcestershire sauce and 2 cups beef broth. Let this set in frig. for about 2 hrs. or more it will not hurt the meat if you let it set longer in frig. I then drained liquid and cut up steak in chunks so it would go father. then I added marinate to pan and added steak and chopped Mushrooms and more sliced onions. This was he best chopped steak I have ever had. We put it over egg noodles because we wanted something else beside potatoes or rice. You can also do chicken,pork chops, or other meat. just try this I cut down the salt because all the liquid I used had loys of salt in it.

Absolutely delicious marinade with skirt steak (or flap, flank or butcher steak).  I made extra so I could use the remainder for a chicken, rice and ginger cucumber bowl the following night.  LOVE THIS multi-purpose marinade.

I had to put a rating in before writing a review so I will give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and update the stars depending on the out come. ( I usually only do dry rubs for my steak with maybe a bit of butter) Ok, so I just made this one hour ago and was concerned because I started seeing reviews about it being overpowering or too sour because of the Balsalmic Vingar this was after the steaks had been marinating in this recipe for one hour. I personally hate all vinegars I even hate ketchup because of the vinegar in that. So, needless to say I bought the vinegar just for this recipe I figured the sourness will die down when it is cooked. After reading the reviews I decided to add 1/6 of a cup of brown sugar to the marinade dish and add a little extra olive oil to counteract the effects of the vingar I plan on cooking these in about 12-14 hours from now and I don't have liquid smoke so instead I used Smoked Spanish Paprika my go to substitute for liquid smoke. I used this for 4 ribeyes here's hoping it turns out good. Fingers Crossed.

This was good. I only ended up marinating for for 10 hours or so. Used low sodium soya sauce and added 4 pinches of cayenne pepper..we like more savory flavors opposed to sweet. If I make this again I'd omit the honey.

I doctored the recipe with a whole navel orange, grinded or zested, your choice, milk (helps tenderize) and a lil meat tenderizer. Marinated for a week and a half in freezer, then fridge to thaw. My wife bought me pecan shells. Soaked them for two days and added to fire like chips for flavor.

Made this tonight and it was a huge hit!! My 4 1/2 year old went back for seconds! I followed the recipe exactly with the marinade but cooked it a little differently. I marinated two locally raised grass fed rib eyes, and three small rib steaks for only 3 hours, pan seared it first on the stove in my cast iron skillet on medium high heat with a little bit of olive oil and fresh butter for about 3 mins per side for the rib eyes and a little less time for the rib steaks, then transferred to the grill on low heat for a few more mins to finish cooking while basting with cooked down marinade that I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken. End result was a delicious and juicy steaks that everyone raved about! Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

I only used the marinade because of no grill, but my husband said it was the best steak marinade he's eaten.  Thanks for sharing

I made this marinade with flank steak and chuck steak.  Although I use the cow I purchased from a fellow farmer who has the best flavored beef, the flank and chuck aren't the best cuts.  After I used this marinade, we loved it.  Even our grandchildren couldn't get enough.  I thought I made enough for everyone, but the steaks went fast.  Today I am using the marinade with stew meat for Kabobs on the grill.  Can't wait for supper.  Makes the best tasty tender steak I've had in a long time.  You'll love it!

These were really good.  Very tender.  I made the recipe as directed; however, I had to use garlic powder instead of actual garlic so the balance was a little off.

I've always been hesitant to try steak marinades like this as we're fans of more "traditional" steaks.  However, this exceeded our expectations!  It was fabulous, and I highly recommend.  Can't wait to try this again!

This is a very good marinade but not for expensive cuts of beef.  Best if used on flank steak or london broil.  Tenderizes and flavors tougher cuts of meats.  I would never use rib eyes in a marinade.  I spent  way to much money on them to cover  their natural delicious flavor with a marinade.

I would call this recipe perfectly fine, even very good. Its downfall is that it is no better than many other steak recipes I have tried that require far fewer ingredients. The marinade was a bit too heavy on the soy sauce taste for me, and the garlic was all but absent from the flavor of the dish drowning in all that balsamic vinegar. We did enjoy our dinner very much, but I'm not really sure it was worth all that prep work and ingredient shopping. I served it with sauteed mushrooms, onions, and red bell pepper and some garlic mashed potatoes.

Very good marinade! I used NY strip steak. I only marinated the steak for 12 hours and I did not have liquid smoke. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. The steaks were a little on the sweet side. The kids loved it an had thirds, my husband said it was not his favorite marinade. I definitely will make this again.

The marinate is delicious but I think it would be better on a leaner steak.The rib eye was too fatty for this sauce.I will try this again on either a flat iron or sirloin steak.I also think this would be good with pork or chicken.Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not even a huge steak person but I bought my son a big steak and he found this recipe (he loves to cook!!)  This was by far the best steak I've ever had. I loved the sauce! He added a little ginger and cayenne, the rest was the same. Yum!

Made double the ingredients and used it to sautee mushrooms and onions. This was so good, I cannot imagine if we had marinated the night before. I also cut balsamic vinegar in half and substituted white wine, it went so fast, one of the kids literally stole my plate when I walked away from the table briefly. Served a a warm Italian bread layered with freshly shredded greyure cheese....youll have one happy (and plate stealing family)!

My husband and I didn't care for this marinade.  It was a combo of sweet balsamic / teriyaki sauce.  A strange combo.  Won't be making this again.  A waste of ribeye steaks.

I loved this marinade, but beware, it is VERY strong.  I was only able to find thin cut half lb. ribeyes in my area, and i think next time I'll look for a thicker steak.  I lost some of the meat flavor, but the marinade was delicious.  I did let mine sit for two days, so that may also have played a factor in the strength, but you won't regret trying it.

This recipe is sooo amazing!
I did a couple things different.
 I marinated for only about an hour in a gallon zip lock freezer bag... 
Then I preheated the oven to 400 degrees.
I dumped the marinade and steaks into a 9x13 pan.
Covered with aluminum foil and baked for 45 mins.. 
They were amazing! And so tender you could cut them with a fork :-)

Great flavor - even if I didn't let it marinate for a day. We grilled it out so the smoky flavor worked well with the oriental marinade.  Seems to be a keeper - everyone loved it.

This is a very tasty marinade. I also recommend using this marinade on steak tips and London broils. I don't recommend it for NY strips or rib eye. Use this on steak tips and London broils and you will be very happy.

I only did 1 tsp of pepper and omitted salt, but all else was as written and the steak was really good.  I ate half of it without steak sauce (I am obviously not a high class steak kind of girl :) ).

Amazing Marinade... I used T-Bone Steaks and I only had time to marinade it for about 3-4 hours using a zip lock freezer bag....Flipping bag every so often and rubbing meat each time....I did sprinkle with a hearty pinch of crushed Sea Salt and Fresh Grated Black Pepper only on 1 side while it was placed on grill... Served with Loaded Baked Potatoes, Corn and Hawaiian Dinner Rolls... Served a group of 6 and Everybody Loved it....Father-N-Law said it was a meal for a King ??....Defiantly will be using again

I made this steak as directed, and it turned out delicious. I used rib eye with the bone in because it is a more favorable cut of meat. I bought 2 steaks each weighing 1.32 lbs for 4 adults. There was a little bit left over, but not much. The marinade did not detract from the steak, but added a slightly different dimension to the flavor. I marinated the steaks for 24 hours, and there was no change in meat texture. I usually just grill our steaks with only salt and peppet, but this was a nice change and I would make this recipe again.

Excellent marinade!  We add a tiny bit more smoke and cayenne to give it a stronger flavor.  We've used this half a dozen times this summer as it's easy to make and smells fantastic on the BBQ.

FANTASTIC!  Made it for steak. This was my contribution to a communal dinner with certified Foody Friends!  Got raves. Per other reviews, did reduce the soy and vinegar by about a fourth. I think it was a good decision. Could definitely marinate more than 24 hours. Might do 48 next time. I used the diced garlic from a jar because you need so much. I will make this again for sure.

Family loves this recipe.  This is the second time I have done this recipe.  First was on a Sirloin tip roast and this time on just over 3 lbs of Sirloin Tip Steaks.  Allowed the steaks to marinate for several hours before BBQ.  The meat was tender and full of great flavours.   Will be doing again.  Thank you Angie for sharing this recipe.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written, with very good cuts of meat (rib-eyes). I marinated for 24 hours. While the whole family thought that it was okay, they didn't want me to make it again. Everyone thought that the balsamic vinegar flavor was too strong, and the vinegar, combined with the soy, overwhelmed the flavor of the beef.

Ok- I am not a steak person- I usually prefer skirt or hanger steaks so I used this marinade just as it was written on 2 skirt steaks- I let my grill get blazing hot- I mean 700 degrees hot then seared them only about 2 minutes per side they were nice and charred on the outside still medium on the inside.... 

I died and went to heaven when I ate this. I am not kidding the steaks with this marinade were the most delicious amazing bite of food I've ever put in my mouth in my life- and I am a foodie. Sweet, succulent, tender- I can't. This is just amazing you have to try it.

Wonderfully different. You can use this on cheaper cuts of steak and it turns out tender and flavorful. You can also use a little less balsamic vinegar.

I fixed this marinade and let my steaks sit for 24 hours, I did add a teaspoon of meat tenderizor as the steaks were very lean. I fixed this for company and every one enjoyed the nice extra beefy taste it added to
very tender center cut Rib Eye steaks. Definately the one I'll go to for all my beef recipes.

Pretty tasty.  My people like the honey so I used more like a little over  quarter cup, warmed up so it blended nicely.  I think it worked real good, if you like it a little sweeter.  This recipe covered 4 nice size NY steaks.  Also I only marinated for about 1.5 hours.  I can see how several hours might be very good.  Bbq'd  it rare and med rare over lump charcoal.  My 3 stars..tasty but not outrageous.

The only thing I changed on the recipe was that I used agave nectar rather than honey.  I had 4 good sized rib-eyes so I doubled the recipe and marinated the steaks in a 9x13 glass baking pan.  I cooked the 2 of the steaks the same day after marinating them for about 8 hours and they were really good.  I decided to cook the other 2 the next evening (steak 2 nights in a row... yay!); after marinating for over 30 hours let me just say that those steaks were even MORE delicious than the ones from the night before!  Great recipe!

Delicious.  Marinated 1/4-1/2" thick ribeye steaks overnight, turning over in the morning.  Didn't baste at all while grilling.  Turned out delicious - even the picky 8 year old ate all of his.

Absolutely loved this! Even though I wasn't able to marinate it for 1-2 days ( I mean who really does this), it was absolutely delicious! Sweet, yet savory at the same time.

This is by far the most amazing marinade I've ever had. I've used it about a dozen times now, and it never fails. My husband frequently requests it and the kids love it, too. I refuse to use anything else now, because other marinades simply can not compare. Delicious!!!

This marinade was so easy to make and delicious, too! I let my ribeyes marinade for two days and after I was done grilling them, they were so tender and delicious! I also like the low salt amount that the recipe calls for.

Wow! By far the BEST steak marinade we've ever made (and rivals many of our favorite restaurants too!). Just before we started cooking the steaks, we took a little of the marinade and got it simmering, then sauteed some onions and sliced mushrooms and topped our steaks with the mix. Delicious! This will definitely make a regular appearance at our house this summer.

I used this recipe for a group of friends and got great compliments. I multiplied the recipe to make enough marinade for 6 Ribeye steaks. I only marinated them for about 3 hours prior to putting them on the BBQ, but it was still very flavorful and best of all, it was easy to make. I will use it again for sure.

I used this marinade on beef sirloin tips and it was very good.  I left out the liquid smoke and was only able to  marinate for a few hours.  Grilled the steak on a gas grill and everyone loved it.  It didn't feel it tasted too strong of vinegar at all.  It was very balanced.

Wow! Never was a fan of marinated steaks but tried this and it was amazing! I thought the vinegar and soy sauce would be over powering of the natural steak taste but it was awesome! Very tender! Given I only marinated about 3 hours but might be better when marinated longer!

No liquid smoke, honey, vinegar, blk pepper or cyenne. Add equal amonts oj. And pineapple juice. (1 C each for these measurments ought to do it) and about (1/4 C brown sugar) Then you will have all the original ingrediants for the "Matt Dillon" a.k.a. the Marshall Dillon rib-eye. This recipe makes the best deer jerky....ever!

Used this on sirloin steaks that I cut into kebabs.  I was only able to marinade for an hour but it was very good.  As others have stated it was tangy, so I wouldn't want to marinade it too long.

Great recipe! My husband and I really loved it, and we are both very picky when it comes to steak. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, or balsamic vinegar. Instead I used regular vinegar and used 1tbsp barbeque sauce and 1tbsp steak sauce.. in addition added 1 tsp dijon mustard. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect. 
Thank you :)

WE liked this marinade, but it didn't knock our socks off or replace our "go to" marinade.  I felt the honey was a bit much, so I'd reduce it if I made this again.  Mr. LTH is not a vinegar fan, yet he didn't complain so the vinegar flavor must not have been too overpowering.  THANKS for the recipe, Angie!

Way too much vinegar in the marinade for my taste.   Marinated for a day and a half, so the vinegar and salt taste (soy sauce) was overwhelming.

Marinated for about 30 hours with this on some great local t-bones. Have to say I will look no further for a great marinate! Thank you for this, it is just subtle enough to not overpower yet adds great taste.

Seems like a lot of work for a marinade but SO worth it. This is my go to recipe now.

I'm not a meat-eater myself, but I cook for several family members that are. To help me figure out what to cook, I'm always looking for recipes that seem to have lots of positive reviews. This one looked interesting so I tried it - and I'm so glad I did! It was so easy to put together and everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe, Angie!

Steaks were wonderful! I made the recipe as instructed except substituted agave instead of honey.  I also only had time to marinate for a little over an hour, but the steaks had a ton of flavor! I can't wait to use this again.

Not sure why this is rated so high. I guess a lot of people like pickled meat. This tasted like vinegar more than anything else.

This recipe is fantastic!!! The only change I made was I didn't put the liquid smoke in and that was because I didn't have any. My family loved it. I will be making this again. Thanks!!!!!!!!

My wife and I both LOVE this marinade! She doesn't eat red meat (99% of the time) but enjoys this recipe. She made this one for me on my birthday one year and since then, we call this one 'Birthday Steaks'. I've cooked it numerous times for my buddies, and they didn't like it as much as i did, i think because of the balsamic flavor. I love the balsamic flavor and the honey works very well too. This marinade works well too with small bits or strips if you want to throw them into a stir-fry.

This is absolutely the best steak marinade I've ever had at home. It tastes like the nicer steakhouses, in my opinion. It just gives a little something to the meat without overpowering its flavor.

I marinated the steak for roughly 8 hours, then cooked the steak in the grill...  even though I over cooked the steak a but the marinade saved it.  My steak was a little tough (completely my fault) but the taste was great. Next time however, I suggest that you leave the recipe as is!  there is no need to change it.

Very yummy! I didn't have onion powder or liquid smoke flavour, but I just left them out and it still tasted great. Honestly though, for only two steaks I really don't see why you need to use a full 1/2 cup balsamic - I halved most of the ingredients and it turned out just fine (maybe because I marinaded in a ziploc bag instead of a dish, so the steaks were completely coated even with way less liquid). I've tried subbing in red wine vinegar for half of the balsamic (cheaper) and that worked too. Overall, a bit hit. This will be our go-to marinade from now on.

This was a good marinade, however I agree with the others that said that it was a little sweet.  If you add salt and pepper after you grill it, it tastes really good!  My husband loved it, but he is a steak and potatoes man.

So good. I used green onion instead of onion powder because that's what I had on hand and used a little less balsamic (probably close to 1/4 cup). The steaks were so tender and made really good sandwiches the next day with goat cheese, mushrooms, and onions on sourdough!

Both hubby and I thought this was great!  I actually halved the marinade as we only had about 3/4 lb of steak total.  Still made a ton.  I heaped on some extra garlic (despite title, didn't find resulting steak particularly 'garlicky'), Worcestershire, liquid smoke and cayenne per our tastes.  Might cut down on the balsamic a little, though I'm glad I made it and set the steaks in the fridge before reading the detractors who found this overly vinegar-y.  We had no such issues (husband not a vinegar person to boot), though it was a touch strong.  Marinated for approx. 6 hrs turning halfway through.

Made these for Father's Day. Even my mom, who isn't a "steak person" devoured hers.  I used fresh garlic but chopped in a blender until paste. I omitted the liquid smoke.

Oh man is this a great recipe.  I tried it the first time as written, and didn't like the overwhelming balsamic vinegar.  So this time, I cut the vinegar in half and it turned out amazing.  Added a dash of chili powder too.  AMAZING!

This was fantastic!  I don't see how anyone could give it a bad review!  I followed it to a T except that I only used 1/4 cup vinegar, only because I had that much left!!  It was perfect.  I marinated them about 12 hours - the flavor was definitely there but not overpowering.  My picky husband gave it a 10.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Angie!

    P.S. @ B.G. Thompson...don't you think since a charcoal grill is the only type of grill you have that you would know how to cook a steak on it without needing directions?!?

This is soooo good!!  I was only able to marinate the steaks for a couple of hours and they were so, so tender.  I omitted the cayenne & used sea salt instead of table salt, but did everything else as the recipe states.  Don't forget to score the meat- that's a big key for tenderness!

This recipe is great! I cooked this over a fire in my back yard, and kept some of the marinade to make gravy for our mashed potatoes. Even my husband ate the gravy and he doesn't generally like gravy! We got a lot of rib steak when we bought our half a cow, so we will eating this again and again over the summer! Thanks!

I didn't have the liquid smoke but it was still great.  It didn't taste like balsamic vinegar or soy... just a very good enhancement to the NY steaks.

i made this according to the recipe and found it MUCH to salty/vinegary for my family's taste.  it seemed like it had good flavor but it was hidden behind the saltiness.  seems like too much soy sauce and too much balsamic.  (i was surprised though, as i am huge fans of both, but did find the combo too overwhelming this time)

This was sooooo vinegary-you could NOT taste the garlic at all! That being said, the flavor wasn't bad, but wasn't great. It was just so vinegary that it gave you heartburn on the first bite! It did not tenderize the t-bones I marinated it in very well either, but maybe that's just the way t-bones are supposed to be?? We ended up cutting the meat off the bones & using it in wraps w/monterey jack, tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, onions, & sour cream. We really liked it that way, hence the 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.

The balsamic vinegar was a little too overpowering to my taste, but the people I served it to didn't complain.  If I made it again, it would be with regular vinegar and only a few tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar.

the marinade seemed to cause the meat to taste soured. Perhaps it was the raw apple cider vinegar I used. I will try a milder vinegar next time.

The marinade was different than I expected, I marinated some bottom round overnight after scoring the meat.  I believe that if you like a more oriental flare and like to cover the flavor of the meat this is for you.  The meat was very tender but the balsamic vinegar seem a little overpowering for me.  Will maybe try again with less balsamic.

Steak wa great! My local market didnt have rib eye steaks on hand, so I used in place new york strips. I used a lower sodium based soy sauce, and marinated the steaks for 1 1/2 days. I cooked them on the grill on med. low for 15 min the first side, and 10 on the other. They turned out wonderful!!!

I left out the liquid smoke and used less balsamic because I am not a big fan of it. I marinated over night and the steaks came out very tender and juicy but the soy sauce flavor was overwhelming. I'm not sure if it was because I didn't use enough balsamic but it was too salty. Other than that it was good. I would make again but with less soy sauce.

very very good. I only marinated it for 10 hrs tho but it still came out nice. Makes alot of sauce so i will probably cut it in half next time. Also i used sirlon steak, a little cheaper, and it was still super good. I also stabed my meat a bunch with a fork and sprinkled meat tenderizor on it before dipping and i fliped then in the middle of my day too. Dont know if those changes matter but i would definately recommend this recipe

I used my meat tenderizer first then added the marinade and tenderized the meat again to drive the marinade in.  It was awesome!  I only had to marinate an hour since I used the tenderizer.  I was a bit scared of all the vinegar so I cut it in half.  The marinade made the steak taste divine!

My boyfriend and I really liked this marinade. I didn't use the liquid smoke, but I followed everything else. I left the steaks marinating for 24 hours or so (which I find was enough). Will be doing this again... super easy, not too many ingredients and delicious!

This is a very good marinade.  Instead of using the cayenne, I subbed 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I also did not use the full 2 tsp of black pepper.  I marinaded a 1 1/2 lb flank steak for about 6 hours, and boy it was tender and flavorful.  I only used half of the marinade and have the other half in the refrig. for later. Thanks so much for the post Angie, I will use this again!

This was very good.  My husband doesn't like balsamic vinegar so I used white wine vinegar.  Marinaded for about 3 hours and cooked on indoor grill.  Update:  We didn't like the leftovers.  After sitting in the fridge for a day, the vinegar taste  was very strong!

This recipe is amazing!  I have made this about ten times and you should definately do it exactly the way the recipe says.  I have made with and without the liquid smoke, but when I barbque I smoke it with wood chips anyways.

Wow is all I can say.  Made this for Father's Day BBQ with extra thick rib-eyes. I marinated for 24 hrs and everyone said they were the best steaks they ever had.  The flavor was to die for and made the juiciest steaks ever.  Will definitely make this over and over!

This marinade is just fantastic.  The steaks were tender and very flavourful. After I was done with it, I added it to my "soup cup" in the deep freeze, and my husband just made the best soup I ever had with that (and one other soup cup of assorted leftover stuff).

This steak was ok.  I found the balsamic vinegar to be a bit to harsh and overpowering. Next time I will only use half the amount.  I did enjoy how the steak stayed very moist and did not dry out.

Yum!  This was really good.  We only had about an hour to marinate the 2 NY strip steaks that we had but they still turned out delicious.  Broiled them for about 10 minutes.  I will definitely use this recipe the next time I marinate steak!

I made the marinade exactly as written, and marinated a 1.5 lb top sirloin for about 3 hrs.    I then broiled it (I don't remember how long.)  The meat was very tender, but the balsamic flavor was overwhelming (and I'm a big fan of balsamic.)  If I were to make it again, would definitely halve (at least) the vinegar.

Making this AGAIN for dinner, and realized I haven't reviewed! I throw everything in a ziploc, marinade my steaks overnight, and usually broil. The only changes I make are to add extra garlic--1tsp powder, and leave out the liquid smoke (DH used to be a restaurant cook and hates the stuff). Such an easy way to spruce up steaks!

Great marinade!  I used 2 bacon wrapped filets and was only able to marinate for about 6-7 hours.  I had some shrimp that needed to be used up so I threw them in the marinade as well.  Yum!  The flavors worked very well together.  I cooked this in the skillet and the meat turned out so tender.  Can't wait to try this out on the grill once the weather gets  warmer!

These were amazing!  I poked the meat and then rubbed the marinade in and let them sit for about 1 1/2 days.  Excellent flavor!  Highly recommended.

By far the best marinade I've ever had. I made two 1 lb steaks (doubled the recipe) and my fiance and I both ate the whole steaks (along with the mashed potatoes with fried onions and mushrooms from this site - awesome!)

I rate my dishes not just by my own taste but by the reactions of those I cook for.  I made four servings (2 1-inch rib eyes about 0.8 lb each) last night so that my boyfriend and I would have leftovers for lunch.  As we ate, I saw him eyeing my plate.  As soon as he finished his, he reached over, grabbed the half I left for lunch, and finished that too.  Lunch, dinner gone.  How I prepared it: marinated overnight, no cayenne or liquid smoke, broiled for 5 minutes each side for medium.  A definite keeper - the steak and the bf!  :)

Very flavorful and tender.  There was something about this recipe that was really great.  I think it was the balsamic vinegar.  However, there was another flavor or two that I didn't care for as much.  But this recipe is good and I'll definitely cook it again ... although I will probably play around with it some.

This marinade is phenomenal! I would give it 10 stars, if I could. I followed the recipe exactly. I have marinated my steaks for as little as a couple hours to overnight. The outcome is always so flavorful and tender.

This marinade was absolutely amazing! Although I did not have the time to marinate my steaks overnight (only managed to marinate for 4 hours) once I barbequed them on my grill they tasted like heaven. The only thing I changed is the amount of crushed garlic (I used only 1 tablespoon).Will definitely do it again!

Delicious! The steaks were packed with flavor and with every bite an explosion of flavor occured, from the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar, to the saltiness of the soy sauce! The meat was a bit tough, I am not sure whether it was due to the cut or the marinade. Will try a different cut next time. I grilled 6 steaks for 3 people and had no leftovers! A major hit :)

Wow! This marinade is fabulous. Both my husband and I love bold flavors and this definatly was bold! I used really cheap steaks because of the strong marinade and it made them absolutely wonderful! I put the steaks atop a pile of grilled potatoes and it was a really nice little meal!

I only used about 1/8 cup soy sauce and 1/8 cup of vinegar for my marinade, I don't like a strong soy sauce taste.  My steaks were tender and very flavorful.  This is a great recipe, thanks!

This is our favorite steak marinade.  I never seem to have liquid smoke, so I just make the marinade without it.

i followed this recipe exactly. I thought it had too much basalmic vinegar taste. it wasn't bad but I guess I don't really like the vinegar taste on my steak.

Loved it!  I only had time to marinate it for 8 hours but it still tasted great.  My husband didn't even need to use A1 sauce, which is very unusual, even in restaurants.

I really wanted to love this recipe.I do enjoy the notes of balsamic vinegar. However, for as many ingredients as this marinade calls for, I expected the flavor to be out of this world.  I've made it twice now (as written), and came to the same conclusion each time - it was just okay.

This recipe is fantastic, din't change a thing except used T bones.  I also broiled with rack in center of oven 12 minutes first side 6 minutes other side for medium well. Steaks were about 1 inch thick.  Only marinated for 2 hours.

Wonderful flavors. The garlic is not overpowering. Slight crunch on the outside while moist on the inside.  Highly recommend this recipe for any griller!

This is good, the marinate smells so yummy but the taste is a little disappointing. I was expecting a better flavor. The steak is very tender though and I marinated it for 24h.

My boyfriend gave it 3 stars but i give it 5 so i averaged the 2. I LOVED the flavor and I marinated it for an hour on the counter in an air tight container and it was plenty of time to bring out the flavor. The boy doesn't eat steak with marinade which is why he gave it such a low rating. I didn't have the vinegar or enough garlic...i added some garlic powder as i only had about 1 tbsp of minced and added a tsp of powder. Delicious! Will definately use again(for myself at least :p)

Very good flavour! I tried this with moose steaks, marinated only 4 hours but had great results. Will try a longer marinade next time. We really liked the pepper/honey combo.  Update---this is a really good marinade for less tender steaks, and for any kind of game meat. I've now used it on venison as well, and the longer it sits, the more tender it gets. Have to say, I would never use it on a AAA Angus rib eye, that's just ridiculous unless you don't actually like steak.

This has become a staple in our home! Recipe makes enough to coat about 4 steaks, and has a bite to it! I make it exactly as written, with no changes, and it makes any steak tender and delicious!

Fantastic marinade!  If you love steak you'll love it even more with this marinade.  I eliminated the liquid smoke & cayenne pepper because I didn't have any - but didn't miss it.

This marinade was good and all the flavors worked well for me.  Still, with all those ingredients, I felt it should have been amazing, and it wasn't.  Russian dressing and Montreal steak seasoning is still the best marinade for steak in my book, and much easier to make.

This recipe is awesome!! The smell is strong but believe me its good. I promise, you wont be disappointed. I have yet to try this marinade with rib eye (its marinading overnight), but I did try it with skirt steak. The measurments are too much for 2 steaks...its more for 4. But other than that your good. enjoy.

Really good marinade!  I especially like the sweetness from the honey.  They do have a tendency to burn, so watch closely.  Mine needed about 5 minutes on each side for medium well.

Although this marinade has a good taste, it is very low-key and not quite bold enough for us. My husband and I were both breaking out the steak sauce for these.

I loved the flavor of this marinade!  It was kind of sweet and the garlic was nice.  It was a nice change from the dry rub I normally use for steaks.

It was very good although it may be more appropriate to use this marinade with a lower quality piece of meat.

Made this marinade exactly as written but I was only able to marinate for 8 hours instead of overnight and the flavor was still great!! I think I might cut the amonut of honey in half the next time, i'm not a big fan of sweeter marinades. This marinade will be replacing my old. Thanks!!

Yum, I finally found a tasty marinade for my steaks! I used this on rib eye and porterhouse steaks and it was great. I did use apple cider vinegar bc it was all I had but I cut the amount I used in half and like others, added a bit more honey. Tastes great and very simple!

Very good marinade.  I used two large rib eye steaks and marinated for 24 hours.  Next time I will let it go for 48 hours.  Also, I saved the marinade, and cooked it down with some wine, and it was an EXCELLENT sauce.

These were great.  I did not have Rib-eye so I used what I had.  They reminded me of peppered beef jerkey and we love those.

I thought this was amazing! I used it to marinade some steak pieces for shishkebobs and it was perfect. I left out the extra salt and didn't have any liquid smoke, but it was perfect. I will definitely make this again. A lot!

This recipe is great just the way its written. I didn't have any liquid smoke but think it would make it even a little better. We did 2, large sirloin steaks & still had plenty of marinade. Other reviews are right, its restaurant quality.

WOW!!! Just like the descriptions says, tender, juicy and melt in your mount. All I did was use bigger steaks, I went to the butcher and asked him to cut 1.5" slabs of Rib-eye. Doubled the recipe and marinated over 24 hours. Served with twice baked potatoe and bacon, garlic green beans. AMAZING!

Very good, very tasty.  We only had time to marinate it for a half hour or so, and then basted it with the leftover marinade while grilling- but I can imagine it will be much tastier after marinating overnight.

My friend said the marinade made the steaks taste like Korean BBQ.  The balsalmic vinegar gives the steaks a sharp taste (even when I used less vinegar than the recipe called for).  I used tri-tip steaks (really nice and tender), and broiled them in tin foil to lock in the moisture.  Overall, good recipe.  =)

this is very good. i didnt have balsamic vinegar, so i used burgundy wine instead. i didnt have much time to soak the steaks, but in 2 hours i could taste how good it would be if it soaked for a day or 2. will definately try again and follow the recipe exact.
update... i made it exact this time and soaked for 2 days. not as impressed. i think i prefer the burgundy wine to the vinegar. maybe 2 days is too long. not sure. i like the flavor of steak, i think this over powered it.

My husband and I both thought these were delicious.  I took the advice of other reviewers by reducing the amount of balsamic vinegar and omitting liquid smoke.  Our steaks had great flavor and juiciness.  Thanks, submitter.

Sorry, but this didn't do anything for me.  The vinegar flavor was way too overwhelming.  Perhaps, with a decrease in the amount of vinegar, I'd try it again.

This was great! I used it with flank steaks, that i marinated for 1-2 hours.  I use half of the recipe for the marinade and then the other half for sald dressing.  i cook the flank steak then slice it up and serve it over salad. i used the recipe as is except I changed the onions to shallots bc I like their taste better... and I never have liquid smoke on hand, so I always leave that out.

As my Husband said THIS IS SO JUICY AND FULL OF FLAVOR. We were both impressed. We had these for Valentines dinner and I was sure satisfied. I did use fresh garlic and onion. Oh and I dident use as much vinegar as suggested and it was just perfect. The time was way off we had to grill each side for 20 min. and make sure you seir each side first to keep the juice in the steak so it can be nice and tender. This went great with garlic red potatoes from this site. And if you havent tried the choclate covered strawberrys it was a great combination for Valentines Day.

This recipe is outstanding!  You don't have to let it marinate for the whole day because it may be too strong for some people.  My wife likes it marinated for just a couple hours.  Amazing taste, definitely a dish to entertain with.

Made this for a first date once and I swear, I thought the guy was going to set up camp at my house! Needless to say, he was impressed.  Both he and I always put A-1 on our steaks.  Not this one!!  Great marinade!!

Great marinade.  I omitted the smoke flavoring and substituted orange marmalade for the honey as that is what I had on hand.  My steaks came out succulent and delicious.

A big thanks to you Angie! I prepared the marinade exactly as listed, and the flavor of these steaks turned out very delicious, juicy and tender. I have been searching for a great tasting marinade for a long time, and finally found it. My picky wife and son also ate every bite, and my son said "this is the best steak I have ever tasted".

Next time I would scale back the basalmic vinegar. We could barely taste the garlic.

This was a very good steak marinade.  The flavor was very intense.  I almost wondered if it was too much, but my husband loved it.  The steak was very tender and juicy.

Used this marinade for a london broil and hubby and daughter loved it. I don't eat steak but it smelled great while cooking. I added much more liquid smoke than stated because my whole family loves the flavor. Thanks Angie!

This is an amazing marinade...I will never look for another steak marinade!  Thanks for sharing! I didn't have enough balsamic vinegar on hand to follow the recipe exactly, so only used 3 Tablespoons balsamic and 3 Tablespoons white vinegar.  It was perfect.  I used it on tri-tip and marinated it overnight.  There were no left-overs and I'm marinating some right now for tomorrow!

FANTASTIC!  I used 4 NY Strip steaks and marinated them for 2 days (flipped them in marinade after 1 day).  They were incredible and very tender.  The marinade has a different taste so it's a great change from the generic bbq sauce.

I like this marinade -- nice blend of sweet and savory.  I increased the cayenne level by waaay more than a pinch and nixed the addition of salt (soy has plenty of sodium).  Marinated a flank steak overnight, then grilled to med-rare... perfectly tender.  Thanks!

I cut the wine vinegar in half and used mild red wine vinegar, but we still felt like the wine vinegar overwhelmed the other flavors.

this marinade turns out great everytime. it's a staple now. i almost always have all the ingredients for it and it works on veggies and other stuff too. it's great to throw together at the end but even better when you can let the meat marinate for a few hours.

This marinade is excellent.  We went by the book and used rib-eyes, although we don't prefer them.  Next time we will use strip steaks.  Great flavor!

I didn't have the cayenne pepper or the liquid smoke flavour and I only had half the soy sauce required (I substituted with half soy and half teriyaki).  Even with all the alterations it was still wonderful and the steak was just perfect.  We love garlic and balsamic so this one's going to be a family fave of ours for a while yet!

I used the recipe as is; I did use rib eyes & I did marinade these for a full day, which in my opinion is too long. As one reviewer cautioned, the marinade completely overpowered the taste of the beef. These were very good but I don't know if I like them better than w/ a sprinkling of olive oil or butter, garlic, salt & pepper ... I really like the taste of steaks & want the flavor of the beef to come through.

Use this marinade on a tenderloin cut and it is melt in your mouth good - absolutely delicious. I can't wait to use it on the BBQ now that summer is here. Add extra garlic and you can't go wrong - just make sure to have some breath mints on hand!!!

The flavor was good but I thought the liquid smoke was a bit overpowering.  Don't do what I did and substitute NY steak, that's just what I had on hand, the texture came out something like shark.  Overall it was tasty and the bad part was probably my fault.  There is no substitute for Rib Eye!!!

With so many good reviews, I was really disappointed.  The balsamic vinegar flavor was overwhelming.  It was also too sweet.  (I marinated overnight) If you like steak to taste like steak, try another marinade.

This recipe was WICKED GOOD!!  I didn't get a chance to marinate it for a two days or even a whole day and it was still very flavorful.  I think it was one of the best steaks I have ever had even compared to restaurants. I highly recommend this.

Excellent marinade for any cut of beef :D
I used this for petite sirloin steaks and they came out perfectly.  I marinaded them overnight and the flavor was wonderful but not over powering.

Did not turn out tender as other comments.  I left out liquid smoke flavoring as I did not have it.  I also marinated for  8hrs. Could this be the cause?

I didn't let it soak as long as I should have.  It was quite tasty though. Will let it soak at least 24 hours next time. Ingredients worked well together.

Made our steaks very flavorful and easy to make.  I used shell steaks, instead of rib-eye, which made the amount of marinade too much.  I'll just make sure to halve the marinade recipe for two shell steaks!

Fabulous!!!  This is my new favorite beef marinade!  I made 3 minor changes - half the amount of vinegar, half the amount of pepper, and double the worcestershire.  My family loved this marinade!  I used it on chuck eye steaks and only marinated them for 6 hours.  Terrific, Thank you Angie!

I only had about 4 hours to marinate my steaks, but I surpised how good they turned out with this recipe. The flavors were great. Can't wait to try this one again for the full 1-2 day marinate. My husband loves vinegar and said to keeping using this recipe!  Thanks for making me look so good!

this is a pretty good marinade but both my boyfriend & i thought the dominate flavor came from the balsamic vinegar. i followed this recipe as written with the lone exception of using mesquite liquid smoke. as a cautionary measure i only marinated our t-bone steaks overnight vs. 1 - 2 days. our steaks were outrageously tender but next time will consider cutting back the balsamic vinegar to 1/3 cup. thanks angie!

I put just 1/8 cup of Red Wine Vinegar in place of the Basalmic & did 3 times the amount of Worchester.  I also cut the honey in half.  It turned out GREAT!  I promise you will love this recipe as long as you cut the Vinegar & Honey.

Excellent and easy to make!  I had to double up on honey because it was a bit sour from the basalmic vinegar. Update:  I made this again and my family absolutely loves it.  I didn't have the liquid smoke but it didn't affect the result.   Thank you for sharing your recipe.

addded thanks for a great recipe!!! my husband insisted that I rate this recipe. He said that it was the best "home" steak he had ever eaten.  I omitted the onion salt and liquid smoke because i didn't have any, and marinated for about 1 1/2 hours. Really awesome!

This made extremely Juicy, Extremely tender steaks.  My only note would be this: I marinated for about 24 hours and the steaks had a little too much vinegar/soy flavor.  I may cut the marinade time down to 14 hours next time.  Otherwise, the flavor was absolutely great!  5 star steaks.

Oh my, this was great! I used it to marinate thinly cut flank steak type meat. It was soo good! I even froze some of the meat with the marinade and cooked it a month later, it was still tender and fabulous!

Not bad.  I'd give it 3 1/2 *'s if I could.  A little bland for our tastes, but as I said, it wasn't a bad marinade.  Easy to do, I mixed it in a zip lock bag and just popped the steak in that; it was easy to turn and easy to keep in the fridge without taking up too much space.

Delicious flavor, and the best steak I've ever made (and tastier than many I've had eating out too). Both my husband and I enjoyed it; Unfortunately I could only let it marinate for an hour; and I cooked it in the oven. Wonder how it would have tasted if I fully followed the directions? Oh: I didn't have the liquid smoke or cayenne pepper either.

This would've been better if I had used less balsamic vinegar. Maybe if it was cut down to 1/4 cup.

My family and I loved this marinade.  However, I did use half the balsamic vinegar that was called for in the recipe.  I have used the marinade for ribeyes (marinade 24-30 hours) and for hamburgers (marinade 1 hour).  Both turned out fantastic.

Personally, I didn't like this at all.  I let the steaks marinate 12 hours, and they seemed way too pungent.  The honey taste threw the whole thing off for me.  However, all the guys that ate the steaks loved it! I might try this again, marinating them a shorter time and cut down the honey, if not eliminate it all together.

This was very tasty, although after reading all of the reviews I guess I was somewhat let down..I was expecting out of this world steak. I marinated top sirloin 1 1/2 days.  My husband and I both thought it had a mild teriyaki beef jerky taste to it. Next time I will probably use this in a pepper steak stir fry.  I also halved the vinegar and honey as suggested by others and added a few dashes of monterey steak seasoning instead of all the pepper.

This was okay.  The final result tasted like a steak dipped in steak sauce.  I ended up having to marinate it for 1 1/2 days.  Maybe that was too long.

We left out the balsamic vinegar, used garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and only let the steaks marinate for an hour and they still turned out fantastic!

Good steaks. We used rib eyes for these, and decreased the balsamic as suggested. I personally wouldn't have minded more vinegar, but I like tangy/vinegary tastes. My husband doesn't like that kind of taste as much, though, and probably wouldn't have liked this if it had any more vinegar than I used (I think I halved what the recipe called for). Delicious. We did leave out the liquid smoke since we didn't have any

I cut the vinegar in half as others have suggested. I added a few shakes of sesame oil as one reviewer did. And it is absolutely fabulous!! I would cut down the pepper a bit next time. Also I did not add the smoke or cayanne because I didn't have them on hand! I can't wait to try marinating mushrooms in some of this for a couple minutes before wrapping in foil and grilling.  Absolutely the best recipe I have ever found anywhere! If I could give it 50 stars I would!

Ok, I want to start out by saying this is dang good. I halved the vinegar and honey like everyone said to do and it was perfect. I have issues with all the negative comments of this marinade because it could have been the cut of steak they used it on that made it not as good. It's not like chicken that tastes the same every time. Different steaks have different flavors. Anyway, try it because it's sooooo yummy!

Well, my husband really loved it but I thought it had too much vinegar which overpowered the steak. I will admit that the meat was tender and juicy but the grill was hard to clean because the juice carmalized on the rack. I guess I'll make it again with a few changes because my husband wouldn't hush up about the marinade.

I will definitely make this again!  I used t-bones and since I did not have any powdered onion, I used fresh onion and marinated for two days.  I charred the first side, probably because of the honey, but then turned the flame to low and finished.  These were wonderful.  Served with tiny potatoes and fresh green beans.  We ate until we couldn't eat any more!  Leftovers will make great sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe Angie!

I would give this 5 stars, but my husband wasn't quite as thrilled with it as I was.  I'll definitely make it again, but maybe use a bit less honey (the outside of the steaks were somewhat charred because of the sugar).

Absolutely FANTASTIC!  My fiance has not stopped raving about this recipe!!   The first time I omitted the liquid smoke (didn't have it on hand) but used it the second time.  He didn't notice much difference, but I preferred it without.   We tried it with filets and it was WONDERFUL!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Unless you like a vinegar taste on your steak ... I didn't care for it.  My husband on the other hand though it was ok hence the 3 stars.

A bit too sweet for our tastes...I used a good balsamic vinegar and a good organic honey... it had a good flavor though...might make again...kids (2-1/2 and 1) LOVED it though... they split a T-bone steak between the two of them......

This is really tender, just like what everyone's been saying! I used porterhouse twice, so far the best type to use, omitted the liquid smoke, used minced onion and squeeze all the onion juice out of it, added quite a bit more worcestershire sauce and cut down the soy sauce like suggested by many others, and it turned out great both times! Will continue to use this recipe! Thanks Angie! :)

While good, the steak turned out a bit too sour; and this is from a person who enjoys vinegar a great deal.  I'll cut back on the vinegar next time, but otherwise very good.

I tried this recipe (minus the cayenne & liquid smoke) and used sirloin steaks.  The meat became very dense and tough during the marinating process and came out very chewy after broiling.  The flavor was okay, but it did not make it juicy and tender like others have claimed.  Did I do something wrong? I might try it again some other time with the ribeye.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe.  I used it to marinade a top round steak.  The meat turns out very very tender.  My suggestion is to leave for AT LEAST one day.  If it goes longer even better!

I loved these steaks.  I will always marinate mine with this recipe in the future.  My husband liked them too, but he always prefers salt, pepper, and A1 sauce.  I didn't use any liquid smoke, and I only marinated mine for 24 hours.  I will use this again.  They tasted so good and were so juicy.  I used Ribeye, of course.

Fabulous marinade!  I used it on a top side steak but next time I am splurging on a sirlon or rib eye. Only marinated it for about 6 hours but the flavour was great. Will be using again for sure.

I was very excited about trying this but wow what a disappointment . I was convinced we had left something out but we didnt . In a word "yuck"!
Save your time and steaks and pass this one by.

WOW! This was amazing! We used T-Bone steaks because they were on sale, and I only marinated 6 hours instead of overnight. I can only imagine if I'd have marinated 1-2 days, how fabulous that would have been! Super tasty! Absolutely LOVED it!!!

This was absolutely wonderful!! My husband said this was by far the best steak he has ever had. He just couldn't get enough of it! I used porterhouse steaks and doubled the recipe. I left them for about 24 hours, flipping them after 12. We'll definitely be using this one again!

This was delicious. I used chuck steak and marinaded it for 4 days, but it was a bit tough still. That, however, is my fault for cheaping out. I will make this again with a more tender piece of meat.

I was short on time and didn't marinate the meat as long as it called for but it was still quite good.  I think it would have been alot better marinated for at least 24 hours.

I used bottom round steak for this (this is one of the cheapest steaks, on sale at $1.64 a pound), and it turned out pretty tender. Don't waste your money on expensive steak. Followed the recipe exactly, used 4 steaks. There is a strong vinegar taste to it, if you're not into vinegar. And as for the smoky flavoring, I used it, but it's not essential, don't waste your money on that either. Be prepared cause you will end up smelling like garlic (12 cloves total). Even though I used it for basting too, there was a lot of sauce left over. I would say this recipe is good enough for 10 steaks, if you put it in a tightly closed container. 12 hours is long enough. Most of the time I find no reason to marinate steaks. Course salt (the brazilian style of barbecue) is enough, I make shih-kabobs, and thick juicy steaks without needing to marinade the meat. The meat already has its own special taste for me.

I think this is the best steak marinade I have found! The only changes I made were using red wine vinegar instead of balsamic (that's all I had) and I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy (once again, all I had!) But it still turned out amazing! Restaurant quality for sure!

Absolutely the best marinade I've ever tasted.  We had only a few hours to marinade our steaks, but the flavor and texture still turned out superbly.  I can't recommend this highly enough!

This essentially a Korean BBQ marinade. I only realized this after I tasted my steak...I'm Korean-American and don't cook Korean food much. I checked with my mom and sure enough the ingredients match.  It was yummy but I give it 4 stars only because it's such a familiar taste for me.  If you like this flavor, you should try your local Korean restarant.

This was a very succulent dish!  I love garlic and it had just enough.  The steaks were so tender I could cut it with my fork.  It's best to let it marinate overnight.

Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!  I usually don't make steak because I've found that it doesn't turn out so well.  I decided however, to try this recipe and it was fantastic. It had the right amount of seasoning. I'm a steak lover once again.

This was an excellent marinade.  I did not have the liquid smoke, used NY strip steaks, and marinated for only 8 hours.  The taste was flavorful throughout the meat.  Can't wait to try again after I purchase liquid smoke.  I'll try marinating longer too.  Enjoyed by the entire family.

Great marinade!  I would suggest a shorter time for marinating because the mixture is so potent.  I had marinated the steaks for 10 hours and they seemed a little too infused with the mixture.  My boyfriend said it was the best steak that he's had in quite awhile, and we go out to eat!

The steak was very flavorful but it was not as tender as the reviews said it would be.I may have chosen the wrong steaks (rib eye).My husband loved it though he said that it tasted like beef jerky.I will make it again just with a different steak. Thanx!

This is a great recipe. I let meat marinade for 48 hours, served to dinner guests and they LOVED it! Will make this again and again!

This was fantastic!  Let a couple of KC strips marinate for about 30 hours and both DH and me loved them!

Used fresh chopped onion and brown sugar instead of honey, and omitted the liquid smoke.  Was a fantastic marinade nonetheless, made us all wish we had twice as much steak!

This is the best marinade I've ever tried for steaks! We made T-bones for Christmas dinner and they just melted in our mouths. Flavor was just right; not too overpowering and they sure were juicy. It's a keeper in our household! Will use again and again! Thanks for the recipe.

My family enjoyed this.  I was looking for something to do with some steaks and came across this recipe, I didn't have time to do the all day marinade, maybe 30 minutes.  I pierced the meat with a fork to let the juices get in and rubbed it. It was terrific.

This marinade is delicious.  I used a little less garlic for our taste.  We served it to guests and they raved about their steaks.  We will use this often. Thank you for a great recipe!

This marinade was okay.  Something tasted a little overpowering, possibl the balsamic vinegar.  Not sure if I'll make again, have definitely had better.

Tasty. Tastes like teriyaki. Next time will definitely marinate for 48 hours; did 24 hours with a London Broil; would have been even better if I had marinated it longer. Only used half the honey suggested; still sweet enough. I think the amount the recipe calls for would have been too much.

This was a great marinade! I added rosemary, thyme, marjoram and red pepper flakes. I also used this on pork tenderloin, it was really good. I thought the spices added a great flavor to the mix of liquids.

I tried this out at our Memorial Day cook out.  It was very yummy--the steaks were very tender and flavorful.  Everyone raved at how good they were.  I will definitely use this again.  I am going to try a modification on it and replace the soy with teriaki sauce, and add 1/2 cup of orange/pineapple juice to use on chicken...

This is really delicious, quick (if you don't count marination time) and easy!  I don't give it a great kid rating just because I have found most kids are not crazy about marinated steak...grill them a hot dog instead ;o)

Excellent recipe!  I've discovered that this marinade also works wonders on budget cuts (flank or skirt steak).  Marinade overnight and grill or broil whole, then slice on the diagonal and serve (great in a wrap, too).  Very tender and flavorful!

This marinade made the steaks taste so good I gnawed the bone.  The marinade would also be a good one for chuck roats I think.

This recipe was outstanding! I used my
foodsaver (vacuum seal machine) to do
the marinating. My memorial day guests
loved it. They think I'm such a genius.

I marinated my steaks for 24 hours, and did not really get the flavor that one would expect from all these ingrediants.
