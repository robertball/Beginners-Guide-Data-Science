I made a few substitutions because I didn't have the ingredients listed.  Instead of soft tofu I used firm and I didn't have Szechuan peppercorns, so I used Chinese five spice instead.  The flavour was not bad, but there was almost no sauce at all.  Totally unlike the ma po tofu I used to get in Vancouver (though I knew the tofu texture would be different).  With a bit more sauce this would be closer to a 4 star (and next time I'll add no salt as it was quite salty as is).
