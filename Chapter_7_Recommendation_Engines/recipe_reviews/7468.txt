Excellent- I took another reviewer's suggestion to use 3 cups of rhubarb - next time I'm using at least 4 cups. I definitely will be making this again, I'm also going to use the basic recipe too for other different fruits such as blueberries, cherries, peaches - it can be endless.

This cake is outstanding!  Other than adding an extra cup of chopped rhubarb, I followed the directions exactly and the cake turned out beautifully ... I'm going to make another one this weekend to share with family.  You won't be disappointed in this one!

Good old fashioned comfort food dessert. Moist and delicious with a pretty, pebbly top.  Mine was done at 38 minutes!

This recipe is wonderful and delicious.  I know that it already has lots of reviews, but thought I would send mine, too.  I did read through the other reviews and increased the rhubarb to 4 cups, reduced the sugar in the cake to 1 cup, and added oatmeal (1/3 cup) and a little more flour to the topping.  Enjoy!

Very dense and moist cake.  We loved it and will definitely make it again.  I put the rhubarb through my food processer to chop it pretty fine and then drained some, but not all of the juice.  I used 2 cups of the finely chopped rhubard and it was perfect.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I used the rhubarb juice to add to the milk instead of lemon juice - probably between 1/4 and 1/2 cup of juice.  I also didn't add the topping suggested as I didn't want a coffee cake.  I used homemade cream cheese frosting and it was wonderful!

What an interesting cake this made.  I doubled the rhubarb and otherwise followed the recipe closely.  That was a few days ago.  The cake turned out VERY moist to the point of almost having a custard-like texture.  It was thoroughly cooked and took longer than stated in the recipe.  I refridgerated it and it just got better and better each day since!  It is a delicious, heavy, moist coffee-cake.  It would probably be lighter and less moist without doubling the rhubarb but I will be making it again the same way as we really liked it.

This is very similar to a family favorite my mom has been making for years!  She uses brown sugar instead of white in the batter and we only top it by sprinkling with cinnamon & nutmeg.  My father in law can eat the whole thing by himself!

This recipe is great! Moist and a little bit tart.  I added 1/4 cup of oatmeal to the topping...that worked well. Definitely a keeper!

For some reason, the topping went to the bottom of the pan when it baked, but it came out very good anyway.  It could have maybe used another cup of rhubarb.  My family really liked this cake, and it DID taste even better the next day!

This is delicious but very sweet, so next time I'd cut back a little on the sugar.  I made this in my bundt pan and cooked it about 15 minutes longer than the original recipe.  I don't think I'd make it in that type of pan again, only because the cake is so moist that chunks came off the top when I tried to remove it from the pan onto a cooling plate.  Didn't look very pretty, then... but still tasted great!  Nice recipe for fresh rhubarb!

I doubled the rhubarb because it's the season and we can't get enough. Great cake recipe for any fresh fruit. In addition the cinnamon, I added a sprinkle of ground cardamom to the cake and to the topping.

The first time I made this cake was 10 yrs ago, and being the type of cook I am, the spills wore out the writing, I'm so happy I found the exact recipe...it rocks!  If KMBJAR had problems with it, maybe the oven should be checked...was it turned on?  to 350?

This is a very nice basic recipe.  You can alter it to suit your taste (eg. more/less rhubarb, more/less spice, more/less sugar), but in the end it is a good cake.  I found that mixing the batter in my standing mixer was excellent for producing a light batter for a fluffy cake.  Thanks for a great recipe=:)

Sorry to be the only dissenter but this cake didn't work for me.  I followed the recipe exactly and got a big soupy mess.  I even made the cake a second time because I thought I'd made a mistake.  What a waste of good and hard-to-find rhubarb...

This was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. I made it as is, except put one teaspoon cinnamon in the batter and one teaspoon in the topping (instead of all of it in the topping). I was planning on taking it to work but a third of it disappeared over night. It is nice and moist, very delicious.

A cake so delicious I made it twice in one day. The second time around I cut the sugar back to 1 cup so the rhubarb flavor would come through. Very nice. My son wanted to eat it before dinner was ready. He got one bite. I'm the pushover mom of the year.

I should start this review with a preface, I cannot bake, period.  I am famous (well, infamous) for it.  I attempted this recipe yesterday as I was given a pile of rhubarb and wasn't sure what to do with it all.  This recipe was easy enough for me to try, I did not have buttermilk so I soured some milk per the directions (thanks for that tip) and followed the other directions exactly and this cake turned out beautifully!  It was devoured at a family BBQ, which has never happened for anything else I baked before.  People who claimed not to like rhubarb had seconds!  Thanks for this great recipe, it was perfect and I will be making it again and again.

I love this recipe, although I always make it with at least half whole wheat flour.  (I find that whole wheat flour does well in heavy, fruity cakes.)  Yesterday I switched cranberries (3 cups) for the rhubarb, and brown sugar (a quarter cup less) for the white sugar, and it was delicious too.

Really excellent, almost like a pudding cake when you use 4 c. rhubarb. Be aware the top does not stay crisp by the next day with so much moisture. It is still great and keeps well, however. I did split the cinnamon in the cake and in the topping, and put maybe a bit more in. I may try cutting back the butter just a bit next time, as with the increase of fruit you may not need that either, or sub in applesauce for a bit of the butter. In fact, this cake would be good in fall with apples instead of the rhubarb. Enjoy! Old fashioned flavor in this cake!

Made this cake for an evening barbeque and even though it tasted good, it felt a little more like we should have been eating it at a coffee party. If I were to make it again, I would use 4 cups of rhubarb and add one cup of strawberries to give it more of a fruit taste.  I would also halve the brown sugar crumble on top.

My mother demands it and gets mean if she doesn't get it.

4 stars as written. 5+ stars when increased rhubarb to 4 cups! Amazing! Takes a bit longer to cook with additional rhubarb. Mine took 50 minutes. I also cut sugar in topping down to 1/2 cup and cinnamon down to 1/2 teaspoon (because I wanted to taste rhubarb, not cinnamon). Was delicious!!!

I added the extra rhubarb as others suggested because we like tart flavors. If I had only added the 2 cups I think it would have been too sweet for me. We really liked this recipe & will make it again. I think a few walnuts on top would be yummy too.

Yum~this cake is really good, I used a little less of the brown sugar topping, and added about 1/4 cup of sour cream to the batter...it turned out perfect and will be my official summer cake.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! This is great warm with  real vanilla ice cream! Very moist, just like I have come to expect from recipes that call for buttermilk. It  is by far one of my favorite ingredients because it usually seems to deliver tender moist products. I add 4 cups of rhubarb for enough flavor. I love the sweet/tart combo. Much like a coffee cake.

This didn't come out as moist as I would have liked. I did add another cup of rhubarb as was suggested by several others. I also elected against the crumble top. My mother always used cinnamon sugar instead - so that's what I did and I don't regret it at all.

My neighbor gave me a huge bag of rhubarb.  I was sick and tired of making the same old boring strawberry rhubarb pie, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  It came out so moist and delicious!  The only thing I changed was to use 3 cups of rhubarb, add 1/3 cup of Quaker oats to the topping, and add a tsp of cinnamon to the batter.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

This was DELISH! I also increased the rhubarb to 3 cups, and I'm glad I did. I added 1 tsp Apple Pie Spice to the cake, and used that in the topping instead of plain cinnamon. Next time I might at a little oatmeal and flour to the topping. I didn't would rather it have a crumbly topping then a caramely one.

This cake was pretty bland without much flavor of the rhubarb coming through.  Next time I'd try about 4 cups rhubarb.  I'd use brown sugar, too, to give the cake more flavor and moistness.

I have never tasted rhubarb nor cooked with either it or buttermilk.  Earlier in the week I had purchased some of the buttermilk & on Wednesday saw a market special on rhubarb.  I found this recipe, and made it yesterday.

I can only say I am astonished that I didn't stand there and eat the entire thing.   It was WONDERFUL!   I made it exactly as written ... I didn't chop the rhubarb small enough, but will correct that next time.

I will freeze half the cake today in order to refrain from gluttony.  

Thank you!  patricia bannister

I am adding another rave review for this cake. I also increased rhuburb to 3 cups, and used only 1 cup sugar. Very moist, and almost pudding like texture. I had to bake it ten minutes longer than suggested.

My family loved this most cake, which wasn't too sweet either.  I took the advice of others and increased the rhubarb to 4c, and decreased the sugar  to 1 cup.  I also substituted 1/2 oat bran for 1/2 cup of  flour, in order to add some fiber.  For the topping, I only did half the recipe, but added 1/2 c oatmeal and 1/3 c chopped pecans.  That resulted in a nice streusel-like topping.  Yummy!

This was very good...I did add more rhubarb as some others stated in their reviews.  Although next time I think I will use less of the topping, because I like the tart taste of the rhubarb and all the sugar hides that in this recipe.  I will try 1/2 of the topping next time. (The topping sinks to the bottom and creates an "upside down cake" effect.)  But, it was very yummy...I just ate 2 pieces for breakfast!!!  I like it cold.

Although the topping sank to the bottom while baking making the cake "gooey" (kind of like an upside down cake)..it was still delicious.  I'll definitely make his cake again, but with a little less topping mixture.

Wonderful cake, but don't plan on it being pretty.  It is one of those that gains from being cut and served in individual plates, as the edges of the cake are crumbly and, well, ugly :)

This always comes out super light and really moist (hooray for a foolproof cake recipe!). I'm going to write this one down and keep it on my fridge!

I've also added 1/4c of cocoa and an extra egg to make the whole thing chocolate. It worked beautifully since the recipe is so forgiving. I'm sure it would work well with other fruit and/or nuts.

Great! I added an extra cup of rhubarb as recommended but next time I'll add two extra cups. This recipe calls for waaaay too much sugar!! I only used 1 cup of white, and half a cup of brown and that was still too much! Otherwise wonderful recipe!

Hubby, son and I loved it!  It was very good and easy to make.  Very moist.  I baked it in an 8x8 inch pan because I thought there didn't seem to be enough batter to make a thick enough 9x13.  Of course, the baking time had to be increased.  My husband is not found of cake.  He wants me to make this again this weekend to take to camp!  I am adding it to my recipe box...thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I brought it to a gathering over the weekend and got great reviews.  I might try to add nutmeg to the batter, but I wouldn't change anything else.  I was honored when on of my close friends, who is a great cook, asked me for the recipe!  My kids are asking me to make it again this week!  Thanks!

Very moist and tasty cake. As suggested I used less sugar and more rhubarb. I also substituted the zest of an orange for the vanilla and ginger instead of cinnamon, which worked really well. A definate keeper.

This was so good. I doubled the rhubarb, cut back the white sugar a bit, and added flour and walnuts to the topping, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I've made this cake twice over the past 2 days. The way we liked the cake best was with 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups, lemon zest as recommended by another reviewer, 3 cups of rhubarb. Topping we preferred was very simple: 1/2 cup white sugar with 2-3 teaspoons of cinnamon, mixed together and sprinkled over the top of the batter in the pan. I liked chopped nuts mixed in with the rhubarb too, but my family members who don't like nuts preferred plain rhubarb cake. This is a nice tender cake. It is my preferred recipe now for rhubarb cake.

I used 4 cups of rhubarb as others suggested, but used frozen rhubarb.  When it thawed I drained off most of the excess liquid (as others have stated the cake is very moist after baking).  I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup, the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup oats to the topping.  It wasn't too sweet or too moist after baking.  Mine was cooked through after 35minutes, but I baked for 38minutes so the top was golden brown.  Would definitely make this again!

Took advice of other reviewers and used 3 cups of rhubarb.  Great flavor.  Only rated three-stars because it had more or a bread-pudding consistency than cake-like.

Yum!  I make this every year when my rhubarb comes up.  This year when I made it my mother in law was visiting.  She said, "This may be the best thing I have ever eaten."  After making many times, the only changes I make are to increase rhubarb to 3 to 3-1/2 cups & to add the topping after baking 10-15 minutes.  If you add the topping in the middle of the bake time it stays in the middle or at the top of the cake.  The topping becomes crystallized and has a nice yummy crunch.  My family and I look forward to this every year.

My first time using rhubarb, now I want to grow my own rhubarb!  Anyways, the cake turned out nice and tasted equally well.  The texture reminds me of apple cake.  Maybe next time I'll try it with apples?  I did add a bit more rhubarb to my trial so I think the cake will lighten up more if I used the recommended amount.

Barb, Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this recipe!  This cake is so wonderful, I could easily eat myself into a blissful coma.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.
WOW and WOW again!!!

A patient brought this as a treat to our clinic last week!  Oh my goodness!  I told her I wanted the recipe right away!  I grabbed what little was left in the pan at the end of the day and brought it home to my husband and son and they gobbled it right up and told me to get the recipe, too!  I know that the only thing she changed was adding 4 cups of rhubarb.  It is definately a keeper and I think I might try other fruits (apples, peaches, apricots, plums, blueberries, pears) in the different seasons, too!!

Really yummy cake! I subbed the butter for applesauce (in the cake, not the streusel) and used 3 cups of very finely chopped rhubarb :)

Normally I don't review but this recipe deserved a 5 star review!  It reminds me of a tart fresh apple cake recipe I have used for years.  I did use 4 cups of chopped fresh rhubarb and added a cup of chopped walnuts.  My son was visiting from Canada and both he and my husband  LOVED it!  thank you for the recipe!

Of course I doubled the Rhubarb!  My friend, who "HATES" rhubarb, tried this cake, unknowingly and pronounced it the "BEST cake she had ever had"  I told her it had rhubarb and she literally called me a liar  I think that speaks volumes about how good a cake this is.

EXCELLENT! SO moist. SO flavorful. SO perfect. Ok, well, I do have a "complaint" that these didn't work as muffins (the topping was too heavy so it made caves into the muffins...which I covered up with homemade cream cheese icing, and made them look BEAUTIFUL!)  Several requests for this recipe and for me to make again. Can't wait!

WOW! This was amazing. I had heard of rhubarb but had never had it or even seen it before. My husabnd was asking about it so I tried this recipe and I am so gald I did. The only changes I made was using 3 cups of rhubarb and I used less than half of the topping and it turned out great. I think using all the topping would have been too much sweet for my taste. Great served warm with vanilla ice cream. Thanks!

I followed the directions exactly as written. Mine was done at 38 mins. This was very good and much more moist than I expected. I thought the texture would be more fluffy but it was super dense instead. I would recommend this as a coffee cake more than a dessert cake.

A good cake but I would suggest cutting the topping in half. It's blindingly sweet and really cuts back on the rhubarb flavor.

This is just way to sweet for my tastebuds and my colleagues agreed.  However, with the exception of this being overly sugary it does have a nice taste and it is very moist.  I think I will try using just 1 cup of brown sugar next time (instead of white) and skipping the topping altogether.

YUM-O! as Rachael Ray would say! XLNT! I cut the recipe in half, as I didn't want too much left over after serving guests. I baked in 8" square pan for 25 minutes, your oven may take a bit longer. I used the whole egg, not cutting it in half. No worries! I cut cake into 9 pieces and served 7. Only 1 piece was left over for with a breakfast for 4. Oh yes, I used TWO cups of rhubarb when cutting this recipe in half. Just right!

This recipe converted someone who "hated" rhubarb to someone who asked for the recipe.  I always reduce the sugar to 1 cup in the batter and 1/2 cup in the topping and find the sweetness to be perfect. The first rhubarb of the season always makes me smile because I know this cake will be made immediately!

Another thing I can add to the "do again" list!  This cake is wonderful.  I follwed the recipe exactly, and it came out great. Moist, not too sweet, and the kids LOVED it! I made it this morning, and it's not even dinner time, and it's 3/4 gone already.  I only wish I could grow rhubarb here in GA, because it's so expensive in the grocery stores.  Brought a little bit back from WI last week - and only enough in the freezer for one more cake. Boo hoo!

This was a GREAT cake.  I doubled the amount of rhubarb, but found it was a bit mushy in the middle (my fault).  Next time will make it with only 3 cups.  I found like another reviewer said, some of the brown sugar topping sunk to the bottom, but we liked it anyway...kind of a suprise at the bottom.  Excellent recipe and was even better the next day!  Thanks! Update: July 1, 2009...Made this again for Canada Day and it turned out perfectly.  Used 3 cups of rhubarb and baked a little longer than recipe calls for...perfect and golden brown.  My Dad and Mom loved it!  Thanks again!

I only had 2 cups of rhubarb so I couldn't put more in like others suggested and mine was not fully mature so it wasn't that tart so I also only used a cup of sugar like others suggested. I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour and I added 1 teas of cinnamon like others suggested. Also I added to the topping 1/4 cup ground Flaxseed (b/c I try to hide that in anything I can so my kids get some good things in them) and 1/2 cup oatmeal and the topping was the best part of the cake. It was defiantly a nice sweet crunch that went well w/ the moist cake. The cake tasted wonderful and everyone loved it but you didn't taste the rhubarb as much as we all would of liked. My dad eats rhubarb raw and he defiantly wanted more of a rhubarb taste... it was more like a spice cake. And as soon as I tasted the cake I knew I've made this cake before using chopped Granny Smith apples. It's one of my favorite fall desserts so you can definatly add different fruit... the tarter the better!  Next time I'm definatly going to use 3 to 4 cups of rhubarb. But even this way I don't have any left and even the people who swear they hate rhubarb loved this cake. Thanks for the recipe! It's defiantly a keeper!

Made this today with rhubarb just cut from the garden.  DH, who states he "doesn't like rhubarb just ate 2 large pieces after brunch, then I "busted" him in the kitchen sneaking another piece. -changes: used 1 rounded cup of sugar, and 3 cups finely diced rhubarb. Great recipe.  Will take to Mom's later-if there's any left!

This is a great recipe! The brown sugar topping adds the perfect finish to this cake. It really good right out of the oven if you are like me and can't wait to taste it! It never lasts long at our house so I try and make at least 2 at a time. Don't skimp on the 2 cups of rhubarb.I leave my chunks a little big also so you get that great tart flavor with each bite! YUMMY!!!!

I made this cake twice, the first time I used 3 cups of rhubarb and the milk/vinegar mixture because I didn't have buttermilk.  It was delicious.  My dad who loves rhubarb and my kids who had never had rhubarb, all loved it.  The second time, I used approximately 4 cups of rhubarb and used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of butter and the milk/vinegar mixture again.  I did not like it as well.  I really don't think it was the butter change, but rather the added rhubarb.  When I make it again, I will stick to 3 cups rhubarb.  That amount seems a good amount; not an overwhelming taste of rhubarb and it also held up better in the fridge.  More rhubarb seemed to take it from "coffee cake" to "soggy bread pudding" consistensy.

This was really tasty! I reduced the amount of white sugar by half and used frozen rhubarb instead of fresh (baking the cake for one hour instead of 45 minutes).  Will make again!

Thanks for the recipe, I will make it again. It was very moist and   my family loved it. I used brown sugar instead of white and a cream cheese frosting as a couple of people suggested. I decided to also put the cinnamon in the cake and it came out perfect, not too sweet  and with a hint of cinnamon

Last week, I found fresh rhubarb at Whole Foods.  I love rhubarb but you can't find it often especially in late January.  This cake was superb!  I did make a few changes as suggested in other reviews.  I increased the amount of rhubarb to 3 cups and added 1 cup of thawed whole cherries, used avocado oil instead of butter, instead of all white flour I used half whole wheat, used kefir (cultured milk) instead of buttermilk, and added about 1 tablespoon of rolled oats in the topping mixture.  Yummy!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I can tell it won't last long.

4 1/2 * -  I didn't rate this 5 stars because 2 cups rhubarb would not be nearly enough.  I used 4 cups rhubarb and it was delicious, quick and easy.  Will use this cake recipe with other fruit as well.

So good! It brings back fond memories of my grandmother's baking. My parent's neighbor gave me this recipe along with fresh rhubarb. It was really easy and was a hit at a potluck BBQ. Will definitely make again. Any tips on how to keep the rhubarb from sinking to the bottom?

This is the best rhubarb dessert I've ever tasted! I did add 3-4 cups rhubarb instead of the 2 cups the recipe calls for, and am glad I did; the tartness of the rhubarb helps to offset the sweetness of the 2 1/2 cups total sugar in the recipe. My family asked me to make another one as soon as the first one was gone.  Wonderful recipe; thanks!

This is an extremely moist,  delicious cake.  As recommended by other reviewers, I used half butter and half applesauce.  I also cut the sugar to one cup (using 1/2 c Splenda).  To further save calories, I just mixed a little brown sugar with cinnamon and sprinkled the top.  The cake was so delicious, I will not put any topping on my next version.  I also added blueberries to enhance the rhubarb.

This was so delicious!  I ran out of white sugar, so I used 1 cup of brown sugar and a half cup of white.    It was so moist and wonderful, and was even better the next day.  I can hardly wait to make it again!

This was really really good, and I am the type of cook who can find fault with anything I make!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I sub'd 3/4 cup milk, 1 tblsp lemon juice and 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also used three generous cups of rhubarb , and needed to bake it for 10 extra minutes.  I am going to try it with almond extract next time.  As is, this recipe is excellent.

VERY, VERY GOOD! I made this recipe last night to take to work today.  Everyone loved it and wants the recipe.  I used a scant tablespoon of lemon juice in milk instead of the  buttermilk.  I also used about 3 1/2 to 4 cups of rhubarb.  I will make this again and can't wait to share the recipe with the nice man that sold me the rhubarb at Farmer's Market. Thank you for sharing, Barb!

Yum! There was a tad too much topping, so I wound up throwing out about 1/8th of a cup. I had a little whipping cream left over so I used 1/3 whipping cream, and 2/3 milk with one tablespoon of lemon. I only had a cup of rhubarb, and it really would have been so much better with another cup but it still turned out perfect and moist!

Making this delicious rhubarb cake was a perfect reward at the end of my cleaning day. I guess I made quite a few changes to the original recipe. I substituted coconut oil for the butter and reduced the sugar (replacing the white sugar with brown) to one cup. I used finely ground 100% whole wheat flour, added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, and increased the rhubarb to four cups, finely chopped. In place of buttermilk, I added one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to one cup of vanilla almond milk. For the topping, I used approx. 1/4 cup of coconut oil, half a teaspoon of cinnamon, and maybe a tablespoon of brown sugar, sprinkling this over the batter once it was in my bundt pan--also a change. I cooked the cake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes. The result: a VERY moist, delicious cake. I WILL make this one again.

Delicious super-moist cake!  I didn't have any of the problems some seemed to have.  I am so glad I found a recipe that works for my son who can't have dairy (I subbed with earth balance and almond milk/vinegar).  I have another in the oven right now with half raspberry- trying to convert it to birthday cake format for him because other dairy free cake recipes aren't nearly as good.  But this recipe is good as is!

This was delicious... Both warm with ice cream and cold.  I used 3 cups of rhubarb and that was perfect. Like someone else mentioned, part of my topping sunk to the bottom but it was still good.  I wonder if putting the topping on half way through would prevent this from happening?

My mil gave me 1.5 cups of chopped rhubarb for this cake. Her recipe was a bit hard to follow, but had nearly the same ingredients except it called for only 1.5 cups rhubarb, white sugar only, and oil instead of butter. I found this recipe and followed it precisely, minus my lack of called for rhubarb. This recipe was much better. Butter & brown sugar make such a difference! If I had to make again, I'd probably add 3 or even 4 cups of rhubarb next time.

I've made this recipe at least 5 times now. It is fantastic! I add 4 cups of fresh or frozen rhubarb to it and top it with just a sprinkle of brown sugar and cinnamon. Amazingly delicious!

I loved the cake.  The brown sugar topping was delicious.  I will add more rhubarb next time I make it.  Everyone I served it to enjoyed it. I would bake it for about 40 min. next time.

June 2015 - I've upped my rating to 5 stars as I realize that I make this cake at least once a week during rhubarb season.  It's a very flexible and forgiving recipe.  Here are the tweaks I've developed:  I use a good 4 cups of rhubarb and only 1 c. of sugar in the batter (the streusel on top adds more than enough sweetness for the tart rhubarb).  I also think it's more flavorful with a mix of whole wheat and white flour (1 c. each).  Finally, adding 1/2 c. rolled oats to the topping gives it a bit more character.  I try to use butter always for the streusel, but sometimes use margarine in the batter - no problem!  Same with buttermilk - I use it when I have it, but if I'm out you can use milk with a teaspoon of lemon juice in it (let it sit for 5 min. before adding it to the batter).  Everyone always asks for seconds and my teen boys and their 8 year old brother request it all the time.

Yummy cake, but definitely needs more rhubarb than called for.  I used over 4 cups of rhubarb and thought it could've even used more.  But everything else was perfect and it made for a moist, dense coffee style cake.  Perfect served warm with ice cream.

This was delicious.  Moist and tart-sweet.  Cut sugar to 1 cup and increased rhubarb to 3 cups as other reviewers have, and used 1/2 c sugar mixed with 2 tsp cinnamon as the topping as suggested by one reviewer.  Also added 1/3 cup dried cranberries for the heck of it.  Yummy, will definitely make again!

This was ok.  I was concerned with the ratio of sugar to flour when I read this and so only used 1 1/4 c. white sugar.  It was still too sweet and I even used 3 c. rhubarb based on other recommendations.  If I try this again, I'll cut down to 1 c. white sugar.  I also was concerned that the ingredients didn't list baking powder.  I will add 1 t. next time since it was a little flat.  Nice and moist though.  I think if the proportions can be straightened out, this will be a great cake to use for my rhubarb.

This cake is great!  Called Lunar Rhubarb Cake in Canada.  I used 1c splenda + 1/2c sugar in the batter and 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4c splenda in the topping.  I found this to be plenty sweet.

I used one cup of white sugar, did the lemon juice thing to sour the milk, added four cups rhubarb and didn't put the struesel topping on (just cinnamon and sugar). Despite all these changes, the cake turned out great and I will make it again. Very adaptable recipe.

I really like this cake, it is a nice simple recipe and you can use any fruit. I used about 3-4 cups of fresh strawberries. I didn't find this cake too sweet like few others did.  I didn't make the crumble topping but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This is almost the exact recipe that my Mom has been making for years.  We have always called it "Moon Cake" because the butter sugar topping sinks in and it looks like creators on the surface of the moon.  Now that I have carried on the tradition and I am the only one in the house that eats rhubarb, I sometimes use frozen mixed berries and it is just as amazing.  Thanks for posting this recipe, it is my absolute favourite :)

REALLY good cake! I took the advice from a few other reviews and added some extra rhubarb (prob did about 3 and 1/2 cups total), and substitued 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour. Then I topped with diced strawberries before adding the crumbs. Sorry I usually don't review when I've made changes, but I really had to. I LOVE this recipe! I will be making again and again. Very moist and lots of flavor. Thank you for sharing!!!

Such an easy and yummy way to use rhubarb! I only used a cup of sugar for the batter and it was plenty sweet. Also used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. For the toppping I did 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1/3 c. oatmeal and ~2 tsp cinnamon. I forgot to put in the butter, but I probably wouldn't use 1/4 butter.

nice and moist - really good flavor - my daughter said it was the best thing I had ever cooked.

second time I made it the topping sunk to the bottom of the pan and made a delicious goo at the bottom of the cake - it's still good just didn't come out perfectly, I can't figure out why.

I made this today after reading the other reviews.  I added extra rhubarb, but like another reviewer, my topping sank to the bottom of the dish while baking.  It still tastes good but next time I think I will leave off the topping and just eat with whipped cream or make my own frosting.

I got great raves with this cake.  I added a cup of coarsely chopped walnuts to the batter and another cup of coarse chopped nuts to the topping.  It gives the cake a great crunchiness that it doesn't have otherwise.  Everyone at work raved about this cake.

I didn't read the other reviews first so the extra rhubarb may help, but WAY too sweet for my family.

I thought this was awesome.  It was my first time cooking with rhubarb so I followed the recipe exactly.  I should have taken the advice of the other posts and used far more rhubarb, but there will be a next time for sure!

Omg...SO moist and yummy!  I added an extra cup of rhubarb, but otherwise, the recipe is awesome just the way it stands.  By the way, if you want a crumbly top, don't melt the butter; cut it in while it is room temp.  I melted it and it sank to the bottom, but it was STILL so good.

This was amazing!  I took others advise and added twice as much rhubarb.  It was more like a cobbler than a cake.  So good and a must try.

I wasn't a fan of the brown sugar topping at all. I have a sweet tooth and all, but this was waaay too sweet. I would guess that 1/4 c brown sugar would be about right. The cake part was quite good, but def. in need of that extra cup of rhubarb that some other reviewers mentioned.

Are you kidding me?! This was wonderful! Didn't have 3 cups of rhubarb as other reviewers suggested so I added 1 cup cranberries for the tartness. Cut sugar back to 1 cup and added 1/4 oats and PRESTO...it was scrumptious!!

My husband would eat this daily if I made it.  Very moist, perfect blend of tastes.  I would have rated 5 stars but I did add 3 1/2 cups of rhubarb.  That makes it 5 stars in my book!

Loved this recipe but changed a few things. Replaced the white sugar with brown in the batter, added banana (2 cups) as I was out of rhubarb, and way less butter and sugar for the topping! Have already made twice and my hubby loves it1

HOLY COW! This is delicious!!! Kinda like coffee cake with a kick. I acquired about 5lbs of rhubarb, so I'm trying out a bunch of different recipes and I'm definitely making another cake... maybe two more.   ps. i used the vinegar and milk mixture and it was fine.  i was a bit scared because my cake doesn't look good (i may have done the topping wrong. i don't think you're suppose to melt the butter. oops.) but the look was deceiving. did i mention it's delicious!

As many suggested, used 4 cups rhubarb, cut back on the sugar a bit. I guess I didn't mix enough flour in with the rhubarb as it all sunk to the bottom. The topping mostly stayed on the top where it shoud be!

Our family loved this cake. I used half spelt flour and it was oober-moist. For the topping I used a couple tablespoons of oats(as suggested) and about a third less butter/sugar mixture. Still amazing and plenty of topping.  This is so good.

I thought this recipe was great and super easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers.  I only added 1 cup of sugar and 3 cups of rhubarb.  For the topping I just made Stusel topping...brown sugar, butter, flour, oatmeal and cinamon and crumble on top. I still felt the cake itself is missing something.  Maybe next time I will add 4 cups rhubarb and some lemon peel to the batter...or maybe more cinamon.   Overall I would definitly make this cake again.

Super delicious & moist.  Very easy to make. I used 4 cups of rhubarb and baked this cake for an extra 10 minutes...lots of rhubarb!  I also thought 1 cup of brown sugar for the topping was too much.  I only used 2/3 cup instead.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I substituted milk + lemon juice...for 10 minutes.  The sweet & tart flavours of this cake are superb!

This was excellent!  Very moist!  I used no fat sour cream and used about  1/2 cup more rhubarb.  Next time I would use a full 3 cups.  Vanilla ice cream is great with this.  Cooking time was right on.

Love this cake!  Used 3c. of rhubarb.  Didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted 1/2c. Milk and 1/2c. Sour Cream, as suggested by another reviewer.  It was even better the next day....so nice and moist, simply delicious.

This recipe was good.  It was much better once it set-up; it was cobber-like when it first came out of the oven.  I had to admit that if you are looking for a way to use up rhubarb, I prefer the Rhubarb Bread I recipe on this site.

I've been making this cake recipe for years too. The only difference is that I add 2 to 3 teaspoons of cinnamon in the batter. We love cinnamon, and it adds a little more flavour to the cake.

Very well received at Mothers day luncheon...Used 3 1/2 cups rhubarb and cut the sugar back to just one rounded cup. Very moist. I liked the brown sugar topping.

Love it!! This is an excellent cake, very light and moist -- and very easy to make.  I made the batter according to the recipe but instead of the topping I lightly sprinked the top with a cinnamon/sugar mixture, as that is the way I remember eating rhubarb cake as a child. Next time I think I will add cinnamon and nutmeg to the cake batter, as I love cinnamon.  I will also try baking it with strawberries.

Really good!! I used half n half because that's what I had - and a tbsp of lemon juice. I also used probably a little over four cups of rhubarb chopped in 1/2 inch chunks and I think next time I would leave them larger and use close to 5 cups. It cooked down so much there is not a strong rhubarb flavor. I decreased the sugar to one cup and used cake flour. I also added one cup of oats to the topping because I like the crunch it gives. Very good and as others have suggested likely really versatile with other fruits...
Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful and delicious. I know that it already has lots of reviews, but thought I would send mine, too. I did read through the other reviews and increased the rhubarb to 4 cups, reduced the sugar in the cake to 1 cup, and added oatmeal (1/3 cup) and a little more flour to the topping. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious! I made it 3 times. The second time, I left it in the oven a bit too long and it was a bit dry...still good...but not AS good. One of the best recipes ever! I made it with apples too, yum yum!
Ok  another day and another time that I’ve made the recipe only this time I made it with blueberries and added 3 cups. Instead of putting cinnamon in the brown sugar topping I added the brown sugar butter and lemon zest with a bit of lemon flavouring as well. I also added lemon to the cake mix as well...It’s in the oven as I speak, I’ll let you know how it tastes but I just know it’s going to be delicious!   This is an extremely versatile cake recipe!

I veganized this recipe and it worked out very well. I used 1 flegg in place of the egg.
¼c vegetable oil and ¼c applesauce in place of the recommended fat.
I used 4c of fruit (I would do 3c next time).
I used Earth Balance butter for the struesel topping and added ½c chopped nuts. 
It turned out delicious. I realize that is a lot of subs, but it worked well. It also needed an extra 15 min of cooking, probably because if the extra fruit.

I made four different desserts for an event and this recipe "took the cake." 
A few tweaks.....less sugar-1 1/4 cups in the batter and 1/2 c in the crumb topping. (Still plenty sweet)
I also added 1/3 c rolled oats in the crumb topping and used 
3 c rhubarb as some suggested. Only needed 37 minutes baking time and served it chilled.  A Keeper!

I have made this recipe a few times already.  The only change that I made was to replace half the butter in the cake with coconut oil because I ran out of butter in the house.

This is so excellent. I did put more rhubarb as suggested by others. I also didn't have buttermilk. I had to make my own. I cup whole milk and one Tablespoon of vinegar sit for 5 min or more until thick. It wont get as thick as store buttermilk. After dinner not a crumb was left in the pan. Very delish cake. I will make this and I will also try blueberry's .

Delicious.  This is a recipe that tastes better the 2nd and 3rd day after it rests, it becomes more moist inside.  My dad loves it as well and he can be hard to convince sometimes lol I add extra cup rhubarb than it calls for so there is some in every bite.

I love this rhubarb coffee cake. I used only 1 cup of sugar in the batter, for more rhubarb tartness. I also used less brown sugar and butter for the topping.

I doubled the rhubarb - really! - and skipped the butter in the topping crumbs. It did take longer to bake. Everyone loved it. I will definitly bake it again this year and every rhubarb season.

I was super impressed with how this recipe turned out and I'm making it again today to share with family.
I used a 400g packet of frozen rhubarb that I  keep for rhubarb pure and was very pleased with the results.

A good basic recipe. The first time I made it with 4 cups of rhubarb per reviews. It was good but still pretty sweet. The second time I made it with 2 cups rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries, reducing sugar in batter by 1/4 cup and making only a half recipe of the topping. That was also very good. I am anxious to try other fruits such as apples and peaches.

A very good recipe! It is sweet, but I have a sweet tooth so I don't mind! The rhubarb gave nice tartness to the cake and the topping gave a nice crunchiness to the otherwise soft cake. I will definitely make this cake again! Luckily for me I have rhubarb growing in my back yard, so just have to wait for them to grow a bit bigger! I really want to try this recipe with tart apples- I think it would also make a great combination.

Excellent recipe, though way too much sugar.  I made it again using only 1 cup, and it was still more than enough.  Otherwise, moist, delicious and flavourful.

Excellent!  Best cake I've ever made.  Like others, I doubled the amount of rhubarb and cut back a bit on sugar and baking time.  Best of all, I substituted the topping with a cream cheese frosting that I use on carrot cake.  Even my husband, who rarely eats dessert, loved it.

Love. This.    I used 3-4 cups of rhubarb and 1 cup of sugars per recommendation of others.  It's the best rhubarb dessert.  I like that it doesn't need another fruit to make it awesome.

``````````This was easy and very tasty. I'm going to work on how to get the sugar topping to be more crumbly and less sticky. Definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again soon.

I made these as a muffin, and they were just OK. I cut the sugar in half as I like the tart rhubarb flavor. The crumb topping just melted and wasn't crunchy, and I felt the flavor wasn't great. These were a good starting place to build on, and I'll add spices and a different crumb topping.

Delicious and moist. I've made it twice now, the first time with fresh rhubarb and studied milk(no buttermilk on hand), the second time with frozen (thawed) rhubarb and buttermilk. Both times the results were awesome! This will be my rhubarb cake recipe from now on. Thank-you!!!

I made this with a few slight changes. I used half stevia and half sugar, I also used half flour and half coconut flour. I actually had to add a 1/4 c buttermilk to thin it out a bit. I must say, it was AWESOME! thank you for the recipe! and yes if you want to cut down on the sugar and carbs the way I did, it was delish!!

Glad I read the reviews. Used extra rhubarb & baked an extra 15 minutes.  It was awesome!  My husband and son were disappointed I wasn't making pie....at first ??. Once they tasted the cake, they were no longer disappointed.  Thanks for the keeper.

Much too sweet even though I cut down the brown sugar. Also the brown sugar\butter topping goes through the cake and all you taste is sweet.  No flavour of the rhubarb.

Really good!  This made a full 9x13 pan - and it was a lot!  Mine was not pink and pretty like the photo (my rhubarb cooked into a more brownish color) but the taste was great.

Very nice. I used about 3 1/2 cups of frozen rhubarb, and let it partially thaw which reduced it to just over 2 cups.  I then used 1/4 cup of the juice to sour the milk (reduced to 3/4 cup to compensate).   Next time, I will reduce the sugar to one cup and reduce the topping, as I prefer a tart cake.  I will also increase the rhubarb to four cups, frozen.

This was delicious! I made it for a crowd and everyone loved it! My husband had it for breakfast this morning! Our oven tends to bake hot so I baked it for 5 minutes less and it came out perfectly! I will definitely be making it again!

This is certainly a moist cake and dense as others has said. The rhubarb flavor was not as strong as I would have liked. I wish I had followed the advice to double the rhubarb. The real problem was the topping. I had the same problem as another reviewer - the topping sinking to the bottom of the cake.  It was impossible to remove from the pan in anything remotely resembling a square or a slice. I'm a pretty experienced baker so can't figure out quite what went wrong. And, while good, the cake wasn't outstanding enough for me to want to go back and figure out how to fix it.  As is, it was okay but not worth repeating.

An easy and delicious cake.  Great hot out of the oven, cold the next day, or reheated in the microwave.  I can imagine this would be amazing with ice cream, although I did not try that myself.  I made this as written, with double rhubarb based on previous reviewer's comments.

Just made this gem!  It was very good.  I chopped most of my rhubarb in a food processor and cut some into 1/2 inch chunks.  I did cut  down the sugar to 1 cup in the cake and added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  .  I may go with less sugar next time in the cake.  The cinnamon topping sinks down into the cake making it almost like a pudding cake.  My husband loved it.  It smells heavenly!  Thank you

Very good recipe, but i did change just a few things. Instead of 2 cups of rhubarb I used 3 cups I also added about 10 dollops of strawberry jam just under the top layer. The top crumble layer I added about a half a cup of oatmeal to the mix to make a nice crumble. Finish with a scoop of your favorite ice cream

I am eating this cake right now, and it's wonderful! I read previous reviews and added extra rhubarb, I had about 4 cups already chopped so I used it all. The taste is fantastic, not too sweet and every bite has a zip of rhubarb. The only minor problem with adding so much extra rhubarb is that the cake is more likely to fall apart when cutting it into squares. I personally dont have a problem with that!

I made this cake a few weeks ago and it was so delicious that I ate pretty much the whole thing by myself.  My hubby did manage to get a couple of pieces and he raved on about how great it was and he doesn't even like rhubarb! I used 4 cups rhubarb, added about 1/4 cup of flour to the topping and served it with ice cream.  I am making this again tonight and wanted to thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

I have a lot of rhubarb. So I decided to do something different from a crumble. 
Yes it is amazingly lovely and sweet and fruity.
I would not put as much topping on next time. because I burnt it. Lovely on a winters day with some custard I thing..
Thank you for sharing with us all.

My daughter made this cake for her boyfriend tonight.  I think we are missing 1 step.  Cook it in a large skillet, and when it's done cooking, flip it over onto a plate, like a pineapple upside down cake.  This way, all the brown sugary sweetness will sit on top of the cake instead of the stuck to the bottom of the 9x13 baker.

Loved this cake as a coffee cake. I had 4 cups of frozen rhubarb that I used. I drained out the juice and it was the same amount that my dry buttermilk mix called for mixing with water. So I used the juice and didn't add water at all. I chopped in some pecans as well.

I was really disappointed by this cake. I LOVE rhubarb and was looking for a cake where I could taste the rhubarb. This one definitely doesn't fit that bill. Based on other reviews I used twice the rhubarb (4 cups) and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. The result was still too sweet for me, and I couldn't taste the rhubarb at all. The cake was moist, but the fruit could have equally well been apples, or maybe even zucchini... The overwhelming flavor was cinnamon. So I recommend it if you want a very sweet, moist cinnamony coffee cake, but for something rhubarby, I will have to keep looking. :(

Love this recipe and have made both as a cake and as cupcakes. Added a few handfuls of blueberries and used the adaption of milk or 1/2 and 1/2 with vinegar. Also for less sweet omit the brown sugar topping and add cinnamon to the batter. Yum! :)

As is, WAY TOO SWEET!  I hate being the one who says nay when there are obviously many who disagree with me, but rhubarb desserts should have a little "tart" to them, don't you think?  There was far too much sugar.  I think it would have been bearable had I left the insane amount of sugar topping off.  I don't know...I will not be making this one again.  The search continues.

A bit on the sweet side but a yummy recipe noe the less. I'd be hesitant about adding more than 2.5 cups of rhubarb, it's pretty moist already.

This was a great success!!  I did follow others advise and added 4 cups of rhubarb, and added extra topping and icing.  I know not very healthy but very good.

Amazing! My only issue was with the topping. 1/4 cup butter mixed with the brown sugar and cinnamon....I mixed it up and it was very goopy, there was no way that was getting "sprinkled" onto the top of the cake. I ended up spreading it on and sorta marbling it into the top of the cake....still delicious!

We really liked this cake.  I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour and Splenda instead of sugar.  For the topping I used brown sugar Splenda and added some oatmeal.  It was great.

Not what I was expecting....having grown up with rhubarb, i've had the opportunity to try ALOT of variations, this one is nothing special, I used 4c of rhubarb and omitted the butter in the topping, turned out good, but it jest needed more flavoring, maybe nutmeg inclded would make a bit better......

Terrific cake!  My husband took this to work to share with his coworkers and they gobbled it up.  I used 2 cups rhubarb and also added about 1 cup blueberries.  My cake took about 50 minutes to bake and it is more like a coffee cake, which I love.  This is a great summer cake and the topping is wonderful!

I made this for my family  this weekend. After reading the reviews of other cooks, I took the suggestion to increase the rhubarb to four cups and am glad that I did so.  The cake was fantastic and got rave comments from everyone.  This recipe is definitely one that I will make again and again!

Delicious!!  I just loved this recipe.  I added 4 cups of rhubarb and skipped the topping but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  The cake with the extra rhubarb came out more like a pudding which was perfect.  Thank you so much.  I will definitely be making this recipe throughout the season.

If you love cinnamon topping, you might really enjoy this recipe. I found that it took away from the rhuarb flavor. If this recipe were on Iron Chef, it would get marked down for not having enough flavor or the main ingredient, rhubarb. I would highly recommend the Rhubarb Dream Bars if you are looking for something different. They were delicious!!!

To be fair, I don't like rhubarb, neither does anyone in my house. Having said that, others thought this was good. I will use other fruit, as I think this base is good, and easy to do. Thanks!

I loved the cake part! I didn't care for the crumble top. Most crumble topping has flour in it and will stay on top of the cake. I am going to make it next time with a favorite crumble topping recipe. I think it would be 5 star. NOTE: I also used 4 cups of rhubarb as suggested by others. As I said the cake part was perfect. Mine baked in 38 minutes.

I thought this was a very tasty cake.  I agree with other that say to add more rhubarb.  I also thought it was a bit sticky and hard to get out of the pan.  Not the most beautiful cake, but yummy.

A delicious light and fluffy cake. I like it because it's not super sweet, but the topping gives it a light sweetness. The topping should be made with cold butter to make it crumbly though, but that's the only thing that I would change.

Delicious.  Threw in a few raspberries I had kicking around and probably upped the rhubarb amount (I didn't measure) but stuck to the rest of the recipe.

This cake was fabulous! I was slightly disappointed that the high amount of sugar made the rhubarb hard to taste, but I got over that! The streusel doesn't stay on top, it all falls to the bottom. We ended up making ours into a kind of upside down cake. This cake would also be good with apples I think. Anyways, no major changes other than I think I'll cut back on the sugar a bit next time. Great cake though!

Don't try putting it into muffin cups.  The batter is too cake like and not muffin like for that.  They overflow and make a mess.  Next time I will put it in the proper pan.  Only change I made was adding a cup more rhubarb and topping it with a bit of cinnamon sugar.  Very moist.

Amazing cake! I agree that a little more rhubarb definately adds a lot, the batter is great but a little to much topping for my liking. Warning this cake won't last long ;)

The taste was there, used 3 cups rhubarb and vinegar/milk substitute for buttermilk, however like another reviewer, the topping went to the bottom of the cake which made a mushy consistency and not sliceable the way a cake should be--left looking for more "cake" in the cake-the oatmeal added may help this but wanted to try the original recipe first and was not looking for an oatmeal topping Experienced as a baker, but looking for suggestions to keep topping on top!

This cake is soooooooooo good!  "How good is it?" you ask?  It is soooooooooo good, that when a friend took it to a pot luck last weekend, the few remaining pieces were stolen!  The culprit returned with empty pan in hand the next day, saying she just couldn't help hersef.

This was an easy and delicious cake. I listened to the reviews of many and used 3.5-4 cups (approx.) rhubarb instead of 2 cups and otherwise followed the recipe as written. The cake turned out VERY moist- a cross between coffee cake and pound cake. The flavors improve the next day and so on. (If it lasts that long.) I followed the suggestions for the buttermilk substitution also :)

totally delicious. i made this for mothers day and my mum thought it was excellent. so excellent that she has asked me to make another one today. i read some of the other reviews, and two cups is not enough. the first time i made it i used three cups and that should definitely be the minimum. i'm using three again this time because i think it's a good balance but feel free to use four or more! also, keep an eye on your cake! in my oven, it didn't even take forty minutes to bake. i didn't keep an eye on it and the top layer got a little too dark. which reminds me, the topping (which is technically a streusel) is AMAZING. great to have on top. the crunch mixed with the moist cake is perfect.

Amazing! I've made three rhubarb cakes this week, my husband can't get enough! I like a lot of rhubarb so I increased the amount to 2 1/2 cups. This recipe is easy and delicious.

This was excellent!  The only thing I would change would be to add more rhubarb.  I added 3 cups and it could even use a little more. Thank you for the great recipe

What a moist, delicious cake.  I followed one reviewer's advice and used about 3 cups of rhubarb.  This cake was even better the next day. It's also very simple to make.  Thank you!

I don't think I'd make this again.  I find a little boring.  If I modified and maybe added some more spices and apples or something.  It's not bad, just not spectacular for me.

Awesome!  One of my pregnant friends was craving rhubarb coffee cake & I have tons of rhubarb, so picked this recipe.  I took it into work & told my friend to take as much as she wanted & put the rest in the coffee room...it was gone in minutes, with rave reviews.  I'm making another one today because hubby wants some too.  I used some of the previous reviewers suggestions & cut back the sugar to 1 cup & I upped the rhubarb to 3 cups.  Excellent!!  Thank you.

i have made this cake today, and it turned out very good.
But i used only 200g sugar for the batter,
and 100g for the "streusel".
The cake is sweet enough this way.
Thank you for the recipe!

Very Tasty!!  I cut back the sugar to 1-1/4 cups and found that to be plenty. Will definately make again during Rhubarb season.

Different from Mom's with the addition of the brown sugar topping, which makes it like a crumb/coffee cake.  Leave off if frosting...

This cake was soooooooo good.  I used four cups of rhubarb and made a batch and a half of the topping for extra gooeyness.  My husband loved it but said it needed nuts, so I'll be sure to do that next time.  And believe me, there WILL a next time, and soon!

This cake was absolutely delicious.  My family loved the moist cake with the sweet topping.
