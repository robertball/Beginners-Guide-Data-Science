This was great! I added cranberries to my mix. I also used turkey bacon. No seasonings needed. Great dish. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious. I noticed this didnt have any seasonings and since I am a salt fiend, I brined the chicken first. Used turkey bacon and a lower cal/fat blue cheese.. Scrumptious!

Delicious and easy to fix. I chopped the walnuts and (because I didn't have blue cheese) substituted grated Watonga Onion Cheddar cheese.

This was delicious - as others have said!  I added a caramelized onion to the mix Yum!  I didn't add any seasoning as I didn't really think it would need it since the cheese and the bacon are salty.  
I did this wrong though, instead of spreading the filling I just put put the filling in the middle of the breast.  Next time I'll do it right so I get the pinwheel effect!!

Very nice and easy to make. Make sure to pound the chicken to as thin as indicated. :)

I made it with chicken thighs, cut them and wrapped it in bacon. It was different but still yummy.

It's a keeper!!
After I pounded the chicken out, I salt and peppered them. Then I spread a little blue cheese dressing followed by a few more blue cheese crumbles. Then I added crushed pecans instead of walnuts.   Yum!!

Made it as is and it was delicious! Even my husband who always complains about "too much chicken" loved it. Hooray for cheese and nuts! This will be in the regular rotation.

Very tasty, no need to add salt or seasonings. I did not pound my chicken and it was fine. Also I will use a little less stuffing the next time I make it.

My husband said to definitely make this again. We are on a low carb diet so this was exactly what we needed. I already had marinaded chicken breasts in Italian dressing so I used those. Perfect.
