We are not big on spinich. I am always looking for recipes to sneak in the yucky veggies. This was great, The cheese topped the whole thing off. There was not a piece left on my kids plates.

My husband loved this and it was very easy and quick to make...  Added oregano, garlic and lots of Parmesan Cheese during cooking which gave it lots of flavor.  Also used Regular Tomato Sauce with diced tomatoes.

I haven't even made this yet and I can tell this will be a family favorite.  I have fussy eaters and this recipe is not difficult.  I always have all of these ingredients but not always the creativity.

I used chicken tenderloins and skipped the cheese because I didn't have any.  I think the cheese would have made these phenomenal, but this was still a great recipe!

We really enjoyed this meal. I probably liked it better than hubby because he is not as fond of spinach than I am. And it was a lot of tomato flavor from the marinara sauce. Over all it was a nice change from regular pork chops. Will probably make this again, just not too often for the sake of hubby's tastes. I still loved it though, and got to claim the leftovers ;)

Great idea to do something different with pork chops. Don't forget to season the chops before sauteing them - I used salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I used garlic and onion pasta sauce and omitted the spinach (hubby doesn't like it) and the onion. I suppose you could use a florentine-style pasta sauce as a shortcut. I just poured the sauce in the pan with the chops when they were almost done, topped them with the cheese, and let it simmer until the cheese was nice and melty. I served this over brown rice pasta so it was kind of like a pork version of chicken parmesan. I'd definitely make this again.

This is very similiar to a Chicken Squisito recipe that I already had on hand from the back of a Sorrento cheese bag. Why I didn't think to broaden my scope to pork eludes me? Extremely simple recipe and great in a pinch, when you can't think of what to do with pork chops. (Served with roasted spaghetti squash and garlicky green beans & peas)

Just made this tonight and it was very nice;  it didn't blow our socks off, but it was simple, quick, and inexpensive.  I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before browning, and added some home-grown fresh basil and oregano with the mozzarella.  It probably needs some extra garlic, maybe a few dried red pepper flakes to just bump it up a level.  Hubby loved it, so I'll make it again!  Thanks!

I took some other people's advice and seasoned the chops with some seasoning salt and some pepper before browning them.  I also threw in some garlic and mushrooms when I added the sauce.  Also I only had fresh spinach so I waited until the end to add that.  This was awesome!  An easy 5 stars.  Thanks for adding!

Big disappointment - just made it tonight & writing a review now because it truely was not memorable.  Not exciting - my husband ate it & so did I but I get why he honestly could not comment on the dish - all he could say is 'ehh' & I have to agree ... I followed the recipe - did season the chops before cooking with S&P but very blah ... and it really did not look appetizing [I even threw the finished dish under the broiler to make the cheese golden instead of drippy] ... whatever, will not make this again ...

I seasoned the pork chops prior to browning as other reviews have suggested.  As I was doing that I realized I had no jarred spaghetti sauce and had to make my own!  It was good, honey said it was VERY good.  My only issue was getting over the pork with red sauce as I have only grilled or made with cream of (insert soup here).  All in all, I'm very pleased to have another way to make pork chops and it was very tasty.
