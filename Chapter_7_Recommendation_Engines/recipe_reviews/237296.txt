I enjoyed this, but was caught a little off guard by the first taste. You really have to love grapefruit, which I do, because that's mostly what you taste, and this drink can be quite sour, depending on your grapefruit. You also get a nice subtle ginger flavor in the background. Very refreshing and super healthy. Mine didn't come out as a smoothie consistency - more like a really cold juice.  I cut the tops and bottoms off the grapefruits, then cut the peels off and proceeded to segment the fruit with a sharp knife so as to not put the membranes in. I just prefer it this way and it cuts some of the bitterness. For those who don't like sour, you may want to add a bit of sweetener to your "smoothie".

I made my smoothie with peeled grapefruit including the white membrane, fresh skinned pineapple, one inch piece of fresh ginger peeled, 1 tablespoon of chia seeds, 8 drops of homemade Splenda, 12 oz of water & 2 handfuls of fresh spinach tossed in my 1100 watt Ninja blender and it's fantastic.  I could not taste the spinach; the grapefruit & ginger melded well.

Had a nice fresh flavor and felt good knowing how healthy it is. Just one thing... I must not have cut the ginger enough since I had a few "hairlike" pieces in my smoothie. Would love to know how to rectify that.

It was okay at first, but it kinda tastes like sour grass. Perhaps this is because I don't know how to measure 3 ounces of spinach, but I wouldn't recommend.
