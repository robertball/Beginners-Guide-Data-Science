I grew up eating Ragout de Boulettes, served over potatoes. As a French Canadian, my mom, my aunts and grandmothers each had their own variation.  These were different than what I'm used to - mostly the seasonings and the method - but still tasty.   I didn't have enough flour left over to thicken at the end, so I ended up having to use a bit of cornstarch since I didn't have time to brown more flour. Thanks for sharing!

I did not use flour.  I mixed the cloves,  cinnamon, mustard powder, s&p together then rolled meatballs in it.  Browned meatballs, then added a small amount of water matched by a small amount of white wine.  Cooked about 30 minutes. Delicious.
