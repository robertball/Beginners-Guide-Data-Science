very good stuff! after a trial run prior to bird day, i made a couple small changes. i fried about 6 pieces of bacon, fried some onion and the garlic in the butter and some bacon grease then proceeded with the recipe. i'll add more bacon next time. i crumbled the bacon and covered with the cheeses. big hit!

Loved this!  Great use of summer staples.  I thought I had mozzarella in the fridge but it turns out it was muenster - so I used it anyway.  It was great.  I did half of the topping as directed, but on half I mixed in a couple of Tablespoons of Italian seasoned bread crumbs with the Parmesan.  Very yummy - thanks for the great recipe!

Really yummy.  I actually only used 2 zucchini's thinly sliced and sauted/browned in EVOO.  I did two layers - zucchini/garlic, 2 oz mozz, tomato, zucchini, 2 oz mozz, basil, tom and then topped with a cup of grated Parm.  Light and yummy.  I calculated about 310 calories per serving, but that is because I needed more oil since doing zucchini in batches.

One of my favorite recipes already! I used all fresh quality ingredients, minus the tomatos the first time because mine had gone bad. You can bet I am going to make this again soon with the tomatos and over and over again. I am looking forward to bringing this as a dish to the next party we are invited to.

I made this now two times.  The first time I did half the recipe and had to cook the zucchini in 3 batches. I cooked on medium but, I still had to rinse the pan with some hot water in between batches to avoid scorched garlic. I also don't usually have fresh basil, so I subtituted dry basil. My bottle said 1 Tablespoon of fresh = 1 teaspoon of dry.  I figured it did not matter because it was going to be baked anyway in this recipe. I ate the gratin with a ribeye steak that day.  It takes a little time, but it did make an elegant meal. The second time I tried another quicker version. I roasted the first 3 ingredients in the oven first. After about 20 minutes, or when the zucchini was very lightly browned, I removed from the oven and added the rest of the ingredients and then baked the additonal amount of time. It did not display as well as the original recipe, but equally as tasty! Interesting recipe, thanks for submitting Phil.

This is really good and very simple to make AND if you are like me and have gazillions of tomato's and zucchini from your garden... well... give it a try. I add a ton more basil than they call for (literally a ton more!). And before baking it I sprinkle it with bread crumbs so it gets nice and crusty on top... OH...  and I add some capers as well. Works really nicely with feta cheese if you are feta cheese lover. I sprinkle the feta on top of the zucchini and tomatoes and basil than cover the whole thing in a layer of Moz cheese. Serve with good homemade bread and you won't hear complaints.

DH and I really enjoyed this. Although I love zucchini, in many recipes the mild flavor gets lost or covered by stronger flavors. That is not the case here. The zucchini is just as much of a star as the tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. I also love that the ingredients are those that I usually have on hand. Very easy to prepare, pretty presentation and delicious. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding approx. 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs to the cheese/basil topping. I will happily prepare this often. Thanks for sharing!

The beauty is in it's simplicity.  I laid it out just as you pictured it, Phil, and it was delicious.  I served it with sliced baguettes schmeared with a mix of softened butter, parmesan, and garlic powder, toasted in the oven for 5 minutes.  There's none left!

This is simple perfection in a baking dish, and pretty quick to put it together.  The only thing I had to do differently was to saute my garlic separately as it over browned when I put it in the pan with the zucchini.  I just sprinkled it between the layers as I assembled the gratin.  I also found that on my stove top, 8 minutes a side was quite a bit too long for the zucchini, I just cooked them until they started to soften and brown a bit. The flavors are incredible, everyone enjoyed this!

This was very good indeed. I thought that the 8 minutes specified was rather OTT (over the top) so I ignored the timing and just paid attention to the colour. This ended up at somewhere between 4 and 5 minutes as it happens, the second side doing a lot quicker than the first of course. I love the way the tastes combine and are yet individually detectable. I was surprised at how liquid it still was at the bottom of the dish, on my first try. I did it first just like that, slicing the Courgettes and then cooking them and then did the suggestion in the footnotes about drawing the liquid out first. This was a far drier result, I was quite shocked how much! So my final version nowadays is with the dried courgettes and with the breadcrumb topping suggested by other reviewers. Thanks for this, I have some vegetarian friends and am always looking for different recipes for them. This was a HUGE success.

This is fantastic!  So easy to put together and so fresh tasting.  I have a smaller casserole pan than a 9x13, so I used 3 ripe-on-the-vine tomatoes, 3 small zucchini and 8oz of mozzarella. I layered zucchini on the bottom, followed by the cheese, and then the tomatoes topped with dried basil and parmesan. I added the garlic only in the final minute of sauteeing the zucchini so it wouldnt burn. One tip: if you remove the seeds from the tomatoes, it will eliminate the extra juice. This is so, so good and totally a keeper. Very yummy!

This was really good! The only problem that I ran into was it was very watery, maybe I should have dried the mozzarella with a paper towel? But very good recipe, even my boyfriend who isn't a huge fan of zucchini loved it!

Yum, yum, & yum!   We loved this!   I made exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of using 1 tsp. dried basil instead of fresh.  I am sure it would be even more amazing using fresh basil.  I made this at the end of the summer season, so, the tomatoes were not at their summer's best, but, this dish transformed them.  Definitely will be making this again. 9/5/14 Just a note - absolutely use fresh basil - it makes a HUGE difference.  The basil infuses big flavor into the tomato and cheese.  So good!

This was wonderful! I had to make something for a pot-luck last night.  I didn't have time to go to the store, but I have a garden producing lots of zucchini and tomatoes.  I didn't have mozzarella, but I had pepper jack cheese.   I did have enough time to salt and drain the zucchini, and I'm glad I did.  I have found zucchini recipes to get really WET.  This was just perfect!   I got so many wonderful complements!  I am definitely making this again.... there is still a lot of summer left!

This is a fantastic dish.  I used a lot of fresh basil and some roasted garlice I had on hand while baking.  We ate it in 3 meals and each time received compliments from my dear BF.  It tastes healthy and fresh and yummy.  Will be doing this again.

This dish not only tastes fabulous, but what a beautiful presentation as well! I used my garden fresh tomatoes & zucchini and used fresh mozzerella. I served this with homemade Italian marinara and Ciabatta bread....what a delightful Italian meal!

This was great! My zucchini was huge, so I quartered it and then cut into quarter inch slices. I used deli mozzarela cheese that I cut into quarters. The parmesan and basil topping was amazing! I loved this dish and will definitely be making it again. Thanks Phil!

Good Grief!  I have no idea why I waited so long to make this- it is simply OUTSTANDING!!!  I was just about to pop a frozen veggie in the microwave, when I remembered I had just picked fresh zucchini and tomatoes from my garden.  I recalled seeing this recipe and decided to try it!  I could not have been more thrilled with the results.  I am growing cherry tomatoes, so I halved a bunch of those.  This is truly an incredibly flavorful dish, and it makes a lovely presentation.  So, when my family plowed through the entire thing without hardly leaving me any behind, I decided to make myself a mini version in a ramekin.  I just layered it up, baked it til warm and bubbly (I wasn't really timing it, but I would guess maybe 15 minutes), and viola- a gorgeous presentation!!!  I am contemplating hosting a dinner party just to be able to serve these little ramekins of awesomeness!  Thanks so much Phil...this is most definitely something I will make often and with much anticipation :)

Very good - and easy, which is what I like. Because of that, I have been making this often. I usually just half the recipe as there are only two of us at dinner. Also, it turns out just as good even when I am too lazy to peel the tomatoes or pre-sautee the zucchini. The last time I made this I hardly had any mozzarella left, so I used a combo of mozzarella and swiss cheese - delish!

This dish is quite lovely. I was lazy tonight and didn't cook the zuke before layering it and it was still delicious! It smelled heavenly while it was baking. I sprinkled minced garlic on top and used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. Can't wait to have it again tomorrow! Thanks Swiss Phil!

I used more garlic and added it after I turned the zucchini, right before I put it in the casserole, thus just sauteeing it till soft and not crunchy.  I used 4 cloves of garlic and put 2 in after each of two batches of zucchini.

Good recipe, only change I did and would suggest is to skip fying the zucchini in oil first.  I found it to be too greasy.  So while the first batch was just about done in the oil, and to salvage this, I put the rest of the sliced zucchini in bowl and microwaved for 2 minutes to slightly soften.  THEN followed directions about layering and baking.  VERY TASTY!!

I made this last night as a side dish and it was wonderful!!!  My boyfriend wouldn't stop eating it!  Even as I was preparing it he kept picking at it! My son who is 16 didn't want to try it at first, but after one bite it was all gone! Would definately make this again! Only thing I did differently was add some bread crumbs on top!!

Excellent dish! I served it as a main dish. Sliced some rosemary and olive oil focaccia, brushed with olive oil and broiled, and served the gratin on top of the slices. Delicious!!

Phil, this was awesome! My husband even ate it and I would have bet against him evey trying it. The flavors were perfect. I used fresh mozzarella and I didn't actually measure the ingredients. I cut the recipe down and only used one zucchini and 3 Roma tomatoes, all fresh from the garden. I'll be making this one again VERY soon! Thanks for sharing!

This was very, very good (prob 4.5 stars) and oh so pretty!  I am sure I will make it again, as it is made with items that I usually have on hand.  I served this as a casserole main dish, and will have to admit that I added some slices of smoked sausage (hubby looks at me funny if there is no meat on the table lol).  However, this recipe is perfect as is, and we really enjoyed it!

I am the author of this recipe and I am a little upset that the description of how to present this dish is being misunderstood. The idea is to have the food arranged in alternating stripes of colours. Why? Because this is supposed to represent the Italian Flag. Stripes of green followed by stripes of white, followed by stripes of red. So take your zukes, lean them up against the wall of the baking dish and create an entire row of green - then lean a row of cheese against this, then a row of tomato ----- simple. It is NOT supposed to be layered from top to bottom. See some of the earlier pictures - 15, 20 and 26 at the moment.

Easy, healthier and lighter than eggplant parmesian or fried zucchini! I took it to a party with a lot of meat eaters and this dish was the hit of the party!

Delicious! Only change was to use a combination of grated fontina cheese and mozzarella because I was cleaning out the fridge.  Zucchini, tomato and basil were all fresh from the garden.  Lovely to look at and perfect balance of yummy summer flavors!  I served as a side to pasta with olive oil, garlic and parmesan.

Excellent recipe.  Fresh tomatoes & basil make it a hit.  I definitely recommend salting & drying the zucchini.   I chopped up the ends of the tomato, left over basil, parm & garlic and sprinkled on top before baking.  Delicious!  A definite do-over.

Yummy...I made one mini change and that was that I cut my zucchini into long slices instead of coin sized pieces, drizzled a little olive oil, sea salt and pepper and roasted in the oven instead of pan frying them. What a tasty dish....fresh basil is a must. So light and tasty.  Thanks for a great side dish. I also used roma tomatoes which got super sweet as this dish cooked.

Everyone really enjoyed this recipe!  I made it exactly as written except to add more fresh basil (I probably used about 1/4 cup total).  It had a delicious flavor and lovely presentation.  I look forward to making it again!

YUM! Made this more like a layered lasagna. Roasted the zuchnni and garlic/olive oil in the oven for a while to brown the bottoms, then did layers with the tomatoes, basil, and very light cheese. Topped off with some parm and breadcrumbs. WINNER! My mom asked me for the recipe!

This is a very good recipe to use up your crops  of zucchini however it is very time consuming if you are a working mom like me this is not for week nights dinner unless you were off the whole day and could of started at early enough time.This being said it was good recipe we enjoyed it

I serve this over spaghetti.  I slice up the zucchini and tomato and layer in pan, season with italian seasoning, garlic, salt and pepper.  Topped with shredded mozzarella and basil. I couldn't believe how easy and tasty this was.  Husband approved.

Pretty darn good! I would've given five stars except I felt a little guilty each time I ate a big glob of delicious cheese, kinda made me feel like the dish wasn't as healthy as I would have liked, but in terms of taste, very good! I made the recipe exactly as stated, though I didn't take the time to stack everything in as nice of layers since we were getting pretty hungry and the rest of dinner was coming together more quickly. I had the zucchini on top, which were then covered with the parm and basil, I think this was a good choice because of the three main ingredients, the zucchini is the most bland to me, so it was good to know every bite of it was spiced up a bit. I will probably make this again, though slice the cheese even thinner or perhaps cut back a bit so I don't feel so guilty.

this was amazing!i was a bit skeptical before trying this dish, thinking it might be plain or not filling enough... but boy was i wrong!  I followed the directions as stated, but changed a few things to fit what i had on hand: i sauteed two large zucchini in olive oil and garlic, then layered that intermittently with 4 on-the-vine tomatoes and 4 slices smoked swiss cheese instead of the mozarella. i think that enhanced the flavor a great deal. (i layered from bottom to top though, not side by side).  Layered twice then topped with 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese and 2 tsp dried sweet leaf basil.  I served over sourdough bread for a nice, refreshing dinner.  I will definitely be making this again and would feel very confident serving this dish to guests.  I highly suggest you try this!

Not too impressed. Followed the recipe. Found 8 min to be too long too cook the zucchini slices per side. Burned the earlier ones - dropped time down to 5 min per side. Very time consuming to cook the slices, (even with 2 fry pans going at the same time).  Given the work involved, the overall taste, (neutral) and the calorie intake (pretty high) - I'll probably not try this one again.

We have a farmers market that we get heirloom tomatoes from so that is what we used. This dish was a keeper. But the only think I will do is put the bread crumb topping. It was missing that crunch. But presentation was fabulous!. Red tomato's, yellow zucc, white cheese.

Delicious!!  I halved the recipe for the two of us as a side and it was perfect.  I did follow the footnote and drew liquid out of the zucchini before frying it.  I had no problem with excess liquid in the bottom.  We loved it and will do this one again for sure!  Thanks, Phil.

This was a great dish and a great new recipe to use up all the zucchini in the garden. I did all the same except I thought more along the lines of making eggplant parmesan which usually has a breading or flour coating of some sort and instead of just having plain parmesan on the top I combined 1/2 cup of parmesan with 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs ,mixed with two tblsp of melted butter, then sprinkled that over the top - my pic is number 16.

You can also put large cans of tomatoes, etc. in a plastic bag and put them on top of the plate for weight.  I tried that when I made Kim Chee and it worked great.

Yum- so good. I made half the recipe and ate the whole pan, then realized the recipe was only written for two servings- thank goodness! Delicious and gorgeous, will make frequently! I used zucchini and yellow tomatoes from my garden. Perfect.

This was awesome and a great way to use up zucchini in the summer.  My husband doesn't usually like zucchini and he loved it!  I only sauteed the zucchini about 2 minutes per side, and I used havarti cheese instead of mozzarella since that's all I had.  It was delicious - potluck or even holiday-worthy!

Wonderful recipe! I'm not a big fan of tomatoes, so I only used organic zucchinis. I sautéed them on high less than 8 minutes, probably 3 minutes per side, because I was afraid they would turn "mushy". The fresh basil complements and gives this dish a really nice flavor. Thanks Phil!

Loved this recipe but I made a few changes that made it superb. I layered flat in the casserole dish, two layers in order zuchini, tomato, mozz. I added a quarter of a bulb fresh minced garlic and over the top before I baked I added fresh juice drizzle from almost a whole lemon and I used a good amount of fresh basil. I cooked uncovered on top rack (very important ro remember in my opinion). The fresh parmesan over the top sealed the deal. I cooked mine at 375 (tippy top rack) for around 40 min. checking ever so often and let rest 5 min before serving. I highly recommend taking the time to properly crisp your zucchini. My dish wasnt mush everything was perfect. Good crusty bread is a MUST for this dish. 10/10 will make again.

Delicious but somewhat time consuming frying the zucchini. Next time I will make thinner slices so as not to have to cook so long.

I put the salt and the basil on when I slice them before I put them in the casserole dish so it would flavor each piece used more basil.  then the recipe  great recipe if you're trying to eliminate carbs and meat!

FABulous even without any mozzarella (which I didn't have). I didn't sautee the zucchini first; I greased the baking dish with EVOO and layered the raw zucchini on the bottom, then the tomatoes and topping, and the zucchini cooked exactly how I like it this way. Yummy!! Thanks.

So good.  Sauteed the zucchini with garlic powder (instead of fresh garlic), added italian-seasoned bread crumbs during baking.  Also, removed the seeds from the tomato before adding to recipe and the end product was not soggy at all.  Great, fresh, light flavor!
