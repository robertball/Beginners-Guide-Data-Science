"A little bit of this and a little bit of that," has never helped when it came to Hot Water Cornbread, and is the only recipe my mom could give me. I tried this one (with a little modification) and it turned out great. The thing to remember is that the boiling water already cooks the cornmeal, so you don't have to fry it that long - just long enough for it to get LIGHT brown on each side. If you add sugar, you'll need to watch it extra carefully because the sugar will cause the cornbread to burn if the heat is real high. I'm not a pro and can prepare this without measuring!

This recipe was pretty good.Really easy and really quick. The only thing that was dissapointing is that the recipe says you can make 12 cakes. They would have to be really small cakes. I usually get about 5-6 but with the bigger size you'll have to fry them a little longer. I also altered the recipe a little by taking the salt out completely and doubling the sugar. This give the bread a sweeter taste. I found it to be too salty with the original for my own taste.

Quick and easy. These would go well with ham or fried fish or chicken as well as being a quick hot breakfast.

The first batch I made, I forgot to add the shortening and they turned out just as good as the second batch with the shortening, so I'll be omitting the shortening from now on.
They are a bit too salty, but cutting the salt in half makes them too bland for eating without syrup. Next time I'll try 3/4 teaspoon salt.

I couldn't form little flatten balls, so I just dropped the batter by heaping spoonfuls onto a well-oiled skillet (I found that an eighth inch of oil worked as well as a half inch)

They cook quickly and also burn quickly, so keep a close eye on the frying process.

This is a wonderful recipe.  When I told my mom I found this recipe (she is 83 and a great cook)she said it was exactly right, except I needed to add 1 tbs of finely minced onion to make it authenic!  I did and it was wonderful.  Served with honey butter - also from this web site - and large lima beans cooked with bits of baked ham.  Try it, if you love country cooking, you will love it!  Thanks, Karin.

Yummy!  I am on a special diet (Daniel's fast) where I cannot eat many of the things you would normally put in breads so I was excited to find this recipe. I modified this to omit the sugar and shortening and cooked in olive oil.  I dipped it in honey and it was very delicious - my whole family loved it!  I agree with other reviewer that there is no difference with or without shortening so you might as well save the fat (I did try both ways).  I also tried cooking the cornbread in 1/2" canola oil the first time and 1/8" olive the second time I made it and it tasted the same so again you can save calories. I will use this recipe over and over again - thanks!

I got the recipe. I have been looking for a long time for one that tasted like the one my grandmother fixed. It was GREAT!. After we had eaten I happened to look at the cornmeal I was using and it was Aunt Jemima self-rising yellow corn meal mix! I know that is not was what was called for but it was so good I will always fix it that way. Thanks for bringing back wonderful memories.

This recipe was extremely easy, however my family and I felt the amount of salt overwhelmed us.  Also, it only made about 6-3 inch cakes instead of 12-1 inch cakes.  Cut the salt, to 1/2 to 3/4 tsp, and possibly add some minced onion for flavor.  Also double the recipe if you are cooking for more than two people.

Growing up in East Texas, I was raised on this type of corn bread. The only changes that I have is add 1 cup of flour to the mix, and no sugar, but then again we eat them plain, no butter or syrup.

My mother, who has passed away, yesterday would have been her 78th birthday, was a wonderful cook.  I was thinking about her and the life she had growing up in Thornton, TX.  They were very poor and life was hard for her.  She eventually moved to the big city, married and divorced.  As she was a single mother, she loved to fix the foods she grew up eating.  One of those was Hot Water Fried Corn Bread.  Even though I didn't grow up in the country, I had the benefit of eating those foods.  I could not remember exactly how she made this and thru Wikipedia, read about Hot Water Corn Bread and here I am.  I guess there are two versions to this recipe:  One savory and one sweet.  We never ate the sweet one.  My mother usually fixed this with fried potatoes, greens and either pinto beans, Giant butter beans, black-eyed peas etc...There were several different types of beans, depending on what was available or her mood.  We also would have fresh cut tomatoes, green onions or a vegetable salad.  The crispier and browner she'd fry these, the better I liked it and I can't wait to try these out with some black-eyed peas and ham hocks I hear calling my name.  Thanks for posting this recipe for some really good Texas Soul Food memories.  YUM.

EXCELLENT!  I can't say enough good things about this super simple recipe.  I used yellow corn meal, which I think has more flavor.  Really good with a "country" meal without the syrup.

This is one of the best Hot Water Cornbread recipes i've come across. The sweetness of the sugar is perfect as well as the salt. I've also added just a teaspoon of flour to the batter after it cools a bit, this gives it a little extra texture after cooking. Since i enjoy alittle spice in alot of my cooking i'll add minced onion, jalapeno and one half cup of drained Whole Kernal Corn to half the batter, its great.

This is a wonderful recipe. I did add self-rising flour 1/4 cup, cut salt to 1/2 tsp. also for everyones benefit if you wet your hands prior to rolling your patties out or corn balls they will not stick to your hands. I also used cocoanut  oil for frying. Suppose to be healthier for you.

This recipe is similar to how my mother used to make them, minus the sugar.  However, I the ladies at church whip up a batch and they just used self-rising white cornbread and added hot water to it until it was the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Then, she dropped spoonfuls in deep fat.  They looked more like hush puppies than pancakes, and they were delicious.  No need for butter, honey, or anything else.  Wonderful with collard greens.

Good recipe. We had it as a side to a bowl of simple brown rice and kidney beans. Because of previous reviews i decided to increse the serving size to more then i needed. I increased it to 20 and i ended up with 16. It would not form "little cakes" so i just dropped it in the oil right off a spoon. I was also out of salt so i just used the sugar and i spread salted butter on the top, and they came out very good. Even my little sister who will eat almost nothing except pizza liked them! Oh and i used butter instead of shortening.

Memories of my grandmother when I reduce the sugar to half teaspoon and add about a half tsp pepper.  Absolutely delicious.

Was looking for a recipe that tasted like what my grandparents used to make.  This was pretty good, but a little sweet.  I used white corn meal and I cut the salt in half and threw in a pinch of baking powder (maybe 1/2 teaspoon)  I used bacon grease for the shortning and to fry them in because that's what my grandparents did.  This is probably as close as I will come but I'm going to adds a little flour and see how that tastes. My grandma's looked almost like english muffins.

This is my base recipe for hot water cornbread. Love the recipe only I don't use sugar. Took tip from other reviewer after first batch and cut back salt by half and they came out perfect. Excellent with some fresh greens or sauteed squash. Thanks for sharing.

This is the same recipe my grandma used minus the sugar. Use stone ground white corn meal medium ground is my preference. Great with greens or split then stew on top. Same recipe but drop into boiling pot of greens for a few minutes makes great corn bread dumplings! Mm mmm I can see my grand ma making these as I write. Also goes with pulled pork spit and made as sandwich.

I grew up eating hot water corn bread made from white corn flour (specifically Adams medium stone ground white cornmeal :-). Because I could only find this "meal"at stores in the south, I was desperate to find an alternate recipe. I have to agree with the other users who found this recipe too salty.  Reduce the amount of salt in the recipe to 1/4 to 3/4 teaspoon  to taste.  Otherwise it is a very easy recipe and should be doubled if you are serving more than three people.

Quick, Simple, Versatile, Delicious. Great sweet or savory. Compliments any meal. Suggestion: much easier when rolled into balls or cakes prior to cooking. Also, easier to remove cake              from palm with back of a spoon slipped under edge of cake

Made this recipe to a T and after I fried the first few they were so flat and bland. I ended up adding some baking powder which made them fluff a bit more and I should have added something to adjust the flavor. I don't think I will ever make these again as no one really ate them well. Maybe I had higher expectations for this recipe.

This is one version of Hot Water Cornbread. I was taught to just buy a cornmeal mix, add boiling water, until just mixed and fry in a little grease. It works just as well.

I modified the recipe and used Tony's Seasoning instead of salt and butter instead of shorting and I fried them in bacon grease in a black iron skillet. These are the best!

You have an awesome recipe, that is easily modified to a person's healthy diet (ie, no salt) or taste (ie, sweet or no sweet.).

Thank you for taking the time to post this. I appreciate you. :)

Our family has eaten Hot Water Cornbread for years.  My Mom calls it Five Finger Cornbread because you can see your fingers after making the patties.  Love it with butter and syrup.

We liked these but they are a bit bland. I put salt on them after cooking to give some flavor.

Just tried it! Reminds me of the fried corn bread my mom used to make. We do not put syrup on them though, we slice length wise and spread a little butter on them . Came out very tasty! Next time I might try chopped onion and some chopped chili's.

Out of 8 people, 6 loved it, one said it was ok, and one did not like it. I liked it, but it was a little bit too salty. I fried it in bacon grease, so I think that upped the salt a little bit. I was wanting a recipe that duplicated one my grandmother use to make, this is not it, but close. I will add some garlic and onion powder, and maybe some other things and try again. Good base recipe, adjust to your taste!!

Simple and easy. Perhaps not the most nutritious way to prepare cornbread, but everyone ( 4 to 82 years old) at the table devoured it. Brings back memories.  Goes great with red beans and rice and sliced raw onion. Thank you for the "blast from the past" recipe!

I love hotwater cornbread!  The first time I made it was with my father about 5-6 years ago.  I wanted to follow the recipe but I did not have any shortening.  So I used 2 TBSP of Butter instead, came out perfect.  I made green beans and smoked turkey with my slow cooker, my dinner was yum.  Check out my reviews for Slow cooker green beans.  Try them with the hotwater cornbread!

I made these tonight using butter instead of shortening. If you use salted butter, you may want to cut out or severely decrease the salt. They were the consistency and basic taste that I wanted, but just too salty. I'll be making these again soon.

These were amazing, both plain and with onions.  I caramelized some diced onion in the vegetable shortening and added that to the dough. Next time I will try bacon fat.

made this for supper tonight and served it with great northern beans-- I was a little leary since it doesn't have any eggs. After reading a few reviews, decided to add a little flour, also omitted the salt and also the sugar because we don't like sweet cornbread. All in all, it was good-- I had to add a little more water than the recipe called for, but it was good--would recommend it for a change!

These corncakes are very yummy.  I like the level of salt-flavor, but I would like them a little sweeter, so next time I'll add more sugar.  

I did fry them too long.  By the time they're really golden, they're too crispy on the outside to cut easily.  I can't wait to make them again and not overcook them.  They are delicious and I love the taste of them with real maple syrup!

Truly tasteless, but then I don't have bacon grease which I'm sure would solve that problem. Also, everyone who says it's too salty with one tsp of salt is SO right. And I am a TRUE saltaholic!

This is how I make my hot water corn bread,some times I dice up onion and green bell peppers and put into the water. My family loves this corn bread on the side with turnip greens, mustard greens and collard greens. It's even good with strawberry jam and preserves on top as a snack. I am an old Southern cook and this recipe is just like my grandma cooked. A+

Very simple and quick! I used organic coconut oil instead of shortening and also fried it in coconut oil.  I used celtic sea salt instead of regular salt. Turned out delicious! !

Simply the best! I have never had a hot water cornbread recipe that I would use more than once. This recipe has become the one for me, finally. I made adjustments to suit my taste. Reduced hot water by 2 tablespoons, thus adding 2 tablespoons of coconut milk, used corn oil instead of shortening, also slightly increased corn meal. I am happy!!!!!!!!!

Much too salty...I tried it again substituting salted butter for the shortening, and omitting the salt...much better.

Very good cornbread. Easy to prepare and does not take long to cook.

I used olive oil the first two times and vegetable oil the last time. Olive oil tasted better to me, but as a novice cook I found the oil had a more narrow cooking temperature range because it would spike in temp pretty quickly if not carefull.  I stood over it and the first pop took it off the eye and turned the eye off and it got even hotter it seemed. Splattered everywhere.

With the vegetable oil I never had that even begin to get too hot.  I think olive oil has a lower flashpoint and as a result a much norrower cooking range for the cornbread.

I used a hand  milled locally purchased cornmeal...fantastic texture.  Used shortening and bacon grease, I think it really did something good for the flavor.  Topped it with a dab of real butter and some local, organic buckwheat honey.  OMG it was so good!  Hubby kept asking for more!

I made this the first time just like the recipe said and it was way too salty, but if you cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp if your surving it with something salty or 3/4 tsp if you are serving it with maple syrup it works out great.

not really what i was expecting.  the cornmeal didnt cook very well with the boiling water so the texture was grainy and the cornbread cakes themselves were incredibly bland.  there are a number of changes I would make - including working in some leavening agents and some flour to give it a lighter fexgture.  i'd also probably use instant grits instead of actual corn meal to hopefully remedy the texture flaws. Other than that I'd probably spray them with some butter or oil and bake them instead - the frying is just unnecessary calories. :(

I found this recipe when I needed a bread to have with dinner, but didn't have much on hand.  This recipe saved the day!  I've never had cornbread "fried".  Hubby & kids all thought is was absolutely wonderful!  We ate it with butter, but the kids had to try it with butter and syrup.  WOW!  I just can't say enough how wonderful this tastes for such a simple recipe.

I thought this was pretty good. I had never eaten this type of cornbread before so wasn't sure how it should taste. The people I served it to were dying to taste some because their Mom had always made it for them as children and they loved it. They thought it was good but just not as fluffy as their childhood version their Mom made.

Tastes just like my grandpa’s hot water cornbread! Easy and delicious. I’ve used bacon grease or butter in lieu of shortening and both times they turned out great. The frying process is easy and consistent in my cast iron pan. I served them with black-eyed peas and collard greens. Thanks for the very simple and delicious recipe!

Quick and easy, reminded me of hush puppies. I fried them in only 1/8 inch of oil and they were fine. My husband liked them and said they reminded him of corn cakes he had as a child in Indiana. Kids thought they were ok. Made 10 or 11, served with maple syrup and honey on the side.

I followed all ingredients,  however, I tried it in an air fryer. Not sure  how thin they are supposed to be they turned out VERY crispy as I sprayed pam on both sides instead of frying in oil. Set air fryer at 400 degrees and cooked 5 minutes each side. With this recipe I made 8 medallion sized out of one batch.

Great recipe but why is it called hot water corn bread when it's cooked in fatty old cooking oil?

I have no idea how you got these to form into balls. I followed the instructions (except I substituted butter for lard), and it was just too grainy to make into balls. Ended up adding about 1/2 c. of flour, one egg, and a TSP of baking powder, and they turned out quite good. Tasty! 

Maybe the original recipe used self-raising cornmeal?? That kind is uncommon in my part of Canada.

I make this quite often actually.  Sometimes,  for a twist, I add cut up pieces of okra to the batter.  My family really enjoys it.

Crunchy on the outside soft deliciousness on the inside. I did add more sugar just because I like my cornbread sweet like the personality I have in my head. Thanks for this easy recipe , an option for summer when it’s to dam hot for the oven.

I loved this recipe! It tastes like my grandmas. I used masa corn flour instead of cornmeal and I used butter instead of shortening and everything was perfect. I didn't find that it was too salty like some people said...I thought the saltiness made it great to eat plain. I also doubled the recipe  in order to make 12 pieces.

Probably better if a little flower added, plus a little less cooking time so they don't get too hard, but it is a quick easy solution to "need it right now " cornbread.  Will definitely use it again.

Used bacon drippings instead of shortening, added 1/2 tsp baking powder and eliminated the sugar.  Turned out perfectly.  Can't imagine eating it with maple syrup, but the corn pone is great with veggies.

I really like this recipie for its simplicity and versatility.  I find it more of a base though, but it is good on its own.  I don't use the amount of salt (1/2) but I will add other things like poultry or pork seasoning, or cinnamon or fresh parsley or apple sauce - depending on what I am having with it.  On its own with syrup or gravy is fine, but blended into a meal much better!

Easy recipe I used butter instead of shortening and added a couple splashes of vanilla.  I may double the recipe and use an ice cream scooper for larger cakes or add fried apples for a fritter.

I will not lie, I think the salt was the only thing I changed. I made a double batch and they turned out perfect. I have never made hot water cornbread but I love it. This is a wonderful recipe for anyone.

My rating on this is no reflection on this recipe. My family would not like the added Ingredients. . My post here is a version of this. My husband's family has been making this version  for years. We only use stone ground mill cornmeal. This makes a huge difference. Easier to find in small towns in the south.  We put whatever amount we're going to make in a large flatter type soup bowl. We measure salt by topping the top of the mound with salt(like a snow top mountain). We add enough water so it's between thick and thin. Cover bottom of frying pan with oil and drop by tablespoon. If you like your cornbread crunchier then make the batter a little thinner. My husband would neve want sugar in his fried cornbread. Whenever I make this no one has ever seen it but everyone loves it.

The amount of water listed was too much.  It made the batter to liquidity and I couldn't form into balls.  They came out flatter than I would have liked, but they tasted good.  Half of them also fell apart pretty bad.

I made the following changes:  add a little flour and use equal amounts of self-rising meal and you do not have to worry about the salt; my mother would wait until the batter cooled and added an egg with a little sugar; fried the batter in bacon fat.  Just keep practicing u till you get it the way you want them.

I didn't use cornbread mix. I used plain corn meal   Cornbread mix has salt and flour in it.  I also cut back on the water just a little and use milk. It helps it brown when not using sugar. I also add bacon grease to fry it in as it gives it the flavor I was used to growing up.  My mother in law used to fry these in bacon grease only.  She would butter them the minute they come out of the skillet and let the butter melt on the hot cornbread.  Delicious.

I loved that I could serve my daughter with an egg allergy cornbread but it came out too crispy for our taste.  Maybe I cooked it too long but otherwise not too bad with some pinto beans.

Our family loves Hot Water Corn Bread plain with soups instead of crackers. It's delicious. Never made it with sugar or ate them with syrup. We eat fried grits (what my mother called Fried Mush) with syrup so that would be about the same flavors. Very good. She put left over grits in a square tupperware container and refrigerated. When set she would slice them and fry in butter and drizzle syrup on them.  Both being made from corn would have the same delicious flavors..will have to try sometime if we ever have any left over.

Pretty good. I read others reviews and only used 1/2 teaspoon salt and about 1 1/2 teaspoon sugar. I didn't use  1/2 inch oil ...i used less and after i removed them from the oil and  let them set for about 2 minutes...i drizzled  them with honey...so good...it didn't make 12 "cakes"...just 9 really small ones...

This is good and easy.  To make this though I must be in the mood to deal wtih leftover oil.  I added a dash more salt because I didn't intend on eating with honey or syrup - just plain.

Great recipe! I think I used polenta (on hand) instead of corn meal. I also cut the salt and doubled the sugar. I didn't use oil to fry it in, but vegetable spray. It fell apart but for my first try, it tasted great!

I wasn't a fan of these little cakes, but my husband and son really liked them.  (I thought the cakes were somewhat bland.)  My son is allergic to dairy and eggs, so this was a great recipe for him!
