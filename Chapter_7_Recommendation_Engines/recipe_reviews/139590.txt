I tried this recipe because my boyfriend is diabetic. I didn't think it would taste like hot chocolate made with sugar but it was really good and I only used 1 cup of splenda. It is hard to find diabetic recipes for things that we used to enjoy. Thanks.

the only changes I made was to use "stevia in the raw" instead of splenda since my mum has a bad reaction to that and I did add a 4 serving box of instant sugar free pudding mix. I brought in a canister of this and regular hot chocolate mix to work and the sugar free went faster than the regular. I also left out inexpensive cinnamon sticks from the dollar store and sugar free candy canes to stir with. Fantastic recipe!

I made this recipe.And I am very happy with the taste.I used Coffee Mate brand creamer~Splenda Sugar Blend granulated~Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate unsweetened Cocoa.It is not thick consistancy like major brand.But, to consider taste and calories.I would make this again.Chocolate looks dark like mud..LOL But, dark cocoa makes the difference.

I used Coffeemate sugar free french vanilla dry creamer (you can get this at most any grocery store) and bulk non-fat milk powder. This was better than I thought, very creamy. I think I'd like to play with it a little and maybe try to find the dark chocolate cocoa powder another reviewer talked about. This was a heck of a lot cheaper than buying the little packets of the name brand sugar free cocoa....I was paying almost 5 bucks for six packets! This'll be nice to give out at Christmas to my group of girlfriends who all watch their weight.

I made it as directed using the Hersheys Dark Cocoa and it is great ! After drinking half a cup, I remembered I had some hazelnut liquid creamer and that put it right over the top for me! Thanks for a great no sugar recipe that makes me feel like I am cheating..

I thought this was a nice recipe. I was concerned at 1st about the over all use of Splenda being so much. But after I mixed it up and then made me a cup, being that a standard packet suggests around 6 ounces of water. So taking in that the recipe is or says 24 servings, if you do the 2 tbsp of mix, you can work the batch out to about 34 servings. I didn't find the mix at all sweet to the point that it was excessive. It was rather mild. So I can justify the splenda ratio to the recipe. It really really wasn't overly sweet at all and that's what the marshmellows are for ;-) TY, this is a recipe I can see about keeping on hand for myself.

Very tasty; much better than I anticipated.  I didn't have any of the ingredients in the pantry so the initial cost was pretty high, but I'll be making this often so it will even out.  Next time I'll add some instant coffee crystals to the mix for mocha.

I've adjusted the ingredients to fit my palate better and love it! For 36 servings which fit into my processor perfectly, I use
2c. stevia powder
2c. powdered creamer
1 3/4 c. powdered milk
1c +2T. dark cocoa.
Not too sweet, creamy enough, milky enough, and best of all Dark!

I made this tonight...New Year's Eve. It's good. Needs more powdered milk and SPLENDA. It makes 4 1/2 cups of dry mix. And only 2 points-plus per 4T to 8 oz water for weight watchers. Increasing the ingredients would up the points value.

I followed directions and put the mix through a food processor and it helped to keep it from settling in the bottom of the cup and to mix up easier with the hot water. Thank You for that suggestion.

Made this for my mom, who is counting calories and carbs.  I used fat free non-dairy creamer and non fat dry milk because that's what I had at home.  I put it in a pretty jar for my mom, but had some left over which I used to make a mug for my husband and myself.  It was creamy unlike regular instant hot cocoa made with water, but we found that we had to continuously mix it.  It's a fair trade for this low calorie/low carb treat.  UPDATE:  Mixed up a hot mug of this and added a generous amount of whipped cream vodka--it was absolutely wonderful and lower in carbs and calories than most alcoholic beverages!

I was rather dissapointed in this. The amount of Splenda seemed rather excessive and to buy the ingredients costs a bit of money compared to just buying a box of sugar free cocoa at the store. I changed the servings to 4, with the calculate button, and had to open 30 Splenda packets to get the amount specified! That comes out to 7.5 packets a serving! Maybe, the store packets have that much to, I don't know. To make a low sugar hot cocoa I normally just mix a little cocoa, a drop of vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon, a packet of Truvia and stir into some hot milk or milk/water combination. It is so easy! I thought having a mix on hand would be more handy. However, it took too long to mix up and I am worried about drinking a cup of cocoa with so much artificial sweetener. At first sip, it wasn't actually bad, but then I was left with the flavor of nothing but splenda on my taste buds!

I make large batches of this and keep it on the counter.  I use it to "mocha" my coffee in the morning.  I have tried various artificial sweeteners but have settled on half Splenda/suger combination.

Did not care for this at all.  AS THE RECIPE IS, would not make again without some sort of adjustment.  Too much taste of the dry milk, not enough cocoa and I do not like things super sweet so I used about 1tsp of splenda (4 packs).  Again, AS IS, no good, if I would like to make adjustments I would do so and write my own recipe, just wanted something simple that tasted good but not super sweet.  Hunt continues...

Made a huge batch of this over a year ago and stored in a large Tupperware canister.  Am now running out and have to make another batch.  It is costly to buy the ingredients but it makes such a large quantity.  I also make it with dark chocolate cocoa powder, though I use a free-trade, non-GMO product.  My favorite thing to use it for, other than a wonderful cup of hot cocoa, is to put a scoop in a small mason jar, along with 2 TBSP of Chia seeds and 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk for chocolate-chia seed pudding.  So Yum!  I would give this recipe 10 stars (or a 100) if it were an option.

i think it tastes to much like powdered milk for the amount of money spent making it.  i went with 2/3 cups of dry milk and 1 1/3 cups creamer and 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of special dark cocoa and it makes a screaming good cup of hot cocoa.

This mix was too thin and watery for my taste using it in water, but the next time I added it to milk and it was creamier and much better. I like that it uses Splenda instead of sugar, making for a lighter hot cocoa.

Just a little too sweet for my taste so I'll cut back on the splenda next time.  I used sugar free Vanilla Caramel coffee mate instead of regular or French vanilla. Love the taste. Next time I will try mixing in sugar free chocolate pudding. I also mixed this in the food processor and I think this makes a difference.

Used Hershey's dark cocoa powder and replaced Splenda with an 1/8 cup plus 1  Tbsp Nustevia brand stevia powder because i don't tolerate artificial sweeteners well.  Added a tbsp    of light cream to the hot chocolate. Outstanding!!  Just what I was hoping for!!  Thanks!!

I followed the recipe to the T. It was ok. I like my hot cocoa to be really chocolaty. This recipe tasted more like the dry milk that it called for.
