This was my mom's "special" pie growing up. We all loved it and it was fancy enough to bring to dinner parties.

This looks exactly like the pie recipe my Mom has from my Grandmother. It's tradition in our family to make a pumpkin pie and Colonial Innkeeper's for our Thanksgiving dinner. It has a wonderful almost cakey texture. The chocolate on top should sink to the bottom of the pie a suprise layer of rich chocolate. It's superb with a dollop of whipped cream on top of it.

Absolutely wonderful. I actually used 2 ounces of chocolate instead of 1 1/2 (there was a small incident...) and it still turned out beautifully. I think part of what made it great was the mystery of whether it would turn out like a cake a custard a pie or what.

I have made this pie for years as it was my husband's favorite growing up. All the recipes I find are exactly like this and all call for 9 inch pie crust. The only way I have made this successfully is to use a 10 inch deep dish plate. Otherwise it spills over.

I did not care for this recipe AT ALL. More like cake. The batter spilled over on both pies and made a mess.

Very tasty. Will definitely make it again. I used the recipe for Aunt Ruth's pie crust (best recipe I have ever found for pie crust) and it was perfect for this pie. I had to cook it a little longer than 60 minutes but it was gooey and warm and chocolatey tastiness!

I really like this pie/cake. So different than other pies.  I like to pre-bake the crust and use vanilla/bourbon extract for a little flavor kick. Great with ice cream or whipped cream.
