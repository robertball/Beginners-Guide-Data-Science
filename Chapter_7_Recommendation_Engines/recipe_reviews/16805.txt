Made this tonight and everyone liked it. I did make a few adjustments. Added 1/8 tsp of garlic powder and a bit of freshly ground pepper. I used pretty large chix breast and baked uncovered for 30 minutes at 375F.  This was way enough baking time. Next time, I'll only bake for 25 minutes. Thanks, Mike!

I do something like this but I like to use thyme, basil, oregano(depending on what I'm in the mood for) either with or w/o the poultry seasoning and put the mayo mixture and chicken in a ziploc bag and leave it overnight. Then roll in finely crushed potato chip crumbs. I definitely uncover for last 20-30 mins for crispiness.

This is a great recipe idea. I had the chicken strips sit in the Mayo for a few hours before cooking. I also just used Tarragon for seasoning and crushed potatoe chips for the coating. I loved it and so did everyone else! I'll be making it again very soon!

This recipe was really excellent!  At first I thought the mayo would not taste very good but I was diffently wrong, my entire family loved the chicken.  I added a bit of red chile to the seasoning which gave it a little kick, I was extremely satisfied.

this sounds good but are you sure on the cooking time?  it seems like a very long time to cook chicken breast.

This is great but needs more seasoning I felt so maybe add a touch more.  I used cornflakes and just put them in the blend and pressed grind and it was such a simple recipe and everyone ate it up! Good food for everyone! I baked at 375 for 25 minutes uncovered and it turned out moist and very good.
