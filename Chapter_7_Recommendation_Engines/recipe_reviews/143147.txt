I changed this just a bit, to add more flavor. I sauteed the red bell pepper with the garlic (which I added more of) and some chopped onion in a little evoo/butter before adding the condensed soup, water, tomato juice (I used V-8), the spices and tomato. To make it creamy without too much fat, I added a quarter cup of fat free evaporated milk. This was a nice tomato soup, perfectly spiced. The only issue I had was that I would have liked more tomatoes and tomato flavor. Next time, I'll use either less water and more tomato juice and I'll add more diced tomatoes. NOTE: This makes more than four servings, unless you have really happy soup eaters. More like six healthy servings.

My husband and I love tomato soup, and this was a nice change from the usual that I make.  We love a smooth texture, so I pureed the peppers and diced tomatoes before adding, and it was wonderful.  I will make this one again.

We love this soup!!  This is a family favourite, and have made it as written here and at times we have modified it a bit too.  Definitely roast the peppers

I didn't have any chives, and used garlic powder instead of fresh, as well as canned diced tomatoes. I counted the juice of the canned tomatoes as enough "tomato juice." Yummy spices, nice with the red pepper.

I used milk instead of the water, as always do with condensed tomato soup.  I also halved the spices, and still found the spices to over power the tomato flavor.  If you like a spicy tomato soup, then maybe this is recipe is for you.  For me, when I have tomato soup, I like to taste the tomato, and have it be the predominant flavor.  We all ate it with our grilled mozzarella paninis, but it's probably not a recipe that I'd make again.
