this is very good and so easy.  I used a candy thermometer, and even cooking slowly on a medium heat, it didn't take as long as stated to reach the soft ball stage.  I did sub out some of the pretzels for peanut butter chex cereal I had that I wanted to use up.  It was a nice variation.  I always stir my peanuts in with the sauce after it has cooked, with the baking soda.  That way, the peanuts seem to adhere to the other ingredients, and aren't straggling around at the bottom of the bowl.  The candy corn and M&Ms made it very festive!

This was such a great Halloween party snack for a party I attended. Everyone loved it and the bowl was gone when I left. I followed the recipe exactly but did not cookout caramel sauce anywhere near 18-20 min. It was more like 10min in total. Thanks for sharing!
