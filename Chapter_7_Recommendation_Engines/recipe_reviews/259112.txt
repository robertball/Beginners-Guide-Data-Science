Let me say much better than that watery stuff you buy in the jar.  The only thing I did different was I used brown sugar (because I prefer the caramel taste of brown sugar to white when mixed with vinegar) - and it was perfect!  Everyone loved it.

I made it but without the sugar and butter. Added brown sugar in the simmering stage to offset apple cider ginger. Also started with bacon , browned it, removed then simmered onion in that. Later I added bacon crushed  delicious

Turned out tasty- used some boiled cider to kick up the apple flavor. It was cleansing used as a side to Mac and cheese. Perfect.

I used Chopped Leek instead of onions, also added chopped Red and Yellow Pepper for extra color.  Also used coconut oil.  It was yummy!  Great to know different recipe for red cabbage.
