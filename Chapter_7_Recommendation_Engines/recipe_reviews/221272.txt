Only 2 reviews? Don't worry about that take my word for it. This is SO good! I've made it twice already and it is a hit! I changed a couple of things but basically stuck to the plan. I did not use the the Dijon or parsley, not needed. I did it the same except instead of cooking on the stove for 25 mins, I baked it in a covered enameled cast iron Dutch oven. I saute'd the sausages, then onions & I added a shallot with the garlic saute. Layered it with sausages & potatoes on bottom, then cabbage on top. Baked for about 45 mins covered at 375*. I thickened it before serving with whole grain organic baby rice cereal while on stove. No gluten!

I read the reviews, and I have to disagree. I know this is Chef John, but this was a huge disappointment. I followed this recipe to the letter, and what I ended up with tasted like meat and potatoes boiled with cabbage and water. I expected some apple flavor using the apple chicken sausage and cooking it in apple juice. The apple flavor was nonexistent, and the sausage was tough (the texture really changed), burst open (not good for presentation), and I did simmer on a low temperature. It was so bland that near the end I added some caraway seeds, more salt and pepper, and we actually used cider vinegar at the table to add some flavor. If I were to make this again, I would use more onion, and add fresh apples to the cabbage.  Since the sausages picked up no flavor from the apple juice and were totally cooked anyway, I'd most likely not simmer them with the cabbage and just add in toward the end to reheat (they looked great after browning). Sorry Chef John, this is just my opinion, but I did not consider this one of your best efforts. Doubtful I'll make again, too many tweaks to make this work for us.

I give it 5 stars because I had to modify with purple cabbage & regular potatoes instead of green & yukons.  Followed the recipe as exact as I could otherwise.  Cut the potatoes into 1/8ths.

This is so yummy! I used spicy and sweet sausage 8 links total. I also added 3 Granny Smith apples peeled and chopped in big chunks. Excellent.

This was a wonderful Fall recipe!  I used regular potatoes (didn't have the Yukons) peeled and cut and simmered with apple cider.  It was easy to cut shreds of cabbage from the head and it tasted great, much better than a similar recipe using sauerkraut.  After reading other reviews, it seems some have misread the recipe, using apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider.  Yikes, no wonder they did not like the strong vinegar taste.  There is no vinegar called for in this recipe.  I recommend they try it again, but with apple cider this time, and believe they will really enjoy it!

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's such a good base recipe and so easy to tweak.  I had all of the ingredients in the house...almost.  Actually, used venison sausage which was quite bland so I needed more salt and lots of pepper.  Only had 2 cups apple juice which is more than enough, and I think vegetable or chicken broth would be just fine.  Perhaps throw in a cored, peeled and chunked apple or two. And it's better the next day.

I found some Chicken Apple Sausage in the freezer, and I decided to give this recipe a try.  I like all the ingredients, but I didn't like them together.  The sausage tasted fine, and the cabbage cooked in apple juice was different.  If you know someone who doesn't like cabbage, they might be OK with this, because it really doesn't have a cabbage flavor, just a  sweet flavor, yet not apple-y.  However, the Yukon Golds cooked in apple juice didn't make the cut.  I want potatoes to taste like potatoes, and I found the sweet flavor imparted by the apple juice to be unsettling.  I probably won't make this recipe again.  This review isn't a "Dear John" letter, but it isn't a love letter, either.

I did make some changes. As I didnt have enough potatoes I added some chopped apples... and when I started I thought I had apple juice in the fridge which turned out to be fruit punch (yuck).  Instead of apple juice I used white wine. I think the sausage I used is the BEST tasting sausage(Aidells's). As a result of the changes, It was bursting with flavors!  It was incredible.  Even my toddlers had a few bites.  I will absolutely make it again.  In fact, my husband just purchased some sausage specifically for this recipe.  :)

Have you ever read through something so fast, you screwed up royally?  I thought this recipe called for 3 cups of apple cider vinegar, and so our meal was a tad on the tart side, nigh to inedible.  Now, I did stop to think "wow, that's a lot of vinegar!" but then of course said "You've never made this dish before, so don't judge before you've done it the traditional way."... Anyways, when the smell clears out of our house, we'll try it again.  It seems like it would have been really delicious,  done right.

I've been in a food rut lately and wanted to try something different. Made this exactly per the recipe, but used hard apple cider instead of regular. Divided it into individual bowls with just a bit of mustard to mix in. Fantastic! Will make again soon!

Tried this tonight for supper. Unfortunately I found it waaaaaay too acidic--because I used 2 cups vinegar & 1 cup juice. I used a sweet onion and caramelized the heck out of them. Even with extra potatoes, the acid was just too much. I ended up adding sugar to save the dish, and I never cook with sugar.  To try to get it to mellow out I cooked it on the stove for twice the time recommended and the sausage split.  I recommend cutting this recipe with some chicken stock. One of the reviewers used sweet potatoes which doesn't seem like a half bad idea.

Thank you Chef John for another stellar recipe...I followed the ingredients and directions to a “T”.....up to #3. After that I put the potatoes, pan cooked ingredients into my cast iron Dutch oven. Poured in the apple juice, added two carrots and put the cabbage on the top of everything..then sprinkled caraway seeds over everything. Put it in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes. (From someone else’s suggestion..cuz I have a problem with not using my cast iron Dutch oven when I can)...The texture and flavors together are amazing...Serve with your favorite tart wine (Chardonnay, or German style beer) AMAZING.

I added 2 chopped apples and didn't have apple sausage so used bratwurst. I added some white wine to the apple juice and was great.  I probably would add more sausages as a lot of cabbage to meat.  But then again, i estimated the "1.5 lbs" so may have used more.  I also added a couple bay leaves. Delicious! I'm used to sauerkraut with sausage so this is a lightly sweet version of cabbage that is great!

I like chef John but I'm not in love with this recipe. Maybe if you replace half the apple cider with water or broth it would work better, otherwise it's too apple-y and sweet.

I used this recipe but had to make changes given what I had in the house. My chicken sausage was pre-cooked so I sliced & browned it and removed from pan. Then I added the onion/garlic & sliced 2 apples; I also did not add potatoes. Because of this (& I only had a small head of cabbage) I only added about 1-1.5 cups of cider. I also stirred in 1-2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard (the kind with mustard seeds) toward the end of cooking. I made this because I happened to have the ingredients to use up & it was one of the easiest recipes that I figured it couldn’t be that good & thought I would only give it 3 stars, but I was SHOCKED at how good this is! I WILL be making this again!!

Holy moly this is amazing! I did not change a thing. I used Trader Joes spiced cider & their chicken apple sausage. I made it earlier in the day and let it sit for hours after cooking it. The flavors are truly amazing together. Thanks Chef John!

Absolutely fantastic.  Use cider.  It's a heartier flavor.  I cooked mine in the oven in a cast-iron dutch oven.  Don't mess with the recipe.  It's perfect the way it is.

Love this. Super simple and delicious recipe. It’s made often at my house. I tend to be a bit generous with the apple cider and cabbage but that’s my personal preference.

Made this the other night with very  few changes.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used 1 cup of apple juice and 2 cups chicken broth.  I also sliced the sausage into small bites and did not remove from the pan.  I just let everything simmer until the cabbage was cooked down.
I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic! Especially the next day. I did add just a titch of sugar as it was in the final cook down phase. It is so good the second day, I would consider preparing  it the day before, the next time I make it.

Just added 2 peeled and chopped apples and adjusted the seasonings to our taste. Did add a little more apple cider before I reduced it at the end to intensify the apple flavor.
Do not use pre cooked sausages as they will dry out and won't have the rendered fat that you need to really brown the onions. 
Cooking is about reading the recipe correctly - always!
There is NO vinegar in this recipe so I disregarded any criticism made by people who used it. Enjoy

It has a good basis. Based on the reviews and my own concerns about flavor I changed it up. I did not do it in the Dutch oven but in a big stew pot.  I also added 1 lb of chicken and a pack of marinade for flavor. I used an herb and white wine mix but didn't add anything in addition to.the apple juice.  came out really well.

I really liked this dish. I think the Dijon mustard is a must! I ate half of my plate before remembering the mustard and I liked it so much better with it. My husband even liked it and he didn't even know it was healthier chicken apple sausage. It has a bit of sweetness but the salt, pepper & mustard really balanced it out nicely. Will make again for sure! Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Used sweet potatoes because I didn't have regular potatoes. Pretty tasty and a great use of all the cabbage I'm currently harvesting from our garden.

This recipe was wonderful. My boyfriend won't eat cooked cabbage so I shared this with my parents and they both loved it too. I'll make this in the future even if it's just for myself. 

One note: I didn't know what to do about garlic cloves because it didn't say so I used a garlic press and it would out great.

I added a couple of chopped Granny Smith apples with the potatoes.  We thought this was good and healthy comfort food.

This was a really tasty recipe and my husband and I both very much enjoyed it. I was looking for something a little different and it looked so good. 
I personally find chicken sausage just slightly wanting and am not sure how to get around that for this recipe. I’ll make it again though. Very good!

This dish was delicious!  I added red pepper to this and added them at the point I had to add the onions.  I was not able to reduce the broth, but I just served in bowls!  The Dijon on the top was absolutely a must to the garnish.  Just delicious and my family loved it!

I don't know yet - this is in the crock pot to put on first thing tomorrow. I am encouraged by some reviews, discouraged by others, but hopeful! I added about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, and half the apple juice. Also went ahead and added the mustard to the dish. I'll update after tomorrow....after I find a great loaf of rye to accompany it!

Has to be a 5 star recipe!  My 18yo son went back for his midnight snack and breakfast - and this was his choice!  I used 1# regular ground sausage and added a diced apple with the onion.  Didn't have apple juice/cider so subbed in 2-3T apple cider vinegar, 1c water, 1-2T sugar (less volume due to next comment).  I boiled my potatoes separately and added them at the end to ensure they'd be done when I wanted to serve.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly!  Anyone who added apple cider vinegar, disregard their rating.  I made this with apple juice  and it was fabulous.  I put dijon mustard and regular mustard on the table to serve with the dish.  It was mixed on who enjoyed the dijon, regular mustard, and none at all.

I will definitely make this again. A bit of work but everybody liked it. My husband rated it "frickin awesome". I used the dijon garnish on mine, he did not. I liked how the dijon balanced the sweetness of the apple. My 92-year old mother liked it too. And she can be rather picky. I used apple juice, not cider, since that's what I had. Also I used turkey apple sausage rather than chicken apple sausage since, again, that's what I had on hand. Either way it's a great recipe. I usually add more seasoning to most recipes than they call for but this one was perfect from the start. It had a LOT of apple flavor. Oh, I also cut the sausage into bite sized pieces.

This was absolutely awesome! I did add a cup of homemade apple sauce right before serving and we did use our homemade cider from last fall so that made it even better!  If you don't have these things, I would definitely err on the side of cider versus juice.  DELICIOUS!

This is a standby for my family!  We love that it's easy to make, delicious as left overs and everyone who tastes it loves it, too!  You can add cut up apples to it for some more texture and added apple flavor, too.

It was delicious and very different.  The addition of apple cider and onions with the cabbage made it delicious.  However, my small potatoes took longer to become tender than the recipe indicated. Oh, great leftover too.

We are not cabbage eaters, my 21 year old son saw the cabbage and said,  I'm not eating it.   however, he's now had his third serving.   made exactly as stated but added apples about 15 from the end of total cook time.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a great recipe for colder weather! Even though it takes time, it was super easy. The apple cider makes the cabbage and potatoes sweet, but not to sweet (which is good because the sausage is very sweet). It didn't look that pretty, but it was yummy!

I made this according to recipe and just as I suspected it was way to sweet for our taste.  So... Before serving I added Apple cider vinegar ... about 1/3 -1/2 cup. (I didn't measure.). This improved the taste and we sat down to dinner.  My husband and I ate, but we will not make again.

Used sweet Italian sausage, added two peeled and cored apples cut into large chunks (added layer of apples just before adding the cabbage).  I used only apple cider and added a teaspoon or so of chicken bullion paste to help flavor during the 5 minute boil down.  The mustard is a must (on the side to dip sausage into) as it adds great contrast.  Sweet, hardy, tangy........YUM!

When I went to make this I thought I had apple juice but it turned out I didn't  so I used all chicken broth - followed rest of receipe pretty much -  added an apple, and we loved it  I will definitely make it again only next time will double the sausage as we ended up with quite a bit of leftovers minus the sausage. I hadn't anticipated  this happening as we usually each eat only one of the sausages but we both ate two with this receipe! Will definitely make again!

This is one of a few recipes where I didn't try to out/over think the other cook. I WAS TOP DRAWER.

On the next go around (thats guaranteed) I will step up the seasoning some. I was timid, my fault.

So yummy, it tasted like the holidays!  Some of the issues  other cooks had might have been due to using vinegar instead of  cider, or using a different sausage than what the recipe called for.  So the reason I did't give this 5 stars is because I think the instructions need work.  When cooking timing is essential, potatoes always take longer to cook than cabbage, so cooking the potatoes  for 5 minutes before adding back in the sausage and then the cabbage is essential to not over cooking .

This is a great recipe and I will make it again; I did make some changes.  I used 3 cups of chicken broth (I didn't have apple juice), I added apples and I used a 16 oz bag of shredded cole slaw mix.  The chicken broth gave it a great flavor, next time I will do 2 c broth and 1 c apple juice.   I did #6, but nothing happened...it never thickened.  That's OK it was still great.  Thank you Chef John!

This recipe turned out great! Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making it again. I added an extra cup of the apple cider because the gold potatoes I found were medium in size rather then small and I wanted the liquid to just about cover them. Everything else was just as Chef John advised including cooking time. Next time I will add four more chicken Apple sausage links because there was room for them in the Dutch oven and the four I cooked were gone in minutes!

The sausage was good but if I make this again (which is doubtful), I would use chicken broth not apple juice. Too much of a sweet undertone for me.

This recipe was wonderful for a couple of reasons.  It is different from the norm, and it has some complex flavors. If you like sweet & savory, you will enjoy this meal. I bought high quality chicken sausage that had little fat which made this dish fairly healthy. My husband loved it and I look forward to making it again soon. It is also budget friendly.

I really enjoyed this.  I read other reviews about it being bland so I added more garlic. I wish I would have added more of the sausage, I have  lots of cabbage and potatoes left but no sausage. Maybe I added to much of the other stuff?

This recipe turned out very good.  My husband and I made it together and added fresh diced apple on the top after we plated it.  Yummy.  We also used the Apple cider which I think helped with the apple flavor.  We will be making this again.

I added a diced macintosh apple and substituted the yukon potatoes with mashed potatoes served alongside.   My husband and I liked this very much.  It had plenty of apple flavor and I think the mashed potatoes balanced the apple flavor perfectly.

Turned out fantastic
Used red cabbage instead of green, added two cut granny smith apples along with the cabbage, and finished cooking with a  splash of red wine vinegar

After reading the reviews, I doubled the sausage and cut into 1" slices and used diced red potatoes for ease of serving. Added 1 diced apple as recommended by other reviews. Made sure I used apple cider instead of apple juice. I found this recipe to be a bit sweet. I served with garlic bread to offset the sweetness. A nice meal for a cold and rainy day.

Made this last night to everyone's delight. Followed the instructions pretty much with the exceptions of added sausage (4 links more like 12).  I also added baby carrots for a more filling  and colorful plate. I don't have a busy web site so I shredded the cabbage,  peeling the potatoes slightly around the center was a great touch! My wife said add this one to your recipe box, done!

This was very good. I did take advise from others and added one Honey Crisp apple, sliced. I also used Chicken-Spinach Florentine Sausage from Coscto as my husband cannot have cheese and the apple chicken sausage has gouda. I also added an extra garlic clove. I will make this again

We loved it!!!  Will definitely make again. So easy!  Used regular smoked sausage, quality apple cider, and replaced a little cabbage with two large unpeeled Granny Smith apples.  Great sweet-tart flavor!  Stopped after simmering 25 minutes; remaining steps are unnecessary.

Just okay. It didn't say to cut up potatoes but I did out of fear it would take them forever to cook. It was weird not to cut up the sausage.

Wanted to like this more but it just seemed to be lacking something despite good quality sausage and cider. I don't think we'll make again.

I made exact to the recipe with exception of one item. Could not find smokes chicken and apple sausage nor just smoked chicken sausage, so I used chicken and chipotle and Monterey jack cheese. Was delicious. My husband said it was just okay but he says he doesn't like cooked cabbage no matter what, but yet loves sauer kraut and cole slaw. Fickle man.:-)

Very Good. Don't get the 4 stars wrong but 5 stars is reserved for blow your socks off recipes.
The flavor was very good, the steps are pretty straight forward, but IMO step 4 and 5 are 1 step not 2.  I was looking for a side dish to pair with it and could not think of what would fit.
I my case, we has some homemade chicken-apple sausage that was given to us and it worked great.  Had a little more seasoning than the typical Aidels.  Also to those who use apple juice and not cider, expect it to be very sweet and not have the tang that cider brings to the mix

I don't under stand to the people who said it was too acidic or sour from the vinegar. People reading is fundamental. it doesn't say vinegar anywhere, what it does say is apple cider or apple juice. I don't know why people make things wrong or add and delete things then give it a low rating. When you make things for the first time and you are going to rate it rate it as it is written. I made this recipe and was nice and sweet and will make it again and tweek to my families taste. All in all a good base recipe and is good as written.

Since this was the first time I tried the recipe, I followed it as closely as possible, given the ingredients available at my local grocer.  We liked it and I would make it again with these adjustments:  reduce the liquid by at least a third; reduce the quantity of potatoes by half; increase the number of sausage links by at least two (or double it).  Recipe made enough for left-overs and there are too many potatoes left without enough sausages.  So I'll add sausages when I reheat it tonight.  And I used apple cider, not juice.  Might try adding some fennel next time.

I read through all of the reviews before making this and a couple of adjustments or tips made this dish great.  My husband and I eat mostly a vegetarian diet and I found some non GMO tofu Chicken Apple Sausages at the grocery store.  I did cut up the potatoes into eighths and I used a spiced apple cider from Trader Joe's.  I didn't remove the potatoes just let it simmer down and the consistency is perfect.  Can't wait for my husband to come home and try it! (note if you are going with the veggie sausages then cook them in the oil and butter and put them aside until you are ready to serve, stir in and eat.  The sausages cook so fast they are easy to overcook and you want them to be just right). ENJOY!

I made this tonight, and turned out awesome.  Added some baby carrots to it when the potatoes went in. Used all natural apple juice , wondering if it thickens more with cider? Love the apple flavor of the cabbage!

This recipe was great! Chef John's videos are also always entertaining and easy to follow. I will note that I wasn't able to find chicken apple sausage, so I used Sam's Choice Polish sausage instead, which still came out great. :)

It was interesting cooking with apple cider. I was a little afraid of the sweetness, but after cooking it down it added a pleasant taste. While finishing cooking everything tasted okay and then I added the Dijon mustard as a garnish. The mustard really rounded out this dish! Next time though I'll try a sausage that's more savory than the apple and chicken sausage. That bit of bite and salt might really complete the dish. We all gave it good reviews and we'll definitely make this one again! I'll bet it will even taste better tomorrow.

This is very good and can be tweaked to your tastes. I use smoked sausage such as Farmer John or other commercial brands. We don't really care for chicken sausage so we use beef. I double the amount of  potatoes and sometimes use a mixture of potatoes and carrots. I have also used sauerkraut instead of cabbage just because we like it. I do add 2 Tbs of cider vinegar because it just goes so well with it.

I thought this was really good.  I used apple juice for the liquid.  I am gong to make it again with cider (not vinegar) and see the different.  I love cabbage, raw and cooked so this was a perfect recipe for me.  I followed the instructions exactly.  It is a bit sweet from the apple juice, but that was not a negative for us.  If you like sausage and cabbage I would think you would love this slightly different take on this old standard.  Thanks!

What a pleasant surprise!  I really didn't think this was going to go over well, but I wanted to try it.  Needless to say, it was just wonderful!  Full of flavor and quite different from the norm. A great one dish dinner!

This was absolutely amazing. I used 3 cups of apple cider, as I imagined apple juice would be too sweet. The chicken apple sausage was pre-cooked, so I only heated them for a minute or so before adding the onion. Our grocery store didn't have Yukon potatoes, so I chopped up some small potatoes. It was too difficult to get the sausage and potatoes out from under the cabbage, so I just left them all in there as the cider cooked off. This left the potatoes a bit soggy, but the whole meal was scrumptious. The others I was cooking for don't typically like cabbage, but they went back for seconds on this one. Will definitely make again.
