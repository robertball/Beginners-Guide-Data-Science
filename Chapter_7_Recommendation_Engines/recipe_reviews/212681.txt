Great recipe. In Louisiana ,down on the Bayou Teche we did this a lot, sometimes with Cola, then with  1/2 Cola and 1/2 Apple cider or even sometimes with Root beer. Try using a reduction to about 1/2 the amount of Cola or other as a baste. Note: never use a DIET Cola or DIET root beer ! Fantastic on ham !

Love it!  I tried it out before turkey day just to make sure it was tasty on a smaller bird and it worked out great.  Highly recommended!

I roasted a turkey using this recipe last night! My family & I were very happy with the results! This was probably one of the most tender & juicy turkeys we've ever had! In addition, the beautiful golden brown color made for a great presentation! I followed the recipe as written & wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for posting this recipe! It will be a "family tradition" from now on!

I used root beer instead of cola and it worked great!  The turkey browned very nicely and was juicy and tender.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that the gravy I made from the pan drippings was too sweet for me, but my husband liked it!

I'm not the world's best book, so this was the first time I ever made my own turkey. It was the best turkey I've ever tasted, hands-down. My guests at my Thanksgiving dinner just gobbled (lol) it all up!  It turned out nice and juicy with a tasty flavor to it.  I'll be using this method every time I make my turkeys now.

This did brown especially beautiful and tasted good, but I probably would not use this recipe again.

Not sure what I did wrong but my turkey did not look like the picture. That said it did turn out great. I made no modifications other than using a turkey breast only. 

I did go the extra an starting at the bottom of the breast working up I slowly peeled the skin back keeping it in one piece. the slit the meat of the turkey  and rubbed  the mixture into the meat. then brought the skin back over an coated the outside. I think this made for some really tender and flavorful meat.

I made this turkey recipe exactly as written for Thanksgiving this year, and it was just about the best turkey I'd ever eaten. It was moist inside and slightly sweet on the outside. It cooks up beautifully, nice and even brown. I used the leftover broth and turkey for turkey and noodles. Another big hit! Highly recommend!

I roast my turkey using cola rum or brandy half way through the roasting process this way I can still get some of the gravy juices without the rum and coke flavor. I also add a lot of other things such as a variety of herbs. I rub it in Miracle Whip, small amount of mustard, and pour melted butter on it. It is always a hit.
