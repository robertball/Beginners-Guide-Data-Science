Wow - I didn't read the reviews before I made this and I'm glad I didn't, because we loved it!!!  My kids all went back for 2nds and my husband, who doesn't really like chicken, said this is a keeper!!  The sauce was not as thick as I was expecting, so next time I will try to make it thicker....I served it with garlic toast that was great for mopping up the juices - next time I will add the Ceasar salad that another reviewer suggested!

I did not care for this recipe.  The sauce came out pepto-bismal pink!  After that it was bland and dull.  I will never make this stuff again.

This was okay. I would double the sauce next time and serve over noodles or rice.

Great recipe. We loved it, done as directed. I also see the sauce as great on pork or pasta.

Very Quick and easy.  I did not find it too sweet (used the reccomended BBQ sauce).  I served it with a ceasar salad and a nice Chardonnay.  Made for an nice evening.

This was OK. The first bite was a little on the sweet side but that was probably my fault because I used honey barbecue.
