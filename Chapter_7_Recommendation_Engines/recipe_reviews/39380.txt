Delicious! This has become a regular in our house. I put stew meat in the crock pot and cover it with the marinade mixture. Then when I get home from work I make rice instead of pasta and thaw a bag of frozen broccoli in the microwave. Mix the meat and broccoli and put it over the rice. Its an easy dinner!

This dish is delicious and easily made. Instead of using small mushrooms, I bought one large mushroom and sliced it to death, which came out great for this dish. I also substituted 1 cup of rice for the pasta, because I think that Chinese dishes should have a rice base and not pasta. If you substitute rice, you may need to use more bullion. Finally, I used a bag of frozen broccoli florets that I defrosted for 1 minute in the microwave- I find that most frozen vegetables are actually fresher and taste better when frozen than when you buy them supposedly "fresh," plus you get more for your money since you're not buying the lousy broccoli stalks.
 
For those who say that the dish was bland or was too tough, maybe this is what went wrong:

Make sure that the beef is cut thin. Some supermarkets sell round beef "sandwich slices" with little fat and cut thin- all you really might need to do is to cut each slice in half and you'll be good to go. It was quite tender when I made it, unlike some people's remarks here. Important: make sure the cut is from Round Beef or Top Sirloin, not chuck, “stew beef” or something else inferior.

The recipe says to throw out the marinade before mixing the beef with the rest of the dish. Don't do that. Instead, make sure you really press all the marinade well into the beef using the back of a fork when marinating. If you do that then you won't have any extra marinade to discard anyway. This gives the beef excellent flavor and makes it tender.

This was soooo good! I used a regular onion instead of green onions (didn't have any) and used no yolk egg noodles instead of the linguine. I also added a splash of orange juice to the stir fry. WOW!

This was so good. I let the meat simmer for an hour because my husband was late from work, then added broccoli and mushrooms. The meat was very tender and the flavors blended nicely.

The portions were off, the cooktime was understated by about 15 minutes, way way way too salty.  I spent over an hour slaving just to waste product and mess up my kitchen.  Will NEVER ever make this again.  Do not recommend for anybody.

This recipe is great! I did not include the mushrooms, and used my own beef broth (saved in the freezer from a previous pot roast) and potato starch instead of corn starch. It was very simple to cook, and it tasted like "real" chinese. The whole family loved it and I will definitely make it again!

Fantastic recipe!  It's delicious cold too.  I'm giving 4 stars because I altered it a little bit.  If you're interested:
I didn't have Italian dressing so I didn't use it.  I used a little extra soy, hoisin sauce, fresh minced ginger in place of ground and a couple shakes of red pepper flakes.  Marinated it for an hour or so.

I think the beef bouillian cubes added to the pasta water make all the difference...delicious!

This is a good beef broccoli recipe and the inclusion of noodles makes it like a traditional lo mein (soft noodle) dish.  A definite 'keeper'.  Thanks Jolene.

This dish was really good!  It was very flavorful and really did taste like take-out.  Needed a little more sauce though.

Okay.  It says that it tastes "like take-out."  But I've never had takeout broccoli beef with pasta.  Have you??? Plain steamed rice is better when it's on the side.

Instead of using bullion cubes, use an eqaul amount of low sodium beef broth...The sodium content in the cubes is very high.

I cooked this tonight.  We found it rather bland.  Rather than throwing the marinade away, next time I will keep it and put it along with the beef in the skillet.

I'm sorry. I did not like thiis. Hubby did so it gets 3 stars. I found it to salty and a nasty aftertaste.  It could have been the kikimon (however it's spelt) soy sauce, but I'm not about to try it again to find out.

This is a very quick and easy recipe, and defintely tasty! I "accidentally" made way too much pasta, but it was still really good. Loved that most of the ingredients are fairly basic pantry staples, so there wasn't a lot of running around town looking for special items. This one's definitely a keeper!

This was really delicious!  I am a new cooker so the directions were intimidating but it turned out great!  Smelled a little too gingery but tasted wonderful.  Husband loved it and would like it again.

This was a fantastic recipe! I made this for my family and we all gobbled it up! Even our three children! I left out the ginger only because I didn't have any. I made it a second time substituting beef anf beef broth for chicken and chicken broth. I'm making it again on Friday and will double the brocolli because we fight over who gets it. Adding more will make us not have to fight over who gets it! Thanks for this recipe!

Amazing! I had to double the marinade and i marinated it for about an hour to really let the beef soak up the flavor. This was delicious meal everyone loved. Next time I to double the whole recipe!

I used the crock pot....used stew meat, browned it and used the marinade ingredients plus a can of beef broth for a few hours. HOWEVER....I made an honest mistake, that turned out good. I grabbed Terriyaki sauce instead of Soy sauce...I had splashed some Terriyaki sauce on the meat when it was browning, but used the Soy sauce in the crockpot..it was very good!! Added the broccoli, cooked low for another hour or so...then added linguini fini....very good!!!

Really good with a few changes.  First, use a tenderizer for the meat, and marinate longer - overnite would probably be good.  Triple the marinade and add to the final dish.  I added hoisin sauce to the marinade in equal part to soy sauce for more depth of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.  The bouillon added to the noodles is genius!

Help for the sodium count, but you'll have to bump up the spices.  I just purchased sodium free granulated BEEF bouillon that per 1/2 C could drop almost 400 mg for a little beef flavor I'm thinking of using Mrs.Dash's Steak Grill mixture. FF Italian dressing you might try just using balsamic vinegar and more spices (Mrs.Dash~garlic & herbs). I often use 2T of rice vinegar, 2 T of lite soy and 2 T. sugar w/minced garlic & fresh ginger for beef marinade. No sugar needed for chicken marinade because you don't need to break down the muscle.

This dish was just OK it needs more spices.I added the cornstarch to the beef broth and not the marinate where it should be added the starch has no use in the marinate.

A good dish, not quite as good as our local take-out, but a solid recipe to build on in the future. Followed the recipe almost exactly - we left the mushrooms out, because neither my husband nor I care for them. Anyone making this dish should definitely use a good steak; we used small sirloin cuts, but would bump up the quality next time. Would also recommend NOT throwing out the marinade, and instead adding some or all of it to the mix. I imagine that would help it retain some added flavor. Overall a decent recipe; we'll take the basic format of this and alter it in the future to try other variations.

Okay everyone, this recipe is only good if you don't have any taste buds!  Exactly like take out? That restaurant must have shut down.  I even tried marinating the beef for more than 15 minutes and this meal still had no flavour.

This was not a bad recipe but I would suggest using a more tender cut of beef than round.  Maybe sirloin...I found the meat to be a tad tough.  Otherwise a nice, flavourful dish.  Took the suggestion to serve it with white rice as it seems just a bit odd to serve it over fettucine.  Hubby liked it more than I did, so I will probably make it again to make him happy.

Really good!  Add the mushrooms with the broccoli and rice noodles instead of linguini it would be perfect. Sauce is delicious.

It was pretty good. Family really liked it and it actually tasted better cold (after it had more time to marinate in the juices). I don't believe that the beef had enough time to marinate, I think if it was given longer than 15 minutes it would be better. Also, I believe the ingredients were a bit out of proportion, but that's just my opinion. Overall, it was actually tasty. Like another reviewer, added onion to mine, also green peppers.

This was not my favorite dish but it was perfectly edible.  I will probably not make it again.  I think I would prefer a thicker and more flavorful sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed.  The steak was tough, the entire dish was very bland and dry.  There needs to be more sauce.

The flavor of the beef was terrific - I think that it's a great start. What I didn't like about this recipe is the pasta. I would cook this with rice or with Asian noodles instead. I would also replace the 1/2 c of beef broth with water and beef bouillon in the sauce. I think that adding a little bit of corn starch to the sauce would make it a little thicker/richer instead of thin and watery. This really is a great recipe though - lots of flavor & Asian flare.

It was a decent dish. I used everything low sodium (soy sauce, beef broth, boullion) and it still had enough saltiness. I only marinated the suggested time but I think it would benefit from a longer marinade. I just bought the stir fry beef from the store precut and it was pretty tough. I think I'll simmer it longer next time to see if it becomes more tender. But I would make it again.

Exactly like the take out I used to get.  I'm not sure why everyone is switching to rice...we had pasta with it when I got take out, and the pasta with this is amazing.  Even my 5 year old ate the broccoli.

This recipe tastes fantastic.  I really liked the marinade, but I gave it four stars because of the following modifications.  This recipe has far too much sodium in it, which, taste aside, just isn't healthy to serve my family.  I used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium beef broth to bring it down a little.  I also used low fat Italian dressing.  Instead of sodium soaked noodles, we had it over a mix of brown and white rice.  It was really good and the entire double batch was eaten in one sitting!

The whole family loved this.  I made it with venison(the tender back-strap), normal onions and frozen broccoli because that's what I had!  I also put a bit more broth and cornstarch in because we love sauce. I will certainly make it again.  Thanks for this simple and delicious dish!

Really good & everyone got seconds! I thought it was a bit too salty but might have been from using regular soy instead of low sodium -Everyone else thought it was just right so maybe I was being hypercritical. I can't think of anything else that needed fixin'! Great!

This was OK. I thought the sauce was a little watery. Next time I will thicken it with some cornstarch perhaps.

I decided to try this recipes because I enjoy a good beef-n-broccoli, but must say was disappointed with my results. For starters, I read every single review on this recipe and opted to double the amount of marinade as many others had suggested. I believe this made the dish too salty and was probably tastier with the amount of ingredients originally called for in the recipe. So while this was my mistake, I recommend to anyone trying this beef-n-broccoli recipe to follow it exactly. It would probably have been a lot lighter in flavor (not to mention healthier) with the amount of marinade called for. The Italian dressing called for also seemed to add a different kind of flavor to the dish overall that strayed away from the traditional Asian flavor of the meat and veggies. Not sure I liked it very much. 

I also substituted steamed broccoli from the microwave rather than fresh to save time and added baby corn in lieu of mushrooms (just for personal taste), and the veggies turned out delicious. I did not have linguine on hand so resorted to using angel hair, which I think absorbed way too much of the beef bouillon and added to the overall sodium content of the dish. Again, my mistake as far as not following the dish to a 'T' but if I were to try this recipe again, I would opt for serving over white or brown rice. 

Overall, I give it three stars because the variations I made were not good ones (my fault), and I believe the dish would have fared better had I not made any changes.

I cooked the meat in the crock pot in the marinade which made it turn out like roast, but I drained it and then made the marinade again (minus the Itailian dressing and using refridgerated ginger) and threw in lightly steamed broccoli and let it all mix together. My daughter loved it. My husband and I added sweet chili sauce and it was good. I didn't have noodles so I served it w/ brown rice.

Okay, I made a few changes (added more sauce like others and used low-fat dressing) but still gave it 5 stars because my 3 AND 5 year old asked for seconds.  I haven't had that happen for a very long time.  Not only that, but hubby went for seconds too.  I liked the change from rice and thought it had plenty of flavor.  Thanks for sharing a healthy, kid-friendly recipe.  This one goes in the rotation.  (My 5 year old just thanked me for dinner--I LOVE it!)

Marinate the beef at least 6 hours and then dump it all in.  You will not be disappointed.

Quick and easy, doubling the recipe makes it great for game nights! Great stuff! Made it with rice and it came out just as well. Added some water chestnuts and baby corn to give it some more crunch. Tasted fine.

My family would NOT stop raving about this dish. They agree that it's better than take-out. Looks like I'm the new Chinese Carry Out place for my family! I made this low carb for my dad who is on the Atkins by using Dreamfield Linguine and it turned out FABULOUS! It's a nice change of pace for all you low carbers out there!

I enjoyed this dish very much.  I have never had take out beef broccoli, but it seemed to have the quality of take-out.  It was also much more healthier too!  Since we cook only for two, and there was no small pieces of the round steak at the store, we used a piece of sirloin steak.  I think this substitution really helped ensure tender pieces of meat.  I also kept the beef broth on hand while it cooked so it did not get too dry.

FABULOUS!

I threw the marinade in with the rest, and used some of the broth from the noodles instead of opening a new can for the beef broth, but it turned out perfect. I have two very picky eaters and they are 4 and 5 years old. They loved it too especially my 5 year old who doesnt like beef that much.

great food! proportions seemed a little off. served three, not four, and that's with a side of asparagus. next time, i would cut the broccoli up smaller, or marinade it too- putting it in last, it doesn't soak in all the flavors. my brother-in-law had no complaints though! definitely a do over!

I didn't have any Italian dressing, so I just used extra soy sauce.  This was really good, I will be making it again.  I also made some fried rice from this site to go along with it.

This recipe was OK, not the best or the worst I've had. I made 1 1/2 times the marinade (didnt have enough on hand to make 2 times the amount) but wish I would have been able to double or even triple it. The marinade smelled and tasted great but more would have made the dish much better. I only had crystallized ginger but that worked fine; I just ground it against a microplane. I also used green pepper, onion, and broccoli. I feel like the beef broth just watered things down too much. I used long spaghetti noodles as that's all I had on hand and didnt really taste the beef bullion on them like I thought I would. All in all, a decent meal, but not one I would make again as is.

Loved this but found it rather bland. Maybe I'll add a little more ginger next time, some salt, and perhaps oyster sauce.

This wasn't a bad meal, it just wasn't anything over the top either. It was just an okay meal for dinner. I probably wouldn't make it again, but was worth trying. My BF liked it a lot and he took the leftovers for lunch today.

So good I had to post it on FB between helpings!  I didn't have mushrooms, ginger, or cornstarch and  it was still worth a 5 star rating.  I mixed up extra marinade to cook it in and my husband raved about the sauce.  When the meat & broccoli was gone we had extra sauce to eat with the noodles (cooked 8 oz. instead of 4).  Even my picky 4 yr old loved it. Definitely a keeper!

Family LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!  But, also feeling the way another reviewer felt, I made rice (brown rice) with this dish instead of pasta.  Also did not use the cornstarch as we do not eat corn.

Made this for dinner last night and it was very good!  Had to leave out the ginger and substitute frozen broccoli for fresh (I wasn't trekking out in the snow for anything) but the kids really liked it anyway.  Next time it'll be even better when I have the proper ingredients on hand.

A little bland in flavoring.  I added chopped green and red peppers.  I used yellow onion instead of green.  I would add crushed red pepper and a few other things to spice it up or made add more ginger and such to give it a little more flavor.

My husband and I thought this was okay.  There was really something missing though, there wasn't much flavor at all.  I think it's a good base but there needs to be some sort of sauce to boost the flavor.

This was quite a bit of trouble for a very average and bland meal.  We found ourselves adding extra soy sauce to give it some flavor.  I probably won't try this again.

Wow!! This was incredible. The only change I made was I added a thinly sliced carrot (my daughters love carrot in the beef broccoli from our favorite Chinese restaurant). I added the carrots with the mushrooms & green onion. It was incredible..no leftovers!

My family loved this recipe.  I used Eye round steaks and sliced them very thin.  They came out very tender and very tasty!  I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old and they both cleaned their plates and asked for seconds (which is unusual in our family!)  I agree that it needs to thicken more, so I will add more cornstarch with the broth next time, but otherwise this was great!

Here is yet another clash between my fiance and I. I thought this was bland, and not at all like the Chinese version, he thought it was amazing. Add oyster sauce for a more authentic flavor and serve over rice.

Strengths:  it is a great base recipe.  The linguine boiled in beef broth has a unique flavor that complements the dish. The broccoli stir-fried at the end is perfect -- a little bit cooked, a little big crunchy. Weaknesses:  Following directions accurately and even using kitchen timers, my meat was incredibly tough.  I bought a high-quality round steak and it was so rubbery it went to the dogs.  Additionally, the dish is very bland and lacks any distinct flavor.  The marinade smells nice, but the flavors didn't transfer into the cooked dish.  I will definitely try it again, making more of the reader suggestions, and amping up the flavor.  I think this is a great starter/base recipe, but it needs some tweaking.

Yum! My first attempt at making Asian food myself. I used flour instead of cornstarch, the water/boullion that the pasta boiled in, in place of the 1/2 cup beef broth, yellow onion instead of green and frozen broccoli instead of fresh. I put the onion in with the beef, but added the mushrooms with the liquid, after the beef was browned. Then I added the frozen brocolli, covered and simmered for 10-15 min. yum yum yum. Oh, slice the beef super thin.

This was really fast, easy, and good. My 4 year old son loved it. I did purchase pre-cut stir fry beef, added extra onion, and used the beef liquid from the pasta instead of the beef broth. The startch from the pasta helps the liquid to thicken a bit.

I'm sure this is very nice;  however the comment 'and it tastes like take-out' boggled my mind!  Surely good home-made tastes are the benchmark - not take-out flavours.  Take-out should be aiming for "home-made flavour"!

Not exactly take-out material, but it was easy to make and tasty enough. There didn't seem to be enough sauce for the noodles. Discarding the marinade was unnecessary since the beef soaked it all up. I suggest making more of the marinade.

Very tasty.  We didn't use the pasta recipe- we served ours with rice; we prefer it that way.  Very tasty brown sauce- make sure you add the ginger.
We also used leftovers of Tangy Grilled Beef for the meat- it was perfect.

Very nice! It's a bit different than take out, but still very good. I used thinly sliced ribeye, and I admit, it was a bit tough. But the sauce was good and the broccoli was great. I used some noodles I got from the Asian market that were wide, but tasted similar to Ramen noodles. It was a very good match.

This was great. I used bow tie pasta (it is easier for my little one to eat) and put snap peas instead of mushrooms because that is what I had. As far as anything else I didn't change anything and it was quick and easy and delicious to eat. I'm glad that I doubled it so we can eat it for leftovers. Even my four year old liked it and she doesn't like anything, so that has to say something. It did to me anyway. Thank you for this recipe. I will make it again for sure.

If I make this again, I will double the marinade as there just wasn't enough to properly cover the meat. Like other reviewers, I did not discard the marinade since the meat had soaked up almost all of it anyway. 

I was very disappointed that the finished dish was extremely bland and had very little flavor. If I make this again, I will also double up on the spices, and add some szechwan sauce to the marinade. 

I am rating this 2 stars... One for being simple and easy to prepare, and one for being somewhat of a healthy dish.

the first time i cooked this dish, i didn't find it appetizing at all.  the italian dressing gave this dish a really weird taste and it was waaaaay too salty.  i didn't use the boullion, beef broth, nor the italian dressing.  i added some other ingredients to make it more flavorful: sliced red onion, chopped green onion, sesame oil, and some sriracha hot chili sauce to give it a kick (can be bought at any asian grocery store).

I loved the flavor of this..although I did make a few adjustments. No one in my house like mushrooms or onions, so I subbed a red bell pepper instead, and it worked really well! I also added a bit of orange juice when the meat was simmering, and also simmered in all of the marinade, and did not throw any out. I think it definitely needs the extra marinade in there to make sure there is enough sauce to coat everything nicely. I even added a few more dashes of soy and italian dressing into the pan because it seemed like there wasn't enough sauce. Last change was that I marinated the meat for more like 4 hours instead of 15 minutes. Great recipe that is easily modded and the flavor is great! Thanks..will definitely make this again. :]

I tried this recipe and it was a HIT in my house! My husband loved it, the kids loved it. The only adjustment I made was that the round steak called for was to tough, so I got thin sliced Bulgogi meat. It was perfect!!

I was reluctant about mixing pasta in with an "asian" meal, plus, I'm not a big pasta person, but it came out so great!  I used whole wheat thin spagetti because that's all I had.  The whole wheat is disguised nicely in this sauce for any picky eaters.  My husband and kids loved it!  Will make again soon.

this cut of beef was too chewy for the dish.  Cooking pasta in beef broth is a great idea, though!

Although I loved the marinate sauce (made the beef very tender) I would not say this is as good as take-out. Instead of broccoli I used a frozen stir-fry blend and it came out OK.

I'm not sure why anyone would call this recipe "bland" but it's definately not that! Perhaps the ones who thought this bland used a cheaper cut of meat?  The beef I used was very thinly sliced, so it just soaked up the flavor. I was very surprised at how well this turned out actually.  Tasted almost as good as my mother in laws...but took a fraction of the time to make.  Fair trade, I'd say.

This recipe was pretty good. I let the beef marinate for a few hours before preparing. I also left out the green onions since my family doesn't like them. I used fresh mushrooms and fresh broccoli. It tasted great! Aside from being a tad bland, otherwise it was very good. It was very easy to prepare and I can see many different ways of preparing it (adding carrots, subbing fresh green beans for the broccoli, etc). I will make this again!

Tasty and easy to make.  Watch the cooking time though, so as not to overcook meat, which will make it too dry/chewy.  I used sirloin strips and left out the pasta.  Great on brown rice!

Great.  I did use a little more beef broth, and again added a little ginger and soy sauce to the actual beef and broccoli because it lost a lot of the taste when I discarded the marinade.  Thought the noodles were a nice change, and leftovers were great.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Does need more sauce but flavor is good.   I marinated the meat for 4 hours.   Flavor was definitely in the meat.   This recipe is a keeper.

I tried it last night and it was easy to make and both my wife and I loved it.

I followed the recipe with one mistake on my part.  I did not sear the beef before adding the onion, mushroom, etc.  However, it came out well in spite of that.

Cooking the linguine in the beef broth made a distinct difference in the overall result, I believe.  I'm going to do that with other pasta dishes as well.

Bland, had to add a bunch of stuff at the end to punch up the flavor.  Doubled the marinade and there still wasn't any left over. Had to add 2 extra tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken sauce.

I thought this was a really nice recipe, also pretty quick and easy to make. I used whole grain spaghetti instead of linguine and I thought it turned out good. I think it could use a little more sauce, so next time I will try to add more. Also this wasn't the recipe's fault, but the meat I bought was hard, so next time when I make it I will get a softer cut of meat and it will be perfect!

I did not really, like this dish, was too soupy, I think I will find a different recipe.  I really did not like the addition of the Italian dressing.  I do not think I will be making this again, not really the taste I was looking for.

Very flavorful.  Very filling.  I only rated 4 stars as I served with rice instead of noodles (not a fan of any noodles with beef).  Will make again.

This was a little to salty for my taste - I would make it again but eliminate the beef bouillon.  Was a great conceptually.  I think next time I would also cook the meat seperate from the onions and mushrooms and toss together last.   I pre steamed the brocolli and tossed in last and this worked perfectly.

this dish wasn't bland at all but I did not drain the marinade as the meat soaked it all up. If anything it was too salty. I used homemade Italian dressing and beef soup base which probably made it so salty. The meat did come out tender. I also used whole wheat linguini cooked in beef broth made from the soup base making it on the salty side. I felt it needed more variety of vegetables. Because it was so salty it probably would have been better with rice, but it was fine with the whole wheat linguini. I will try it one more time reducing the salt. I gave it 3 stars because I think the marinade was very good. If reducing the salt doesn't improve it, I doubt I'll make it again.

This was wonderful! I used whole wheat pasta and it turned out great. The only issue I has was there was a bit of a bitter flavor to it. I think it may have been from the fresh broccoli. I think next time I'll steam the broccoli first and then just toss it in at the end.

This was really good!!! I took the advice of putting it in the crock pot, however, I misunderstood and put the 6 cups of beef broth in the crock pot.  It was to late by the time I realized what I did so I strained out the meat, mushrooms and onions and cooked it according to the stove top directions - remaking the sauce.  It was really good.  I served it with rice.  Hubby really liked it however he would like me to add some red pepper to it next time to give it a little bit of bite!!  Good recipe! thanks for sharing!!!

Great dish and easy to put together.  I had a tough piece of meat, so I changed it up a little and let it simmer in the broth (with a few carrots) until tender.  I used Raman noodles and the whole family loved it.

This was very good!  My picky teenage boys really enjoyed it too.  Since they eat so much food, I did 12 oz of whole wheat pasta instead and doubled the sauce to make it go a bit further.  I loved the flavor of the pasta after boiling it in the bullion cubes. What a great idea!

Loved it!!!!  The marinade mixture needs to be doubled, and use less water, but it was great.  Out two year old picked out all the mushrooms and meat and begged for more.  This will be a regular.

This was fantastic.  Hub couldn't stop complimenting the dish.  The only thing I did differently was threw in a handful of almonds when tossing it together.  Says it serves 4, not for us.  Closer to 2 if it's all we're having.  It was enough to serve all 4 of us because we it alongside egg rolls and general tao chicken.  This recipe has earned a spot taped to the inside of my cupboard with all our other favorites.

I followed the instructions exactly (minus the linguine). While it looked great and smelled great, it was bland and tasteless. We won't be making this again.

It was good as far as broccoli beef goes.  I would probably make it again.

I combined the onions, garlic and ginger in a pan with butter and olive oil and then added the marinated beef.  I poured everything in the crock pot for 3 hours.  We used top sirloin and didn't thcken it with corn starch.  It probably could have used some thickening but, it was very good the way it was.

This meal is tasty and easy to make, plus it's real simple to change it up to suit individual tastes. First off, I sauteed onions and garlic in a little butter in the pan, then lightly coated the beef with flour before browning on all sides. Then I added the other ingredients to the pan (eliminated cornstarch) including all of the wonderful marinade (did not discard!), and simmmered for a few minutes. I added extra soy sauce, used a lot (nearly a half bottle) of fat free Italian Dressing, plus the little package of flavoring from Top Ramen Oriental flavor noodle soup. After simmering a few minutes, I poured the whole thing into the crockpot along with cup or so of beef broth to juice it up some. Cooked on high in the crockpot for several hours. It came out tasty and tender! I don't like my broccoli crunchy, so it works well for me. Otherwise, wait a while before adding the broccoli to the crockpot. Had potatoes on the side, but tonight will have the leftover with the Ramen noodles. Love this recipe! And it smells so good while cooking! Would give five stars except for the changes, that cut of beef seems a little too tough for pan cooking. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for my family Saturday night.  We all found it very bland.  I used sirloin and it could have cooked longer to tenderize the meat.  I won't make it again.

Seemed alittle bland, wanted more of the taste of chinese takeout. I added hoisin sauce to my plate and it gave it some spice but probably would not make again. Want to try another recipe for beef and broccoli:)

Not a fan of this one.  I followed the recipe to the T, but the steak was a little tough and the overall flavor was just OK.  It was very simple to make, but I won't be keeping this recipe.  Maybe it would be better with chicken?

So bland. I would marinade longer or something. I didnt like it at all, it just had no flavour and the "sauce" was soupy and watery :( If this is what take out is like then I'll stick to my kung pao chicken. I followed the recipe exactly as it says.

I omitted the mushrooms (because I don't care for them) and used frozen broccoli since that's what I had on hand - otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  I doubled the recipe and made it while my parents were visiting and everyone said it was great.  It's not take-out, but still good and easy to make.  Will use this recipe again.

This was wonderful!  I did use round steak & left the meat marinating in the fridge for 2 days.  By the time I cooked it, it was not tough, but I will use a more tender cut of meat next time.  I also added a whole onion, cut in strips, a green and a red bell pepper.  I doubled the recipe and there were no leftovers!  It was as good as any restaurant.  A good dish for company!

My family and I really liked this recipe, however I think the cornstarch would have been better used to thicken the beef broth instead of the marinade. Overall, we enjoyed it. Love the idea of cooking the noodles in the bouillion! It really made a difference.

My first use of an Allrecipe selection. Maybe I expected too much.  As a novice cook I followed the directions.  It was a too bland for me.  Needed more sauce and more asian spice flavor.

One Word... Awesome! And my husband feels the same way.  I substitutes the beef for chichen, for preference, and mushrooms for bell pepper.  I would agree with the ithers in saying double the marinade and use for sauce when dish is simmering.  We had it with garlic sticks.  Just an all around supurb meal!

This Broccoli Beef taste nothing like take out or dine in Chinese food. It was good and my 8 yr old son loves it, so that is a good thing. I will probable make it again, just because of my son. It was simple to make, that's for sure.

My family loved this!!  I too, added a splash of orange juice to mine.  I did NOT use mushrooms though and.. also didn't have any of the "low fat" or "low sodium" variety stuff so I used the regular!  It was a hit with my picky children too, you can't beat that!

good! taking the advice of the other reviews, i also doubled the marinade and cooked the beef in the 'remaining.' I  dissolved 'better than buillion' in to boiling water and used that to cook the rice, rather than pasta. amazing!

I made this with chicken instead of beef but it still came out tasty. I made a few adjustments to it. I skipped the pasta part and paired it with homemade fried rice. Also, I did not use onions because I'm the only one in the family that likes them. Same with the mushrooms. Overall it was good and simple to put together!

Definately double the sauce- I did and it still wasn't quite enough.  It also needs a little kick, there's some flavor, but on the bland side.  I will be experimenting on that.  Also, I will try it in the crock pot next time to hopefully help make the meat more tender and bring out more flavor.  A recipe worth working with, and very easy to toss together.

This is a great recipe.  I used leftover steak instead of raw meat.  Cooking the noodles in beef bouillon made them very flavorful.

This was pretty good! I made it according to the recipe except like some others I put the marinade in the mix instead of discarding it.  I'm glad I did, as I thought it needed a bit more flavor - can't imagine what it would have been like without the flavorful marinade.  So, 4/5, a little more flavor would have made it a 5/5 recipe.  Will make again.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is it said to strain the meat from the marinade and I just threw it all in the pan.  I think it would have been really too bland if I hadn't.  Next time I might even make a bit more of the marinade to throw in.

Over all this was a great recipe and I can't wait to make it for my Mom.  It was also very simple to make as well.

This recipe was OK, but I doubt that I will make it again when there are so many better dishes out there.  The meat tasted good, but it was nothing special.  I wish I had substituted rice for the noodles, maybe I would have liked it better.

I found this pretty bland.  I liked the concept - beef, broccoli, long thin noodles, and mushrooms, but the sauce needed a lot more - garlic, onions, maybe red pepper?

I thought that this tasted even better than takeout! My whole family just loved this, and it was so easy to make. I left out the green onions and mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them, and I used frozen broccoli to make life easier. We will definitely be making this again and again!

This was a big hit!  Having a stir fry with pasta instead of rice was a nice change.  I didn't use quite as much bouillon as the recipe called for only because I was concerned with the sodium content.  It  didn't hurt the taste of the dish.  Delicious and I will definatly make it again!

This is really good.  Hubby and I both loved it.  I used low sodium, gluten free soy sauce (La Choy) and Tinkyada gluten free noodles.  Next time I'll put some sliced onion in it as well as the green onions.  It's really good the next day for lunch as the noodles kind of take on more of the sauce flavor. Yummy!

Good...but not restaurant quality. Made 2 changes; used 1 med onion instead of green onion, and served with rice instead of noodles. Thought it needed "something", so I mixed in a  very small amount of sriracha hot chili sauce. That zipped it up a bit!

We thought this was good... not exactly like take-out, but good. I left out the mushrooms (thought I had some but didn't) and used spaghetti noodles instead of linguine. The meat itself seemed to lack a little bit of flavor but everything else, especially the noodles, were tasty. If I make this again, I'll add some sliced yellow onions.

This cut of meat was not very tender.  I thought the dish was a little blah and boring.  I didn't find the sauce "rich" at all.  Will not make again.

well, more like 4 1/2 stars!  this was good, the kids liked it too.  altho my finicky hubby said to leave the chinese cooking to the chinese...everyone else ate it and asked for me...and i have 3 children..so that's saying alot!  i added some seseme oil to the frying skillet before adding the meat so the meat would make a little more juice...just about 2 tablespoons.  gave it a great flavor, too!  also, i used thinly sliced onions (its all i had) and all fresh veggies.  i highly recommend it!  we added some chinese hot sauce to our bowls (we like it hot!).  oh, and we used regular soy sauce since everyone said it needed more salt!  thanks for a great and quick recipe! yum!

This was awesome.  I left the mushrooms and onions out to make it more kid-friendly, and my kids loved it.

This was ok--it can't compare to restaurant Chinese, though.

This came out very well, except that it could've used a little more salt. That could be left to personal preference, though. All-in-all, came out great and very easy-to-follow instructions.

This was an okay recipe - but I was hoping for much more flavor.  I'll keep looking.
