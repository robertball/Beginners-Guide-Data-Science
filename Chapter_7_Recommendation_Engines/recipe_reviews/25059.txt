I really like these!  I made a few changes, though.  I remembered reading somewhere that you can cut almost half of the sugar out of any recipe without affecting the end product.  So I cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  I also used fat-free plain yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I don't have a 10x15 pan so I used a 9x13 and cooked it for 30 min.  I got a nice, moist cake-like bar.  I also frosted it with a Chocolate Peanut Butter frosting made of 2C powdered sugar, 2T cocoa, 4T milk, 2T peanut butter, and 1/2t vanilla.  I really enjoyed these for a way to use up ripe bananas besides the standard banana bread.

I have never made these bars without someone asking for the recipe. Just use 2-3 lg. very ripened bananas and you will have plenty of flavor.  Please don't put store bought frosting on them.  There is a recipe on this site for Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting that is a superb complement to these bars.  ENJOY!  Bring copies with you!

My only complaint is that I can't give this recipe 6 stars! These are wun-der-ful! It's so great making a 'bar' recipe the comes out of the pan perfectly and makes a great presentation. I served them chilled because my sister has a similar recipe and for some reason it really brings out the banana flavor. I only used two really dark bananas but you could really taste the flavor; I added some cinnamon, too. For such a simple recipe it really does make a ton - an entire jelly roll pan... WOW! I made a softer frosting of one block cream cheese, 2 cups of powdered sugar, tsp vanilla and some milk to thin it out ever so slightly. Stop searching for recipes... turn off your computer & go make these. They are really delicious.

I made this as a bundt cake just because I got mixed up with another recipe I was considering. I cooked it for 40 at 375. It was light, moist and delicious. Not too sweet either. For the record, a cup of bananas is equal to about 2 good sized bananas mashed up. And if they seem not ripe enough, break them up and nuke it for about 12 seconds on high until you can easily mash them up with a fork.

I made these and they were very good! I used 3 large bananas (probably was more then the 1 cup called for in the recipe), substituted 1 cup of cake flour for part of the all-purpose, and cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup. If you refrigerate the bars after you frost them until the icing is firm, you can then cut them into individual servings and store in the freezer between wax paper sheets. They freeze beautifully and are great to have on hand for a quick dessert.

These are very, very good.  Like some others, I used a 9 x 13 inch pan and extended the baking time. I just kept checking them every 10 minutes or so until the toothpick came out clean. I also added one chopped banana to the finished batter for a little more texture.  The frosting is to die for and it makes a lot!  (I used the frosting that Tricia Jaeger suggesteds in her review).  A great recipe!  Everyone loved these cake like bars!

This recipe was GREAT!!
I loved it so much.  Instead of sour cream, I used vanilla yogurt and it tasted wonderful.  I also added walnuts into the batter.  The cake was also moist and really tasted like bananas!!  I used only about 5 oz worth of cream cheese frosting made by myself. I also used over ripe bananas (REALLY GOOD). If you are bringing this dish to a fancy party or for some big event like a birthday, jazz it up like I did. I dyed the frosting a very pale yellow and I put dark chocolate shavings ontop, in fact it even looked like a BANANA!! 
Thanx again! 
YUM!

Scrumptious! I used three bananas (about 1 1/4 C. bananas) and added about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, then frosted with homemade cream cheese icing and topped it off with walnuts. This is definitely a keeper!

These were great!  I, as many others stated, made my own frosting as I already had the ingredients on hand.  I used 4 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 C butter, 1 t vanilla and 3 1/2 C powdered sugar.  Update:  tried these as a cupcake and it worked beautifully, a half recipe yields 12 cupcakes.  This time I used recipe Cream Cheese Frosting II.

Holy moly are these things awesome good!  I did modify a little, but the things I did were not recipe integrity deal breakers.  First, I made half a recipe - just wanted a "modest" pan for the two of us.  What pan to use, tho,' when you're halving a 15x10" pan?  I didn't follow any scientific formula to figure it out - I just figured an 11x7" or 9x9" (which I used) would work out just fine - and it did.  As for the batter itself, I wanted to use buttermilk I had on hand rather than sour cream, and I knew I would have to make a slight adjustment.  For each cup of sour cream, I found, use 14 T. buttermilk and 3 T. butter.  So for my half recipe I needed 7 T. of buttermilk (I measured out 1/2 c. then removed a tablespoon) and an additional 1-1/2 T. of butter.  I used slightly more bananas - 3/4 c. for the half recipe.  I also used a tried and true mixing technique I was more comfortable with - cream the sugar and butter well, add the egg(s) and vanilla, and finally the bananas.  Add the flour mixture alternately in thirds with the sour cream (buttermilk), beginning and ending with the flour.  I knew bars this good deserved a homemade cream cheese frosting:  1/2 c. butter, 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese, 1 tsp. vanilla, 4 c. powdered sugar (I made half this recipe) These are moist and cake-like,  but be sure not to over bake if you want them this way!  I found 17-18 minutes perfect for my sized pan.  Pleasantly sweet and full of banana flavor; a delicious home-spun dessert.

I made these for a picnic and everyone enjoyed them.  I didn't frost, I just sprinkled the top with peanut butter chocolate chips as soon as they came out of the oven.  Easy to carry to your destination and I will be making these again.

These were very good..moist and yummy.  I really wouldn't classify it as a cookie though...not even brownie like.  I would just call it a banana cake and leave it at that.  If you are looking for a bar cookie, this isn't the recipe for you.  If you just want a delicious way to use up those banana...this is perfect!

Oh. My. Stars.  Absolutely, incredibly good.  The only changes I made were cutting the sugar to just under a cup and adding chopped walnuts.  Made into cupcakes (Yield: 24 full size and 9 mini muffins).  Baked at 350 for 18 minutes. (13 for the mini's)  Though they didn't need frosting, I wanted to try Jewel's maple take on the cream cheese frosting.  Used 3 Tbs Pure Maple syrup (didn't have any extract), and topped with a walnut.

I liked this recipe a lot.  They surprised me. The reason I tried it is because I needed to bring a dessert some where and this got so many great reviews. I generally don't like banana flavor.  But this recipe set me straight! They were great tasting the day I made them, but I personally liked them better the next day, cold.  I used Cream Cheese Frosting II to top them off.  One last thing, don't forget you can microwave your banana's if they don't seem ripe enough.  I had read about doing it (this recipe??), and it really worked. I broke up my yellow banana in a bowl, and microwaved it for 12 seconds. Then I mashed it.  I think I ended up putting it back in for a few more seconds.  The bars were great.

Banana frosting is a must. 2TBL melted butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 cup confectioner sugar, 1/2 ripe banana, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp lemon juice.
You will eat these right out of the pan!

This is a wonderful way to use up those old bananas! I use my own cream cheese icing: half an 8-oz package of cream cheese with 4 tablespoons of margarine and about 2-4 cups of icing sugar(dependant on how thick you like your icing!), hand whip room temperature ingrediants to make the perfect icing for this wonderful cake!

Absolutely delicious.  I know this is going to turn into one of my standby recipes.  As you can tell from the picture I added chopped walnuts on the top, just a personal preference.  

EDIT - I have made this several more times and it is a hit every time!  I add about a teaspoon of ground cinnamon every time, it just gives it a little something extra.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS RECIPE!

These are great...I used a 9x13 pan and just baked for about 10 extra minutes. Very moist I will use this recipe every time I have over ripened bananas.

These are really good, great banana flavor. Only problem I have is these are not dense enough to be considered a "bar". I was expecting something dense, and this turned out for me like a very thin cake. I will make these again but use a 9x13 pan so it's more of a cake than a thin layer. I topped these with mini chocolate chips also. I followed the recipe as written and baked them for 22 minutes which was perfect. If you need to store these after frosting them, let them set out for awhile after frosting. They are much easier to store if layering because the the frosting will "dry" a bit and allow you to layer them. Thanks for sharing :)

Definitely a new family favourite!  So quick and easy, with delicious results.  I sprinkled chopped walnuts over the icing for a bit of crunch.  Used light sour cream with no problems.

Made this cake in a 12X17 pan, so baked for only about 15 minutes.  Used a home-made cream cheese frosting.  YUM!  Loved by the whole family.

Excellent. Must be the sour cream that makes these so moist. I used 3 medium bananas, and followed the suggestion to use a 9x13 glass dish. Frosted with icing made from 1 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese, 2 cups icing sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. Using this size pan, the results are more like cake than bars. Thanks, Delta for the great recipe!!!

Very good! Definitely think it's more like a cake than a bar. I halved the recipe, added walnuts, and baked it in an 8x8 pan. I didn't have cream cheese to make the frosting, so I drizzled carmel and chocolate sauces on it. Yum!

Absolutely delicious!  This was a big hit with everyone in my family, kids included.  This cake was easy to make and very moist.  It's going in my recipe collection.  I made my own cream cheese frosting:  1 (8 oz)  pkg  cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup butter softened, 1  tsp. vanilla, 3 cups powdered sugar, 1 tblsp. milk. One of my kids wants me to make it for his birthday party cake.  Thanks for sharing!  update:  I took the cake to his party and everyone LOVED it.  A few asked for second pieces and wanted the recipe.  Tip:  I put the bananas for the cake in a brown paper bag on the counter to ripen faster since I bought them too late to ripen on their own.

I am constantly asked to make these bars for family get togethers and anytime my husband spies bananas on the counter that have black spots he asks if i will make these!  So delicious. I do them in a 9X13 pan, so the baking time is a bit longer.  I also use at least 2, often 3, large bananas.  Wish they werent so good, or that they were less calories! So hard not too eat a lot at once.

YUMMY!  I followed the exact recipe only I did not use canned frosting.  I used 2 tablespoons butter, melted, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 cups confectioners' sugar, 1 medium ripe banana, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice.  The cake was a cross between cake & a bar.  The only change I will make next time will be adding some chopped walnuts either to the cake or maybe just sprinkle on top of the frosting.

Made according to the recipe except I used a homemade cream cheese frosting. Thought they were too heavy and although edible, not to our liking.

These bars are amazing. I halved the recipe and made them in a 8x8 pan. I topped them with the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting that another reviewer suggested. Way better than store bought frosting.

SO GOOD!! I used 3 bananas, which is a little over a cup, and 1 1/4 cup sugar and light sour cream.  I baked for about 30 minutes.  DO NOT use store bought frosting to ruin this moist and flavorful cake.  The recipe I used is 1 package of cream cheese, 5 tbsp butter(both softened), 1 tbsp sour cream and 1 tsp vanilla in the food processor for just 5 seconds, then add 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar and mix for about 10 seconds.  It's a perfect quantity for this cake.  If people like bananas they will rave about this recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  However, next time I make it, I will not use as much frosting.  Overall--great taste, easy to bake, and a hit with all.  Definitely great to take to a party.  They were wonderful!!!

These were quite good. Tasted like banana cake. Very easy to make, and a great way to use up too-ripe bananas.

Excellent recipe! Great banana taste and not too sweet. Stays moist and delicious for days! I added a little bit of cinnamon and used Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe, and added a little cinnamon to that too.

Great banana cake! I serve it plain for snacks or a quick dessert but I've dressed it up by frosting with a cream cheese frosting. Yum. My husband went crazy for this cake the 1st time I made it and couldn't wait for me to have some extra, over ripe bananas to make this cake again.

This is the first time I made banana bars and I bought a 15 x 10 jelly roll pan just for this recipe. They baked over and on to the floor of my oven. Despite the mess and extra work, they are delicious and I will make them again. I bought a 17 x 11 pan for the next time. I had three bananas so put all three in the recipe.

These are so delicious!  Go all the way and make cream cheese frosting with 1 8 oz. pkg cream cheese, and 1/2 cup butter (both softened), beaten until fluffy, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 4-6 cups of powdered sugar.  Yum!

I had a recipe for banana bars but lost it so I tried this one out. Very good banana taste. Only difference was I used 3 bananas instead of 1 cup. I used to have trouble with the center not being quite done and this one was no trouble at all. It's a keeper!!

These were delicious. I made a few modifications. I used  a cup of vanilla flavored greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. I added 1 cup of walnuts when I put in the bananas. I didn't have a 10x15 pan and used a 9x13 instead. It took an extra 10 minutes to bake but they turned out with a brownie type of consistency that was really good. Instead of frosting, I whipped some heavy cream and mixed in some cinnamon sugar and just served with a dollop on top. Next time I make this, I will probably add one more banana.

These were good, the bars were very moist.  The only problem I had was the  banana in the frosting.  Even with the lemon juice they turned brown and made the bars look very unappealing.

Absolute best use for over-ripe bananas. I've made these several times and they're always a hit. Today I made them using a mini-muffin pan and cups. They were just as moist and wonderful as the bars. I added about 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips chopped into small pieces. Only baked them for 17 minutes. Piped on the frosting to give it a gourmet look.

AWSOME!  ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS TO MAKE MY OWN FROSTING (I HATE ANYTHING PROCESSED) I USED 2 CUPS POWDERED SUGAR 1/2 CREAM CHEESE 1/2 STICK OF BUTTER APX. 1/4 C MILK.  I MELTED BUTTER AND CREAM CHEESE IN MICROWAVE APX. 45 SECONDS AND ADDED TO THIS THE SUGAR AND THEN ADD MILK TO KEEP IT SLIGHTLY STIFF AND CUT A SMALL CORNOR OFF OF A SANDWICH BAG AND FILLED IT WITH THE FROSTING AND JUST DRIZZLED OR PIPED THE FROSTING ON IN A SQUIGGLY DESIGN IT LOOKS KIND OF FANCY AND DIFFERENT THAN FROSTING JUST SPREADED

VERY good! It was more like a cake, but that is what I wanted.  I used 3 large bananas to make the flavor very strong! I also used less butter and sugar (because I was running out) and it still tasted awesome!

A.MAZ.ING. I actually used Splenda and half FF plain yogurt, half FF sour cream. I took the advice of cooksforfourty and added about a half cup of walnuts and about a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. I made Cream Cheese Frosting 2, which is also from this site, to go on top which really took it up a notch. I took it down to some neighbors and they loved it to pieces. I had one bite and had to restrain myself from having more.

My husband has the occasional luncheons at work where everyone brings in a dish for a pot luck.  I've done this recipe for him to take and now his boss comes to him and asks that I make the banana cake. There's little doubt which one he is referring to. We'd be happy to also give 6 stars for this recipe!

These were sturdy enough to eat with your fingers, but they lacked something in taste.  They did not have a great banana taste and I somehow want to attribute that to the sour cream.  (My bananas were definitely ripe enough.)  The kids who ate these didn't complain, but all in all, I found them to be just OK.  4 stars may be a bit generous.

Absolutely delicious!  I frosted the "bars" (more like a snack cake) with the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe on this site after they were completely cool.  Wow! It was perfect.  These were not real sweet and neither was the frosting.  Very moist with the addition of the sour cream.  I will definitely make this again and again.  EVERYONE at work loved them!

These are about the only thing that turn out great in my oven (I live in a high altitude city) I think the store bought cream cheese frosting is really good on these too. So did my company.

These bars are fantastic!  I sent them to work with my husband and every single one was gobbled up!  They only change I made was to use homemade cream cheese frosting and grate a little fresh nutmeg on top of the frosting.
I've also used this recipe as a base and added a can of pumpkin in place of the banana and it was the best pumpkin bar I've ever tried.  Thanks!!

Great recipe. I used 3 whole bananas and made it in a 9x13 pan, so they were thicker. Very tasty and easy to make....another great way to use up over ripe bananas. Took them to work and everyone love them.

Such a good recipe! I have made it many many times, but just now am FINALLY doing my review. :) The only thing I chage is I do not use pre made cream cheese frosting. I make my own, as my family liked my icing better.

The perfect answer to a lunch box treat! So dense and moist! I used bananas that were not that over-ripe so I added banana flavoring and oh my gosh! Out of this world! They were so pretty with a pecan half on top of each frosted piece. Looking for a coffee break treat? Look no further!

In the past month, I have made this recipe 4 times and everyone loved it!! I followed someone's suggestion to use the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting (?) and it even made it better. THANK YOU! This recipe is easy, yet the taste is so good :) Will keep making this over and over..

I just made this recipe today and it came out perfect. I think adding nuts would be a great option for this cake. It was very moist and delicious. I did not change anything in the recipe.

These turned out quite nice.  Cooked in a 11 1/2 x 14 1/2 pan and they were perfectly done after 25 minutes.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and frosted it the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site as suggested.  Took it into work today and received many compliments including "that was heaven!".  There were no leftovers:)

Excellent and easy to personalize. I followed some readers suggestions. Used a 13X9 inch pan and baked for 30 minutes. Had 4 VERY ripe bananas so I mashed 3 and diced the last, and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. I had a tub of vanilla icing that I mixed in banana extract which tastes great with the cake, and on top I sprinkled some finely ground nuts with cinnamon sugar that I happened to have on hand. All together it turned out amazing and got great reviews!

Delicious!  I also had to use a 9X13 pan as I don't have a 10x15, but with 35min of cook time (started checking at 25 minutes) they turned out great!

I made these for the first time.  Simple recipe.  I frosted them with cream cheese frosting.  Family came this afternoon and we tried them.  She said it was the best home baking she had ever had.  Thanks for the recipe.

These banana bars are incredible! I get so many compliments every time I make them and the whole family always requests a double batch! I only use 1 cup of sugar, which keeps them plenty sweet, and always make my own cream cheese frosting since these are far too tasty to just use store bought! This is a must-make dessert and a great way to use up those last couple of very ripe bananas.

I didn't have any sour cream so I used whipped cream cheese instead and they were great! They were moist and tasty and I used my moms cream cheese frosting recipe.

Fantastic!  I only changed one thing.  I didn't have sour cream so I used 12 oz. of banana flavored yogurt.  GREAT banana flavor and SO moist.

I made them, and Im not sure what I was expecting. They were good but not full of flavor like I wanted. Im giving it four stars because the guys at work enjoyed them imensly. I made my own frosting so that I could incorporate peanut butter into it to complement the banana. Overall a good recipe.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. I never had a chance to put frosting on them.  They were gone in no time.

The cake is really good. I made homemade cream cheese frosting for it and I actually didn't care for it with the banana cake. I have always made this with another frosting recipe that's more like a buttercream and it actually uses a raw egg in it. I prefer that frosting with the cake better. Don't get me wrong I LOVE cream cheese frosting...with pumpkin bars!

So good! I didn't have white sugar so I used brown, I didn't have sour cream so I used light vanilla yogurt. I used a 13x9 pan, came out fine. I had a container of store bought cream cheese frosting on hand and it made it a snap. Also, my bananas weren't as ripe as I had wanted so I mircowaved them for 15 seconds to soften them up a bit. Easy recipe & delicious!

These were out of this world.   First time making banana bars as I have always just made bread and I don't know if I can go back now!   Totally moist - to die for.  I forgot to mash the bananas ahead of time but mine were really really overly ripe so I just threw in 3 medium sized and mixed for a bit longer.  Will definitely be making this again!

I had ripe bananas I needed to use up and wanted to try something other than regula rol' banana bread - and am I ever glad I did! These are delicious! I made them with the whipped cream cheese frosting as suggested and was very impressed! Why would you use store bought icing if you don't have to??

Wow!  I was not expecting this to be sooooo fabulous.  I cut the sugar to 1 c., used light sour cream and made homemade cream cheese frosting with fat-free cream cheese. It was an absolute hit!  Will make again and again...

I just made a batch of these for a dinner party for a friend. My hubby and I are on a dietbut they looked so temting we decided to split one. OMG!!! These are to die for!!! They were so moist and delicious. I used my own cream cheese icing recipe that uses 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of orange extract. The mild orange flavor complemented these nicely. Too easy and too delicious not to make!

My husband and I agreed this was a great recipe, but I wouldn't call them bars, it's a dense cake. I was expecting that though after reading the reviews and was looking to make a cake rather than bars anyway. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes and it came out very moist with plenty of banana flavor (I used 3 large bananas). I made Cream Cheese Frosting II (halved the recipe) from this site to ice the cake. The frosting was excellent. This cake would also be very good without frosting. I will make this recipe again.

We loved this dessert. I used a 9x13 pan, so they seemed a little more like a cake to me. I wanted something different then bannana bread to use up over-ripe bannanas. These are great.

I found this recipe when searching for something different to make with left over bananas and it has become a household favourite. Have shared it with family who simply couldn't get enough of them.

WOW!! I have made these bars twice and they turned out excellent both times. Brought them to work yesterday and received so many compliments; everyone loved them. I brought home an empty pan and barely got to taste them for myself!!I do add 1 tsp cinnamon as suggested by some reviewers as well as Cream Cheese II frosting recipe on this site, then top with chopped walnuts. I also use the jelly roll pan, not a 9X13. These are by far the best banana bars I've ever tasted!!!

I made this in a 9X13 cake pan,  The only alterations I made was that I made my own maple frosting for them since I didn't have cream cheese.  OMGoodness so delish!  This has replaced my mom's recipe!

I have this exact same recipe and it really is amazing.  It is perfect for anytime, baby showers, etc.  It is so moist and tasty! Everyone goes crazy when I make it.  I do have a cream cheese frosting that came with my recipe:
1 package of cream cheese (8 oz)
1/2 cu butter or marg. softened
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 3/4 to 4 cups confectioners' sugar
I just prefer homemade frosting to store bought.

Just finished baking these bars and WOW!  They are wonderful.  So light and moist. I did put mine in a 9x13-inch pan and baked them 30 minutes.  They came out perfect.  Will be making these a lot.  The best by far!  Thanks!

I have made these many times and they are quite good! 
Everyone is always suprised how good these really are...I think maybe they are expecting them to taste like ordinary dry banana bread...or maybe have an artificial banana taste. It's just the opposite....moist.rich and flavorful.

I always use home made crean cheese icing. These are good for an easy desert or for make and take.

I have used bananas that I had frozen (getting over ripe) it worked fine.

Wow! These are great! They are very moist and chewy like the title states. I was pleasantly surprised on how good these are. I don't like frosting so I made a peanut butter glaze instead using 2/3 cup of powered sugar, 4 teaspoons of water and a tablespoon of peanut butter. Nothing goes better with bananas than peanut butter. Make this for your next get-together, they will be a hit!

I made this recipe last night and it was incredibly easy.  I used an 11x16 pan, about 1 1/2 c of mashed banana and baked them for just 20 minutes.  I frosted them with a homemade vanilla butter frosting.  The texture is great, very moist.  Next time I will increase the bananas to 2 cups, and bake them about 2 minutes longer, as they were slightly doughy in the center.  I will also apply a thinner layer of frosting , as it does tend to overpower the flavor in the bars.  If you have ripe bananas and need to bake something in a hurry, this one is a keeper!

Wonderful way to use up overripe bananas.  I used them for my preschool class for valentines day so I cut them using a heart shaped cookie cutter and used red sprinkles to make them festive. Delicious, slightly sweet thanks to the frosting (which is to die for). Highly recommended!

This recipe is excellent. The only thing I added was a dash or so of cinnamon. I made my own cream cheese frosting from the website. It was the one that didn't have butter in it. I would say use a different frosting recipe as that one was so so at best. But this bar is more like a cake as other reviewers have commented but it is SUPERB! Very moist and delish! I prepared in a 13 x 9 for right about 39 minutes. Cooled and frosted and it was awesome. You could definitely get away without any frosting at all!!! Next time maybe I will add chocolate chips and then just sprinkle with powdered sugar! YUMMY!

Very delicious, foolproof way to use up over rippened bananas.  Decreased sugar to 1 cup, used all 4 bananas I had and only 1 egg as that was all I had. Used 9X13 pan. Turned out great, as I said foolproof.

I was getting tired of just using my going bananas for banana bread.  I was looking for something a little different.  And anything with cream cheese frosting has to be good!!  These were easy  to make and also very good.  I used half butter and half applesauce, half sour cream and half yougrt (because that is what I had) and I frosted them with Chocolate Cheese Frosting.  I loved the chocolate with the banana.  I thought they made nice bars.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was given an entire box of bananas, so I was in desperate need of some new banana recipes to help me use them all up. I stumbled across this one, and it is fantastic! They are very moist and go perfectly with the cream cheese frosting. I made the Cream Cheese Frosting II, since I don't care for store-bought frostings. The second time I made them, I added approx. 1/4 (or to taste) cocoa powder and  approx. 1/2 cup chocolate chips and eliminated the frosting. Those were also quite delicious. Definitely a winner recipe that everyone loved and keeps asking about!

Very good recipe.  I used three ripe bananas and my own cream cheese frosting (8 oz. cream cheese, 4 tbsp. butter, 1 1/2 c. confec. sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract).  Wow!  They are incredible and VERY moist.  This is a great way to use up over-ripe bananas.  I think this would make a good banana bread loaf as well.

These are basically like a dense banana bread with frosting. I used three very ripe bananas which came to a little more than the 1 cup called for. I topped them with a very thin layer of Pillsbury cream cheese frosting and sprinkled finely chopped walnuts and Nestle mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on top. Looked great and tasted fabulous!

Oh my gosh, how many stars can I give this recipe?  It was super easy and very delicious.  Everyone at work loved it.  I didn't have a jelly roll pan so I used the same size cake pan and it worked out great, and I used almost 3 bananas.  I also took other readers advice and made my own cream cheese frosting.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Delta!

Wowza!  I'm not really a cake fan, but these were a winner at our house! I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8.  I used Greek yogurt, not sour cream, and made my own cream cheese frosting.  Move over, banana quick bread, there's a new 'naner in town!

I followed recipe EXACTLY as written and it was PERFECT!! Family raved about them and said they're better than banana nut bread. Will make again. For the icing part I made homemade buttercream from this site.

The bars were edible but just didn't taste good. I made them per the recipe and used cream cheese frosting but they weren't to anyone's liking. I think brown instead of white sugar along with some cinnamon might make this better. Using a semi-sweet and fluffy chocolate frosting would probably have worked better than the cream cheese. Lastly the cook time is too short, I needed another 8-10 min.

I also used a 9x13 and ended up cooking it 7 minutes longer than stated above. I also only used a cup of sugar instead of a cup and a half, but those two things aside I followed the recipe as stated and it. was. WONDERFUL. (and baking is NOT my forte!) Will definitely keep this!

This recipe was very moist and yummy! It wasn't overly banana-y ... which is great because we're not a big banana family. We love the fruit, but find most recipes for banana flavoring lacking. Most include banana or vanilla pudding and we try to stay away from such fatty choices. This one was perfect. I used margarine (instead of butter) and low-fat sour cream to cut down on the calories and fat and neither substitution altered the recipe.

This recipe is so good.  I use a 9x13 inch pan or in a muffin pan  and I add walnuts sometimes too.  Either way it's a hit.  Last time I made them i made them as muffins and made my own cream cheese frosting and my guests couldn't get enough of them.  I like "cake" recipes that do not use a boxed brand, not trying to be snobby just that I don't want the ingredients I can't pronounce and don't want hydrogenated oils.  
Cream cheese frosting:
1 stick butter softened
1 block of cream cheese softened
1lb powdered sugar
Mix until smooth -  this makes a lot - more than you need but sometimes I like a lot if icing anyway!  :)
Try this recipe!

These a so wonderful, and everyone always ooh's and aah's when they eat these.  This time I tried a different recipe for the frosting and everyone was wondering what made it so fluffy. I mixed one softened 8 oz cream cheese with 1/4 c, softened butter, beat till creamy, gradually add 1 c. confectioners suger, beat till smooth. Add 1-8oz whipped topping, like coolwhip,thawed, and beat to combine.  And I like to add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the bars. Yummy!

I was looking to get rid of some overripe bananas, and gave this a try.  I did as one of the other reviews mentioned, and cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  I used four bananas, and baked it in a 9x13" pan for about 35 minutes.  I used chocolate frosting, and topped it with sprinkles.  These are fantastic!  I accidently left them out overnight, uncovered, and they are still just as moist today.  I highly recommend this recipe!

A great way to make a legit dessert out of those mushy bananas i always have occupying my counter space or freezer. You can only make banana bread so many times a month... I used whipped cream cream cheese frosting instead of what the recipe said, and it was so good!

My 17 year old son would give these 10 stars if he could.  This "cake" was so good I think he and I ate almost all of it within the first two days all by ourselves.  My daughter and husband hardly got a piece each.  I loved it with the cream cheese frosting but my son liked it better just plain so I only frosted my pieces.  

He's been begging me to make it again, and has even gone so far as to put a note on my current bunch of bananas saying "make banana cake out of me"!

My only issue was that the center was a little bit less cooked (cooked but a little wet on top) than the outside so I will keep the next one in as long as I can without the edges getting too brown.

Very yummy, moist and delicious.  These bars are very easy to make, and are very delicious too.  I used homemade cream cheese frosting.  My family could not stop eating these, so I quickly froze some for another day.  Definitely try these.

Loved this recipe.  I made them into cupcakes instead of bars and my family love them.  My boys prefer no frosting and the girls enjoy it, so making them into cupcakes worked very well!

These turned out great! I used whole wheat flour, half of the sugar and plain yogurt...they are very moist and really don't need any frosting....more like a cake, rather than a "bar"...greased a cake pan, baked for 30 min. at 350 and they are wonderful! Will make again!

These are Very good.  I did however substitute splenda for regular sugar.  I used regular frosting and they were delicious.  I think I will try the splenda/sugar mix next time.

These bars are simply phenomenal! I’ve made these a good number of times since first trying them a few months ago. The two things I did differently was to add chopped walnuts per family requests, and used 3 ripe bananas. Despite the fact that 3 bananas gives more than a cup, it is unnecessary to increase any dry ingredients to compensate for the extra moisture. In fact it works in the bars benenfit both in flavor and moisture.  As recommended by another reviewer, I made the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting by Tom. Between the lightness of the bars and the delicate frosting these bars are truly to die for!

Brought these to work today and they are disappearing quick. They are delicious. I added a little cinnamon to mine and halved the icing recipe so they just had a glaze on them. Moist and delicious. A good way to clear the freezer from bananas that I have saved before going bad.

Very good, but very dense.  If you make it any thicker than in a jelly roll pan you have way too much cake. It would make fabulous banana bread.

I made this for a graduation party, and followed the recipe exactly, I think this dessert was gone even before the meal was over, and I made it in a 10x15 jellyroll pan!!!  I was short on time, but next time I think I will make my own frosting!

This is so good! I had to improvise a bit, as I was out of vanilla extract, so I used almond instead. And I had to use a larger pan and increased the cooking time. Anyhoo, this is one soft, moist, delicious recipe. P.S. - you don't need to frost them. They are awesome plain!

I was really tired of making the Banana nut bread and banana crumb muffins etc and was looking for something simple and quick  with fewer ingredients. This fit the bill and turned out to be excellent.Thanks Laura Jean for suggesting ..." turn off the computer and go and make it! ":) I sprinted to the kitchen!

Since my jelly roll pan is a darker color, I reduced the baking temp to 325 degrees and it came out perfect at 20 minutes.  These were nice and moist but the family did not eat them as well as I hoped.

I made this recipe just as is and it turned out great!
They were very moist and I used a cream cheese frosting that I picked up off this site.
I brang the bars into work the next day and they were literally gone in 5 minutes!
I would highly recommend trying these!

Wow, this was awesome.  Very moist, but light and fluffy too.  I liked the idea of baking it in the 10x15 jellyroll pan.  I didn't have cream cheese frosting, so I topped it with some whipped buttercream.  I can only imagine what it would be like with the cream cheese frosting.  I will be making this again for sure.  Thanks!

This was a very moist, flavorful recipe.  I made in 2 round 8"cake  pans and frosted with a chocolate glaze.  I shared this with my parents who also raved over it.  While I use canned frosting in an "emergency", this deserves a great homemade frosting or glaze!  I will be definitely making this again!!

These were amazing!!! I planned on not having any but once I took them to work and people were going back for seconds (and thirds) I had to try one. My bars came out super light and fluffy with just enough cream cheese frosting. If I could give 10 stars, I would!

I attempted to make a low-fat version of this recipe, and it still turned out delicious.  I used low-fat butter (the Kroger brand) and reduced fat sour cream.  I also cut out approximately 1/3 cup of the sugar.  Nevertheless, the cake turned out moist and delicious.

NUMMY!!  These turned out to be more of a cake than a bar.  I used a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 minutes.  I added walnut pieces, made my own cream cheese frosting and sprinkled with more walnut pieces.  I got many compliments.  I will definately be making these again very soon!

This recipe is incredible.  I've had so many requests for the recipe I know it by heart.  I use a 10 x 17 cookie sheet with a lip - it fits perfectly.  Also use a cream cheese frosting from this site 8 oz cream cheese 1 stick  butter 1 c sifted powdered sugar and 1/2 t vanilla - perfect amount for the bars

We made 2 batches, one with half whole wheat flour and the other just as the recipe was written. Family thought they were disappointing cake. We all preferred the Banana Oatmeal Drop Cookies.

These are terrific - very moist and lots of banana flavor.  I subbed FF greek yogurt for the sour cream and used a homemade cream cheese frosting.  My son-in-law couldn't stop eating them.  He said they reminded him of a banana cheesecake he had eaten once.  Yum.

These were awesome.  I took them to a football pep rally and the ladies in the kitchen tried them and decided to hide them in the back for coaches and themselves.  I've had several emails asking for the recipes.   I subbed ff yogurt for the sour cream and used white whole wheat flour and homemade cream cheese frosting.  SOOOOOOO good!

I made these for a "healthy" potluck at work (horrible idea... people either didn't participate b/c they couldn't think of anything, or they brought something that just "sounded" healthy-like me!).  They didn't *really* fit the theme, but they were wonderful!  Thanks Deltaj! :)

First let me just say it would be a crime to ice these with store bought icing! Wonderful moist cake with the perfect banana flavor. Very easy to execute. Served for dinner with friends and it was a big hit! We will definitely make these again! Even my very picky brother loved them and ate three! This is also very kid friendly. My son loved mashing the bananas. As a mom who loves to bake I really enjoy recipes that are fun to do together.

These are somewhere between a cake and a bread and are AMAZING! I probably ended up with 1.5 cups of mashed bananas, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. As suggested by another reviewer, I iced with the whipped cream cream cheese icing (also found on allrecipes), and it worked wonderfully!

These were easy to make and yummy! I used homemade cream cheese frosting--if you're going to make something from scratch, why slather fake stuff on top? They're more like cake than a bar, and they taste better chilled.

I gave these bars 5 stars, and they deserve it because me and my husband ate a whole pan! We didn't even leave any for the kids! Yes I am making a second batch right now for the kids. I hope they make it this time lol.

Amazing! Came out soooooo moist...I actually ended up eating 1/3 of the 9x13 pan (that could be where the extra poundage came on), they were amazing. Followed the recipe exactly! Used Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting (from this site) on top. Read the first review of the frosting, that will help it turn out right.

These were pretty good and easy to make. Very similar to banana bread in a cake like form.

Really good - a very reliable recipe for a delicious cake.  Not sure why it's called a bar but who cares - it's GOOD.  Made this several times.  Last time I made 1-1/2 times the recipe and it was the perfect amount of batter for my 11x15" Wilton cake pan - which serves 40 guests. Frost it with real cream cheese icing because it's worth it.  Keeps well in the fridge so you can make it a day ahead for sure.

These are so so good. Taste just like Grandma used to make. I took the 'whipped cream cheese frosting' recipe I found on this site and used that to frost the bars and it was fabulous! I will be making these over and over again!

OMG Wow, really Good and easy peasy! I was wondering why there was no cinnamon in it and found out as I am eating it while I am typing, that it doesn't need it. Great flavor:)  Thanks Delta, I will make these again for sure:>)

I really don't feel these bars need frosting at all, so I just didn't frost mine.  I could, but why add more sweetness when they are moist and sweet all by themselves?  I subbed plain yogurt for sour cream, which I don't have.  Turned out perfectly.  I used a 9 x 13 pan instead of a jelly roll pan and they took about 20 min longer as a result.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious.  I thought they would have tasted better with butter cream frosting though instead of cream cheese frosting.  They turned out nice and moist but still dense at the same time.  I will make them again sometime.  Thank you!

Wow, these were really really good!  I decided to try this to use up some bananas (I didn't feel like making banana bread), and it was fantastic!  It made a huge pan, so I took them to work and they pretty much were gone by the end of the day - everyone loved them!  The recipe called for using canned cream cheese frosting, but I couldn't bring myself to do it!  Instead I frosted them with an outstanding cream cheese frosting recipe from this site (Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting) - yummy!

These are sooo good!  This is the banana cake recipe I have been craving.  I used light sour cream, three bananas (based on other suggestions), baked in a 9x13 glass dish for approx 40 minutes (started checking at 30 minutes), and topped with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this website as suggested (used 1/3 less fat cream cheese).  And of course, refrigerate.  Made this again last night for the second week in a row, at hubby's request (who isn't a banana person!).

These are incredible.  I used 2.5 bananas. I made them in a 9x13 pan and increased the cooking time by 5 minutes.  I will be making these again.

Update: These are one of my go-to recipes for quick easy dessert.   I now use yogurt (greek or even plain regular yogurt) instead of sour cream.  The flavor and moistness is exactly the same.  I also only use 1/2 can of frosting.

Wonderful...so soft and moist, I had a hard time keeping my hands off of them! I did change one thing, I made my own cream cheese frosting :    * 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick), room temperature     * 8 oz of Philly cream cheese (1 package), room temperature     * 2 - 3 cups of powdered sugar     * 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract  With an electric mixer, mix the butter and cream cheese together, about 3 minutes on medium speed until very smooth. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure even mixing.  Add the vanilla extract and mix. Slowly add the powdered sugar. Keep adding until you get to desired sweetness. use less sugar if you like more of a cheese flavor or more sugar for a sweeter flavor, I add about 1/4 cup of sugar at a time until I get the flavor just right!

The bars are great! I made them exactly as it says, and the only form of criticism I can offer, the next time I make it, I will use banana pudding/cool whip frosting. The cream cheese frosting was too sweet for me~BUT that is just me!

Fabulous--Better than banana bread any day! I only used 1 c. of sugar since that was all I had...don't miss the rest.  Although it would be great without frosting, I had leftover cream cheese frosting from the last time I made "Clone of a Cinnabon" rolls.  It's all we can do to stop at 1 slice!

These were really great and moist.  To me, they were a lot more interesting than regular banana bread.  Per recommendations I used 3 bananas and I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting recipe from this site.

Excellent! I can't stop eating them. My husband suggested nuts in the bars or on top of the frosting, but I liked them plain just fine! I did use lowfat, plain yogurt instead of sour cream and they are moist and delicious.

I am never good at baking as I'm not a precise person, but I took the courage to make this two days ago for my family . Will be making it again today for a friend! It took almost 30-35 min for me instead of 25 to turn brown and passed the toothpick test. Not sure if it's because I kept taking it out to check when it passed the 25min mark. Well this recipe is simple and delicious for people like me. Sure boosted my confidence in baking!

These are so good. I altered the recipe to 1C. brown sugar and 1.5C. all purpose flour plus 1/2C. Whole wheat flour. I baked it in a 9x13 glass pan for 28 minutes. When cooled, I just topped it with powdered sugar. It really does not need icing. It's perfect

Pretty good.  I put a brown streusel topping on before baking and it came out like a banana coffee cake.  A nice alternative for the icing.

These are delicious!  I frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II (1/2 the recipe) from this site and it's a perfect match.  I garnished the top with chopped walnuts.  Like other reviewers I also used a 9x13 pan, and baked for about 30 minutes.  This was such a nice twist on regular banana bread, and turns it into a decadent, moist cake.

This will become my standard banana cake recipe! I delayed adding the sour cream until the end, with the bananas - then I folded in both, gently. The texture of the cake was almost CREAMY when it came out of the oven!

Oh my, this was good. I was tired of banana bread and muffins, and these are another great way to use up bananas.
Its more like a cake than bars though?
I used a 9x13 glass baking dish, and they were great. (embarassing, but I had to look up what a jelly roll pan was :)

This recipie is a great alternative to use over ripe bananas on.  Try it with an orange cream cheese frosting: add orange juice/grated peel.  The flavors of banana and orange make it simply irrisistable.

Moist, tasty and even relatively low in fat and calories.  This recipe even turned out after I forgot my salt and vanilla!!  

I did make some mods to lower fat and calories a bit more, and because I was low on some ingredients.  I did half sour cream and half yogurt, because I didn't have the full amount of sour cream.  Used egg beaters instead of eggs, and subbed half applesauce some of the butter.  I didn't have cream cheese frosting on hand, nor the ingredients to make any, so  I used caramel frosting.  Delicious!

This definately will become a common item in my house! These are fantastic. I agree they are more cake than bar, but all the same still yummy! I didn't use canned frosting, I made my own cream cheese frosting from here and turned out great. Froze 1/2 of the pan (did use a jelly roll pan) cause it made much more than we could've eaten before they went bad! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

Really great. I used 3 very overripe bananas (that's what I had) and made the icing from the other banana bar recipe to make it extra banana-y. Mine turned out more like a cake, but that could be because I used a 9x13 pan. Very moist and delicious!

I almost bypassed this recipe in search of something chocolatey.  I'm so glad I gave this a try because it's now going into my favorites!  Baked in a 13X9 for 30 minutes, I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter.  It baked up beautifully - no burnt edges,etc.  Once these were cooled, I frosted with the Cream Cheese Frosting I recipe from this site.  I've already eaten 4 pieces!  Better get these into work before the pan is all gone.  :/

Very good.  We ate it plain.  A good recipes to use up leftover bananaa.  Quick tip.  When you have surplus bananas that won't be eaten, stick them in the freezer.  The skins will turn dark brown.  When you need bananas for a recipes, take what you need out of the freezer & defrost in the refrigerator or slowly in the microwave.  Peel open and the banana will slip out - it won't look good but will taste fine in baked goods.

These came out great! I put in plain yogurt instead of the sour cream, and used three large bananas, so it took a little longer to bake, but the result was delicious. Also good if you throw some finely chopped walnuts in the mix or sprinkle them on top. Or top with homemade cream cheese frosting (esp. good with a small amount of lemon zest, lemon juice, or both!)

Very Yummy!  So moist.  I had to use a 9x13 pan, since I didn't have jelly roll size---so the bars turned out more like a banana cake.  I also made the Cream Cheese II Frosting that was suggested by many other previous posters (I only made 1/2 the amount of frosting & I think it was more then enough for this recipe).

I made this recipe for a group of small children. I was looking for something yummy and chocolate free. This was perfect, I used the cream cheese frosting recipe posted by a previous reviewer. Together it was bliss. All of the children (even the picky ones) wanted more! Thanks Delta for sharing such a great recipe!

I rarely change a recipe, but wrote that they nibbled a bunch before frosting.  So instead of frosting, I decided to sprinkle chopped walnuts and granulated brown sugar on top just before baking. Also, I used 3 small bananas and a 13x9 glass baking dish instead of  a jellyroll pan since I don't have one.  I baked it for 30 mins.  I ended up with a wonderfully moist banana "cake" with a brown sugar crunch top.  I will never make standard banana bread again!

The reviewers that described the bars as "cake like" probably overmixed the dry ingredients. Mine came out like bars and slightly chewy, even more bar like over night. I made a mascarpone frosting with mascarpone cheese, heavy whipping cream, sugar and vanilla.

These were very easy.  I thought the frosting was a little gritty, but the hubby said he liked that.  I think next time I will use a can of cream cheese frosting...making it even easier!  UPDATE:  I think I made the previous review on the wrong one.  These were good, but definitely not what I consider a bar....more like a cake.

Simple recipe, but the results are delicious.  Our whole family loves them.  First time I made them as directed in a 10x15 pan, but after that I made them in two 8x8 pans.

I used Dunkin Hines Buttercream icing instead of cream cheese and it turned out really good. I also used a little more banana than called for since I had a bunch to use up.  I only made half the recipe, so I put it in a square pan.  Turned out more like a cake than a bar, but still really good.

I doubled the recipe and made 2 9x13 pans.  I frosted one to take to work and left the other one un-frosted.  My 12 yr old son started devouring the unfrosted bars and exclaimed "This is better than your banana bread mom!"  Excellent hit at work also!!  I didn't have cream cheese frosting, but had a container of vanilla frosting and it was just as yummy!!  I saved the recipe and plan to work with it to make muffins and bread....it was SO moist and had excellent flavor (I did add a couple extra bananas).

Yum! These were great! Not quite as dense as banana bread but with a very similar flavor. I used two large bananas (more like 1½ cups total) and the bars needed to bake for more like 30 minutes, but it may have been my oven. Usually it's pretty close, time-wise... Oh, well. I also omitted the canned frosting and made more of a cream cheese glaze (4 oz softened cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 TBS milk and adding more milk to make a good spreading or drizzling consistency). I also sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. The whole family enjoyed. Thanks, Delta! Your recipe is a keeper. :)

I read the reviews before I made this and took the advice of a few people to alter the recipe: I used 1/4 c butter and 3.9 oz applesauce, 1/2 c sugar, 6 oz plain fat free yogart, 2 eggs, 1 c wheat flour, 1 c AP flour, 1 ts b soda and 3 ripe bananas. I also included 1/2 walnuts because we always add walnuts to banana recipes. It turned out great. My jelly roll pan yielded 32 bars at 80 calories a piece. Thanks for the new idea for ripe bananas. I am making this for my husbands coworkers, but keeping the original recipe (since I am not eating it) and adding chocolate chips.

This was an easy and yummy recipe, although it was more cake-like than I expected.  I've made it many times, sometimes throwing in chocolate chips.  I always replace the sour cream with non-fat plain yogurt.

This year for the 4th of July, I used blueberries and strawberries to decorate it like a flag.  I also use the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese recipe for the frosting (1/2 the frosting recipe is just right).

Yum!  This recipe is definitely a keeper! However, it is more like banana cake--not banana bars.  If moist banana cake with frosting sounds good to you, try this recipe!

These are excellent.  This comes out more like cake rather than bars.  It makes a huge amount.  The Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this web-site is delicious with it.

These are exquisite-dense banana flavor and very moist. Recipe makes a great number of bars using the jelly roll size pan-be prepared to box up some for the neighbors or office bunch! I did have to cook them 2-3 minutes longer than listed.
Be sure to finish them off with the heavenly whipped cream cheese frosting, also on this site-it is lighter than the tradional versions you find and fits so nicely with this bar. The office staff couldn't get enough of them!

This was the best banana anything recipe I've made. I used three medium bananas, and it was super moist. Even when kept in the fridge covered, it maintained its moisture. The whipped cream cream cheese frosting was quite yummy, except making just half of the recipe will be enough to spread a perfect thin layer. Chopped  walnuts or milk chocolate shavings on top is highly recommended.

I made these for my son's pre-school Christmas party.  Everyone (kids and adults) LOVED them!  I frosted them with white icing since I wasn't sure if kids would go for cream cheese.  Also, I didn't wrap them real tight because they are very, very moist and I was afraid they would get soggy.  This is DEF a keeper :)

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have any problems with bars being too dry.  I used 3 medium sized bananas (I didn't measure to make sure it was 1 cup)--it was probably more than 1 cup, but felt it would make them more moist and a stronger banana flavor.  This is a family keeper recipe!!!

Didn't look like much in the pan, but tastes great! So light and fluffy, I didn't even use the frosting! Thanks a bunch! By the way, I used 3 medium sized bananas.

All The girls at work asked for the recipe, some took some home to their hubbys, and what was left I shoved into my mouth!!! LOVED it and will definitely make again!!!

Oh my goodness, was this ever delicious! Other than cutting the sugar back to 1 rounded cup and adding a bit more banana, I made it as directed. Followed the suggestions of serving it cold and it was unbelievable how good it was. I made my own peanut butter frosting, because I don't care for the taste of canned frostings. So good and so easy!! I'll be making this one often.

These are sooooo addicting! These did not last long in our house, I had them in the morning with coffee, and that night for dessert. Make a homemade cream cheese frosting - don't use a store bought one! I will definitely be making these again.

Made them almost exactly as stated. I used about 3/4 cup of sour cream and about 1 and 1/2 c mashes bananas. I also subbed half brown sugar and included about 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I baked them at 350 in convection oven for about12 min and they were perfectly done. I used the whipped cream cream cheese frosting tinted yellow and they are very good. My kids loved them! Might add nuts next time. Very good!

These bars came out so light and fluffy and so different from regular banana bread.  I used fat free plain yogurt, a bit less sugar, and a store bought chocolate frosting.  Next time I'd skip the frosting these bars are great without.

Great recipe...fluffy and moist cake!  I did replace 1/2 of the sour cream with applesauce, used a 1/4 c less sugar,  and added 2 T wheat germ to pump up the healthy.  Delicious!  Also, used a the highest rated cream cheese frosting off allrecipes too...yum!

We used this recipe with the Best Buttercream Frosting Recipe by Jennifer.  It was better than eating buttered banana bread.  It was extremely delicious.

Making these for the 2nd time already! Wow, they are so moist and good!! I use regular butter cream frosting for them. It's almost easier to make butter cream than it would be to go to the store and buy it. :o)

The cake was super easy and yummy.  Very moist.  I followed the directions of other reviewers and only used 1 cup of sugar and 4 small bananas.  Also used the peanut butter chocolate frosting recipe..and it was great.  Also, thing this would be SUPER with cream cheese frosting.

I have been using this recipe since 2005!  It is THE BEST!  I never take it somewhere with out getting asked for the recipe.  I bake it in a 9 x 13 casserole pan, and make my own cream cheese frosting if I have time.  I also have made it with whole wheat flour, and it is marvelous!  Enjoy!

This was delicious!  I was subscribed to Taste of Home's Healthy Cooking, and in one of the issues there was a healthy recipe for this.  This one was so much more moist though.  I used red. fat vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and only used 1 c sugar like another reviewer suggested.  Also, I made a red. fat cream cheese icing and it was delicious on this.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe deltaj!

These are fantastic!  I will use a different cream cheese frosting.  I like to make my own.  But the cake turns out soooo moist and the snack size is perfect to take anywhere.  I'll share this recipe with others.

These bars are the best EVER! I did not use the store frosting, i used a basic powdered sugar frosting and they were fantastic. Could not get enough of them! I think especially for summer that the cream cheese frosting would be a little heavy. I didn't want to take away from the banana flavor! The banana flavor is sooo good and very fragrant!

Made recipe exactly as printed and it was amazing.  I thought my husband would eat it at one seating but he had to fight me for it!  Used the 10 x 15 inch jelly roll pan and baked for 27 minutes - it was perfect.  Even the store bought cream cheese frosting was very good on it.  Used 4 small to medium bananas and it was not too much, it was probably 1 1/2 to 2 cups.   Definitely a keeper recipe to make again and again...very easy!!!

These had good flavor and were very moist.  I used chocolate frosting on the top.... but if I made it again I would definitely use a cream cheese frosting.  It was a great alternative to banana bread for using up extremely ripe bananas. :)

Soooo yummy. Definitely don't make these when you're on a diet like me! They're too tempting!  I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and didn't miss any sweetness at all. These were so moist and perfect really. I do agree with other users that store bought frosting would be a tragedy. Find a good one on here, and you're set!!

Very good flavor and the recipe really makes a huge pan.  My ony complaint is that they were really cake-like moist and not really a bar consistency.  I guess I was expecting something a little different.  Mind you the pan is almost empy.....

I rate this 3 stars for 2 reasons: 1) had to cook quite a bit longer than stated. This could be because I didn't have a 10x15 pan but used a 9x13 pan. My knife came out clean in the end but it was still pretty mushy soft on the bottom. I cooked about 15 minutes extra at 4-5 minute intervals. 2) I love bananas but even using 2 bananas this was way too much flavor for me.  The recipe was extremely easy and fast to make which is a plus. I made our own cream cheese frosting off this site and it was great. Overall a good recipe. Just not a keeper for us.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some bananas and came across this one.  I figured it looked easy enough and boy was that right!  And, not only easy but incredibly tasty!  The bars turned out very moist.  I made my own cream cheese frosting to top them with and also sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top.  These are definitely winners!

These were really good!  I added a touch of cinnamon to the bars before baking and used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting  from this website and substituted Cool Whip for the whipping cream.  They turned out phenomenal!

I made these because I saw the picture and they were fabulous.  I used store bought cream cheese frosting and a little more banana then called for but they were fabulous.  I froze the left overs in wax paper and just ate one today. Still delicious.

I followed directions and made in a jelly roll pan- the recipe tasted delicious, but resemble a thin piece of cake rather than a "bar."  So, next time I will make in 9x13 or in cupcake form. I added chocolate chips into batter and once baked, frosted with peanut butter icing (found on this website).  It satisfied all of my cravings in one bite- sweet, salty, delicious!

Good, basic recipe.  Unlike other reviewers, I used a larger pan--a 12x17 since I didn't have a 10x15.  It worked just fine, baked for about 15 minutes.  Definitely a lighter, cakier texture than I was expecting.  But still good.  I used 3 large bananas.

Great & super easy!  My husband raved about them & said he could have ate the whole pan.  I used 3 ripe bananas & did a homemade cream cheese frosting.  Will definitely keep as a favorite recipe!  Was going to try freezing some (as another review stated) but don't think there will be any leftovers from this pan!!

These were good. A great alternative to plain old banana bread when you have ripe bananas. Made them in a 9x13 dish and once cooled I frosted them with homemade cream cheese frosting that I added some peanut butter to. Yum. Peanut butter and bananas. Delicious. Thanks for a good recipe!

Best banana cake recipe I've tried!  Really doesn't need a lot of frosting, the cake is so good on it's own, only a thin layer of cream cheese frosting will do, otherwise you risk over powering the yummy flavor of the bananas. Moist and tasty!

Made to recipe... 'cept used a 13x9- increased bake time...  Totally awesome... basically banana bread with icing....  I used "cream cheese frosting ll" I would not insult a homemade cake with a can frosting... (ok for a quick box mix though!!) Used 4 medium rotting bananas...  very tastey!!  Will add nuts next time....

Very good recipe as is, but here are some ways to make it as yummy but healthier. For the 1/2 cup butter, use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce. Cut the 1 1/2 cups sugar to 1 - 1 1/4 cups. For the two cups flour, use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour. 1 cup mashed bananas didn't seem enough, so I used two cups mashed bananas. Everyone raved about how good it was! (also, you can sprinkle on some chopped walnuts or pecans on the finished product!)

Loved this recipe!  Daughters had absolutely no problem eating without any frosting (never got around to making some)  The next time, I did make frosting.  I used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" on this site as other's suggested.  It was delicious, couldn't stop licking the bowl.

Amazing... I had leftover bananas in the freezer and needed to use up some sour cream, and this recipe fit the bill. Made them exactly as stated in the recipe, they are super moist and the flavor is perfect! They are easy to throw together. I did as another reviewer suggested and used The whipped cream cream cheese frosting recipe from this site!

Although the title is a bit misleading because it came out more like a cake than a bar, it was delicious! I decreased the sugar to 1 cup (used brown sugar for a richer flavor), used low fat yogurt (no sour cream) and used half whole wheat flour. I made my own cream cheese frosting using AR's Cream Cheese Frosting II to frost my cake and topped it with chopped macadamia nuts. Do not overbake these! The flavor and texture is better when you leave it in the fridge overnight because it gives it time to develop a more intense banana flavor and hardens a bit so it's more like a bar. Hope this helped.

This was more like a cake then a bar, also I did not think it had enough banana taste.  I also did not buy cream cheese frosting I used the recipe on here called Cream Cheese Frosting II.  I think next time I will try another recipe.

ABSOLUTELY wonderful--don't change a thing when you make these--I usually use 3 bananas for more taste--and then top with the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting! Perfect!

Wonderful recipe!  I have made this many times, and am frequently asked for the recipe. I use a 13x9 baking dish, and the result is definitely cake-like...and very dense and moist.  I generally omit the frosting, and instead add 1c. mini chocolate chips to the batter. It disappears fast!

I've tried other recipes and this one tops them.  I made it as the recipe indicated, then I made another one with banana flavoring instead of vanilla.  I'll stick with the banana flavoring, as it really made a huge difference.  That's a small change, so I'm leaving the recipe at 5 stars!  I also used the cream cheese frosting recipe from this site (and subbed half the vanilla for banana flavoring on that, too!)  VERY GOOD!  This cake is too good to use a canned frosting.

OH my gosh. These are so addicting and VERY good. I made them in a 9x13 pan so they were thicker, just how I like it. They're very cake-like, but for me that's a good thing. I used LORI Q's "Banana Bars" frosting instead, which was a little salty, but was a great compliment to this already-fantastic treat!

I was very dissapointed with these after all the great reviews.  These never did seem to cook up right, staying a little doughy. The best part was the homemade cream cheese frosting I put on these.  Will go back to my own Banana Bar recipe, which never fails me.  Sorry about the poor review.

These are great!  I added blueberries and 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I baked them in a 13x9 inch baking pan for about 40 minutes.  I didn't have sour cream, so I used lowfat plain yogurt instead.  I also used 3 large ripe bananas.  So moist and tender!  I would recommend using "Cream Cheese Frosting II" by JJ from this site.  So much better than canned frosting!

This recipe was Amazing. I agree with the other reviewers that it's not really a bar so much as a cake, but boy is it a Great cake! I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8" square pan same time/temp as recipe. Added a couple small palm fulls of walnuts, and about 1/2 t ground cinnamon, increased the banana slightly because I didn't want to throw any away and they just happened to be odd sized bananas! This recipe really is worthy of a homemade cream cheese frosting so just go ahead and omit that can of packaged stuff and make your own. It was also BF approved, he inhaled a piece in about 60 seconds and promptly declared it's what he wants for his bday cake in a few weeks =)

Wonderful, perfect banana flavor--complemented nicely with HOMEMADE cream cheese frosting. So moist and flavorful, I'm so glad I finally used this recipe! I used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 vanilla yogurt, as it was what I had. Excellent. I cut the bars, then frosted, then cut lines into the frosting (looks prettier...will post photos). For each square, I decorated with some chopped up chocolate chips and walnuts. =) What a fun recipe!

VERY, Very tastey bars. Kind of cake like; but very moist and dense. The only thing I did different was the frosting. I'm not a cream cheese frosting fan! I used the frosting recipe from the White Texas Sheet Cake recipe from this sight. I put it on the bars while hot as directed on the "White Texas" recipe. Sprinkled some chopped pecans on top, too! I used lemon juice to knock down the sweetness in the frosting. Banana cake is always great with the tang of lemon. By the way it only took 20 min. to bake. Any more time and I think it would have made them dry. Watch carefully as in doesn't take long to bake because the pan is shallow.

Very good.  I made a batch and my family (11 of us) had them gone in one day.  They asked for more right away.  I used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site that someone else suggested.  Great combination.  Thanks for sharing.

I used the recipe as a base and made a few changes to it. I only used 1 c. sugar, I substituted the butter for olive oil and I substituted 2 6 oz. strawberry yogert for the sour cream. I got 22 regular size cupcakes out of the batter and baked at 350 for 21 mins. I topped them off with strawberry cream cheese icing and sprinked them with chopped pecans.   1 - 8 oz. tub of strawberry cream cheese (at room temp)  4 tbls butter (at room temp)  1 - tbls vanilla extract  2 - cups of powdered sugar Combine all ingredients and mix until smooth and creamy.

Delicious! I used a 9x13 pan, so it turned out more as cake than bars, but I am not complaining. The cake tastes amazing, and it's so easy! I'll definitely make this again, and perhaps experiment with some spices.

VERY GOOD!  I made these for breakfast for my 3 young(18 mo, 18 mo and 28 mo)children and they loved it.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and used fatfree sour cream.  Cooked in a 9 x 13 for 30 min and drizzled icing over them (1 T ff cream chz, 1/2 T milk and 3 T powered sugar).  They were good!!

This recipe is great!  Very easy and very tasty.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of baking it in a bunt pan (baking for about 40 minutes).  Turned out great and my family loved it!  I think it is sweet enough without the frosty, but my husband says 'no way'!

I made these bars and took them to work (after sampling them at home of course), and they were wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly, and used canned cream cheese frosting, and loved them.  This is a keeper.  Thanks!

I made the bars as written, but used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting from this site instead of canned frosting.  The bars were good but something was definately missing.  I sprinkled chopped walnuts over the icing, and what a difference!  Next time I will add the walnuts to the cake batter.  With the addition of the walnuts, this recipe is a 5.  I also found that the bars tasted even better the next day.

These got a conflicting review in my home, though it may be due to the alterations I made to the recipe.  I cut the sugar in half and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and a 1/4 cup granulated white, and I doubled the bananas to add more banana-flavor.  Instead of doing a frosting (which may be why this recipe gets such great reviews!), I made a caramel-glaze, but I must have made a mistake with the liquid-to-sugar ratio, because it never hardened.  I really liked the lightly sweet, banana-flavor, but my husband didn't care for these at all. I might try these again using the recipe exactly as written.

Very good recipe. I used two almost very ripe bananas. Was afraid that was not enough so I used banana yogurt instead of sour cream. Decreased sugar to 1 cup. Baked for approx. 30 mins. Used a 9 1/2 x 9 1/2 inch square pan. Cake came out great. Not too sweet and very moist. Was good without the frosting. Will try it with frosting later.

I omitted the frosting, and used 1/2 sour cream, half vanilla yogurt. Then I left out the vanilla. Soooo good, especially when topped with the Peanut Butter GLaze from this website.

These bars are very good.  They are great for a picnic, potluck, or somewhere people carry food.  They are very moist and don't crumble when you pick them up.

Awesome recipe!  Only changes I made was to add one more cup of bananas and bake it in a 9x13 pan. (I wanted more of a cake texture) I frosted it with Tom's whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this site and it was a HUGE hit! Thanks deltaj for a delicious recipe!

very good and light.  i used soy sour cream and bananas that were not that ripe(no microwaving as some have suggested) and got wonderful results.  I would add a little less sugar next time! almost too sweet!  Also used sot cream cheese for frosting  -  very nice allthough real cream cheese flavor cannot be beat.

The first time I made these I broiled them instead of baking. Don't try this... The 2nd time I made them, they were just phenomenal. I used 4 ripe bananas and after baking, lightly dusted the tops with confectioners sugar. Really wonderful. I am craving these now!

I ran out of sour cream so I used yogurt like another review suggested and it came out really good.

delish!  I followed the recipe to a T.  I wish they were a little bit more bar cookie-like but they're great as is, more cake than cookie and fluffier than banana bread.  I frosted them with my recipe for cream cheese frosting and shared them at work, where they were quite popular.  sturdy enough to eat without a plate and fork and the recipe makes a ton so they're perfect for sharing!  thanks for posting!

This is a 10 star recipe in my house!  Everyone down to the 19 month old liked this.  I decreased the sugar some and used 2 large bananas.  My family does not like cream cheese frosting (except for me!) so I used a vanilla glaze from this site.  DH said it reminded him of Entenmans Banana cake, high praise.

I was looking for something different to make with my ripe bananas and thought this sounded good. It was good but I think I will stick to my banana bread. It is definitely more of a cake than a bar. The only change I made was I added a cup of chopped walnuts to the batter. I frosted the "bars" w/ a 16 oz. container of Cool Whip mixed w/ a cup of milk and a package of banana creme pudding mix. I enjoyed the frosting more than the cake.

Always a big hit--even my son, who doesn't eat cake unless it's chocolate, loves it! I used a cream cheese frosting on this website instead of the store-bought kind. It was awesome!!

These were excellent! I loved them!! So moist and delicious! Plus, it made a whole pan of delicious treats rather than just a loaf of bread! I cheated and used store bought cream cheese frosting and while it was still good, I know that a home made version will be much better. I also chopped up some nuts and sprinkled them on top of the frosting. DELCIOUS!! I will make these again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe turned out great, but I was disappointed with the recipe overall. It didnt "wow" me the way I thought it would, made me wish I had turned the bananas into banana bread.

If the submitter can enlighten me...I used whole wheat flour and splenda...and the banana taste did not come through AT ALL...and it was as flat as a pancake, which can be explained  by the Splenda.

In my past experiences these two mods did not make that much of a difference!  Please help!

I hope this is better after it sits for a while.  I just made these and without the frosting, I don't think I would be able to eat them.  I don't know what I was expecting, since I have never had banana bars before.  Maybe they are supposed to taste like this!

More like a cake than a bar, but absolutely delicious nonetheless!  Who would have thought that one of my favorite cakes would turn out to be a banana cake.  The Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe on this site complimented this recipe well.

5+++++  I would give this recipe more stars if I could.  I used 4 very ripe bananas.  They were perfectly moist and delicious.  The kids loved them as well.  I used a store bought cream cheese frosting, but next time I will try a recipe from scratch from this site for the frosting.  Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe!!!  Will be making these again!!!

These are really moist and yummy!  They are also very simple and quick to make.  It only took me about 10 minutes to prepare them, which isn't long at all.  I wanted to make some pumpkin bars but didn't have any pumpkin so I decided to look for some kind of alternative and these worked out better than I though.  If I could I would give these more then 5 stars.  I used homemade cream cheese frosting instead of store bought and I think the result was much better.  I am also thinking of selling these at my local farmer's market!  Thanks for sharing this recipe! :D

Great recipe! Mine ended up being more like a banana cake... I used to 9x13 baking dish which I'm sure made the difference. I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter.. will definitely be repeating this recipe!

Pretty darn good. I had 2 ripe bananas and gave it a shot. Followed the recipe exactly but added no frosting. Again, pretty good, just not a total "blow your mind" good recipe. If you like banana bread but want something a little lighter, this is a good bet.

This is basically banana cake, not so much banana bars. Disappointed with the end result as I thought it would be semi-nutritious for my kids.

Wow, is all I can say!  I wanted to try out the new Smart Balance/butter blend for baking, so I did it with these.  I also used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I messed up the order in which you put the ingredients together, but it still seemed to work out wonderfully and taste great!  I frosted these with the Cream Cheese Frosting I from this site.

These Banana Bars were sooooo good. I followed the recipe exactly as it was and used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site - delicious. I took them to a bbq as a desert and they disappeared in two minutes... This really is one great recipe, can't wait to make them again.

These bars are amazing and so easy to make!  I made them in a 9 x 13 pan since I didn't have the larger one called for, but I just baked them a little longer and they were delicious.  This one's a keeper!

These tasted good and disappeared quickly, but I expected a denser texture. It turned out just like a cake.
I frosted with regular frosting instead of cream cheese because I didn't have any.

I'm not a huge banana fan but had some ripe bananas to use up (& I already have 2 loaves of banana bread). So I was looking for something different to make - since I'm not a huge banana fan I thought these were ok. But I brought them to work and everyone RAVED about them and asked for the recipe. I took one of the reviewers suggestion and made the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting for these bars (awesome frosting!!).

These were delicious!  I had three large bananas that I needed to use, so I added all of them. I also added 1 cup of pecan pieces.   These were very moist and had great flavor.  We just cut them in bars and ate them without any frosting.  This will be my banana bar recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

As so many reviews noted that this recipe turned out well baked in a 9x13, I doubled the recipe and baked in the jellyroll pan, for our large family.  It was late at night, so I told the milling crowds that I would frost it in the morning after it cooled.  The ravenous nestlings waited not on ceremony and scooped out generous portions to eat right away, slathered in butter.  This morning, there is not enough left to bother with frosting!  I just had a slice myself, and can definitely pronounce it:  WONDERFUL!

These are delicious and dangerous. I could eat the whole 10 x 13 pan of these. If you love bananas, love cream cheese and love dessert then this is the recipe for you. Even if you don't love all those things you'd probably still love this recipe. This is now my favorite dessert.

very soft! i used small 3 x 5 pans for mini-loaves but i think the crust was a little too big so i will use a wider pan with more surface area next time so the cake is flatter.

Wow. What a luscious cake...and with relatively little effort. Super-moist and slightly creamy due to the addition of sour cream. A nice alternative to banana bread. I made mine exactly according to the instructions, although I upped the banana to 1 1/2 cups. Also, like many other reviewers, I used a 9x13 baking dish and it was perfect after 30 minutes in the oven. Finally, although I'm a huge devotee of cream cheese frosting, I gave it a miss this time around. Just felt it would be too rich. Instead, I made a simple glaze of confectioners sugar, hot water and a T of butter. This added a layer of extra sweetness without being overwhelming. My guests devoured it!! A keeper!

Very moist and delicious.  I didn't have a 9x13" pan so my turned out to be a cake.  I used 2 1/2 bananas.  This is a lot like the Sour Cream Banana Bread recipe from this site.  Thank you.

Yum! Made exactly as directed, except I made the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from All Recipes. Super yummy! I'm serving it for a party tomorrow night, so it's hanging out in the freezer till then. My only small critisism is that it could be a little more moist, but it was still delicious,

These were really tasty, but as written, they don't turn out very bar like. If you like very moist banana bread with frosting on it, you'll like these because that's what they taste like. The only changes I made were to use a 9 x 13 inch pan, cook about 5 minutes longer, and use buttercream frosting because that's what I had on hand. They were *very* sweet/rich with the frosting, so maybe next time, I will use a Cool Whip based frosting (or just Cool Whip by itself.)

Baked this recipe in a jellyroll pan. I only had a small amount of sour cream, so I combined it with cream cheese and wow these are delicious. I also added walnuts and before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled it with a packet of raw sugar and when finished baking this I didn't need any frosting. I think this is a moist and easy recipe to prepare and oh so delicious. Will make this again.

okay, so i'm going against the norm here but I had some problems with this recipe. Maybe the key is to use a jellyroll pan but i don't have one so i used a 9x13, cooked at 350 and after 40 min. the cake was burning around the edges. I took it out and it was still raw in the middle. (maybe it's my oven, i don't know) The flavor was good (we ate the edges, had to throw out the gooey middle)but not much different than a banana bread. Update: so glad i didnt give up on this recipe. This has become one of my most requested desserts. I have solved my issue by using 2 8x8 pans and dropping the oven temp slightly. Fantastic!

Delicious, moist bars/cake.  Do not use frosting out of a can.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from Allrecipes and upped the Confectioner's Sugar to 3 C.  I used a 9 X 13 and cooked it a bit longer.  Will make again and again.

Fantastic Banana flavor! Not to strong but perfect with homemade Cream Cheese Frosting. Have also made these with light sour cream, 1/4 less butter and 1/2 splenda with fantastic results. Thank you for this post, my family really enjoyed these.

These were great and really easy to make.  I accidentally only used 1.5 cups of flour (read the recipe wrong!) but I enjoyed the result - they did not rise as much and are more chewy in texture, which is how I like a dessert bar to be.  My only caution would be to frost them VERY LIGHTLY with the cream cheese frosting, I put too much on and they are a little too sickening-sweet for my tastes.  They'd be great without the frosting, too...I think that is how I will make them next time!

Fantastic.  Easy.  Quick and lasts long if covered in fridge.  There is just something about a chilled cake.  I added a bit over 1/2 t cinnamon.  Yummy!  I did use a can of frosting it was good- might make it better to do a homemade frosting next time.  Would be good with pecans in it as well or walnuts.  It's a keeper recipe!  Thanks!

These turned out great!  Baked in a 9x13 glass casserole dish for 35 minutes; maybe a tad overdone - will take out at 30 minutes next time.  Topped with 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' from this site.  Will definitely be our standby recipe when there are bananas to be used up!

Very good!
I baked this in a 9x13 cake pan and I baked it for 30 mins. 
Excellent flavour! Nice & light. 
I frosted it with 'Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting' from this site.

These were really tasty.  I did sprinkle in nutmeg and cinnamon just because I'm used to those flavors with bananas.  I made homemade cream cheese icing. My son loved the bars but not the icing so I did half with icing and half without. Both were equally delicious.

This recipe is great! I happen to love cake so I didn't mind that they were more like cake than cookie bars ;). My husband is out of town, & I can't wait until he comes home tomorrow night so he can try them (if I don't eat the whole pan before then haha). I used the Cream Cheese I frosting from this site & it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

Prepared exactly as directed. The bars were rich, and tasty.  It may be my imagination but it seemed to taste even better after aging 1 day.

If you think the amount of mashed bananas is critical...Measure them.  I ended up using 3 to equal 1 cup.

This is a great recipe.  I had 4 med. ripe bananas and used them all (1 1/2 cup approx).  Used a 9x13 instead and cooked for 40 minutes.  Perfectly moist and delicious.  Family  loved them.  Will definitely make again.  Going to try with walnuts.

I don't have a jellyroll pan, so I used a 13x9" baking dish.  It took a bit longer to bake, and was a more like a sheet cake than a bar, but delicious anyway.  Topped with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting from allrecipes.

These were quite yummy, not as dense as banana bread but light with a good amount of banana flavor.
I added a bit of cinnamon, and made my own cream cheese frosting - yummy!

Very good use of over ripe bananas...I was getting sick of banana bread and banana muffins.  These baked up like a shallow cake and I made cream cheese frosting to top them. I followed the recipe but only used 8oz cream cheese for the frosting, I thought it was plenty.

Very yummy and moist. The banana flavor is just the right amount. Great new way to use up all those over ripe bananas I have.

Very moist and delicious.  I used store-bought frosting, and they were still great.  If you like bananas you'll love these bars.

These are sooo good!  I added a handful of chocolate chips, and used a peanut butter glaze, but really, I think it would have been better without the glaze.  The suggestion of sprinkling peanut butter chocolate chips on top, or even mixed in, sounds like it would be perfect.  I'll try it that way next time, because there will be many more 'next times' with this recipe!

I LOVE this recipe. Simple, and soooo delicious! I didn't change a thing other than I made my own cream cheese frosting with low fat cream cheese and easy on the sugar.  I will most definitely make this again...and soon!

Fed these to a hungry group of middle school kids and they gobbled them up...no complaints and I received a lot of compliments from them.  I had about 3/4 cup light sour cream so I added 1/4 cup fruit flavored yogurt to make up the difference.  Used three bananas and did not bother to measure it out.  Delish!

Very moist and tasty.  I had to use a 13x9 pan at 30 minutes, but they just come out taller!  They smelled so good baking, that we couldn't wait to eat them.  I don't recommend frosting them before the cake/bars cool completely - frosting melts and  runs.  My new recipe for bananas gone by!

My family loved these.  After biting into one my 10 year old son said "MMMmmmm!  Mom where did you get these??"  I said "I made them" to which he sounded stunned "YOU DID?"

Wonderful recipe, thanks!!

OH MY GOSH!  I just finished making the bars, and it really reminds me of my mom's old recipe for banana bread, but sweeter.  I spread it in a larger jelly roll pan than called for and checked it sooner, so they will probably be thinner than others.  Also, I made the Bourbon Cream Cheese Frosting recipe I found here, and used 2T Crown and 2T Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and this is the way to go for the adults!  Holy Cow, this is going to be a hit at work tomorrow.  If we don't eat it all tonight.

These turned out delicious, although the texture was a lot like sponge cake, and I expected something more substantial.  Of course, this is probably my fault because I couldn´t find sour cream in my town in Peru, so I just used plain yogurt with a little vinagre instead.  Anyway, it didn´t effect the taste, and they were one of the first things to go during our peace corps thanksgiving feast.  I added a bit of cinnamon, and I also made my own cream cheese frosting.

I had 3 VERY ripe bananas and didn't want to make the standard  banana bread so tried this.  Simply fantastic!  Its a sweet banana cake and not really a bar IMO.  I did take another's recommendation the "whipped cream cheese frosting" and was NOT sorry. The frosting is amazing on this cake.  I refridgerated the cake w/ the frosting because it was a little runny but after about an hour, it was ready and gobbled up.  I'll absolutely make this again

i used 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 regular. i also used 1/4 sour cream 3/4 plain yogart. it turned out fantastic. i gave it 4 stars b/c i don't think frosting is needed for these moist bars. i used a family cream cheese frosting, and i feel it took away from the delicate banana cake flavor. super moist even in high altitude!

I made this for a family get together and it was a huge hit! I put vanilla and banana flavoring into the batter. As for the icing I just did the 1/2 crisco shortening 1/2 butter with powdered sugar and I also added vanilla and banana flavoring to that. The frosting had just a hint of banana flavor to it, but not alot.
I also added cinnamon to the batter.
It was moist and delicious. I had to use a 9x13 pan since I didn't have a jellyroll pan.
Huge keeper!

Great taste, more cake like. I added half of a whole nutmeg, ground. I also used 1 c. sugar, and 1/2 c. brown sugar. I really think there's no need for frosting, they taste great!

You can easily cut this recipe in half (use 1 large, ripe banana) and bake in either an 8- or 9-inch square pan for around 20 minutes. A good banana cake recipe - not dry and not gluggy. Just as nice without frosting (the whole pan went in 5 minutes at a recent  soccer tournament).

I love these bars, they are more like cake, but less like banana bread.  I make my own cream cheese frosting, 1 bar cream cheese, 4tbls of butter, 1 1/2 c. confec. sugar.  I also had a few heaping tbls of peanut butter for a great peanut butter frosting.

This is a lovely bar / sheet cake recipe.  Very simple to make.  I recommend using a hand mixer (rather than the paddle of your kitchen aid) because it seems (in my estimation) to do a really nice job of getting the butter / sugar / egg portion really light and fluffy.  Then, you don't overmix when adding the dry ingredients.  That's the secret to a tender cake.  Try this one!

My husband loves these bars and this recipe now replaces all my others!  I use Duncan Hines whipped cream cheese frosting and then sprinkle a few walnuts on top.  The last time I used pecans which was good too.  Enjoy!

GREAT! Halved recipe and baked in 13x9.  Added cinnamon.  Instead of cream cheese frosting I used an old fashioned brown butter frosting.  A room full of teenage boys finished the entire cake in 5 minutes and looked for more.

My 35 years of looking for a good banana bar recipe is over!  These were absolutely fabulous.  Very moist and flavorful.  The only change I made was to substitute yogurt for the sour cream.  Used my own recipe for creme cheese frosting.  They were a hit for a church function!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of the few recipes from this site that I have been disappointed in.  I made no changed in the recipe other than to use homemade frosting.  I certainly didn't find them bad, just disappointing -- rather bland, cake-like texture.  I guess I expected more of a bar-cookie texture, and rather than have these, I would much rather make banana bread or banana cake from some favorite recipes.  Again, not bad, but no one that tried them when I made them found them overly tasty.  But thanks for sharing; I know lots of people really like them.  I'm sure it's just a matter of personal taste.

These were just average to me.  I made my own cream cheese frosting.  They were more like banana bread - I think I was expecting more of a cookie type thing.

Wow!  Made these this week and they were great.  The cake was moist and flavorful.  I made my own cream cheese frosting and added about a tbsp of creme de banana.  Terrific!  Thanks, Delta.

These were okay...really just banana bread with sickly sweet canned frosting on them, if I made them again, I would use my own banana bread recipe and cream cheese frosting from scratch...and add walnuts, otherwise not worth making.

I love it!  Instead of making another loaf of banana bread, I can use the old bananas to make bars.  Here are my low-fat modifications.  1/4 C. butter and 1/4 C. apple sauce (instead of 1/2 C. butter), splenda instead of sugar, egg substitute instead of the eggs and fat-free sour cream.  Instead of the frosting, I melted some choc. chips and drizzled over the bars - looked very pretty.  I'll be making these again!

This was so yummy! Instead of a jelly roll pan I used a 13x9 baking dish and just baked it a little longer. I frosted with cream cheese frosting II from this site. I took it to work and it was gone within the hour.

This was very good.  I made one batch according to the recipe and the other batch I added chocolate chips to it and used vanilla frosting as opposed to cream cheese.  I liked it better (I am a chocolate lover)!  I also think the vanilla frosting tasted better than the cream cheese (unless you're using homemade!)  Great recipe for parties.

I had a craving for something with bananas that would cure my sweet tooth. I made these tonight and they turned out great! Just what I needed to clear the fog from my brain, heehee! I do think that next time I made them, I'll add some cinnamon into the mixture. They seemed to be lacking in a little something or other and I think that would do the trick for me. Very good!

Excellent!!!  I also followed others advice and used the recipe for WHIPPED CREAM CREAM CHEESE FROSTING (Submitted by Tom) found on this site!!  We will definitely make these again.  I put the leftovers in the fridge because of the ingredients in the frosting.

This recipe is excellent!  I subtituted 1 container of peach yogurt because I didn't have any sour cream.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped nuts & 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  I frosted with a container of chocolate frosting I had in the pantry.  I will definetely make again!

My kids (who will NOT eat a banana)thought this was great!  I would try it with chopped nuts in it next time.  Very easy to make.  I did have to extend the baking time by about 10 minutes, but I was using an insulated jelly roll pan.

This is the best banana recipe ever!  My husband can't stop eating it.  I added nuts and made cream cheese frosting because this is too good for store bought frosting. I didn't have a jellyroll pan so used a 9x13 and it came out great.

Excellent!  I didn't have a jellyroll pan, so used 9X13", baked the bars at 400 degrees for approximately 30 minutes.  More like banana cake, but my family loved it.  I've used both the home-made cream cheese frosting, and the canned frosting, but the homemade is much, much better.

Excellent...excellent...excellent!!  I made this recipe for the people I work with.  I substituted 1/2 of the sugar in the cake with splenda and, like others....I made my own cream cheese icing so I could substitute some splenda in there too....no one who ate these suspected the substituted sugar.  Received many raves and requests for the recipe.  I'm sure I will be making this many times since it is a great way to use over-ripe bananas.

These were really really good, but mine came out more cake-like than bar-like. I made my own cream cheese frosting (8oz cream cheese, 1/4c butter, 2T honey, 1t vanilla and 2+c powdered sugar) and it came out tasting great. The flavor of the banana was just the way I like it.

This recipe should really be called "Frosted Banana Cake Squares" as they are really not anything like traditional bars.
However, they were really moist and yummy! I used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting on the allrecipes site as others suggested - soooo good!  Next time I think I may try other suggestions of using chocolate shavings or walnuts on top.  Or even use the banana flavoring if the bananas are not quite as ripe.  - Thanks for the suggestions!

I haven't tried this recipe yet (although it sounds yummy) since i'm not sure how to prepare it properly.
I was just wondering, once it's cooked do you frost it and then roll it up like a jelly roll or do you frost it and cut it into bars?  Does either way work?  Help please!
- Michelle

I must join in on the praises of these banana bars.  I made 2 batches having my husband bring a pan to work with him.  They were so good he thought about just leaving them here.  I promised I would make another batch so they went to work with him.  This recipe is very rich so instead of using a frosting I used Better Homes and Garden cream cheese icing recipe which I think was perfect.  Thank you for taking the time to submit this awesome recipe!

Delicious. I made this for my family and they absolutely adored it.  Their only suggestion was to add some walnuts so I added about 1 1/2 cups of them, it came out great.  I have already made this twice and will definitely be making it again.

These are very moist and good.  My children loved them.  I made my own frosting so it was not as sweet as the canned variety.  I also use 3 1/2 medium sized bananas.

These were excellent and very easy to make, which is a plus.  I added about a tsp. or so of cinnamon, which was a nice addition, and made my own cream cheese icing as well.  I also made Paul's Pumpkin Bars (off this site also) tonight too, and my husband said these were 100% better.

Made exactly per directions except for a little less sugar as some reviewers suggested.  If I made again, I will use all.  Thought that the sour cream made it taste sour.   I also would make it in a 9 x 13 pan next time as texture is more cake like than a bar. Raised nicely. Made many own cream cheese frosting.

I probably would  reduce the amount of  sugar.   Only because the bananas are sweet enough.   They were delicious.

Really a great use for over ripe bananas.  Didn’t have sour cream but used yogurt and added cinnamon.  We really enjoyed cake.  Will make again.

I found this, and just happened to have 3 over ripe bananas in the fridge- was going to make banana bread- but decided to try this.  I subbed in 1/2 cup of Truvia, along with the 1 cup of sugar, to cut back on the amount of sugar, and was out of sour cream, so used 1 cup of plain greek yogurt instead.  It turned out great!  My picky hubby really likes it, and I gave some of it to some friends and they also really enjoyed it.  Will definitely make again!

I have made this 3 times so far. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg and baked as muffins at 350 for 18-20 min. Fist time I used frosting and it was just too sweet for me. I do like them plain with my coffee.

This  was very good tho I made it somewhat differently. I used all the ingredients as listed but made my own cream cheese frosting. I only had a 7X7 inch pan so it came out higher, more like a cake rather than bars. I had to bake it for over 30 min to get it done.  The flavor could have been a bit more banana-y but it is very good and I will make it again.

Quick and easy. As per others, added slcinnamon and made in a 9x13 pan. Used 3 very ripe bananas. Made a chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site (added chocolate chips to the frosting for fun). Next time will try either a brown sugar frosting or a banana frosting as another reviewer recommended.

Delicious!  Everyone loved this recipe!  I baked the cake in a 12x12 pan and so had to increase the baking time a few minutes.  I also made my own cream cheese frosting.  The cake is moist and yummy!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, deltaj!

I reduced the sugar by half (3/4 cup), but otherwise stuck to the recipe except to bake in a 13x9. Very nice, lots of banana flavor, texture is thick and fluffy, very delightful! I can't imagine using more sugar, as this was plenty sweet for me. Will definitely make again and recommend the recipe to others.

I didn't have a jelly roll pan, so I put it in a square pan. Big problem! Didn't cook in the middle. I wish this recipe could be adapted to a more traditional pan.

Also, I added chopped walnuts to the recipe. Seemed like a no-brainer.

The bars didn't get done in the middle of the pan, even though I baked about 10 minutes longer. I used store bought frosting and will never do that again - way too sweet, I thought it was awful.

I just made this and it is delicious. I didn't put the frosting on yet and my husband snuck a piece and I had a taste.  It doesn't even need the frosting.  I'll put some on though so I can have the whole taste sensation.  This is an A++++ recipe.

This is the absolute best tasting cake! I use cake flour instead of the all purpose and every time it comes out moist and delish. It makes a truly fabulous sheet cake.

I am 14 and I love baking. I was really in the mood for something banana and this hit the spot. I did not have any alterations and I used an Easy Cream Cheese Frosting recipe that I found on Allrecipes. It made a lot and my family all loved it. Its like banana bread as a dessert. Definitely will make again

Followed the recipe exact, except used only 1C of sugar and the cream cheese frosting II recipe from allrecipes.  Excellent.  The kids love this!

Great recipe. I followed Megnerd's review: cut the sugar to one cup, used a 9x14 pan - baked for 30 and used her Chocolate Peanut Butter frosting. Next time I will use either a jar of banana baby food or banana yogurt to get more flavor.

Moist and delicious. I was going to make banana bars, but don't own a jelly roll pan so I looked at some reviews and used a 9x13 pan and cake turned out good. Took maybe 35-38 mins at 350. Covered pan with foil las few mins so it would bake and not burn. Iced with all recipes cream cheese frosting recipe cut in half. Will pass along to others

I make these banana bars with the exact ingredients listed, the only difference is I bake them in a 9x13 dish so the baking time is extended. They come out moist and delicious every time and disappear if I bring them somewhere to share! I've had multiple people ask for the recipe. The only change I wish they would make would be to add a homemade cream cheese frosting recipe. I prefer to make homemade so I have to search for that in a different recipe.

This is delicious! I had 2 browning bananas to use up so I thought I'd try this recipe.  I've tried some of the other banana cakes/bars on this site, but they weren't as flavorful as these.  I halved the recipe for an 8 x 8 pan.  Lowered the sugar to 2/3 cup instead of 3/4, but I think 1/2 cup would have also been fine.  Other than the sugar, no other changes.  I made a cream cheese frosting on this site.  This was a great combo.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I think this is the best banana cake type recipe on this site.  I've tried others, but they lacked a lot of banana flavor.

I made it as recommended and adding caramel extract. 
Iced it with homemade salted caramel icing and coated with peanuts. Absolutely delicious! Stores really well too and tasted even better the second day!

This was very good and moist. Reduced the sugar 1/2 cup. Used yogurt instead of sour cream. Also used a chocolate peanut butter icing as suggested by another reviewer. Was one of the better cakes I have ever eaten.

This was quick and easy to make. It was also very inexpensive.  Everyone loved them.   They were moist and easy to cut.   You can cut them into smaller pieces because they are sweet so you can get a lot of bars from one pan!

Delicious and moist. I really liked it and I used the exact recipe. I only used 2 small ripe bananas... probably could have used more for more banana taste.

These are super good!  They don't even need the icing but are super good with the icing.  I make individually wrapped desserts for meals on wheels customers and I was surprised that without the icing they hold up well with bagging and transporting.  On a scale of 1-10 my two pickiest eaters (kids) gave them a 10 and an 8 (without the icing!) Easy to make too.

This is a great recipe, but I did change a few things: I used half a cup of sour cream and half a cup of greek yogurt, added about 1/4th teaspoon of cinnamon when I added in the eggs, and used about 1 1/2 cups of mashed banana. It turned out very moist and just as delicious without the frosting!

These are wonderful! Lots of flavor and very moist.  I used an extra banana, half white sugar/ half brown sugar, and added cinnamon. I didnt have any cream cheese for frosting so i used a brown butter frosting, recipes also located here. 
Very happy with the results, ill be making these again.

These were very good. I made them exactly as laid out in the recipe. I'd change a few things though for next time; 1. A little less sugar 2. Like someone else suggested don't buy the frosting, make your own. Other than that, very good!

I have made this twice.  After the first bake, I cut the sugar back to 1 cup as I found it to be way too sweet!  The bananas have plenty of natural sugars, and leaving out 1/2 cup of white sugar doesn't deter from the taste, nor the texture of the cake.   I preferred frosting with a light vanilla buttercream, or a brown butter frosting.  Also, I too baked in a 9 x 13 pan at 350oF for 35 mins. Perfection!

The bar part if this recipe is moist and tasty. My only change was to make cream cheese frosting rather than to buy a can. Great way to use ripe bananas!

My 4-star rating was only because of the suggestion of using canned frosting.

Thank you for a very delicious recipe!  We modified it slightly.  We used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and replaced one cup of all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  We used three large ripe bananas for the banana mash.  Instead of baking it in a jelly roll pan, we used a 9 x 13 glass pan.  It took about 25 minutes to bake.  This was delicious on it's own, but everything is always better with frosting.  The next time we bake this, we will try the jelly roll pan.  Thank you again for a delicious recipe.

This was pretty good, although I did change a few things..... 
First, I took half a cup of sugar away, next I added about 1/2-1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips, and them I sprinkled about a tablespoon (or two) after I spread the batter on the pan, and that was all the tweaking I did!

Good recipe. I used buttermilk instead of sour cream and the hubby couldn't stop eating them.  In fact I made them 3 times in one week simply because I had the over ripe bananas.  I made the cream cheese frosting posted in another review and it was perfect.  I froze some and gifted some and of course we ate some.  YUMMMMMM!

Made this in 13x9 pan.  Cooked for 30-35 minutes because used 3.5 very ripe bananas which I think was more than 1 cup.  Used whipped cream cheese frosting recipe on website on top.

Moist banana cake that keeps for days.  I used icing that consisted of 1/2 banana, 2 cups powdered sugar, a little vanilla and a splash of milk.

So delicious and moist! I used 3 large bananas in mine and no vanilla, it turned out fabulous. I also use my own homemade cream cheese frosting.

Made these yesterday an frosted with the flour type frosting and topped with chopped toasted walnuts. I took them and left in the lunch room at the surgical unit where I volunteer. What a big hit they were!! Even the doctors made sure to tell me how good they are. Made them EXACTLY (should always do the first time) as the recipe called for and no changes are needed. The only thing I did was use a 9X13 pan as that is all I had, and baked accordingly. Very moist and flavorful. This recipe is a keeper.

I made these for a party I was having and they were a hit.    I thought they would be popular with the kids but I think the adult ate them all before the kids even had a taste.

Great recipe!  Easy and turns out moist and cakey.  Had to use a 9x13 inch pan so I baked it for 30 minutes.  I used the 2 medium sized very ripe bananas I had.  I wasn't sure what frosting I wanted but decided to use a vanilla glaze from this site and it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this every time I have some extra bananas starting to over ripen.

I love cakes, and sweet desert type breads. I made this recipe but  I found out I only had enough ripe banana's for 1 cup. So I improvised the original recipe. I added 3/4 cup organic caned pumpkin to make up the difference I also added a small amount of allspice, and a dash more of nutmeg. I baked for the 27mins as stated in the recipe, but ended up checking it 4 times after adding more baking time. turned out super delicious, and moist.

Very good.  Made according to recipe.  However, a 16 oz container of frosting isn't enough.  Even with spreading the frosting thin, I couldn't frost the entire pan.  One container only covered 85%.  I'd recommend buying two containers or making your own.

Very tasty.  Used 1 cup mashed banana as the recipe called for (2 bananas), but a third probably wouldn't have hurt.  Made the vanilla cream cheese frosting from the McCormick red velvet cupcake recipe.

These bars were SO moist! Followed the advice from other reviews, and cut the sugar in half as the bananas were plenty sweet. Paired with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site, and it was wonderful. I find they are best served chilled.

These are delicious and soooo easy to make. Very moist.  I bake on a large cookie sheet for a thinner bar, and do a browned butter frosting over mine, since I have some who don't like the cream cheese flavor. Kids gobble them up every time!

07.03.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25059/frosted-banana-bars/ ... I reduced sugar to 1c & made pour-on-while-warm chocolate icing.  As far as the cake - okay, bars - go, it didn't wow me, but it was good & definitely easy to make.Love the idea of a jelly roll pan - more pieces, less cook time.  'Gotta remember that little tip!  :D   Note4Me:  MEGNERD review has chocolate peanut butter frosting recipe.  Girl with cake is her photo, most helpful.  I like my favorite banana cake better but the tip of using a jelly roll pan & less bake time is great.

OK I changed the recipe...  I  am sorry but I did.  changed sugar to 1 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown.  Had a little more mashed banana about 1/4 cup more and I added a brimming cup of chopped dates all else the same.It took longer to bake just kept testing.  Try it, you will like it.

Really terrific bars, made recipe as written but without frosting, weighed ingredients for accuracy, used a 10x15 jellyroll pan, no bad comments from a class of 7th graders or their teachers, kids who said they didn't like banana bread were converted. Did not feel the frosting was necessary and I am not sure we would have liked them frosted.  They are plenty dense and rich on their own, why gild the lily?  But if you do like a very very sweet heavy bar, agree with others that homemade cream cheese frosting is a must -- grocery store icing always has an aftertaste and it's not hard to make the icing from scratch. Plenty of good icing recipes on this site.

I had two small, over ripe bananas to use up, so I halved the recipe and baked them in a 8" x 10-1/2" pan (I know, that's a weird size pan, but it has a cover, and it worked great). Baked for 28 minutes. I topped these with Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting (also from this site), and a few chopped walnuts. Very tasty, and the kids loved it with a side of fresh strawberries for dessert! Thanks for the recipe!

I just made these and used apple sauce (no butter) Splenda (no sugar) Fat free sour cream and no frosting used free cool whip now they are diet friendly and okay for diabetics and they are good. Do not rise as much next time I will use smaller pan.

These are fantastic! I have found my favorite dessert of all time. I can not believe how good these are. What a wonderful recipe to use up some bananas. I made a homemade cream cheese frosting instead of that old can stuff. The other thing I changed was I used half whole wheat flour and have white flour. Nothing else was changed. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This cake was amazing!! It is probably the most moist cake I have ever tried. I read all the reviews and decided to cut the sugar in half and the cake is still perfect. I also made my own icing using 1/4 cup of butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 4oz cream cheese and 2 cups icing sugar. I baked the cake, let it cool, put it in the fridge (advice from another review) to firm up and then I put the icing on. Everyone at work is getting a new treat tomorrow :)

I had to edit this after taking this in to work....it is worthy of more than five stars!

The grandsons love these, very tender and moist. I usually use scratch cream cheese icing though. It makes a large batch and freezes well.

Thought it was a great way to use up bananas that's been sitting in my freezer.  Didn't feel like making banana bread.   I made the cream cheese frosting from AR's "banana cake VI".

"Wow's" from the whole bunch of my boys, including Dad.  I only added a little pineapple because I was short on ripe bananas and used 1 C of Sugar and used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c coconut oil.  LOVE the pineapple addition...The hubs requested for his birthday, in Dec, immediately.  THANK YOU!!!

These are great! I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, and baked in a 9x13 pan. I had to bake it a bit longer - maybe 35 minutes. The middle fell a bit, but it didn't matter. They are very moist and dense, but still cake-like. Sort of like a banana brownie, if that makes any sense. I frosted half and froze half; tried both Cream Cheese Frosting II and the banana frosting a few other reviewers mentioned. The banana frosting wins, hands-down, and is lower in fat, besides! Thanks for the recipe, will make again!

Once people try these, they come back for seconds, thirds...  I make them in the 10 x 15 pan (aka jellyroll) pan so they are about an inch or so thick.  The sour cream adds a lot, and when I've compared this recipe to others, it seems to be unique.  Make sure you add it or add plain yogurt (I've done both).  I do tend to cut back on the sugar - maybe a scant cup of white and a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

These are wonderful!!  I used 1 c. white flour and 3/4ish cup of whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 c. flax meal. 1 real egg and 1 equivalent with ener-g egg substitute,  1 c.non fat greek yogurt, 3 overripe bananas, and 1 c. sucanat to replace the white sugar. They were super moist and heavy in flavor!!  I made the cream cheese frosting II as suggested. Heaven in my mouth!!

These were super Yummy not to mention simple to make. The only thing I changed was to make home made cream cheese frosting instead of the canned stuff with the trans fat. It may be weird, but my favorite recipe for cc frosting is the Clone of a Cinnabon one here on Allrecipes. Oh man, it's good!

Although not bad, I've made (and sampled) many banana bars that are far better than these were. Since I had several perfectly ripened, snack-size bananas that needed to be used up quickly, I decided to give this a whirl. If for nothing other than finding a use for bananas that would have otherwise gone to waste, I'm glad to have stumbled upon this easy recipe. NOTE: One reviewer suggested refrigerating these to make cutting easier. Doing so actually made my bars taste worse! Even at room temperature, my bars tasted "off." I attribute this to placing them in the fridge in the first place (it altered their texture). :( Mishap aside, these just aren't for me. Maybe these will float your boat, but they didn't mine. Thanks anyways, deltaj. :-)

These had a great flavor and I liked them a lot, but I'm not sure what I did wrong, because these came out moist, but crumbly like a box cake mix instead of dense and chewy like I would expect a "bar" to be. They fell apart easily when trying to cut them and get them out of the pan. I frosted them with a cream cheese icing and they tasted great. Just need to tweak the recipe somehow to get them to come out more dense for me.

FANTASTIC!  I made this recipe instead of the one I've used for decades because I had some sour cream I wanted to use up.  This is now my "go to" banana cake recipe.  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  Like all "keeper cakes" it was better the second day and I imagine it would be an excellent freezer cake.   I offer no improvements, we thought it was perfect as is.

My husband LOVES this recipe but I make it  more like a cake than bars: he prefers the cake type over the bars, and I add a total of 3 bananas b/c he loves bananas so much. He asks me to make it just about every week. It's easy and quick so I can make it quickly for him.

I had some very ripe bananas to use and this easy simple and tasty recipe fit the bill.  I didn't have any sour cream so I doubled the banana amount and it tasted so moist and delicious.  I didn't even frost them.  Thanks deltaj for sharing...!!

Great, easy way to use up over-ripe bananas.  I made the bar part as written, but used a homemade cream cheese frosting recipe.  I am taking these to work tomorrow, and I am sure they will be a big hit!

Great flavor. Made muffins and ended up with lots of melted butter below the paper cups. I will need to adjust the butter or perhaps add more flour next time.

I really really like these. Made as stated except added some cinnamon, and made my own cream cheese frosting. I like this recipe because I make banana bread all the time, and this is a nice change. Will probably make these more than I should. lol

These are great!  Just make sure your bananas are very ripe for optimum banana flavor.  The school teachers I work with loved them--so did my kids!  Yumm-o!

This bar/cake was devine!  I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, used a little over 1 c of bananas and made my own Cream Cheese Icing (from AR).  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make again

Oh boy this is good!  So nice and moist and bursting with banana flavor, that gets better as time goes on.  I used a chocolate/peanut butter frosting as suggested by another reviewer and that put it over the top for me.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these today, and they came out quite tasty.  To make them lower-fat, I substituted:  egg substitute for the eggs, vanilla low-fat yogurt for the sour cream, and I used 1/4 C butter and 4 oz of applesauce.  To counter all the low-fat ingredients, I added peanut butter chips.  No frosting needed!

Sooooo yummy!!!!  I made this today with a few adjustments.  To the recipe I added 2oz vegetable oil, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I made a homemade cream cheese frosting, well worth it and of course it always taste better than the store bought frosting.

These are very tasty bars, they had a nice banana flavor I used 2 medium sized bananas didn’t measure I thought the bars were a little rubbery! I didn’t frost them I just sprinkled powdered sugar…It’s a nice way to use up over ripened bananas…Thanks!

My family loved these!  I made them with a coconut cream cheese frosting and it was a perfect compliment!  I think they'd also be great if you added in crushed or diced pineapple which I will try next time.

Not sure how the cooked bars are going to taste, but the batter is scrumptious.  I think I added more banana than called for, because I eyed it, but what's not to like about more banana flavor??  Simple, easy recipe.

Excellent way to use those old nanners. Moist and tasty. I agree with some of the other reviewers - skip the canned frosting. I used cream cheese frosting. I will use this recipe a lot, because we never eat all of the bananas that we buy! I also used a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 30 minutes.

Very yummy!I doubled the recipe due to having a ton of banana's that needed to be used asap! I did use half whole wheat pastry flour & white flour.Used half the sour cream and added  more banana's.Very moist & flavorful.I did not like the frosting on these made them to sweet for me & my kid's agree. To be honest i think they would be great with just a dusting of Confection's sugar & no frosting.I will be making these again.Next time i will try replaceing the butter with apple sauce & All the sour cream with banana's and use all whole wheat pastry flour to make them a healthier treat!Maybe i will even replacing the sugar with honey...Thank you :))

this sounds pretty good i haven't made it yet i like bananas and i like bars too but the picture seems like there's too much frosting and why is there a leaf on it i don't like to eat leaves and bananas that just doesn't go together so i might just leave out the leaf and make less frosting but i'm excited because i like banana bars and this is a new recipe

I love this recipe! It doesn't even need frosting, but I specifically made this recipe because I had leftover Cream Cheese Frosting II to use on something and had printed this to try out sometime. The cake is perfectly moist and just the right amount of sweet and banana flavored. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan and the pieces are thin, but perfect for a snack or light dessert. I used reduced fat sour cream and splenda instead of sugar and the flavor is fantastic! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Made these bars as a last minute dessert for visitors.  Everyone loved them!  Made my own cream cheese frosting using recipe from the AR site, definitely made these that much better as I don't think store bought cream cheese frosting is near as good.  Baked up nicely using a jelly roll pan.  Really yummy served just after cooled and frosted but I also agree with others who have said that after being refrigerated the banana flavor is enhanced!  Will definitely make these again!  Thanks for a great recipe, always looking to use those overripe bananas!

Excellent recipe. Great banana flavor. Made in a 15x10" pan and they were a nice thickness. Served cold as suggested by another reviewer and it really did bring out the banana flavor. I frosted with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting recipe from this site. An excellent combination with rave reviews! Will make again.

these are awesome! made them in a 9x13, 30 minutes was perfect. added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, used 1/2 C brown sugar instead of white, if you're unsure, use extra banana! i used 3 medium sized ones and it was perfect. frosted with vanilla frosting and dusted with cinnamon sugar. turned out super delicious. can't wait to make them again :) thank you!

These are delicious.  Now that I have made them several times, I find that a cup of sugar is plenty. Usually, I don't frost them, but the Coconut-Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site makes these look really special.

Delicious! I am a big banana bread fan, so I loved this and it made a great dessert. Tastes like banana bread but denser and sweeter. I'm not a big cream cheese fan so I put regular vanilla frosting and I liked it alot. Will be making this again!

Cut the recipe in half and baked it in my 9in spring form pan for 25 min.  Turned out moist and delicious!  Used the cream cheese frosting II that other reviewers recommended and topped with chopped walnuts...made for a very RICH dessert!

YUM!!  I didn't have sour cream so I used Vanilla Greek yogurt and then omitted the vanilla.  Made my own cream cheese frosting:  1/2 c. butter, 1 8oz pkg cream cheese, 2 c. powdered sugar.  Everyone (both kids and grownups, even my husband) loved them.

My children love banana bread and I made this as a change one day.  It is soo light and yummy.  I cut back on the sugar and added some cinnamon.  I also omitted the icing, it really doesn't need it.  The kids and fam raved about this, I will be making it again.

This didn't turn out how I had originally expected. The bars without the frosting were perfectly moist after 25 mintues and had the perfect amount of flavor.   I bought premade frosting to use. I taste-tested right after baking and was hesitant to use the frosting. I put frosting on a few squares, but it wasn't nearly as good and just eating them plain. I'm not sure if it would've been better with home-made cream cheese frosting or not. They were great all by themselves.

It was very moist, but more like a sheet cake than a "bar". I didn't really taste the banana, even thought I used very ripe ones. Overall, it was ok.

I found this recipe similar to this on another site a few years ago and it has become one of my best sellers. I don't use canned frosting thought..i make a cream cheese frosting. I get an order for these bars once a week.

Very good.  Big hit on "painting day" as a sweet snack.  Only problem was I did have a spot that didn't bake all the way through, even after baking longer than recipe called for and testing with a toothpick.

These are delicious!  I had to substitute vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, but they were still fantastic.  Because of that substitution and the advice of another reviewer, I cut the sugar to one cup.  I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, and I will be making this a lot in the future!

4 1/2 stars actually. I used a 13x9 pan and baked 35 minutes.  I DID find this recipe to be 'bar' like, not 'cake' like as some others have stated.  Perhaps the smaller pan helped.  Used 2 extra large bananas and 1 1/4 cups sour cream.  Topped w/ 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' from this site.

These are tasty, but they're basically cake-like banana bread with cream cheese frosting.  The frosting does complement the banana bread flavor nicely, but I wish the poster had included a frosting recipe instead of just telling us to use store-bought frosting.  I think the name "bars" is a little misleading since it implies that these are more like cookies when they're basically cake.  The flavor is best when the "bars" have completely cooled, so don't be in a rush to eat them.

This is a great banana cake recipe.  I used a 9x12 pyrex pan greased and it came out great. The cake itself probably needs no frosting although I did frost mine.  If you are a fan of banana breads this is a good one for you to try.

These are awesome! I made these one evening and was tired,so I didn't feel like making cream cheese frosting. I used a can of vanilla frosting that I had on hand. They would most definitely be better with cream cheese frosting. Will make these again for sure.

Great way to get rid of all those bananas.  Picky kids loved it too.  Definitely go with the homemade cream cheese frosting.  Awesome recipe.  Thanks.

My kids ADORE this recipe! Seriously - my 11-year old actually pants when I pull it out of the fridge. I will say that using homemade cream cheese icing is part of it - such an easy thing to do, but such a difference in taste (and I did scale back to just under 1 c. of sugar in the bars), but this is an unusual (we're so used to banana BREAD,) quick, no fail, feeds-a-ton-of-people recipe and one that validates my investment in a jellyroll pan after all these years! (FYI for me, personally  as of 8/5- don't try with 4 bananas 3 works best. Four made it too dense, less cake-like. I make this at least once a month - love it!)

Very good. I put mine in a 13x9 cake pan and increased the baking time.  My family would much rather have this than banana bread with or with out the frosting.

fantastic!!  the only thing i changed was the frosting - i made my own cream cheese frosting.  but the recipe is absolutely delicious and addicting.  the only thing i will change next time is decreasing the sugar to 3/4c. or 1 c.  it didnt seem like too much sugar, but i know it's not all necessary, esp. with the frosting. thanks so much for the recipe!

These were really good and super easy to make.  They were a little more "cake-like" than I expected, even though I used the 10x15 jelly roll pan.  I guess I was expecting something a little more dense.  They were good though, light and fluffy.  I used three ripe bananas and I thought it was the perfect amount of banana flavor.  I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe (1 stick of butter, 3 oz cream cheese, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 2 cups powdered sugar), and thought it was the perfect complement to these yummy bars.  Like one of the other reviewers stated, it's a great way to use up your over-ripe bananas without making your standard banana bread.  I will make these again, for sure!  Thanks for the recipe.  **Update**  After putting these in the refrigerator, they were more of what I was after...a little more dense and even more flavorful.  Yummy with a cold glass of milk.

We are doing weight watchers, so I totally changed this to be much lower in fat and calories and it still turned out great! Instead of 1/2 cup of butter, I used 1/4 margarine plus 1/3 cup applesauce; substituted splenda for 1/2 the sugar; added an additional 1/4 cup of flour; and used 3 ripe bananas.  No frosting for us, but these were still moist, delicious, and plenty indulgent!  I made them into mini-muffins (baked 350F for 15 mins), and you get 2 for 1 point!  YUM!

i made the whole recipe correct and baked it 10 minutes extra in the oven because they weren't baked enough. i took them out thinking they'd be done enough but i just cut one and it was not. i don't know how the rest of you got yours to turn out.

Why bother with banana bread?!  These are an awesome way to get rid of those over-ripe bananas.  And they go a lot quicker than the "bread" version.  I was lazy and used Pillsbury's Cream Cheese Frosting.  Yummy!

These bars are wonderful! I found them to be plenty sweet without frosting which is good because 1/2 the pan was gone before they even cooled.  We will be making these again!

Wonderful. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II submitted by Janni. Very delicious. Didn't change either recipe. My 21 yr old son said it was one of the best cakes I've ever made and that says alot because I bake ALOT.

This recipe was totally awesome! Like many other reviewers said, this recipe is definitely more of a cake than a bar. I did modify the recipe though - Instead of white sugar, I used cane sugar; instead of the sour cream, I used vanilla yogurt. I also didn't frost mine as hubby said they'd be fine without - These were great! The rich banana aroma filled the house, and the flavor was incredible. I stored them in the fridge after cutting in bars and put them in our lunches as snacks - they were moist and didn't crumble. Even my 4yr old that won't eat anything without frosting - ate these up!

These are the best ever!  I'm not a sweets person, but these are fantastic.  The big problem is all of the sugar that makes them taste so good. So I won't make them again for my husband's lunch, but I will make them for a potluck.  These bars are so incredibly delicious there are no words to describe how wonderful they are.

Pretty good recipe. Like others, I used a 9x13 pan which extended my cook time to 45 minutes. With the addition of an extra banana I found the finished product to have plenty of flavor. For serving I cut the cake in half and stacked the sides together with a layer of Nutella (a Hazelnut chocolate spread) icing in between and then iced the whole cake as well. We took this to a luncheon and it was gone in seconds. For the icing I used the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe on this website substituting Nutella instead of Peanut Butter.

i uses a roasting pan, it was the only pan i had that was big enough to make the banana batter thin like a bar.  worked fine!  i cut the sugar to one cup and used four bananas.  i made a frosting out of low fat cream cheese, powdered sugar, soy milk to thin it and coconut flakes for fun.  turned out wonderful!

These are very good! I used 3 large bananas because I love bananas! I think it probably just made it more moist. I dont own a jellyroll pan so I just used 2 small cookie sheets. It made them thinner and more "bar" like. I used a cream cheese frosting recipe from this site. They are very rich!! One thing that I like about this recipe is that I usually have all the ingredients and it is Also very cost efficient. Next time I will definately add Walnuts to the frosting or add to the mix. Thank you for sharing!!

Simple to make and quite tasty.  I also was looking for something a little more "dense" and "bar" like, but I won't complain, because these were awesome!  I frosted mine with a store bought cream cheese frosting that I mixed with cool whip.  Nice and light, just like the bars :-)

Great banana bars!  They are cake-like and delicious.  I also used the Cream Cheese II frosting recipe.  I can't say enough good things about these bars.  You can't go wrong making them.

I am giving them 5 stars cause they are really good, but I was expecting more of a cookie type bar, mine were like cake and had to eat them with a fork. But flavor was wonderful and they make alot, and quite and easy dessert to make last minute.

Fantastic!!! I used two large-ish bananas (I feel like I could've used three and it would've improved the recipe, but two didn't hurt it at all) and didn't frost the bars. Instead I added 1c of chocolate chips and 1/4tsp of cinnamon--they were DELICIOUS. I lined my plain old rimmed cookie sheet with buttered aluminum foil and it did the trick just fine--with less cleanup :) Next time I'll cut out 1/2c of sugar b/c I don't think it'll be necessary. Thanks for the recipe!

I had just over 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of a full cup so I think that's why I had to bake these for almost twice the length suggested.  I also didn't have any frosting, but they were still very tasty and a nice alternative to making banana bread with over ripe bananas.

Great use for your brown bananas, I used three banana, added chopped walnuts and a hand full of raisin to the batter. Used the cream cheese frosting as suggested, but cut the frosting recipe in half.Sprinkled crushed walnuts on top.

Wonderful banana bars!  I used a 9x13 pan and it was like a banana cake!  I also used the cream cheese frosting II on this site. It was incredible!

Great recipe, super taste.  Iused homemade frosting and it was great.  The only thing I would change is to cook it in a 9x13 pan.  It was a little flimsy, and I think making it a little thicker would be a good thing.  I have a child who can sniff out a fruit or vegetable in anything and won't touch it.  But he loved these.

This was a very moist and delicious cake.  I frosted it with homemade cream cheese frosting.  My son took it to work and it all went--they said the best ever!  I am placing this in my keepers box because I always have extra bananas!

This was absolutely amazing!  I made homemade cream cheese frosting and let me put it this way, I made a large pan and a small pan and it was gone within two days.  My family couldn't stay away from it.  I can't wait to make it again!

Easy and delicious, even without frosting. Co-workers & family loved them. The entire recipe gone in l day (and the uncooked dough is addictive).

At first I thought thesSe were great, not I think they are fantastic.  I happen to make the recipe without the baking powder.  It makes them delightfully dense.  Sometimes I make it with the levener, skip the frosting and enjoy it as a breakfast bread.

Very good!  I was intrigued when I saw this recipe and had to make it.  I used Chocolate Sour Cream frosting instead, so it's tastes much like a chocolate covered banana.  More cakey than cookie-bar-ish, but very moist and delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

2 stars don't mean I didn't enjoy...it just wasn't something outstanding.  Pretty much, banana bread with icing.  I should have picked up on that merely from the ingredients...I just had some pretty high hopes based on all the reviews.  I'm sure I'll make it again but it won't be something made regularly.  Thanks.  :)

Made these following directions exactly.  Everyone liked them.  It's more of a cake than a bar but yummy!!!  Used store bought cream cheese icing.  Will make again.  Thanks,

I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and used 3 extremely ripe bananas.  They were still really sweet.  I left off the cream cheese frosting because we just really didn't need it! They were still great and gobbled up.  I'm sure I will try them with the frosting sometime but you can make them without and they are wonderful moist and delicious.

Wow, these are very good! Before I baked them I read other reviewers' comments and was going to make homemade frosting but I ran out of time and used canned cream cheese icing instead. They were still wonderful-easy to make and a great snack for the kids because of the bananas.

I will be making these again soon. Next time I will add a teaspoon of cinnamon for just a little kick.

Thanks for posting this!

I LOVED these bars, so does my family, a great, simple recipe, so much better for the kids than packaged sweets as you can control the sugar you put in!

These were perfect!!!  I love them.  I made the recipe for the bars exactly like it called for and I made my own homemade cream cheese frosting.  YUMMY!!  I'm having them for breakfast as we speak.  I think these would be great for any occasion.

Delicious!  More like a snack cake square than a cookie.  The lemon frosting is what makes it so good.

This recipe didn't turn out like I expected; I was expecting a bar-like cookie, but this turned out to be a cake. I served it with homemade cream cheese icing - it turned out moist but overall I'd rather use my bananas for banana bread.

Very easy to make and came out light and fluffy with a lovely moist banana flavour. I only had one banana to use so I had to halve the recipe and fiddle with the cooking time but it still came out perfect. Topped it with the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site as others recommended and it disappeared very quickly. Great kid pleaser.

Terrific!!!  The flavor was wonderful and it kept for a few days without losing its flavor or becoming hard.  I used the whipped cream frosting that everyone else used.  I think I could have ate that stuff by the spoonful.   I added some chopped walnuts to this.  I believe that is the only thing I did different.  I will make this recipe again.

This recipe seemed to take about 8 min. longer than listed. It was still very soft and sticky in the middle after cooled and frosted. Next time I'll try using less banana. They turned out very very good. Great flavor, very easy to make. I will make this again as everyone loved it and was almost gone as soon as they were frosted!

My hubby usually hates deserts but when he tried this one, he ate 3 of them and then said I could make this everyday if I like. I used a simple cream cheese frosting (from ar.com) if anyone cares to use it:
Ingred....
1)6T Cream cheese (equals 4oz)
2)1/3 C butter,softened
3)1 1/3 C. Powdered sugar
4)1 T. Cream (whipping or heavy).
5)1 t. vanilla extract
Blend butter & cream cheese together then add rest of ingredients, it's very velvety. I had about 1/2 of a cup leftover after frosting the banana bars.

Yum! This was an excellent dessert. If you love bananas, you are going to love this dessert. I used a 9x13 inch pan so the bars were more cakelike. Once I added one can of cream cheese frosting, it was like a banana cake. I loved it! I will definitely be recommending this recipe.

These were okay, but I expected a lot more from a 'Top Ten' recipe.  I used Betty Crocker whipped cream cheese frosting, perhaps these would have been better with the recommended Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting.  I probably will not make again.

This recipe was delicious!....however it did not yield 36 bars as recipe stated, unless you made the bars so small that they were "bite size" morsels. Worth making..great taste!

These were excellent with Betty Crockers cream cheese frosting recipe. I only had half of the banana needed so I substituted half with applesauce. It was great, nice and moist. This was very similr to pumpkin roll, I am going to try a few modifications next time to see if I can get it to roll without cracking!

These are the best!  I add a total of three bananas so they are really moist.

Yes, make these banana bars when you have three ripe bananas sitting around.  I found these bars pleased parents of young children who don't allow them to eat anything with nuts.  You certainly don't miss them but next time I think some coarsely chopped walnuts on the icing would be a nice change of pace.  Thanks for the recipe, Delta.

These bars are excellent.  Everyone at work and at home loved them.  I would recommend using a homemade cream cheese frosting as I did not care for the supersweet store-bought frosting.  These are very good.

I am baking this right now and if it tastes even half as good as the batter we are in for a treat! This has the perfect amount of bannana and sweetness! We will be eating it tonight at a cook out and I am sure I will not have left-overs!!! Thanks for the fantastci recipe. I too added 3 bannanas...no measuring :) and I used the recipe for cream cheese frosting recomended by one of the other users (found on allrecipes)

My family LOVED this recipe.  It couldn't have been easier.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did not have the right size jelly roll pan.  I used a 9X13 cake pan instead, and let it bake for an extra 10 minutes.  Turned out wonderful!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It's going in my permanent collection!

Really good! I took them to church for our coffeebar and I left with half a dozen requests for the recipe! I added a little more bananas and made homeade frosting. Excellent and I will definitely make over and over.

Awesome snack cake and a great way to use up those inevitable brown bananas--I iced this cake with the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site to make a delicious summer dessert.  My husband and kids loved it!!

I love this recipe! My daughter loves bananas, but will only eat them while they are still hard. I've tried many recipes to use up over-ripe bananas, and this has to be my favorite. I always bring home an empty pan whenever I take these anywhere!

These were great!  I didn't have cream cheese frosting (store bought) so I had to make my own.  I brought these to a party at work and everyone loved them.  Great banana taste and they are very moist.  Best of all, they're easy to make!!
