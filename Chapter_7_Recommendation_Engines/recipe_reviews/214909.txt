Great recipe and a nice ending to a bbq meal! You don't have to feel guilty about this especially with the fat free vanilla frozen yogurt! The gingersnap cookies were a nice touch and gave it a really nice crunch. I wouldn't change a thing.

My family thought I was crazy when I plunked peaches on the grill midway through dinner.  But, their mouths were watering as they watched me pile on the brown sugar, vanilla bean ice cream, and cookie crumbs!  Even my non-peach-eater asked for a bowl.  This was the perfect end to a summer meal.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Really yummy! Peaches need to be ripe though..made that mistake. The key to this delicious recipe is the gingersnaps! Absolutely amazing!!

Easy. Used vanilla ice cream, but would be more refreshing if using frozen yogurt. Still would like to try with vanilla bean ice cream. Only change I'll make next time is using more ginersnaps.  I think that is what makes this dessert. Would recommend that if using ice cream, to use less brown sugar since ice cream is sweeter.

Yum... used my indoor grill, vanilla bean ice cream, and Big Soft Ginger Cookies from this site. Delicious combo - warm peaches, cold ice cream, and chunks of cookie!

We had family from out of town staying with us and we made these for dessert.  Did exactly what the recipe called for and they were delicous.  Our guest said that they were the best peaches they have ever had. I agree, they are very good.

This was good, but I think could have been better if the peaches were cooked longer at a medium heat instead of high. Ours were still somewhat crunchy after grilling. I don't have a torch, so just broiled them on low for about 3 minutes watching carefully as to not burn them. I topped with homemade frozen yogurt and crumbled gingersnaps. I think next time I might try a crumbled cookie that is less powerful tasting like vanilla wafers since I felt the gingersnaps took over the peach flavor.

This recipe was great! Loved it! 
We went camping and didn't have icecream or gingersnaps so we tried marshmellow and crushed graham crackers instead.  Also, amazing!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is amazing JUST the way it is written.  I've made this a few times.  When we couldn't find fresh peaches, we used the peach halves in cans (drained of syrup and rinsed).  Still good!!

This is a great summer dessert and a creative way to use the grill when it is still hot from cooking dinner.
