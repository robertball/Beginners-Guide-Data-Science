Don't even try recipe! I followed the recipe exactly how it's suppose to be made. Definitely not good in an air fryer! The second batch I fried in oil and it was delicious but in the air fryer the dough had no color and the shrimps were a little over cooked.

Ugh. I tried. I preheated my air fryer, lined it too. The batter ran off and and cooked up like a pancake leaving my food over cooked and baked.  I fried the remaining in oil. I thought the breading had no taste but we loved the dip.  I did have to salt the shrimp.  I also made up several veggies using the same batter.
