I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO POPULAR!!!

I served up these burgers at a big corporate picnic where there was a burger making contest.  I made this recipe exactly the way it was posted and I took first place out of 7 teams representing 20 cooks.  I made them into 1/2 patties, put the roasted Jalepenos on top and melted Tilamook Pepper Jack cheese over them.  All on an Infared Grill, of course.  Best dang burger I have ever had!

I have used this site for about 20 recipes and 5 different burgers. This is BY FAR the best burger on this site so far and probably also the best burger I have ever tasted. Follow the ingrediants exactly and use about half the seeds for a great burger. I want to eat these burgers for all my meals!!!

I left out the jalapeno peppers because my dad cannot tolerate spicy food, but next time I will put in 1 or 2 peppers because it seemed like the burgurs could handle some more kick.  But even without the peppers, my family devoured these burgurs!!  
UPDATE: I made these for a 4th of July bbq, so I left out the jalapenos (again) because not everyone likes spicy.  But to keep the kick in the burger, I doubled all of the spices (I tripled the garlic), added lots of fresh parsley and some ground turkey and EVERYONE went nuts.  They were probably the best burgurs that I have ever made.

AWESOME! I have cooked these burgers 4 times now and they get better everytime. Always grilled them, and made some alterations. For people who dont want the spicy, I've switched the jalepenos for chiles and that was all it needed. I've also added another egg to hold it all together, a full bag of chili cheese fritos instead of regular, and MOST IMPORTANT, a half cup of blue mon beer! They are so good, we will never cook regular burgers again!

these are great!  For those of you that didn't think it was spicy enough make sure you add the jalapeno seeds.  I added about half, and combined with the pepper jack cheese they were plenty spicy.

Followed this recipe exactly. I'm from central AZ, so I thought I knew hot. However. These burgers are HOT. My husband couldn't finish his. I am going to make these again, changing the jalapeneo amount to 1/3. Either I got ahold of some amazingly potent peppers, or we are total wimps. I know there's flavor in these burgers, we just had trouble finding it because we were too busy sucking down ice water.

I also followed this recipe as written. Except I toasted the buns.I really am shocked at the results. My kids LOVED these burgers. They are fast food burgeraholics. They usually only eat 1 burger each so I made the extras into patties and froze them while the kids ate. My son comes down stairs and says "Mommy that was the best burger ever!,I want more!" They made me promise to make them again the next night. So I did and now instead of going to Checker's, Hardees,or Wendy's my kids now prefer theses.Great job thanks so much ?

I used sunchips (garden Veggie) because that is what I had on hand.  My husband said that these were the best burgers he has even eaten!  Great recipe, thanks!

SO GOOD!!!!  The only changes I made were adding some liquid smoke (cooked   on foreman grill) and used double the amount of fritos, which were chili cheese flavor.  I froze half of the burgers and they tasted great the second time around too!  I will only make burgers this way from now on!!

These were okay.  The fritos were soggy in the cooked meat.  I ate a few bites.. wasn't for me but my family thought they were good.

These were excellent! We did everything the same, except used double the amount of egg as the recipe calls for to help keep them together. Husband LOVED them! Great flavor and a nice extra kick! We'll definitely keep this as a favorite. Thank you for the recipe!

With all the complex ingredients, I was really hoping for something special.  Unfortunately, this tasted like a plain meatloaf pretending to be a hamburger.

Absolutely the best burger we've ever had! It was juicy and flavorful. Roasting the Jalapenos took away their heat and only left their flavor. The salt from the Fritos was a delightful addition. Can't rave enough!

This wasn't bad but it wasn't our favorite. Tasted like spicy meatloaf with a bit of an off flavor for us. We thought grilled jalapenos/salt & pepper in making the burgers would have been good alone. Liked the pepperjack cheese. Finally, we ended up topping with bq sauce to help them. Thanks anyway.

This recipe should be called Spicy Meatloaf Burger. I was unimpressed. It is just meatloaf people. Now I like meatloaf a lot, but not as a burger.

This was just okay for us.  Really not a lot of flavor which is surprising considering the amount of ingredients.  I used 80/20 for more flavor but it still wasn't happening.  Thanks for posting the recipe though

These burgers were amazing.  We reduced the ground beef to 2 lbs.  (4 pounds of beef for 8 servings seemed excessive.)  We kept all the other ingredient portions as specified and did not roast the peppers.  We followed the one beer per side grilling instructions carefully and topped with additional A1 sauce and the Horseradish Sauce on this site from Carol46.  YUM!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Sorry, but we did not love these.  They are really juicy which was great, but for me the flavor of the corn chips threw everything off.

I hate to be the one giving a bad review among so many good ones, but.... Made 4 burgers for my fiance and I last night (expecting leftovers, of course!). I have been eyeing this recipe for some time now, and am sad to say that after finally getting around to tyrig this, we were sorely disappointed with the outcome. I love all of the ingredients separately, but found them to not work well when mixed together. My best description of this burger is "meatloaf mush." For all of the effort involved (i.e. roasting/sweating the peppers and grilling the burgers - which I did on my indoor Crate & Barrel grill), the end result was mediocre at best. I guess it didn't help that the friend jalapeno slices we served alongside our burgers were also mediocre (which is too bad since they would have paired very nicely together!). Oh well! I don't expect every recipe to be a winner.... Thanks for sharing your idea regardless, Jeff :)

Whoa!  I halved the recipe, used two jalapenos and about set my mouth on fire!  I like spicy, but this was very spicy!  Maybe I just got a burger with more jalapeno than others.  I still love the recipe and will be keeping it in my file for future use.  Only sub I made was italian bread crumbs in place of the crushed fritos.  (but would try them if I had them around the next time I made these!)

These had a pretty good taste. But I thought the steak sauce and the Worcestershire sauce were fighting against each other too much. Next time I'll skip the  steak sauce.

The best burger ever!  I used Spicy Doritos instead of Fritos because I forgot to buy Fritos and only a 1/4 of the jalapenos because I had some wimps to feed.  Still the best burger ever. :-)

Made this for G/F and myself.....OMG, what a flavor!! Not quite as hot and spicy as expected, more... well...don't know how to explain it, between the seasoning and the peppers, just wow.
I did reduce the size of the burger to 1/2lbs patties. If you do this just know they cook through faster than solid beef patties but I like my beef extrememly rare, usually uncooked in the centers, was disapointed the first time when the centers looked fully cooked so fast, but was so very happy with how juicy and tender they still were!

Yum! I made these for Monday Night Football..Go Bears! We have renamed these burgers Bears Burgers. I cut the recipe in half and it made 6 hugh burgers. I also stuffed the cheese inside the center of the each buger for a cheezy surprise! I than placed them in the freezer for about 20 minutes to firm them up a little. Next time I will try bread crumbs instead of corn chips. Monday Night Football will never be the same.

ENJOY!

Oh this is sooo good!!! I didn't have fritos so I used crushed white corn chips. Other than that I followed the direction to a "T" including the grilling part;0) Can't wait to make again...thank you Jeff!!

I really liked these burgers. It doesnt say in the recipe what to do with the jalapenos after chopping them...so I guess that it meant to mix them in with the meat with everything else. These were nice and tangy with a little heat. These are great to form into patties and freeze in the freezer, so when you want some for dinner you can just pull them out and don't have to do any work.  I didn't make them as big as the recipe states at all! Those would make some HUGE burgers. I just made regular sized ones.  I will be making these again.

You really need a hearty bun to stand up to these burgers, I made whole wheat potato buns. Submitted a pic, hopefully they will publish it.  I substituted cheddar for pepperjack (forgot to buy it.)  The burgers are good, almost like meatloaf.  I didn't add the seeds and they were not spicy, next time I'll add the seeds.

This is an amazing burger! It is by far and away the best burger I have had of yet! I always exclude the tabasco sauce due to the fact that I am not big on the taste, but always add just a touch more steak sauce and worchestershire sauce and salt and pepper. I usually use provolone or chipolte cheddar cheese on top..but , this is sooo good. I make at least once a week now.

This was an amazing cheeseburger!!! We cut the recipe in half because there is only two of us but we double the fritos and we added bacon. It is an explosion of flavor! Will make again for sure! ps. we cooked ours on the stove and it came out just as good.

I dont eat meat, but I made these for my in-laws. They said it was the best, most flavorful, and juicy burger they have ever had!! I used the same recipe for myself, and just mixed it with the morningstar veggie crumbles. The flavor was delicious, but the veggie crumbles dont hold shape real well! It turns out more like a sloppy joe, but still worth it! Thank you! We have used this recipe several times!

I would rate this 10 stars! Sooooo good!! Really nice kick with the jalapenos (I used 1/2 small can instead of fresh). These were seriously the very best burgers I have ever made!!! Leave out the spicy stuff and it's a great regular burger too!!

There were a few reviews in here that haven't even tried it, or just went by the picture and gave it a low rating, that is very unfair and a waste of time for everyone who reads the reviews...that is just stupid if I must say...me and my family loved it. Thank you Jeff for a great recipe : )

We didn't care too much for these. There isn't a great flavor with all the ingredients. That was a disappointment. I didn't have the fresh jalapenos but subbed ones from the jar. I wouldn't make again.

These burgers were incedible.  We halved the recipe but still used an entire egg and they turned out perfectly.  I honestly can't think of one thing I would've changed. I think these might be the best burgers I've ever had and that's saying a lot. The Fritos were a great addition, you coudl just taste a hint of them in the background. Because I love Tabasco, my girlfriend added a little extra. They were still mild enough that she could eat them easily. GREAT RECIPE!

My oldest son made this whole recipe on his own. We had to make a couple changes due to what we had on hand. We use diced mild green chilies instead of fresh jalapenos (about two tablespoons), used Frank's instead of Tabasco and chili-cheese Fritos. Not bad. We might play with the recipe to make it a little different next time but definitely tasty! We were very proud of him.

we loved these.. scaled it down to 2 servings.. so i left out the egg.. didn't feel like it tasted like meatloaf.. or maybe i've never had meatloaf that tasted as awesome as this.. either way we really enjoyed the dish.. used ground turkey instead of ground beef and just chopped up some fresh jalapeno.. didn't bother roasting it.. ty so much for the recipe

Perfect! I no longer make regular burgers. I have made these burgers many times,the jalapenos are not over powering. I use a 3lbs of burger and dont change anything else. The fritos is a nice touch and for the one who thought they were soggy well just crush them. Thanks Jeff

It is not as hot as I thought.  I actually will spice it up next time by adding more jalapenos.  But, overall, it's excellent.  We used American cheese instead to take away some of the expected sting.  Instead, I'll go with the recipe as written next time; we'll use pepperjack cheese.

Make no mistake, these are spicy. As spicy as they are they are also that good. We brought these to tailgate at our local AA baseball game one night along with two other types of burgers. These went first.

My husband loved this one. The recipe makes HUGE burgers. I halved the ingredients and made four burgers but thought I could easily have made 6 or 7 smaller but still satisfying burgers (but then I guess they wouldn't really have been Bronco Burgers, since part of the fun is the huge size).
They have a good, spicy kick, and this is a good recipe for improvising. We didn't have steak sauce or Fritos, so we used chipotle barbecue sauce and barbecue chips instead.

Just made these and it's yummy! I halved the recipe and made 7 good size burgers.
I didn't have any Fritos so, I used cool ranch Doritos instead.  I also sauteed the onions before mixing into the meat mixture. It's a very savory recipe. I would definitely make these again. I used 2 huge jalapenos but didn't really feel much heat. So,I topped it off with some Siracha hot sauce and Man, that is good stuff!!

These burgers were good.  I actually expected them to be a bit more flavorful given the large amount of ingredients, but the flavor definitely wasn't overwhelming.  I can't say it's the best burger I've ever had, but they were good and my family liked them.  As you would expect, the fritos softened up, and I didn't really notice them in the burger.  So, when I heated up the left overs, I added a pile to the top to give it that extra crunch.    This recipe isn't one that I would go out of my way to make, but if I have the ingredients, I wouldn't mind giving it a second try.

Wonderful. Scaled down the jalapeño by alot and used havarti cheese instead. A big hit for the whole family.

Fantastic! we halved the recipie for our small family, and used some fresh ground cabrito and cooked it on the george foreman grill. We will make this again for sure. Also, we removed all the seeds from the peppers, next time for more spice Id like to leave some in.

My family loved these!! Perfect for football. 4lbs was a lot but we froze them and used them again for another game. :) Served them with Fritos. I also made another batch with ground turkey, eh, not as good, but I still liked 'em. They were meant to be beefy. lol

I love this recipe. Even without the roasted peppers (sometimes I'm just too lazy) it has a great kick. Such a nice change of pace from the usual burgers with onion mix in them.

I forgot the jalapenos at the grocery store, so I used the jar kind I had in the fridge. I also used less since I was making a mini patty for my 1 year old. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. This was awesome. I now have a go-to burger recipe. Simple to make, but so, so, so good.

I thought of it as a burger for someone with a cowboy appetite--no horse involed.  Except to ride to get back to camp for supper.  Good burger for a big appetire.

My family doesn't do spicy too well. I modified this recipe somewhat. It was a good burger. I only used 2 jalapenos (seeded),  doubled the egg, steak sauce, minced white onion, oregano, corn chips, and Worcestershire sauce. I replaced the garlic salt with 4 minced cloves of garlic and added 1/4 teaspoon minced fresh cilantro. I cooked it on the George Foreman grill for between 8 - 10 minutes. It had a good flavor.

I thought it was very good and the egg, to me, only made it a little more moist, especially if using leaner gr. beef.  Love the spiciness!  As I've never been fond of any kind of ground beef being "pink", I prefer my burgers with no undercooked  portions, keeping it safe.  Delicious HAMBURGERS!

5/5 I made these tonight and they not only blew my wife and daughter but my mom and dad loved them as well. I used A-1 and country Bob's instead of worster I didn't roast jalapinos didn't have any Iused some slices out of a jar. I used montreal steak seasoning and Frank's red hot sauce, I used a red onion instead of white. I made 10 balls instead of 8 with 3.88 lbs of ground chuck. I cooked till medium well and they were very juicy and tender, my new favorite burger recipe!!!

I'd never used corn chips or bread crumbs in a burger before, which is what mainly caught my attention in this recipe.  I used tortilla chips, and it gives it an interesting texture and taste.  I worried it about it tasting like meatloaf, which I hate, but I don't think it does at all.  I had no steak sauce, so I used some Lawry's marinade instead, and I only used a pound of ground beef but kept the spice amounts the same or even increased them.  It still doesn't taste that strong to me, and I added cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes too.  I used red bell pepper instead of jalapenos, so I assume the jalapeno is the heat factor everyone mentions.  Using a more mild pepper may help those who find it a bit too hot.  Mine turned out tasty, but not uncomfortably hot.  Topped it with barbecue sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmm!.. This recipe was my inspiration but I used some leftover chopped steak, omit the egg.  I know, but it was delicious with the jalapenos it had a Mexican Torta taste.  I used the seasonings and some shredded cheese!  All my guys loved them!   Next time I'll try them with ground beef!.. :)

OMG.......This was AWESOME!!!!! No Lie!! I made with 96/4 beef and I followed the recipe to a tee, excepted omitted the frito corn chips. I did add my own twist to this recipe as I added pepper jack cheese, grated and stuffed the middle of the patty with it. The burgers were 6-8 inches in daimeter and two+ inches thick!! They were incredible!!! Best burger I have ever had at home or at a restraunt!!! We had left over beef "mixture" so i put in a platic bag, refridged at the next day I did the same thing, althoughh the second's day was more spicier as the jalopenos marinated in the beef for 24hrs..... WAS AWESOME!!!! will plann to marinate the jalopenos in the beef again!!! Thank you! :)))))

This is a great, spicy burger. I scaled it down for 1 pound of beef to make three hamburgers. I omitted the hot sauce and added a little extra steak sauce in its place. I also omitted the oregano. Instead of grilling the jalapenos, I used half a small can of hot, diced jalapenos and incorporated them into the burger. The recipe never states what to do with them. We enjoyed them, even my 6 year old! He loves spicy food. For this burger he had to do one bite, then a gulp of water, another bite, another gulp of water...and so on! :) We'll make them again, thanks!

Very good!  Not convinced all the ingredients are completely necessary, particulary the orgeno and worchestsire sauce.  Fritos can be replaced with bread crumbs, so you don't have to buy special for the recipe.  I'll definately make it again.

YUMMMMMMMY! I made these with soy hamburger (its the raw form in a tube like sausage). They were incredible. I added some seasoned breadcrumbs to thicken it a bit as I only made 1 lb of "meat" and used an entire egg by mistake which made them a bit too moist but the breadcrumbs helped! 1 lb of "meat" made about 5 burgers that were all good size. When halving this recipe it says it makes 2 burgers but that wasnt true in my case. I also didn't grill or sweat the jalapenos. I just minced them with a knife and added them right in the mixture. I pan fried the burgers in a bit of olive oil on the stove too instead of grilling them. I will for sure make these again! Great recipe!

Followed this exactly except for the Jalapeno's (didn't have any in the house) and they had a HUGE "wow" factor from the family.  My kids said they were the best burger "ever" and my husband, who never cares about the ratings, said I HAD to give a 5 star for these burgers!!  Very tasty and we fried up some sweet potato fries for a yummy supper.  This one is a keeper!

I made turkey burgers with this recipe...used a habanero-butter injection marinade instead of jalapenos, doubled the rest of the ingredients, & used minced garlic instead of powder. Made a very yummy burger (and almost twice as many as written because 1/2 pound burgers is just ridiculous in my opinion). Will definitely make again when I have fresh peppers on hand (that would have given it the extra kick it was lacking).

We made these last night (I put them together/he grilled).  They were as great as all the rave reviews said they were.  This will be "the" burgers from now on.  Had to knock the quantities down as I only had 1 1/2#'s of meat.  Next time I'll make the full amount and freeze them all made up and ready to go.  Thanks for a burger we will be anxious to serve.  Oh, hubby did agree with your flipping method!

Oh, yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about! We may never grill "staight up" burgers again. Wife and kids even fingered the few crumbs left on the plate. Used A1 for a bit more bite and red onion for its sweeter taste. Outstanding! Thanks for a great recipe that will be in my family for years to come.

The ingredients give these burgers a wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe except I made smaller (1/4 lb.) burgers based on preference. If you remove the seeds from the jalepenos they won't be very spicy (safe enough for kids), but leaving them in gives a nice kick. Thanks for sharing!

These were good. Better than the plain burgers I usually make, but nothing to write home about. If I decide to make them again I will add more peppers for more spice.

A hit! I was craving burgers, but I wanted something different. Since it's a little too cold to grill, I decided to make these indoors. I roasted the peppers under the broiler (you have to slice them in half to do this), then I added 1/4 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the meat mixture, and cooked the burgers in a frying pan. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Served with a pickle and waffle fries on the side. Absolutely delicious! This recipe makes really big, filling burgers - I could only eat half of mine. I will certainly make this again!

Made these for husband and friends.  They went over very well.  Could have been spicier..but I have a difficult time judging how hot the jalapenos are going to be.  I used a food processor to chop jalapenos.

I made this hamburger last 4th of July with other veriations of different hamburgers and this one I had to actully steal and hide it so my husband could get one. Excellent! We love spicy food so this was a hit.  I used frozen green chilis that you can get in the supper market obviously in the frozen food section. I like things that are easy.  Thanks!

These were AWESOME! I didn't have steak sauce, or fritos so I just mixed a little bbq with liquid smoke, and used white corn tortilla chips, and they still turned out so good! Like others have said before, best burger I've ever had!

If you are trying to find a recipe to change up your typical burger, this is the one! I use the chili cheese fritos and even my picky grandma who does not like burgers likes this one. I will be making these again and again!

I made this all by myself, with just a little help from my mom and dad. I grilled it all by myself, and it turned out great!! Well, not great. AWESOME!!!!!!!! I would reccomend this to anyone. Especially when you're out tailgatin', or when you are at a game. I put green chiles in it, because we didnt have any jalapenos on hand. I also used Franks instead of Tabasco, and Chili Cheese Fritos. It worked out really well, it was good, and my family said it was awesome, too!! And all this on my first night of me cooking for my family.

I absolutely love this recipe and make it at every BBQ we have where burgers are on the menu. I do add a little more jalapeño, crushed Fritos, and some fresh pressed garlic but otherwise stick to the recipe.

Superb burger, but make it juicier by mashing 1-2 pieces of white bread with a fork in a 1/4 cup of milk.

These were ok. With all the fantastic ingredients, I was expecting them to have more flavor. They were actually sort of bland to me! But they weren't bad.

The only thing I change is instead of Fritos I use Nacho Cheese Doritos.  Adds a nice cheesy flavor.  Oh, and of coarse i garnish with 3 strips of applewood smoked bacon.

Ooh, so good!!!  I planned to make these burgers for the holiday and chickened out.  The negative reviews scared me.  The Bronco Burger in no way tastes like meatloaf.  The only change I made to this recipe was to increase the Fritos, go easy on the oregano and make homemade steak sauce.  Will I make them again, you bet!!!  Thanks Chef!!

My husband and I did not care for these burgers. He disliked them more than I did. They did not turn out well, unfortunately. I thought the other users were exaggerating when they said it tastes like a meatloaf burger - they weren't exaggerating. We also didn't like how you could taste the steak sauce - it was almost overwhelming (and i followed the recipe). Strange. Will not be making again, but thanks for submitting it anyway!

These burgers were very tasty!  I always read reviews, and most people said they were too spicy with all the jalepenos.  So, I took seeds out of half, and left them in the others.  Found it wasn't spicy at all (we like spicy).  That was my only regret.  Great recipe.

Excellent burgers!!!  Don't be afraid of the 5 jalapenos cause after roasting them it takes some of the heat way.  Oh and the beer flip the burger beer take it off timing is perfect!!

I made these tonight for my husband and "picky" kids.  They raved over these hamburgers.  Definitely a little spicy, but that's just the way we like them!  I did take the lazy way out and used sliced jalapenos from a jar, that I minced in the food processor with the onion, but it was still incredible!  I served these on toasted onion buns with sauteed onions and peppers and sliced avocados.  This is our new favorite hamburger recipe.  Thanks Jeff!

I usually never follow a recipe exactly. This one is no exception, I used onion powder instead of fresh, soy sauce, about 2 tsps of oregano(a pinch seemed point-less!)about 2lbs of beef,and no chips.and chipotle style hot sauce. Everything eles I kept the same. This burger was yummy! I LOVE the way the oregano tasted, and it wasn't spicy at all(then again, I eat whole,fresh jalapenos w/ seeds pretty much every night  w my dinner) , but it had a good charred flavor from the peppers!  No flavor stood out, but all flavors were wonderful together! I served the burgers on toasted english muffins, and put green chile jelly on mine! Sooooo yummy!!! The only "manly" thing about this burger was that I wanted about 3 of them, but refrained and just had one with a veggie salad. THX for recipe! :)

Good recipe, but not worth all of the prep. Lipton soup mix is just as good added to ground beef with jalapenos.

This is a fantastic burger recipe.  It is one of the top 5 burgers I've ever had,  and I've had a few.  I cooked it as written with a few minor adjustment.  If you are afraid of the heat,  cook it without the peppers.  I'm sure you will still love it.  The only thing I did different is cook it on a Treager Pellet Barbecue.  They tend to accentuate the flavor of foods somewhat.  But I'm sure that any way you cook them,  they will be great.  The beer timing method was spot on.

This was an extremely good burger.  I guess I should've used less than four large jalepeno's because my two children who like hot stuff could barely finish them!!  The flavor was really good.  We will definitely be making these again but with less jalepenos!!

Delish. Used 3 jalapenos instead of 5 just so no one was too overwhelmed. 5 probably would have been okay. Be sure to dice the onion into small enough pieces. Fritos is a fun touch. Impress your friends and family...present these burgers.

I thought this was an awesome burger..was a little afraid of how much jalapeno to add so went on the milder side. Didn't have the steak sauce but that is the only thing I didn't do according to the recipe. The pepperjack cheese added another dimension of spiciness but not overwhelmingly so. I definitely will make these again.

Made this awhile ago and it was pretty tasty. Boyfriend can't eat super spicy food so i had to leave those out of his patties. Definately not healthy, but very tasty!

My husband LOVES this recipe.  I usually do the prep-work and he does the grilling.  I like to add 1/2 package of dry ranch dressing mix instead of salt.  Dress burgers with cheddar-jack, bacon, and avacado -- YUM!!

this is good, however we prefer beef hamburgers without fillers such as  breadcrumbs, eggs or whatever... Less meatloaf-like.  I wont make again.. the fritos had a aftertaste... was kind of odd.

This is the BEST burger I've ever eaten!!  Although I didnt find it to be very hot, everyone else in my family thought it was fine so we'll just leave the measurements the same.  We are going to try this again this time leaving out the chips & egg because we felt it gave the burger a meatloaf type texture which we didnt care for.  All in all; TASTE is PERFECT!!!  Texture is too soft for our family, making it tonight without egg/chips, I'll let you all know how it turns out.

I will start by saying that I made these in smaller portions. I made 3 out of 1 lb ground beef. I added 1/2 C jalapenos, 1/2C onions. Threw both into the food processor. I used 3 pieces of cooked bacon crumbled into beef. 1 T Cholula, 1 t minced garlic, 1 T Worcestershire and 1 t liquid smoke. Grill on preheated high grill for 8 min per side. Serve on grilled Texas toast.

As fantastic as everyone claims! Wonderfully moist and flavorful. Skipped the potato chips to keep fat, salt and preservatives at a minimum - used bread crumbs and turned out equally well! Delish!

This was a good and easy burger, but I have had better. There was just no "Wow!" factor to them for me, and I prefer the "Bacon Wrapped Burgers" from this site. My husband really seemed to enjoy them though, so I would probably make this again.

These were great, especially topped with lettuce, pickles, and bbq sauce!  These are huge burgers, so you can make more burgers than the recipe states if you make them a bit smaller.

Excellent!!! My husband and sons loved it too! The beer was a great compliment to these burgers. I think that next time I make this recipe I will spice it up a bit, and the men in my family have voted to change the name to "Buccaneer Burgers" sorry Denver.

I think these were the best burgers I've ever made, although I have to admit, I used canned, chopped jalapenos and I didn't put the steak sauce in because I didn't have any.  Next time, I'll put the steak sauce in and my guess is that they'll be even better!!

Followed recipe exactly, except I accidentally left out the hot sauce. Regardless, my three teenage boys and my husband all went CRAZY over these burgers!! I've been a vegetarian for over 30 years, but their reactions almost made me want to take a bite :)

Probably hands down the best burger I have ever eaten. The only thing different was we used only 2 jalapeños but I think when I make this again I’m going to do different jalapeños. Love the flavor but not the heat. But it is sooooo good!!!!

excellent burgers. followed the recipe, burgers were moist and flavorful. the jalapenos were not as hot as i thought they would be. my son and husband loved them, i like things a little spicier so i had a hot sauce-mayo sauce with mine. will definitely make these again. thanks for the recipe.

These tasted really good. They got a little undone but might have been that the size of egg I used wasn't enough to bind the mixture. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks.

Very good, I used Ranch Fritos, sadly they don't have much flavor on their own, so next time I'm gonna use Cool Ranch doritos.  I also bet Chili Fritos would work well too

While it was tasty, it was somewhat difficult for those with modest sized mouths to eat due to its thickness.  We will retry on a "smaller scale".

These are wonderful.  I've now made them several times.  If you do not want to blow the top of your head off with heat, be sure to thoroughly clean the seeds out of the jalapeños.  I use a half of sweet onion finely chopped.  I know this is more than 1/4 cup.  4 pounds of beef makes 12 nice fat patties.  I use a hamburger press so they are pretty even in size.  I then vacuum seal and always have them on hand when hungry family stops by for something to eat.  Thank you for a super recipe.

Made these for a family bbq.  Since I was feed little one and big I did half the batch with no jalapenos, but kept the full 5 for the other half (inadvertently).  Roasting the jalapenos and taking out the seeds does indeed pull down the heat significantly.  Went with Chili Cheese Fritos but they were not noticeable, probably increase the Fritos and put them in the mix only immediately prior to grilling.  Overall they were a hit which I will make again!!

I just wouldn't label this a manly burger but  I'd call it a burger of flavor. Some of us women like heat on our burgers too. By varying size of burger, one can find the size appropriate per person as these are shaped by hand and weight can vary.
Like the combo of toppings on the burger.

"Ground Beef?!"  I thought this was supposed to be a "Bronco" Burger!  LMAO
Just kidding.  Sounds good.  One of the best I made was   loosely formed and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, grilled over charcoal with wet hickory chips gently smoking them.  Melt in your mouth delicious.

Meh.  I should have known something was going to be off when the description referred to this as a "manly burger" but the directions are advising people to cook for 10-15 min until "well done".  Prime way to ruin some good beef.  I made this as indicated but cooked for about 7 minutes total (i prefer my burgers medium - medium well).  This tasted like meatloaf between a bun.  Not impressed.

AWESOME BURGER! I'm a total burger snob, and I was honestly surprised at how much I liked these. Can't wait to make them again. 


Take away the Fritos and jalapeños, and these would be just your standard, over-seasoned, meatloaf-wannabe burgers. However, thanks to the jalapeños and Fritos, this recipe results in a truly unique, interesting, and most importantly, tasty burger.  

Some specifics on the recipe:
- I took the seeds out of the jalapeños and the result was a very light spiciness. It was detectable but it could have used more. Next time I'll leave some seeds in. I'd also add a little more hot sauce. I was stingy this time. 
- This was the first time I blackened and skinned peppers. I wasn't good at it but it came out fine. It took longer than I expected, so for other newbies, just FYI. Also I broiled mine in the oven. Googled how. There are multiple ways to do this. 
- I didn't measure anything. It's not an exact science. I used 2 pounds of meat and backed off the rest of the ingredients accordingly. 
- I'm not good at mincing onions so the onion pieces were a little bigger, but it was totally fine and in fact good that way. 
- I can't imagine grilling these for 15 minutes. Too long. Recipe says 10-15. I guess it depends on the heat level but I cooked these on high at first, got a good sear, flipped at 4 minutes, lowered heat a bit and cooked another 5. They were well done. Still juicy and really good, but next time I'll cook them less. I suggest you just grill thes

Best burgers I've ever had. I did not use the jalapeños because I did not want to waste charcoal grilling them then having to make the patties while the grill gets cold. 

Other than that small thing, these were fantastic!

AH-Mazing! Ok, if you don't do spice, replace with canned chilis, or at the very least roast a green pepper. Man this is good! Unfortunately, we went shopping before I looked up the recipe. But, seems versatile; used Salt&Vinegar chips, mixed bbq sauce & A1, and used canned chilis because I didnt want to kill my wonderful mother in law. I did add white, cayanne, and black pepper, and a large handful of mozzarella, and for spiciness factor, I'd say it's like a 2. I needed something.... Thank you, and congrats to you Broncos fans for the superbowl (but go Hawks!) :)

Thanks for the recipe.  The only change I made was including some of the jalapeño seeds since we like things hot.  Husband and 15 year old son loved them!

Followed the directions exactly but used 2lbs of beef and added garlic powder.  Agree with most,  it's the only burger recipe I'll use for now on! Thanks for sharing!??

My boyfriend is now obsessed with these burgers.  He is the condiment king but I gave him one with cheese only on a toasted bun and he didn't even notice, he just had me make him two more which is quite possibly the most I've ever seen him eat.  I also loved them but as someone who eats a lot of extremely spicy food on a regular, I could have easily doubled the Tobasco.......and then some.

Made some changes to adapt to what I had on hand. Didn't put the jalapeños in the mix as I have a little guy. Instead I sautéed them in balsamic and put on top. Added the steak sauce, egg, woshtishire sauce, garlic salt, 1 cup of Monterey Jack cheese, and a half packet of onion soup mix. I also crushed up half a tube of toasteds crackers . Also sautéed an onion and added to the mix.  Served alongside some sautéed sweet peppers. So good, will make again! Thanks for the recipe. I know people get irritated when others change the recipes but I love taking a recipe and making it my own. Thanks for all the great ideas!

These were amazing, I made them for my sons birthday party,  they were a success!!  My husband and family LOVES specialty burgers so they are not the easiest crowd to impress but this recipe did.   If not told I don't think anyone could guess the addition of Fritos.   10/10 if you are considering this recipe do your self a favor and try it.

A great burger with lots of flavor.  I scaled this back using only one pound of burger.  I had to use sharp cheddar as we were out of pepperjack cheese.   I made smaller burgers and we didn't need a half-pound burger along with the other items we had.  The flavor is great, and I would make these again.  Served with 'Sausage Jalapeno Poppers' from AR and grilled peppers, onions and potatoes.  Loved that all items were cooked on the grill.  Made for easy-peasy clean up.

I made these delicious burgers for dinner last night. Everyone loved them! I didn't have Worcester, steak sauce, or onion, but was still amazing! Very spicy, so if you can't handle some kick, watch out for those peppers. Looking forward to trying this recipe again with all the ingredients and a grill!

This is our go to burger recipe. We love it! The only change we make is that we just chop fresh jalapeños rather than charring them. We like spicy food but it’s definitely not overpowering. Highly recommend!

These burgers are awesome. I have made these a couple times now and everyone loves them. I used A-1 for the steak sauce, and Frank's hot sauce for the pepper sauce. These are a new favorite.

Although we omitted the sausage, the onions and the fritos chips, we found our ways around them. We chopped the jalapenos and added into the meat before cooking, and we used the fritos to top the burger. Delicious, leftovers lasted in the fridge, best burger I've ever had. I'll add some bacon next time!

This is my favorite burger of all time. The only thing I changed is the Fritos. I used spicy Fritos and also added extra spices since I'm a big spice fan. So happy I found this. I make it for boxing fights, basket ball games etc. I haven't met one person that didn't ask for the recipe after they ate one.

really great!  i made for just 1 lb and adjusted the measurements accordingly and still tasted awesome!  i did add some liquid smoke (1 tsp for 1 lb of meat)...next time i think i'd add a little less b/c i feel like the smokiness overtook some of the more subtle flavors.  i added extra fritos (chili cheese) and fresh oregano and parsley.  i omitted salt b/c the worcestershire and fritos were quite enough!  thanks for the great recipe!  will definitely make again!

Made this exactly as stated, and there was absolutely nothing different about it than a plain burger, other than it being soggy.  Although, if you keep the jalapeno seeds, it does add the heat.  That is the only difference.  I'm very confused about all the reviews on here.  I was so excited when I was making them after what was said, and then I ate them and wondered if I am missing taste buds or something.

I halfed the recipe, but followed it exactly except  I used Jalapenos from a jar.  It was mildly spicy, but I hate having my mouth burned, even a little.  So I didn't eat but half of one.  My husband, who likes spicy food, said they were OK, but nothing special.  I thought they would have more flavor, but I don't think there was enough sauce, etc in the recipe.

Hmm, well these were good but I expected so much more. I scaled it back to 4 servings so that may have changed the flavor a little. I might try these again...will have to see.

My wife and I served these at our "Survivor" party a few weeks back. I substituted the Fresh Jalapenos with the canned variety. They are not for the weak at heart or stomach! I loved this burger and will serve it again.

Made these almost exactly as written.  The only adjustment I made was to substitute beef boullion powder instead of salt.  Chopped the grilled and peeled peppers and incorporated into meat mixture.  I downscaled this to 4 servings and still got 5 jumbo burgers.  Wrapped and froze 2 of them,  Can't wait to make these again, we loved them!

Great Burger! My family is a huge grilling family and my dad is very picky on how he likes his burgers. I made the patties and he grilled them. When he took the first bite he absolutely loved it! One of his favorite burgers!

I love this burger. After eating this one all others taste bland to me. I love the spice this recipe adds. It seems like a lot of ingredients for a cheeseburger, but it's fun to make and even better to eat.

Mmmmmm! I loved this burger. My family had mixed opinions. A little too hot for my daughter, even without the jalepeno. I will make these again. This is one of my favorites.

Read this recipe last night, had dreams of juicy burgers....so I made them tonight. Better than my WILDEST dreams! I didn't have fresh jalapenos (shame on me) BUT did substitute a can of roasted mild chilis. I added a bit more hot sauce to compensate. They were delicious, so delicious. Thank you for this awesome burger. I made the whole recipe, cooked 3 for DH and I and froze the rest individually.

These were really good, but if you make them the recommended size their just too big.  I also put extra corn chips in. Yummy :-)

very delicious!  Try with homemade coleslaw as a side it mellows out the heat from the burger.  Will definitely have again.

My son is extremely picky about food and loves to cook. He likes southwestern flavors so I thought I'd try this.  This burger is amazing!!  Best we've ever eaten! Pretty easy too despite the ingredient list.

Sounds great.  I am assuming that the grilled jalapenos are added in Step 2 w/all the other ingredients?

I made this recipe without the jalepenos because we had kids and older folks at our party.  I used Lee & Perrin's Steak Sauce instead of Heinz and Red Hot Sauce instead of Tabasco.  I also used 1/2 the beef but the same amount of other ingredients and they were well spiced but not too powerful.  I had some trouble keeping them together.  I think an additional egg would be beneficial and maybe some more corn chips (I used crushed tortilla chips instead of Fritos).  Almost everyone liked these, even the kids.  This is a good recipe.

Loved these burgers!  Made them for a group and they were demolished!  Quick and easy prep...definitely worth the 2 mins to mix the ingredients.  We skipped the jalapenos this time because I had a few guests that didn't like spicy, but will def include them next time.

I got to play hostess for 4th of July, and I remember getting confused looks when I replied to people's questions of what I was making.  Everybody kept saying it seemed like a lot of trouble to go into burgers.  That is, until they tried them.  One of our friends even ate one that had fallen on the ground.  Guess that means people liked them.  I know I did.

We made these without the jalepenos, and accidentally left out the egg.  My 4 year old thought his burger was "yummy".  Next time, I'd like to try the jalepenos.  The pepper jack cheese was a great idea.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My kids love this recipe. We tried it for the first time several months ago and they're still asking for it often. I leave the jalapenos out of the meat I grill for the kids.

This was a nice change, of pace.  Nicely spiced with a kick. And that remark about it being a 'manly man's burger for tailgating"?  This would be GREAT at a CHIEFS game.  (He's right, it was very filling.)
I'll definately fix this again.

Excellent! My husband was extremely impressed and raved about these burgers. I halved the recipe and only used 1 jalapeno because that was all I had. It was perfect...will definitely make again!

These burgers were delicious and a nice change from the typical burger.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had trouble roasting the peppers (the wind kept blowing out the grill).  I therefore  used the peppers without fully roasting them.  We like spicy food and therefore left the pepper seeds in).  Grilled the burgers over mesquite wood and added our favorite condiments.  Yum!
