I loved this twist on oatmeal. I only had fresh turmeric so I used my smallest shredder and it worked out just fine. I did add 2 packets of Truvia and a splash of milk. I did not care for the peanut butter in the oatmeal, it seemed it was competing with the turmeric. I will leave it out next time I make it. Other than that, I loved it.

Love this. Even with or without the peanut butter. I don't need sugar, it's healthy. It curbs my appetite.

I could use more sweet! But it wasnâ€™t bad. My husband put honey and blueberries in his!
