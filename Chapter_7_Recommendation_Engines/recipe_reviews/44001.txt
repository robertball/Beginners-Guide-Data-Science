After having lived in Mexico for seven years, and having been taught to make pozole by my Mexican mother-in-law, I was a little hesitant to try a pozole that didn't use the traditional pork, since pozole is one of my all time favorites.  BUT!  This recipe is great!  I tried it to use up my leftover Thanksgiving turkey and the soup is absolutely fabulous.  I will make one suggestion...traditional pozole is always served with shredded cabbage (or lettuce), diced fresh onion, fresh lime juice and a nice big bottle of hot sauce, so each individual can customize his bowl.  I put these items on the side and boy, did we enjoy our meal!

This is not a good Pozole recipe.  The original recipe goes for pork, chicken and even a vegetarian version with no meat/poultry at all.  It does not have beans, or jalapeños or anything the recipe stands for.  Maybe it is a good caserole of something, but Pozole never...

Absolutely fantastic.  I used the whole turkey carcass with a little meat left on it and cooked it down till it fell apart. Removed the bones and then followed the rest of the receipe.  There were 5 fussy eaters at this meal and they all admitted that they were surprised and they all had 2nd's.  We found this should absolutely be served with good cold micro beer.  We will make this every year with the leftover turkey and will really look forward to it.

It was a very good soup but definitely not what I would consider "pozole".  And I think using either beans or hominy would make the recipe better.  The texture of both mixed together is just a little strange (the beans were too soft next to the hominy).

I dont know how this compares to what one would consider "authentic" posole, but this is a darn good soup!  My wife was a bit skeptical, and she hates hominy, so she used corn, but my whole family enjoyed this one.  It is very flavorful and aromatic.  It has great texture.  We added a little grated cheddar when serving, and I just kept going back for more.

Oh YUUUUMMMMMMM!!!  I made this with leftover chicken instead of turkey and used chicken broth as well.  The only thing I did different (other than that) with this recipe is I bought the wrong peppers by mistake- I bought a can of serrano peppers which I think are hotter than poblano peppers and I know are hotter than jalepeno which I somehow forgot to buy (oops) so I didn't use the whole can because I didn't want to ruin the recipe in case they were too hot- anyway- it turned out fine- the flavors mixed WONDERFULLY and this will be a recipe I will use over and over (maybe a new years tradition)- I served with hot sauce, sour cream and tortilla chips.  THANK YOU!!!! I will try with turkey and I will also try with pork in the future too. :)

Very good posole! In my family we traditionally have posole on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day so the idea of having it on New Year's Day is a new one, but a good one too.  Another good idea is to make the posole with chicken and red chile sauce, fresh lemons and chopped onions, and dried oregano.  Dee-lish.  This is a very good version too.

Great soup!  Pretty much followed the recipe and it was delicious.  Obviously it's not a traditional pozole, but hey it tastes really good, isn't that what matters!

Even as a picky eater, my husband finds this quite delicious.  Easy to make, tastes great and authentic (to what I've had living with a family in Cuernavaca, Mexico) even using turkey.

I agree with another reviewer who commented on the traditional recipes for posole, but I have to say that I thought this recipe was okay. For someone that has never had posole (my husband and his parents) they liked it just fine. I did leave out the poblanos, because I didn't know what kind of heat they would add to the soup and my husband and his parents can't handle much spice. Otherwise, I made this recipe as written. I like that the beans and hominy make this a very filling soup.

I made this using my leftover Thanksgiving turkey carcass.  It was absolutely delicious.  Surpasses my usual turkey noodle soup recipe for sure.  It's a nice change of pace.  I started by boiling the carcass until the meat was mostly all off the bone.  Drained it and picked out the good meat.  I used the broth and meat without measuring.  I didn't have poblano chile peppers or green chile peppers, so I used a dried ancho chile that I had.  I only had one can of white beans rather than two, but it seemed like enough.  This definitely needs toppings.  We let each person top their own with cilantro, lime, lettuce, sharp cheddar, onion and tortilla chips.  Yum!  They totally improve the soup.  Without them it would seem dull.  With them it is delicious!

Great way to use turkey--something definitely different and delicious.  I had all the ingredients except the hominy, so I substituted frozen corn, and that was just fine.  We put corn chips in the bottom of the bowl before adding the posole.  Excellent!

This was amazing with only a few changes! I used center cut pork chops (2lbs cubed) instead of turkey. Chicken stock instead of turkey (I didn't have any). I threw in 2 cups of frozen corn, 1 can of tomato sauce and slow cooked all of it on low for 5 hrs. To date this has been the only recipe with hominy my husband will every eat! AMAZING! Thank you for this recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it's great!  Maybe not quite like "authentic" posole, but still very good.  A nice change from the same old "turkey bone soup".  Also, it's not as spicy as you might imagine using the fresh poblanos and canned green chilies.  Just a nice hint of spice.  This one's a keeper!

I made this for New Year's Day and everyone loved it. I used dry hominy and soaked and cooked it (the package had directions) and did not use cannellini beans; also roasted my poblanos.  It was really delicious.

I have made this recipe every year for close to a decade, always the day after Thanksgiving and my family loves it.  I use the turkey carcass from the Thanksgiving Dinner to make my turkey stock, which takes several hours.  And then I make the soup so it is a 4 hour labor of love.  The house smells so fantastic, while it is cooking and that is generally the day we also put up our Christmas tree.  This Posole is very much a part of our Holiday Traditions

I thought this was real close to the Posole everyone in New Mexico calls "real Posole".  One reviewer said it wasn't even close but I totally disagree! No meat, as she claimed, wouldn't be Posole at all!  Yet another review said beans and hominy together didn't work. Wow, I can't imagine it any other way. Many folks out my way use pinto rather than cannellini beans and it's great that way too. This recipe is what us south westerners call mex-American authentic!

Great receipe.  It came out very spicy hot. Don't know if my chiles were extra hot, but is a good receipe.  It's one that I will keep.

Ay caramba!  Me gusta mucho!  Left out the beans, pureed some of the hominy and threw in some tortilla chips which fall apart to give it a thicker consistency.  Seasoning is right on.  I'm sure I will make this often.

I took liberty with this recipe and changed up a few things but I thought I stuck to the spirit of this recipe nevertheless. I cooked the entire thing in a slow cooker, roasted the poblano, used 2 cans of green chiles as we love spicy food, and omitted the beans - didn't like it. Finally, I seasoned the whole thing according to taste with a combination of ground chile, chile de arbol, mexican oregano, salt and cumin. Yummy yummy and a fantastic way to use up those leftover turkey! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

My skeptical-of-new-recipes husband went crazy over this (he will eat anything with cumin in it).  I had made the Slow Cooker Turkey Breast recipe with a 7-pounder to make the Leftover Turkey Cheesecake recipe and had so much left over, that I had to find something to do with it. This was PERFECT with it. So good. There was only one brand of turkey broth at the store but I was just happy they had any.  When I can't find turkey broth - have had good results with turkey stock.  Might take 2 days to make this next time - slow cook the turkey breast and shred, then take the bones and everything needed to make a proper broth and slow cook that.  The onions and peppers disintegrated, I think the only thing I would do differently is to take that out and add that back in at the end.  Also had leftover bread and made some croutons (Garlic Crouton recipe) which was AWESOME with this.  The skeptical-hubby was nervous again but now says they are 'key' to this soup.  Another phrase out of his mouth 'instant classic' and 'part of the rotation' ;)

I don't know if it taste authentic or not but it was a wonderful change of pace from our regular turkey leftovers!!  It was flavorful and easy to make.  I used corn instead of the hominy but it still came out delicious.  I will use this recipes again for sure...simple wonderful !!!

My family loved this dish! I did omit the poblano peppers, due to my kids not liking spicy dishes. I did use fresh roasted green chiles though. I was telling a friend about making this dish, and she said hominy purchased from a mexican store is so much better(frozen hominy). Next time I make this, I plan to use her suggestion. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe was very good.   My husband and I were looking for something to do with leftover turkey.   This definitely fit the bill.   I know it is not your traditional posole but the flavor was fantastic!!!  This is a definite make again.

This was delicious and the perfect thing to do with leftover Thanksgiving turkey!  The seasoning was great and really the only thing that I did any differently was put in fresh jalapenos, and roasted some 2 poblano peppers on the grill and diced those up instead of using canned green chilis.  I'll definitely keep this recipe around for future use!!  Yum!

I don't know about the authenticity of this recipe, which some reviewers were apt to comment on, but this soup was outstanding!
It was very easy to make, provided all ingredients were on hand, like cooked turkey and turkey broth.  It is the perfect thing to make from the leftovers of a turkey dinner, if you don't use the broth for gravy.  I used romano and kidney beans, and whole kernel frozen corn, and it came out great.

We don't eat pork, so I loved finding a recipe for red posole that uses turkey (or chicken) instead!  Green posole is okay, but the flavor doesn't have the depth of the red.  Anyhow....I didn't have any turkey left-overs, so I used dark chicken instead, and jalapenos instead of poblanos.  The store didn't have any cannellini beans, so I used pinto.  The dark meat was fall apart tender, and we used lots of fresh lime and cabbage mixed in.  Great texture, and the flavor is awesome!

This was great, quite spicy as well.  My family doesn't really like beans so I left those out and it didn't seem to be missing anything.  I also provided the topping as suggested but I happened to have a bag of preshredded coleslaw mix (no dressing) and we used that in place of the shredded cabbage, the extra carrot in it didn't cause a problem at all.  Also because of the spicyness we had sour cream with it as well.

We have made this 2 times and both times we have loved it. This last time we didnt have turkey, so we used chicken. STILL GREAT! It works really well with lime juice, chopped onions, and crumbled tortilla chips thrown on top. LOVE THIS.

We loved this dish!  Yummy, versatile, and healthy!  It makes sort of a soup but my husband isn't a soup person so for the first meal we had it I drained the liquid and we had it with some corn tortillas and salsa.  Then there was more liquid so I had it for the next few days as soup for lunch. Also I didn't have hominy do I used frozen corn and that worked fine.  This would be great for a crowd!  This is one for the recipe box!

I thought this was great. I had never had posole before and didn't know what it was, but this was a great way to use turkey that i had bought and didn't know what to do with it. This recipe is a keeper!

We used this for thanksgiving left overs as well as Christmas left overs instead of just turkey soup.  I've never had Poole, but we are no wimps when it comes to Mexican food or spice in general.  So, I mad the soup just as listed with some extra garlic.  I used half dark meat, half white meat.  It turned out great and in my opinion wasn't spicy, just really flavorful.  We even gave our 7 year old daughter the soup and she liked it.  Oh and we garnished it with cheddar cheese, cilantro and tortilla chips.  Lime juice probably would be good too.  I have no idea how authentic this is, but it tastes great and frankly that's what I really care about.  :-)

This recipe was very easy and yummy.  I have used leftover turkey in soups before and never really liked the results.  This was delish.  I only used one can each of the hominy and beans and it turned out great.  Definitely a keeper for leftovers.

Just made this for the second time in a week.  Outstanding!  Didn't have any poblanos so doubled the diced green chillis - one can hot and one can mild. Served with cilantro, sour cream, cheddar and avocado. Tastes even better the 2nd and 3rd days.

I was looking for a dish that used leftover turkey and found this fantastic recipe.   I Followed the recipe, as is, and it was awesome!  I don't know if it is authentic or not but my family loved it.  I think I will be making turkey more often next year.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This was really good.  I would have rated it a TEN.  Only changed one item.  Used chili and lime powder because that was all I had.  Sprinkled with monterey jack cheese, sliced cabbage and fresh lime.

This was an excellent recipe. I used turkey stock instead of broth. What a great way to used the leftovers from Thanksgiving. Any time I make a turkey I will always make this after. Thank you.

Perfect use for left-over turkey from thanksgiving (I froze it and am just now getting to it).  Very savory and the perfect comfort food for a cool evening.  My New Mexican husband says this isn't like the Pasole he used to get as a kid, but it was very delicious none-the-less.

I have made the pork version of this, so it was great to see turkey.  I like both of them.  This just has a good, spicy flavor that even my 4 children liked.    Not too spicy--just enough to give a little heat!  I didn't have poblano chiles so I had to sub Jalapenos.  I'll try the right kind next time!

Fabulous! I used one hungarian pepper and one more mild pale green pepper and it was just the right amount of spicy (although people who don't like spicy foods might find it overly so).

WOW!  What a wonderful soup!  So easy to make and absolutely fabulous!  I made as written with the exception of the poblanos. I didn't have any, so used 4 or 5 canned chipotles instead.  Did I mention this recipe is fabulous!  Thanks so much for sharing, Camilla!

This is not traditional posole (we spell it differently in our area of New Mexico) but it’s a great base and a wonderful way to use turkey leftovers. I add much more NM green Chile’s, garlic, potatoes, and big squeeze of lime. But using just the way the recipe is written is delicious too.

Delicious!! My husband loved it! I will definitely make it again. flavorful and light  - nothing heavy - uses up leftovers. I used leftovers from a roast chicken along with stock I had made from the chicken. Didn't have the can of green chiles, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Used ancho powder for the chili powder. Don't know if that's exactly what they meant but it was soooo good!

It also did not take much time to put together. It's a great weeknight dinner. This is a keeper!

Delicious and easy!  Used the stock made from our Thanksgiving turkey and made it very spicy (used 4oz can diced jalapeños instead of mild chilis and added 4 fresh diced habaneros). Served over shredded cabbage w lime juice n cilantro. Winner!

Made this with leftover fresh turkey meat, dark and white mixed.  Added celery and a few chopped fresh green beans for crunch.  The store I went to did not have pablamo peppers so I used one red bell pepper.  We topped it with shredded red cabbage, cilantro, tortilla chips crushed up, and grated Mexican blend cheese.  Yummmmmm.

The only change I made to this recipe was substituting corn for the hominy (my kids don't like the texture of hominy). It is delicious! I highly recommend serving it with fresh lime, avocado, jalapeños, hot sauce, and some cheese (for you cheese lovers). I made my own broth with the carcass from our turkey yesterday. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because without the dressings, it was lacking a little something to me. I will definitely make this again! It is a good change from the normal turkey noodle soup I have been making with holiday leftovers.

I don't know how authentic it is but this recipe is yummy.  I used ground turkey and some chorizo in place of the left over turkey:) The only addition I did was a can of Rotel for a little more kick.  My family loved it.

Hubby loves this and requests when we have leftover turkey. Variations: added one lb cooked chorizo, omitted beans, replaced can chiles with one small dice jalapeño, thickened with cornmeal. Presto! It is now chile!

,I was very disappointed in this soup. It didn't have the flavor I thought the ingredients would give it. This was way too bland for our tastes, so I added a can of extra hot Rotel Tomatoes, a can of whole kernel corn and some jalapeños. All that made it thicker and spicier and tastier.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe.  I shared it with others and only got rave reviews.  I did, however, alter the recipe based on what was in the cupboard.  I substituted pinto beans for the white beans and corn for the hominy.  The taste of the soup reminded me of Chevy's tortilla soup, which I like.

This was easy and  a tasty way to use up those turkey leftovers, especially on a chilly night.  We like some extra pop so we 1 tbsp chipotle chili powder and 1 tbsp regular chili powder.  Enjoy!!

terrific, Pozoloe is one of my favorites and this is a good recipe - I add a little chopped cilantro along with the cabbage at the end. But the suggestion of having onions, etc that people can add to their own sounds like a better idea....next time!
