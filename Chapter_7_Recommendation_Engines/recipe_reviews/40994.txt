I made this fabulous recipe as an appetizer for our Thanksgiving meal.  It was a huge hit, and everyone was asking for the recipe.  The cheese and  apricots complemented each other wonderfully.  This easy recipe made me look like quite the little hostess!

This was tasty and different.  Definitely not good at room temperature.  This needs to be served right out of the oven so not great to bring somewhere or for an 'appetizer party' where your guests are sampling.

These were really tasty, fairly easy to make, and look so elegant! The combination of flavors works very well and quite different from the usual and now boring appetizers. However, probably not the best thing to take somewhere, would be best served right out of the oven as suggested.

Amazingly simple and wonderful.  The mixture of flavors works well and they are so easy to make!  I've made these twice and both times gotten comments about how wonderful and original they taste!

This was great though I burned a majority of the bread. Next time I will put it on a low heat instead of what was recommended. Used dried rosemary. This was fabulous and plan on serving it tomorrow night at a wine tasting I am hosting. It was the perfect complement to my glass of California merlot.

This is a unique, simple and fabulous appetizer that will make your guests beg for the recipe.  It must be served out of the oven, so if you do the full amount for 20 servings, bake half, serve, then bake the other half when the guests are ready.  Delicious!

I was pleasantly suprised with this appetizer and received several compliments.  My hubby is not crazy about anything "sweet" tasting in his food so he passed on this but I really enjoyed it.  I used slivered almonds (not toasted) and about a 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic rather than the cloves.  I also used dried crushed rosemary instead of the fresh.  This was one of the any appetizers we enjoyed on our Valentine's Day cook-out and there weren't very many left over at the end of the evening.  Good recipe.

Yep - this is great - delicious.  Love the rosemary and garlic together.  Plus there's nothing better than melted brie!  The combination of apricot and brie is classic and lovely - I make baked brie often with apricot preserves for special occasions.

Made this for a party and got a lot of "oohs" and "ahhs".  They were gone in no time.
