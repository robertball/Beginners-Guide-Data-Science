10.5.16  The potatoes have a nice little kick from the red curry paste.  I added a bit more lime juice and a few red pepper flakes to the sauce, which was a nice partner to the lettuce cups.  The Thai red curry paste and olive oil produced great potatoes, and I can even see them (cut in larger chunks) as a good side dish to an entree.  Nice lunch today, enjoyed!
