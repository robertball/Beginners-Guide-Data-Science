This cake was so much fun!  I made it for my husband's birthday, so I added
a can of frosting to it before I decorated it.  I used fat free yogurt instead of
the sour cream.  I also used chocolate chips instead of the peanut butter ones.
It turned out really well.  I found a candy that you can form into any shape, so
I made shrimp, cherry tomatoes, and green pepper wedges.  It was really 
cute!  Thanks for the great idea!

I made this for Father's Day and it was a huge hit. The burgers were delicious. I added some yellow fondant "cheese" on top and two fondant hot dogs with grill marks. Surprisingly easy.
