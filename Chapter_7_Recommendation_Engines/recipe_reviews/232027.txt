My banana wasn't frozen, so I added some extra ice to reach the correct smoothie consistency.  Cinco de Mayo is this weekend, and mangos are available everywhere.  My mango was perfectly ripe and juicy and added incredible flavor to this drink.  The tiny carrot pieces make the smoothie look pretty, and although not overpowering, the ginger is the surprise ingredient that will leave people wondering "...what is that?"  I make a lot of smoothies, there's nothing about this that I didn't like, and it definitely will be made again.  And as if that isn't enough, nutritionally, this breaks down well.  Nice recipe Ecco_Star.

This was a good smoothie! 2 things I liked about it, is that it incorporated a vegetable and that it was the first smoothie/juice with ginger that called for the powdered form. I find fresh ginger too strong of a flavor in anything other than a stir-fry. I will subtitute it in other recipes. The type I used was Chinese Powdered #1 from Penzey's. Their spices are very strong, so I cut the amount in half. The yogurt I buy is non-fat Greek plain yogurt. I subtituted 1/3 cup of that for the 6oz of vanilla kind. Next time, maybe I will add a little vanilla or sweetener to see if there is any difference. My mango was frozen and I still used the ice cubes. Even with a frozen mango, not sure how someone without a high-speed blender could blend this though. It has very little liquid. I have a Vitamix blender and had to use 1/2 cup fresh oj, instead of a 1/4 cup, and really had to use the tamper to process it. Mine was also orange in color for some reason. ty

I substituted whole milk for the orange juice in this and it was still waaaay too sugary for my tastes.  I would make it again, maybe with coconut milk and honey, and no yogurt or orange juice.

This deserves 5++!!  I reversed the frozen fruit cuz had mango frozen already and used fresh banana.  Followed all else as directed and it is so refreshing and tasty-very thick and smooth!  Would also be great to put into a popsicle mold to freeze for hot summers; whatever way we will be making this often.  Thanks for this post, Ecco_Star, but it's greeeeeaaaaat, lol

Delicious.  My banana wasn't frozen but that didn't matter.  Accidentally used 2 tsp. of ginger, made it a little snappy, but I liked it and thought it tasted great.  No carrots on hand, but I'm sure they would have been great, too.

Added a few more carrots and used 1/2 vanilla yogurt and 1/2 plain Greek yogurt to reduce the sugar. Then added a little extra vanilla extract. Most of my fruit was frozen, so I didn't need to add much ice.  Used about 1/2 the ginger called for also. Excellent!

Mmmm, loved it!  I used french vanilla yogurt, and I think it added extra flavor! And I omitted carrots since I didn't have them.

I loved the zip the ginger added to the flavor.  If I hadn't put them in myself I doubt I would have known there were carrots in there.  I think you get a better fruit taste if a smoothie isn't too cold so I don't add ice, my banana, mango and juice were refrigerated.  For me, this is just perfect.  Thank you, Ecco Star.

omg, so good. Used one fresh banana one fresh mango (fist time i have never bought and used one) waited a day for the mango to be a bit soft. I washed and half peeled the mango. I added a wopping tablespoon of great value vanilla yogurt and, I dunno, a 1/4 cup dole orange peach mango juice. Also about a handful and a half of ice. I will always have these ingredients in my home from now on. Of course I am sipping on my smoothie as I type :D  I would have added the carrots, as I add them to almost all of my smoothies- my boyfriend said he might try if i made it with out them- oh well I will next time. and I didnt have any ginger.  yum yum yum
