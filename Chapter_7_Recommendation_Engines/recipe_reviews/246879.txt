I love any type of sausage and Mexican Chorizo is one of my favorites. I cooked the onions with the chorizo and I added dried ground habanero to give it a kick. I fried them a bit longer than called for because I like my potatoes extra crispy. Delicious!

I loved these.  Just had them for lunch.  I used Soyrizo instead of chorizo.   less greasy. I cooked mine for about 3 minutes per side

My wife and I love this recipe! We used some turkey chorizo and they turned out perfect.
