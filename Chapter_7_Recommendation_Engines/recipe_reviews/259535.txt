2.9.19  Iâ€™d recommend baking the crust a bit before adding the chocolate filling, because the crust crumbled coming out of the tart pan.  Be sure to bake them on a piece of foil because the butter from the crust leaked out the bottom of the tart pan.  The chocolate filling could have been a little creamier, so I will try increasing the amount of whipping cream to 1-1/2 tablespoons next time.   Super easy to make, but the presentation was not as nice as it could be, however, I think   that can be improved by making the changes I mentioned above.  But most importantly, it tasted good!
