I was looking for a recipe for "old fashioned" creamy cucumbers like my Mom used to make. This was the closest I could find. I didn't use ranch. My Mom never did. I also used buttermilk and added 1/2 cup of vinegar and addded 2 tablespoons of sugar. From what I remembered from the way my Mom made them. I basically just needed the amounts. I also used light sour cream and light miracle whip. They did end up tasting just like Mom's.

I didn't use fat free sour cream and used miracle whip instead of mayo.  It was a big hit with my family and will surely be making it again and again.

This was ok. I think the reason it seems bland, like the other reviewer mentioned, is that traditionally (here in the south), we tend to expect a vinegar type flavor from our cucumber salad, and this didn't have that zing to it.

Too bland .. maybe some added vinegar would give this some flavor and the zing that it's missing!

This was Hubs' contribution to our dinner tonight and while he enjoyed making it, he felt he could have easily come up with something tastier had he been left to his own devices.  He used Penzey's Buttermilk Ranch Seasoning, less onion, and made the good judgment call not to peel the cucumber. We ate this, but it really didn't trip our trigger.  I particularly didn't care for the celery seed, which I felt was much too evident.

This was the closest thing I could find to my grandma's cucumber salad. She never added the milk or ranch dressing though. I didn't peel my cucumbers and wish now that I had. Overall, a good recipe.

A good quick salad for all of those garden cucumbers! I liked using the low-fat ingredients! I may cut the milk by half next time, but was still good as is! I did not have any fresh dill, so I used 2 tsp. of dried dill. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used two tbsp. of Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix and only used 1 tsp. of dill. I didn't need the whole cup of milk, I just added a little at a time until it was the consistancy I wanted. My whole family liked this and I especially liked that it was a cucumber salad without sugar. If you can, use a homemade ranch dressing mix. It makes all the difference in flavor and without all the salt.

Wonderful blend of the dairy products!  I used dried dill in place of fresh and it worked great.

So so easy and very yummy! I left out the onions because other than myself, nobody cares for them. Everyone loved this dish! Thanks for sharing.
