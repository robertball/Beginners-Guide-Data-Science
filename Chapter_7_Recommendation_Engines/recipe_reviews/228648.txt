Whole almonds in the food processor with dates and some coconut make a better crust…don't grind the almonds down too fine…press into cupcake liners and put in fridge or freezer until firm…much better than baking.  For filling, some liquid stevia can be added for a sweeter tart.

This recipe certainly has promise of being good.  I made these tarts for my son, who is on the paleo diet.  I used Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour/Meal for the crust (his favorite part), and for the custard I used raw honey which I had to double to keep from being too tart.  He liked the crust better than the custard.  His family preferred the custard!  I thought it was perfect that this recipe makes a small amount--in keeping with the idea that someone on a diet doesn't want to incorporate large amounts of sweets.  There is probably something out there in the paleo world that could be added to these ingredients to make them a little more like sugar-induced lemon tarts, so I'll have to do a little searching.

I made the filling and it never thickened up. I also had to add a considerable amount more sweetener on top of adding cornstarch. Then, I made the crust and it was very thick and didn't really have any flavor. I think most desserts are over sweet, but I would have even added an additional sweetener on top of a pinch of salt to the crust.

Our family likes these. My 9 year old chose and made it all on her own. Very easy. It's now her specialty for a healthier family dessert. We do now skip the honey and instead add 2 Splenda pkgs to the filling after it has thickened. She has also added a fresh raspberry on top of each. Yum. Btw I never remember to buy paper muffin cups so each time she just sprays the muffin tin with Pam or dusts them with almond meal. Never had any problems with sticking.

Wow, these are tart!  I don't mind wincing a bit when eating a lemon tart, so they were OK.  However, I think I could have cut back on the lemon rind just to reign it in a little bit.  I added a little agave to balance things out.  As for the crust - I read that clarified butter is cleared on the paleo list, so I did substitute 1 tablespoon for one of the tablespoons of lemon juice to avoid it being too tough.  Turns out, it's lovely!  I'll keep experimenting with the filling - it's almost there!  Thanks for posting :)

This is worth experimenting with.  The tart shells were dense and a bit rubbery, though tender and tasted ok.  The batter tasted awesome prior to baking.  I might mess with the ingredients a bit to get it to bake up better.  The lemon curd was good, though very tart even after adding extra honey, but I didn't mind since I like tart tarts :). I ran fresh peeled lemons through my juicer, which would be tarter than bottled juice.  I used regular sized muffin cups, and could have gotten 5 tarts out of it, more if you made them shallower, which I think would be a good idea.  A little of the filling goes a long way!  Oh, and I didn't have paper cups, so I very lightly greased nonstick tins, which worked just fine.  Overall, the filling is very good, but the shells are ok at best.  It was quick and easy to put together.

It was a little too tart. Next time, I'll add another tablespoon of honey.  Other than that, it was very good.  I especially liked the almond/date crust

The crust can be made for many recipes.  I tripled crust recipe and filled leftover pastry cups with almond ice cream.

I wasn't fond of the almond meal, but that is what I looked up the recipe for, so I could use mine up. I added a 1/4 cup gluten free flower and a teaspoon of baking powder, and a 1/2 cup sugar to the crust. I also used a lot more honey (to taste) and a couple more eggs. I needed more than four for desert for company. Some of our family like it and some said it was ok. I did love the filling and will use it again but with pie crust dough.
