I use blsl chicken breasts and marinaded them for 24 hours. The only change I made was to add sliced onions to the marinade. This is easy to make and the lime flavor comes through well.

I made some changes to the original recipe and thought I would pass them along. I added 1cup of EVOO to help prevent the chicken from sticking to the grill. I also added the zest of 2 limes, making sure not to get any of the white part in. I added some minced garlic (about 2 cloves) and some chopped onions and reduced the pepper to 2 tsp (based off of some other reviews). Marinated for 2 hours and grilled AMAZING!

Holy Pepper!! The pepper overwhelmed my husband and I. I used 4 chicken breasts. I was wondering if 2 tablespoons is supposed to be 2 teaspoons. I will def make again with less pepper, I could taste the lime and cilantro flavoring and just know it would have been delicious if not over powered.

We made this with flat iron steak and it was delicious! We used the steak in tortillas with lettuce/tomato/cheese/sour cream for garnish. Next day we had it over rice with guacamole/lettuce/tomato. Then we used it up by making taco salads!

No offence but this is barely a recipe.  It's basically chicken with lime squirted on it.  I'm sure it's good, though.

1-23 18 ~I so enjoyed this, however, I made a few modifications to suit my personal taste.  Rather than a whole chicken and an outdoor grill (I hate dark meat), I chose to use boneless chicken breasts and a cast iron grill pan on the stove-top.  Because boneless, skinless chicken breasts are so lean, I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to the marinade to help keep the chicken from drying out as it cooked.  I forgot the garlic salt and didn’t miss it.  In fact, now that I look at the recipe again, the amounts indicated for both the garlic salt and the pepper seemed waaay overload so I’m glad I missed the garlic salt and used the pepper to taste.  The final result was just delicious, especially since I accompanied it with a tomato avocado salsa I made with the recipe Avocado Salad, also from this site.  Hubs is not a fan of either cilantro or avocado, so the fact he was out of town allowed me to make this and to enjoy what I probably would not have tried otherwise!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I just made 3 large breasts.   I marinated them for about 24 hours, and then grilled them.  I had a little leftover, and sliced it up for chicken nachos the next day.  It was excellent, and simple to prepare.  I will use this recipe again.

Instead of a whole chicken, I used chicken breasts.  I will make it again, and again, and again.  Great.

Absolutely delicious!!  Shredded leftovers for enchiladas, the most wonderful flavor!  I did reduce the pepper as suggested by others.

This dish was amazing.  I took the advice of other reviewers.  I deleted the garlic salt and replaced it with six fresh minced garlic cloves, I also added a sliced onion and about 1/2 of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).   I marinated for about 8 hours.  Everyone loved it, even my 7 year old who doesn't like cilantro. I will absolutely make it again. :)

The side dish I made was a quinoa corn salad, also very yum!

The chicken had great flavor. I used 2 chicken breasts and cut the ingredients in half. There definitely was an error in the garlic salt and pepper amounts. Two teaspoons was more like it instead of tablespoons. Other than that I did not change a thing. It is a keeper for me and so easy to put together.
grace, Indiana

I made it, and it was good.  I poked holes in the chicken to let the marinade in better.  I had it in the refrigerator for 6 hours and grilled it on my smoker.  It just didn't seem like the marinade made it into the chicken very well.  It was good, don't get me wrong.  I will try this again, but I will let it marinade over night.

This was a great recipe!  I made it with pork ribs instead of chicken and it turned out amazing.  I did feel like it was a little salty so I will probably add less garlic salt next time I make it, but other than that the flavor was fantastic!

So easy and delicious. Needed to use the cilantro from my garden. Made it with boneless skinless breasts, added a tiny bit of oil. Served on a warm evening with steamed baby potatoes and a green salad.

I tend to skip reviews where people completely change the recipe. However, I feel like some of these tips were helpful. We used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Added a splash of olive oil to prevent sticking to the grill. And changed the 2 tablespoons each of garlic salt and pepper to 2 teaspoons each (I just couldn’t bring myself add 2 tablespoons). Recipe was fantastic! All four of us loved it and agreed that it is definitely a make-again recipe. Absolutely no leftovers!

Me and my friend’s from school really liked this recipe. I marinaded it overnight, then grilled the chicken. To give it a little extra kick I poured the leftover marinade over it before I served it.

A simple, yet very flavorful chicken marinade.  Great as is, or sliced thin for fajitas or a chicken salad.

This was so easy and so delicious.  I'm not a big fan of grilled chicken.  It's usually too rubbery and flavorless, but this was juicy and very flavorful, even made with skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  I'd imagine it would be even better made with bone-in dark meat.

This is delicious. I followed the instructions for cooking it in the oven. It is delicate enough to add to tacos or even chicken salad. Thank you for the recipe.

I will DEFINITLY  make it again! 
I used minced garlic gloves instead of garlic salt to reduce the sodium.
We grilled it, then cut it up and put it in salad with black beans, corn, cilantro, lettuce, tomato, and a little cheese. It was excellent!

We thought this was quite tasty! The only difference I would make is to flatten the chicken a bit with a meat tenderizer for marinating. Without doing so the chicken doesn't get enough flavor. 

I was super skeptical about this recipe at first and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor.

I honestly did not think I would like this, was making it solely because I knew my husband would love it.  It was delicious! I marinated it for 24 hrs and was liberal with the amounts in the marinade, I added more olive oil and lime juice was out of the bottle rather than squeezed.  Great summer grilling recipe!

Added a few tablespoons of EVO. Marinated about an hour flipping occasionally. Delicious! Chicken was moist and flavorful. Adding to my go-to file.

Very simple and flavorful, I wish I had marinated it longer than three hours.  My husband gave it four stars but I thought it deserved five stars for flavor and ease.  I had intended to grill it but the rain caused me to fry them but it still came out great.

This was a very easy recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I added 6 minced garlic cloves instead of garlic salt which came to 1tbsp.  I also added 1.5tbsp of ground black pepper,  1 small jalepeno pepper, finely chopped. I then marinated it over night.   I had previously made this recipe to the instructions, it was too bland for us, but it was still good.  I just decided to spice it up a little.  It is a great recipe to start with and expand on!

We liked this very much. Because I was cooking only for two, I did not use a whole chicken but a large breast and adjusted amounts of other ingredients. This will be a summer "go to".

Surprised how flavorful this was for such a simple marinade.  Made a few changes based on what I had - used 8 bone in skin on chicken thighs and marinated for 3 hours in a ziplock bag.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes because it was raining, but will grill next time.  Might use a little less garlic salt next time, thought it was a tad bit salty, but other than that I thought it was pretty good.  Will make again.

Tasty!  Marinated for 4 hours.  Used chicken thighs in the oven.  Cooked in glass roasting pan at 350 deg.F for 45 minutes - turned chicken over last 10 minutes.  Used 5 limes instead of 4 & used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  
Easy      Will make again.
