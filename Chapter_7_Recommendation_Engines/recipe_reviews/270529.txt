Delicious!! Best thing to ever happen to bacon ?? I added a little Cajun seasoning to the ranch dipping sauce to spice it up.

These taste amazing. The flavors compliment each other perfectly. The only discrepancy I had was the amount of time cooking. Recipe called for 12-15 minutes, but it took me closer to 30 for the bacon to brown. Worth the wait!

I made this for my coffee club!  A hit and so simple!  

I would recommend precooking the bacon a bit if you want it well done...

This is quickly becoming a party favourite!

As messy as they were (probably my fault for not using toothpicks), my family loved these!  Easy to fix and they were great with ranch dressing.

Following the recipe the bacon was not cooked enough for my tastes. Next time I will pre-cook the bacon a little in a skillet (or microwave) so that it gets done properly.

Yeah, this was really good. In fact we're planning on making more this weekend. It's an odd combo for sure (and quite salty), but really tasty.

Super simple to make. Delicious, savory, but a little messy. Husband and the kids loved them.
