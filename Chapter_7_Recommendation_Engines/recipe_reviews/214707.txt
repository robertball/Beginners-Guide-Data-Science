While this was not completely inedible, I will not make this again.  Sorry, but the flavor just seemed a little "off".  Perhaps we are not fans of fish sauce (never had it before now), which I felt smelled odd and probably contributed to our dislike of the marinade.  If you enjoy fish sauce you may like this recipe.  I did make a change and decrease the salt; I put in less than half the recommended amount, based on another review I read that said this was too salty.

I followed this recipe exactly, which was fairly time consuming.  The result was MUCH too salty.  I had to scrape the seasoning off in order to be able to eat it.  You couldn't even taste the peanuts.  The steak itself was very moist and flavorful (I am assuming from the marinade...).  Not sure if I did something wrong, but I cannot imagine anyone liking their meat so salty : (
