These turned out good, the only thing I did not put in was the poppy seeds. These have a nice onion flavor and were easy to make. I just drop the biscuits onto the 
pan, instead of having to roll out the dough then cut the biscuits.

These looked good and browned very nicely, but I did not like the texture or taste. They basically have no taste and are a bit dry.

These were easy to make and very tasty. I wasn't a fan of the texture 100% but they do the job.

These biscuits are delicious and so easy to make! Mine didn't stay in a ball form though. Kinda flat but other than that they're great. I'd def make these again!

They were delicious.  Have been a family favorite for years.   Lost the recipe some time ago.  Searched and followed recipes online.  This was the best of all.
