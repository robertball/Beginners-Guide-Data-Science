Quick, easy and very good. I used wheat germ instead of oat bran and OJ instead of concentrate.  I added a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon.

I increased this recipe to make three servings--enough for my two sons and I. I increased the banana and also added more raisins and used one large apple. I did not add the salt.  We liked this. Very filling and comforting. We topped our bowls of oatmeal with milk and brown sugar. GREAT way to get extra fiber and fruit into little ones.

I think the orange juice made the oatmeal taste off, kind of sour. I will definitely try this healthy version again without the OJ. I love the fact that the fruit sweetened the oatmeal without adding additional sweetener! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe tastes great, and it is very quick and easy to put together. I used a cup of vanilla rice milk instead of the water, the fresh-squeezed juice of one orange instead of the concentrate, one whole banana, one whole small apple, and extra cinnamon with a dash of nutmeg. The banana disappeared by the time it finished cooking, so I will probably slice another banana to serve on top at the end next time. I had never eaten oat bran before, and I honestly thought it was a little strange at first, but after a few bites I didn't notice anymore. I enjoyed this, and I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was great.  It only takes 5 minutes to make and it's very healthy.  The brown sugar isn't necessary because the fruit sweetens it naturally (I dumped some on the first time I made it and it was way too sweet).  I do use a little extra cinnamon, golden raisins, I top it with more banana, and I like to use steel cut oats if I have a batch already made up.  Thanks for a tasty and healthy breakfast!

This recipe is extremely filling. Mine turned out very thick, which is not normally how I prefer my oatmeal. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I tried it with and without brown sugar, and it is definitely better without it. The banana and orange juice provide plenty of sweetness. Although I enjoyed this recipe, I probably won't make it very often because I've tried better. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't like this but my husband kind of did (he ate it, anyway).  I may try again but using regular rolled oats and milk instead of quick-cooking oats and water.
