getting ready to eat it but so far the meat is delicious. I just wanted to add that the meat reached 170 degrees in 4 hours on low. So I went ahead and rested the meat like the recipe says, and shredded. and kept on warm until dinnertime. I have only tasted the meat, but like I said, I think this will be a good keeper! I rated only 4 stars because I haven't actually tried it as a taco yet.

Following the recipe exactly, I found the meat rather tasteless. It definitely needed salt. The chuck roast didn't shred very well but that could just be the kind I got. This recipe wasn't horrible, but it didn't make it into my recipe box!

This is so flavorful and so easy!  We use it in hard shell taco's, and also make burritos out of it.  VERY yummy!!!!!

Just had this tonight.  I added a little more cumin and chili powder.  It was delish.  My father and I loved it.  No more ground beef for us.  Highly recommend it.

Easy and the kids ate them.  I served with diced onions, shredded ranchero cheese and soft corn tortillas (heated).  Everyone added onions, etc. to their taste.  Two pounds made about 9 tacos - next time I'll buy a bigger chuck roast (family of 5).

These tacos are so bland, no amount of jalepenos and salsa can redeem them. This recipe needs serious modifications.

I have only given 4 stars as I didnt follow the recipe exactly as I didnt have some of the ingredients but what I did make we all enjoyed and I think that the orig. would probably be very nice.
I used tomato soup instead of the french onion and I used a full packet of taco seasoning instead of any other seasoning. Half way through the cooking I added a large tin of sweetcorn and some more water. Served with stir fried veg, boiled rice and soft tacos

This was very good.  I'm not sure why taco seasoning wasn't included so I added 1/2 cup.  I definitely prefer this meat as opposed to hamburger or chicken.

I made this for about 20 people at a family members birthday party!  It turned out great.  I added a packet of taco mix after I shredded the beef.  Just for alittle more meixcan taste.

My whole family loved this recipe!  I used 1/4 packet of taco seasoning instead of the seasoning recommended.  The meat shredded and was tender.  I will definately make this again.

It tasted good, but it was too watered down.  Made it too difficult to eat the meat as tacos.
