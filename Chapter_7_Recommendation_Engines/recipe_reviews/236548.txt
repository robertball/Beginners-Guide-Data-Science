I've tried a number of slow cooker oatmeal recipes from this site, and hands down, this is the best.  We don't particularly care for steel-cut oats, so I used regular oatmeal.  I checked the cooker at 3 hours, it was done, and starting to stick a little on the bottom.  It well may be that my slow cooker's "low" setting is hotter than many, and maybe not using steel-cut oats had something to do with it, but I would not let this cook overnight.  I don't mean that comment to sound negative, but I would suggest using some caution on cooking time.  For our tastes, it also was too sweet, so I'll try cutting the brown sugar in half in the future.  This is really a tasty recipe, and I have some containers going into the freezer to be enjoyed later by reheating in the microwave.

1. This was very quick and easy to throw together. I had some reservations, but decided to follow the recipe (as close as I possibly could) for the first try. And I will not be making any changes!
2. I was concerned that the 4 c. milk (I used whole milk because no almond milk on hand) would not be enough for the 2 C. oats but the consistency turned out perfect and I will NOT change that ratio in the future
3. This milk:oats ratio yielded a very thick, slightly chewy oatmeal. Exactly the way steel cut oats should be served, IMHO.
4. I used 1 smallish granny smith apple and 1 large braburn apple, peeled, cored, and sliced.
5. I toasted my walnuts – as always
6. I used the full ½ c. brown sugar and was satisfied, although I typically like it a bit sweeter, but you can always add more on top afterwards.
7. Thank GOODNESS I used a crock pot liner – I started this at 10 pm and turned it off at 6:30 – it was done, stuck to the sides, and needed stirring, but it was not burnt.
8. Even if I had raisins on hand, I would not have added them before cooking – they turn out mushy and should instead be added as a garnish.
THANK you for the recipe!! This will be written in to my permanent recipe book!!

Overcooked in my crock pot, but I expected that.  It has issues.  Made without the nuts because I don't like them.  Next time will use a programmable crock pot, and will get rid of this demon possessed one.  :D

I made this recipe just in a pot in the morning. I cooked it on very low, stirring often. It took about 30 - 45 minutes to cook. It depends on how chewy you like the steel cut oats.
I didn't add the raisins until the oats were finished cooking.
It turned out perfect!
Thanks for the recipe, Ann. I will definitely be making it again.

I love this recipe! I add 1/2 cup cut up cranberries and about a teaspoon of vanilla. It always turns out awesome!

I made this exactly as it was written, except without walnuts.  Other then the cooking time being too long it was great.  I cut the cooking time to 5-6 hours on Low (eventually put in on warm).  A crock pot liner is a must-have for this recipe.  It still stuck to the sides of the liner--but that is due to the crock pot--not the recipe.

For the most part this is a good recipe. I had never heard of baked oatmeal before. I stayed with the recipe but it still came out a little gelled. Definitely need to add some water or milk to it. If you can set your cooker by the hour I suggest doing that. Mine didn't burn the sides too bad as others have said. Overall pretty good for my first time trying it!

I followed this recipe very closely, except by cutting down the sugar. The oatmeal burned badly all around the edges of the slow cooker ! It was too thick too. I removed the burned  ring of oatmeal and added some warm milk to thin it out. I don't think I would be making this again because I don't know what I can do to prevent the burning from happening ?!

I used our really very cooker on warm overnight. I used cinnamon applesauce rather than apples.

This was the first time that I had made this recipe and I won't be making it again. It came out to being a half a crock pot of mostly mushy raisins.
