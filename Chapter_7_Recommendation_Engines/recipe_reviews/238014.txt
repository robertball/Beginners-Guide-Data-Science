I may be biased but Karyn (Meme) is my mother and this is her recipe. She was a fantastic cook and I grew up on this and other wonderful kitchen creations of hers. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for those of you who gave her high ratings on this recipe! She was so flattered by them and was so excited when this one was published online! Thank you again!

I used Spicy V8®, and it definitely ramped up the flavor without being too spicy or overpowering the other ingredients.  And I will always use that when making this recipe, too!   I'll admit that this is the first time I've eaten pasta fagioli, and I have no idea what Olive Garden®'s version tastes like, but I loved all of the bold and rich layers of flavor in this recipe.   Thanks, Karen Osborne, for this tasty soup, we thoroughly enjoyed it!

Wonderful soup and even though I changed a couple things it didn't change the base recipe, which is definitely worth this 5 star rating. I did use Spicy V8 as suggested by others plus I added one extra can of cannelloni beans but the biggest change (which again didn't alter the base recipe) was I omitted the ground beef and chunked up some polish sausage that I needed to use up and I used three cheese tortellini I also needed to use up in place of the pasta. I sautéed the sausage and veggies (no added olive oil needed), dumped all but the tortellini in the crockpot on low for 6 hours, added chunked zucchini the last hour, cooked up the tortellini and stirred it all together and served with Parmesan cheese. Can you spell R-A-V-E reviews??? This definitely replaces my other Pasta Fagioli soup recipe!

Just delicious, we loved it. Great flavor.  I used low sodium V8, so it did need salt when it was done. I also included more carrots and celery than the recipe, only because that what I normally do (try to get as many vegetables my diet as possible)  I'm sure it tastes even better the next day, but it didn't last that long around our house.  Next time I will make a double batch so there are leftovers. Will make this over and over again.

First time making this type of soup, and It turned out pretty good. My husband loved it. I only had tomato juice, but still turned out with an extra cup of chicken broth.

Delicious with minimal effort. I did NOT  taste V-8 at all, just a wonderful full flavor. Great recipe and added to my recipes! Thanks! *** Have made this several times, with this last time using ground turkey. Also very good. **March, 2018 Just an update - this is perhaps one of 3 of the very best recipes on this site.  Thanks again!

This is my first time eating Pasta Fagioli and this one is very good, even in the summertime.  I put it in the crockpot and let it Simmer all night then added a can of diced Italian-seasoned tomatoes to "beef" it up because I only used the recommended amount of vegetables.  I bet this will be really good when it's cold outside too.  Keeping the noodles separate is brilliant and I will use that idea with other recipes.  Thanks so much Karyn for submitting your recipe.

Love this soup
I just made it for the third time. This is a recipe I will continue to enjoy. I used orzo instead of the pasta in the recipe
, because I always have it on hand. It tastes a lot like the Olive Garden soup. I definitely recommend you try it

Loved this soup. I substituted tri-colored veggie pasta (had on hand), low sodium vegetable juice and a pound of ground sweet Italian chicken sausage (needed to cook it). Soup was even better the next day. Definitely will make again and again.

Made this and served it the next day as suggested so flavours could blend. Family really enjoyed it and was a great dinner on a busy weeknight with a side salad and fresh bread. I did add more celery and carrots because my family likes the extra veggies, as well as a bay leaf to add a bit more depth of flavour to the broth. I mixed everything together in one pot (added dried pasta during last 6-8 minutes of soup simmering), making it much easier to serve and it tasted great. Will make again and will try adding a pkg. of baby spinach.

I am giving this 5 stars because it tasted amazing but I did change a few things. I substituted tomato juice for V8 because that's what I had. And sprinkled parmigiana cheese in our bowls to taste. My son is extremely picky and ate this right up!

Used ground turkey instead of beef and doubled the carrots and celery.  The V8 really makes it.  Definitely keep the pasta separate or the next day you will have no broth!

I can't wait to dig in! Made it for dinner with my left over roast n some fresh lean hamburger.  I actually had cooked the hamburger and drain it and send it off to the side and followed the directions from there . as I was starting adding my vegetable juice and my chicken broth I had rinsed the Canelli beans I threw them in a pot only did I realize towards the end that I was supposed to add last but they've been in the soup . Also  at this point I added my leftover roast that I had diced and my hamburger into the mixture . I will cook the noodles to put the soup over once hubby gets home but it does clearly remind me of Olive Gardens soup it's not just a vegetable soup it's very good. Going to serve it with sourdough grilled cheese sandwiches and I know my hubby is going to love it

The V8 juice was overpowering. It was gross. This would probably be so much better with regular canned tomatoes and/or sauce.

Everyone in the family loved it!   Will definitely make again and again!  I used the low sodium V8, next time I will try the spicy version since we love spicy foods.  I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. The soup has wonderful flavor.

This was very good.  I made 3 changes to this soup; used spicy V-8 juice as other's suggested,  garbanzo beans instead of cannellini beans and whole wheat pasta.  I cooked it on the stove for longer to slowly develop the flavors.  I purposely made this a day ahead of when I planned to eat it...this type of soup only gets better over the next few days.

This was great!  My boys loved it and it was fairly easy  to make.  I tossed the meat in right away and used Italian seasoning mix instead of the individual dried herbs.  Other than that, followed the recipe. I served it with a side of  garlic rye bread.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I used more carrots and celery, and I added some zucchini -- just because I never seem to eat enough veggies. I also used ground turkey. I used two cans of beans and left out the pasta. I know it seems like I changed a lot, but I don't think I changed the foundation. And the foundation is delicious!

01/2016:  I liked it.  Used ground turkey.  Doubled the carrots and celery.  V8 was a 46 oz bottle-used it all.  Cut chicken broth to 8oz.  Used Navy beans instead of cannellini .  Couldn't find ditalini pasta so I used brown rice penne pasta.  Seasoned meat with Tony's and Italian seasoning.  Added 1/2 t salt, 1/8 t cayenne, 1 can corn and 1 can tomatoes and a zucchini.  Put in the crock pot.  Sprinkled with parmesan.  Would be good with cheese tortellini next time.

So this is one of the new recipes I thought I would try out and while I have to say I have never eaten Pasta Fagioli before even though I love and am a big Italian food fan so I have nothing to compare it to. Having said that, I will say it was very good. Husband liked it as well. Easy and economical to prepare, it is enough for 5 adults. We had it with crusty French Bread and it was perfect.

This was exactly what I have been looking for!  I will definitely be making this again.  It is perfect the way it is.  I use a heavy hand with the pepper, so it had a little zip.  Yum!

I followed the recipe except that I used spicy V8 as suggested by another, added more garlic and carrots (julienned the carrots instead of diced), I added an additional can of red kidney beans with the white beans and I simmered the soup longer with a bay leaf. I needed a bit more V8 than the recipe called for because of the added beans and carrots. Amazing! Even better than Olive Garden's version! Thank you for the recipe!

I added about twice the carrots, celery and garlic, along with about 1/2 can of garbonzo beans I had in the fridge.  I also added additional broth to cut the tomato a bit.  This was rated 5 star by all my family and has been requested I make it again, as well as requesting copies of the recipe!

I used spicy V8, and since I'm lazy, I doubled the chicken broth then added the pasta at the end and simmered for 10 minutes. It's a great recipe, thanks for sharing it.

Made this for dinner last night and omg was it delicious! It looked great and tasted better! I served it with shredded parmesan on top and some garlic bread. Should have served a small salad as well, but oh well! It was very filling and pretty quick and simple to prepare. I will definitely make the often in the colder weather!

This was a big hit at our house! We try to watch our salt intake, so I used low sodium V8 and salt free chicken cooking stock for this recipe.  It turned out delicious, we'll definitely make this again.

Per the reviews used Spicy V8 juice.  Didn't have carrots/celery so instead used 1/2 bag of frozen Italian vegetables.  Cooked pasta separately then put right into the soup. Delicious!

This is the first time I have made pasta fagioli. We loved this soup. Will be making it again. I did cook the pasta in the soup before adding the meat and beans. Needed more broth so I ended up adding a can of tomato sauce and more chicken broth. Really good.

This soup was amazing! I liked it better than the chain restaurant version. I served my family the whole soup, salad and breadstick meal, they were all thrilled with the quality of the soup. I added red pepper flakes for a little spice.

Thought this was great.  Made a double batch, cooked all day (added beans only for the last hour and a half cook time) used a little more Basil and Oregano than the recipe called for, IT WAS DELISH!!!

This recipe is a new family favorite!  Only a few changes--husband doesn't care for V8 so I used plain tomato juice. And used elbow macaroni and kidney beans because that's what I had in the pantry.  But loved the flavor combinations of the recipe.

Very good. I had never made this before so I thought I would give it a try.  I like Olive Gardens version and this is just as good.   It is easy and hearty!  Great for cold fall days.  Very flavorful and filling.  Will definitely be making this again!

Kid's loved this, ages 2 1/2, 4 and 8.  Didn't have the beans in the recipe so I substituted a 19 oz can of 6 bean medley, though the chick peas in it picked up the soup flavours amazingly.  Used rotini pasta as well since I also didn't have the specified pasta and last used Mott's Clamato.  The result was a tangy new favorite for the kids!
