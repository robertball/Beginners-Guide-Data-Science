A great crowd pleaser.

SOME SUGGESTIONS: For a more authentic paella, used smoked paprika (sweet, not hot) and cut amt in half. Also, use chicken with the skin on. The flavor is wonderful in this dish. You can always put the skins off when you combine the rice/meats. Add a shake of turmeric (or colorante) to give the rice an even more brilliant color and don't be shy with the saffron. As much as you probably spent on the spice, put enough in to taste it. I put in a giant pinch and grind the threads with a few grains of salt or sugar before adding in.

Decent.  My main complaints are (i) because of cooking in separate dishes,
the rice and protein flavors don't blend, (ii) the dish is a bit drier
than paella should be, and (iii) there isn't enough vegetables (needs more
red bell pepper and peas and the like).  I much prefer the Paella I recipe
on this site.  Not only does it taste better, but it's actually easier to
cook (requiring no marinating time and only one pan on which to focus).
It's also easier to drop ingredients from a good recipe than figure out what to add to a okay recipe like this.

I loved this Paella.  Added 16 oz can diced tomatoes and left out the lemon zest.  Removed the casing and cut sausage into 2" pieces,cooking sausage ahead, drained the fat.  Added some back in the skillet for sauteing the chicken.  Added the shrinp to the rice mix just before the finish. I will do this again soon.

I've now made this recipe several times, and each time, I've done something different, but its always tasted fantastic.

My changes: instead of using shellfish (due to allergy), I fried fish separately, then cut it into strips, and added it to the meat.
Also, I didn't use red pepper flakes and I'm glad I didn't, because either the smoked paprika or the chorizo gave the meat mix lots of spice.
I also cheated with the lemon zest.  Since its not my favorite thing to do, I used McCormick's "California Lemon Peel".

Also, a lot of reviewers have complained about the cost of saffron (which is $10-13/gram), but I've found that Mexican Saffron-- aka "safflower" is a highly acceptable substitute.  It makes a VERY good saffron rice, it's only $1 for a quarter ounce, and you don't have to feel guilty about adding lots.  I've made it with both the Spanish/Moroccan saffron as well as Mexican saffron, and prefer the Mexican because it is quite good, easy to find, and doesn't break the bank.-- Basically, the difference in taste doesn't justify the money and time spent to acquire Spanish saffron.

Those were my main changes, everything else has always been little; the recipe is forgiving enough to come out great, almost no matter what.

I made this even easier by using prepackaged saffron rice instead of making my own.  I recommend cooking the chorizo separately and draining it before adding it to the mix. I also cooked the shrimp separately and added it at the end, since I think some of the shrimp tends to get overcooked if you have it in a large pot with many other items. I made this for my husband's birthday dinner, with a few tapas as appetizers, and it was wonderful!!!

Great Paella "Corrorian"! Paella, no matter how you make it, is always a bit time consuming but in the end, it's certainly worth it. After marinating my chicken, I cut the chorizo into bite size pieces and browned. I removed the sausage, then browned the chicken and then the peppers and onions. Everything was put back into my dutch oven along with a large can of crushed tomatoes. I simmered the meat and vegetables for a good forty minutes. From there I added chicken stock and the rice. The dish was fabulous!

I used chicken thighs, one per person, instead of pieces.  I doubled the saffron and also cooked the sausage first and drained the fat.  Keep extra chicken stock handy to moisten the rice if needed.  THEN (a personal touch)I cooked about 3 dozen mussels and 3 dozen clams and put on top of the dish.  My guests raved and I'll do it again and again....I don't care if it's not authentic paella, it's a great entertaining dish and delicious...

To get very moist rice, saute the finely diced onions until very translucent, approximately 15-20 mins., then proceed with Step 2. Approximately 13 minutes into rice cooking time, nestle shrimp and any shellfish desired in the rice; cover, and let steam until shrimp are opaque and shellfish open. Rice will come out perfectly moist with a bit of liquid remaining on bottom. Chorizo is available fresh (in meat case of most supermarkets) and dried (like pepperoni) and is  blister packaged and found hanging where dried jerky is found. Use the latter as it's fully cured and requires only a couple of minutes to heat.

Excellent with a few tweaks:
Marinate chicken and cook rice as called for however add a can of diced tomatoes with chilis to the cooking rice

Sauté onion with olive oil for approx 1 minute, add chorizo until it starts to give off oil and then add chicken and sauté all together until chicken cooks and chorizo beings to caramelize.  Add this to cooked rice and deglaze pan with red wine to get the flavorful bits and juices into the rice

Add ½ pound shrimp, ½ pound squid, and ½ pound mussels to the finished rice mixture at the end, cover until seafood is cooked, then serve

FABULOUS!  I substituted Sazon Seasoning for the Saffron and Bay Leaf, and used instant rice.  We actually clean the pot each time I make it!  Thanks a bunch!

Have been on a Saffron kick and just made this dish the other night.  Bottom line it is fantastic!  What a great meal.  Please not that if using saffron threads don't forget to steep the threads in a cup of hot water for about an 30 min to an hour prior to adding to rice and make sure to add the cup of saffron water to the rice.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I am not sure what paella is supposed to taste like, but this was fantastic!  Following other reviewer's advice I browned the chorizo (removed from dutch oven), then browned the chicken (removed from dutch oven), then browned the garlic/peppers/onion.  Poured in the stock (never realized this was so much richer than broth!), rice, spices and mixed the meats back in.  The lemon zest was key.  Simmered for about 1/2 hour covered and threw in the shrimp about 10 minutes before serving.  Subbed 2 packs of sazon instead of saffron.  Yum!  Very hearty and full of flavor.  I love one pot dishes!!  Thanks!

Yummy!  I cooked all of the "meats" in my wok since its my biggest pan, which worked out well.  I used one can of diced tomatoes in with the rice since I like a little tomato with my paella.  Our guests were impressed!

Excellent recipe!!  I only made 2 slight changes:

1. I added a green bell pepper as well.
2. I cooked the chicken, then then sausage, and then the rice & just did it all in 1 pot.

AMAZING FLAVOR.  My fiancee loved it and my future brother-in-law, who is a picky eater, went back for seconds and kept complimenting me on how good it was!

My wife made this for me for father's day and it was excellent. I love paella but I'm allergic to shellfish, so it was nice to find this recipe. She followed the recipe exactly and didn't experience flavor-blending or dryness problems that were mentioned by another reviewer. We will definitely make this again, soon.

I love this recipe!  I slice the chourico instead of grinding it, and add a little chicken broth to the chicken after I've browned it to ensure it cooks through.  Also instead of a pinch of saffron, I use a 1/2 tsp that I've crushed (that's what Ina recommends per 2 c rice) and having made this the first time with the pinch, I found the revised amount much more flavorful.

I cooked everything in one pot. Used bone in chicken thighs, seared first, removed from pan then sautéed the onion, garlic and sausage. Then I added rice, toasted it., added my chicken stock and then some tomato juice. Added the chicken back and let it all simmer. Added peas and shrimp last five minutes of cooking. Next time I will integrate the spices in with everything not just the chicken. Overall a great recipe to work from.

This was very, very, good.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the large amount of red pepper, which I think would have detracted from the dish had I used it.  I used 1/4 t., and more saffron, about 1/4 t. of threads.  The amount of paprika would probably be too much if everything was cooked together like a typical paella, but I liked it this way.  Cooking the rice separately speeds up cooking time and I do not think diminishes the end result.  I didn't have lemons so skipped the zest and didn't miss it.  Also, I started putting a lid on my skillet after adding the chorizo, because I was concerned about the chicken not cooking through; 2" chunks are pretty big. With the lid, the 30 minutes prep time and 30 minutes cooking time were accurate.  My seafood was very cold and needed a few more minutes, no biggie.  About saffron: The last few years I have been having great difficulty finding it in grocery stores, so took the plunge and bought 5 grams of La Mancha saffron on eBay for $30 including shipping.  It is an enormous amount compared to the little grocery store tubes, and will last for years.  With good deals on saffron and shrimp ($4/lb.), this was an economical dish and I look forward to making it again.

I was really looking forward to this dish, but it was nothing like paella I remembered from trips to Spain.  I followed the recipe very carefully; however, I was very disappointed with the results.  Specifically:

  * The combination of that much crushed red pepper and the zest from two full lemons made the rice very bitter (it made me wish I had saved my very expensive saffron). The rice would have been nearly inedible on its own without the chicken mixture to tone it down. I RECOMMEND cutting back on both the red pepper and lemon zest.

  * The chorizo nearly overpowered the dish. If I try the dish again, I will skip the chorizo (though I actually enjoy chorizo). I RECOMMEND:
   - Substitute a mild smoked sausage instead of chorizo
   - If chorizo is desired, 
     > Reduce the amount at least by half
     > If concerned by the fat, etc. of the chorizo, try substituting soy chorizo (or a 50/50 mix of soy and pork chorizo)
     > To prevent possibly serving undercooked chorizo, fry it separately before adding it to the chicken mixture

   * Consider enhancing the dish with additional types of shellfish; Since I'm a huge shellfish lover, I added pre-cooked hard-shell clams (heated until shells opened for 5 minutes in water, juice of 1/2 lemon, butter and some crushed garlic) and Jonah crab claws (boiled in bay seasoning for 6 minutes). I spooned the extra shellfish on top of the chicken/shrimp mixture with a little bit of the liquid from the steamed clams.

We really didn't care for this, rice was way too lemony, not enough saffron and dry. The meat mixture needed more red pepper/onions and maybe some other vegetables, and the "sauce" it made was kind of bland, won't be making this again :(

Just got back from a school trip to Spain, and the kids, teachers, and I (parent) had a "reunion party." Great recipe, but I made some changes for preference and availability: nobody wanted shrimp, so I omitted it; could not find saffron at my local market, so I used saffron rice.  Overall, it got raves from the kids & teachers at my Spanish dinner/tapas party, although some thought a bit too hot (pepper flakes).  Many asked for the recipe, and my husband loved the leftovers.  A keeper--thanks.

I lived in Spain for 2  years and I have to admit that this is not the most authentic reipe I've ever seen.  It's too spicey.  But, as a dish on it's own it is good.  I made it for an iron chef competition where the theme was yellow, and it got top marks for both color and taste.  I used the pre-mixed safron rice dinners that you can buy at the super market.  This saves a lot of money and a little bit of time, and the taste is just as outstanding.

I use this as my paella base recipe everytime and get so many compliments. Some things I've learned: 1. If you use brown rice, add a bit more liquid (maybe the juice form the lemon too or some extra broth) so that the rice cooks in more juice AND for longer than 20 min. until all is absorbed. 2. Don't be scared of the saffron. It's the secret ingredient in authentic paella. I use 3 or 4 times the amount asked for here. 3. I use spicy sausage. All around excellent recipe.

Wow, great recipe!  I made a few modifications simply based on personal preference.  I cut chicken into smaller pieces (about 1"), used chicken kielbasa, and no seafood (I know, I know...) Used arborio rice, substituted 1/2 cup of white wine for 1/2 cup of chicken stock (I think it brightens the flavors), and drizzled fresh lemon juice & chopped parsley over the final dish.  Enjoyed it outside on a hot day & served with the sauvignon blanc I used in the paella.  Absolute perfection ... thank you mls!

Very tastey! I made it for my family and my parents today. I used 3 chicken legs and 3 chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, I used skin on chicken, smoked sausage along with the chirozo, a huge pinch of saffron as suggested by another veiwer, and it was awesome!  Thanks!

This is a reasonably tasty seafood and rice dish, but it is not paella.  Real paella is a dish with a lot of regional variations, but the technique is always the same, and that technique is what makes it paella.  This isn't even close.

This was delicious! I usually use a lot of short cuts in making paella (prepackaged Spanish rice, no real veggies, etc.), but this is an easy version that is much healthier, and I will never go back!  I followed the recipe pretty close, except I cut out the chicken entirely, and used jalapeno chicken sausage instead of chorizo.  I also used short grain brown rice instead of white.  This was a wonderful meal that lasted through the week as leftovers.

My hubby liked it, I didn't.  I didn't think it was too original.  Just tasted like shrimp-chicken-ground sausage over rice.  I would recommend that after all the meat cooks, drain the grease and blood from the pan.  Ew.

Relatively easy to make.  I left out the lemon zest (not my favorite thing) and it turned out beautifully.  One of the best meals I have made from this website.  I mixed everything together at the end and let it cook for about 5-10 min covered.  Really good flavor!

This recipe was amazing. I'm from Iowa and my family is defintely a more steak and potatoes kind of group. I went to Spain for 2 weeks and came back with the idea for an ethnic food night once or twice a month just to get them to try new things.  This was my first choice and it was phenominal! Everyone loved it and it was just like being back in Spain.  Tip: I live in a rural area and was having a hard time getting saffron and chorizo sausage. If you have the same problem, try a Mexican grocery store. They usually have everything you'll need at a great price.  I got my saffron threads and the sausage for a total of $9 and it tasted perfect!

I absolutely love this recipe.  One thing I changed is that I combined the pans when the rice was nearly done and cooked it for a bit longer so the flavors combined more thoroughly.

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit.  After reading a bunch of reviews, I did a few things differently.  I used a package of saffron rice but otherwise did the rice the same way.  I actually made the rice earlier and reheated it before serving.  I added frozen peas to it when reheating.  When it came to the meat, I cooked the chorizo first and drained it on a lot of paper towels.  So oily!  I cooked the chicken, onion and red pepper in batches since there was so much of it.  At the end I cooked the shrimp on it's own.  When I served it, I put the rice down the center of a large platter and put the chicken, veggies and shrimp across the top pouring the cooking juices over the rice.  There was a non-red meat eater at the table so I put the sausage at only one end of the platter.  I made approximately a recipe and a half, and it made SO MUCH FOOD!  It was really delicious, and everyone absolutely loved it which was very gratifying.  It's a lot of work and a lot of last minute cooking so be prepared to be in the kitchen at the end.  It's a very impressive looking dish to serve to company.  It would be easy to tweak it anyway that you like.

Excellent dish.  I am in Central America and could not locate saffron.  So, I used achiote in its place.  Very tasty!

We loved the dish but made a few changes to "marry" the flavors better.  We sauted the chicken pieces separately and then the onion.  We added that to the rice part way through cooking, along with shrimp and pieces of a good poultry chorizo sausage which was packaged fully cooked. We added a couple tablespoons of white wine at that time also. Great aroma and flavor.

Loved this.  My father-in-law said it was "restaurant quality".  Did not change a thing.  Did have to search 3 grocery stores before I found saffron, but it was well worth it.  Make sure you use extra large skillets, this will feed a crowd!

This recipe is not as involved as the recipe  seems. It is actually quite easy.  And it's outstanding. I got rave reviews and will definitely make it again. I arranged it in a large flat paella dish and put steamed snap peas around the outer edge. Pretty as well as delicious!

This was a good recipe. If it wasn't called Paella I would have rated it higher as I don't think this tastes much like traditional Paella.  The only changes I made were adding tumeric to give the rice a more vibrant yellow color and topping with fresh parsley. Will consider making again.

Thought that this was great!  I would suggest adding a small can of crushed or diced tomatoes to the rice while it's cooking.  I will certainly make this again.

This was awesome! I loved the variety of flavors in this ranging from the lemon zest to the saffron and on to the savory side.  The crushed red pepper was perfect for us (just mildly spicy), and the chorizo added excellent flavor and body to the dish. 

I read through some of the tips & tricks and made it according to the recipe except: 1.)added a can of diced tomatoes to the rice as it cooked for 20 minutes. 2.)doubled the saffron and prepared it by grinding it up with a mortar and pestle and hydrating it in about 1/4 cup of boiling water 10 minutes before adding it per the recipe.

My family of 5 all loved it. My daughter even had her 13 year old friend over for dinner, and she gobbled it up as well.  Easily fed 6 people with enough for those who wanted seconds.  Even after that, we had enough to put a leftover serving in the fridge.

Fantastic all around and will definitely make this again!!  Thanks!!

Having lived in Spain I know what real Spanish Paella tastes like.  I must have had a few too many because I followed the recipe without really thinking and they (spanish people) NEVER put crushed red pepper in paella or atleast the amount called for in teh recipe.  Spanish food IS NOT spicy in general.  Please do yourself a favor and go lightly on teh red pepper.  The rest would have been wonderful without the crished red pepper.  Otherwise a good receipe. Always use fresh garlic and double whatever is called for!  :)

My granddaughter and I  ate this in Spain and it was very close.  The consistency wasnt exactly like what we had as it was more like an American casserole  but I used a large wok and put  under the broiler for about a minute.  It then had the sticky wonderful consistency we had in Spain.  Prior to this I never liked Paella. I'm making it again for the second time and will continue

This took way more than 30 minutes to prepare and definitely more than 30 minutes to cook. Still, the flavour was quite nice.

I've only had paella a once in a chain restaurant, so I'm not sure how authentic this recipe is, but it was very good. I looked at some of the other recipes and changed a few things. First off, I didn't have any saffron, or the $$ to buy it, so I did without. The chorizo I used was very greasy, so next time I'll cook that separately, drain some grease, and add it to the mix. I added tumeric to give it a yellow color, and thyme for a little more flavor. I also added about a half cup of white wine in place of a half cup of chicken stock, mostly because I love cooking with wine. Lastly, I added some diced tomatoes.

I am not sure where to start...  First of all, this recipe is not easy in sense of time and effort because it does takes quite a bit of work to put together (and should I mention money), but the recipe is easy to follow. It does not take 30 minute prep time like it suggests or just 5 minutes to cook the chicken (more like 5-8 minutes each side)   Second, the rice was a bit spicy with all the red pepper flakes it calls for and I am not sure I liked the flavors of the lemon zest and parsley in the rice or the taste of all the paprika in the chicken marinade.  Thirdly, the rice and meat proportions are off. There is far more meat than there was rice.   Lastly, this was a good recipe. I don't believe it was authentic paella though. I followed this recipe as stated only changing 2 things; short grain rice for long grain rice and used sliced smoked apple sausage rather than the crumbled chorizo.  Oh, and by the way, we spent $20 for a few threads of saffron!   Overall, I would recommend this recipe, it was good not great.

This recipe is fantastic - since I am on a "point" counting diet - I made a few minor changes - used tsp's of oil instead of tablespoons - no affect on the taste - also was out of paprika and used a little cumin - and used instant brown rice - lastly instead of chorizo sausage, I used hot lean Italian turkey sausage, minus the casings (3) - all combined it still had all of the flavor you would expect and very healthy.  Everyone in my family LOVED it.

We made this dish for a family gathering 
celebrating foods of the Caribbean.  Our extended family thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was fun and easy to put together.  We added scallops, clams and mussels.  Like many other reviewers, we used a yellow rice mix and added corn and peas to it.  We also browned and drained the chorizo in the skillet then cooked all the other meats in the drippings.

Delicious, and a guaranteed winner every time. I spruced this up a bit by adding 2 lbs. of fresh clams and a few strips of bacon. Also, I shred my chicken instead of cube it. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Other than adding more chicken and omitting the shrimp, I followed the directions exactly; I substituted saffron threads with saffron powder.  I think this is the best thing I've ever cooked.  My family enjoyed it, and said it was the best "mexican" food they ever had.  I don't think it tasted mexican, it had a distinct, new flavor I've never tasted, yet we all loved it.  I was told repeatedly how good it was.  I would suggest ANYONE to cook this, it is easy and you feel accomplished after crafting such a delicious meal.

This recipe is incredible!  An explosion of wonderful flavors, and has such a beautiful presentation!  The lemon zest in the saffron rice is refreshing and a nice contrast to the red pepper spices.  I was not sure I would like the flavor of the chorizo sausage -- but it is really tasty and makes the dish!  This is a definite keeper.

My husband agrees that it is not authentic paella, but when it tastes like this, who cares?  Great recipe!  The whole family gobbled it down and the 1-year-old had three bowls!  I didn't put the full amount of red pepper in, but brought the jar to the table for folks to add.  I think the only changes I made was to eliminate the shrimp, to use green bell pepper instead of red, and to eliminate the lemon zest.  I cooked the chorizo first and then cooked the chicken in the oil left by the chorizo.  

We all loved this recipe (fought over who got the leftovers the next day) and are planning to try it with different veggies in.

This was great. I cut the recipe in half and it still worked great. Wait to start the chicken until the rice is done (more time to marinate). Saffron is yummy, but very pricey. I think I will try the saffron rice sold in the stores next time. I would recommend adding salt and pepper to the rice. Also, I used smoked hot links instead of chorizo and it was fabulous. Mix all of the rice into the skillet with the meat at the end and the sausage will help to flaver and the rice. mixture. Thanks for the recipe...it gets into the rotation!

Excellent recipe. Delicious and tasty. I added a half teaspoon of Vegeta,  in with the chicken coating and I substituted Italian sausage with basil for the chorizo sausage because I don’t care for that smoked flavor. Then I finally added a little lobster meat in with the shrimp. My guests were ecstatic. It took me a little longer than 1 hour because I was not prepared and it ended up taking me 1 hour and 45 minutes from start to finish.

Recently, my wife and I went on holiday to Barcelona.  One of the things we were looking forward to some nice paella.  What we found there was horrible!

This recipe is absolutely delicious and is well on the way to becoming a family favourite.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  We keep kosher so I left out the seafood and used beef sausage.  I also used saffron rice and added peas.  I can't wait to make it again!

This is a terrific dish.  I used Aidell chorizo which is a turkey/chicken sausage.  I didn't change anything else and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

loved this recipe...after reading some reviews, I decided to leave the lemon out (just used it to decorate the platter)..and add a bag of frozen peas as well as three diced Roma tomateos...I purchased the Saffron ($17 for 4 small vials, all of which I used as I doubled the recipe), but not sure that it made a difference! and if I cannot find it cheaper will prob. just add turmeric next time to add yellow color....I used thighs instead of breasts but w/o the skin (too much fat!)...loved the chorizo sausage, next time will use fresh shrimp instead of already cooked frozen...

It's my first time to cook this dish. I made a few changes - used half ordinary white rice and half sweet rice, have to add more broth to the rice as sweet rice absorbs more liquids. Served this on New Year's eve - my family liked it a lot. One of my kids even returned the next day for the left-overs!  :)

So, I made this worried my roommates would hate it (they're totally picky). I did leave out the crushed red pepper flakes because one roommate can barely even handle black pepper and I thought with the chorizo I might already be pushing it. Turns out this was a good choice, because I made it and he said it was PERFECT, and it tasted SO GOOD. Every bite was gone. Otherwise, I followed the instructions exactly.

Fantastic! My son raved about the flavor. I added some chicken thighs too. I also took another's suggestion and omitted lemon and replaced it with diced tomatoes. Will make again very soon. Couldn't find short grain rice. Used medium grain.

Very tasty, superb texture, wonderful aroma, but most of all, so easy!  The next time I make it, I will cook the meats in a wok for better browning; otherwise, no changes whatsoever.  I froze the leftovers and they reheated nicely.

First time making it today, and it was wonderful IMHO! My boyfriend and his roommate loved it as well! I did however substitute the saffron threads with the 'Goya Sazon' and also some tumeric powder for color. Other than that I also added a squeeze of lemon after everything was finish to add some more zesty flavor. Topped it with green onions for more color. So easy and great taste, definitely will make it again soon! Thanks for the recipe :)

We really enjoyed this Paella very much, unfortunately I used ground chorizo that had a lot of Heat, and this really impacted the overall meal.  Next time I will use chorizo Saugage links and slice them so they can be passed up individually.  I also used lobster which was a terrific add.

Yummy & easy.  I halved this recipe for the two of us & I used a bunch of substitutions since I just needed a bit of a reminder what all goes in Paella.  THE SAFFRON IS ESSENTIAL!  Turmeric will turn it yellow but adds the wrong flavour entirely - tends toward bitterness.  And yes, I like to use a lot of saffron when I cook with it - I used three pinches of it along with two bay leaves.  Breakfast sausage, frozen chopped turkey breast and bay scallops (all bits & pieces from the freezer) went in mine.  Instead of paprika & crushed red pepper flakes I used ground chipotle peppers, and ditched the flat leaf parsley and chicken stock.  I also put a big glug of lemon juice on top of the meats and onion/pepper mix before folding it into the basmati rice I chose to use.  It tastes best with a good grinding of alder smoked sea salt crystals on top and a lot of freshly ground pepper.

My husband was surprised that he liked it, as simple as it is.  His favorite question when I'm cooking dinner is "Have you made this before?" which really means "Do I like this?"  This is a good recipe for cleaning out your freezer (as is jambalaya.)

Very easy, changed it up a bit and cooked everything one at a time in the paella pan. Meat, veggies, and shrimp first and then followed the rice recipe. Brought them all together once the rice was done.

Excellent recipe. I could not find any saffron so had to leave it out but still ended up fantastic. I added fresh mussels and fresh calamari. I also used fresh oregano rather than dry and fresh chilli. Absolutely loved it!

Paella is one of my husband's favorite dishes at restaurants, I made this for him as a surprise but worried it wouldn't be good enough. He loved it! It is time consuming but not difficult. It looks impressive and would be great for a dinner party. I was hesitant to buy saffron threads for $17 but you use so little and I could make this recipe at least 8 more times with the same bottle. I had trouble getting the rice to cook. I slowly kept adding more broth until it absorbed and got softer. This recipe is a keeper!

My son made this dish as a course assignment in his high school Spanish class.  It took about two hours to make, teaching the novice cook how to prep food.  Overall, this is a 5-star recipe for flavor and texture. The delicate blend of lemon zest with the bite of red pepper, the hint of saffron, and the savory flavor of garlic, with a little parsley kick, stir fried in olive oil made the rice the best part of the dish. We discovered that the best meat in the mix was the shrimp. He used the small salad shrimp, rather than raw shrimp with the tails on, and this worked out perfectly, by adding the shrimp in at the very end so as not to overcook them. The chorizo had flavor of its own with more of a dusky taste which was slightly overwhelming to the delicate flavor of the rest of the dish. He thought that the next time the meats should be a mix of scallops and shrimp. He cooked the chorizo separately to cut back on some of the fat in the dish. It was wise to rinse the chorizo, not only to decrease the fat but particularly in light of its strong flavor. We were a little surprised that the recipe called for 2" pieces of chicken. The chicken could have been cut a little smaller for more flavor from the rub.  We were initially surprised that this dish was for 8 servings, but after the explosion of flavor, it was about right. We all cleaned our bowls! It was so good we are still savoring the lingering flavor from the meal. Very filling.  He did a fantastic job.

I couldn't find saffron anywhere and made several other changes. The end result was still delicious, even if it wasn't completely authentic.

This is awesome! The rice alone is outrageous! I love rice and could not stop eating it! I used the zest of one lemon instead of two and it was just right. I used mild italian sausage instead of chorizo because that is what I had on hand. I reduced the red pepper to 1/3 tsp and paprika to 1 tsp for the kids' sake (3 & 5 yr old) and it's a good thing I did - the mild sausage was spicy enough for them (though very mild for the parents). Other than that, I used 1 tbsp dried parsley and the rest as directed. Just fabulous!

Very good! I used andouille sausage and instead of shrimp I used clams and mussels. Also added a dry white wine to rice and my meat/seafood. ( broth was delicious) Tip.... I added a packet of Sazon to my chicken marinade!

Oh so tasty! At first taste, seemed a little bland, but then that little fire hit our tastebuds. We don't like really hot food so used 1/4 tspn ground red pepper and vidalia onion. Not a fan of oregano so used marjoram, no lemons, so used lemon juice, couldn't find chorizo sausage so used sweet italian. With about 5 minutes left for rice to cook, mixed rice and meat pans together and let simmer to marry the flavors even more. Can't wait for leftovers tonight! Next time, would use just sausage and shrimp, due to personal preference. Thanks for the recipe mls.

This was amazing!  Instead of just shrimp I used mussles, shrimp, calamari, and scallops.  I also doubled the crushed red pepper since I like the spice.  I also cut out the olive oil in step 3 for cooking the chicken.  I figured since the chicken is marinated in oil Pam spray would would fine.  I didn't have saffron so I used termeric.  It was amazing!

I used a paella pan, and medium grain rice.  Note  - long grain rice will not absorb the flavors and liquid for a true paella. Even then  adjust your liquid in the paella to match the ratio on the rice instructions.  I used a smoked papika and a good saffron.  I bought  McCormick's spices at Safeway and both were on sale!  Often the saffron is behind the service counter and not in the spice section of the grocery store.   Fresh seafood is a must and can be substitued for the sausage and the chicken.  I prefer chicken thighs over white meat because of the moisture of the darker meat and the bone which adds flavor.  Made this with Clams, sea scallops, shrimp and mussels they worked beautifully. I used the water I steamed  the seafood in, in leu of the chicken stock.  The paella pan really helps the dish in the distribution of heat and the nice carmelization of the rice on the bottom of the pan.  We have an electric range and I used two burners to heat the paella pan turning the pan often in the last stage of cooking.  I do agree with reviewers who said a charcoal of gas grill would be  a plus but, with snow on the ground the electric stove did fine. Portions are very generous expect leftovers.  Great recipe and a very fun and beautiful dish to serve.

Made this dish and it came out perfect, Although I used the pre-packaged yellow rice with the saffron-seasoning already in it. I read alot of the other reviews and people mentioned cooking things separately. I read somewhere that paella was to be cooked over hot coals so that is the way that I did it (on my cheesy weber coal bbq) it came out perfect that way. Only suggestion for that cooking method is that you have all the ingredients ready to go, you can't turn down hot coals.

I think this would have been a better recipe if the amount of chorizo was cut in half.  The chorizo dominated the flavor and took away the flavor of shrimp, chicken, and red pepper.

Incredible Paella! I added some peas, and marinated the prawns in tomato sauce, basil, seasoning salt, black pepper and olive oil for a 10 minutes before adding them to the mixture. Turned out wonderfully!

Excellent!  A big hit, even with the kids.  The only change I made was to use a chicken sausage instead of choritzo because it's what I had.  Next time I make it (and there will be a next time) I will reduce the oregano to 1 tsp. because it was a little strong for my taste.

This recipe was amazing.  We used arborio rice which needed a bit less than 20 minutes of cook time, in my opinion.  I also made this without the chicken, just shrimp and chorizo.

This was beyond delicious! I did decrease the red pepper flakes by half, because that was the preference of my guests. I also decreased the paprika by half, as suggested by other reviewers.  I stirred a can of diced tomatoes (drained) into the cooked rice. The only change I would make is to cook the chorizo first to drain it (as its quite greasy), and then simmer with the other meats to let the flavors blend. Thanks for the recipe!! Served with sangria!!

Great recipe!  Before you make it, be aware that it makes a ton of food.  

I made a few minor changes.  First, I cut up a whole chicken (about 3lbs) into about 10 pieces and cooked the meat on the bone and with the skin on.  I marinaded the meat in the olive oil/paprika/oregano mixture for a few hours before hand to make sure it wasn't bland. I cooked the chiken for a few minutes longer due the the pieces I used being larger.  

Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  I probably used a touch more than a pinch of safron in the rice.

I liked this, and I had three guys helping me making it, which cut down on the prep time.  We went to the Mexican grocery market for fresh chorizo, and bought saffron boles there as well.  (Thanks to the reviewer who pointed me to Mexican saffron!  Or azafran, as the package label calls it.)

We steamed mussels and added those.  Yummy.  You can also add the steamed "juices" from the shellfish to the paella sauce, if you so desire.

The rice turned out wonderfully.  I gave this whole recipe four stars as I wasn't thrilled with it necessarily, but it was good and certainly worth making.  The rice was five star rice for sure.

I used wing drummettes rather than chicken breast.  I browned them before the other ingredients, removed them and added them back when the stock and rice were added so they could finish cooking.  Also added frozen peas.  When ready to serve I squeezed lemon juice over all.  Very good!

It is an awesome dish. I 'fished' it up a little by adding some sardines! It is also nice to sautee the shrimps in some olive oil with garlic. The italian parsely is essential, so it the lemon zest. The red bell pepper should still be crispy. Some black olives compliment it all, make it real spanish. The name Easy Paella is not completely true, it takes some work to put it together, but is it worth it. Put some italian parsely, shrimps, lemon slices and olives on top, to make it look real good!

despite the long list of ingredients this is pretty easy.  i would add another cup of rice and quadruple the  garlic and add more peppers to make it hotter.  more rice to match the amount of meat it is immense!  i fed 7 people with this. guys.  and we had leftovers.  i used mexican saffron.  spanish saffron is too expensive.  i added some red chili powder to the meat(i love it spicy).  more salt and pepper.  all the meats together tasted wonderful.  everybody loved it.  this one is in my recipe box and in rotation.

This recipe was fantastic... I did substitute tumeric (spelling?) for the saffron (1 tsp.) as I wasn't about to spend $20 on four threads of saffron... one day I will though.  I also did feel that it wasn't necessary to add oil to the pan when cooking the chicken as the marinade had plenty already.  Lastly I did keep draining the fat off of the meats as it did get pretty greasy from the chorizo.  My whole family loved it.  Not real spicy but did have a good kick to it.

Yay!  this recipe was awesome!  Once we got all the ingredients together we were good to go..so easy.
I couldn't find the rice so I got a bag of Vigo yellow Spanish rice and cooked it to its own directions.  It came out great and so delicious.  We did without the lemon/red pepper flakes.  I also added some Paellero seasoning w/saffron.  It was a hit and a keeper.  Thanks again ;-)

i used saffron rice as well, and green bell pepper. i substitued some cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes (maybe only 1/2 tsp), omitted the shrimp, and added tomato. it was a huge hit -- my best friend, for the first time, asked for the recipe, and she's not a big cook. this was an easy, flavorful dish.

I've never had real paella, so I can't compare. But this recipe was good on its own, easy to make and doesn't take much time. I only used half as much chicken and chorizo and no shrimp at all. I also left out the lemon, used two jalapenos instead of the bell pepper and used extra saffron. If I make this again, I will probably just make the rice part and leave out the meat.

amazing.  I made this in a hurry as we have invited guests over and ended up using chicken that was cut for stir fry and didn't zest the lemons (I couldn't figure out what zesting meant!)

It was amazing - rave reviews and easy to make.

thanks for sharing.

Really good! I only changed it by adding mushrooms and broccoli and both green & red pepper, just to upp the vege content. When I had the leftovers I added a tomato to them - most paella's do have tomato so maybe next time I will add tomato when cooking the rice...anyway thanx for great recipe - really enjoyed it!

This was very good.  I used basmanti rice and did not add sausage.  I put small scallops  (same time as shrimp) and a can of drained clams (at the last 5 minutes of cooking).  My family loved it.  It was the best!

This recipe was delicious, easy to make, and works well as a leftover dish.  This paella is definitely a crowd pleaser, and it's a medley of great flavors and aromas.

Loved it! Easy & quick-I made it for company & got raves!  I think I will try slicing the sausage next time instead of crumbling.. Definitely will make this again!

My husband and I lived in Spain years ago and we loved this recipe. There are a few things I'll change next time. I'll omit the chili flakes as true Spanish rice is not spicy and much more bland than this recipe. I'll use 1/4 t salt and 1/8 t pepper in the marinade. I'll also start the bell pepper and onion cooking at the same time I start the chicken to ensure there's no crunch left. Otherwise I'll leave it alone as it is great!

This was my first try at making paella and it turned out great. The only ingredient I changed was the sausage.  I used apple smoked chicken sausage from trader joes. The dish was excellent, but it took more than the estimated time of 30 minutes to prepare. The only thing I would change would be instead of taking the casings off, which was time consuming, I would leave them on and slice it instead.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I marinated my chicken for almost an hour, added 160z of tomatoes and packaged saffron rice as recommended, and forgot to add peas at the end, but even with those modifications it came out quite nicely. I'm a novice cook, but this was easy to follow and didn't take very long (about 1.5 hour).

Loved it!  It's been years since I've tasted this dish, and it didn't make a lasting impression then, so I wasn't sure if I wanted to try it on my own.  Not knowing what it should taste like, I can say that I love the flavors in this recipe.  I didn't stray too far, but I used chicken instead of shrimp & chorizo.  And I made everything in one pan.  My husband & kids loved it too.  This will be added to the menu rotation!

This was delicious! Followed the recipe as is but mixed the seafood and meat with the rice at the end when cooking the shrimp so that the juices from the meat/shrimp mix into the rice. Used medium grain rice because there was no short grain at my grocery store. Also I have to note, the zest of lemon was worth it. It really added to the recipe. My husband and I loved it!

It lives up to its title: easy. I use only genuine Spanish chorizo and I substitute a yellow rice brand that contains saffron. I also add some pork and sometimes calamari. it isn't true Spanish Paella, but it is as close as I need to be.

First time making any type of paella and this was a HIT!! My husband raved! I was concerned because I didn't have lemons so I used my lemon essential oil (8 drops oil = 1 lemon). I thought for sure I ruined it with too much lemon! But it turned out great! The lemon offset the hot red pepper and complemented the sausage and shrimp and chicken! I also used a smoked sausage and long grain rice instead and it was perfect! Love this recipe!

This recipe was delicious and so easy to make. True it is not "authentic" but it was tasty and definitely contains the flavors of Spain. The only changes I made were to use Spanish chorizo and cut it into chunks rather than crumble . . . I also substituted saffron for a rice seasoning mix I bought in Barcelona (it contained saffron and other seasonings, but didn't overpower with the additional rice ingredients in this recipe). I will definitely be making this again!

This was absolutely scrumptious!!  I did not have chorizo, so I used a little kielbasa - it was good in there because it adds that extra smoky flavor.  This was my first time cooking with saffron and I could really taste it!  Fabulous "keeper" recipe.  A real family-pleaser.

Amazing.  Followed one reviewer's advice and used chicken thighs instead of breasts to pump up the savor/flavor.  

We had this for breakfast, lunch and dinner the day after and it was completely gone.  New family favorite, added to the staple rotation.

I give this one 5 stars for being easy to make and very tasty. The modifications I made: For presentation purposes, I chopped the chorizo in pieces instead of crumbling it. Looks better when you serve it. I added seafood paella mix (crab, mussels, etc) and marinated it with the chicken. Makes it that much yummier and more filling. Also, after everything was done, I emptied the rice into the saucepan with the meats and mixed thoroughly before serving. I served a spinach/escarole salad with olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper dressing as an appetizer to clean the palate and help with digestion. I didn't have time to make dessert but I would serve a not too sugary Key Lime pie or a nicely charged Tiramisu, also to clean the palate and help with digestion. Enjoy!

Great recipe even as a vegetarian dish. Made it with vegetable broth, soyrizo, and seitan. Could've done with half the red pepper flakes as it was a bit spicy for my taste, but overall a great and easy recipe.

Made first time for a dinner party, was a huge hit! Mother in law loved it on the 2nd take too. Used rice with saffron already in it (Goya brand I think), browned it slightly before cooking in large skillet.  Browned marinated chicken, added with rice to cook through. I took other reviewers suggestion and used dry chorizo, cut into bite size pieces, quick sautee with onion, peppers, and shrimp added into the dish for serving.  I meant to add the peas, but forgot and no one noticed.  I would have liked a little sweet from the peas to offset the spicy chorizo, so will be sure to include next time.

Awesome recipe! I added peas, scallops and shrimp. And used store bought yellow rice. Cooked according to directions. But I saved the juice from the meats and veggies, and added 3/4 cup of chicken stock to the meat. Then I mixed the rice and meat together. It was really good! Next time, I'll try with andoullie sausage for a kick. Thanks for sharing.

This paella was absolutely perfect.  We modified it for Lent, substituting tilapia, shrimp and mussels.  The result was flavorful and well balanced.  The lemon zest made all the difference!!  Everyone loved it!!

The flavor on the saffron rice was perfect, I would use that portion of this recipe over and over again. The seperate "meat pile" has a few problems that others have mentioned. I appreciate the attempt to simplify things by putting them all together, but it left me feeling like I ended with a less than ideal presentation of each of the three proteins.

I use the shrimp/prawn shells and make a bit of shrimp stock. Use a 3 part chicken stock to 1 part shrimp stock. Just puts a different back note in to the flavour. Also I cook the chorizo first then cook the chicken in that same pan. Yeah, I know, not as "fat free" as some would like, but love that flavour.

WOW. This was so good, that my fiance went back for 5ths, and so easy that I will happily make it for us again. I made no changes, which is rare for me, and it came out PERFECT.

1st time with this recipe for work potluck, and unanimous approval. I added yellow bell pepper for flavor and color, used Turmeric instead of Saffron, and only had chicken for protein.  Good flavor, rice had a nice but not overpowering spice.

Easy to make and delicious!  I would use a bit less chicken than it calls for - same amounts of the other items.

My husband loved this dish, but says that next time I should leave out the chicken and just have the shrimp and chorizo. I agree. It was a little dry from so much meat and not enough "sauce." When we had the leftovers, I added chicken broth to the meat mixture, and also stirred the leftover rice into the leftover meat mix. I think it would be better if the two mixtures were combined from the beginning.

I made this recipe last night for my family.  All I can say is OMG!! This was so yummy.  I cannot wait to make it again.  I did not change a thing.  next time I may add some rings of smoked sausage.  I love how the recipe is broken down into ingredient sections.  this is so easy to make.  I cannot stop raving about it to my friends and they all want the recipe :)

Did not come out as tasty as I had hoped, was a little bland. Would try again, maybe it was the chef's fault, I am not that savvy in the kitchen!

Love it!  This is really pretty easy and very flavorful.  I did not have saffron and substituted saffron rice, not next time.  I'm going to scour the tow until I find it.  This makes 8 servings but there were seconds & thirds around our table, so there wasn't much left over for lunch the next day.

If you make this, make it as directed, then the next time you will know what you want to tweak.  

For us, next time, it's going to include clams, mussels, and calamari.  I'm going to do chicken wings separated instead of the cubed breasts.

This makes a HUGE amount of paella! My boyfriend and I tried to polish it off ourselves over the course of a few nights, but ended up bringing in reinforcements (in the form of his roommate)! Next time, we'll halve the recipe. Not entirely authentic, from what I know, but good enough.

Basic yet super delicious paella! For meats, I used chicken and chorizo  with some extra veggies rather then fish or the others mentioned. Very colorful and pretty dish, very savory!

This was an excellent dish.  My husband loved it.  I used kielbasa instead of chorizo for my own personal preferences, but I really think that you could use almost any meat.

Okay, this is for all the not so good cooking men out there. This was a challenge to prep all the ingredients by myself. However, the payoff was worth it. It was really good. The only thing done differently was the addition of mussels and extra water for cooking the rice.

IF I CAN DO THIS ANYONE CAN.

I thought this was good.  I boiled bone-in skin on thighs and then shredded the meat and used the broth as the chicken stock in the recipe. I also put the onions in the rice for more flavor instead of in the meat.  I also added one six ounce can of drained clams. My husband loved it.  The spice was a bit much for my 2 year old though.

This was a great recipe, but you definitely need more prep time to chop veggies & devein shrimp, etc.  That said, I added green olives, fresh cut up tomatoes and extra onion to this recipe to add more flavor.  I also used the yellow saffron rice - might take a little longer than 20 minutes to cook - I used a pizza pan to cover the very large paella pan I had.  I cooked all of the meat and added it to the paella, except the shrimp - I did that 5 minutes before serving so they wouldn't get rubbery.  I put the paella pan into the oven on a low temp to keep warm until ready.

Fantastic. Have made it several times. For vegetarians and vegans substitute portabella or any mushrooms for chicken, use soy sausage and leave out shrimp. No problem.  Awesome.

I agree with other reviews that it is drier than other paella recipes and cooking the rice and meat separately keeps the flavors from mixing.

This recipe was fantastic!  Made it last night for dinner after reading some of the reviews I let my chicken and shrimp marinate.  I omitted the lemon and add extra heat with some cayenne pepper. Will be making this again and again.

Easily one of the best meals I have made in a long time.  Who knew, my search to use up some chicken and chorizo in the freezer would give me my families new favorite meal!  Did not really change much.  Used dried parsley instead of fresh, not quite a whole lemon zested and no shrimp.  The rice cooked way longer then 20 minutes to get the consistency I wanted with a crispy bottom and edges.  I also like the idea of making the rice and meat portions in separate pans.  YUM!!

I followed the suggestion for smoked paprika, but did not adhere to less lemon zest which I really wish I had. It was WAY too lemony for my liking.  My family thought it was just OK and should not make it again without tweeking it.

LOVE this recipe!  I use a little less red pepper flakes for the kids.  Also, to make it simple sometimes, I skip the saffron threads and use Vigo Saffron Yellow Rice.  Not quite as flavorful, but we still like it!

My wife and I just made this one and the outcome could not have been better. I highly recommend replacing the chorizo with smoked turkey sausage to go easy on the fat.
Great recipe.

This was really tasty. The only changes I made were to use soy chorizo (lower calorie and less greasy) and I added artichokes and peas. I used Arborio short grained rice and it was perfect in this. This was really filling and with a green salad was a perfect meal

We eat vegetarian most often; since the ingredients sounded really flavorful, I prepared this with a vegetarian twist.  Substituted the chicken stock with vegetable stock, and instead of the meats, I used kohlrabi, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and black beans.  The family loved it!

I left out the shrimp because I'm not a big seafood person, but this was delicious! There was a ton of leftovers cause I made so much, and it was very easy to reheat for lunch the next day.

I have never had this dish before but it sounded so good just had to try. I absolutely loved it!!! It does take more time than other dishes but so worth the effort. I did cut back the red pepper flakes by half only because I do not like overly spicy foods, but I did add extra garlic. This is definetly a keeper.

Really amazing and a lot more simple than other recipes I've tried, but doesn't compromise on flavor. I added monkfish and mussels too, in addition to the whole prawns. Be sure to cook the mussels separately and only stir them in at the end!

My family loves this recipe. Of course I had to change a couple things and use what I had on hand. I added green onions, corn, spinach and green chiles and a couple jalapenos instead of peppers.

This was really good and I'll make it again.  It was lacking a little flavor just after I finished it.  However, this is definitely a "better the next day" dish.  It was great the second time around.  I wasn't willing to spend the $ on saffron so used a little tumeric and cumin, as others suggested.  I also used a cup of prepackaged saffron rice and a cup of jasmine rice.  I found 32oz of chicken stock to be just fine.  Be sure to use chicken stock, not broth.  It's much more flavorful.

This dish was excellent! I have never made Paella before and as a first time it was a family pleaser. I could not find smoked Paprika so I substituted some Chipotle spice in its place, worked well as it is smoky with a bite. I did place the entire combined dish into the oven with a large can of diced tomatoes, as recommended by another, this added some more color with nutrition.

FANTASTIC!  This was a relatively easy meal to prepare.  Due to budget concerns & lack of availability, I omitted the saffron and used rosemary instead.  While I can't tell if using one over the other helped/hurt this recipe, I must say that it turned out quite well.

When my boyfriend walked in the kitchen and said, "mmm, jambalaya!" I realized that, though easy, this recipe is lacking the essential seafood that makes authentic paella.  That said, it is simple and hearty.  Next time, I'll make the real thing.

Very spicy; if I make this again I will cut down on the chicken marinade and cut the red pepper for the rice in half.  It was delicious, but my husband didn't finish his because it was so hot.  Also, this made a huge quantity of meat compared to the amount of rice.  For future, will cut meat quantities in half.

this recipe was great.

I kinda free-styled it, as my wife always cooks rice in the rice cooker and then we freeze it...  I tossed the garlic, chicken (added some cabbage) and onions and such in a pan and tossed them around for a while, and then added some small clams instead of shrimp, and let it cook on medium for a while... in a seperate pan, I browned the garlic, and then tossed in some reheated rice, and added the chicken stock... once it got boiling, and added the other pot, and folded it in...

I came out excellent... I think this is a recipe that allows you liberty, which is the best kind of recipe...
good on ya!

I loved it!  I ended up not doing the rice like the recipe called for, but instead cooked yellow rice.  Also, for the chicken/sausage mixture, I added in a clove of fresh garlic, carrot (I didn't have any bell pepper), a bay leaf and the crushed red pepper (instead of adding it into the rice mixture).  It gave the meat a wonderful flavor!  My fiancee seemed to enjoy it as well--definitely a keeper and will make again!  Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe as my base, i used chicken on the bone not cutlets, added sausage all my with chorizo  and used a medium grain rice because I think short grain is just  too starchy. It was a wonderful dish, I love one pot meals, but my rice was too starchy, and that's the was a little disappointed, as paella rice is light and fluffy. I'm thinking next time to use a Carolina rice and give a rinse, but it was a very delicious meal!

Great recipe, made a few tweaks. We used 3 cups uncooked rice, about 30 saffron stems, added 8 oz cooked mussel meat, and 4 lobster tails, or 1 per person.

This recipe imo, defeats the one pot nature of paella.

I jumped right in and noticed in the middle of cooking, that it calls for adding the meat, separately onto the bed of rice?  My oversight.

When I make paella, I brown the meat, remove, degrease the pan, deglaze the pan with the broth, add the spices then the rice.  After arrange the chicken, sausage and seafood.  Everything cooks together beautifully. 

I typically splurge on the seafood including scallops and even crab legs. 

This one was meh.

I've  been to Spain where Chorizo is big, but I don't like it because of the high fat content. I substituted bulk Italian turkey sausage, but I think it would have been good with just extra shrimp too.

I used 1/2 t. red pepper flakes and used red sweet peppers with seeds. It was just the right amount of heat for my liking. You can always add more at the end. Same with the saffron and salt & pepper.

This was yummy. I followed the recipe. My husband doesn’t care for shrimp, but he tried it anyway. He really enjoyed it. He said, I could make it again and he would eat it. He even suggested that I make it for my next dinner party.

Made this exactly as called for except used dried parsley.  My husband requested this and I didn't know what it was so looked it up here.  He thought it tasted very good and I enjoyed it for something different.

Whereas the tastes in this recipe are good, there are a couple of technical errors that hold this recipe back in terms of the preparation:

1.  Because the chicken is being covered by a "red" mixture, there has to be more control in cooking the chicken to ensure that it is not pink in the center. Just tucking chicken into your recipe on it's own does not ensure that the chicken will be properly done when you are finished, especially when you are still tossing other ingredients in such as shrimp and sausage. 

2.  When cooking rice you need to make sure you rinse the rice at least three times before putting it into your recipe. By not taking the time to mentioning this, you are assuming that the cook already knows this, whereas not everybody does. 

There have to be edits done to this recipe in order for the food to be prepared safely. If you are going to have chicken cooked, especially if covered in a red mixture, you need to have the chicken cooked seperate from the rest of the dish. Please also ensure the rice is rinsed in order to ensure that there aren't any other harmful things that could get those who are eating it, sick. Other than this, it tastes really good. I didn't have two skillets, so I prepared the rice in a large sauce pan and it came out fine.

I turned this recipe into a seafood only dish.I used a big bag of mixed frozen seafood from Costco and saved some fresh shrimp and scallops for the top presentation.I needed to double all of the spices.I think that the lack of chicken and sausage would have made the paella bland.I also followed the advice from another post and precooked all of the seafood just enough to slightly pink the shrimp.This helped control the process for me.I served 13 people and had some leftovers.Everyone devoured it and went back for seconds.I served barbecued sausage and chicken on the side for the meat eaters.

This was an easy recipe to follow, and my guests enjoyed it. I added mussels. Next time I'd try to get a better chorizo and use less of it. I'd also cut up the chicken in a nicer way as presentation is part of the fun of cooking paella. I made it about an hour before guests arrived and placed it in a warm oven. I served it with crusty bread, a green salad, and flan with berries for dessert. I'll definitely make it again.

Have never heard of or made this before, my daughter (15 years old) has a Spanish meal tomorrow and chose to make this dish. We followed the original recipe. When I saw the recipe and thought jambalaya, I am from New Orleans and have to say this is delicious! Super easy to make, very flavorful! Will definitely make again!! They are in separate dishes because they are for her class mates tomorrow>

An excellent recipe! I'd never tried paella before, but both my kids love it so I gave it my best shot. This recipe is easier than it looks on first blush and very tasty.

What I'd change when doing it again:

Definitely halve the recipe. I did and it barely fit into my biggest deep-sided pan, and even my teenagers couldn't eat all of it!

I couldn't find chorizo so used 3 hot Italian sausages, casings off, cooked and crumbled beforehand. They added a nice spice but it could even go one more, the overall dish was not too hot.

I couldn't for the life of me find short-grain rice so I opted for a mix of arborio and long grain (cleaning out the cupboard!) and it worked perfectly. I used half again the amount of rice called for (so for a half recipe / 4 servings, I used 1.5 cups rice and 3 cups chicken broth) and it was great.

I added tomatoes and turmeric based on other reviews, and both were delicious. Next time I might add peas.

I got the meat cooked while getting the rice prepped, and then after five or ten minutes of the rice at a boil I mixed the meat and its juice into the rice to finish cooking all together in one pan. This made for a prettier presentation and better flavor than cooking separately.

It helps to do all the chopping early, as well as browning the sausage and getting the chicken in the spice mixture to marinate. Then when it's cooking time you can just dump everything into a pan as needed.

That sounds like a lot of complicated info but really, this is not

Excellent. I used boned chicken thighs, which are more flavorful, and I also added frozen peas right at the end.

I’m not a fan of paella from authentic restaurants but my husband says he likes it. I tried this recipe and to be honest I liked it.  Per suggestion from someone else I used a can of diced tomatoes with Chile peppers in addition to the chicken stock for the rice.  I also used jasmine long grain rice  as that’s what I had on hand; my favorite part is the way all the flavors blend together including the Italian parsley garnish... my husband says paella is tricky to make but this was very tasty. Even my 3 yr old ate it!

This paella came out fantastic! Served to 11 guests last night and they all said it was great. Proof is that 95% was eaten. I doubled the recipe to feed 11. I highly recommend this Easy Paella recipe.

This is pretty good but Spanish (hard) chorizo should be used not Mexican.  However,Mexican chorizo is delicious as is the Spanish, so I would use Mexican to add to the flavor and Spanish to add to the texture.  Also, some Spanish olives (green Castelvetrano) should be added for a more authentic taste. This olive is lower in salt but you may have to pit them before adding them to this dish.

This is a great base for the paella.  I omit paprika & lemon.  I poach  the chicken and shred into pieces.   I use a paella pan on an outdoor grill.  After cooking the garlic, onion and bell peppers, I add the chicken and sausage and cook for a few minutes.  Then I add the rice and saffron.  I also add bijol to get a strong yellow color.  I let the rice cook for at least 5 minutes,  I then add a combination of beer and low sodium chicken stock.  I find this is more flavorful than using water.  I keep adding the liquids until the rice softens, which takes anywhere from 30-50 minutes. Always add seasoning when adding additional liquids.  
Once the rice softens, add the seafood and cook for about 5 minutes.  The rice should be yellow, flavorful and soft.

I serve this on the weekend because it does take a while, especially since I use Brown rice, but it's sooo worth it. It makes a big batch and feeds all four of us easily, despite the raging appetite of my nineteen year old son. It even leaves enough for a couple of lunches through the week. Yum!!

This dish was delicious! I didn’t have the saffron threads and it tasted just fine without it. Also, I only added a very little bit of lemon zest and it was perfect. The rice had a hint of lemon at the end and anymore than that would have ruined it. Takes a while to cook but worth it.

Phenomenal recipe, the rice was not too dry ( I used 4 cups of bone broth instead of the of chicken broth). Otherwise I made no changes and this had everyone grabbing seconds and a couple went for thirds. Will definitely be adding to my repertoire.

INGREDENTS MUST COOK TOGETHER IN OVEN TO BLEND FLAVORS - I ALSO ADD CLAM JUCE ALONG W/ THE CHICKEN OR SEAFOOD STOCK FOR ADDITIONAL GREAT FLAVOR
ALONG W/ CHICKEN,SHIMP I ADD SOME LARGE BAY SCALLOPS TOO. WE DON'T ADD CLAMS OR MUSSELS.
IF U CAN'T AFFORD SAFFRON-I CAN'T-  TRY USING TUMERIC- U STILL GET THE SAME  LOVELY COLOR
WISH THERE WAS A FLAVORFUL SUBSTITUTE FOR THOSE EXPENSIVE THREADS.
DOES ANYONE KNOW OF ONE? how 'bout u, CHEF JOHN!

Such a great and easy recipe.  I cooked the rice part in the  grill and covered with foil to finish , after  adding the meat portion  to it.  Ithe smoky taste of the paprika was  enhanced greatly.  Used  beef chorizo and it was amazing.

I’m an 11 yr old boy and I have a taste for Spanish food. I made this with my dad as an entry to basic cooking and a delicious dinner. I advise you to use “mega colossal” sized shrimp and my dad and I agree that you should lightly roast the saffron and use less lemon and parsley. It may very because do to my mom’s dietary restriction, we replaced chorizo with extra meats, salt and pepper, and smoked paprika to emulate traditional Pimentón de la Vera picante/dulce. This dish is also great for cats.

Easy paella. I substituted kielbasa for the chorizo sausage for a less greasy entree.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I would have probably liked it to be more spicy but my husband said he would not have wanted it to be any spicier. I will make again for a large group since it makes a lot!

We could not find Spanish chorizo, so used 6 ounces of Mexican instead and 2 pounds of shrimp instead of 1 pound and I was heavy handed with the saffron.  I felt that a pinch would not suffice.  
Never had paella from Spain, so I can honestly say that I don't know if this taste like paella.   But it was very good and even better the next day.

This was a tasty dish that had us reaching in for seconds.  After reading the reviews I cooked the chorizio then added to the pot, saving a little to sprinkle on top after. I let the shrimp cook on top of the dish and cooked the chicken in the oil left over from the chorizio.  I reserved a little of the chicken again to sprinkle on top but mixed the rest in with the dish. I added more stock as it was cooking.  I figured it worked out quite an expensive dish but then the yield gave enough for two meals, so not as bad as I origionally thought.

I didn't have the fresh parsley so I used dried instead and added a few frozen peas after everything was done. Next time, I think I will precook the chorizo to eliminate most of the fat.

I substituted tuna for the chicken and chorizo, and turmeric for the saffron - it worked well enough! This is a very straightforward recipe that works easily.

I used two small lemons and used the juice from one of those lemons in place of some of the lemon zest. I would make this again.

Loved it! My boyfriend was thrilled and wants it again all week. I’m curious to try scallops and shrimp instead of the other meats. I also was more generous (I added more like 3-4 pinches) with the saffron because I like spicy foods.

The paella I made tonight was an amalgam from several recipes here and elsewhere, so I'm not sure where to post it, but this one is the closest so here it goes. 
In any case I made paella today, for the first time in my life. My customer (wife) said it's the best dish I've ever made. I'm floating on a little cloud of happiness right now :). 
I won't elaborate all changes, but here are a few of the more salient ones:
1. I used three kinds of sweet peppers, sautied for an hour or so in garlic and onions as another rescipe suggested.
2. As suggested in the recipe by Chef John, I sautied the prawn shells and added the chicken stock and saffron. And btw I used real chicken bone stock that I'd made a few months ago and happenend to have in the freezer.
As has been noted saffron is expensive, but as luck would have it I was in Hungary visiting family in September and was able to get some for much less than it costs here. So I didn't skimp on the saffron :).

It turned out really good. If I make it again i would put the meat mixture in the larger pan and cook the rice in a pot or a smaller pan.  Two pounds of chicken plus sausage plus shrimp didn't fit very well in the small frying pan. I might also be tempted to combine them earlier to mix the flavours better.

I made it  as written and we loved it!   The chorizo is a ciritical ingredient.  It adds so much flavor.   For guests, I'll add some calamari and a few mussels and clams.

I've made this recipe numerous times for dinner parties and it's always a big hit. The only changes I made are that I made my own chorizo "sausage" out of ground turkey (because I don't eat mammals) and I used Basmati rice.  Great Recipe!

I followed the recipe but instead of 1 red bell pepper, I used 1/2 each of red, orange and yellow. This was my first time making paella and will definitely not be my last. My family loved it!

We made this but subbed the saffron with turmeric, which I had on hand.  It was delicious.  We found that there was too much meat for us, and will use less chorizo and chicken next time,but definitely a keeper.  Would make a great company dish.

Absolutely delicious! Modifications I made are:
1) using half chicken leg with skin and half chicken breast.
2) Frying up onions and chickens for 5 mins. Adding red pepper, chorizo, and shrimps. Set aside, THEN using the same pan, I cooked up the rice. I wanted to retain the flavours  of the onion, chicken and chorizo  in the pan.
3) After starting the rice cooking process with the chicken broth, I placed mussels and clams to steam until done and removed. This made it a bit messy because rice started submerging into the mussel/clam shells. Next time I'll cook the mussels/clams a little later when there's not so much liquid in the pan. 
4) 5 mins before the rice was done, I added the chicken, chorizo, and onion mixture (less shrimp) and mix into the rice to really get the chorizo and chicken flavours into the rice. 
5) I used arborio rice (used for Risotto) which made it too creamy for my dad although I liked it. I'll look for other rice types next time. 

Yumm! Will totally make again!

This is the best  paella  I've had since I was in Barcelona. It came out so great I can't even believe I made it. I did use smoked paprika and chicken thighs with no skin. I  just used chicken and a couple of shrimp, no sausage. I feel the sausage can make it a little greasy. I used a heavy  stainless steel pot  because I did not have a paella pan.  At the end of cooking the rice I put the heat real high to get the crispy bottom. I read that is very authentic.  I also added lots of peas for color and texture to the chicken and shrimp at the end.

It all worked like a dream. 
I cannot wait to make this again. It was fantastic!

I like the taste of this recipe when it was complete and it tasted very good for days after. We shared it with friends as a left over and they loved it. But, I thought it strange that the meat and rice cooked separately. I will try the Paella I recipe next time. Also, I added about 1 lb of mussels to the meat mixture, and used skin-on legs and thighs for the chicken. They cooked in a wok with sliced chorizo (deli style) and they came out great.

Paella is always better when the meats are baked with the rice. The flavor of the meats would have been enhanced had they been cooked together which i did, i just should have used less stock.

Used this method but swapped chicken & chorizo for shrimp, scallops, mussels & lobster. It was amazing! Had to add more chicken stock to maintain moisture level.

It was very good! It made a lot of food, and it will definitely be my meal of the week. My local market didn't have saffron so I used extra smoked paprika and some turmeric and it turned out great! I also added some mushrooms and extra bell pepper. I really like this recipe!

This was a huge hit with my family.  It is delicious and easy to make.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika,  1 tbsp of garlic infused olive oil instead of regular olive oil and omitted the crushed garlic. I also omitted the red pepper flakes as my chorizo was spicy enough.  I added 1 can of crushed fire roasted tomatoes to the rice in the last five minutes of cooking to give it more moisture and also added a pinch of turmeric.

I didn't have red pepper flakes so I used a little Cayenne instead.  Other than that, I followed the recipe fairly closely and it turned out great!

I followed this recipe completely and for a first timer at making Paella I was very pleased. Next time I may augment a little. The zested lemon added a fresh flavor. Next, I would try to get the flavors to meld together better. Overall, I followed the recipe and the result was delicious!

I would make this again but I would do it a bit different, I would get chorizo sausage that has the casing on it like you would find in gumbo, and use less onion cause me or my daughter don't like onion and use more peppers and maybe more shrimp and chicken, but I think it was a hit, my husband says I can make it again!! I loved the spicy kick it had to it too!!!

Very good! I've made paella before and on this recipe I changed a few things. I don't like chorizo so I used sausage, no oregano my husband does not like oregano. I fried my chicken and used very little red pepper flakes.  I added a small bag of mixed seafood along with shrimp, scallops and mussels.  I have  all my ingredients lined up so when I fry my rice until it is opaque 2 cups, with 4 cups of chicken broth once I get it bubbly I add the chicken, sausage and seafood cover it with foil paper stick it in the oven 350 degrees ( I have a paella dish) about 40 minutes, keep an eye on it once the water evaporates.  When you make paella you can add, delete just make it your own.  A very good Sunday dish that the whole family can enjoy.  If you find that your rice is still a little hard add a little water and stick it back in the oven always keep an eye on it.  Enjoy!

Came out so much better than I have expected. I didn't have short grain rice so I used Basmati. I added some chopped green onions on the meat and seafood mix 1 minute before Its done.

I made a couple of changes but overall this was really good! 

I'm not great at cooking rice, so I cooked the rice in a rice cooker. I added chicken broth and seasoned (with seasoning listed in recipe minus the lemon) added a packet of Sazon, let cook and sat aside. I also added a bit more broth than needed  to make sure rice was moist.

I cooked each of the ingredients separately and set to the side in a large bowl.

First the vegetables (1 large Sweet Onion, 1 large Green Pepper and 1 Large  Red Pepper).

Then I cooked the Shrimp until almost done. Then the Chorizo  and finally the Chicken ( I seasoned each to taste).

I then added fresh garlic to the pan,  cooked for about 1 minute and added in the rice. I then added a can of diced tomatoes (flavored with garlic, oregano and basil, I also drained the can prior to added to rice) and mixed and let simmer for about 5 minutes. I then added all of the bowl ingredients( Vegetables, Chicken, Shrimp and Chorizo) and mixed with rice ( add more chicken broth if needed), added two more packets of Sazon and simmered on medium high to high for about 10-15 minutes to blend the flavors. 

It came out really well and there was a layer of nice brown rice on the bottom of the pan that really soaked up all the flavors.

I would suggest that others season as they see fit , as I added a bit more seasoning than called for in the recipe which to me ( and family) tasted great!

Easy- yes it was and worthy of being served in a restaurant. I cut back the Chorizo to 1/2 lb and after watching the video, I substituted chicken thighs instead of breast meat. I used smoked Paprika and it sure had a distinct taste. Altho I didn't use Saffron spice, I felt recipe turned out just as well.
This recipe will go into my all-time favorites!!

Fabulous!  I substituted a 1 1/2 cup package of saffron rice for the short grain white rice and the saffron threads.  Also, cut the lemon zest in half.  Very quick and easy...and all done on the stove top.  Tasted like we were back in Spain!

This is a great recipe.  I would suggest adding 2 cans of diced tomatoes to the meat dish portion.  Consider reducing the chicken stock by 1/2, also add 1 full  bellpepper to the rice as well as the meat portion.  The recipe is excellent, just really good.  I compared to a LeCreuset recipe.  Trust me this one is better in every way.

I've never had chorizo before, but love sausage and the Mexican food I have had here in San Diego. So I wanted to give this a try. I'm not sure if I bought the wrong brand (i got the pricier one at the grocery) or if all chorizo is a similarly slimy yet grity load of spices that doesnt Resemble meat at all. Flavors of Chirizo and the rice where overwhelming and didn't seem like flavors that should be mixed together. This dish was particularly disapointing because of the cost of the ingredients that go into it. Never again

We loved it! Gobbled up every single bite!
This was the first recipe I found for Paella that looked simple (it was) and tasty (ditto).
I didn't have access to Spanish chorizo so we substituted Johnsonville andouille sausage, chopped into small pieces. REMEMBER... Spanish chorizo is not really interchangeable with Mexican chorizo. The recipe doesn't specify, but you want/need Spanish chorizo or a similar sausage for paella.

The lemon zest was too much -- the rice came out a little bitter. (I used the 4 portion version, which requires 1 lemon)

This was phenomenal!  I took some of the suggestions from here and drained the chorizo before putting it in with the rest of the rice, etc.  I also put a box of mussels in that I think had some garlic butter sauce in the package with them, but it surely did not detract from the dish - infact, it may have added something. I forgot to put the peppers and the peas in but the dish was still fantastic, and I'm not sure if I would put the peas in the next time around.  I also might roast the peppers before putting them in!  Long story short - so delicious, minimal alterations (but with room for a lot of variety), definitely going on our "favorites" list!

I only used 1/2 TBSP of paprika.  My family doesn't like food as hot so I used 1/2 TSP of red pepper flakes instead of 1 TSP.  Also, I only cooked the rice for 15 minutes instead of 20.  Last time I made this and cooked for 20 minutes, it was overcooked.

Yes I'll make it again!  Reduced the recipe down to four servings and I don't eat meat so used 1lb shrimp. Marinated the shrimp instead everything else according to the recipe.  Very good nice blend of flavors.

What I finally wound up with was delicious, but every pot, pan, and surface in my kitchen was dirty, and in the end, I had to ditch the recipe and do things my own way to get the flavors to meld.

Wonderful. A lot of pans, a lot of work, and a lot of food but the flavor and variety of this dish cannot be beat.

Used Arborio rice, smoked chicken andouille, shrimp, squid and mussels. Only cooked for about 30 mins and it was great for me.

I just got back from Spain where we ate LOTS of different paellas. this recipe was very disappointing to me so much so that I couldn't even call this dish paella. I would call it a very good  meat and rice dish... NOT paella. Paella was more saucey, more of a full dish. Very good flavor overall though just not what I was looking for.

I was so excited to try this recipe but it really was just ok.  The rice was still hard.  It really needed another quart of liquid.  I would still that in letting it absorb and then when it was about dry add the final quart then cover and simmer for the final 20 minutes. The flavor of the meat seems to be missing something too. I may play with the combinations, or I may not.

It was amazing. I did a pound of chicken, 1/2 pound of smoked sausage, and a 1/2 pound of shrimp. I used 5 cloves of garlic and added some peas. Also substituted yellow saffron rice and used tumeric instead of saffron to save some $$. I didn't use the chicken broth. HUGE hit! Definitely going to make it again

Outstanding!! I was very impressed with this recipe. I am from Central Florida and we have a wonderful restaurant called The Columbia that specializes in Spanish cuisine. This recipe was like something right off their menu. Wonderful combination of flavors! I will make this again and again!

For an everyday paella this is a good recipe. For a special occasion, I would add mussels. However, I agree with those who criticize the process. Using all the ingredients listed, I enhance it by sautéing (one at a time) the chorizo, chicken, and shrimp, removing them to a bowl. Then I sauté the aromatics and rice in the accumulated juices and cook it as directed. When the rice is done, I mix the meat in.  The flavors meld as I warm the meat.  Excellent and I only use one pan!

I would suggest to cover the rice while cooking to make sure the top parts are cooked thru. I would add some peas too if available. But overall a good, spicy and easy dish to make.

I just tried this and basically it was good but I think the Chorizo spice overpowered the normally delicate taste of the Paella.  Another sausage that did not have the spice on the outside or perhaps Chorizo left in the casing might be better.  Likely I would not use Chorizo next time.

I tried this last night and it came out really good. I left out the lemon zest, chorizo, bell pepper, flat leaf parsley, and saffron and instead used Pace picante sauce, smoked sausage, dried parsley, and tumeric. Next time I may leave out the red pepper flakes as this was a little bit spicy for my wife and I.

A bit too greasy for my liking.  The chorizo really needs to be cut in half and drained.  But other than that it was good!

It's a great base to start with. I had leftover chicken breasts seasoned with trader joe's salute seasoning and leftover zucchini. I omitted the lemon zest and red pepper. I didn't use paprika since I didn't have any. I followed the recipe with the above modifications since I was in the mood for paella but didn't want too much work and steps. I did add a can of diced chillies with tomatoes and as per another reviewer added 2 packages of sazon with saffron in addition to what the recipe calls for. Excellent dish-my husband and son and especially I loved it.

My grocery store didn't have saffron so I substituted turmeric. They also didn't have chorizo sausage so I used chourico (Portuguese).This was absolutely delicious!! The presentation on the platter was very attractive, but I think I might add some more color- peas? olives? You could also add mussels, clams or lobster claws.

I can't say it is amazing, it is good though. I didn't change much, I only removed the sausage. Put less chicken and shrimp and added the lemon juice of the lemon I zested. It felt like it could use some lemony taste. It looks very fancy!

Excellent dish for starters like me... I always wants to make Paella but thinking I would ruin the seafood (and is sooo expensensive this days) I never try it. I follow AngelaSpencer suggestion about the saffron the little bottle is 17.00 VS. .79 cents the mexican safflower... and the dish was awesome.

I used freshly made chorizo which made the dish very spicy.  It was very good but way too much for me.  I left out Saffron as I didn't have any.  This dish really makes a lot too!

Pretty good.  Only used the chicken & sausage, no shrimp.  Also forgot the artichokes, so tough to say what it would have been like.  Requires a bit of prep to have the meat and rice cook at the same time.

Excellent tasting and seriously easy.  I added some slices of basa fillets and it went nicely together with the other ingredients.  I didn't marinade the chicken overnight and it was still delicious.  Added basil too as another seasoning.

Very good! But very spicy! As recommended by the other reviews, I cut the red pepper flakes in half. Still, it was quite spicy, but perfect for me. I served it with a simple romaine salad with some black pepper on it. Very delicious, flavorful dinner.

We made this recipe after eating paella at a restaurant in New York state.

Not sure if this is authentic or not, but it was very good! We stuck to recipe as exactly as the recipe details.

This recipe was a HUGE HUGE HUGE hit with my family.  Using fresh lemon and fresh parsley is a must...as well as using Spanish rice.  What a difference this makes.  So happy I found this recipe.

I didn't give it 5 stars because it really isn't a proper paella. However, I must admit it was very nice! The flavour was great, it was easy to make and it was a hit even with my 18-month old son!
I'd definitely recommed it but if it is authentic paella you're after, keep on looking!

I really enjoyed this paella and especially appreciated how well the recipe is written.  

I usually rush through recipes because there is so much measuring and chopping involved, but I was easily able to keep up the pace and move between steps without overcooking anything.

Also, I loved the suggestion to rub the saffron threads with a little salt. It made the saffron spread a lot more easily.

It was quick and easy.  The next time I make it, I will use 1/2 tsp. of pepper flakes as oppose to the 1 tsp. recommended.  Will make again for sure.

This was really good! My husband and I couldn't get enough of it! The kids enjoyed this dish as well. I followed the recipe exactly except I skipped the lemon zest (didn't have any) and used green instead of red bell pepper because that is what I had on hand. Would definitely make this again, perhaps experimenting more next time.

I thought this was just ok.  My husband hated it, but he's not a big fan of shrimp.  I picked his out, but it still had the shrimp flavor.  It probably would have been better without the lemon and it also needed more chicken stock for the rice to cook thoroughly.  This recipe has  many great reviews, so maybe paella is  not for us.  :0)

Considering I didn't even have a paella pan... this turned out really well! That little bit of lemon zest made a big difference and gave a nice kick of flavor to it.  Will make again!

My husband loved this dish.  I looked at some of the other reviews, and here are some of the different things i added.  First, I added garlic and only used chicken broth versus water.  This was easy, and there was enough for lunch the next day.  Got to love left overs!!!!

Excellent recipe!  I added clams & mussels to this dish!  I recommend more chicken stock that what's called for.  I used more and the rice was nice and moist.  Will definitely make this again!!!

5 stars to the saffron rice! being vegetarians, i tried making a veggie mix to put on top of this rice recipe, loosely following recipe for spicing mainly. rice was amazing, veggies needed a bit of work (overcooked while trying to spice). the veggies just didn't live up to the rice. i will definately make rice again, even though saffron is expensive!

Having spent some years living in Panama, I am always excited to have paella.  I was concerned about this recipe when I read it because it seemed very meat heavy.  Sure enough, for me there was entirely too much meat, not enough rice and unfortunately the shrimp I used wasn't the best, which didn't help.  I think this recipe may be redeemable though if proportions can just be changed.  I will make again with some more shrimp, and will cut out the chicken completely.  Will re-review when I do as well.

I can't say I really enjoyed this dish. It was rather odd. Maybe it ws the saffron, I am not sure, but I think this wasn't as flavorful as I would have hoped for.

Once you get all the ingredients prepped, this is rather easy to cook.  It also makes a LOT of food.  Bring a friend or three.  Definitely worth the effort though.  Fantastic!!

Unlike other paellas this is really easy.  I also used the saffron rice and added a little extra saffron and cumin.  I also added about 1/4 cup of chicken stock to the meat/seafood/veggy mixture.  Instead of shrimp I used scallops.  Thanks for the recipe my guest loved it!

This may not be "authentic", but my whole family loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I am lucky enough that I live in an area where the Basque population is high so I was able to use authentic chorizo made by a local distributor.  This dish is definetly company-worthy.

This was good stuff.  It may not be authentic paella, but it is delicious.  It makes a lot, and I had to use two skillets since the meat and peppers and onions wouldn't all fit in one.

A good alternative to a paella. This dish looked pretty and it tasted good. The chorizo is what gives it the most flavor. I would cut the chicken smaller than 2 inches next time. I think it was lacking flavor overall, but I did like it anyways.

Yummy!  We, like others, used packaged saffron rice and left out the bay leaf (on accident).  It was wonderful.  We also didn't have any Italian parsley or onion so we used dried parsley and minced onion.

Wow.  Unbelievable.  So easy and so good.  I used fresh oregano (3x the amount dried), used smoked beef sausage cut into small pieces, and omitted the shrimp (although next time I will try shrimp too), and my husband and I couldn't believe how flavorful this was!  Everything about it was just right..  Mmmmm......

This is a great tasting summer dish.  It doesn't give you a lot of time to step away from the kitchen, but if you can afford the time it takes to make this meal you will enjoy an authentic taste of the south of Europe.

Made this tonight and it was very good and easy to make. I was half through the recipe when DUH! I remembered I didn't have any saffron! I just added more red pepper flake and it tasted just as good.
