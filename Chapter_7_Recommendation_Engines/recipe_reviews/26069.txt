I really am shocked that such a simple recipe is so awesome!  For those who had dry chicken, you must have used too large of a pan.  This is really fabulous -- even for the non-caper lovers.  If you take the time to read the reviews you have to try this!!!! Thanks for the post!

Delicious!!! Used A1, but reduced by half due to some comments I read about the A1 overpowering everything.  Added some flour to thicken sauce.  Will add even more flour next time, and stick with the A1 amount.  A fantastic dish if you like capers!  Will make again!

I was skeptical of the steak sauce, but no one could guess the ingredients at my house. Only changes I made were to slice the chicken breasts lengthwise (kind of like a scallopini) and then saute in 1/2 of the butter for a little color. Added the rest of the ingredients per the recipe and baked for 20 minutes at 350. Scrumptious and really pretty.

A keeper!  My husband and parents loved it.  It was quick, easy and yummy!  My husband was trying to guess the ingredients (he got capers and lemon juice), but he didn't guess steak sauce!  I was afraid it would be too steak-saucy, but it wasn't at all.  (I used Lawry's Steak Sauce.)

Very easy to make and tasty. I did double the sauce but it seemed to make a whole LOT of it so I'm not sure doubling was necessary. Other than doubling the sauce, I made it just as written. My only complaint is that the sauce is a little thin so next time, I'll thicken it up with cornstarch before serving. And I'll add more capers (my own personal preference).

Dry, dry, dry!!!  Flavor was OK, but that didn't make a difference given how bone-dry it turned out. Maybe it was because I baked it in a Pyrex dish and not a clay pot...?

This is really good.  Very simple to make on a busy night.  We love capers so added extra.  I added this recipe to my personal cookbook.  If you like capers there is another recipe for fish on this site called "Tilapia with White Wine Caper Sauce". It is very simple to.

An interesting twist on what is normally just a boring baked chicken breast. I thought maybe the steak sauce might make this too boldly flavored but that surprisingly wasn't the case at all.  Attractive golden brown, mildly but nicely flavored.

Pretty darn yum!  I did not have steak sauce so I mixed catsup, Worcestershire sauce, and bit of brown sugar instead and it was amazing! Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this for dinner for the 1st time.  I used slightly less A1 Steak Sauce than called for.  I also sliced a small to medium size red onion and placed the chicken over it, this made a nice addition to the meal.  As another reviewer suggested I halved the chicken breasts and sauteed them to just brown the outside a little.  I LOVE capers so I probably more than doubled that part.  Next time I will use less butter - at least 1/2 of what is called for.  I had also just made another recipe and had just a little bit of chicken broth left so I added that to the pyrex pan as well.  I do not have a clay pot, the pyrex covered with foil worked just fine, the chicken was perfect, not dry at all. I enjoyed this dish, it was quick, easy and all ingredients are in the house already.  I will make again, Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good!  I changed it up a bit....used olive oil instead of butter, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, cut the steak sauce in half (A1) & marinated them in the sauce prior to browning in the skillet.  They were moist & tasty.  Next time I will add more capers.

Very good!  I used A-1, and with the capers had just enough kick.  I did not have a clay pot, but this cooked up nice and juicy!

This is delicious as written. I butterflied a whole chicken by removing the backbone and flattening in in a roasting pan. And doubled the sauce amount. It was great. Nice company recipe.

This recipe is outstanding!  From previous reviews I did go easy on the A1 and I added a few more capers just for personal taste.   I would also recommend marinating the chicken in the mixture for at least an hour.  Very flavorful!

Easy, but sophisticated enough to serve to guests.  Cornstarch works wonders at thickening the sauce.  I'd double it if I wanted to use it liberally or use it to accent a side dish.

Yum yum.  I followed the recipe except I used a lime instead of lemon and used a cast iron dutch oven instead of clay pot.  Chicken was tender, juicy, and tangy. Huge hit at our house.  Delish:)

This was very good.  I sliced the chicken open and poured most of the sauce and capers on the inside of the chicken, reserving 1-2T of sauce to drizzle over the tops once I'd folded them closed.  Then a sprinkling of shredded parmesan, which made a nice thin crust on the top.  Putting some sauce inside kept the chicken nice and moist, and very flavorful.  I will make this again!

I made this with chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts - hold out the butter if you do the same! There's plenty of fat in the broth after cooking it.

We all thought this was a wonderful recipe, Shannon. I dredged my chicken into seasoned flour and browned in a skillet and opted to use Heinz 57 instead of the steak sauce. I covered my casserole dish and the chicken came out very moist and tender. So delicious and thank you, Shannon!

It was great!  25 minutes left my chicken pink in the middle, I had to go a total of 45, but it was well worth the wait. I made it with Jack Daniel's Steak Sauce, and in a pyrex 8 x 8, and had no problems, chicken was very moist.

VERY good! I agree on adding capers as that's our preference too. Serve the sauce over mashed potatoes and the thinness is PERFECT!

Edible. I premade the sauce and since I found it a bit over powering and salty, I decided to pan fry the chicken and then deglazed the pan with white wine to help dilute it a bit. I didn't like the caper brine, so I didn't add that to the sauce. Probably won't be making this again.

I just didn't care for the flavor of this. I like capers, so maybe it was the steak sauce (I used A-1). Too watery as well.

This was excellent! So easy. Instead of pepper, I seasoned with lemon pepper seasoning. I also thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.

This was fabulous!  I didn't change a thing.  I wasn't sure about the steak sauce but it was fabulous!  The chicken was very tender and flavorful.  I served it with wild rice and mixed veggies.

I really like this dish.  I did use less lemon bc bf is not a fan of meat with lemon, but kept the rest the same.  He doesn't like capers, either, but I think the flavor is mild enough he'll be fine.  I had mine with rice, and it was a very nice, filling dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used chicken legs as that's all I had in the fridge, and I followed the suggestion to use 1/8 C of steak sauce.  I also added some artichoke hearts the last 10 minutes of baking.  My family LOVED this dish!

This was surprising delicious and simple to make. I used Worchester sauce in place of the steak sauce. Someone mentioned that theirs turned out dry. I found keeping it covered kept it moist.

We are huge caper lovers and this receipe was delicious. I had not used my clay pot for awhile and forgot how tender meats come out of them. Will use this receipe many times more.

I thought this was pretty good. I have to say, I think I prefer the more standard lemon-garlic-butter-caper sauce, but this was an interesting variation. I'll make it again, I'm sure, though I think next time I will leave out the caper brine. Bonus points for being SO EASY - that was great.

Really good and easy.  With no steak sauce on hand, I substituted Bragg Liquid Aminos and it was great!  Because we love capers, I added extra.  Served with brown rice and veggies. Delicious!

I have to agree with a previous reviewer. I followed the instructions exactly and the chicken was very dry. The only thing I could taste was the steak sauce which was also disappointing.

Used A-1 and needed to cook for 40 minutes (at 425).  VERY moist and tender chicken.  Strong flavours with none being predominant.  Didn't have much sauce for dribbling (over a starch sidedish) but the flavours are so bold that you probably wouldn't want to ;^)

I ended up straying away from the original recipe since I didn't have all ing. on hand.  I subbed hot sauce for the steak sauce and it turned out very good.  I do plan on trying it with the steak sauce and also giving it a go with Heinz 57 sauce.

I used A1 steak sauce and followed the recipe as written.  I was thinking that the three main flavors of the A1, the lemon and the capers would all blend together and each would be lost in the steak sauce.  But I was pleasantly surprised that each of the flavors stood out well on their own.  And it obviously lends it self to some fun experimentation using different steak sauces.  It was very very good.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing. I'll be sharing it with my friends at Our Table Talk dot com

Really loved this recipe!!! Once I'd figured out that Chef brown sauce is the Irish equivilent of steak sauce I was *dying* to make this!! Thought the lemon juice with the caper juice might make it tart, but no! So so so tasty!! :-)

This recipe is AWESOME if you like capers. I followed the recipe, except that I didn't have steak sauce on hand so I used Warcesteshire (sp?) sauce instead. It tasted great, but was a little too runny for serving as a sauce over the chicken. I will thicken it after baking next time.

I loved the flavor, but the sauce was thin and I ended up with chicken floating in a pan of flavorful buttery sauce, so next time I think I'll cook my rice right there in the pan to saok up all the yumminess!

My husband doesn't like capers so I reserved the capers until after the chicken was cooked but I still used the juices and everyone loved it!  The chicken was really juicy & flavorful.  The family rated it 5 stars.

We loved the sauce!  I added a touch of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce while still cooking and served it with mashed potatoes.   Mushrooms would add a yummy twist as well.

Tara gave this 4 stars and Al gave it 3.  I think next time I will try it with a "less bold" steak sauce. I used A-1 this time which is very bold in flavor. I think a more mild steaksauce will make this better.

This was quite different, but very yummy !  I was a bit skeptical about the steak sauce, but it was great - if you like capers, this is a winner ! I used chicken thighs as that is what I had available - hubby also liked it quite well !

This is a very good recipe! I made it according to the instructions and the flavor was delightful and different from any other chicken dish I've ever made. Hubby loved it and said it was a keeper. The only change I will make next time is that I'll bake the chicken for longer than the allotted time of 25 minutes. I actually did add an additional 5 minutes to the time but I think that baking it longer will make the chicken even more tender.  Also, there was plenty of liquid in the baking dish to use as a thin sauce to serve over the chicken and the rice I made to accompany it.  Thanks for this very interesting and enjoyable recipe!

I realy liked this dish!  My chicken was very moist!  I did not bake it at 425 as suggested I baked my chicked at 400 between 45 min and an hour.  I poured the sauce that it made over the chicken when served.  We slopped up the extra juice with some crusty bread, it was very yummy!! :)

This was very good.  I plan to add a little cornstarch at the end of cooking to thicken the sauce.

My boyfriend and I thought this was really good.  It was a real flavor burst, very zesty, which we like.  It was very simple and mine turned out just perfect in a pyrex dish covered in tin foil, though it did take more like 45 minutes to an hour to cook, even having defrosted my chicken beforehand.  I took the suggestions of doubling the sauce for the rice, adding a tbsp of flour to thicken the sauce, and using slightly less A1 than called for.  In the end I probably added a touch too much caper juice, and would be more careful of that next time because it was quite salty.

This was excellent!  I may have had a little too much lemon juice---the lemon I used was large and yielded about 1/4 cup of juice----I think I will cut back on that a little next time (it was a bit tart).  Like others, I reduced the A-1 by half.  I also sliced a large onion and put in the bottom of the dish---I used a covered pyrex dish which I covered with foil before placing the lid on.  Chicken was very moist and flavorful!  A keeper and easy to boot!

This was so easy that my 4 year old practically did this on her own.  Very good and we used regular worcestershire sauce in the exact amount and it didn't over power it like some other reviewers described.  Will make again.

This chicken was VERY good! I added some artichokes and mushrooms to the pan and served with a baked potato. I used a small stone bar pan and covered with aluminum foil to bake. Turned out very juicy and delicious. I love the flavor of steak sauce, but next time I would probably use half the amount just because the flavor is so overwhelming. Great, simple recipe - and a great way to use up that jar of capers I had in the fridge!

When I read "steak sauce" in this recipe I didn't think it was a great idea, and it wasn't.  Meat flavor with chicken!  Maybe Chicken Worcestershire would be better.

I didn't measure anything.. just kinda threw the amounts that looked good to me and it was verrry yummy. :o)  My guess is I used more butter and lemon juice than called for and merely seasoned it with A1 just to give it a lil extra kick.  Came out great!  The chicken was moist and the capers were perfect!  Some mashed potatoes on the side and dinner was set and everyone was happy :D

Not too shabby! I'm happy to find another way to use capers that my kids can enjoy.    We did this stovetop instead (a bit pinched for time) and it still turned out great.   We made sure it was covered, and added a touch more liquid than called for, and it cut the cooking time quite a bit.    I also diced the capers to distribute the flavor a little more, and added a bit of seasoning salt.  We did thicken the liquid with a little flour in the end, just a touch, only because we were eating it with mashed potatoes. Otherwise we would have left it.  It's a winner, we'll make this again for sure.

I will try this again.  I will cut back on the lemon and search for a herb to balance the citrus and caper flavors.  I usually go to garlic, but that would be too heavy for this dish.  My husband doesn't like capers (I love them)and he didn't mind the flavors saying I could make the dish again.  I loved the tenderness of the chicken and the short cook time.  I will adapt other recipes to the 400 degree/covered rule.  You cannot sub Worcester Sauce for the Steak sauce - The complex flavors of the Sauce work beautifully with the butter and caper juice. I will try it again.

Not bad, but not something I'll be making again soon. I wasn't a big fan of the lemon and steak sauce combo- but perhaps because I used Worcestershire sauce- it was all I had on hand. I also thought it was too lemony (and I usually love lemon dishes). Next time I'll try a different steak sauce and less lemon juice... But, on another note, the chicken came out perfect in a Pyrex dish, not dry at all- the trick is to make sure you cover it with foil.

I made two chicken breasts with the sauce indicated for four in this recipe. I put them in the smallest dish I could find that would fit the chicken and the sauce. It was SO moist and delicious and I thought the balance of flavors was perfect.

Wonderful recipe.  I was a little hesitant because my husband is not a huge caper fan, but he loved it.  As suggested by others I used less steak sauce because all I could easily find was A1--but to make sure there was enough liquid I substituted some chicken broth for the steak sauce I took out.  It worked out well.  I also put the chicken on a bed of sliced onions since my husband is a huge fan of onions and they were delicious too.  Definitely will make again.

This was a simple and easy dish but for us was good not GREAT. The steak sauce was a bit overpowering for us but not terrible. This wouldn't be something we would crave but might make again if short on time!

AMAZING!!! I'm always searching for new chicken dishes and they always end up tasting the same. But this one is hearty and interesting. My husband LOVED it, and usually isn't a fan of my "chicken pasta surprise" meals. Becareful of the A1 sauce...it can really overwhelm. I add in a few tablespoons of flour at the beginning to thicken the sauce and have cut the A1 to about 1 T, but that's for 2 chicken breasts. But overall it's been one of our favorites so far. Worth a try!

Good recipe... different but good.  I'm not 100% sold on the steak sauce, but the flavor base is there - bold and strong.  It's something to work on.

Nice tangy flavor and very easy to make. I used Lea and Perrin's steak sauce which was perfect for this dish. I cut back on the butter a bit and eyeballed the capers and caper juice. (2 tbsp might be a bit much on both.) A great recipe. Will make again.

This was certainly easy...If you love capers you will enjoy this.  Don't know if it is my favorite.  I used A-1 steak sauce and it was the predominate flavor that you tasted.  I had to cook it for 35 minutes because my chicken was still pink after 25.  I think this may taste better with a tomoatoe based steak sauce like Hienze 57.  What did the rest of these folks use?  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was pretty yummy!  I substituted hoisin sauce for 1/2 the steak sauce and served over whole grain rice...w/the sauce poured over all.

Wow! For something so incredibly simple the flavor was delicious!! Baked it at 350(covered) for a half hour, added thickened corn starch and turned the heat up to 425 and baked it at 425 for another 10 months mutes. Tender, juicy and delicious. Will definitely make this again!!

Made it for my wife and I so cut backed on the amounts.  Two large breast from Costco which I sliced into thinner pieces.  Had enough for two meals. Combined it with the rice pineapple recipe from the Caribbean Chicken with Pineapple-Cilantro rice  recipe.  Will do again for guest the next time.

A great dish that all the family loved.  Chicken was moist and succulent and plenty of sauce to accompany it.  Served dish with rice pilaf as suggested.  Really wonderful new dinner for us. NB  After reading reviews I decided to half steak sauce but next time I would definitely use amount in recipe.

I  made this exactly as stated in the recipe, including the clay pot, and didn't care for it. The sauce just tastes like steak sauce which is weird with chicken. The chicken was dry. It was edible, but I won't make it again.

I made this in a glass baking dish and although great flavor, was dry inside but used the wonderful sauce to moisten it.  Will try a clay pot next time!  Yummy leftovers too.

This was super easy, yet very tasty!  I followed the recipe for the most part, except I did double the sauce and I seasoned my chicken before cooking.  This was my first time skeptical g at such a high temperature, but I’m going to do it again.  My chicken was moist .  I had leftover chicken so I wiped off the capers, shredded it, and used it to make chicken nachos.   This recipe is going to be used again!

Very tasty. I followed recipe but cooked at 425 degrees for 45 minutes. Next time I will cut the breasts into quarters as they'll be more easy to use for leftovers. I will also sprinkle garlic powder along with the pepper. I used the leftovers cut up in cubes and warmed with some salsa for  chicken tacos. I might make chicken pot pie with them the next time.
In other words, you have a great first meal with the carb of your choice and if you have leftovers you have seasoned chicken to use in many choices of recipes.

This recipe makes a nice sauce, which surprised me a bit because of the steak sauce.  I added some artichoke hearts thawed from frozen.  The only objection my family and I had was with the size of the chicken breasts.  The ones I used were just too large, but it isn't easy to find smaller chicken breasts where I shop.  In the future I will cut the breasts in half horizontally.  That way they will take on more flavor and won't make for such a large serving.  Otherwise, I would definitely make this again.  I served the chicken with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.  Since I didn't have a clay pot, I used a Le Creuset pot, which seemed to work fine.

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought it was rather lackluster.    I guess my expectation for the flavor to be absorbed into the chicken was unrealistic.    The idea was good, the ingredients were good but I just felt it was rather meh.

This was such a simple recipe but the problem I had was it was  too dry.  I slow cooked it on 325 for an 1.5 thinking it would make it tender but it did not.   I had an idea to try next time would maybe soak the breast in milk or another tenderizing agent.   I did not use a clay pot just a regular pyrex but I don't think that was the problem.

This is my new favorite !!  I did add just a small amount of sugar to offset the "bite" of  caper liquid & steak sauce.  My husband
isn't big on "change" but he did say he would like this again! 
I served it over rice & combination of blanched asparagas, green beans & snap peas.

Easy and delicious! I used chicken tenders, added much more caper juice and a lot of capers and tiny red peppers from Wegmans Olive bar- 1/2 cup, and lemon juice and melted butter.
Season  with dill weed , garlic powder, lemon pepper seasoning, and Jane's crazy mixed up seasoning and marinade overnight.
Heated everything the next day and thickened the sauce with corn starch to a good consistency.  Baked covered for about 40-50 minutes at 350 degrees

This turned out fantastic. Based on other reviewers’ comments, I doubled everything but the chicken. The consistency was thin but very juicy and delicious. I think thickening the sauce would have taken the exciting flavor away. Made a great leftover meal the next day too. THANK YOU kindly Shannon!

Made this just as stated except for a teaspoon of garlic.  Thought it needed some salt but I was afraid to add much because I don't use steak sauce and didn't know if it would be salty.  I even used a clay pot.  I prefer my own caper chicken on the stove top.  And by the way you DO NOT preheat the oven using a clay pot. It always goes into a cold oven. I used A1 maybe a different steak sauce would be better.

This was delicious.  I used about 3 T. Heinz 57 sauce and only 1 T. butter.  I had 2 larger chicken breasts so sliced each in half horizontally.  We had never eaten capers before.  They added a really nice flavor.

Great, easy recipe!  I used Lea and Perins steak sauce as I thought A1 would be too overpowering.  I used one tablespoon of the caper brine instead of two.  It turned out perfectly.  I think it would be good with a pork tenderloin as well.  A definite keeper!

Made this 2 nights in a row because it was such a hit, Used my Emile Henry tagine which worked perfectly. I added the zest from the lemon to the sauce, didn't have A1 so substituted with 50/50 HP and Diana Chicken and Rib sauce; and used the whole 4oz of capers ( we love capers). Served with lemon rice pilaf that had carrots and asparagus added.

The caper and lemon sauce was delicious, but I would sauté the chicken breasts in a little butter and pepper rather than baking them, which made them a little tough and fibrous. After sautéing the breasts I would put them in the warmer, and deglaze the pan with the lemon juice, butter, steak sauce and caper mix and pour the hot sauce over them. I might even put a little flour in the pan with some hot butter and use that to thicken the sauce a bit. But the flavor was excellent, so try it!

This is a keeper.  We didn't have 'steak sauce' so fumbled our way through it. Cooked in a cast iron in the oven, but it took longer than 25 minutes due to variables such as.. breasts were 
huge and cast iron skillet went in at room temp.  Recipe is 
fantastic as is.

Made this last PM for dinner; was jazzed about the combo of butter, capers and lemon (sounds like a picatta sauce, doesn't it? YUM! I love the flavor of lemon+butter!) but the steak sauce adds such a dominant flavor, I could probably have ended up with approximately the flavors  if I'd simply doused the chicken steak sauce!  

One thing I did do to avoid a dry result and to give us something to flavor our side of rice, was to double the "sauce" ingredients.  If I made this recipe again, I'd probably double the sauce again....but honestly, I probably won't make this one again.

I made this for my family of 5 for dinner tonight and doubled the recipe.  While the chicken was very moist, we did NOT like the sauce.  We love lemon and butter as well as capers.  I think it was the A1 steak sauce that we found offensive.  The sauce was weirdly tangy.  It tasted unusual and sour.  I will not make this again.  There are lots of leftovers that I will try to wash the sauce of the chicken and dice it for salads.

This was an amazing, QUICK dinner!  My five year old and seven year old LOVED it - and I was worried about the capers! ;)  Hubby is a huge fan of capers, so I tried it!  Will DEFINITELY be making again.  I know it said a clay pot was preferable, but, honestly, I used a shallow glass baking pan and it was still wonderful - juicy, flavorful, etc.  I did follow the directions to a T!  I hate tweaking before trying a recipe as is!  Thank you!

So delish and so easy to make.  Chicken was moist and the sauce was lemony but not overpowering. I added a tablespoon of gluten free flour to the sauce and it came out with just the right consistency.  We loved this dish.

This is a favorite at our house, especially for our ten-year-old son, who requests it on a weekly basis. I use chicken thighs and cook it in a small Romertopf (clay) covered pot, and it's always tender and juicy. If you're looking for a delicious, easy dish, this is a great one to add to your recipe box!

Loved it!  I used Worcestershire Sauce, cooked in a covered casserole dish at 375 for about 45 min. and used skinless, boneless thighs.  Not dry at all.  Also added a can of artichokes.  I thought of separating the chicken when done and thickening the sauce with corn starch the next time I make it.

Made this last night.  I had all the ingredients.  It was delicious.  I sautéed some mushrooms in butter and garlic and added that to my cassoulet.  I also took another person's suggestion and added some flour to the mixture.  I used an organic steak sauce from Whole Foods.  Since I used chicken tenders I only cooked it for about 18 minutes.  My husband loved it.  Next time I am going to add some peas to the mushrooms!

Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe has become a staple food in our monthly menus. I probably make it close to twice a month - my family loves this recipe. It is easy, delicious and elegant enough for company. I have also made this chick on the grill in the summer, adding the capers with the last turn and braising with the sauce as I grill it.

The chicken turned out tender, however, I didn't care for it at all.   I had cut the steak sauce in half and added some flour like others had suggested.   However, it tasted bitter, almost acidic.   I had just opened the bottle of capers, so, its not like they had gone bad.   I will not be trying this again.    Not sure how I could tweak it enough to like it.

Kids & men loved it! Chicken was very moist & tender and I started with frozen breasts. I didn't have a lemon so I used lemon juice form a bottle...not the best. I will make again but only if I have a real lemon!

I roasted chicken thighs and when almost done covered with the prepared sauce, which made for a decent meal, but probably wouldn't be something I'd repeat. Not bad mind you just wasn't a favorite of ours with so many other chicken dishes to choose from.  Made my own steak sauce from this site beforehand.

I've tried this recipe a few times and loved it. This time I didn't have lemons so I used a splash of apple cider vinegar instead. I also added some local honey I just got for kicks. It was delicious! I think I'll add honey from now on.

Thanks to some of the other reviews, I poured the juice over dry mashed potatoes. Perfect. One of my new favorite dinners.

I tried this tonight and thought it was yummy!  The flavor is kind of unique so it was a nice change of pace from our same old chicken.  I used chicken tenders and threw in a few artichokes for extra flavor.  Next time I will replace most or all the butter with veggie broth to cut the fat.  Served with mashed cauli.  Thanks!

Very easy and surprisingly good.  For a dinner for 2 I bought 3 large breast halves, cut each in half and pounded slightly.  Had 1 piece left over. The meat was swimming in sauce so no issues with dryness at all.  Used sauce on mashed potatoes.  All very yummy.  Will make again.  Oh yes, made in metal baking pan with no cover.

Simple and surprisingly delicious. We really enjoyed this. I served it over whole wheat pasta instead of rice.  I only coked the chicken about 15 minutes, which was almost too long. My guess is reviewers with "dry" chicken simply over-baked.  We always start checking a new recipe at about 1/2 the time listed to make sure we are accounting for how thick our cuts are and our oven temp.

I made this and it was a HIT! I made it first with steak sauce with Worcestershire sauce and the a second time with A-1 and both were amazing! My husband thinks the one with the Worcestershire sauce was better since it gave it a kick! Its a new fave recipe in my house.

I loved this recipe! So easy and very tasty. It was even better after sitting in the sauce for a couple of days in the refrigerator. That's my true test of a great recipe!!! Yum!

I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't really my thing.  It was good but I'm not sure how often I'd make it.  I just might not like capers as much as I thought I did...

We loved it and are passing it on to friends and family. I was apprehensive about the steak sauce idea,but really could barely detect it. So moist and a wonderful flavor. The capers just are the finishing touch.

What a delicious recipe. Dont let the simplicity fool you. This tastes like you spent hours preparing it. I used a cast iron pot with lid and followed the recipe exactly. Tender ,juicy and the sauce is perfect. The second time I prepared it for company, and doubled the amount of capers. Rave reviews from all and there wasnt a scrap leftover. Bravo!!!!!

I actually made this with pork instead of chicken and it turnd out great. It really sounded weird with the steak sauce in it, but it really added a great tang.

I am not much of a chicken fan and was looking for an easy recipe to serve 20+ women at a bunko luncheon party. This was amazing. Be sure to add the artichokes about half way through and sprinkle on some parmesan cheese. Fans of chicken picata will love this.

This is a great recipe and very simple!!  I cooked the chicken to 165 degrees and it was so moist.  My hubby, who prefers dark meat, raved about it.  Plus my picky eater, daughter asked for the recipe.  Thanks for an awesome recipe Shannon.

Made this last night for a party of 4, was a BIG hit! I loved that it was super easy and relatively healthy (used margarine & served with multigrain pasta). Next time I will follow other reviews & lessen the A1 sauce by even more (though no one complained, I noticed, but could be because of the reviews).

Used Kikkoman Steak Sauce, but thought it was too salty.  However my family loved it, so maybe I will cut back on the caper liquid next time.  Cooked it in a ceramic Bean Pot & chicken was moist.

I wonder if this would be good with a salsa or picante sauce instead of A1....or how about Heinze-57???  Anyone tried these substitutions?      I'll try Hienze-57 tomorrow and write back.

It was delicious. Very tangy! Probably won't use as much A-1 next time, but I used olive oil. Next time I will try with actual butter. The olive oil definitely made the mixture a problem for additional dipping sauce, but turned out great when it was baked!

I was very disappointed in the outcome of the recipe. I was skeptical at the ingredients then even more skeptical once I put them together. They didn't seem to go together. I gave the recipe 2 stars b/c it was edible, but something I would never choose to eat. I dipped the chicken in steak sauce to mask the flavor.

Absolutely wonderful! Only change I made was doubled the sauce and only added capers to the initial sauce-Didn't put any on after it came out of the oven. Will definitely make this again!

I like it more than FM is good for different flavor. FM prefered the sweet chicken (mustard and brown sugar) over this.

My family loved this dish. The chicken was very tasty.  Next time, I don't think I will use as much of the caper juice.
