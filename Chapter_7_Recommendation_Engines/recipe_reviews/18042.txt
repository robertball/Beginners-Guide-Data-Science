I wasn't too sure about making this after reading the reviews but we found it quite tasty.  I added more water and a 1/2 package of frozen mixed vegetables.  I wouldn't make it without the additional vegetables.  I also cooked it in the crock pot instead of in the oven.

Loved this recipe! Served it with salad and bread. I followed the previous reviewer suggestion of adding frozen vegetables and cooking in the crockpot. It was excellent! The whole family loved it =) We thought the seasoning was just right.

Newly married and already so critical? ;) 

I think this is an interesting recipe although I would be more inclined to add some fresh vegetables and fresh herbs. Cooking it in the oven (or on the stove) all day is a traditional italian method of cooking meat and it does leave it incredibly flavorsome and tender. Thanks Lauralyn.

I browned the meat and threw everything into a stew pot including the extra frozen veggies because I didn't have all day to waste cooking. I let the soup simmer while preparing a salad and breadsticks (20 min.) and the soup was terrific! This is a great (secret) minestrone!

My family loved the soup. 
I added two cups of diced potatoes and a can of red kidney beans.
I also doubled the meat and cooked on low in the crock pot for 8 hours
i added a handful of pasta an hour before serving

In all honesty I have an electric oven and couldn't justify baking this for for 8 hours. I too like another reviewer said and simmered it on the stove top. Perfect!
