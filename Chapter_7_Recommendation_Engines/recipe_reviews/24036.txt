This is very good! Does not say what kind of sausage to use,so I used mild italian,only 1 pound because that's all I had. I used 4 small cans of low salt chicken broth(less than stated) and 28oz can Contadina crushed tomatoes in puree. Since I didn't use full amount of broth, I figured I better cut back on seasoning, so I used only half of each. I didn't have zucchini,so I added a bag of frozen green beans with carrots. You could probaly use peas too. As it cooked I wanted it a little thicker so I added one more tablespoon flour mixed with a little water. This may be a little spicey for young ones,but my family loved it. Serve with bisquits and it's a great meal! Thanks Tim,we really enjoyed this!

I added an onion and 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 green pepper, 1/2 a red pepper.  I also added celery seed and red hot chili peppers.  I really enjoyed this recipe especially with what I added. It was easy and very yummy.  I will make this over and over again.

After being out of town for a week I wasn't in the mood for grocery shopping yet still needed to come up with something quick, healthy and satisfying for supper and this was it - coming home to find zucchini and peppers in my garden was a godsend. In no time flat and with very  little effort I had a wholesome, delicious meal on the table. This is a great starter recipe, one that allows for great latitude with your own tastes and ingredients in mind. I removed the casings from three Italian sausage links, browned it, then drained and rinsed it to remove the excess grease. I returned the sausage to the pan along with chopped onion, green pepper and garlic and cooked that in olive oil until the vegetables were almost tender. I didn't measure exactly, but added some of my own marinara sauce from my garden, the chicken broth, an Italian seasoning blend to taste and a healthy splash of red wine. I did not use the flour. I let that simmer for about half and hour and the aroma was wonderful!  Added the zucchini and acini di pepe as directed in the recipe and at the last added a can of cannellini beans. Ladled into big soup bowls and topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese this was a quick, impromptu meal to be proud of.

I made this recipe exactly as Tim had written it. The only change I made was that I doubled it for a church potluck.  I made it the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator until morning and then heated in my electric pot.  I came home from church with an empty bowl and requests from at least 6-8 people who want the recipe.  My family also tasted it and thought it was great.  Thanks Tim.

I wasn't sure what type of sausage to use either-I had a choice of kielbasa or Italian and I choose Italian (1.5 lbs). Took reviewer "Berrieboo's" advice and added chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped red and green bell pepper, and some celery seed. I think fennel seeds would also be a great addition if your not already using Italian sausage (some already have fennel seeds in the sausage). Also, no Acini de Pepe pasta so I used 3/4 cup of small egg noodles. Came out great! This was a warming lunch = esspecially since MN weather went from 87 degrees on Monday to snow today!! Thanks Tim!!

I changed a bit of the ingredients on this recipe. I used Polish sausage and maybe just half the amount called for. I don't have zucchini & acini di pepe pasta at home, so I use cucumber & spiral pasta instead. Once the 20 mins simmer is up, I put the spiral pasta in & simmer for another 10 mins & follow by the cucumber for another 10 mins. The taste is great & the cucumber is still crunchy.

Really simple and delicious.  My 5 year old goes in spurts with his eating, and when he's not eating much for more than a couple days I make him this soup.  He absolutely loves it and usually asks for seconds.

This recipe is now in my regular rotation.  It is SO good, really delicious, and everyone in my family cheers when they hear it is for dinner.  It makes a lot, and even with my family of four hearty eaters, there are always leftovers (hurray).  It would make a great potluck dish except for the need for bowls.  I use kielbasa (though I made it once with Italian sausage and that was good too) and tend to put a bit more zucchini in and double the amount of the pasta.  If you can find that particular kind of pasta, I encourage you to use it.

Quick and tasty.  I used mild italian sausage - yum.  I cut the recipe in half for two of us and there was enough left over for a second dinner.

Excellent.  I added a yellow pepper, onion, and fresh garlic.  Made fresh bread to accompany.  Husband and friends loved it.  Easy to freeze, too.

This came out more like a soup than a stew, but I am not complaining. It is totally delicious! Great to find a different way to prepare smoked sausage. I served it with a fat loaf of french bread to sop up the liquid. Perfect!

We enjoyed this and was a great way of using up some zucchini!  I will cut the sausage slices in half to make it a little easier to eat, but very tasty.  Thanks!

OMG!  This is one of the best soups in here! I've made it several times and everyone just loves it.  I do use the low sodium chicken broth, but that's the only difference.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Tim!

I took some of the ingredients and added a bunch of my own. Used the sausage, peeled tomatoes w/ basil and oregano added, butter, and zucchini. Used 8 oz of chicken stock, 1 cup of water, small can of tomato paste, one can of black eyed peas, small jar of chopped chilies, 1 1/2 cups of orzo pasta. Added 1 yellow squash, black pepper, pinch of sea salt, clove of garlic, and 4 basil leaves. Brought to a boil then stirred in orzo pasta and simmered for 20 minutes. Kids loved it. **next batch, suggest to added 16oz of chicken stock**

This stew has become a regular meal in our home. My whole family loves it. The only thing I do differently is that I use a slightly larger pasta to give the pasta a little more presence in the stew. I have picky eaters and this is something that we ALL love! Definite keeper!

Hmm..I made this because it got so many rave reviews..It was good but not OMG 5 stars - I probably should have read others suggestions in detail but was rushing..This is definitely more of a soup- I like a little more substance. I would consider making again w/others suggestions. Thanks!

I made this recipe tonight and I have to say it was really good. I added an additional tbsp. of flour and also used frozen corn in place of the zucchini and a different pasta since it was all I had on hand. I will have to try it with the real stuff next time. I did think that there was too much sausage for my preference, but the broth is so fantastic-a great recipe to add your own style to.

G'day! Was "wrapped" when I came across this recipe! It sound have been called "Put in Everything but the Kitchen Sink Stew!"
I diced the zucchini in small pieces for colouring and appearance! I also included a canned of drained cannelloni beans! BONUS!! I included (3) 425 g of commercially bought Garlic, Black Pepper, Herbs and Spices! 
Needless to say, I'll have to be making extra batches for the very near future!! THANKS!!

GREAT RECIPE!!  My family loved it.  My husband decided to make a pot of rice in order to fully enjoy the sauce that it makes.  I never follow the recipe to the letter.  I always feel the need to make it mine so I added a few spices that were not listed but flavors I know my family likes and it worked.  We were practically fighting over the leftovers.  Thanks.  This is definitely a keeper.

With the sausage I used, this was a great combo of flavors.  It seemed a bit greasy, so I chilled it overnight then skimmed the fat off the top the next day. Next time we get italian sausage, we will get an extra couple pounds so we can make this stew!

This is so delicious and easy.  I followed everything pretty much to a tee but just used gluten free pasta and flour to fit my dietary needs.  It is delicious the next day too!

I add sliced carrots and celery to the receipe. Love this soup. I also use Jimmy Dead Reduced Fat Sausage and fry it up like hamburger instead of using link sausage.

This has to be one of my favorite recipes for smoked sausage... it both smells and tastes fantastic!  The minor changes I made were to use 1 can of chicken broth,one can of tomato sauce and a little white wine  per 1 lb of beef smoked sausage.  I substituted orzo pasta and added frozen cut green beans instead of zucchini.  A wonderful dinner with corn muffins and iced tea!

Very good. Very few small changes-I used rice instead of the pasta and used sweet italian sausage. I also added green pepper, a couple of minced garlic cloves and a touch of beef broth with the chicken broth. A keeper!

I used hot Italian sausages and  sliced them it into 1/2 inch slices (blobs with 1/2 inch casings, really). After browning, I added a couple of carrots, a stalk of celery, a medium onion, and 2 cloves of garlic; chopped medium (the garlic was minced). After sauteing for 5 minutes, added 2 Tbsp flour and cooked a couple more minutes. Followed the recipe for the rest, except couldn't find acini di pepe, so substituted pastina  (which are dopey little stars in my fine soup, definitely have to get the right pasta for guests). Result is definitely soupy, not stewy. I love this soup, and with two bowls in my tummy right now, I know it loves me, too.

I can't say enough about this recipe. We use hot chicken Italian sausage, red pepper flakes, 3 14.5oz cans of broth with no change in the recipe's measurements for the basil and oregano, 1/2 an onion, garlic, celery seed, and some extra flour thanks to everyone's suggestions. I think a 1/2 cup of acini di pepe pasta is plenty, but if you're using a larger type of pasta you may wish to throw in a bit more.

This got a 4/5 from my husband who said it would be a 5 if it were spicier. He probably would have liked Tabasco added, but I'm thinking maybe andouille sausage. I think letting it simmer longer would have enhanced the flavor enough. I sized it for 2 servings but it made plenty because I added more veggies. I added garlic, a can of Great Northern beans (w/o juice), green & red peppers (one each), sliced mushrooms and 2 stalks celery. It was a nice presentation with the red/green color combination. I also substituted olive oil for the butter, and veggie broth instead of the chicken. Tim, thanks for sharing!

This was a great & very tasty recipe. It was very easy to make and has a bold taste. The only thing I did differently was add half an onion chopped and 4 cloves garlic.

Was good, but not great.  Lots of Zucchini, but was more broth like than stew like.  Itried to thicken in up with some cornstarch, but I guess I didn't add enough or whatever, but I was so hungry I couldn't wait for it to thicken.  Also I couldn't find the pasta he was talking about, I used soy elbow's instead.  Was very good.  Might use rice next time.  Added onions, red and green peppers, and garlic like some reviewers suggested.

I thought this recipe was extra special when I added extra fennel seed, fresh oregano, and fresh Italian parlsey.  A sprinkle of crushed red pepper didn't hurt either.

I halved the recipe, however, used the full can of tomatoes.I used an onion, some carrots and corn instead of the zucchini., and had veggie broth on hand, so substituted it for the chicken broth. I also added a few chili flakes as we like it spicy! It was an awesome soup and I'll definitely be making it again.

My husband requested Sausage Stew yesterday day & this was the recipe I went with.  It was fantastic- very flavorful.  My only suggestion is to use a little more flour, as it is more of a soup than a stew.  We served it over rice like a gumbo.

I can't believe how much I love this stew! Of course, I add other things like onion, more acini pasta but not much else. Wonderful change from the ordinary and fantastic flavor, nice aroma. This recipe is one to share!

This was easy to put together and a nice combination of flavors. My husband liked it better than I did; I thought that it was just a bit heavy on the seasonings for it to rate a five-star. Some minor adjustments next time and I'm betting it will be a winner for me too!

This recipie is great for cold days, and very easy for a "whatever's in the pnatry" day. I used golden roma tomatos instead of the usual. It added great color and flavor. I also ,like some others, added diced onions. I used 10 oz of small shell pasta and sausage from the italian deli that was stuffed with tomato,basil and ricotta. Because the sausage had Ricotta cheese in it Idid not drain the sausage after I browned and just added a little extra flower. The ricotta sausage added awesome flavor. Then I just added salt and pepper to taste and served with fresh baked crusty bread. My 5 year old even liked it!

Awsome recipe! My husband is a big smoked sausage fan and was happy with the stew! We need more smoked sausage recipes like this! Thanks for the recipe!
