It sounds horrid.  But then I stopped and thought about how much I love egg in Asian food.  I actually order EXTRA egg in my pad thai.  As soon as that thought crossed my mind I knew I had to give this recipe a try.  When I told my husband what I was planning to make, he had the same reaction I did.  I ended up serving this on top of chicken fried rice and it was WONDERFUL.  Would I eat this dish on it's own for breakfast?  Not a chance in the world.  They do, however, make the perfect topper for Asian dishes!  Smooth, creamy, and loaded with umami. A good sub for Maggi sauce is an even mix of soy sauce and worcestershire. EDIT: Can I just say how magnificent these things were the next day after being mixed in with the leftover fried rice I originally served them with?  Ohmyword, if they were a 4 the first day they're definitely a 5 the second...and seriously, how often do you say something like that about eggs?

I liked the idea of combining peanut butter and eggs but I felt the other spices ruined the taste.

This recipe is amazing! I knew I wanted to try eggs with peanut butter because I thought it sounded good, but I wasn't sure about the ginger and garlic and thought well I guess I'll at least try it. But oh my gosh with that and the sauces it is so good! The taste reminds me of ham fried rice. It would be amazing with him fried rice, noodles, or any other ethnic dish! Definitely give this recipe a try you won't regret it!

Sounds weird, is actually great, but, hey, that's life right? Seriously though, I put this over some fried rice and it was fantastic! Not sure I'd eat it all alone, but rice was the perfect way to turn it into a meal ??
