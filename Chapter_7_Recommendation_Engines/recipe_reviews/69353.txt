I tried this recipe last nite and it was extremely bitter. It would likely be fine with just 1-3 slices of lemon or lime.

Bitter and sour. I decreased the amount of citrus as recommended by the second reviewer but it didn't help. Would not make again.

This is bitter. I like bitter as a flavor but this was a bit much for me. Some red pepper flakes and sour cream toned it down so then I liked it
