Great dough!! Just a tip to those who do not make bread often or are just begining to make bread, use the amount of flour the recipe calls for and really knead it well. This does 2 things, it helps to develope the gluten in the flour and it also helps the flour to soak in all the water. If you have a kitchen aid or something similer this is the time to use it. I needed about 2 rounded T. of more flour but that can be due to the fact that it was a wet rainy day out. The weather will alter the dough so if you are not used to working with yeast bread try it on a dry day first. This should be a soft spongy dough that is very elastic not a firm dry dough. Also, even with the mixer I still do the last 2 min. of kneading by hand. You have to FEEL the dough to get it just right. This will hold true for any yeast dough that you work with. I didn't make a traditional baton or round loaf either. I rolled it out a bit and made long cuts almost to the edge and spread the dough out to make it a bread that is a rip and dip. I coated the top with olive oil and sea salt. It came out very light with a great texture. If you like a soft crust place a damp clean dish towel over it as soon as it comes out of the oven. If you like it really crisp throw some ice cubes in the bottom of the oven to create steam, it will first soften the outside and then get really crisp. If it doesn't work out for you the first time keep trying. It is worth it. BTW, keep altitude in mind as well. Good luck.

Very good.  Nice and tender.  I use a KitchenAid mixer to do all the work.  I sometimes use Rapid Rise yeast and can get this on the table within two hours. Taste the same as regular yeast.  I like to use one cup of whole wheat flour for the white to make it a little healthier.

This was a good, basic recipe.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used Extra Virgin and I put a pan of hot water in the oven to give it a crispier crust.  The overall density of the bread was too heavy for me, but it was extremely tasty.

Excellent! Made a beautiful loaf. Followed recipe exactly, except I did not use the egg wash. Brushed with melted butter. Taste was perfection!

This baguette might have the crunchiest crust of any bread I've made -I've been looking for such a crust for quite a while! I also like the soft texture of the inside, and the taste too, although it might be a little bit sweet for me. I baked it for 25 mn and it was slightly overcooked, so next time I'll have to remember that. A good bread all in all, not quite like my favorite baguettes as for the taste and appearance, but definitely a keeper.

I decided to add to this recipe. For the first mixing stage I added a half of a minced onion, and about 3 tbls. of minced garlic. When it was ready to roll out and be formed into loaves, I rolled up a mixture of crumbled 3 cheese blend. I put cornmeal on both the top and the bottom. Wow. Talk about yummy.

Great bread! Not the crustiest in the world, but this made for a great way to enjoy the extra sauce from the Thai Steamed Mussels we made from this site. The entire loaf was consumed by just two people :) I used someones tip of letting the dough rise in the oven with the light on, and that worked perfectly. I will use this tip for future loaves as well. I did have to use more flour than called for, but my loaf wasn't too dense at all, as some have complained. All in all a great, versatile loaf of bread. I would have just liked a bit more crustiness.

Yum! This was my first attempt at making bread without the help of a breadmachine. This recipe was easy and turned out great! I added a bit of garlic powder to the dough and it tasted wonderful. I gave it four stars instead of five because the inside was a little denser than I had expected (although that could be totally my fault)

This is an easy and reliable recipe. I have made bagettes several times using this recipe and they always taste good!
Makes great toast in the morning too. Toast is especially good with real butter and a smear of "natural" peanut butter on it. Yum-Yum

I thought this recipe makes a beautiful baguette with good taste and texture.  I used bread flour instead of the all-purpose flour because I like French bread with that great chew.  I started the kneading process in my KA then finished by hand to obtain the right texture.  I also added a shallow pan of water in the oven to create a heartier crust.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow....nothin but good.  I used my bread machine on the "dough" cycle to make this using rapid rise yeast.  Took out ALL of the work.   I let it rise in the machine, took it out,  shaped it and let it rise until double, baked for 20 minutes.  It was soooo good.  I wish that white bread didn't make me fat......alas....I will only be able to make this once in awhile....

Excellent!! Better than store bought any day. I followed the recipe with the following exception....when you add your yeast to the warm water, add your sugar and nothing else til AFTER the yeast proofs. Don't add the salt til later...I usually add it in the flour,  as it kills the yeast when added too soon. After about 10 minutes the yeast was ready so I added everything else then. Let it rise in the (cold) oven with only the light inside as the heat source. It will rise fine this way. Took 27 minutes to bake. This is a keeper! Thanks.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I liked how simple it was to make. I mixed and kneaded all of the ingredients in my Kitchen-Aid mixer on low. I mixed the yeast, water, and sugar and let it proof for about 5 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I sprayed a piece of parchment paper with PAM and lined my sheet and then sprinkled the greased sheet with cornmeal. I like the lite crunch, to the crust, and the added cornmeal. It was good warm with some fresh butter. I just wish it was a little more like a baguette, but I kind of knew it wouldn't be without the starter. It worked well tonight with dinner though.

I've adapted this for my bread machine.  I subtracted about 1/4 cup of flour so that the dough is just slightly wet and sticky.  After the machine ran its 90 minute dough cycle, I still went through the two additional rising times in this recipe.  This is the BEST French bread I've made - and I've tried a lot of recipes on allrecipes.com.

this is my favorite French bread recipe . I made some changes: I use only 1 TBS of Sugar , EVO and after shaping the dough in to a loaf and placing it on the baking sheet I brush it with a very cold water and I don't cover it(that will make it more crusty) let it rise for almost 30 mins or until it's doubled in size  .I love to bake it in the AirBake pizza pan (the baking sheet that has holes in the bottom) that will give it a crusty bottom . it takes only 20 mins in the oven but it depends on your oven and the baking sheet you use

Fabulous recipe. Fine, moist crumb, with a shiny, thin crust. I spritzed the loaf periodically during baking with water to ensure crispiness. It was crisp for a short time, but then became chewy, which was OK. It's delicious both ways. Perfect baguette, none better.

I have often failed at making bread from scratch & have used my breadmaker often.  The bread maker comes NO WHERE close to this.  First attempt tasted good but was dense.  My next five attempts went MUCH better when I followed suggestions: 1) combine water, yeast and sugar ahead. making sure water is warm enough - use a thermometer - dont guess, I mixed and let sit for 10 minutes until creamy and bubbly - if you dont have bubbles, your yeast is probably old & wont rise well  2) only put the 2 c flour in to start with salt (I decreased salt, hold off on the oil for now), add the "proofed" yeast/sugar water 3) after this has mixed well (about 5 minutes) I used a kitchen aid mixer with bread hook,  until bread is tacky moist, you may need to add more flour, I do it by the TBSPN - like others it took about 2 1/2 c 4) add oil 5) when bread forms together (still tacky) remove from mixer and knead with some additional flour for 6-10 minutes - you tube has some good videos on kneading techniques.  Follow the rest of the recipe.  Having a warm kitchen/area for it to rise seems to help a lot.  First time I think the kitchen was too cold.  Second time I put bowl with wet towel ontop of the heating stove.  I preheat my oven for at least 1 hour - that seemed to help too.  I like crusty so I did egg wash and ice cubes in oven.  I baked on pampered chef pizza stone.  I've added herbs, cheese, garlic and onion with great success.  Really delicious bread.  Can't wait to try whole wheat.

This was the best bread that I have ever made.  I have been trying to make a bread like this for about five years.  I finally found the texture that my family has been looking for. I don't necessarily think I want this for a "french bread", but the texture was perfect for a sandwich, not only the day I made it, but in the following days.  The other recipes I have made from this site are really good, but they crumble and are unuseable the next day for a hearty sandwich.  This recipe stays really soft on the inside, and does not fall apart like other breads. I doubled the recipe, and put both loaves on a baking sheet.  Thank you so much!

This bread is delicious. I tend to add 1 TBS more water, 1/2 tbs LESS sugar, and knead for 8-10 minutes. When it comes time to bake, use scissors instead of a knife to make tiny snips that look like a "v." One of the photos on the recipe shows the result. I always have to cook for about 30 minutes too, since I make a wider loaf. I also skip the egg part. Very tasty bread with a crunchy crust on the bottom. Yum!

Had never made any kind of yeast bread before & thought I'd give it a shot.  This recipe turned out pretty good french bread for me even with my limited knowledge of french bread kneading and rolling!  So for that, I'm extremely grateful for this recipe.  :)  I did everything as directed except used melted butter instead of the egg white to brush over the dough.  I made two smaller loaves, shaped them into baguettes, & baked on a pizza stone.  They were so beautiful & crusty, the hubster thought I had bought them from the market.  ;)

Excellent! This is the first time that I have ever made bread without a bread machine. Followed the recipe exactly except that I proofed the yeast for 10 minutes with 1tsp. of the sugar and sprinkled sesame seeds on top before baking. My boyfriend was really impressed as well as myself! Will definitley not look for a different recipe!

This is one of the only recipes I've ever tried that I didn't feel the need to alter AT ALL.  It is absolutely perfect as is, and even though I used spelt flour instead of all-purpose (wheat-allergies), it was amazing.  I will be making this all the time now!!

So very pleased with this recipe! It's the closest I've come so far to copying store-bought french bread without spending hours in the kitchen! Just remember that you have a whole tray of steaming water in the oven and to keep your face away when you open the door to check on the bread. I almost steam-burned my eyeballs with this lack of common sense!

Great Recipe!! I got a really crunchy crust by giving the bread 3 sprays of water while cooking, when it goes in the oven, half way through the baking process and the last 5mins before it comes out!

I have been making this bread for 40 years, w/ the exception of the oil,making this fat free :0).  For those who wished for a crunchier crust, after brushing w/ egg white(beaten w/ a tablespoon of water),sprinkle on some seeds,white or black sesame seeds poppy seeds, flax seeds, makes "everything" bread. Place a baking pan (9x13) in the bottom of the preheating oven, then pour boiling water into it, creating steam. After 20 minutes of baking time, brush the bread(lightly) w/ cool water every 10 minutes of remaing baking time. It will make a nice crust. Have fun, bread making is so theraputic.

I have made this several times now and this last time it turned out just beautiful!  I doubled the recipe each time and I used a full 2 T honey instead of sugar, and I only used 2 t salt this time.  I think I finally got the hang of kneading, thanks to @miki. I kneaded it for 6 minutes, formed it into 3 loaves on a cookie sheet, sprinkled it with oat bran and sprayed it with butter-flavored cooking spray, and it turned out light as a feather! Awesome!  Bread of the gods!

Excellent Recipe! Perfect bread. My family (especially my hubby) loved this and has requested it daily. I followed the recipe and had no issues and ended up with a delicious, crusty outside, soft inside bread. I will definately be making this often. Thanks for sharing!

The only thing I changed was 1Tbs of oil instead of 2Tbs. I was reading about French bread from Julia Childs cookbook and she says in France the only ingrediants they can use in a French loaf is, salt and sugar, flour, yeast and water. Its some kind of old law. The bread seems to stay fresh longer with the addition of oil. My crust was a bit too soft but otherwise perfect.

This is an excellent basic recipe - easy and relatively fast to put together.  I use my Kitchenaid with the dough hook and don't even have to knead it much myself then.  Also, I occasionally add some whole wheat flour just because my son is on a health kick (this too shall pass).  I do the boiling water in the cold oven trick too, for letting it rise, since the house is rarely warm.  Also, I put the sugar in with the yeast and hot water - the yeast feeds on it and activates a little quicker.  I put the salt in last, since that kills the yeast.

Yummy and oh so easy!!! Followed the directions except I didn't have cornmeal but it didn't matter.  I also cheated with the kneading and let my dough hooks do the work but it still turned out fantastic.  I'm going to be teaching my ESE students this recipe tomorrow and many teachers have requested a loaf.

I am the world's WORST breadmaker!  But, I continue to try.  I read all the reviews for this recipe for 2 days before working up my nerve to try again.

I came out FABULOUS and  I'm still smiling!!!!  Followed the recipe to a T, except I added the salt to the flour, not the yeast mixture, as suggested by many others.

It was delicious, better than any store bought around here.   I live in the Adirondack mountains, in NY, on an island in the middle of a lake both Summer and Winter, boat or snowmobile access only, so getting to a store is not always easy.  We love French bread and this will be made frequently in my house from now on.  The ice cubes in the oven seemed to help a lot.

I am thrilled to death for this recipe.  Thanks to all!

This bread is super easy to make and tastes great, too.  My family eats most of it in one meal, and I leave the leftover on the counter for a few days then pulse it in the food processor for bread crumbs.

I've made homemade pizza crust before, but this was my first attempt at making homemade bread. I made it tonight, and it turned out great! Very easy, too! I should've read the directions a bit better, though, before I got into the recipe. Although it's very easy, you have to allow time for the bread to rise...not once, but 3 times. I'll know to plan ahead next time, so it's ready in time for dinner. I'll be making this often!

This was good!  I used a ratio of 2:1, white: ww flour and was pleased with the results.  I also made a topping of onion, garlic, sea salt, sesame and poppy seeds to sprinkle on the top prior to baking (like an everything bagel).  I would make this again.

This recipe is great. I'm a novice cook and I used a bread machine with the setting of French bread just to knead the dough. 
 I used bread flour instead of all purpose and bread machine yeast and it worked well. I made once with the bread as a full loaf and a second one divided in 2 for 2 smaller crusty loaves. Both were great. I didn't have corn meal and substituted bread crumbs on the greased pan and it worked like a charm.

I adapted this recipe to make in the bread machine on dough cycle. It was very moist and delicious and I liked the crust. I baked it without the egg wash. After it came out of the oven I slathered it with butter. It was terrific and it went great with my soup!

This is a terrific French bread recipe.   It bakes up crusty and chewy, with a nice yeasty flavor.  I don't brush the loaves with egg white, and I still get a great crust.  For even better flavor, allow the dough to rise all day.  Just keep punching it down.

Great recipe! The first time I've ever made French bread, but it came out perfect! I reduced the salt to just 1 tsp, because 1 1/2 tsp seemed like too much. I misread the recipe and brushed the bread with 1 egg white mixed with 1 tb of water instead of 1 tsp, which is probably why it came out with a nice crust, but wasn't extremely crunchy. Makes great French toast! 5 stars!

This is wonderful bread and easy to make. I am very new to baking bread, have only made Sy's Challah from here and this. I made the challah first and it was good; I gave it 5 stars. I'd give this 6 if I could! I love that it makes one large loaf instead of 2. I've made this one twice and hot from the oven it's divine and toasted the next morning it's better than any store bought that's less than five bucks a loaf. I've tried it with and without the egg wash. My submitted photos (red background) are without the egg wash and the crust was nice and soft, which my husband and son like. I prefer the crispy, crackly, chewy crust sometimes and the egg wash got it sort of there, but not as much as I like. Will have to research it a little further. This recipe is time consuming, but not at all difficult or hard work, at least not for me with my kitchenaid with the bread hook.

One of the nicest bread recipes I've made from this site.  I took the advice of a reviewer below and added a few ice cubes into the bottom of my oven near the end of baking time to allow the steam from the ice to make a hard crust.  Very nice taste and texture.

I must have done something wrong or maybe the weather outside had something to do with it but, this dough didn't get stiff until after about 4 1/2 cups of flour were added. Then it was rubbery. 

I managed to get it in the oven even though it delayed dinner by an hour. When it came out, It had risen and split apart along the side. When I cut into it, I found the texture inside not to be as light as I expected it was more dense. 

It was edible. My husband says he liked it. I liked the taste also but I know this recipe could have been better. Some things I did differently with it was that I used EVOO for the oil and used my kichenaid mixer with dough hook attachment to do the work for me. Perhaps this had something to do with it? My yeast was good and I bloomed it in water that was 114 degrees on the thermometer so that couldn't have been the problem. 

I served it with Hot spinach and artichoke dip also from this website.

This is the best French Bread recipe ever! I've even started it in my bread machine until after the first rise, (dough cycle) then take it out and finish as recipe directs and it always comes out perfect. Just follow the bread machines directions for putting in ingredients and use the dough cycle. Either way you make it it is awesome bread. I tried another recipe on here specifically for the bread machine and it was a total failure. This one works. I've also shaped it into 8 rolls instead of a loaf, let them raise for about 40 minutes and then baked for about 18 mintues. This has become my go to recipes for bread and rolls.

This is a Taste of Home recipe.  The bread came out tender and soft on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside. I made 4 great sub buns.

OMG!!! Finally a bread that lives up to its name.This was the first bread I have made start to finish on my own. (NO BREADMACHINE) This bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just like it should be. Not dense at all like breadmachine breads. Followed the recipe to the letter but without the egg wash. I am at almost 7000 feet and I changed nothing. Great recipe will keep this one for sure

I love the simplicity of this recipe! I've made it twice and recommend adding the egg white wash before baking to give it the nice toasty color and crispy crust. It's missing one star because it's lacking some flavor that I can't figure out in typical French bread. I'm going to try different flours next time and see if the flavors change.

This bread is FABULOUS. I have made this quite a few times since discovering the recipe, and have gotten perfect bread every time. It makes for fantastic garlic bread (I use the butter recipe from Cheesy Garlic Bread). Interestingly, my two year-old LOVES garlic bread (she just licks it-go figure), so I form a pretty thin roll,then cut them in about one inch pieces and fill up a glass pan. When they're done I brush them with the garlic bread mixture. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! ADDITION: I forgot to mention that I've used both Olive and Vegetable oils, and haven't noticed a difference. Also, I have never used more than 2 1/2 cups of flour-probably because I use All-Purpose. And I brush the top with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter at the end (I'm not a fan of crunchy/crusty bread. I'm going to try making this with fresh herbs. Rosemary or Basil, maybe. I'm sure it'll be great!

It's my first time baking with yeast. I ended up using 2 1/2 cups of flour only and used olive oil instead of vegetable. I don't know if I made a mistake or something but while I was kneading my dough, it wouldn't blend into itself to form a nice round dough. Instead, my dough just kept stretching and there were tons of crease marks and folds, so I added more water but it didn't make too much of a difference. I decided to make a braid with my dough because it wouldn't form a circle. I added salt and sprinkled cheese on top after coating with the egg mix. I also don't know if this is a normal occurance with baking with yeast, but when I opened the oven, a ton of smoke came rushing out. The result was a really good crustiness on the outside, but the inside of the dough was only ok because it seemed undercooked, I put it back in the oven to cook an additional 10 min but the only thing it did was made my bread more crusty.

This was my first time making a yeast bread.  After killing the yeast on the first go, this came out really well the second time around.  It is very easy to make, and very, very tasty.  I think it is better than the bread they sell at the supermarket.  Great recipe.

Great bread! I doubled the recipe and baked it in my French bread loaf pan. I also cut the amount of salt down to 1 tsp. (two for the double batch) Because the pan has holes in the bottom for airflow, I skipped the cornmeal step. Other than that, I made this as written and was very pleased with the results. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...my family absolutely loved it!

Delish !  Use your Kitchen Aid if you have one and this gets super easy.   I tossed some fresh rosemary into the dough, brushed the top with good extra virgin olive oil and fresh cracked sea salt.  As one reviewer recommended, toss a handful of ice cubes directly onto the bottom or your oven.  The steam will give your bread that great, crunchy, flaky crust that French bread is known for.

This bread was so good! I'm new to cooking/baking in general, and I'm currently on a bread kick, so I'm making all the French/Italian bread recipes I come across on this site. The last recipe I tried wasn't bad, but a bit dense and flavorless (probably because I used too much flour). For this recipe, I actually ran out of flour before I finished kneading, which left my bread really sticky. I was pretty worried about it and had to grease my bowl a LOT to keep it from sticking to my hands during the punching/shaping stages, but I think in the end, having slightly less flour than I needed worked out for me, because my bread was SO SOFT and fluffy inside (and very crunchy on the outside, though a little too brown on the bottom). So thank you for the recipe! I will definitely be using it again in the future.

wow!  I live in a rural village in Honduras and when I crave something I either have to drive 90 minutes or do without.  So when I was craving a good loaf of french bread I decided to see if I could make it myself.  This recipe was great! I've never made bread before and it is delicious!    I didn't have corn meal so I had to use flour and the bread stuck to the pan where the egg wash dripped down.  Next time I'd use way less egg wash or maybe try the olive oil that other reviewers suggested.  My only other complaint is that I've never made bread before so when I saw prep time 20 minutes cook time 25 minutes I actually thought I'd have a yummy loaf of french bread in less than an hour!  3 hours later it was worth the wait but wish I'd known.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't like this at all.  It was doughy and had no flavor. I consider myself to be a very good baker and have made many types of bread successfully, but I did not care for this.  I'll stick to my French bread recipe that came with my Kitchen Aid mixer.

This is a fabulous recipe!! I make all kinds of breads & this is going in my bread section of my cooking book :)  It's great all by itself or if you want more flavor, try this.... I added 1/4 cup of grated parmasean,romono, asiago cheese while my kitchen aid was mixing in the last cup of flour. After all the risings & egg wash I sprinkled on some more of the grated cheese and a herb garden seasoning I had.  The flavor is wonderful...not too much at all . YUM if I do say so myself! :) I'm planning on using it for a bruschetta tonight!! Thanks for sharing the recipe :D OH and one little tip for those who felt the bread was a little dense, try letting it rise longer. some times the yeast just needs more time to work.

This is amazing! I did modify a bit. I disolved 1 tsp of sugar in the water then added the yeast. I didn't add anymore sugar. I used Olive Oil instead of veg oil and I used 2tsp salt. Instead of egg white, I brushed the top with melted butter & sprinkled it with salt. I put a baking dish of boiling water in the oven with the bread and baked it for 40 minutes. It was PERFECT.

Bravo!!  I found this recipe very easy to follow.  Although bread can seem to be an easy thing ingrediant wide, I have had some trouble in the past.  I am determined to perfect it as I know it can't be as hard as I am making it.  Living in higher altitude has made it a bit more difficult.  However this recipe turned out fabulous!!  I used two cups of breada flour and one cup of whole wheat flour.  I also put a handful of ice cubes and a bit of water inside the oven just as I put the loaf it.  The result was a large fluffy loaf with a crusty outside.  Thank you for a great recipe and thanks to other reviewers for their great tips!

Bread is definitely my weakness and this one did not disappoint. It was the perfect compliment for the "Russian Potato Mushroom Soup" I made from this site. Will probably make this bread with every soup I make.

This was my first attempt at home-made bread.  It came out FANTASTIC!!!  I'm making it again today!  I love the soft crust.

WOW! so i loved this and this is my first time making bread successfully.  I used the rising instructions for the kalamata olive bread though, which you warm the bowl first for the first rising and then the second rising u put it in a prewarmed over (at 150) for 30 min.  Speed up the process alot.  I also added probally 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and a little garlic powder.  I used the garlic butter recipe to put on the bread...yummy!

mine came out good but it was pretty dense on the inside. The taste wasn't bad. Bland but edible.I would try this recipe again. I tried the ice cubes, but still not as crispy as i would like.

Quite good although it did not rise as high as expected and it was a bit dense. I will try this next time with bread flour instead or add some wheat gluten instead of the all purpose this calls for. The two of us ate the whole loaf within half an hour of coming out of the oven though!

I've always wanted to make bread by hand, but never seemed to have yeast and enough flour in my cupboards at the same time.  

This bread turned out perfectly!  I was so proud of myself!  

No complaints at all about density, crust, rising issues, etc.  I followed the recipe exactly (except the cornmeal... I didn't have any)and it turned out perfectly.

Can't wait to steam some mussels and bake up a batch of this bread again.

I loved this recipe.  I loved it so much I tripled it and made extra loaves for my friends, who also loved it.  I have grown tired of store bough bread and decided to do this myself and this is the best french bread recipe. I even made hamburger buns which was a nice twist.

Great recipe! This turned out really well for me, which was a surprise because I don't have the best luck with making yeast breads; french bread, in particular. My loaves always come out flat and dense, but this recipe yielded a nice exception. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars, and not 5 is for two reasons: First off, after I shaped into a long loaf and put it to rise it wound up becoming flat and wide, just as all my other french bread attempts have turned out. Rather than baking it then I decided to re-knead, roll out into a rectangle, then roll up into a baguette shape... that was the ticket to a loaf that didn't lose volume or become flat after letting it rise for the 25 mins. Secondly, this bread turned out a little bland for me. I think next time I will put 2 tsp. of salt and use melted butter instead of the oil. Hopefully that will help. Aside from the two *very minor* fixes, this is a superb recipe that I will continue to use as a starting point. The dough worked up so perfectly, too, which was great. I couldn't believe how light and soft-textured it was, and kneading it was a complete pleasure... this turned out really pretty, too!

While the bread wasn't bad, I found it rather bland and not at all the type of crusty French loaf I was anticipating (and hoping for).

Great recipe, but since when does something that requires nearly 2 hours of rising time ready in 45 minutes? With rising, baking, and prep time all combined, you're looking at around 3 hours of work, which is standard for bread making.

This was my 3rd attempt at making bread, by fast the easiest! Tasty, crunchy crust, soft inside. I followed the directions exactly using my bread maker to do the mixing. I had to add half a cup of flour during the first cycle to get the consistency described. I formed it on a pan and let it rise again for 20 min. Delicious!

Omg this is some good bread!  Wish I would have made extra to freeze.  The egg wash is a must if you want a nice golden top on the bread, otherwise it will be washed out looking.  I used part of this to slice and make it garlic cheese rounds.  LOVE this recipe!!

This bread is really easy to put together and my family really loved it.  I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the flour and used 2 cups of bread flour for the remainder of the flour.  It has a very nice appearance and is soft on the inside with a nice outer crust that it's too hard.  Thank you for the recipe!

this will now be my go-to french bread recipe when im having soups or spaghetti... or spinach dip!  the crust is light and crusty, the inside soft and fluffy. i agree with Miki, it was a tad sweet for my tastes, and i DID make one change, using one cup AP flour and one cup bread flour, with the additional flour  added in being AP.  Next time ill cut back on the sugar, and possibly refrigerate the dough for a day or two to develope a more 'sour' flavor. But alas, this recipe DEFINATELY made my most beautiful looking loaf that i have baked to date.  Thanks for posting!

A little more dense than I thought it would be but super easy. Husband and kid approved. Good for dipping in oil/balsamic vinegar too. Will definitely make again.

Good bread, easy to make, especially with a mixer with a bread hook. Not as flavorful as I thought it was going to be. For a crispier crust, add a pan with ice to the oven.

A little time consuming but perfect for a weekend treat. The bread rose perfectly and tasted delicious. I used my KitchenAid stand mixer and just kneaded it for about 4-5 minutes on setting #2. I may add some different aromatic herbs next time during the mixing process for a twist.

I made this bread today, using 15 ml Quickrise yeast, all-purpose flour and olive oil. I put everything in the Kitchen-Aid mixer bowl, using the dough hook to mix everything first, after which the machine kneaded the dough for about 7 minutes. I did not do any kneading myself. The bread came out beautiful, although not as crusty as I would like, but I find the recommended baking time is a little short, and will bake it longer next time. The salt and oil did not kill the yeast as some commentators suggest. I put everything in together from the start and the dough did rise perfectly well.

This was my first time ever making bread.  My daughter has been wanting to make bread for a while and I told her we would do it today.  However, when I got up it was a really humid and rainy day and was not sure if it would affect the outcome.  It was a really simple recipe to make.  It did not seem to rise the way the recipe said, however I used bread flour and rapid rising yeast.  Maybe this had something to do with it.  Mine did not look as perfect as the picture.  It looked more rustic.  DH said it looked better than the ones at the store.  Guess I did something right.  LOL  I also made the Honey Wheat II bread loaves, but have yet to try them.  Will review that too.

Great recipe.  Made it 3 times.  First 2 times, the bread was a bit heavy and dense.  The third time, I made sure that I don’t over add flour to the dough.  I also modified the recipe slightly.  I added 1 tablespoon of gluten flour because I use all purpose flour.  I also changed the steps slightly, because I use traditional yeast, I added my yeast, sugar to the warm water in a big bowl and let my yeast dissolved for about 5 min.  I left out the salt and oil to be added later because reviews tell me that these ingredients when added too early may kill the yeast.  After the 5 minutes, I then add the oil and salt to the yeast paste, add the TBS gluten flour and enough flour (holding back at least 1 cup to be added in small quantity for kneading). Stir and mix the dough, it should still be quite wet, I coat my work space with flour, floured my hands and take the dough for kneading.  Gradually add more flour (small amount each time) to reduce stickiness and continue kneading.  For me, I find 10 minutes of kneading make my dough elastic and smooth.  I also find that I don’t need all the flour stated in the recipe.The rest, I follow the recipe exactly.  It is absolutely wonderful.  My family are picky, the first two times, they said the bread taste good but they said it needs improvement because it is not fluffy.  The third time (with the changes), they said the bread is better than store bought.  No more heavy & dense bread!!!

I made this bread the other day and then I made it again today.  My husband says it is the best bread I have ever made.  Tomorrow I am going to double the recipe so we will see how it works.  It is just a wonderful bread.

I never thought I could make French Bread. Since I found this recipe I have used it 3 times and the last time was for a dinner party. My daughters loved it. If you have never made French Bread this is a very easy Recipe. It is also easy to double the recipe

I've been experimenting with different bread recipes, more for my daughter's lunch sandwiches than for dinner bread. I made this recipe following the recipe exactly. The only change I made was baking it in a loaf pan coated with the oil and cornmeal so it would have the proper shape to cut for sandwiches.  It was DELICIOUS.  This beats every white bread recipe I've tried in flavor and texture, and it was so easy.  It's a keeper for me.  Thanks!

I would just like to say this bread is not "ready in 45min" as the recipe states.  It takes 45min plus 1.5 hrs of rise time.  Most other recipes include the rise time in the total time.  I was in a hurry when I chose this recipe and didn't take a close enough look to notice so we ended up having a very late dinner.  The bread turned out beautiful, my husband really liked it although I prefer it to be a little chewier and a little "crustier".

A lot of the reviews said they ended up with a dense bread, as did I.  I followed the directions to a "t" but it could partially be because I had to use 1 Cup of whole wheat flour (ran out of regular) but others stated they did the same and their bread came out fine.  Mine was dense and crumbled when I cut it or tried to smear something on it.  So, I mashed my goat cheese on each "slice" and topped with sun-dried tomatoes and I have to say, it was a TASTY crumbly mess!  Will try a different recipe next time, rather then try to figure out what to do differently with this one.

This was the first loaf of bread I have ever kneaded by hand.  I doubled the ingredients so that could make two large baguettes.  I started making this in my kitchenaid, but during the kneading process it really started to groan, not wanting to cause any damage to be beloved machine I decided to continue by hand.  The dough did feel a lot more dense than any other bread dough I have made, but I am no expert.  I was a little concerned when the baguettes were on the baking tray, as they had not risen quite as much as I expected, I decided to put in the over anyway.  I need not have worried the bread was just the right size when it came out and the bread made beautiful sandwiches, the inside was just perfect.  I was a little disappointed that the crust was not as crunchy as expected, and to be honest a little soft.  It was still a good baguette, I will just have to master my own technique on how to make the bread as crusty as the baguettes I was brought up on in France!

Perfect. I added a pan of hot water to the oven in order to add humidity and give a crispier crust, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly with terrific results. This will be a staple recipe.

This is a great recipe! I think the denseness of the bread has alot to do with the humidity outside and the quality of the water used to bloom the yeast in. I'm in Memphis now but back in Louisiana the humidity there makes for some crusty and light french bread great for PoBoy sandwiches. This recpe went perfect with a bowl of french onion soup!!!

Very basic, easy, and good french bread.  the name seemed to be a misnomer to me.  I didn't brush it with the egg yolk and water mixture, and the crust browned beautifully but it's very soft.  I'd think that water in the oven would help it be crusty though.  And no complaints here as the recipe was spot on for a standard french loaf.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure what may have happened but my bread took over 24 hours to finally rise.  Which is interesting considering it was over 100 degrees here.  I eventually placed the dough outside to get it to rise.  It was salty when I finally made the bread.

I wasn't quite sure what consistency the dough needed to be before baking, and I think I should've kneaded it some more.  I was hoping for a nice baguette-style loaf, but it spread out a little bit and didn't get the crunch I was looking for, even with the egg wash.  Of course, that could be because I'm a novice at bread making.  I also cut down on the sugar and used just 1 Tbs, but it was still a bit sweet.

This is great bread!  I cut the sugar down to about 1 T. as I don't like overly sweet breads.  And I disagree with the top reviewer about the great importance of exact flour measurement and kneading time.  Years ago I was told that for all your basic bread recipes, you only need to keep adding flour and kneading until it's the right consistency - somewhat tacky and pliable but not sticking all over your hands.  When it's gets to the right consistency, you're done with both the flour and the kneading.  I read that review and chose to stick to my method and it still turned out perfectly.  Just delicious!  Don't stress yourself out over it! :)

I followed this recipe exactly, and while I think the bread turned out as intended, it wasn't quite what I expected.  It was much more dense, moist, and sweet than I expected for French bread, and the crust was pretty soft.  It did give me the confidence to try more breads, and I will try others to find a taste I like better.  This is definitely not a bad recipe, just not the flavor and texture I had in mind.

This was amazing.  Right before it was done baking I brushed with melted butter and italian seasoning.  I had to take half of it to a neighbors house or I would have eaten it all myself.  THANK YOU for giving me confidence in making bread.

I am not much of a bread maker, but I got to say this was the best bread I have ever made. The only thing I did different was I used bread flour and I didn't use the egg wash,I brushed the bread with melted butter before I put it in the oven and 5 min. before it was done. YUM!

I love this recipe. This is the first loaf of bread I ever made. It turned out great. The only tip would be to watch it when you bake it. My baking time was quite a bit less than the recipe called for. But now I know. We make this with spaghetti and it is awesome.

I made this in my bread machine set on dough.  Turned out great! The only problem I had was when I brushed on the egg white it flattened out my bread and it didn't recover.  But it tasted wonderful!  I am making it again now and I'll probably try baking it halfway then brush on the egg white.  Perfect for soup!  I made large rolls with it, sliced them in half after baking, and had French Dips.  Just perfect bread for dipping!

The only thing I did different was to eliminate the second rising because of time constraints and I split it up into two loafs because I was making Philly sandwiches. I didn't find this to be too dense at all.  I will be making this quite often to use for sandwiches.

Thank you for the recipe!  This was an easy bread to make.  The crust was very crispy, but the bread was dense.  Before I baked the bread I sprayed olive oil on the dough.  I will definitely make this again.

I have NEVER made homemade bread before and I was sure i would botch this up, but-WOW!  This bread is awesome! It comes out perfectly and the recipe was easy to follow, plus has simple ingredients.  I did make 2 smaller baguettes, instead of one long one, as I was baking on a pizza stone. It took all my willpower not to eat the entire thing myself! They even looked beautiful. 
Thanks so much for sharing this recipe- what an encouragement for me to know i can bake my own french bread!

Very disappointing.  I proofed the yeast first and it was fine, however, it too forever for the bread to rise--so long we couldn't have it with dinner.  The loaf was too flat and the flavor and texture were just so so.  I had expected a crunchy crust, but it was chewy instead.  I would not even fool with the recipe to try to improve it; there are too many other good bread recipes on the site.

As a novice Bread baker; I really enjoyed this recipe.  It came out great-tho' not quite as high as I would've liked.  Tasted great.  Used 2T Extra virgin olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, and used Kosher salt.  Was pleased with my first attempt. Definitely happy for a "first-timer"!

What a forgiving recipe! My daughter baked this for her first try at a yeast bread. She made some mistakes (too much flour, then too much water, didn't activate the yeast, etc.)and it still came out nearly perfect! The texture was just a tad too dense but it looked beautiful and tasted fine. Nice, golden crust. I read saw on Food Network that bakers toss in ice cubes in the oven to create steam. It worked wonderfully, and she's very proud! Thanks!

Not ready in 45 minutes! :) Have to allow for the rising time(s). Wish I would have read more closely, so I would have had it ready with dinner. Tasted okay, but still missing "something" that I haven't been able to find yet in any recipe. The crust came out very nice, though, better than any others I have tried yet. I will make again, but try to find that "taste" I am looking for because I do like the texture alot. Thanks!

Update 9/29/10: I now love this bread. I let it have first rise 30-60 mins, depending on how quickly it goes...omit second rise. Shape and place in oven (no heat) 30-45 mins, then bake. After first 5 mins, I place tray of ice cubes beneath, and after 5-10 mins brush with butter. Crust is perfect, inside is soft. It absolutely is bakery quality. I can't believe it is so simple. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is the first time I've made French Bread (& only the 2nd time I've made homemade bread). It was a simple recipe to follow and made delicious bread that my husband, daughter & I loved! Thank you!
