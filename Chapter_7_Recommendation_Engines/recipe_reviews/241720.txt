Perfect pot pie? Umm no. Not even close. Three stars without changes. I followed the recipe exactly, using an herb seasoned stuffing, but could tell this would be seriously under seasoned if left alone. The filling absolutely needs more than salt and pepper as seasoning. I tasted the filling first (a good cook is a good taster) and then decided to tweak it. Adding 1/2 tsp each sage, savory, roasted minced onion, and 1/4 tsp roasted garlic granules bumped it to 3.5 stars. This is a unique concept, but it's not a repeat recipe for me.
