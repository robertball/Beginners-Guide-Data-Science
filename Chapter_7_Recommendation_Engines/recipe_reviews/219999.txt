These were not bad at all. I just don't prefer the sweet taste as opposed to a deviled egg. The other problem that I encountered was that the filling was so soft that I could not pipe it very well to hold any shape.

These were delicious!  I usually just wing it without a recipe but decided to look for ideas.  I used garlic aioli for the creamy salad dressing. Yum!
