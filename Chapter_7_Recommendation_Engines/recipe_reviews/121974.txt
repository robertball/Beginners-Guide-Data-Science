Add the soy sauce and pineapple juice!!  This is fantastic, but I took the advice of another reviewer and added 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 2 tbsp. pineapple juice (from the pineapples).  Also, I sauteed the chicken breasts in about 1/4 cup olive oil until they were cooked to a golden brown--sort of crispy, with seasoning salt and pepper sprinkled liberally on each side of the chicken breasts to add flavor.  Once the chicken was cooked, I shredded it and mixed it with other ingredients and cooked it as directed.  Everyone LOVED it!!!!  I will definitely make this again.

I followed someone else's advice and added soy sauce and pinapple juice (both a tbsp). I would have mixed all of the wet ingredients before adding the chicken.  I also added two cups of fresh broccoli and it was really good.

Very good. I made the recipe and added the soy sauce and pineapple juice.  My husband liked it only wanted some more flavor on the chicken so next time I might season the chicken first or maybe even bread the chicken.  Thank you for the recipe.

This a great recipe that is quick and easy.  I added green pepper and onion chunks, extra water chestnuts (because I love them!), 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 2 table spoons of the drained pineapple juice to make it a little saucier.  Adding the soy sauce really makes this dish great!!!

This is one of my, and my husbands favorite quick meals.  It can be made ahead and frozen too.  It is flavorful, easy, and is great for using up left over chicken or turkey.  We eat it regularly.

Saw other reviews and did the soy sauce thing too. Believe it or not, the twins liked it! Must have been because it was a bit sweet. My wife and I enjoyed this dish.

This didn't taste exactly like take out chinese, but it fit the bill for what I was looking for.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added soy sauce and pineapple juice.  Served it with white rice.  Will make again.

I made this recipe and my husband and I both loved it.  He said there was one thing missing and when I questioned him he said cashews.  That would be a wonderful addition and will add cashews next time.

I had almost everything on hand for this recipe -- I didn't have water chestnuts, but it still tasted great!  I used chicken breasts and cut them in half instead of using the cubed, cooked chicken.  My husband liked it, too! Would definitely fix again!

My family loved this!  I have to admit, at first I was a little skeptical about the apricot jelly and chicken soup, but it was so good!  I always say it, but I hate changing a recipe before trying it, but I did.  I added red peppers and sugar snap peas.  I think a number of different veggies could be added if you wanted to, but it certainly would be great without them!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very easy meal!  I boiled the chicken breasts and heated the sauce in a separate sauce pan and eliminated the oven altogether.  Like others, I added 2 packets of soy sauce (leftover from takeout Chinese food) and used fresh cut pineapple with the juice.  Also, added a red bell pepper.  It made a lot of sauce for 2 big chicken breasts so next time I will cook more chicken and freeze half of it.  Served with steamed broccoli on the side.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but was disappointed due to the lack of flavor.  We thought it was very bland even with the suggested addition of the juice & soy sauce. Very easy to make, but of the 5 of us, no one voted it a keeper.

Made this as written and to be honest, if I had more energy today, I would've tossed this and made something else. The textures just didn't do it for me and it was WAY to sweet for me! I'm pretty sure there will be alot of leftovers from this. Sorry, but I doubt I'll try this one again.
