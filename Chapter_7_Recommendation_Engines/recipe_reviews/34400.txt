This definitely is an "Awesome Turkey Sandwich"! I used whole grain bread and Hellman's light mayo. I left out the bean sprouts and opted for some smoked bacon instead. I used Swiss cheese vs. Monterey Jack and OMG - this was really good! Perfect for lunch with a dill pickle on the side...

I changed this sandwich a little because I wanted a hot sandwich.  So, I left off the lettuce and bean sprouts.  I made it on a half ciabbata loaf for my husband and I.  I usually don't like mustard on sandwiches but I enjoyed the dijon on this.  I spread it very lightly on my side though.  I left off the guac, but put on extra avocado slices, after it came out of the oven.  Used light mayo.  Baked at 400 for 8-9 minutes.

I thought this was so good - I put the sandwich together as written, but divided the stuff between the two slices of bread, with the cheese on top and then broiled it open-faced. I put the halves back together before serving. Yum! My husband didn't want me to 'waste' time broiling it (because he was starving - aren't they always?), but couldn't stop saying 'Oh my God, this is so good!' while he was eating it. That's a good sign, I think ;-) I have also done this on a croissant - awsome! I'm making this again tonight for dinner, and I will continue to broil before eating. Thanks for the great post!

while this may taste delish i hardly think 50+ grams of fat w/ 20 of them being saturated can hardly be considered healthy!

I'm on a mission to eat healthy so this recipe fit perfectly into my new meal plan. I left out the extra avocado (aka fat) by omitting the guacamole. I also used a little light miracle whip instead of a whole tablespoon of mayonnaise. And I made the sandwich into a wrap using a high fiber multi grain "flat-out" flatbread. It tastes too good to be so healthy!

Avacado, Turkey, Tomato sounds yummy but my tastebuds did not agree...I thought it tastes better w/out avacado.

Very good sandwich, and healthy too.  I don't like sprouts, so I omitted them.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Thanks for the post.

Love this sandwich! Have made several times since finding recipe two weeks ago. The variations are endless and the taste...fantastic! I highly recommend this easy to make sandwich.

I made this sandwich using swiss instead of colby-jack. I  also skipped the salad greens, using only the sprouts instead. This is also good with a Thousand Island type dressing or sandwhich spread or as is (with the mayo/mustard combo and a thin layer of jellied cranberry sauce added! Mmmm...delish!

Amazing recipe. I used Italian bread, which goes great with the sandwich when cold.  I am going to make the guacamole spicier next time.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I had all the ingredients but the sprouts. Instead of guacamole I just used sliced avacado. I also used a different low fat cheese and lite mayo. I thought the mustard amount was excessive and cut that in half. It made for a filling sandwich for lunch today.

This is an awesome sandwich, great for lunch, or a lazy evening when cooking isn't an option. One of my favorite healthy choices.

These sandwiches are really good.  Depends a lot on the quality of the guacamole.
