It doesn't taste sweet enough, the cocoa powder is really strong. I added another tablespoon of  powdered sugar and butter and another 1/4 tsp of vanilla.

To recap:
6 Tbsp butter
6 Tbsp cocoa powder
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup plus 1 Tbsp powdered sugar

Delicious! I needed a quick, tasty, chocolate glaze for the orange chocolate Bundt cake on this site. I wanted a chocolate and orange glaze, and chose this one as it's made with stuff I stock anyway. but, I used OJ in place of the water, and wow! Very pretty, very tasty.

I wanted a bundt cake glaze that was pourable, like a ganache, but I didn't have the heavy cream. I opted for this glaze because I had the ingredients, and I'm glad I did because it's delicious! I'd increase the hot water to a range of 2-4 tablespoons, using less water for glazing brownies, donuts or cookies and more water for glazing cakes.

I've made it several times, and every time the fluid separated from the glaze and the glaze became lumpy. I love the taste, but maybe doing something wrong?

I looked at many chocolate glaze recipes. I chose this one because I had all of the ingredients on hand. It is simple to make, tastes wonderful, to me, using the exact ingredients called for in the recipe. I made a 1/2 recipe of an old family-favorite scratch chocolate cake (a recipe my mom got from a friend back in the mid-1960’s), in a 9X9 pan. The glaze was exactly enough to generously cover the top of the cake. I tasted the glaze before putting it on my cake, and I just loved the flavor. Great recipe. Thank you!

Chocolate-y with just the right amount of sweetness. Would consider another teaspoon of hot water to make it a bit more pourable. Made it for the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III on this site.

At one point it seemed to get lumpy and weird, but a little more hot water loosened it back up.  It's nice that the sweetness and consistency can be adjusted. I used this on a cake I wanted glazed, not frosted, and it was perfect. Saving for future use!

I doubled the powdered sugar and added more hot water. I added a dash of salt and beat vigorously with a whisk until satin smooth. Very chocolaty, shiny and delicious. Drizzled over a chocolate chip Bundt cake. Decadent!

This was so delicious! I do have to say though that I ended up putting a bit more powdered sugar than it called for because I wanted it a bit sweeter. Excellent recipe though, and the cake didn’t last long! lol
