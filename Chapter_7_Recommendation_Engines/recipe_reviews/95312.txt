As traditionally prepared Sea-Pie is quite tasty. This was and continues to be a staple of sailors & seafarers.  

Sea-pie was & is essentially a layered meat pie made with meat or fish, and is known to have been served to American & British sailors during the 18th century.  As a sailor I have enjoyed this dish on occasion.

In Quebec this dish is called cipaille, cipâtes or six-pâtes (in French), and is a traditional Quebec dish. The French name originated as an adaptation of sea-pie.

Authentic to what we're used to eating in Northern Ontario, Canada. Turned out just like my hubby's mémère (grandma) used to make!
