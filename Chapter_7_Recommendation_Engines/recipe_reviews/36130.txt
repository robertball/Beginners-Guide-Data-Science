Good and simple. Since I vegetarianized this, I used textured soy and two 'beef' bullion. Also added one carrot and two stalks of celery. I would recommend serving with a dollop of sour cream on top. Also, save yourself the dishes and use only one pot- add ingredients in this order: celery, carrots, potatoes, then beets so that they are all equally as soft. Borscht shouldn't feel chunky, but rather melt in your mouth.

This was a very good soup. My grandson, who lived in Ukraine as a young child, loved it. My suggestions: using vegetable broth in place of the water and including 2 cups of grated cabbage when adding the beets to the meat and broth. I really appreciated the simplicity of using canned beets in this recipe.

I added some fresh thinly sliced cabbage towards the end of the cooking process or if you are adventurous add sauerkraut it gives it a lot of good flavor. Additionally there is no need to cook in 2 separate pots. I just cooked the meat first (strain the water, skim the fat) then add the potatoes and rest of the veggies. I only used 3 medium potatoes. For additional flavor I added beef base (i use organic). You HAVE to eat borsh with sour cream, it brings out the flavor. I grew up eating borsh and now I make it at least once a month.

Nice simple recipe.   I added dill for authentic flavor an used precooked roast to me it in an hour.   Wish I'd found this ages ago!
