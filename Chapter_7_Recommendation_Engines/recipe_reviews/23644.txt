THIS CAN BE MADE WITHOUT USING A BREAD MACHINE.  I love trying different dough recipes and this is my favorite!  If making without a bread machine, add yeast, sugar, and water (105-115 degrees) and let bud for 10 minutes.  Add EVOO, and 1 cup flour and stir.  Add second cup of flour w/the salt(salt directly added to yeast can kill it)  It was more like a batter with the second cup but I didn't use bread flour, using A-Purp. unbleached flour instead(read a review for a chewier crust use unbleached and it works well)  I took the 1/2 cup and poured the dough onto a board and kneaded it in but needed more flour so probably added another 3/4 cup.  I guess I got so nervous w/the consistency of the dough at first that I forgot to add the herbs/garlic.  I wasn't worried since it did have sugar/salt/EVOO in the crust.  I let it rise in warm place for 1 hour. It rose nicely! Punched down and let it rest for 5 minutes.  Rolled it out into pan and didn't prebake or anything..just proceeded from there.  The crust is how I like it personally; chewy and just a nice brown. It had the best flavor even without the herbs.  I can't imagine how good it is w/adding the herbs!  Will make again.

This could be a good recipe, but what ruins it is the fact that the amount of flour is woefully inadequate. I was in a hurry and ended up having to take the time to add flour to the 'finished' dough, which was a gooey, sticky mess. Messy and time-consuming to try to fix it so it could be usable.

We have been on a homemade pizza craze here. I have tried 3 pizza crusts from this site so far. This one was good---but it was a little too sweet I thought! Might cut down on the sugar next time? It did make a beautiful crust, very 'deep dish' like. Also, I baked at 400 and it was fine. Came out very nice.

This pizza crust is soooo good!!   I like to make homemade pizza because it is healthier for the kids.  Store-bought dough and sauce has high fructose corn syrup in it.  I have tried different recipes, but it is hard to find a crust that tastes great when just baking from your own oven with a metal pizza pan!  I had settled for an OK recipe when I came across this one, I will never go back!  My bread machine has an hour and thirty minutes dough setting.  I just sprinkled in the spices when it started to mix and left it on through the whole cycle. I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and ran out of bread flour so used 1 cup of all purpose flour.  I baked it at 425 degrees and baked for about 4 min. before adding the toppings.  I sprayed the pizza pan with olive oil cooking spray and made a simple sauce with tomato sauce and a little paste with a little italian seasonings, pinch of sugar, pepper, grated parm. and garlic salt.  There was so much flavor in the crust, I didn't want to  overpower with the sauce. All the flavors blended perfectly.  Thank you so much for sharing Ricardo!  This is the crust I will use from now on!

Very good crust.  I must say that my favorite crust uses a sponge-starter...takes a total of 3 days to make and is well worth the effort!  However, this is a quick alternative that I use in a pinch.  I have a tip for "MIHAELA" who said his crust won't slide easily off his peel...use parchment paper!  Take a piece large enough to fit your stone (and pizza), spray it with a little cooking spray, and then make your pizza right on the parchment.  Pull the parchment rather quickly to get it on your peel and then slide the whole thing on your stone...you may need to use your hand to pull at the back corner of the parchment to get it on the stone.  When the pizza is finished, slide your peel under the pizza (minus the parchment)...you may need to put on an oven mit to help push the pizza on the peel.  Then, just take the parchment out of the oven and throw it away!  Easy and problem-free!!!  I hope this helps.

This is the perfect amount of dough for a large pizza pan making a thin crust in the middle and nice medium thick edges. I decreased the sugar to 1 TB and it was the best I have ever made and I have made lots! Baked it 6 minutes on the lowest rack possible before adding other ingredients. Kept it on low rack to help ensure crispy crust. This is a must try. For those having yeast problems: Bury your yeast in the middle of your flour without letting it touch the liquid. It will work.

Very tasty recipe. I added a little parmesan to the dough and it was great. Maybe a quarter cup.

This is the first pizza base recipe I have tried to make from scratch in my bread machine and it was so easy to do, won't try another. Cut the sugar down to 1.5 tablespoons as recommended and didn't find it too sweet but made the crusts tasty. Also used 6g yeast as that is the size packets you get here in the UK, rose well. Topped with the sauce from the "Pizza Sauce and Dough" recipe, mozzarella, chili peppers and mixed veggies which worked really well. Came out slightly soggy in the centre of the base using a baking (cookie?) tray so have invested in a pizza stone and will blind bake for 5-8 mins prior to topping. Brushed the edges with olive oil before baking and came out lovely, golden and crisp.

I must say this is one of the best crusts I have tried off this site.  I did change it up a little.  I added 2 tsps of garlic powder instead of the minced Garlic, and also added a heaping 1/4 cup of Parmesan Cheese to the dough in the bread machine.  I pre-baked the crust in a 425 oven for 6-7 minutes, then topped with sauce, pepperoni, and cheese, and baked for an additional 12-13 minutes.  Will definitely make again!!  Thanks Richard!!

I love the taste of the herbs in this.  I reduced the sugar by 1 tbs. but would either reduce more or leave it out completely next time.  It yielded two pizzas.  The only thing is that my oven is electric... I don't know why but even though I set the timer for only 12 minutes the first one burned.  The second one was better.  We liked it a lot.

My husband and I were buying our crust from a local pizzeria and then making the pizza at home...until we tried this recipe.  It is incredible!  We make it without the added garlic (because we have it already in the sauce (Easy Pizza Sauce) and I'm too lazy.  Truly a #1 recipe.  Thank you!!

This crust was delicious! I was able to put lot of toppings without the dough getting soggy like some of the other pizza dough recipes I've tried from here. The dough rises very nicely to give a thick crispy crust.

Great dough for calzones. I added rosemary to the mix and it was delicious. Next time will try parmesan per another user's suggestion.

Good but would not say it was fantastic, the dough was extremely easy to handle, but I just found the cooked base to be far to fluffy and light.  Our family preference is for a much more crusty rustic base. Very easy recipe just not quite what I am looking for.

This is a wonderful pizza crust recipe.  My family never liked my homemade pizza until I tried this recipe.  It is very soft but also crispy on the outside.  I used regular flour and I prebaked the crust for about 10 minutes.  Delicious!

The best! This is easy to make in the bread machine and tastes great. I use this recipe every time I make pizza. I bake it at 425 or 450 and definitely don't have to pre-bake the crust.

We use this recipe  every time we make pizza. I bake it at 400 for 15 minutes to keep the crust on the softer side. Also, I butter the edges of the pizza after it comes out of the oven as it cools, to make it look and taste even better!

I've made several pizza doughs in the bread machine and this one is my favorite!  I followed it to a T.  I searched Allrecipes for a recipe that had more sugar in it because I believe a good pizza crust needs it.  Its not a sweet dough by any means but the sugar off-sets the herbs and garlic beautifully.  This recipe is a nice, thick crust and has a great consistency.  The only thing I do differently with ALL my dough recipes is put the warm water (160 degrees), the sugar and yeast in the bread machine and let it sit for 10 minutes before putting the rest of the ingredients in and starting the dough cycle.

All I can say is WOW!  We were so amazed on how awesome this recipe came out.  I let the dough do its thing in the bread machine for the full 1 hr 30 min cycle,took it out then punched it down and kneaded a bit on a floured board, let rise for 40 more min. then transferred to a oiled bowl for storage (had to make 2 batches and take across the street).  We then put the dough directly on the un-warmed pizza stones (very hard to transfer once prepared) and baked at 425 for around 20 min (watch them!).  It was wonderful- will never buy pizza already made again!

I have been making pizza crusts lately.  This one is better than some.  Very tasty and the crust is thick.  I followed one review with making the dough by hand instead of the machine.  Thanks Ricardo for your secret formula...

I have been trying many different recipes for pizza crusts that can be made in the bread machine.  This one is so good!  Not only the taste, but the texture and it is so easy to handle and work with!  I added 2 cloves of garlic for my teaspoons, but may add an additional clove next time or garlic powder, just because I love garlic so much.  I just keep coming back to this recipe each time I make pizza now.  My search I think is over for my medium crust pizza!!

I did not use a bread maker (because I don't own one), just made it by hand, and it turned out fabulous! This crust was so amazing and flavorful that truly you could eat it plain without any pizza toppings. I made a chicken and arugula pizza with crunchy dried tomatoes and a mix of cheddar and blue cheese. It really was a good mix with this crust.

A wonderful dough recipe! It's very flavourful and chewy and brought kudos from my non-pizza eating husband! Definitely a keeper. Thanks, Richard, for posting the recipe!

Good but I'm still looking for great.  The pizza tastes better reheated on the stove in a covered frying pan, the bottom of the crust gets crispy and it doesn't get soggy.

I don't think I will ever try any other pizza crust for my bread machine...this one is perfect. The crust comes out so good every time and just has the perfect amount of flavor.

I love this recipe! I had a hard time rolling it out as it was "springy", so after rolling to about the right size i pushed it into the pan. I made "stuffed crust" putting string cheese along the edges and rolling the dough edges over them. I did not bake the dough first; at 425 the edges ended up getting crispy while the middle was still doughy. Next time: I will bake the crust 5-8 minutes before adding the toppings, and keep the oven at 425. I would also replace 1/2 cup flour with whole wheat flour. The sugar level seemed fine to me. After opening my bread machine, the strong garlic smell had me worried... but once baked it was perfect.

Really good pizza dough; crispy crust, soft inside, very thick.  First time making in the bread machine.  Wanted to try without the herbs first and it still had good flavour.  Left dough in machine for full "dough cycle", then let it rest for 10 min.  Baked at 425 degrees like other reviewers suggested.  Will definitely make again, and next time w/all the herbs.

I love this recipe.  It made the perfect pizza.  We didn't roll it out as thin as we should've, so it was thicker....but still very good.  This one's a keeper!  I think I may very well try to make these as breadsticks, too.

This pizza crust was very good.  I ended up making 2 strombolis for me and my husband and a small pizza for my son and everyone just loved it.  I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks!

This is a good crust with nice herby-garlic flavor.  The only change I made was to prebake the crust for about 4-5 minutes before I put the sauce and toppings on.

Delicious!  We loved this dough....it is sooo yummy.  I also like to make my pizza on a peel and then slide it onto a preheated pizza stone.  This dough is very soft and makes that next to impossible.  Anyone have any suggestions?

This makes a very good crust.  Raises nice and light and has good flavor.  It made enough for 2 pizzas the size of my small baking stone.  Very Good, will use this crust often. I made one pizza and bread sticks with the leftover dough, they were good also!  Thanks.

This is awesome!  I filled it with salami, mozzerella, broccoli (sauteed it first with olive oil, Italian seasoning and garlic) and leftover spaghetti sauce.  Then, I folded it over and baked it.  It was the yummiest thing I have eaten in ages.

The first time I made his pizza crust, I had the same issue as another reviewer with it being very soft and almost runny.  I kneaded in some cornmeal to save the batch and it tasted fine. The only thing I could figure that I had done "wrong' was using regular flour vs bread flour.  I made it again tonight and added an additional 1/4 cup all purpose flour (I never have bread flour on hand) and it turned out perfect.  I let the bread machine do all the work and then stretched the dough out onto a very large nonstick cookie sheet covered with a fine layer of cornmeal.  I didn't prebake my crust.  I just topped with the usual (bbq sauce, shredded bbq chicken and extra mozzarella for us) and baked at 375 for 15 minutes. Sheer perfection.  :)

Homemade pizza has been a family favorite for years.  I misplaced our recipes and have been trying new crusts....this has become our new favorite.  The texture is fantastic and the garlic gives it a sweetness that most other recipes lack.  I would make the crust to eat alone, it's that good.

This pizza dough was very easy to make and it came out of the bread maker easily and was ready to go. However, I think I was pampered with the New York Italian Pizza Dough on this site, because the flavor did not meet expectations. I think the difference was that the New York one lets the dough roll around in 2 tbs oil, rather than baking it into the dough. I'll be sticking with the other recipe, takes a bit more work, but the flavor of the crust is beyond worth it.

Awesome pizza crust but too sweet.   2nd time I made it I only used 1 tsp sugar and 2 tbsps olive oil and it was perfect.  I also didn't mix the spices in with my crust and used it as part of the toppings instead.  Most importantly I baked mine on the bottom rack at 400F.  My oven cooks fast.  I don't have a bread machine and this dough came in no time.  I sometimes cut the dough in half to make 2 smaller thin crust pizzas.  Perfect!  Thanks for posting.  My go to pizza crust from now on. 

P.S.  I own a pizza peel.  I had the same problem.  I may try adding some cornmeal to the peel (after dusting the peel with flour.) Update from 2018... I now use 1/2 whole wheat flour and 2 cups of bread flour.  Also use a cast iron pan.  New oven and still cooks fast from the bottom. So cook time has changed and position also but outcome is delicious.  Love the texture the little bit of whole wheat adds.

Family loves the recipe.  If you wanted a thin crust, you could use the rest of the dough for breadsticks.  Followed the recipe and let stand 30 minutes after the mixing part and also let cook about 5 minutes before adding the sauce and toppings.

Made this with Barbeque Chicken and Red Onion pizza recipe as the topping.  So very delicious!  I cut the sugar to 1 Tbs.  Turned out a little sticky (I think because it sat in the bread machine for a little bit extra after the dough cycle had ended).

We make homemade pizza a lot and I recently came across this recipe for the dough and its a huge hit.  Its basically fool-proof if you use the bread machine and you can prep your toppings while the machine does the hard work!  Because I think the crust is the best part of the pizza, we brush olive oil all around the edges and sprinkle garlic powder and kosher salt.  Amazing.  PS - I use regular old all purpose flour every time and have had no problems :)

The first homemade crust that I actually am completely happy with! Was able to roll it very thin--used this recipe for our grilled pizzas and when they came off the grill it was crunchy in all the right ways! I do not have a bread machine so I had to do some tinkering--and clean my kitchen after I was done! Without the bread machine I needed probably about a cup extra of flour to knead in--but it was delicious!

I have tried many bread machine pizza crust recipes and this is my new favorite.  I didn't have any of the problems that others complained about as far as sticking.  This dough was the easiest dough I have ever handled.  It rolled out beautifully without tearing at all. It cooked up perfectly.  Next time I will follow others suggestions and use a little less sugar.  My only criticism is that I think it would be good if the dough had a slightly more buttery taste.  Other than that it is perfect!  Made this again and used it for Stromboli.  Used about 1.5 Tbsp sugar, otherwise followed the recipe.  I did leave it in the frig wrapped up for about an hour before using it.  It was the best stromboli I've ever made.  Nice and fluffy, but not too dense.

I heeded other reviewers advice, and only did 1/3 of the sugar called for. Turned out great!! I was surprised how good it was! I want to try using this recipe for rolls next time!

This pizza crust was great! I like to make my pizza on cookie sheets rather than a pizza pan. The trouble with that is usually the recipe for pizza dough isnt enough and it comes out like a thin crust pizza almost everytime. This dough turned out huge once i let it rise! Cant wait til it's done baking =)

Great recipe!  I used half wheat flour and mixed by hand.  I only let it rest 20 minutes, then shaped breadsticks and let rest another 10 minutes.  I baked them for 10 minutes.  They turned out fantastic!  Next time I will brush the tops with a little olive oil and garlic for the last 2 minutes, and they'll be perfect!

I thought I would tune in to see where the comments stood.  I appreciate your continued good reviews of the recipe.  A few comments:  Yes the crust can be divided into two for thin crust medium pizzas.  If the dough is gooy, you should try adding a little more flour until the dough forms a ball.  That's basic dough making.  And for all those who have added, taken away and modified the crust that's wonderful.  

My son likes less sugar, so halve it if you are like him.

YEAST--use only instant or pizza yeast, not rapid rise.  I found that they work differently

We will refer to those changes as the Ascent of Man.    Ricardo

Impressive Crust!! I used this with the BBQ Chicken Calzone recipe and it was to-die-for!! I did add some Parmesan to the dough and used a stand mixer to do the grunt work (dissolving yeast & sugar in H20 first). Baked on a stone; no problems with sticking... this guy's a keeper!

One of the better pizza crust recipes on this site.  I used a garlic and herb infused olive oil that further enhanced the flavor.  I love that the recipe calls for minced garlic.  I pre-baked for 5 minutes before adding toppings.  As another reviewer suggested, don't overload your pizza as this unfavorably impacts the final result; something I need to learn every time I make one!  Next time, I'm going to use less dough for a thinner crust.  When I pressed it out, it looked like it was going to be just the way we like it, but it puffs up during baking.  All in all, a great recipe, so thank you for posting!

Love this recipe. Like to make my own pizzas, more healthy. If you use bread yeast in the jar, only 1 tsp is needed. My son between jobs worked in a pizzeria and works the dough for me, loves the way this handles! If using a stone perhaps cornmeal on the base would let it slide easier.  Also too much veggies and cheese can make the crust soggy (another tip from my son). We love a thin crust and this really fills the bill. My favorite now!!!!

Great dough recipe!  We had it with homemade pesto (frozen from last summer), ground turkey and goat cheese.  I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour and added a couple extra tablespoons of bread flour (the dough was looking very wet in the machine).  2 garlic cloves did it for me, and I'd agree the sugar could easily be cut down to 1-2 tablespoons.  Very nice and herb-y.  I'll make it again!

Wow! Absolutely beautiful!!This is the perfect crust for deep dish pizza. Pizza Hut look out! It is almost the same texture as theirs but definitely more flavorful due to the great blend of spices. My husband, who is a pizza critic, loves this and wouldn't have me change a thing. I forked the middle of the crust and precooked for 6 minutes then brushed with butter, garlic powder, and garlic pepper. Fabulous! Our new family favorite. Thank you!!!

This pizza crust is fantastic!!  I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been any happier.  The crust is a bit sweet but I found that to be a great contrast with some spicy sauce and pepperoni. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I have tried so many homemade pizza crusts, but this one is definitely the best!! So easy to make too. I made to medium size pizza's- one really thin, the other thicker. Both turned out great. This is the one I'll make from now on!!

My family loved this dough.  I've had hit or miss luck with homemade dough in the past, but this worked great.  It was so soft and chewy!  I pre-baked it 5 minutes at 425, and then 8 more minutes with the toppings on.  Next time I don't think I'll prebake it, as I think it would have been ok.  I can't wait to make this again!

We loved this. Used fresh garlic. Do not prebake and do not cook at 475 or it will burn. I reduced the temp after a few minutes and still the bottom was burned a little, oh well tasted great. we really liked the sugar and noted that some people didn't so add it and see what you think:) thanks for the recipe

Oh boy is this crust good! This is the best one that I have tried from this site so far!  It's crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside!  I'll be making this one a lot!  The only change I made was that I had to turn the oven down to 450 so it wouldn't burn.  Thanks for sharing!

I liked this crust as it was very easy to make via the breadmaker.  I will definitely make it again but without the sugar as I though the dough was too sweet for a pizza crust.

I LOVE this recipe. It is a favorite of the whole family, and I give it to everyone! I like to add more garlic and herbs for a stronger flavor, and I also found that I prefere mixing the dough in my Kitchen Aid rather than in a bread machine.

This is a nice flavored crust. I used half white and half wheat BM flour. I also doubled the recipe and ended up with three 12 inch crusts.  I probably should have ended up with four since they baked up so thick, remember to roll thin. This came out well for our pizza night but I am still on the look-out for the perfect pizza crust. Thanks :)

This recipe is a good base for a crust recipe.  It was okay, but nothing spectacular like the other reviews say.  This crust should definitely be pre-baked before adding the toppings.  I followed the directions and had a very doughy bottom of the crust, but very brown edges.  I had to bake another 15 minutes before it was edible.  I could hardly taste the garlic or the berbs.

This is the best pizza crust that I have ever made.  Thought it might have a bit too much garlic from the smell when I took it out of the bread machine, but it was absolutely perfect!  Great recipe!!!

This is my first homemade pizza crust and it turned out beautifully.  Very yummy.  Next time I'll double it and use the rest for breadsticks.  Very easy and very good.

Of course I would rate my own recipe a 5.  Thank you all for your kind remarks.  This note is a response to questions about placing the dough on a pizza stone.  I have done it by first cooking the dough on a pizza pan for 5 minutes or so then transfering it to the stone.  I'm open to a better idea myself.

Followed all the recommended amounts of ingredients, and  made by hand. I had to add a good amount of extra flour to get the dough drier. However ended up splitting the dough into two portions so I could eat one now and make one later this week. Pizza turned out great. Nice and fluffy but crispy on the outside

This is one of the best pizza dough recipes I have come across. I was able to easily convert the recipe for 50% more dough.  After the initial bread machine rise, I punched the dough down into a ball and let it rise for 30 more minutes in an oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap that had a few knife slits to allow it to breathe. I punched down the dough one more time and separated into two balls. After letting those rise for 15 more minutes, they were ready to stretch, top and bake. Very nice tasting crust with a good chew.

Made as directed, except  I used 1 tsp granulated garlic & added the herbs (also added 1/2 tsp.  lavender from my garden) on top of the flour. 

I brushed crust edges with olive oil to keep it from over cooking. Used convection oven at 450 for 12 mins. , but crust & cheese still got dark. Crust was very good & soft, but I would prefer it not be so dark.

This was my first time making pizza totally from scratch, so I'll turn the temp. down to 425 next time.

I made this by hand and it turned out great. My husband loved the spices. We have a very large pizza pan and it came out with an average thickness crust with a fairly thick border. Perfect for our pan but I would imagine very thick in a smaller size. It was crunchy on the outside, chewy inside, like a good bread should be. The dough was on the sticky side but I just kept my hands and surface lightly dusted with flour and it was fine.  My new go to recipe.

I have been looking for a good pizza crust recipe for a long time and have finally found it!  This recipe is excellent.  Flavor is great and recipe is simple.  I cut the sugar in half and it was plenty sweet enough.  Didn't use the bread machine.  Let dough rise for 90 minutes, punch down, rest for 20 minutes then roll it out.   I will be making this again!

Only used 1 tbl spoon sugar. Husband said it was the best pizza crust he had ever had! Makes great pan pizza.  We just buttered an 8in cake pan molded the dough in to the  bottom and half way up the side (like pie crust). This is our new pizza night crust.

Great pizza crust recipe! I have made this several times now . I think the reviewer who suggested letting the warm water and yeast interact for 10 minutes has saved my pizza crust! I have been using regular active dry yeast and didn't realize  this is a crucial step. Otherwise I love this recipe. I reduced the sugar to 1 2/3 Tablespoons and used fresh herbs: approximately 1 teaspoon oregano, 1 teaspoon basil, and about 1-2 tablespoons Rosemary. Otherwise the proportions are perfect. The dough comes out of the bread maker a bit sticky but just flour your hands, spray your pizza pan or stone with cooking spray and dust some extra flour on the dough as needed. Press it out, let it rise again, and voila!

This crust is really excellent. Browns nicely with a chewy center. I cut the sugar to 1.5 Tbsp but otherwise followed exactly. Dough had perfect consistency and rose quite a bit during the 30 minute rest period. Pats easily out into a pizza shape. ( I have yet to master the stretching method.) I will be making it again!

This is my go-to pizza crust! I make 2 batches (2 large pizzas) for our family of 6. I usually premake in the morning or day before and "par-bake" the crusts in a 375 degree oven for about 7-8 minutes, then they're ready to to top and bake at dinner time. (I added just a couple Tbsp. more flour to the bread machine while mixing, that is the only change). Awesome pizza crust!

I liked the taste and the consistency, but needs gentle tossing to keep from getting rips.Best to flatten out using knuckles and palms, or add 1/4 c. more flour.

i used this recipe about 6 months ago to make calzones, and it was great!  However, tonight I am using it for pizza...I prebaked for only 11 minutes and that was way too long.  It was on the verge of burning. I can't even cut the cooking time down because I put raw sausage on it.  Next time will cut prebaking in half.  BUT -- when made correctly this is a very good crust. 4 stars because it's missing something..can't place my finger on it.

I have made this three times now and I love it!  I have tried a couple different things after making it exactly as the recipe.  First, I omitted the sugar and used 2 TBS honey instead, and then I used half all-purpose flour half whole wheat flour.  Plus I use a pizza stone sprinkled with flour or corn meal when I cook it.  I just place the dough straight on the stone and shape how I'd like, then I put my pizza toppings on and bake it for 14-15 min.  It tastes great still, plus I love the corn meal on bottom!  Awesome pizza dough recipe!

My daughter is extremly picky when it come to pizza and she loved this pizza.  The only thing I found was that I needed to add a lot of extra flour so that it wouldn't be so sticky.

I had no bread machine after taking out of my mixer I found it was to wet and had to add flour and kneed until I got the right bread texture. I also Substituted brown sugar instead of white and cook it on 425 for 18 to 20 minutes, It was great.

When I read the recipe, I didn't think it was going to be anything special. I did mine for the entire one hour on dough cycle in the bread machine and left out the basil and oregano, baked it at 375 for 17 minutes. This crust was heavenly! Super soft and chewy. The garlic and sugar were perfect!

Everyone I've  made this for loves it! I use about half whole wheat bread flour and half white to increase the fiber value - even the kids love it.

Loved this!  Made as is in the breadmaker, but did have to precook before adding sauce and toppings. Have made this again, and substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for some of the bread flour.  A very delicious addition, and I think I will always swap it in.

this was a great recipe!  I made 2 medium sized pizzas baked it at 425 for the first 13 minutes then reduced it to 375 for the last 10-15 mins and the crust came out very crispy!  .but next time I'll drizzle olive oil on the crust after shaping it on the pizza pan, otherwise the crust is a bit dry for our liking.

Great recipe, however I found it a little bready. Maybe my fault. This was a perfect amount of dough to cover a cookie sheet for a thinner crust.

AWESOME! The flavor of this dough was spectacular, not to mention the smell of it as it was baking. Made as written, except for just throwing the oregano and basil right in at the beginning with everything else. This was truely yummy and very 'gourmet'. I will definately be using this recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Not bad but it definitely made a very thick pizza crust.  I'd probably cut this into 2 doughs next time. All around, not bad though.

Delicious! The first few times I made this, I used all-purpose flour, and sometimes mixed in some wheat flour, and it was pretty good. Maybe 4 stars. But, I made it last night with the bread flour and it really made the 5-star difference! So yummy! I'd recommend pre-baking the crust before you add the toppings. Just for 4 minutes or so.

Perfect bread maker pizza dough.  I added spices from an Italian seasonings bottle (which had oregano and basil).  We all had fun making individual pizzas with our own toppings.   Kid made hers in different shapes.

Great flavor! Easy too. The crust was beautiful and smelled so good! Ease up on the sugar a bit if you don't like your crust too sweet.

Made in bread machine using entire length of dough cycle and on a pizza stone.  Also baked the crust about 5 min. before adding toppings because of earlier reviewers saying their's was not done in the middle.  Came out very soft and bread-like.  Thick, soft crust with wonderful flavor.  Would not recommend if you're looking for a crispy, crunchy crust.  4 stars ONLY because I prefer a crust soft on the inside, but crunchy on the outside.  Any suggestions for achieving that?

Five stars doesn't do it justice!  I've had a lot of pizzas in my life but this just set a new standard.  Not only did I have Ricardo's Pizza Crust but also used his homemade secret sauce along with pepperoni, mushrooms, and lots of mozzarella...absolutely divine!  A keeper for sure!!!!!

great easy pizza crust.  turned out wonderful.  I did not use bread flour I just used regular flour and it turned out great.  The first time I made it I used it as a pizza crust, then the next day I used it to make garlic sticks.  Both tasted great.  The only change I will make next time I make it is to precook it for 5 or 10 minutes then take out and add toppings and finish cooking.

This was tasty and I love the ease of making it in the bread machine.  However, with my bread machine, I add the ingredients as recipe calls for:  let the primary ingredients mix about 10 minutes, then add the oregano and basil (plus a couple other italian seasonings...).

Best pizza dough I've made, I'm so glad I found this recipe. I baked the crust for a few minutes before adding the sauce.  I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and the other 2 cups of unbleached flour. I've made it both ways blended the two flours and with just the unbleached flour. Now if I can just find a good pizza sauce.

This was my 1st attempt at using a bread machine & making pizza dough from scratch. I made it exactly as stated. I didn't change a thing. It had such great flavor. I was very impressed. The crust rose nicely in the oven. The only thing I would mention is that I know oven temps vary and for my oven I think 475 deg is to high of a cooking temp for this dough. My cheese started browning and the edges of the pizza were done before my dough was completly cooked in the middle. The edges were perfect crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside but, the middle of the pizza dough was still a little raw. I will adjust this next time. Yes, I will definetly make again.

For the first time making my own pizza dough... this one was amazing.  Will definately use this recipe again!!!!  The dough was nice a light and the crust was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  Definately a keeper.

Excellent! Nice and crispy crust. I made it with 1/2 all purpose flour and half whole/mixed grain blend of flours. It came out great! I topped it with "exquisite pizza sauce" from this site and topped that with mixed vegetables and spinach. I placed it in a pre-heated oven at 500 degrees. After about 8 minutes, I took it out and sprinkled the top with cheese - this way the cheese would not burn while the dough was getting crisp. It's a keeper recipe!

Great flavor!  I used 50% white flour and 50% wheat.  Half of the dough was for making BBQ chicken calzones (delicious recipe on this site) and the other half was used for a traditional pizza.  It tasted perfect for both dishes.

This was great pizza crust!!  This was a hit with my family. The only thing I would recommend is to make sure you roll it out really thin.

This recipe produces the best pizza crust! My family just loved it. I used the same amount of sugar as written and do not find the crust to be too sweet. I omitted the dried herbs. I even save some dough and fried it to make fried dough sprinkled with sugar. Yummy, just like at the carnival, even better.

This was excellent.  I also added fresh basil and oregano and left out the sugar.  I used all whole wheat flour.  This is my new pizza crust recipe.

I'm sorry Ricardo, but as written this is not what I was expecting. 1st of all TOO MUCH SUGAR! Way too sweet...does not go with the savory flavors of the added garlic and herbs. Secondly, NOT ENOUGH FLOUR! We spent a good 15 minutes trying to get the sticky dough out of the bread machine pan. It did puff up quite a bit during baking so my advice is to roll thinLy unless you like a lot of dough with your pizza. I wouldn't mind trying this again with a fraction of the sugar and another cup or 2 of flour. EDIT: I read over the other reviews and am now questioning that maybe I did something wrong in the crust making process. That and the kids enjoyed their pizza. Okay...one more star. I guess maybe it was a personal taste thing. Still think it was way too sweet though.

This pizza dough recipe is the BEST recipe I have ever made. I have made it sooo many times. It is very easy to modify: sometimes I use 1 cup of Whole Wheat flour instead of all White flour, sometimes I omit the spices and have a plain crust, sometimes...well you get the idea!  It is an awesome recipe.

This is the best pizza ever!  My husband and 10 year old daughter tell me it is the best pizza they have ever eaten and always ask me to make it for them.  No more delivery for us!  I usually make it with a sautted onion and oregano topping, mozzarella and black olives.  It´s our family favorite.  When my daughter´s friends invite her for dinner and their moms make pizza, she tells them I make the best pizza ever.  The moms always ask for the recipe and after trying it, they all agree! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My favorite pizza dough recipe. Easy to adjust spices to taste. And if you replace 1/4 cup of the flour with white corn meal it gives the crust a bit more crispness. My families favorite addition to the dough is sliced garlic cloves (2-3 cloves is plenty garlickey with out being overwhelming).

Very good crust.  Soft and chewy, but a little sweet for my taste.  I'd cut the sugar to only 1-2 Tbsp.  Also, I had to add extra flour because it was extremely sticky.  Everybody liked it though!

I used my bread machine at full cycle and I never had such rave reviews on my crust. My son actually told me he wished I made the crust into bread stick instead of crust for pizza. My youngest took all the toppings off the pizza and just ate the crust. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This crust is perfect! I just got a bread machine, and until now have just been using boxed mixes. This blows those mixes out of the water! Yummy! I used it for the Rueben Pizza (yum!). I can't wait to try it with other toppings.

Excellent Pizza Crust, and usually turns out perfect, but I have messed it up once.  I was in a hurry to leave the house and only had half the amount of bread flour needed, so I used half bread flour and half unbleached white flour, and added the herbs in right away instead of waiting until after the first rising.  I'm not sure which of those changes did it, but it turned into a messy gooey disaster that I had to trash.  Thankfully I had time to make it again as directed and it turned out exactly right.

This was very good.  However, based on other reviews, I pre-baked the crust before adding toppings and it came out a little too crispy.  Next time, I won't pre-bake it.

Recipe came out very sticky and didn't rise very well.. after adding loads of cornmeal and flour, I was able to roll it out and add my toppings.  Turned out pretty good, though I'll definitely be experimenting with other recipes.

I'm so happy I tried this recipe...not disappointed at all.  I followed except for the spices. I have a ton of italian seasoning and used 1 tsp of that...after mixing for 30 mins I let rest for aprox 30 more..put olive oil on a cookie sheet..did not roll dough out..instead I just worked it into the pan with my fingers.  Topped with my best marinara sauce, grated parmesan and sliced provolone...so good!  I'm mixing up another batch right now....THX RICARDO!!

I have accepted the fact that I just can't do yeast. Because of this, it was a little tough. I don't have a bread machine so maybe that was it. It was flavorful, and despite my incompotence nice and bready at times. I used it with calzones. Next time I will decrease the sugar a little.

Best crust ever! I just threw all the ingredients in the bread machine and turned it on before we left for church. So it ran the whole 90 min. dough cycle, but that didnt seem to be a problem. I rolled it out and let it rise for about 10 minutes, then prebaked for 6 mins., loaded on the toppings, then baked for 6 more minutes.   Came out perfect.  Great thick, chewy crust.  We thought it was a tiny bit too sweet for us, so the only change will be to use a little less sugar. This will be our alltime favorite pizza crust recipe! 10 stars!

New owner of a used bread machine. Was sceptical, but this crust came out really good. Baked it on a pizza stone, with a LIGHT coating of tomato sauce, some copped green pepper ans onions and some fresh spinach. topped with some mozz cheese. Great crust, great base. Ya gotta love it!

My family makes this dough at least once a month.  We love the slight sweetness and addition of herbs.  I have added a bit of grated parmesan cheese during the bread cycle for extra flavor.  I would highly recommend this recipe for breadsticks too!

This crust was really good and easy.  I used it with an alfrado recipe on this site and it was great.  I'm sure it would make great bread sticks as well.

Absolutely awesome.  I have used this dough to make pizza, calzones, and cheese sticks!  It is slightly sweet and I can't get enough!  I have already made it 6 times!

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  The dough seemed a little too sticky while it was in the bread machine but i let it do its thing.  It was perfect after it was rolled in flour a few times.  After I rolled the dough out i let it rise on the pizza pan for a little while to make it extra fluffy.  I had to precook it a bit because my first pizza was complete mush on the bottom.  I thought the taste and texture was perfect.  My husband complained that it wasn't a very sturdy crust, which it wasn't.

This pizza crust was great! Even my picky kids liked it. :-)  Definately reduce the temperature to 450 or 425 otherwise the inside is dough and the outside is already really brown.

Definately a great thick pizza crust.  I also added some rosemary.  It did have a chewy center but I think I should've pre-cooked the crust more before adding the sauce.

Read everyone else's review and didn't see anyone with a similar problem so it must have been me.  Either I failed to add enough flour or I let the dough sit too long in my bread machine.  It had fallen and looked like "webbing."  It was extremely gooey and sticky.  I had to add a lot more flour to get it to the right consistency.  Having said all that, it turned out surprisingly good.  I brushed a small amt. of olive oil on my pizza stone and sprinkled it with some corn meal.  The dough was very easy to spread.  I then brushed some olive oil on top and baked the crust first for about 8 mins.  I added my toppings and baked for an additional 8 mins.  Although the pizza wasn't quite as soft as I was hoping (a little too dense from so much flour), it was still quite good.  Very easy to make in the bread machine.  I think next time I will cut the sugar back to 2 Tbsp.

A very good crust, if a bit sweet.  Next time, I'll cut the sugar in half.  I baked this on a pizza stone, and it baked up just the way my family likes their pizza:  crisp and crusty on the outside and soft and chewy inside.

Awesome recipe. I divide it into three personal pizza's so my wife and two-year old can have their favorite. I prepare them on a pizza peel and slide them onto a preheated stone. *****

This is a great pizza crust.  It has lot of flavor and a great aroma while it's baking.  Also, it's so easy to just throw everything into the bread maker!  Thank you, Richard!

Very easy to make, delicious dough. The kids (3,5,6,) loved it. Better than take out.
