These are excellent!  I made patty size and served on a biscuit with ranch & bleu cheese for a lunch.  Very good.

pretty good!  i didn't use the whole cup of hot sauce, and we just had sharp and medium cheddar.  only thing i didn't like about them was the cheese inside didn't really melt.  maybe it was the cheese i used?  we had these for our super bowl meal...went over well!

Made this for a party we went to. Everyone loved it. Very unique and original. Had ranch and bleu cheese dressing to dip them in. Next time I make them I'm going to try adding cream cheese to the mix.

Mixed these up and let them sit overnight. We made half the recipe, and I did add a couple heaping tablespoons of cream cheese to the mix. We used panko crumbs for an extra crunch. And I used a fry pan with oil, not a deep fryer. They were awesome! I thought the sharp cheddar made them a bit 'saltier' but still awesome. We might try making patties and doing a sandwich sometime. This one is perfect if you love the hot buffalo flavor like we do.

The balls didn't form together at all until I heated up the cheese and chicken mixture and then they worked great. i switched the ranch mix for onion soup mix bc my bf doesn't like ranch then deep fried them. Be careful not to fry them too long because it doesn't take long for them to get burned. But my bf still ate them and wanted me to make them again so I will definitely start making these more often-just less burnt!

Tasty,  I used panko bread crumbs.  The maintained their crispness even a room temp.  They didn't last long.  I served them with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. WINNER

These were a little salty for most of us but they were so good we ate them anyway.  Found out the buffalo sauce and the ranch mix (I used Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch) contained tons of sodium so I think I will decrease one of them...probably the Ranch Mix.  I used Panko bread crumbs as the balls would be traveling and I wanted them to stay crispy.  I also used cream cheese as others suggested but I feel this was a waste of time and money.  Can't wait to make these again with the changes.

I didnâ€™t care for the canned chicken. I think if you use real chicken it would be great!

Followed recipe as written and my son loved them!!  I used panko bread crumbs which gave a great crispy texture to the creamy filing.  I did leave them in the fridge overnight to firm up.

Another hit and our annual fantasy football party! I used the canned chicken breast and followed the recipe. I did allow for additional time in the fridge prior to breading and then again before frying as I had tripled the recipe and the breading process took the longest. I used Panko crumbs for added crunch, It's best to also use a small ice cream scooper for equal sized balls.

I made these for two different parties and they were a huge hit! I didn't use as much hot sauce as recommended and added a little cream cheese. I served them with Uncle Dan's Ranch and a side of hot sauce. I made a double batch and they were all gone! Great recipe!

OMG!  Thank You Thank You Thank You AllRecipes.com for this AWESOME IDEA.  I rated it four out of five stars because I modified the recipe a bit & think my recipe IS/WAS THE BEST.  
Instead of canned chicken breast, I used a grocery store Rotisserie's chicken & removed all the bones & FAT.  Instead of using Frank's Hot Sauce I used Crystal's Buffalo Sauce.  I also added a pinch of Garlic Powder!   Yummy yummy.

It was good. I used 20oz of shredded grilled chicken. It needs about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of melted butter for fat and flavor.

These were interesting. I liked them but felt they were missing something.
