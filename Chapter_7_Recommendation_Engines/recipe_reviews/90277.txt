I'd like to address a few concerns from the reviews: This was a recipe passed to me from my mother-in-law and is one of those that doesn't list measured amounts, being made "from memory." The dumplings vary from batch to batch.I have remade them several times with measurements and have found that two large potatoes equal approximately 2 cups of 1" cubed peeled potatoes and you will need around 2 cups of white flour. You may want to put in 1/2 cup at a time. Depending on the moisture content of the potatoes and/or the size of the eggs, you made need more than 2 cups. The last time I made, 2 cups was enough. The most recent batch I needed 2 1/2 cups. I always make a few dumplings first in the pan of boiling water. If they start to fall apart within a few minutes of cooking, you need to add more flour. It is not unusual to see some small pieces break from the edges. Take a dumpling out to taste--should be a little chewy in the middle and softer on the outside. To address the "blandness" that has been described, I realized there was no salt in the dough. I have started putting about 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the dough. Also, you will get a lot of salt from the bacon. If you aren't cooking with bacon and onions, plan on gravy or sauerkraut on top, or just add some butter to melt on. I hope this helps anyone willing to try my recipe.

I made these dumplings tonight for dinner with pork cutlets and peas and pearl onions.  The dumplings were by far the star of the meal.  I didn't think they were that hard to make, especially with a food processor.  Once the potato and egg were mixed together it was really soupy.  I was afraid I would need another potato, but I just kept adding flour until it was like bread dough and they came out great.   I used four good sized pieces of bacon and buzzed those in the food processor to cut them into small pieces.  It made the food processor very greasy, but it was a lot faster than cutting with scissors and the pieces were nice and small.  It's definitely not low fat or low cal, but they taste great and are easy to make.  I think you could come up with a good soup based off of these dumplings.  Maybe a corn chowder with bacon dumplings, yum... I'll have to experiment.

I made these for dinner with a roast beef and veggie.  The dumplings were very bland - I will try again, but will add seasoning to the 'dough'.  I can see why one reviewer said she added too much flour - it would be helpful if the ingredients listed an approx amount of flour to use.  I started with a 1/4 cup and kept adding 1/4 cups until I had put  1 1/4 cups of flour in. I also had far too much onion - I used a Vidalia and it ssems that 1/2 a large Vidalia is a lot more than 1/2 of a yellow onion. My husband asked me if I could add something to the recipe - he too thought they were bland.

The dumplings were falling apart in the water until I added some baking powder to the batter (about 1 Tbs).  They grow very much in size then, so if you add baking powder, make them very small.

I found this recipe while trying to find a pierogi recipe.  It was very good.  I didn't chop the bacon but fried it in the skillet and crumbled it when done, no messy clean-up of the food processor. 

Since these are a relative of pierogis, you would probably do well by just sauteeing the onions and dumplings in butter.

Boil the dumplings in a large kettle, not a pot.  They need room to swim around in the boiling water.

WOW! I have made potato dumplings from a packaged mix for years. Every recipe I've tried just never seemed to measure up. No more premixed potato dumplings for us! These were perfect!

We grew up on these.  My Mom never used a recipe and I still make them--always in large batches with some to freeze!  I squeeze out all of the extra liquid from the onion and potatoes before adding the egg or flour.  You want them as tender as they can be so use the least amount of flour you can.  It is okay if bits fall off of them while cooking! I scoop teaspoon-sized amounts off of the side of a plate into boiling water.  If you get the spoon very hot in the boiling water first the dough won't stick as badly.  When they rise to the top, time them 5 minutes and take out and drain.  Besides frying them with the bacon and onion, Mom served them with cottage cheese on top!  Yum!!

I tried this recipe after reading the second review posted by the author. I can understand her tips. Back in the days, when moms and grand-moms cooked, they almost never measured. They judged by consistency. Having a recipe passed down to you is sometimes difficult to duplicate because its being passed from someone whose done it for years, and doesn't measure at all. That being said, I followed PAMINMI's advice, and I loved these. I added about 1tsp of salt and 1tsp garlic powder to the dough, and a bit of heavy cream into the onions and bacon for a kind of creamy sauce. I served them with pork chops baked in the oven and my husband went back for seconds. Thanks for the second post Paminmi, it definitely helped =)

This method of making dumplings is so quick and easy! The dumplings themselves deserve 5 stars because of their versatility. I just didn't care too much for the bacon onion part because I a lot of the fat stayed on the bacon and the bacon did not get the crispy texture I prefer. It was easily fixed however by cooking the bacon in strips first; then removing from fat to cool; then frying onion in fat; after add the dumplings and crumble the bacon on top. This was delicious! Will definately make again.

I just realized I messed this up!  This was was NOT a success for me.  Perhaps I added too much flour.   The dumplings lacked flavor an turned out kind of chewy and lacking flavor.

These were great. I chopped the bacon and onion in the food processor too.
I fried cabbage with the bacon and onion and then added the dumplings.
Just to experiment, I added shredded cheddar and wrapped little bits of the whole mixture in won ton wrappers and fried them. VERY time consuming but delicious.

I have made these dumpling many times.  My grandmother used to make them all the time.  She taught me to use cheese cloth to squeeze out the water after she grated the potatoes so not as much flour is needed.  Also, she used to make the potato, egg, flour mixure into a pasty consistency and put the cooked onions and bacon inside of the dumpling.  Then boil them and fry them a little in the bacon grease.  Yummy!

This recipe is outstanding! was so easy to prepare and so delicious! Since I was in a little hurry I kinds cheated and used thawed frozen hasbrowns instead and the constincency was great. cooked the bacon and onions just till tender and warmed in oven right before main course was done It was the hit of the meal, FYI pour the bacon grease over if you put in oven. Not low-cal Thank-you!

These are SO yummy and flavorful. Really not too difficult, just a little time consuming as mentioned. They're not exactly for someone on a low fat or "healthy" diet, but they're an excellent addition to any type of warm, home cooked meal.

It was OK.  I used up my last 2 potato because I wanted more for sides instead of mashed so decided to try this.  I wish I  could've just did mash instead.  I followed recipe exactly even adding some salt to it and it was still blah.  It was just too rubbery for me and none of my kids ate it.  I wont be trying this again.

First of, I forgot to add the EGGS! LOL.  Surprisingly, it still came out good.  I will try it with the eggs next time.

Anywho,  The recipe was really good. My boyfriend loved it!   

I did a few things differently.  I blended the potatoes with water and added about two teaspoons of Accent Seasoning since i heard people complaining about the blandness. WORKED.

I added leeks to the salted boiling water of domplings. 


For the bacon sauce I also added leeks along with some butter, onions,  and some doses of heavy whipping cream to make use of the flavor extracted from bacon.  I didn't want the flavor to dry in the pot.  I added a little accent seasoning aswell.

I rolled the domplings around in the sauce and it came out with a wonderful flavor..not bland at all.  Also a beautiful bacon browned covering.. 

Great recipe!  My BF wants it for the rest of his life!  LOL

Thx again

my only change was to add salt to the dough, otherwise they would have been bland. they were easy to make (not more time consuming than any other typical dinner), although there's a lot of cleanup. but they were a huge hit with my boyfriend. I'll probably make these again.

Most excellent Paminmi...Just like my Grandmother use to make.  She would layer the dumplings with cottage cheese topped with plenty of fresh ground pepper and then the bacon & onion.  I did add salt to the dough and browned the dumplings with the bacon & onion this time and WOW...Perfection..Thank you

these were really tastey, but really hard to get the dough to the right consistency.  like other reviews, i added salt.  probably about a tablespoon and it could have used more.  i used two really large potatoes (probably a lb a piece).  honestly, i probably won't be making this again bc it was so time consuming.

Way too much work!  They kind of disintgrated when I cooked them with the bacon and onion.  I didn't cook the whole recipe, with the left overs, I thinned it a bit with milk and made potato pancakes.

These dumplings came out okay.  A "little time consuming" is a major understatement.  The first batch just kept burning down and losing the browned outside, the second batch at a lower heat came out nice looking, but took a long time.  Overall, the flavor was very, very bland.  If I were to make these again, I would definitely add some herbs/seasonings to the potato 'dough' before cooking, but I doubt I'll make the effort.

these were absolutely fantastic! after boiling these i just melted a tiny bit of butter on them for serving because our main dish was pretty heavy so i decided to skip the bacon and onion. served these w/ oven roasted brussel sprouts and pork medallions with dijon sauce from this site. cant wait to try them w/ the bacon and onion next time.i did try one w/ some sour cream and it was good but i liked it better w/ the dijon sauce from the pork tenderloin i made. thanks for the post!

These were yummy but best made with a meat dish with gravy or sauce. I made them plain and they were good but would have been better as a side dish.

This recipe is incredibly similar to the recipe my family on my mother's side has been making for decades on New Years Day.  I never really paid attention to what mom was putting in but I think there was baking soda or baking powder along with the flour.  I don't remember eggs.   Every family adds just a little something different I guess.

I made these along with cream chicken, just put the dumplings into the sauce of the chicken, cook twenty minutes, then enjoy the best chicken and  dumplings ever. I used a creamed chicken recipe from here as well, with chicken broth, and caned mushroom soup. Brown the chicken pieces cut into smaller pieces, or you can use chicken pieces, fryed up in butter/ veg oil first. I'm sure your family will make this dish one of their favorites.

I have been making these since I was little boy with my Polish Grandma. A couple of important notes to the directions. 
1. If you use a food processor on the raw potatoes you must make sure they are as fine as possible. Should feel like wet play dough.
2. Most importantly, DRAIN EXCESS WATER FROM THE POTATO PUREE before adding flour and salt.
3. The amount of flour always varies since no two  potatoes are the same , the more moist the potato puree the more flour you need. You want just enough flour to make them stay together in the boiling water. Too much flour and they will be too dense and hard. Not enough flour and they will dissolve in the boiling pot. 
4. Use a bigger pot than you think you need to give the dumplings room to roll around and leave plenty of room for the dumplings as they displace a lot of water.
5. Stir lightly occasionally to keep them from clumping together or sticking to the bottom.
6. Yes the batter needs salt. Making a tablespoon out of my palm, I use 2 of those and a little pepper.
7. Finally I start frying my onion a little earlier than the bacon to help darken the onion without over cooking the bacon. 

Enjoy, I hope this helped.

Awesome recipe! We strained the shredded potatoes in cheesecloth and were so surprised how much liquid came out! We used less than 1/2 cup flour!
Loved this recipe!

Thanks for this recipe!   Exactly like my German grandma's.    Had no trouble with stuff falling apart in boil.    Added half tsp Of salt as author suggested.   Potatoes differ in moisture so being vague in reference to flour additions is proper.   Thick dough is a good description.  Spoon dipped in boiling water to keep dough from sticking is good advice.   Cooked for my family of four as side with steak.   All gone!  These would be great in classic chicken and dumplings.  I can see fun additions to dough in future to try:  grated cheese,  chives,  bacon bits.

These were good, but the recipe is really more of a blank slate for the cooks to add their own spices and flavoring.  I feel foolish for even pointing this out, but at first I was confused as to whether the potatoes should be cooked or raw.  I do not have a food processor, so I ended up grating the potato and onion and squeezing out the extra liquid.   I think my dumplings used less flour this way and had a better texture.

Would've been five stars ... The dumplings tastes awesome. However, instead of frying the dumplings as described then only fry enough to cover the frying pan until the dumplings turn brown and onions are transparent.
