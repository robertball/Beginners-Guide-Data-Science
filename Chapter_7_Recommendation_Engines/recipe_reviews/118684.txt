I loved this recipe! I didn't have any apple juice, so I added orange juice, instead. It was too windy to grill outside, so I used my indoor grill. The chops were thick, so it took a while, but it was worth the wait. I can't wait until next time when I will grill them outside.

Made it. Great! Works on boneless chops too, and doesn't need to sit long if you tenderize the meat. Tastes great on chicken too.

I made these with beer instead of apple juice. How many people have apple juice on hand if they don't have kids? It turned out good regardless.

I marinated these and brought them to a tailgating event.  After coming off of the grill, they were so moist and tender!  So much so, that some people made pork chop sandwiches out of them.  I used apple sauce instead of apple juice which worked fine.  Very easy recipe.

Wonderful! Very easy and very good. We used boneless pork chops and broiled in the oven 7 minutes on each side. Came out perfectly.

My husband and I loved this!  I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar and molasses.  Thanks for the recipe - I'm going to use it again tomorrow night for a BBQ!

Wow!  We just finished this dish for dinner.  It passed the kid test with 2 out of 3 liking it.  I loved the little crust that formed during the grilling process.  I did like the other lady and added beer to the recipe instead of juice and it was still awesome.  I did, however, take the excess marinade, did a quick reduction, and served it on the side.

Amazingly good! If I could rate more than 5 stars I would. I made this with the ingredients and amounts listed with the exception of using very thin boneless pork loin cutlets. And since it was raining outside, I broiled them in the oven for 3-4 minutes on each side. Husband and I both loved them!

My fiance called this tasty marinade a "lifer," which is good news for me because it was incredibly easy. Now he wants me to marinade everything I cook in it.

This is about as easy as it gets!!  It takes literally no time to put this together and the results are excellent!!  My only deviation from the recipe was to use orange juice.  I was curious about the Dijon mustard in this and wondered if it would be overpowering.  It wasnâ€™t at all.  The flavors all melded beautifully.  I reserved a little of the marinade for Hubs to baste on toward the end of grilling.  The marinade is so good, next time I will make a little extra to drizzle on when plating.  Excellent, fast and delicious!

Loved this.  I didnt have apple juice so I used some cranberry juice.  Later I thought I could have used applesauce but oh well, it was still delish.  I fixed it on the stove top.

Excellent marinade for pork chops, and it's easy to prepare. My only change was to substitute red wine for the apple juice.

This was really tangy & sweet, I didn't have apple juice so I used apple sauce instead - turned out great & the sauce left beautiful grill marks.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The flavor is a lot like honey mustard, only better. I look forward to trying it on chicken as well.

These were DELICIOUS!  The marinade is wonderful.  Because of a thawing error on my part, the chops were in the marinade just shy of 8 hours, but they were still flavorful and delicious!  Thank you for this wonderful pork chop recipe!

Easy and flavorful. Didn't have apple juice so used orange. Could use beer or water as most of the flavor comes from other ingredients. Recipe says use 2/3 cup and save rest to baste, but unless you double it there won't be any extra. As written it is enough for 4-5 nice size chops. If chops are thick, piercing with fork may help infuse flavor. I only marinated for 3 hr but flavor was still great.

I thought there was too much of a mustard taste, so I increased the brown sugar slightly.  I also put in most of a very small apple juice box (one of the toddler sized-ones) instead of 3 tbsp.

Great marinade, even for 30 minutes it added good flavor! I boiled the marinade after and dipped the chops in it, it wasn't necessary because our thick chops were juicy but the sauce was very good! Oh and I didnt have apple juice so I used OJ, yummy! :)

As another reviewer mentioned, this isn't a knock-out recipe.  It is a great, quick "everyday" dinner.  We cooked our boneless pork chops in a skillet with a splash of oil and some extra marinade -- we didn't have time to grill.  Came out subtly flavored and juicy.

Awesome. I don't usually like pork chops but my husband loves them so I decided to try this. I also used apple sauce instead of juice, worked great.  Something I will make again and again.

Did not change the recipe at all except I used a brown mustard rather than a Dijon.  Chops were very tender and had a really fabulous flavor without any one ingredient being too heavy.  Will definitely put in the permanent recipe box.

We made these last night and they turned out really good!  Nice flavor, not too mustard-y like I thought they might be.  We used pork shoulder steaks since they were on sale.

This is really quick and easy to make, and tastes terrific!  I only had time to marinate for about 45 minutes, and it still turned out great.  I will make this again and again.  5 Stars Plus!   Thank you for submitting this tasty recipe.

I absolutely looooooved this recipe.  But the second time I used chicken.  And instead of apple juice, I used orange juice.  Instead of brown sugar, I used vanilla.  Instead of Worcestershire sauce, I used ketchup.  Instead of Dijon mustard, I used horse radish.  And I used a grill instead of the oven.  This was the best recipe ever!

Great marinade...I only had 2 hours to marinate my chops, but they were sooo good. Everyone really liked them. The apple juice is definitely the taste-maker here. Easy AND delicious! Would share this one and will make again in near future. Thanks.

These were EXCELLENT! I didn't have any worcestershirs, so I added 3 TBS of bbq sauce. 

These were the BEST pork chops and I don't really like pork that much! My sister even asked for the recipe..and she never does that because she thinks she's the cooking queen ;) 

Will make again and again, and again! 

Thanks Babette!

great recipe, didn't have apple juice but it is Fall season so i just took a McIntosh apple, cut up and ground some pieces to add to the sauce. thickened it up nicely like apple sauce. Oh I didn't try it but... a dash of cinnamon might be nice.

Just grilled up some bone in pork chops tonight, and the marinade was perfect.  It was tender and not strong at all.  Didn't even taste like mustard to me.

Yummy!! My kids ate them up!  I used the reserved marinade as a sauce instead!  I didn't have apple juice on hand, but I did have some honey bourbon that was not being drunk, that was delicious!  Marinated it overnite. I did add apple juice to the reserved marinade the next day and it made a wonderful rich sauce.

I loved this, I tried it but didn't cook it on a grill as it was nt weather appropriate. I broiled them for 7 mins per side on my broiler pan in my oven, they were amazing!! I am not a big fan of pork chops as they are usually dry and boring, made like this.. I could have them a couple of times a week... simply scrumptious! And easy to make :)
Thank you

This was really good. My pork wasn't as tender as I would have liked even after marinading overnight, but the flavor was good. I boiled down the leftover marinade and served as a sauce.

I used equal amts of Dijon mustard and Honey Mustard (French's has their own brand now) Also added some salt and pepper, juice of small can of mandarin oranges. Also had some apple cider from when I had been sick and added a Tablespoon on this on top of each pork chop as they were marinating. I omitted the Worchestershire sauce and brown sugar as hubby is diabetic and felt this wouldnt affect flavor if left out..Used pork loin steaks, tenderized them then marinated for abt 20 minutes. Served mandarin oranges alongside.. These were some of the best chops i've ever grilled..

These were wonderful.  I too used apple sauce instead and I marinaded them for just over 30 hours.  they were "almost" too sweet so I might try them with 1/2 the sugar next time but I really did love them as is.  Thank you!

Delicious flavor, really added something special to bland pork chops.  We only marinated it for 6 hours but it was still great.  We served it with Fried Cabbage I from this site, it was a great combination.

I made these last night.  They were planned for Sunday, but we had something come up, so they marinaded way longer then 8 hours.  They still tasted great.  My husband loved them.  This is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband made these for the first time a few weeks ago.  Since then, we have had it about 3 times.  We have grilled and broiled the chops, and we also used this recipe to marinate a small pork loin roast.  This turned out great too.  For the roast we basted it a few times during cooking.  I have found that the longer you let this marinate the better.  This has become a keeper for us.  I can't wait to serve it to family and friends next time we have a cookout.

I made this Sunday for dinner with the in laws, and it was great.  I used Center cut chops and marinated them for approx 6 hours, the only thing I did different was I didn't have apple juice, I used a little OJ, and it turned out great!  I did double the sauce for extra juice, but it turned out great, moist and tender.  No leftovers!!  Will keep for future!

We had these chops marinating when we had to leave unexspectantly and didn't return until late.The next afternoon I pulled them out and grilled them. All I have to say is Thank you, Mom! Our whole family loved them. Nice and tender and I think marinating that long wasn't a bad thing. Lots of flavor.Will make again. I shared these with my sisters. Thanks 
Babette.

This is very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, grilled over hardwood charcoal and added some hickory chips.  The chops received rave reviews from all six of the people who were here.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Five stars for incredibly easy to whip up. We don't ever have apple juice, but orange juice worked just fine. Used boneless sirloin chops and they were very tender and tasty with a nice flavorful crust on the outside.

Even the kids loved this, and I didn't even marinate it, just put it on the chops and baked, turned out wonderful. Nice and tangy with a hint of sweet. Will definitely do again, will marinate to see difference next time.

I enjoyed this a lot!  It was super simple to make and very tasty, especially since it was basted with the marinade.  I only marinated for about 4 hrs but they were thin, boneless chops and this seemed fine.  I'd like to try this with chicken too!  thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  Made these paired with back apples and it was a huge hit.  The key is to use good dijon.

Outstanding, easy meal. Even the picky eater kids devoured these chops. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce at home, so I substituted Trader Joe's steak sauce. Worked out great, I'll definitely make this again.

I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or if the pork chops would just taste mostly like mustard. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious they turned out, and that is with boyfriend kind of burning them on the grill. The taste of the unburned parts was amazing. I will try this again and hope they don't burn.

Can I say YUMMMMM FLIPPIN OOOO?!! These were OUTSTANDING! I loved them! I marinated these for 1/2 the day then my awesome grilling hubby grilled these to perfection...I LOVED them! I am so gonna try this on chicken as well. I will use this marinate over and over..the only thing I did different was the whole apple juice thing...I do have kids, but fon't always have apple juice, I had apple grape so I said why not and loved it! :-) I will make sure to have this on hand for this recipe! They are perfectly the right amount of sweet..you rock, thanks for posting this one!

This was so yummy. I forgot to marinate the chops and it was still good. I just used this to baste the meat while it was on my George Foreman grill. the rest of the chops were marinated and it was even better. Easy and yummy!

Great marinade.  I only marinated for about 1 hour, however it was still flavorful.  I substituted orange juice for the apple juice and used the Foreman grill.

I made this by the book, adding only 1/3 tsp black pepper and 1/2 garlic powder, and can I say, I haven't ENJOYED my own cooking this much in ages! I mean I always like what I make and how it tastes, but with a new baby I haven't found time to marinate anything in ages. It marinated for 6 hours and then I cooked the chops in the George Foreman grill. My husband and I shared a beer and just drooled over these great chops! This one's going into the rotation!

We are not big prok eaters but was seriously tired of chicken so I tried this recipe out. SO glad I did. I did not even allow to marinate full amt of time and they still turned out great. Next time I will allow the full time for them to marinate as I am sure that will only enhance recipe. A def. keeper!

I've been making this recipe sans apple juice for years and serving with garlic mashed potatoes. Nothing lost without the apple juice, just a bit thicker of a coating on the chop and the sugar caramelizes while grilling!  Simple & easy!

We love this recipe.  It's so easy and so delicious.  The marinade carmelizes and makes the pork chops yummy.  I have made this four or five times and my husband always enjoys it.  Bone-in seems to taste the best.

These were WONDERFUL!!!  Like another reviewer, I used applesauce instead of juice.  Did not marinate but about 3 hours; grilled 1/2" chips 10-12 mins per side.  Perfect!!!  Can't wait to have again!

These were great, definitely a keeper recipe and very easy to make. I used beer instead of apple juice. I broiled them instead of grilling. I also reduced the leftover sauce for a while on the stove and used it as a side dipping sauce. Delicious!

I have used my kid's apple juice box (like Juicy Juice) and have marinated for as little as half an hour.  We've used bone-in chops and boneless chops.  We keep a reserve of marinade for a dipping sauce.  It has become a summer grilling favorite.

These pork chops were delicious.  I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon mustard because I don't like dijon.  The taste was great and the pork chops were very moist. Will definatly cook again.

Very good.  I didn't have dijon so I used honey mustard.  Still great.  Next time, I will double the sauce and use half for dipping.

This is a great recipe for pork chops!  I have made this twice so far, and the first time I tenderized the meat and let it marinate for 4 hours (according to one reviewer).  They were bursting with flavour!  The second time I made these I didn't tenderize the meat and I let it marinate for a day and a half.  The chops were not as tasty as the first time I made them.  I will make this again but with the additional step of tenderizing the meat.  Will also try marinade with boneless chicken breast.

Yum!  My dinner plans were derailed so I ended up marinating these for well over 24 hours before grilling.  They turned out great!

This is the best grilled pork chop recipe I've ever tasted. I've never really been a big fan of pork chops, myself, but this recipe has changed my mind. It's absolutely delicious!

This recipe was wonderful. I needed to find something tasty for the grill. I usually just cook my pork chops indoors but with the warmer weather here I prefer not to. 
The family really liked it.  Only thing I added was garlic salt and onion power (we put that on everything)

"These are the best tasting pork chops I have ever tasted!"  This from my DH at least 3 times during the meal! I served these with grilled fresh pineapple, and potato salad.  I used 3/4 in thick boneless porkchops and tenderized them with a heavy spiked tenderizer (Pampered Chef), and then marinated for 2 1/2 hours. The only thing I added to the marinade was 1/2 teaspoon groung black pepper. I basted the reserved marinade 2 times during grilling over  medium charcoal for about 6 minutes per side. Fabulous!

This was very good! I added a little dab of lemon juice and some pepper. I only had an hour to let the meat marinate, but it still had lots of flavor. Since it's winter I cooked it indoor on my George Foreman grill. I'll be making these chops more often. My picky toddlers even loved them.

This is a great full flavor recipe.  I also didn't have the proper time for marinating and used thick cut pork chops.  Took the advice from another and just basted over & over again until they were done.  Blacken them also tastes awsome.  My 6 yr old even couldn't get enough.

I followed this recipe as is - and the marinade/baste really didn't "stick to" the chops as much as I would have liked. There was just a hint of flavor. I am not sure what could have made it better, though. I tasted the marinade on it's own - and it was very good. Just wish I could have tasted it more on the meat! I would probably not make this again because we found it to be somewhat boring.

OK, I have to be fair...I really don't like pork chops-dry/tuff, also had to substitute the sauce for A1 sauce ( it's all I had on hand).  It was just ok for me.  SORRY.

I am not a big fan of pork chops(too dry). I made this for my husband and I. I loved them. I used boneless pork, didn't change the receipe, marinated 6 hours. Will make again.

I marinated the chops for about 6 hours and made extra sauce for basting on the grill. It was just okay, pretty dry, but it may have been my fault since I had to use spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, it was all I had. I can't think how it would have made a huge difference though using a different mustard. Gave it 3 stars due to my changing the mustard, but won't make this again.

This is a winner... my kids scarf it down! I make it as stated, though I use whatever pork chops I have around (bone-in or boneless, thick or thin). Just remember to adjust the cook time because it is not good overcooked.

A definite home run!  I am a new cook and love finding different recipes to try.  The sauce is excellent!  I over cooked the pork chops  slightly (my bad) but they were still very edible and tasty.  I will try this marinade on chicken next!

Really (like really, really) good and super easy!  Substituted OJ for apple juice. Used a 2 lb boneless, skinless sirloin pork roast that I thick sliced myself.  Marinated 6.5 hours.  Threw chops and sauce in preheated, lightly oiled skillet.  Cooked for 5-7 min each side, I was careful not to over cook so the chops were moist and tender. The sauce thickened as it cooked and was wonderful with chops over brown rice.  For a side dish I sauted 2 lg sliced zucchini, 1 med largely diced onion, and 1 lg sliced red bell pepper (seasoned with parsley, salt, and pepper).  The veggies perfectly complemented the sauce and the whole meal was delish!!!

The only thing I would do different next time is add maybe 1/2-1 cup chicken broth to sauce as it simmers to create a little more sauce and tone down the Dijon flavor that concentrated during simmering.

I was so surprised at how moist (and TASTY!) these were, even though I only marinated for about an hour.  I took other reviewers suggestions and:
1.  Tenderized the chops first
2.  Used orange juice instead of apple because that's what I had
3.  Made extra to use for brushing on while cooking

I doubled this recipe for four chops that were very thick with the bone in. Chops were moist and very tender. I think maybe I should have pierced the meat to obtain more flavor. Nonetheless, it was very good and I would try it again. I forgot to brush the chops with more sauce while they were on the grill, but they still turned out pretty darn good.

So simple and so tasty! I forgot to reserve some of the marinade for basting so I just mixed up some more real fast and used it as a sauce- delicious! We'll definitely be making these again.
