This is excellent fun and refreshing! I also added diced/chopped vidalia onion. This is addicting! Served with scooper tortilla chips. Thanks!

This is more of a salsa. I cut the recipe in half and I'm glad I did it would have been way too much for our crowd of 5. It's good. Thanks.

I loved this dip! I brought it as an appetizer for Christmas dinner and everyone was shocked at how good it was!

I made this for company the other day and it was the only thing that did not get eaten up. I only used half the amount of Italian dressing and it was still just too tangy/sour. Also it seemed the lack something (maybe beans?) and the green chilies were just too much. I was really hoping to like this recipes but just didn't. It was just odd. If you are looking for a good dip I would try something with an olive oil base with added vinegar for a kick. There is a great recipe on this website if you look up "black bean salsa" that has these ingredients in it and it just tastes better but is comparable to this recipe as far as some of the ingredients. I will not be making this particular recipe again.

This is a really good salsa type dip. I ended up having to use salsa in place of the diced tomatoes and chiles and had to use roasted red pepper parmesean dressing instead of plain Italian and it turned out wonderful. I think it would go really well in a pasta salad with grilled chicken also.

VERY GOOD! Definitly making this again. I put in less chilis and less cheese and used Fat Free Italian Dressing and it tasted great! Excellent Recipe and will be making this again! Wish I would have taken a picture...oh well...Next time.

I made this for a work carry-in. Big hit! I made this the night before omitting the black olives due to personal preference. I didn't use a full bottle of dressing only adding enough to wet the vegetables. The following morning I added a bit more dressing. Served it with tortilla scoops and came home with an empty bowl. Next time I'm going to try it with a zesty Italian for a little more zip. This will make a great dip for summer lake parties.

I've made this before (only real difference was fresh tomatoes instead of canned and we called it "boat dip.") and lost the recipe. This one is very similar. As I made it last night I cut back on the amt. of salad dressing I used because it looked to be wet enough already. I'm glad I did. It was perfect without the whole bottle. It was a hit at my party!

I used a zesty italian dressing and pepperjack cheese. Not a bad dip. The kids didn't much care for it and my husband ate it only because he was hungry. I liked it but not enough to make it again.
