Really simple and delicious recipe, has a lovely smooth texture.  It turned out better than I expected.  The eggnog I started with was not very strongly spiced; once the ingredients were mixed, the result tasted more like a lightly spiced french vanilla than an eggnog flavour, so I added some freshly grated nutmeg, some allspice and a bit of cinnamon to the mixture bring out the eggnog flavour.  I left it to stand in the fridge overnight before putting it in the ice cream maker.  Will definitely make again; perhaps I will add some rum soaked raisins to the next round for the grown ups.

This recipe is the best. its perfect. i'll be using it a lot from here on out.  Don't ever use the allrecipes "easy eggnog ice cream" recipe off this site. its really gross and bland. Luckily "No-Cook Eggnog Ice Cream" is absolutely perfect, trust me!

I chose this recipe because I didn't have to cook it. It was easy! It is a good ice cream, but by no means is it amazing. It is very creamy and rich. Instead of the vanilla I used amaretto. I like the flavor amaretto gives ice cream! I might make this again, but may play with the recipe a bit!!

I made half a recipe, so it would fit into my Cuisinart ice cream machine, and ended up with about 3/4 of a quart after processing 25 minutes.  I tasted the mixture before I put it into the machine, and felt that it needed nutmeg, so I added a pretty healthy dose of freshly-ground nutmeg to the custard.  The texture is creamy, smooth, just perfect for scooping.  And the flavor is classic eggnog, very rich, and crazy good (also very decadent!).  Thanks, CHRISTYGOBAR, for this fantastic and EASY recipe; it's going into my Favorites folder.  It's in the freezer right now waiting to top Thanksgiving pumpkin pie this Thursday.

Great.  In case you couldn't tell by the ingredient list: be warned -- it's very very rich.  And you don't lose the egg nog flavor at all.

I'm sure this is a great recipe as is, but I made a couple changes based on reviews I read. If you are like me, and don't like your desserts too sweet or too rich, try using 2 1/2 cups eggnog and 2 cups whole milk instead of heavy cream, and you can keep everything else the same. I didn't have vanilla extract handy, so I scraped out the seeds of two vanilla beans. I also put in some cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and clove... if you do this, be sure to add the spices through a sifter while stirring so that they don't clump up. I don't think this could have came out any better! Will def make again!!!

When I saw this recipe I couldn't wait to try it because you can't get much simpler than a 4-ingredient no cook ice cream, right? I don't care much for sweetened condensed milk because I think it leaves a major aftertaste so I was a little worried that this ice cream would have that issue. It was absolutely scrumptious and oh so easy. If you are looking for a consistency of a shake then it's good to go right out of the ice cream freezer but if you are looking for an ice cream to scoop into dishes I recommend following the tip to freeze in an airtight container for a few hours or overnight.

Great ice-cream recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly and let it freeze for at least 6 hours. My husband and kids ate it up quick. Since we are down to the last bit of eggnog this season I am making more. Yum!

I omitted the sweetened condensed milk and added a half cup of sugar instead.  I think I might take that down a notch though my husband disagrees.  Overall, we and our guests loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

We love this! It is our standard ice-cream recipe. When we don't have eggnog, we use 2 cups of whole milk and a packet of instant pudding in place of the eggnog (just measure 2 cups of milk, add the pudding mix and whisk to blend, then add the 2 cups of cream). We do sometimes skip the vanilla depending on the flavor we've chosen. Right now we have strawberry in the maker and didn't use the vanilla. This also freezes perfectly - you cannot tell it was made without a cooked custard! Just like store-bought but so much better!

This is very simple and quick to make, but I think it's extremely sweet. That's to be expected with sweetened condensed milk, I suppose.

This taste like a really rich vanilla ice cream with a hint of  a nutty flavor.

Made in my Cuisinart Ice Cream maker. Used rich full fat egg nog and rich cream (not light). Added couple shakes of nutmeg. The consistency and mouth feel is very nice. Might be due to the condensed milk. Usually when we make ice cream (non-cook) with heavy cream there is a weird film. Not with this recipe!

It's pretty good as is but WHEN I make it again, I'll add more nutmeg and increase the vanilla perhaps even a bit of rum extract. It's a little plain but still tasty. I may make either a brown sugar sauce or spiced cider sauce to pour over.  Caramel, choc. etc. will beef up the flavor too.

This ice cream is awesome  done according to the recipe. But I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 oz. of orange-spice-maple liqueur {product of Shelter Point distillery Campbell River B.C.} in addition to all other ingredients. Even more AWESOME now!!

Absolutely delicious!  Very easy to make, 4 ingredients. I put mine in my ice cream machine. It seemed sweet at first, but after being in the freezer for a while it is perfect. It's creamy and smooth. I used southern comfort eggnog, non alcohol.  I will make for the holidays!

This recipe is very tasty.  The texture is softer than soft serve, so I am freezing it overnight.  I do not care for vanilla eggnog, no I did not add vanilla.  I was afraid it would take away from the eggnog taste.   Instead I added a small amount of nutmeg.  It has the perfect flavor.  My daughter was savoring the spoonful that I gave her.

This recipe is super easy and delicious! I made this  as a Christmas gift for a friend's mom who lamented that she could not find egg nog ice cream anywhere this year. I skipped the vanilla, but grated some nutmeg into it. The equal parts cream did not dilute the egg nog flavor.

so amazingly good. I like my ice cream from my gelato/ice cream maker with a bit of milk substituted for some of the heavy whipping cream. I used about 3/4 C milk and 1-1/4 C cream. Everything else was exactly per the recipe. Thanks for this delicious treat! Our new Christmas favorite for 3 out of 4 of us including a 6 year old boy.

I was afraid it would be too sweet, given the sweetness if condensed milk.  Instead it was perfect.  It was simple, fast and tastes like I spent several hours at the stove preparing a custard base.  I'm thinking of adding rum-soaked raisins or fruit cake mix to it next time.  Oh yes, there WILL be a next time!

This is a great no cook ice cream and best of all if you use a REALLY good egg nog (like Rutters).  My family loves this.  Maybe next time I will try to add egg nog extract or nutmeg for more flavor.  I wanted to try it the first time just like the recipe suggested.

Wow!  This was delicious and so easy!  I felt no need to tinker the recipe and used Darigold's Egg Nog.   I followed the directions and sprinkled a little bit of nutmeg on top when I served it up.  This is going to become a holiday favorite.

I love egg nog and this recipe is so super easy I had to give it a try.  Very rich and creamy!  I think that next time I might try replacing some of the heavy cream with regular milk.  But will definately be making this again, soon.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe that the kids could help with, is very easy and tastes great!

I made this recipe as written, but added 1/4 tsp nutmeg & 2 tsps rum extract. It had a rich eggnog flavor and creamy texture. Definitely one of the best ice cream recipes I have tried. One thing to note, is that it definitely needs to firm up in the freezer for a little bit, because it comes out almost too soft to eat.
