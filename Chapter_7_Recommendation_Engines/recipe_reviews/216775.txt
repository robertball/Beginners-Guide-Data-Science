I think roasting the jalapeno takes the heat out of it, ends up tasting more like canned fire roasted green chilis.  I'm not sure the effort to roast, peel, and chop one jalapeno is worth the effort...but just my opinion.  If I make this again, I think I'll just seed, chop, and add the jalapeno raw, as I didn't taste any "hot."  The fresh pineapple definitely can be tasted and adds great flavor.  This also would make this a snap to get into the oven.  Very crumbly and sweet cornbread, but very tasty.  Served with some homemade jalapeno jelly I had in the fridge.

Okay, I completely changed this recipe.  But it gave me the IDEA for what I did, and that turned out really well, so it gets a good rating for that.  I made a huge batch of this site's "Cornbread Muffins I" by Lisa K and added pineapple chunks (from a can, not pineapple season) and diced seeded jalapeno.  Corn chunks in the batter, with larger pineapple chunks, with slightly hot jalapeno bits made for some very tasty cornbread rolls.

I admit to taking the lazy baker's route on this recipe...diced the jalapeno (no roasting) & used canned crushed pineapple. (I did add a bit of sour cream, just 'cause that's how Mom always made hers.), Boy, this was really good! Moist & flavorful.  Thank you for the great idea!

I used a big spoon of jarred jalape√±os and instead of pineapples I added some canned corn and shredded cheese. Easy recipe and can be switched up! Fun!

This was very tasty. I used crushed pineapple and will add more peppers next time and there will be a next time! :-)

The flavor is yum. Next time, I'd add way more peppers. Mine are from the garden and a little mild. Also, it's really moist, a little too much for my taste. I might try it next time using a slow cooker.

Used crushed pineapples because that is all I had. Did not roast the peppers, just diced them small.  Excellent bread.

This was de-lish! I agree with the other reviewer, you don't need to roast the jalepeno, just dice and toss into the mix!
