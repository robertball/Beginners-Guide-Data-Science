This was divine and I ate way too much. Yum! I used 16 oz of Guiness and 20 oz of fresh apple cider, and had no Granny Smith, just used the little red apples that I had (didn't need to cook them as long as they were a softer variety). Waiting for the onion to brown was almost torture...can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was delicious. I had never cooked with hard cider before so this was an adventure. I selected one that had maple undertones.. the pork tasted really good. I think next time I'll slice up more apples as I really liked those with the pork. I added some of the cider liquid to the pork when I served it as well

This was absolutely delicious. I made it with the Angry Orchard cinnamon seasonal and served on oven toasted onion buns. Will make again!!!

Made this for Recipe Group. I seem to be the odd man out here. Family did not like the apple and onion mixture. I thought the meat was bland, definitely needed some salt and pepper in there. The whole sandwich eaten together tasted mostly of the apples to me. Thanks anyway!

Recipe Group Selection:  20, September 2014 ~ This was a delicious sandwich!  I made half recipe using a one pound pork tenderloin and wish I would have used a two pound tenderloin.  I used Johnny AppleseedÂ® Hard Apple Cider (5.5% alc/vol) in this dish.  When I walked thru the door after work, I didn't like the smell and was totally worried about our dinner.  I shredded the meat and put it back in the slow cooker for another 2 hours as I had plans.  When I got home, I proceeded with the recipe, again worried about the cinnamon in the apple/onion topping.  Well, I had NOTHING to worry about - my husband and I loved this sandwich! I don't care for cooked apples, but they work with this combination.   All the flavors work nicely together. I served this on mini ciabetta rolls along with boiled potatoes and fresh fruit.  coldstar37, I think the group chose a great recipe for Recipe Group, even if I am a week behind in making it.  It is a winner in our house, and one I will be making again.

Recipe Group: Mom and I both really enjoyed this! I tweaked it slightly - using Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and an extra apple. The one "flaw" I found in the recipe, is that it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to caramelize onions [and my stove was turned up higher than medium-low!]. Next time, I would probably only use 2 bottles of the hard cider - or even, maybe, Mots For Tots apple juice. And, throw in another 1/2 an onion and a couple more apples.  I took Saveur's suggestion and served them on pretzel buns (=

Recipe Group pick Sept. 2014: You are so right, coldstar32, this is the perfect fall sandwich!  This would be fun for sliders and tailgating!  I made the recipe as written, just removed the pork and strained the broth, then shredded, and added some broth back in for moisture.  The topping is deeeelish.  I served on pretzle rolls, perfect for this.  Lots of leftovers, so I just added the apple mix right in with the pork for freezing, should be great.  Thanks for sharing with AR.

This was a great recipe and super easy.  Next time I make it, I will use 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup to make it a bit more healthy.

Made this with Newton's Folly Hard Cider (Red Delicious, I think).  Next time I would cut the sugar a little and might try "Pumpkin" spice, rather than straight cinnamon.  I did drain most of the cooking liquid before mixing in the onion/apple mix.  The family loved it. It was great for lunch today!

It was dry. The apple/onion mixture was better than nothing but did not make the meat less dry.  The pork cooking in hard cider smelled nauseating.

My husband and I have made this twice now. We used regular apple cider and hard apple cider. Both were delicious. Regular cider makes the meal more sweet. Hard cider adds a nice yeast taste to the pork, which we felt paired nicely with the sweetness in the apple topping. We served it over toasted ciabatta rolls. We used angry orchard apple crisp cider.

I loved the flavor combination in this sandwich! I did add some salt, pepper and garlic into the slow cooker with the pork. I ran out of butter for the onions and apples so I used some coconut oil. I agree with one review that said the pork was lacking a bit. When I make it again I'll probably add some beef broth and vinegar and only use two bottles of cider. Great comfort food meal!

Served the pork, apples, and onion over homemade cornbread "open face sandwich" style as my boyfriend and I don't like when bread is such a major component of a dinner. I am so happy that I chose cornbread to pair with everything versus serving it on a roll; something about the deliciousness of the cornbread with the sweetness of the apples and pork is absolutely delightful! We will definitely try this again some time even though it does take longer than 20 minutes total to cook the onions and apples to our specific tastes. I didn't want the apples or onions to still have a strong crunch to them and, in my opinion, caramelized onions need to be cooked very low and very slow in order to be done "right". All in all, I would cook this again for us one night... I may even try another different twist the next time!

very tasty.  I used regular cider(2 cups), not hard cider and more apples, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  it was really good.  Oh, and i didn't shred the pork, I just took it out of the crock pot and sliced it.  you would get more of the juice shredding it, but the other way is also very good.

Great recipe! I'm a slow cooker first timer and this made a great first try. Easy to make and tasted awesome. I used strongbow hard cider and served with cole slaw and baked beans, hit the spot.

Thought this was too sweet with the onion/apple mix, and I think the cider gave it a weird flavor.  I might make it again without apples and use beer instead of cider.

This was good but a bit more time intensive than I had bargained for a way more vinegar tasting than I had hoped. All and all a good pork dish just not my favorite.
