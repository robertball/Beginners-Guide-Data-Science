I don't bake much and I've never made candy, but this reciepe was really easy! I actually made a second batch wondering if the first great batch had been a lucky "fluke"..but, Nope! the second batch was just as good and with very little time involved! Be sure to spray your mixing spoon or else the candy kinda clumps on the spoon while stirringThe candy also gets rock hard in the glass mixing bowl once it dries (which is IMMEDIATELY!)..But just soak the  dish and spoons in GOT soapy water and it'll soften and wash right offs. Speaking as an amateur..this reciepe is really EASY!  Good luck!

One tip I would give, and we have done it this way for a while now.  Put butter on the cookie sheet and warm it in the oven until ready.  spread the butter all over the cookie sheet before you pour the brittle.  The peanut brittle will not stick to the pan and clean up is easier.

Excellent!  Try using honey roasted peanuts for a great variety of taste.

This recipe is difficult to say the least... In my opinion at least! I tried it 3 times adjusting times to my 1800 watt microwave and it burned the first 2 times and was too chewy the third time.
I then tried a stovetop version and it seemed easier and came out perfect.

Made this the 1st time last year. Made over 30 batches..took to parties & family gatherings & everyone that tried it said it was the best brittle they'd ever had. Also tried a different variation instead of peanuts used pecans & coconut & it was wonderful too. family liked it so well I'm making more for Christmas eve family dinner this year.

Ive made micro- peanut brittle  for years. This is almost the same recipe.
 Follow another persons idea and butter the trays, keep warm in oven at 200 til you need it.
Also the corn syrup and sugar mix better if that bowl is warm too... Just wash it and have  it warm that way.
I check it after the 3-4 mins, still and add another 1-2  mins so it WILL harden. Dont, if yours is getting too dark. 
Also use good butter, a name brand... Others tend to scorch easier.
 Yumm... Making mine now!!

I didn't care for this recipe.  The sugar didn't melt and it all just globbed up.  I've never had problems with my microwave in the past and things usually cook exactly per recipe directions for time but this was just a mess.  Yuck

I had a problem , mine did not harden after I spread it over sprayed lightly with non stick spray, over parchment paper.  However, I doubled everything in this recipe and simply followed the same instructions for a single recipe on how to micro wave it.  I of course doubled the baking soda and it foamed up like crazy, I immediately spread it over the parchment paper, but after two hours I saw it wasn't hardening, and after 3 hrs, I pulled it apart and remelted it and let it cook another 3 to 4 minutes, it foamed up again so I spread it out, same thing happened it didn't harden.  Such a waste of all those peanuts and other ingredients.  I want to make some peanut brittle but I am afraid I will ruin another batch.   Lucy

This is so good and so easy!  I'm addicted!  I tried to make a different recipe on the stove with a candy thermometer and it was a disaster!!!!  Never again!  I'm doubling this and making it for Christmas gifts for this year. Thank you so much!

Was attempting to make this recipe for the first time using a microwave oven. I made it the other night on the stove top with much success. It was nearing the first five minute mark when my large Pyrex measuring cup exploded. Is Pyrex not considered microwave safe?

Love this recipe. I only stir till just mixed and it's a little like seafoam not super hard. Also add 1/4 teaspoon black and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper for adult brittle and people go nuts for it.

I tried a new thing.... It was easy and it worked!!! Better the second time when I had the ingredients ready and knew what I was doing. I thought I wanted more peanuts, because I hate the scaricity of peanuts in the store-bought kind. Nope, 1 1/2c is just right! Word of advice: Spray or grease your pan and spoon REALLY good!! And I warmed it in the oven at 150 while I made my mix. That helped a lot too!

This was so easy and good that after I made one batch, I had to make another.   The directions are perfect!  I was worried it might stick to the pan so I might have over spayed the cookie sheet which made the brittle coated on the bottom side.  I just took it out and laid it on paper towels to absorb it.  I'll make this every year for Christmas and maybe other times for when we're in the mood.  YUM!

my first ever attempt at peanut brittle -- looks like it turned out ok but this recipe only made 1/2 of a 13x9 baking sheet so if you're going to use this recipe definitely double it -- everything except the peanuts..way too many peanuts for this small of a batch!

Okay I burned 2 batches of brittle before coming across this recipe.  It came out great on the first try! It's the best brittle I've tasted. I used 2 cups of unsalted peanuts.

My husband loves peanut brittle. I tried to make it once. It was yuk. But I saw this recipe and tried it. It looked great and tasted better then the store bought brittle. I'll make this again, I'm sure.

I think the taste is good but the amount of peanuts to add is way off. If you want the taste of the brittle then I would only add about 3/4 cup peanuts. Otherwise its just the peanuts you taste.

I've made this for Xmas twice now..... & it's really good, BUT you need a pyrex or Corel glass pan with a long handle on it & good oven mitts.  Taking it out of the mIcrowave each time and pouring it onto the pan has to be done FAST - without burning yourself because it's hot as heck! Also....have ALL your ingredients measured & ready in ramekins before you start....and parchement paper on the pan works great.  Once you start, you have to move FAST. Be sure to 'grease' your spoon(s) &  spatula  It's also good with chopped pecans or hazelnuts! I make it 2 ways & use it for Xmas gifts along with cookies.

Awesome recipe .... I am a big peanut brittle fan and had my doubts that a  microwave recipe would work but it was the  best I’ve ever had! Served it with some Godiva chocolate pudding adding one piece on the side for dipping and some crushed on top with home made whipped cream.... smash hit!

Super easy I knew from my past experiences my microwave tends to cook more hotter than others so I took 10 seconds off each of the three cook times and it came it ok. So I took cooked it for 5min 40sec the first and 3min20sec the second and 1min20sec the third and it was perfect. I made 5 batches all came out perfect. The last one was a little chewy but i was able to flip it over on the pan and I let it set for a bit longer and it hardened just fine.

This is a great recipe. My microwave gets a little hot so I did 4.5 mins for the sugar and then 3 minutes to finish it and it turned out great. Everyone loves it. Just a tip:  I also use a butter knife to stir and that works much better than a spoon.

Mine didn't turn out well.  I have an 1100 watt microwave and apparently it was made on a microwave with less power.  I did the second cooking for 3 minutes to be safe but is was too long and the brittle came out very dark.

This is a KEEPER!  I made the first batch as a trial run because I figured I'd have to adjust the cook times.  I made it first as written and it was on the verge of having a burnt taste BUT that didn't stop the hubs and I from devouring it.  I  reduced the time from 5 min / 4 min to 4 min / 3 min on subsequent batches and it was perfection!!  Took others suggestion and kept the cookie sheet in the oven on warm while microwaving the mixture.   We like ours really thin so I put a piece of parchment paper over the hot mixture and used my rolling pin to press it thin.  Family LOVES it.  It's like crack!

10/16/2017: I’ve been using this recipe for almost 40 years... with 1 very small difference. My recipe used 1tsp of butter. Everyone always thought it was the bomb! This one, with a whole Tablespoon of butter, is even better, albeit a bit greasy... I wiped some of the grease off with a paper towel as I was putting the pieces into a plastic container to take to a party. People at the party raved about how good it was, and I have to say that it was better than my usual, the only difference being that additional butter!  Thanks for sharing this recipe! 9/28/19 update: Eliminate a bit of greasiness and make cleanup easier by covering the baking sheet with parchment, NO COOKING SPRAY NEEDED!  Just lift the sheet of parchment/peanut brittle off the baking sheet after the candy is cool.  ALSO, to make thicker, crunchier peanut brittle, mix the baking soda and vanilla in quickly and pour the candy immediately, while still foamy. Doubling the recipe works great with double the cooking times.

The peanut brittle turned out great. Nice and crisp and not chewy. Be careful not to cook too long after the peanuts are in or it will scorch. And most importantly do NOT put water in the bowl immediately afterwards or it will break. Let it cool off first.

First time making peanut brittle and so great to do it in the microwave as I don't own a candy thermometer and I'm not really sure if my pots/pans are heavy enough to accomplish this on the stovetop.

It is so crazy easy. I make if for family during the holidays and they all loved it. They think I spent hours carefully monitoring temps but nope, made it in the microwave. Seriously came out awesome first time I made it. The only deficult part of this recipe is keeping it to yourself how stupid easy it was.

It was easy to make.  Good to taste, but my microwave might be a little hotter than what this recipe was based on.  My peanut brittle was very dark.  I almost burned it.  it was ok, but really dark.

Had a bjg craving for some peanut brittle, so I found this recipe and went at it. I know nothing about bakjng cooking , but I just followed the directions and bam! Now am thinking about being a candy maker, this stuff turned out beyond expectation..I dont know why some people have such a problem, its not rocket science.

We have an 1100 watt microwave, so I reduced the cooking time just slightly on the last step.  The brittle turned out great.  My husband loves it.  I also increased the butter in the last step to 2 tbs  in order to make it a little softer.  Love the taste and texture.

I added an extra 1/4 cup of peanuts.  Which made it harder to spread.  Great recipe and will not change it the next time.    I spread the brittle on parchment paper. Will definetely make it again.

This recipe was great... I've made brittle before but I  burned it so I was very cautious this time.... I cut the first 5 minutes down to 4... And followed everything else....

Texture is perfect. Nice crunch and doesn't stick to my teeth.
Substituted pecans for peanuts. To keep pecans from burning: Extend step 3 to 6 minutes. Shorten step 4 to 2 minutes

I have a strong microwave so I adjusted the times to 4 minutes then 3 minutes. I followed everything else to a T and it turned out great. Beautiful caramel color. Perfect!

Didn't like this one, the sugar and corn syrup didn't mix well, not enough salt.

It was very quick, and easy but it didn't taste as amazing as I was hoping for. Too many peanuts for me, and not that sweet.

Easy and consistent results, once you get  the timing down. I burnt the 1 st batch by going the whole 4 minutes after adding the peanuts. In my microvave, it took only 3 minutes 20'seconds. My husband ate most of the first batch, so I had to make another for gifts ! Yummy!
