Scaled up to 28 servings to make 8 cups. I will be using the applesauce in baked goods so I will update my review once I know how compatible it is with other recipes. As is, the applesauce is very tart with just a hint of honey. Personally, I wouldn't eat it this way. *** UPDATE*** Used with Pumpkin Muffins with Streusel Topping off AR. Tasted great and I'm glad I chose an applesauce recipe with no sugar in it.
