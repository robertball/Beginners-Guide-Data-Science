I will be making this salad quite often! I added a 1/4 c more Ranch dressing and I just used a 1/4 cup diced sweet onion rather than green onions. It was a HIT my whole family loved!

i  used much more than the suggested amounts of veggies and also added thinly sliced and quartered yellow squash along with sliced black olives.  instead of hidden valley dry mix, i used lay's ranch dip with a little  milk and oil.  big party, everyone enjoyed it.  will definitely make this again this summer.

Easy recipe. I used what I had on hand - Cauliflower instead of Broccoli, red onions and some Kalamata olives (since my kids loves those in everything) and very little mozzarella cheese cubes. we all felt like it needed more salt. but other than that it was ok. I am gonna try It one more time with the real suggested ingredients.

I really liked this I have been looking for a ranch and bacon recipe and this is it! I forgot the tomatoes and added bacon and only used one zucchini. I didn't put in radishes either.  Very very good yall!
