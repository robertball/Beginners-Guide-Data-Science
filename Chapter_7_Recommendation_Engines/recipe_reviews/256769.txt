This was a hit in our house. I never knew Utah had a fry sauce, but darn glad I found out. I served curly - spicy -sweet potato fries. The onion flavor just pushed this over the top.  Thank you for the recipe.

Until now, I had never heard of  Utah Fry Sauce. Nice alternative to the regular standard - ketchup.  Looking forward to using this one for summer BBQ's and family get-togethers.

We love different sauces to dip our fries in and this one was no exception! Very easy to make and great flavor. This would even be great on a burger...I will definitely be making this one again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
