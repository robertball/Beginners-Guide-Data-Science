Christmas day is also my wives birthday. Since I was already making a large meal I had to come up with something lite for breakfast. When I found this recipe I knew this was what I needed. I did make one change though. I used pasta shells instead of linguine. To my surprise Alice loved it. And she does not like pasta, but she had four more helpings throughout the day. Now I fix it at least twice a month now.

This salad was a great success at my work holiday party. Everyone loved it. I used small pasta shells instead of linguine, and mixed the fruit with the pasta and dressing. It was really tasty!
