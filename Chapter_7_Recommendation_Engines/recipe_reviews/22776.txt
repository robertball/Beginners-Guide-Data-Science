This is a keeper! I will be making my lasagna like this again. I did make some changes,like everyone always does; I used no-cook noodles,put about 1 cup sauce in the bottom of the dish,used jarred tomato sauce because I was time crunched,and browned the meat w/the jar of sauce. I layered it as stated in the recipe,added another jar of sauce on top of the final layer,and added more shredded cheese on top,but covered it,as stated on the box of no cook noodles. I baked it @ 375 degrees for 50 minutes,took the cover off and baked for another 10.Then I let it sit about 10 minutes.Awesome! This is the 1st lasagna that didn't run all over the plate when you try to serve it.My whole family loved it! Thanks for the great recipe! ;)

If using the ingredients exactly as listed, the lasagna has almost no sauce to it.  It is too dry for my taste, but it still tasted good.  Next time I will use more than the 1/2 pound of lean beef that the recipes call for, and add more sauce.

I thought that this recipe was great as a starter.  I used it as a jumping off point.
I kept the cheese the same, although I did add more fresh parmesan, but I used a pound of italian sausage and browned it up added minced garlic to that and cooked some fresh sliced button mushrooms to it as well. (don't forget to drain the grease)
Then instead of using the tomato sauce I got some name brand pasta sauce that had mushrooms in it and another that was like 4 cheese or something... both of the jars that I used were about 26 oz.  This is alot more then the orginal recipe calls for but  it really made it nice and moist.  I did not use the full two jars.  I used about 1 and 1/2.  I heated the sause up before I added it to the layers and mixed in salt, suger, and spices to taste.
I finished it off with fresh mozz on top!  Have fun this turned out great for me!

Wonderful basic recipe to start with. Like many others I added to it - added sausage and beef, herbs, garlic (my family loves garlic)I used jar sauce because I was pressed for time. Can't understand why others are saying it was dry? Perhaps they are using no bake noodles or thick sauce? I would really recommend this recipe as a wonderful starting point to create one's signature lasagna dish.

It's a good starter recipe, but it needed a little work.  If you're going to make the sauce from scratch then you definitely need to let it simmer for a few hours to have good flavor.  Also I used 1 pound of ground turkey (1/2 lb wasn't enough) and almost two 26oz. cans of tomato sauce.  I decided to try with jarred sauce and turned out very good.  There was enough of the cheese, but i added a little more mozzarella and parmesan.

This is a good recipe to play with.  We like even more cheese, we added provolone slices to the top with the parmesan.  Also, we like lots of sauce, so we used prepared sauce especially for lasagna.  I added half a pound of Italian sausage, too.  When I was browning the meats, I added bell peppers, onions, fresh garlic and Italian seasoning.  I like adding fresh ingredients where I can.  It wasn't overpowering with the prepared sauce.  It only added more flavor.  You can do lots with this recipe, just don't be afraid to play with it.

Yummy. I added more Parmesan and used the whole box of no-boil noodles as a timesaver. Instead of plain tomato sauce, I used spaghetti sauce and think the dish overall benefitted from the change. I would make this again.

thought this was very good.. tweaked it a bit to my own likings and used about 36 oz of sauce as opposed to the 19.5 this one called for.. it was the perfect amount and I don't even see how you could have stretched the 19oz for this entire dish..  I also used 1lb of meat and 2 cups or ricotta and mozz and 1/2 cup parm.  I didn't mix the meat and the sauce either.. I put a small amount of sauce on the bottom of the pan.. then noodles, then sauce, then the meat, then the cheese mixture.  Baked at 375 for 50mins covered and 10 uncovered and let it rest about 15 minutes outside the oven.  It turned out excellent and my family loved it! This recipe was a great starting point for me to tweak it to what I wanted. Thanks :)

My husband says he loves everything I make, but rarely does he really rave about something. He loves this lasagna! Before I told him what the name of it was, he said "This tastes like real lasagna, like the stuff you get at restaurants..." My only beef (no pun intended) was that layering everything was kind of awkward - for example it was hard to "spread" the cheese filling over the sauce. I worried about how that would turn out in the end but it was perfectly fine.

Great recipe!  Next time I will change the following though: 1) use half the suggested ricotta cheese, 2) increase the meat to 1 lb (I used italian sausage and it turned out really well), and 3) increase the amount of tomato sauce.  I also added some garlic, parsley, and Mrs Dash to the cheese mix.  Also add 2 cans of mushrooms.

Good starting point for ingredients, but there was not nearly enough ground beef, I used a full pound and still ran short. I would suggest using at least 1 1/2 pound or more if you like it meaty. Also, it came out very dry. It needs twice the sauce and less cooking time. I would suggest 2-15oz cans of sauce and only cooking it for about 30 minutes covered so it doesn't dry out.

I made this recipe exactly as it said. For the pan size it called for there was not enough ingredients. I had to boil more noodles and run to the store to get more cheese and sauce. It was kind of a pain and I was really disappointed. However when it came out it was delicious!!!! Besides having too small amount of ingredients the flavor is wonderful and the lasagna looks great when finished.

This was a good basic recipe. Pre mixing the cheese and adding the 2 eggs caused it to stay put better than the lasagna I usually make.  Because it was less runny it appealed more to my kids.  I kept it simple like the recipe because of my children.  If it were just adults I would layer in squash or zucchini and mushrooms.  I made it in two smaller dishes and instead of cooking one I froze it for later and reduced cooking time by about 5-10 minutes.  I also used low fat ricotta, skim milk mozzarella and whole wheat noodles.

there is not enough sauce in this recipe, i thought... but really it needs a better sauce! i make my pizza and spaghetti with a sauce that i make with red wine and thats all this recipe needs, just substitute 2 1/2 cups red wine + 1 can tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and you should have the right zing for this recipe... remember to simmer the sauce for the wine to be just right!!!!

I found this to be just average, Use large can ofcanned tomatoes & 1 sauce. Tastes better and gives a better  texture.

This is OK for a basic lasagna but I use beef/pork and a white bechemel sauce and cut down on the ricotta

This is a great receipe but I eliminated a couple steps.  I don't beat the eggs (just mix them in with the cheeses and seasonings) and I don't use the use the sugar.  You can also skip the step of cooking the noodles.  Just layer them in and everything cooks at once.  I cover it with foil and bake for 30 minutes then remove the foil and bake for another 10 minutes.

I've been using this recipie for a few years now and it's always so good!  I use a little more tomato sauce, use low-fat ricotta to help knock out a few calories (every little bit helps!), and usually put some veggies in the layers too, such as spinach or zucchini/summer squash.

I made this recipe for dinner last night and really enjoyed it. I used the new Barilla no cook lasagna noodles which made the whole process easy. My husband said it wasn't spicy enough so next time I will use Barilla Marinana sauce. This recipe will be used again.

This is the most requested meal by my friends. I follow the recipe as written. Then I taste test the sauce. I add seasonings until it's flavorful. I also added real garlic instead of the powder. It's the most flavorful lasagna I've ever had.

Ok so this was a very quick and easy recipe. The only thing is I doubled the the meat and even added a little more sauce....It still wasn't enough. I think next time I would do about 2lbs of meat and double the sauce. You have enough of the cheese mixture to make it rhough just not enough of the sauce/meat mixture.

I thought this came out very good. I made the mistake of trying to take a short cut & using the "Oven- Ready" lasagna noodles- don't do this! The noodles in the upper layers didn't even cook all the way! I will definitely try making again (boiling my own noodles first, of course) & adding a tad more sauce & meat.

This was very good. I added about 1/2 tsp. basil and a bay leaf to the sauce, and it turned out very tasty. I was short on time and only simmered the sauce for half an hour. Thank you for the recipe.

Well it was my first time to make lasagna, im 16 and i was making it for my boyfriends 17th birthday. I read all the reviews first soooo i took their advice, i used a pound of ground beef, and the sauce i recommend "chunk garden" by prego. It completly made the difference. I used nearly a whole 3 pound bottle. The rating is for the actual recipe but with the changes, it was great! READ REVIEWS, they make all the difference.

I was so excited to taste it and to my extreme disapointment the cheese wasn't melted and scrumptious as it should be, there were too many spices, and all around tasted like lasagna I would get at a buffet at the sizzler.

Great sauce starter.... I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also put mushrooms and green pepper and onions in the sauce. I let it cook for about 3 hours and then made the lasagna.I think next time I am going to make a crock pot of it and cook it all day to get all the seasonings soak in.

Absolutely the best lasagna i've ever tasted! Far better than what my parents used to make XD I cut the recipe in half because it was only two of us eating it, but in half still made too much but its all gone! I alsomade 4 layers instead of three and only used two cans of spaghetti sauce. Thank You so much! if I could give 10 stars I would!

I enjoyed this recipe even though I don't use the tomato paste. I just use one jar of ragu and one prego. And I add a tbsp of sherry wine in my sauce and at least 4 cloves of garlic with extra layers of cheese it's always a hit.

I used this recipe, change a few things but it came out wonderfully!  First, I used ground turkey (made the dish lighter as a result), I also added additional cheese to the filling, mix of mozarella, monterey and parmesan.  I also used italian seasoning and pepper to give the sauce some seasoning. My family loved it...this will become a dinner staple.

I made this delicious lasagna, but I actually change a few things; instead of only beef, I convined half beef and half pork, grounded twice together, it gives an extra flavor. I love it!!

I used this recipe as inspiration and modified it.  I used jarred spaghetti sauce (meat flavored) and added it to the browned ground beef.  I added the oregano, basil, pepper and garlic powder to the cheese mixture instead. Didnt use the sugar or salt at all. I added more shreaded cheese to the top layer and baked until bubbly.  Delicious!

Really quite good!  I added olives and mushrooms and smoked sausage.  If you like really cheesy lasagna, double the cheeses.

This did not taste like something you would get from a restaurant. It was very dry. My family ate it but asked me not to make it again.

My family really liked this recipe.  The ricotta makes it very smooth.  My tastes would have had more red, i.e. tomato sauce, but that could be remedied by serving garlic bread with marinara alongside the lasagna!  :O).

This is great and not that hard to prepare.  The only thing I changed is that I doubled what it called for for the meat sauce. 1/2 pound of meat wouldn't have been enough.

I made this lasagna exactly as written except I could get ricotta cheese so I used bocconcini cheese. I also used a little more mozzarella cheese too. It was the best Lasagna I have ever had! No more ordering lasagna at restaurants for me :0)

I like this recipe although I enhanced it with 3 things: 1) 2 cloves of garlic (mmmmmmmmmmmm!) 2) red pepper flakes about a tsp; 3) non-nitrate breakfast sausage.  I don't like italian sausage and I can't eat nitrites so I put in about 4 patties of nitrite-free breakfast sausage - DELICIOUS!  

I realized with some of these recipes that I needed to add my own special touch regardless of whether the recipe called for it.  Enjoy!

I used Hunt's tomato sauce and a high quality mozzarella instead of a generic brand and it worked great.  I also doubled the meat and used bison instead of beef and added a little more tomato sauce.  I find this necessary since meat is not sold in halves of pounds and one large can of tomato sauce is more economical than three small ones.  It's more of a homestyle lasagna than a fancy-restaraunt style but it works very well.  Will be my new default lasagna recipe.

VERY WEAK recipe. Not much taste to sauce or meat.  Almost entirely a cheese taste.  If I went to a restaurant that served this lasagna, I'd send it back.

Made as written - like many reviewers I found there wasn't enough of the meat sauce. I also think the cheese is a bit much. I will play with this recipe to make it perfect, but as written it wasn't bad.

The flavor was excellent, but it turned out a little dry. Next time I'll add more tomato sauce. I did use no-boil whole wheat noodles from Target. Overall a really good recipe.

As a first time lasagna maker, this recipe was exceptional to follow and the result was absolutely delicious! I used no-boil lasagna to save a little time, so I added a thin layer of the sauce under the first layer of noodles before completing the rest of the layering, and it came out perfectly! I also added about 1 pound of sweet Italian sausage to make it a little meatier; this made the sauce just right so I think that if you stick with just the ground beef listed in the ingredients, your sauce may be a little runny. I also cooked it for about ten minutes longer than the suggested time, but that most likely just accounts for the no-boil noodles and of course differing ovens, I'm sure. Will definitely be making again!

This was REALLY good.  I gave it 4 stars because I did change a few things.  After reading the reviews I used a full pound of sweet Italian bulk sausage and more tomato sauce, and I upped the cheese.  The rest I did exactly as written and the family was very happy with it.
