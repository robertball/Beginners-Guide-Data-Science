My family is from the Winston-Salem area of NC.  My great grandmother used to make this.  It has been one of my favorite treats since I was little. Now my mom makes sure she brings me some back from Old Salem everytime she goes back to visit. Now I can make it myself and have it whenever I want. It taste just like grandma's.

I am not sure what exactly went wrong with this recipe, but it did not work out well at all.  The dough rose out of control.  There are several things that appear to have been incorrect:  too much yeast (most recipes would call for 2 teaspoons, not tablespoons; too much sugar for a yeast bread; incorrect pan size or description.  A 9X13 baking PAN would probably worked better than a 9X13 baking SHEET.  I may try this recipe again, but would like to know if I misinterpreted

I'm from Winston-Salem, too, and grew up with always having Dewey's sugar cake on Christmas morning. I've also worked in Old Salem and am quite familiar with the Moravian sugar cake from the wood-fired bakery there. This recipe is close, but not on the money. First, there is WAY too much cinnamon! I only made this recipe for the first time yesterday, so I don't know if 4 TEASPOONS is what is meant: I tried to follow the recipe, even though my gut told me it was too much cinnamon. Secondly, baking time needed to be more like 30-35 minutes. My oven is accurate. I don't think the Moravians would  put so much sugar, but it's good-tasting. I think the  dough recipe is close, but the finished product was doughy. Not sure if more cooking would have done it. Also, don't worry about making the holes in the dough too much. It works out, even tho it seems not to. I know the Dewey's version went to using margarine instead of butter, and for sure, not nearly so much cinnamon, but we always add more butter to the store-bought when we heat it up. However, doughy and over-spiced as this turned out, it will get eaten by the husband. Maybe if the finished product gets toasted in a pan, the doughy "cake" part will become less objectionable. My son thinks the store-bought stuff has too much dough, and not enough topping, but this recipe fixes that issue, with the ton of brown sugar and butter. I hope I have time to work on this again. It would be so cool to have the original taste, made at home.

This didn't turn out well for me; however, everyone ate it and some went for seconds.  The proportions seemed off and the final product was sour tasting to me (others didn't find that a problem).  Next time, I'll reduce the yeast by a third, use 2 c mashed potatoes and reduce the topping by half.
