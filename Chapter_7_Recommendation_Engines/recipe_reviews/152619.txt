I made it into a pie with an Oreo Cookie Crust.  Very good.  Hubby's favorite pudding.  Took to work for St. Patrick's Day.

My family said it was ok, but a little sweet. They all suggested either mint candies or cookies, but not both.

Love, love, love it!  It was so easy to make that my 5 year old did most of it.  I must say it was a great dessert to make together not to mention delicious!
