Lot of work here before you even turn on the slow cooker.  First, 4 tsp of salt plus 1 cup of olives (with lots of sodium) made this WAY too salty for us.  And I hate that because I have a ton of leftover sauce going into the freezer.  I'd recommend starting with 1 tsp salt and then adding to suit your taste because once it's in there, you can't take it out.  After 7 hours cooking, the consistency was too soupy to serve over pasta, so I added one 6-oz can of tomato paste which brought it to the right consistency.  I wouldn't bother with the 1/2 tsp cumin because it's just lost in a pot of sauce this large, and I wouldn't saute the parsley, just stir it into the sauce.  The recipe doesn't specify whether or not the cans of stewed tomatoes should be drained; I didn't drain them.  FYI, I used a 4-quart cooker, which was filled right up to the top.  Only change I made to this recipe was adding one teaspoon fennel seed, which I always add to spaghetti sauce.  We liked the flavor, and I'm giving 4 stars based on less salt and adding tomato paste.

Delicious

I made the recipe as published.  What I don't get is people taking off stars and not making the recipe as published.  I mean, people, if you have a different recipe post it, but don't change a recipe and say it wasn't good.  It's a 'recipe' for a reason. Changes you make and review are NOT the recipe as posted.  Makes it hard for interested cooks to get a good interpretation of the recipe *as posted*.

This was a little too soupy for my family's taste at the start.  (We like our sauce to cling to the pasta.)  The next time I added two cans of tomato paste and then thought it was much better.  So it is not too greasy after browning the sausage, onion and garlic in step 3, I put it all in a strainer and rinsed in warm water.  I then wiped out the pan with paper toweling before putting everything  back in the pan and proceeding to add white pepper, cumin and wine.  Now it's a real hit!

Excellent!!  Delicious!!  Superb!!  I used chardonnay b/c I didn't have red wine, bell pepper and zucchini instead of mushrooms, capers instead of olives, and chicken sausage instead of Italian b/c that's what I had on hand.  I'm not recommending changing things, but this recipe can definitely be adjusted easily to accommodate your preferences or the ingredients you have in the fridge!  The recipe is fabulous and  I will definitely be using it again.

This sauce is PHENOMENAL!!! I am not a fan of olives, so I left them out.  I put this all together at around 7:00pm and let it cook on low all night long.  The slow cooker finished "cooking" and reverted to the "warm" mode all day while I was at work.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper".
For the wine, I used a cabernet as the wine element... the flavor was rich, and with the cayenne pepper - YOWSAH! This sauce is fantastic!

This is at home in my slow cooker as I type, so I can't say anything yet about the finished product, but it looks promising! One change I'd definitely make though would be to cook the sausage and drain the fat before adding the onions, deglazing, etc. I used hot Italian sausage and after it had browned in the olive oil, there was quite a bit of grease that I wish wasn't in the final product.

I will likely try this recipe as it sounds really good and very adaptable. As for the texture of the sauce that some have commented on, marinara sauce from my understanding is more of a soupy-non clingy type of sauce- so this sauce is behaving as it should.

What a lot of measuring and work before even beginning to cook. The amount and the ingredients did not sound right but decided to try it based on some reviews â€“ too soupy and salty. Had to put this in the fridge and tried to rescue it later, making some additions.

Made this just as stated except for the olives (which my husband doesn't like). It is excellent and freezes well for future meals.

We actually thought this was pretty good.  We left out the salt because we allow others to season to their taste.  We like it!  My husband LOVED it!  He said 5*
and he doesn't give 5* very often :)
Thank you for sharing!

Made this for a meeting at our house.  Even though I cooked 2 boxes, I ran out of spaghetti, so one person just used some garlic bread to sop up a serving.  
I did modify it some.  I hate mushrooms and olives, so I left those out. I doubled the garlic, as we really love garlic.  My son doesn't like meat sauce, so I used meatballs instead of sausage, and added them with about an hour left to cook, after browning them in a skillet.  I did turn the cooker onto high heat for that last hour, as the meat balls were pretty big.
I thought it was a little thin, but everyone loved it. 
It was quite a bit of prep work to get it in, but well worth it. I have maybe a quart leftover, as I had also made an alfredo sauce, primarily for my daughter, but the others enjoyed it too.
Fed 9 adults, 1 teenage boy and 3 kids. Even the 6 month old got a few nibbles from his dad!

I make sauce all the time but I decided to try something different by using the slow cooker for a change. This sauce is excellent, Just make it as it is stated then add or delete whatever you want next time you make it -you Will make it again!

The stewed tomatoes were chunky in the sauce, that coupled with green olives, which I love but my kids do not and thus I would not necessarily say this is kid-friendly.  I only put 2 tsp of salt in.  I would half the white pepper to 1/2 tsp next time too, it was making me sweat from all that pepper (just 1 tsp too)!  But alas, I do like spicy so it was okay and I still ate two huge bowlfuls!

The reviews are great! I like different opinions and ideas myself. Overall I always look at recipes as a guide. I have this two thumbs up! The ingredients mixed well as the sauce bursted with flavors. The olives alone provided the perfect balance of salt, as well balanced out sweetness. Going to use the rest of sauce for different dishes that call for, such as lasagna.

Very good, as long as the meat is drained before adding to the rest of the sauce - I think it would be a little too greasy otherwise.

Loved smelling it cook all day.  I think I would cook it longer with the lid ajar to get it thicker, I like a thicker sauce.  This would be a wonderful dish to come home to at the end of the day.  Thanks for this!

I just want to say that I do agree with JoeK. If you have not made the sauce, don't comment, other wise if you did, then comment. I love looking at different recipes, but like Joe said, don't comment if you have not made it. Actually I do have my own sauce cooking right now which is a lot different then this one. 
Well everyone enjoy this sauce or your own.

I have a great sauce I make on the stovetop and this one could be too.  First thing I always look for with "Italian" sauce is does it use Italian sausage and are  brown sugar  and red wine incorporated?     Earmarks of a great sauce!    I leave out the olives and use only 1 tsp salt ( more can always be added).   The cumin in interesting.  Good for crock pot, good for stovetop.   Thank you for this recipe and especially  thank you for your service to the USA!

I've made this sauce so many times, felt like I needed to add a review.  I don't find it that much work--& like having all the work done early for a fabulous dinner later. Always enough left for great eating for several days (or many people!). Always rave reviews. Really don't change anything.  A GREAT keeper; thanks Robert!

Way too much work for a slow cooker recipe! I just dumped everything in the crock pot (including meat) and let it simmer, omitting the cayenne and pepper for personal preference, and also leaving out the salt and oil. The tomatoes had the salt I needed and the meat had the oil needed. I used stewed tomatoes as directed but they were a bit too large so next time I would use diced, as my gut told me. Unless you like your spaghetti sauce soupy, I would drain the tomatoes and/or cut down on the sauce. To make it healthier, a used a turkey/beef combo, with some fennel added in.

I added 1C parmesan/romano cheese and omitted olives and cumin, per my own tastes. I also reduced the salt to 1 tsp and added a 6oz can of tomato paste for thickening.

I did not add additional salt, seasoning with the spices plus my favorite Penzies combination was enough. 
I used a squirt of Agave syrup rather than brown sugar. 
It was nice not standing over the stove!

Will not lie, the first time you make this it will take longer than the 30 minutes prep unless you're a real whiz in the kitchen.  But it is so worth the effort.  So good, to the last drop.  The only difference is that we browned the sausage and drained it first, than after cooking the onions we put the sausage in to cut back on some of the fat, but it certainly did not take away from the flavor.   We then use this sauce for our crock pot lasagna!  So Good!  This sauce is so versatile! Add a salad and some crusty bread????? Yum!

This is the best spaghetti sauce I've had, seriously! One thing though, I like others was concerned with the amount of salt in the mix so made two adjustments. I used no salt added tomato sauce and 3 tsp (instead of 4) sea salt. I'm also vegetarian so omitted the sausage. So so good, flavorful, and very sophisticated. This will be my go to from now on!

Spent all that time in preparation, cooked all day and it was watery, due to the wine, was far too much many  tomatoes, will never make again.  Plus, I had made it for company that night and was embarrassed that it was so watery.

Yes I made this but instead of using green olives I use black olives because I don't like green olives and then I did the mushrooms and parsley and I waited until that was done and then I put it in another bowl and then I use the same pan and did the rest in the same pan and it came out delicious everybody loved it sorry I forgot to take a picture but I will next time honest on a rating scale from 1 to 5 and 5 being the best. I give it a 5
