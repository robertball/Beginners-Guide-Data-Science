I really liked this recipe. Not the right time of year for parsnips so I used carrots instead. Hadn't heard of that fish so I used Tarakihi which is a firm white fish. Also used my own homemade chicken stock. Flavour is very nice and the thyme and basil work well together which suprised me.

This is a lovely recipe for walleye and I highly recommend it.  Used fish stock rather than the chicken stock.  Really enjoyed the crunchiness of the bean spouts and the fresh ginger and spices.  Could have put more fish into the soup as it adds a perfect balance to the spiciness.  It was a 33c August day, when I made this but my husband and I till enjoyed the heat of the soup while outside at the lake.
