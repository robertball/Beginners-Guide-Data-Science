Although I have used this website for quite some time to obtain recipes, this is my first review.  I used my own fresh grown rosemary, added a little bit of fresh grown greek oregeno & lemon juice (as one other reviewer suggested) & used it on bone-in chicken breasts and grilled.  Not only were these moist but also had a fantastic flavor. If grilled correctly, I can't imagine anyone not being completely 100% satisfied with the results!

I used this rub on chicken. I did cut back on on the salt just a bit. I stuffed my chicken with a quartered lemon and half of an onion, quartered. It came out juicy and just HUGELY flavorful. Very very good. I'll use this rub again.

Fantastic!  I've tried it on chicken breasts and potatos, but use less salt when cooking it with chicken.

  Also works well if you add fresh lemon juice.  


I leave out the dried rosemary and just use fresh...this one is a keeper, thanks!

Excellent rub.  I cut the recipe in half and I used it on T-bone steaks.  Bring the steaks to room temp. before grilling and they'll come out nice and tender.

This rub produced a meal that was bursting with flavor.  I used fresh rosemary from the garden, but omitted the dried rosemary.  I halved the recipe, which was perfect for one whole chicken, cut in pieces.

Just too salty for us.  I will use 1/2 the amount and it will be delicious.  Flavor was good, but for the salt. We had it on pork chops and I will definitely try it on chicken.

My wife liked it well enough, but frankly, I thought this was pretty nondescript and no big deal.  I used this on bone-in chicken breasts which I cooked to perfection on the charcoal grill, but this rub was no more "stand-out" or memorable than any other rub or seasoning.  And even that is after reducing the amount of salt considerably (and I did use Kosher salt, not table salt, as directed).

Loved it! I reduced the salt and pepper a little. After putting the rub on boneless pork chops, I let them sit out of the refrigerator for about 45 minutes before grilling. Husband and I both thought they were outstanding. I will try this out on other meats but thought it was especially good with the pork.

Rubbed this over beef ribeye steaks and grilled them.  It really complemented the flavor of the steaks. Use fresh rosemary whenever possible for the best flavor. Next, I plan to use this on a beer can chicken.

Easy rub that adds nice flavor.  I used this on steaks and par-boiled potatoes.  The rosemary pairs extremely well with beef.

I used this on chicken and it was super flavorful! I was able to use up the last of my dried rosemary (something I've been trying to do for a while now). Next time I will just use all fresh rosemary. A recipe that was simple and great!

Used this on filet mignon and husband and I loved the flavors. I followed the recipe except I decreased the amount of salt (reg table salt)to only a 1/2 tsp and that was plenty for me and I am salt lover. I also pureed( dried roemary doesn't taste good grilled &  the kids don't like it crunchy)  the mixture and basted while grilling. This recipe is a keeper.

Wonderful rub!  This really makes a chicken outstanding.  I put a lot of the rub under the skin and it soaked in a lot of the flavor.

we used this on our prime rib roast for Christmas and it was wonderful! I just stuff it all into the food processor and blend it all up really good- saves the time of chopping into itty bitty pieces! Its also good if you add some parsley and lemon juice to it. For a spicy kick, add some horseradish! :)

fantastic!  I used 1.5 times the recipe, and only used dried rosemary (didn't have fresh) and then rubbed it over a 5 pound chicken.  smells coming from the oven were delicious and the chicken came out heavenly.  beautiful addition to any meats :)

Loved this on rib eyes! It adds loads of flavor w/out overpowering the beef. I decreased the salt & oil some because I used all the rub on just 2 steaks. A glass of pinot noir & a simple salad w/ vidalia onion vinaigrette was all the accompaniments it needed....thanks!

Outstanding! I didn't have fresh rosemary so I upped the dried rosemary and added a little oregano. My family loved this and I used this on 4 steaks, I thought the amount of salt was fine and the amount of oil was fine for the steaks. When pushed for time and there wasn't time for a marinade, this fits the bill  nicely. I highly recommend. I can't wait to try with fresh rosemary. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half since it was just for two, but now I wish I had made the full recipe so we could have it again!
 I've been looking for just the right recipe for Rosemary & garlic chicken, and this is it!!

I used this rub for a whole, stuffed chicken that I made recently. I put the rub under the chicken skin prior to cooking--it really infused the meat with a nice taste. Will use again.

This was excellent!  I love rosemary, I love garlic, and this was perfect.  I was just cooking for myself and used a large chicken thigh with skin, I put some of the rub right on the meat, and some on the skin.  I can't wait to use it again.

WOW!!  I used this on some pork chops and pork steaks i was grilling a couple of days ago, and It was GREAT!!  I just added about a teaspoon (or a little more) of melted butter and a few drops of 'louisiana hot sauce'.. since its not as hot as tabasco.. lol anyway thanks SOO much for this recipe, it was AWESOME

Really tasty. I cut the olive oil way back and used this on potatoes. I just baked them in the oven and they came out tender and tasty!

I used 4 Tablespoons of Fresh Rosemary instead of the 3 Fresh 1 Dry. It was wonderful. I Put it on chicken, that I that pounded flat with a mallet, and baked at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes.

Holy Cow!!!! This was sooo good!!  I put the ingredients into a small food processor (a little too much oil)  using half the salt and 6 lg cloves of garlic.  I baked it in the oven and it was A-MAZE-ING!

Good base recipe...DO NOT use that much salt!  I actually have now made this rub using no salt at all.  You really don't need it, as the rosemary and the garlic add great flavor.

Made the rub as specified, used garlic paste (8 1/2 tsp) and added just a squeeze of lemon on the chicken. I used half on two chicken breasts. The rest I added 2 TBsp olive oil and sprinkled over two red potatoes I cut into small pieces and cooked on Broil. SOOOOO good! Thanks for sharing, my boyfriend actually said, "Whatever you don't want to eat, I will!" This is in permanent rotation, but I might cut back a tiny bit on the salt, it was a teensy bit overwhelming.

This was my first time using a rub, I added a 1/2 tblsp of Allspice and 1/2 a medium white onion [chopped]. Used it on a whole chicken, and roasted it. PERFECT!!!

I will definitely make this again.  I only used dried herbs and it still came out good.  My 5 and 3 year old even liked it!  This is a great recipe if you are looking for something quick, flavorful and healthy.

I used all fresh rosemary and skipped the dried and tossed in some fresh parsley because....well why not? I was out of fresh garlic so I subbed garlic powder but next time I will try the fresh. I coated my meat with the oil and then rubbed the combined ingredients on a venison roast before slow roasting. Yum!

A nice rub. I added thyme because I have all my own fresh ingredients dried from my herb garden. The pork blade roast came out juicy and fell off the bone.

I have been using this recipe on my chicken for awhile now. I have no complaints and made it exactly as it says. I use it when I want to roast a whole chicken. I put the rub inside the bird and outside. Super tasty. Fresh rosemary is key to this rub. It smells so good as the chicken is cooking away. Highly recommend

Good, but spicy, like the fresh taste of rosemary was good, next time will cut down on the pepper. I used it on chicken tenders and grilled them on the bbq, turned out nicely.

Great rub.  It's salty, but if you're the type who salts their fast food fries, it's nothing you can't handle. I used it on grilled potatoes, although I had trouble preventing the potatoes from falling apart on the grill.  It's probably best not to flip over but once.  Excellent rub though.

This was really good.  I put these on some rib eyes and let them sit over night in fridge.  Took them out of fridge 1/2 hr before cooking.  Cooked on really high heat for a minute or two on each side, then moved to indirect heat for about 5-6 minutes each side.  Perfect medium-rare.  Loved the flavor but I think I would used just a little bit less salt, but still a great rub
