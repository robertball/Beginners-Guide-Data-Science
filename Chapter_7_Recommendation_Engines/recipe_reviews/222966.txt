I did not have the garlic cooking creme, just the original plain cooking creme. I did fold in two cloves fresh minced garlic as well as a handful of fresh chives and a little fresh ground pepper. I used white WINE vinegar in this recipe. I made no other changes. I never would have thought to use cream cheese in a broccoli salad--it's really something. The proportions of all the ingredients were spot on. Absolutely delicious. This is my new favorite broccoli salad.

Awesome!  However keep in mind that I love vinegar and this thing has a real zing to it.  The family all thought it was too vinegary so I added some mayo to cut it for them and they loved it then.  I will try to make it again later this week and cut the vinegar back to 1 TBS.

yummi. this stuff was even better the next day. I happen to have some raisins, so I put them in instead on sunflower seads. The little sweetness goes well with the tangy garlicness.

This is the same recipe as I use.  Some days I add shredded cheese, cashews, fresh diced tomatoes and ham ( not all at once). Try it as written first.  Then have fun and add or subtract to recipe.  You'll love it

I was not very impressed. One, I didn't think that there was nearly enough liquid components. The cream was so think, I could hardly even get to spread on the broccoli. And, I thought there was a major lack of flavor. You could taste garlic, but that's it. I ended up adding a bottle of Cesar dressing, more shredded cheese, feta cheese, and a package of Craisins. It ended up being a big hit, but it hardly resembled the original.

I have some fussy eaters so I didn't include the onions and used only 2 tablespoons of vinegar! But this recipe is great!

Used fried bacon broken into pieces and didn't use sunflower seeds. Fantastic!
