I didnt personally make this, my husband's aunt did...but I HAD to come here and get the recipe. I cant believe no one has reviewed this yet!! It is phenomenal!! We had this at our memorial day get together and there was none left!! I am going to make it for my husband bc he didnt get to try any bc it went so fast!! This was so refreshing to have something new to dip in, other than the traditional ranch and salsa. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!

I made this for a family bbq and it was a huge hit.  Everyone couldn't leave the bowl alone.

This is a nice change from regular salsa.  It would be great to offer this as one of several salsa options for chips!  I didn't have the Mexican Style chili powder, but it was great with regular chili powder as well.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

I tried this today because I had all the ingredients in the house and had to take something to a pot luck. It was only fair. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly and thought it was kind of odd. There was something about the amount of cream cheese with the salsa that just didn't taste right. It was not popular with others either. I probably will not make it again.
