We followed this recipe completely for our first attempt at Fried Green Tomatoes.  We found them a bit bland and the coating to thin for our taste.  The second time around we seasoned the breading with some garlic powder, red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.  After double dippin in the egg and breading mix... we loved the final result!

This is a very good recipe! Fast and easy! I served a platter of tomatoes with individual bowls of toppings such as sour cream, grated cheese, tiny chopped green onions, shredded cheese, ect. It was a great hit! My thanks to Robin! Arizona Joan

I hope when people come looking for fried green tomato recipes they continue until they find this one! While crispy coating and crunchy texture is awesome on fried chicken, fried green tomatoes are best with a lighter batter and a slight softness, in my opinion.  :o)  This recipe provides that perfectly.  In following my own mom and grandma, I use part butter and part canola oil when frying ... the butter adds a nice flavor.  Just be careful not to burn! Once our tomatoes are coated and in the pan, we also sprinkled with a little white sugar. Flipping to spirnkle both sides.  You could do this from the flour stage; mix it in, but I do what I have seen done before me. The end result is a soft fried texture with these bits of carmelized sugar that just play perfectly with the slight tartness of the green tomato.  Love them!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe and letting folks know cornmeal isn't the only way to an awesome fried green tomato!!

This was a great recipe!  They taste just like my mother's.  I live alone so I only used one tomato and cut the other ingredients in half for a single's dinner.

These were perfect for my green tomatoes that fell of the plant.  I used egg beaters instead of the eggs and fried in canola oil.  Very yummy and the tart flavor is perfect.  Thank you for this method and ingredients!

on our farm in nys all through my childhood this is THE recipe we used. it's cheap, delicious,and with a garden that produces enough veggies for ma to can 400 quarts of veggies each year to feed 8 through the winter months, tomatoes were abundent. the only thing i do differently is fry them until they are really browned on each side.

very easy and tasty! my husband and i made these for the first time ever tonight, and they turned out great; crispy and tender. we salted and peppered them as they were draining on a thick layer of paper towels. yields a heckuva lot of FGT, so make sure you've got a crowd.

So good. This is an examle of how simple is sometimes perfect! Easiest recipe ever. I added a shake of red pepper flakes and cooked way longer than two minutes. I like them a dark golden brown.

I have tried these and another recipe from this sight. Both are excellent and I do add cajun seasoning to the breading and use some bacon grease. I use this recipe if I am out or cornmeal. Both recipes are good. I do tweak mine b/c I like the added kick of cajun seasoning. You can't go wrong with this recipe!!!!! Another great hit with my family!!!!
