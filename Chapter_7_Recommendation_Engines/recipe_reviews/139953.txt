Looking at the reviews beforehand I suppose would have been wise, but you shouldn't have to consult reviews in a published recipe, in my opinion, to avert disaster.  The crust, okay, so you can't go wrong if you buy one.  I chose to make my own - just as easy, probably cheaper, and tastes better and fresher: 1-1/4 c. graham cracker crumbs, 5 T. melted butter, 2 T. sugar - in a 9" springform pan.  The cheesecake filling is standard - can't go wrong there either.  But the topping...  what a watery mess.  Either reduce the nectar, probably by half, or increase the cornstarch, probably by double.  If you don't you'll end up having to do what I did and have to struggle to fix this after the fact.  Also, I don't undertstand the reason for tossing the boiling hot juice with the fresh mango - -unless you're trying to cook the mango (not). Once done, this is very good as well as pretty -  four stars for sure.  On its own, prepared as the recipe directs? - a store bought crust with a basic cheesecake filling topped with chopped mangoes suspended in juice.  And, given what you'd end up with, three stars is generous, two stars is more accurate, but I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this recipe with some important modifications.

Can I give this one another star? It really is an awesome and easy cheesecake. The mango topping is to die for and so easy to make! Don't be afraid to work with fresh mangoes even if you're not accustomed to them. The fresh ones really beat canned ones anyday. I usually buy desserts but saw this recipe and decided to try it. It was easy and got rave reviews from my family and friends. Now I have to make mango cheesecake at least once a month or I start hearing alot of complaining about how I never make mango cheesecake anymore! Thanks TNARINESINGH. You rock!

It is a creamy cheesecake, i love that!! its very important to disolve the mango nectar & sugar and not overheating the ripe mango because if you over heat the mango would not look fresh. I would be making it again!!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly (it's so simple it would be hard to alter it) and I will definitely make it again.  My only issue is there was too much syrup, so next time before adding the chopped mangoes I'll scoop out about 1/3 cup (easier than recalculating the nectar-sugar-cornstarch ratio).  It took about 40 minutes in my oven.

This cheesecake was very creamy, light  and delicious.  I made the graham cracker crust in a springform pan.  A standard crust recipe is too much for this cheesecake, so if you decide to make your own crust, use only about 3/4 of the crumbs and bring them up the pan sides only halfway.  For the topping, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup -and drizzled it on top of each piece before serving.  My family loved it!

Great cheesecake recipe!  My only mistake was letting the mango sauce sit for a while until the cheesecake chilled.  It got watery.

Amazing. I have to agree with one of the others, to much nectar. I'd make what it says, add it to my mangos, scoop them out with a slitted spoon, then drizzle the necter on the cheese cake. Will maek again.

For a baked chessecake this one was very creamy.  Everyone loved it! 

The mango sauce was good, but not fantastic - it was a bit too much like canned pie filling.

I would make this again - but somehow try and improve the sauce.

I am a huge mango fan and this does the job.  I has such a fresh flavor and is not overly sweet which is one of the reasons I like Mangos.

I would have to say i did not have luck with this recipe. i followed the recipe EXACTLY and it turned out super mushy in the center. Not even 25% of it was edible.  The sauce was too sweet and the cornstarch forms balls! I had to spoon out the balls of cornstarch.  I do not recommend this recipe!

Made own crust with digestive biscuits. Cheesecake was perfectly baked after 30 mins. Pureed fresh mango to make nectar but tasted odd cos i added cornflour (not cornstarch as requested). Omitted the sauce and just topped it with diced fresh mango. Still delish!!

Excellent recipe, I added chopped macadamian nuts to the cheese mixture before baking & used digestive biscuits instead of graham crackers. We didnt have mango nectar so used canned mangoes for the sauce and fresh mangoes on the top. Dh ate the entire cake in 24 hours. Said he loved it. Taste better than the deli. Thank you Trini !!! Will be making it again this weekend.

Tried this recipe to use up the mango nectar languishing for months in the pantry. I'm glad I did as this is heavenly! And quite addictive too, even to non-sweet tooths.

I would have taken a photo but mine couldn't hold its shape after cutting it from the pan. Perhaps next time I'd experiment with some gelatine to hold the toppings together. Otherwise, it's awesome. Thanks for sharing!

Well my husband LOVED it! I just ate one slice - my husband ate the rest (it made me sick the first slice since I have a sensitive stomach). 

Just make the regular amount of syrup, but refrigerate or freeze about half of it. Only use the amount that looks appropriate for the cheesecake or it'll drown.

It was really good..i was careful not overdoing the sweetness of th e mango sauce. I only used abot 1/4 cup of the sugar and mixed in about 1/4 cup of cream. The cream balances the sweetness of themango nectar and sugar. The first time i made this heesecake, i used mango jam because there was no available nectar and mixed it in with the cream to not overdo the sweetness so much. I liked the mixture with additinal cream.Thanks for the great recipe. I made it as a surprise to friends and family.

The recipe didn't say in what type of pan to bake this other than suggesting to use a pre-made crust (pie plate)?  I used a standard cheesecake springform pan w/removable bottom and cut back on the amount of graham cracker crumbs for the crust to 1 C. as suggested.  There was very little filling, maybe 3/4' which looked odd.  I liked it and thought the topping was great, but my company didn't finish theirs.  Most recipes have sour cream so not sure what went wrong here.  If you're going to make it, use a pie plate or use another recipe for the cheesecake with this topping.  I won't be making again.

Good, simple recipe. As I live in Malaysia and mangoes are abundant at this time of the year, I used fresh mango puree instead of the nectar. I used around 1/4 cup of sugar and about 2tbs of lemon juice (no cornstarch needed).  simply fabulous! Thank you so much for the recipe.

I made only the Mango Topping with a separate cheesecake recipe.  The topping was quite tasty, but a tad on the watery side.  If I make this again, I will definitely cut down on the liquid measurement or possibly add more cornstarch to further thicken.  It got rave reviews from all the happy tasters though!  Thanks for the recipe!

Sauce is very running. Use strainer or ladle to put the mango on top. Save the extra in a bowl.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The cheesecake is easy but delicious and the mango topping really ties it all together into a scrumptious treat.  Thanks for a great recipe!
