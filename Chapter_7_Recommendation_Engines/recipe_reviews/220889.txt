My great grandmother used to make this every year at Xmas.  In addition to the peanut butter kind she would drop by spoonfulls and put a candied cherry or walnut in the middle.  Coconut can be added as well.  This candy says Christmas to me!  And btw I'm from Ohio too!!

These are exactly what I was looking for. I followed the recipe with no changes and love it. I did have trouble rolling it up without breaking the dough but that will just take some practice on my part. Very tasty!

My first attempt at this recipe.  Turned out great!  I have been looking for this recipe forever...I remember my grandmother making it when I was young.  We lived in Ohio at the time.  Made me wonder if this was a buckeye treat..haha.  Anyway, thank you sooo much, it really took me back to a happy place!

I love using this recipe; a former housemate showed me how to make potato candy, but I take it one step further.  I melt chocolate in a double boiler and drizzle some of it over the peanut butter before rolling the potato mix up, and then after the candy has been rolled, cut, and chilled, I'll either dip the candy into some of the melted chocolate or drizzle more chocolate over the candy pieces.

Yummy.  My Dad use to make these at Christmas time for us as kids.  Unless you tell folks, they'll never know you use mashed potatoes.  Brings back sweet memories.

Potato candy has been a holiday tradition in my family for a very long time. You can make mashed potatoes from the dry flakes and it works well, too. I make it with both smooth and crunchy peanut butter. I also use Nutella, which is really good. There is a natural brand of peanut butters called Wild Friends - they have a chocolate-coconut peanut butter, and a cinnamon raisin peanut butter that is also good in this. My mother used to mix cream cheese or apple butter with the peanut butter. This is also good.

Thanks for posting this.  I haven't made this in 35 yrs, so I needed to refresh my memory.  I made this when I lived in Wheeling, WV.  To the reviewer who thought it a bit dry, try mixing in a bit more mashed potato.

Recipe was very easy to follow and came out perfectly! I dusted with powdered sugar after I cut the roll up and placed back in the refrigerator before giving to a woman who missed her mother making this for her since she passed away.

This recipe must be regional as my mother is from Indiana and we had it growing up. Make sure your slices are thin....it's very rich!

For those of you having problems with the rolling. Roll onto a sheet of parchment or wax paper then as you roll peel paper off. I hope I described that correctly. It works for me.

Unfortunately, the pototo I used left very tiny hunks of potato in the mixture, which I found very unappetizing in what should be a smooth confection.

The flavor was good but I followed this recipe just how it was directed and it was too dry, this was my first attempt at making this candy so I will definitely make some changes the next time.

When I was growing up in West Virginia, my Mother used to make this candy at Christmas time. She would make two batches, one batch she would use food coloring and color it green, the other batch with food coloring would be pink. When you sliced the roll, the peanut butter color stood out with the pink and green and it made a real cute Christmas candy. I have made it a couple times and it's real tasty.
