These reviews are seriously entertaining. I just saw the main rating and made the cookies before reading all of the reviews. Had I read these first, I probably would not have made these.  I actually followed the recipe to the T on the first pan...and they came out actually looking perfect, but tasting really bland...and they weren't at all chewy. I added 1/4 flour and 1/2 more peanut butter to what was left for the rest of the cookies and only cooked them for 15 mintues. AFter that, they were PERFECT!!!!! And NOW...after all of the changes, they can officially be called SOFT AND CHEWY PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES.

If I had more thumbs they would all be way, way up for this one. I was skeptical after reading other reviews, but decided to go with the recipe as is. The only thing I did different was added a small bag of semi-sweet chocolate chunks and a small bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. They are, as someone else described, an unusual consistancy before dropping onto pan. Very gooey and it did take the full 22 minutes...no matter how Narly they look at first. keep the balls/drops no bigger than a tablespoon as they do spread out like flat gobs of goo. In the last 7 minutes they miraculously take cookie form, it's amazing because they really do stay gooey looking for a while. I think if you turn the tempature up higher the dough edges will burn, so don't be tempted. a bit sweet, but what a perfect cookie. exactly what I was looking for and my male co-workers said they were orgasmic. The finished cookie looks just like a cookie you'ld buy at Mrs. Smiths in the mall. I won't be using any other peanut butter cookie recipe again. Thanks. P.S. If the peanut butter flavor isn't strong enough for you, it is mild, don't touch the recipe, I'd recommend just adding nuts or peanut butter chips. They stay soft & chewy longer than any cookies I've ever made. I made these twice now, and refridgerated the dough before baking the second time, much easier to ball, came out exactly the same. Yum!

The first time i made these cookies they came out very flat, not too pretty but still had a good taste.  I decided to make them again but this time added 1/4 c. more flour, a bit more peanut butter, chilled the dough, rolled them into tiny balls and did not press them with a fork....wow...after doing that they came out awesome!  Few changes needed to satisfy my personal taste but it worked out because everyone loves them!  Overall great recipe, thanks :)

This is an excellent peanut butter cookie. I have tried several recipes looking for something that would produce a softer cookie. This is definitely a keeper! Make sure to follow the recipe exact and you will get flawless results.

This is the best recipe yet!  I followed recipe expcept I refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes.  I used my Pampered Chef cookie scoop to create perfect sized balls.  I rolled each ball in sugar.  I baked them for about 19 minutes and pressed candied cherries in some, (husbands request) and hershey kisses in the rest.  DELICIOUS! Moist and picture perfect!  I disagree with others.  I thought they had the perfect amount of pb.

This recipe is bad. The dough was not dough... more like pancake mix, and the cookies turned out just so.  They stuck to the pan.  I added 1 cup more flour and that did nothing.  Wish I would have never tried these ones : (

The ingredients are way off on this recipe--3 eggs is too many for amount of flour, and the 1 1/4 each of white and brown sugar is really too much.  Not a good recipe at all in my opinion.  Not worth taking time to change it.

not tasty, too runny cant make into balls without adding extra flour. then you also need to add extra peanut butter for flavor,  gets hard if cooked for 14 minutes.  just not worth the hassle.. find another recipe..

These cookies come out just fine, I didn't have to add anything, they are soft and chewy, though I agree that once you mark them with the fork, even if every so lightly, they become VERY flat.  Otherwise, very tasty cookie, although I don't understand the serving size... it says 18 servings, is that 18 cookies? I got 6 dozen! Also, my cooking time averaged about 13 minutes also.

These cookies were better than any other recipe for pb cookies I have ever tried, and I have tried many looking for just he right chewy texture. Having taught home economics classes I have just a couple of suggestions for my fellow cookie bakers. First of all, I never mix cookies with a mixer. I learned from experience to just use a wooden spoon to mix the butter and sugar and the rest of the batter. It makes a world of difference. Over mixing dissolves the sugar too much and makes the dough more runny. For this recipe I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 cup more of flour since the flour I use is presifted. Then since the dough was still quite soft, I put it out on waxed paper and created a roll in the waxed paper and froze it before slicing, rolling and baking. I made balls about 1 1/4" in diameter, and did not mash with a fork. I also baked at a higher temperature (375 degrees) for about 10-11 minutes b/c I like them to be crispy on the outside and little less done on the inside for the chewiness. My hubby and I LOVE these cookies! :-)

I've been using this recipe for many years so I'm confident the recipe itself is reliable and very good.  For those of you having trouble I can share my own misadventures and perhaps it will help.  I tried cheating once and substituted Jif with a store brand peanut butter and I knew by the dough something was wrong because the dough was too wet and oily.  The cookies spread too much and came out flat, crunchy, and oily.  I went back to the store and made a second batch with Jif and that solved the problem.  This dough is best when refrigerated overnight so the flour can thoroughly absorb the moisture.  Different brands of butter have different levels of water content so I always use Land O' Lakes brand.  Another ingredient that can ruin certain baked goods is the kind of sugar.  Beet sugar can ruin a good cookie so use cane sugar.  That applies to brown sugar as well.  If you want a stronger peanut taste without adding more oil using peanut butter you can use your food processor and pulse a cup of salted, roasted peanuts until you have a bread crumb like consistency, and then gently fold them into your dough as your last step.  Remember, butter is butter, and margarine is oil, so use real butter.  I hope this helps and happy baking!!

I was looking for a recipe to make for my hubby and kids (I do not like peanut butter cookies).  BUT OMG!  These were outstanding!  They were soft and chewy and really tasty!  Do make sure to use 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 c of flour and only 2 eggs, or they spread out and get too crunchy/burnt, and also VERY important...only cook for 12-13 minutes if your oven temperature runs correctly.  They will not look done at first, but let them sit in the pan for 1-2 minutes and then put them on a cooling rack, they turn out PERFECT!  I will never make another pb cookie again, and we are making the recipe now for the second time this week! LOL

This is the first time I have ever had to throw out cookie batter. I added a little extra flour as recommended by previous reviewers, but as they also said, it didn't make them better. Not peanut buttery at all, and bland. Thought I'd give it a chance, but now I don't have cookies to take for my meeting tomorrow.

I have been making these cookies for years! They are so yummy! I use the exact recipe but with these revisions. I reduce the amount of both sugars to 3/4 cup each, add 1 ten ounce pkg of peanut butter chips at the end of mixing the dough, and chill for maybe 30 to 60 minutes. Then I bake (preheated oven) at 350 for 7-9 minutes or until edges are brown. Always turn out perfectly!!

I did what others have suggested -- added 1/4 c flour, omitted 1 egg, added 3 TBS peanut butter, used Jif instead of a sugar-free version, added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and an entire bag of milk chocolate chips.  (Milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet so they'd taste like peanut butter cups.)  Also rolled into walnut-sized balls, didn't criss-cross with a fork, and baked for 13 minutes.  Whew!  That being said, these were really great cookies!  I realize that I'm reviewing the revised version but these revisions aren't that far off the original recipe so it's still valid.  Chewy, light crispiness on the edges, lovely flavor, nice and peanutty without being cloying, and this recipe made 6 1/2 dozen cookies so beware!  Unless you're making them HUGE, I can't imagine how it would make only 3 dozen cookies, though adding the chips would add several cookies to the batch.  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thanks, Sarah!

FINALLY!!! I have been looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe forever.  Well, of course I have found plenty, but none that lived up to their name of soft and chewy.  My dad always loved the cookies I would bring home from the school cafeteria when I was younger.  They were moist, chewy and super peanut buttery.  Well I've been on a 6 year quest to reproduce these for him.  All of the other recipes I've tried were only soft for about 5 minutes after baking, and then turned to rocks, but these are still soft even now (a day later).  I am so excited.  By the way I doubled the amount of peanut butter and vanilla... FANTASTIC!!! Thank you for this recipe.  And to the people who said these weren't good, you should give them another try... maybe you did something wrong!!!

These were sooooo good, just the recipe I had been looking for.  I did add just a little extra peanut butter (rounded cup instead of level), otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I did use real butter and Jif Peanut Butter, not sure if this would make a difference in why some people might have better results than others, but could be.  Noticed a baking time issue in some of the reviews and just for extra info, mine were done in 17 minutes.

Delicious!  "Soft and Chewy," just the way I like them (not even the edges were crispy!).  I did, however, follow some other recommendations and added a little more flour (no more than 1/4 cup) and only used 2 eggs.  I used all natural peanut butter (but skimmed off some of the oil)and half of the butter (1 stick) was unsalted. I baked them at around 300 degrees for 18-20 min.  Next time I might take them out a few minutes sooner so they'll be a little more gooey.  Definitely will be my peanut butter cookie of choice from now on.

Just as most of us do, we need to check the freshness of the baking sodas and baking powders
in our cupboards, to check is easy - drop one teaspoon in a cup of water and see if it bubbles.
These items have a short shelf life after they're 
opened! Also ovens We can't forget to check the
operations of them, some tempertures are not what is showing on the settings. Some cook hotter or even cooler than the temperture settings. Have it checked by an authorized technician once a year!
Good luck and keep an eye some recipes from me.

My boyfriend and I LOVE these cookies! I dont understand why it got the couple one star ratings below.  It had great peanut butter flavor and even though the dough is a bit gooey, they turned out great and not super thin or anything.  The first time that I made them they were really really thin and brittle and I finally realized why; I checked the date on my baking soda and it was like 8 months expired! I got new soda and it solved everything.  I really recommend these!

Spectacular!  I'm not the greatest cook and was looking for a basic, tasty peanut butter cookie recipe.  The reviews sold me on this one, and they were right.  After reading all the suggestions, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were marvelous.  They stayed soft and chewey for a long time in the cookie jar (hiding from the kids, who would have eaten them all right away), and now that they're gone, I'm craving them again!

Very tasty cookies! They had a good flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, but lowered cooking time to 15 minutes. That was plenty of time. They are a tad "powdery", so next time I will use just a little less flour. Definitely a keeper, though. Thanks!

Excellent recipe! As suggested by some of the reviews, I also used only 2 eggs, +1/4 cup flour and about +3T extra peanut butter.  I baked at 300 degrees, as directed, but for only 15 minutes.  I waited one minute before removing from cookie sheet. The cookies came out soft and chewy! Yum Yum!  However, after storing them overnight in plastic ziploc containers, they became crispy. Anybody have any suggestions to maintain the soft and chewy texture?  My grandmother always put a piece of bread in her cookie "jar" to keep her cookies soft.  I will try this next time.  I think I will also try baking them 12-13 minutes.  Despite these minor issues, this recipe is already in my "Favorite Recipes" box!  Thanks Sarah!

I didn't read the review before I made these and my first pan full turned out very flat so I used about 1/4 cup of flour to the batter and it turn out alot better. I think they are very good and just the right amount of peanut butter. I like that they really turned out soft and chewy like the recipe said.

extremely good! they stay soft, even when overcooked (my husband likes it overcooked). :) I will keep this in my favorites for the next time I make some. I don't know why some people said it wasn't good, because I followed everything exactly and they turned out perfect!

Thinking it was going to be like pancake batter I started making it in my Ninja I ended up transfering to a bowl and got nice "DOUGHY" mix. I used XL eggs and an all natural peanut butter (it comes with a layer of peanut oil on top I highly suggest emptying the jar and mixing it very well) Maybe it has something to do with your peanut butter?? I can't imagine why people are getting thin dough. I also added chocolate chips. (Tip: if you are low on flour you can use oatmeal instead, tastes just fine in cookies. Just grind it up very well. No baking powder? 1 tsp baking powder = 1/4 tsp baking soda + 1/2 tsp cream of tartar Those were two "uh-ohs" I saw) 4 stars because the taste is lacking. Not gross, but not ... peanut butter cookie flavored

They don't even taste like peanut butter... and they get hard  after a few hours.  The next door neighbor's kid had one bite and put it back down, not to return, and came up with an excuse about why he didn't want it.  

Someone here suggested adding 1/2 more peanut butter and 1/2 more flour.  I did with the part of my batter that I didn't cook last night.. and NOW they're really good and stay soft. (Not to mention actually taste like peanut butter..) If you do THAT, you'll have an EXCELLENT peanut butter cookie!!  Great save!!

I just finished making these cookies and they are soft and chewy. I followed the recipe exactly as written. After rolling the dough balls, I coated them with sugar and baked them for 20 minutes.   This is a definite keeper!!!

These are the best pb cookies ever. People should really just try to follow the recipe and directions before they rate them.  I was pretty optimistic about this one and made a double batch. They were soft and chewy and delicious. I will be following the recipe and instructions as is.

I love this recipe as does everyone in my family, I have made it as is (adding more flour because of my altitude), I have added chocolate chips, and tried different types of extract.  They always turn out great I can even give them a bit more of a  peanut butter kick by adding peanut butter chips mmm tasty its a good basic recipe that will allow you to experiment without to many unknowns!!

I modified this recipe.  I added an extra half cup of flour and peanut butter.  I also substituted all of the white sugar with brown sugar.  The balls of dough were easy to form.  My kids even helped with making the cookies.  I only baked the cookies until they were "done enough" to be moved on to a plate with a metal spatula, not until the bottoms were browned, they finished cooking during the cooling process.

Personally, I absolutely love a nice, chewy, soft cookie. I was never all too fond of peanut butter cookies because the always seem to turn out so crunchy and hard. These cookies, however, were absolutely the perfect cookie. I brought them to a party and had people begging for more. I made some for my family and they were gone in hours. Awesome recipe. A few changes: i added an extra half cup of flour and found that they turned out better. I also rolled the balls of cookie dough in granulated sugar before putting them on the cookie sheet, and I didn't make fork imprints, they spread fine on their own. Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be sure to make this one again soon.

Suggested changes: Add 1/2 c whole wheat baking flour (approx) to make it more dough-like and less batter-like.  Esp if using natural PB which has more oil. Do NOT smash with fork - cookies will flatten sufficiently on own Use rounded scoop from melon baller, not ice cream scoop, for better sized cookies chill dough while waiting to put it on the cookie sheet cool them on paper bag to maintain chewiness and absorb some of the pb oil. Dip one end in chocolate ganache, when kitchen and cookies are totally cool.

I used the advise of another reviewer and I added about 1/2 cup more flour to the mixture and I refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes.  I used a large scoop to put the dough on a cookie sheet, so mine didn't become flat.  However, the fork marks that I had on top we just about gone at the end of the baking process. The cookies were really good and chewy, which is what I was looking for.  I will make these again.   Thanks for the recipe!

Firstly the mixture IS MEANT TO BE SLIGHTLY RUNNY jsut before you put it onto the baking sheet! I thought perhaps more flour was needed so added an extra 2 tablespoons but I dont think this was necessary - the batch I did this to came out slightly less chewy. I baked mine for 17 minutes on 180'C and added 200g of chocolate chunks to the mixture at the same time as the flour. I also used a wooden spoon as no mixer and the cookies still came out perfect. They are really chewy and soft in the middle - when you take them out of the oven they will fall apart if you aren't careful but once cooled they are a perfect consistency and taste amazing! This recipe made 22 LARGE (ie 1 tablespoon dollop of mixture) cookies - so big I could only bake 5 at a time! So could make lots more smaller cookies. Taste just like Reeses chocolate cups yummy! Thumbs up fo this recipe, definately recommend! - My housemates and uni friends ate the whole batch within 10 minutes!!!!!

oh my goodness....
these cookies are simply AMAZING!
I have made plenty of PB cookies in the past, but these are the best by far.  The batter is very unique - sticky, but it falls off the spatula with no residue...very cool.  And the flavour is also very good....
They do take a while to bake, and they spread out on the cookie sheet, so if you are looking for very pretty cookies, space them at least an inch apart.
A MUST TRY for family and friends.  I get followed around at work by my co-workers when I walk in the door with these cookies....:)

These cookies are AMAZING, and just like what you would get at a Mrs. Fields at the mall.  They are very chewy, and I liked the flavor fine.  In addressing the negative reviews:  the size of your cookie matters!   My first batch was chewier because they were bigger.  If your cookies are too small, they will get crunchier faster, so you should check them after about 15 minutes to see.  They should be just barely brown on the edges.  Also, if you leave them on the pan for a long time after taking them out, they will continue to cook a bit, making them a little crunchier.  Do not leave them on the hot pan very long, but instead remove them onto a cool surface.  These cookies are big, chewy, thin peanut butter cookies;  not big fat cake-like cookies.

These cookies are not peanut buttery enough for me. I even added 1/4 c. extra peanut butter and they still were kind of blah. They are rather oily, too. Not horrible, but not good. I will keep searching for a good soft peanut butter cookie recipe.

I have been making these cookies for about 6 years now.  They have never failed at being delicious.  My husband is in the Navy and when he was on the submarine and would go out on deployments, I would make a massive amount of these cookies for him to take with him.  He said anytime he would be eating them, everyone around wanted some of "Mrs. Bates' peanut butter cookies."  Everyone knew about my cookies by the time his sea duty was done.  Anyways, I do add one ingredient...one bag of peanut butter chips.  They make a nice addition to an already perfect recipe.

Just what I was looking for.  Followed recipe exactly and baked for 17 minutes on parchment-lined cookie sheets. Took out of oven just as soon as they no longer looked wet on top.  Did not remove from the cookie sheets until completely cool. Perfect soft and chewy cookies that aren't overwhelmingly peanut butter-y.  A new favorite!

My children can harldy keep their hands from getting burnt on them! They ponuce on the tray as soon as I take it out of the oven. They really are good. I added extra peanut butter since we are big PB fans in this house. One thing that I did notice was that they do not bake as well on the Pampered Chef baking stones. It took far too long on the stone and they looked raw. I used the tried and true non stick cokie sheets. I know I willbe making these again soon

I love how these cookies come out, there's only ONE thing I cahnged about the recipe, I dont flatten the cookies or roll the dough into balls. I just take a clump of dough and placeit on the cookie sheet, and they come out GREAT. Everyone I make them for goes crazy about them.

The cookies taste good, and are chewy, but forget marking them with a fork, because they are flat as a pancake.  The cooking time is way off also.  My average baking time was 13 minutes.

I'm sorry, but when you need to increase the flour by 11% and decrease the egg by 33% just to make the recipe work, the recipe (as written) does NOT deserve a good rating.  I followed the recipe to a T, and this is what I found: Even after refrigerating the dough, I still ended up with super flat cookies that are closer in taste and texture to a somewhat greasy candy than a cookie.  Anything over 13 minutes at 300 degrees will result in hard, crunchy (not crispy) cookies.  If you don't mind the oiliness, though, the taste isn't bad at all.  I'll try again using everyone's flour/egg revisions, but if it turns out well, I can't give the credit to Sarah (the original submitter).

OMGosh....this is the best peanut butter cookie, I have ever had!  My family ate them up and was trying to eat the raw dough before I could get them all baked.  I did add a little more peanut butter and 1/4 cup extra flour and only used 2 eggs, but even with the additions, I couldn't have had a better cookie without the starting recipe!  Thanks a million, I will never use another recipe.

I suggest reducing the eggs to two instead of three and adding the extra 1/2 cup of flour!  These were excellent!  Thanks...

I thought these cookies were good, but they really need more flour than the recipe calls for.  After burning the first two pans, I added about 1/2 cup of flour and they turned out great!

My curiosity got the better of me after reading the other reviews and seeing such opposite results.  And I was really really hungry for a chewy-type cookie, not the traditional crumbly sort.  I followed the directions to the letter, up until I was ready to put them on the sheet. The batter was extremely soft, so I thought they would flatten too much.  I considered chilling the batter, but remember I was very very hungry!  So I gave up on exact science at that point stirred in 1 cup extra flour, dropped them on my air-bake sheet, stamped them with a wet fork (very good trick!) and baked them at 300 (hmm, lower than usual) for 18 minutes.  They are chewy and taste good. They are very light-colored for peanut butter cookies, almost anemic looking (due to the slight underbaking to get chewy centers), but again, taste good.  Not the best cookie I ever had, but fine and I'm sure they will all disappear.

These turned out awful, just awful! I didn't even get to bake them because the batter turned out too grainy and buttery. Think I'll stick to the recipe I have in my trusty cookie cookbook. Thanks anyway!

Extremely easy recipe to make. I think I came out with 3 dozen in this recipe alone so be prepared to have that oven on for a while. Thankfully, I read everyone else's reviews and took their advice. I added a 1/4 cup of flour and only used two eggs. Next time I will cut down on the sugar a bit and add more peanut butter, otherwise it's a cross between a sugar cookie and peanut butter cookie. As for baking time, 15 minutes worked perfectly for me to get that perfect bite and color. Could be because I'm in a high-altitude state, not sure. Otherwise this was simple and certainly recommended.

Well i liked the dough but i always tweek it up and never measure accurately but they are baking now i always think with any recipe after the first bake a person can always add, subtract or do whatever you like best.  My dough turned out perfect i don't like to mess with balls and refrigerator its easiest to just spoon it out.As far as taste the dough was delicious and i couldn't keep my daughter out of it! Very delicious and i forgot to mention that in any recipe i always sift the dry ingredients and used crunchy peanut butter.

This recipe was not to my liking. Followed directions, were soft and chewy when they first came out but after 5 minutes were not soft at all. You can taste more sugar than peanut butter. What a joke.

These cookies were turned out awful. I followed the instructions to the T, but still the worse cookies. The first batch  that went in the oven the batter was way to thin so I added more flour to the rest but still turned out awful.

Loved this recipe!  They are the softest and chewiest.  Not sure why others are having a problem with it...perhaps the altitude or perhaps it was because I mixed everything with a fork instead of a mixer?  Granted, when baking, they will puff up, but right before they are ready to come out they seem to flatten back into a normal cookie shape.  Everyone loved them!  I'm keeping this one for the books.  Thanks!  =)

I love the taste of these cookies. Like other reviewers, I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup more PB and about 1/2 cup more flour. That made them more fluffy instead of chewy. Maybe next time I will try the exact recipe and see how it turns out for me.

These cookies actually came out PERFECT.  I can not give it 5 stars because of the modifications I made BUT seriously, I was even suprised how great these turned out.  Our family does not use cane sugar so I substituted about 1 cup of palm sugar(jarred, sold in asian food markets) and about 1/2 cup of honey.  These came out crispy on the edges and super soft in the middle.  Also I cooked these only 16 minutes and they were perfect.  If you are looking to get away from cane sugar, palm sugar is an excellent alternative, it also comes in granulated packs!! ENJOY!

The only reason this did not get 5 stars was because I did tweek the recipe just a bit after reading the other reviews.  The changes I made were a 1/4 cup more flour and half was bread flour then a 1/4 cup more peanut butter.  These were fantastic cookies!

Fantastic cookies, but they are NOT your grandmother's peanut butter cookies! These are a drop cookie with no need for the use of a fork. I added 2 cups of salted peanuts. If you're wanting more peanut flavor, you can substitute 1 tsp of "peanut butter flavoring" (Watkins sells this) for 1 of the tsp of vanilla. Great recipe!

I would have preferred to use a different recipe.  After following the recipe exactly, the cookies came out flat and grainy versus soft and chewy.  I added approximately 1/2 cup of flour after the first batch and peanut butter chips to make up for the lack of flavor.

Delicious! I have never made PB cookies before, but wanted to try these. Made no alterations at all and they came out absolutely wonderful! Chewy, flavorful, big, perfect! I have a feeling any issues with this recipe are user error because I am no baker and they were great.  We will definitely be making these again and again!

I have to tell you i had never made homemade peanut butter cookies before. Now my family and friends wont let me stop.  In the last month I have made at the very least 60 dozen, no joke.  My best friends boyfriend is a trucker and he puts his order in everytime he comes into town.  When i have the stuff i make enuogh to make at least a dozen a day for a week.  Between my boyfriend and my kids i cant keep them in the house. I barely manage to keep them out of them for 5 min after they are out of oven.

I changed the sugar and brown sugar to Splenda and I substituted the eggs to make it allergy free for my son and even with those changes the cookies are wonderful! Soft chewy and yummy! I also shortened the time by two minutes...

These are the best peanut butter cookies ever.  I don't usually do reviews because I tend to change all of my recipes.  The only thing I did with these was added a little extra peanut butter.  I did end up having to cook them for 20-21 min instead of the 18 but they turned out perfect.  I am actually getting ready to make them for the second time in a week.  The only note I have is to make sure to do the full batch.  I only did 1/2 the first time and they were gone within 24 hours.

In my family we are huge cookies people. However, my mother when she makes cookies, they usually are nice and soft right when they come out. But, they get really hard. When I tried this recipe I was expecting the cookies to sit there for a few days. They were gone within 24 hours of making them. The most common comment was they were so soft and chewy. Everyone kept asking for more. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. :-D

These cookies were good, I would like to find a cookie that is softer though.  I will use this recipe until I find something better.

Im not sure how everyone had wet batter. i followed the recipe except i added an extra 1/4cup peanut butter and it looked just like all the other pb recipes ive used. They taste great but we will see if  they end up staying soft.

I am giving this recipe a 5 star rating because they are delicious cookies and do come out soft and chewy!  I have only made them once so far, and here are my suggestions on this recipe.  Do not leave the cookies in the oven too long.  Go with only 18 minutes or slighly less.  If you leave them in too long they become crunchy.  Add more peanut butter if you like a more peanuty buttery taste.  Or try adding some candies as mentioned in another review.  These cookies do turn out flat, so give them plenty of space to spread out on the cookie sheet.  I would not press the criss cross with the fork on the cookie, since that flattens the cookie too much.  One more thing, if you like a sweeter cookie, roll the dough balls in sugar prior to baking.  I did that to half of my batch and they were excellent that way too!  Enjoy!

These are the best peanut butter cookies!! When I make them, I chill the dough for about an hour so that I can form it into balls more easily. I also only cook them for 16 minutes- they come out perfect!

I normally don't like Peanut Butter cookies because they're so hard and dry. But these are wonderful!! Moist, chewy, and very peanut butter-y. And very easy to make. I'll never use another peanut butter cookie recipe! This is a definite keeper!

Yummy yummy cookies. I ate so much batter I didn't eat a cookie until today.  Anyways the cookies are chewy and good today.  My batter was fine, fluffy almost like icing.  I have a few old school cookie rec. from my Gram and the batter is the same texture so maybe I'm used to it.  Will def. make these again.  I added aprox 1/4 C extra PB (I think good quality PB is a must for taste - and they won't be oily)  and PB chips.  Probably didn't need the extra PB but from reviews I added it.  Def. will add the chips again though.  Thank you for a great recipe! Mine took the 22 minutes to bake and cooled partially on sheet before placing on rack - made big nice cookies!  Oh- I didnt' do the fork criss/cross and they spread while bakeing. Cheers!

These cookies were fantastic. It really helps to refrigerate the dough before baking because the dough is quite liquidy. Also, make sure to let them cool before stacking them or they meld together. They were delicious.

After reading the reviews, I decided to omit an egg, double the baking soda, and increase flour to 2 1/4 cups.  Batter turned out nice, I was able to roll balls and place to place on cookie sheets.  I added chocolate chips..it made it hard to properly criss-cross the balls, but they turned out great all the same.  A good recipe, as long as you take time to read the reviews!

i really liked this recipe! if you like the cookies chewy, this recipe is defientely for you! if you like them extra chewy i suggest you wait till the next day to eat them! put them in a jar with a small piece of bread, and they'll stay moist and soft! you can really taste the peanut butter! i'm just a teen, and these are easy to do! and it makes alot more that it says it does. i tried to make a dozen to try them out, but it came out as two dozen! maybe because mine are small, but then they spread so put them around 2-3 inches apart! i used half the amount of butter because of a measuring mistake, but it still turns out lovely and moist! i gave them to my mom and she ate the whole 2 dozen instead of dinner!

Oh my gosh! This is THE best chewy peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten. They are gorgeous, easy to make, chewy to perfection. Cook times were accurate. I added mini reeses peanut butter cups and that was the "icing on the cookie" so to speak!

Very good peanut butter cookies.  I didn't use a fork to flatten them, I patted them a little bit with my fingers and they flattened really well.  Baking time was only 10 min though.

unlike those nasty hard crispy recipes you find all to often, these were great. They turn the loveliest golden brown and no matter what kind of peanut butter you use, it will make people stand by the oven and wait until theyre done. 
This is a keeper!!!

Be carefull not to overcook them, otherwise they'll get really hard.  I prefer to take them out of the oven before they start getting golden brown.

These are delicious!  They are definately on the thin side but are soft and chewy in the middle with a slight crispness along the edges, yum yum!  I followed previous advice and used 2 eggs (instead of 3)and I used 2 1/4 cup of flour(instead of 2 cups)We added about a cup of  peanut butter chips to give it that extra peanut buttery taste.   I baked mine for about 12 minutes (they still looked and felt gooey, but I took them out anyway because I know they will still continue to cook outside the oven) I then let them cool for about 2 min. on cookie sheet before I transfered them to a wire rack.  I will definately make again, Thanks for sharing!

Wow! These are great. The only problem I had was starting them at 7:00 P.M. This recipe makes alot of cookies and with such a low temperature it took forever to get them all baked. I'll make them again and again. I'll just start them much earlier. Thanks for such a good chewy cookie!

I followed the suggestion of 2 eggs, an extra 1/4 c of flour, and insted of creamy PB I used chunky and the cookies turned out great.  I slightly underbaked them for 16-17 min.  I was so excited that the cookies were chewy the first ever recipe that I have tried where they are not super crisp.  Yummy!!

I made these cookies for my family(6)which informed they didn't like peanut butter cookies.
After tring these they all changed their minds. I cant make them fast enough. I double the recipe,some times more to freeze. they freeze well and are the moisted peanut butter cookie. Be very careful not to over bake or they will be quit crispy.

These recipes are incredible if you use your imagination. I followed the recipe exactly, and the first batch turned out to be more of peanut butter puddles than cookies...they were very flat and I don't know what the point of putting fork marks in them was b/c they were so streched you couldn't see them. I decided to add a about a 1/4 to 1/2 c. extra flour and an extra scoop of peanut butter. Turned out better, but still lacking flavor as they tasted kind of flourly. In the end, they were edible, but barely.

This is my go to recipe for these cookies I have been making them for years now and they are always delicious, also reading some of these comments make me sad.. didn't anyone teach these people if they have nothing nice to say to keep their mouths shut ? if the recipe didn't work out for you or if you think it's gross keep it to yourself. People end up looking like fools for being so rude

These are the best cookies I have ever made. Followed the recipe to a T and maybe added some more flour, but not much and viola! I am making these tonight for the second time since I am craving some and have not made any in about a year! Hopefully my friend likes them as well!! I also use this recipe and substitute it with chocolate chip cookies. If your bold and feel like getting a little crazy, add a half cup of chocolate chips to the batch!

After reading quite a few reviews lack of flavor I did tweak this ..
I added: **1/2 cup more peanut butter**1/4 cup flour** 1 tsp molasses** I also added another 1/2 tsp of salt** I baked mine for 7 MINUTES on a cookie sheet then let sit on the cookie sheet for 3 minutes out of the oven to finish baking while cooling. These were very soft and chewy and had a wonderful peanut butter flavor.. The secret is to NOT OVER BAKE. Hope this helps you.

Followed the recipe, only change i made was adding some semi-sweet chocolate chips. Used a 1 and 1/2 in. cookie scoop and got 6 dozen cookies. Other than that, these turned out great! Little on the sweet side but that is totally personal opinion. Next time I will probably cut out the 1/4c. of both sugars.

Well first time ever using recipe from the internet, must be old fashsion always used traditional cook books. This recipe was quick and easy but way to runny, had to add another 1/2 of flour to keep cookie form. As for the taste, they are very good. If you do use this recipe make sure you add more flour than what it calls for.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!! When you add the flour, add it in sections. Add some, then beat, add more then beat until it is all gone. Also each oven is different so I cooked my cookies at 14 minutes and they came out perfectly! They were not flat. I used butter Pam on my fork instead of water and barely pushed down. This made 64 wonderful medium sized cookies ?

I lowered the sugar to 1 cup each of white and brown sugar the first time I made them. They were good. I didn't think they were peanut-buttery enough though. So I made them again with 1/4 cup more PB and 1/4 almost 1/4 cup less butter. Both times I let the dough chill and had no problems with very flat cookies. But the second time I chilled it longer and they were puffier.   Also, the first batch I made I cooked to what I thought was done (20 min?) and DH thought they were over done (he's the one who likes chewy). I've cooked the following batches everywhere between 11-18 min and HE likes them best about 16 min. Barely done, but definitely chewy.   He also is hooked on sea-salt topped cookies, due to a place we've stopped before. So rather than rolling in sugar, I grind some sea-salt on top of them.

Great recipe.  I did have to alter the amount of time it takes to cook them.  I followed the advice of one of the other reviews and shortened the time to 15 min.  When I cooked them at even 18 min. they were way too dark and crunchy instead of chewy.  Otherwise, very tasty treat!

I won't make this recipe again, as the cookies were paper thin.  They are soft and chewy, just as the name implies, but they have too much sugar for my liking and I prefer cookies that have a little more substance to them!    I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of flattening them with a fork before baking them - this step is not necessary, as they flatten out all by themselves.  I easily got 6 dozen cookies, not the 3 dozen the recipes states it makes.  I will keep looking for that "perfect" chewy peanut butter cookie recipe.

I did not enjoy this recipe.  To start off with, I doubled the recipe because I was looking for more than 3 dozen cookies.  I ended up with over 130 cookies.  At 18 minutes baking time, the cookies were dark and crisp all the way through so I did modify the baking time going forward.  They have a peanut-buttery taste that is somewhat overpowered by the sweetness.  It's not the worst peanut butter cookie I've ever eaten but it is far from the best.

these cookies came out just like the title but kind of sweet...next time I will try adding more peanut butter and less white surgar...I also had to adjust my oven temp to 275 because it seemed like the bottoms were cooking too quickly but I know that every oven varies with temp...I also cooked them for 15 min instead of the min 18....overall they were wonderful and would make them again....

Better than Mrs. Fields!  I added a bit more peanut butter (about 1/8 cup), and a bag of milk chocolate chips.  Don't need to press them down, they bake fine right from the spoon.  Definitely a keeper!

These little cookies turned out picture perfect and so yummy.  My family loved them!  I added Chocolate chips as others had, but also baked part of them plain.... Both were equally good and wonderfully chewy as promised...... I will use this recipe again and again~  Thank you!  :)

I am always looking for good cookie recipes and this is one.  The only variation I made to the mixture is I added one small bag of peanut butter chips--yum.  These cookies are wonderful and would highly recommend them.  I cooked them for 20 min. a batch on a pampered chef stone and they were perfect.  A must have recipe.

The first batch of cookies I made were awful.  They were runny and bland.  In desperation, I poured the batter into a greased 9X9 pan and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and they actually made really good peanut butter brownies.  I'll make them again because this is a good basic foundation recipe.  I'll probably add chocolate chips the next time I make them.

These cookies were great!  A trick I learned from my mom when making cookies: always do 1/2 butter and 1/2 vegetable shortening.  The cookies tend to stay fluffier and end up less greasy.  I also added some chocolate chips the second time around...fabulous!!

I followed this recipe to the T, and it scared me at first because the mixture seemed a bit too thin. But after all was said & done, the cookies turned out good. Now I'm just waiting to see if the cookies are still soft tomorrow.

These cookies really are delicious.  I followed pretty closely, only changing the sugars to 1 C white and 1 1/2 C brown, just because I personally prefer the taste of brown sugar.  These are definitely soft in the center and lightly crispy on the edges.  The dough is pretty soft, even after some time in the fridge, so using a spoon is easiest (I have always rolled my PB cookies by hand in the past).  I was hoping for a little bit of a thicker cookie (these flatten out pretty well in the oven), but overall, very tasty cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were a big hit in our house.  My husband, who isn't a big sweets eater, just loved them. After I took the cookies out of the oven, I placed a hershey kiss in the center.  Excellent cookies!

These are easy cookies to make, they taste nice.  My biggest problem with the recipe was the time!  They said to bake them 18 to 20 minutes, oh my goodness!  No way!  I have never baked a cookie for that long.. so I checked it at 10 minutes and good thing I did.. A minute longer and it would have burned!  But other than I put an extra cup of peanut butter in it, and I think I might go and add peanut butter chips for more peanut butter flavor.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Thanks.. this is a much better recipe than the flour-less one!

This recipe is definetly a keeper. I made it today because I had a lot of peanut butter & nothing to do with it.My fiance said it was the best cookies he has ever ate. I didn't have any brown sugar so I used all white. I didn't have baking soda so I substituted it with baking powder. I didn't have vanilla so I left it out. I cooked 5 jumbo cooks for 17 mins and they came out great. Thanks for a great recipe.

The first time I made these cookies in a gas oven I cooked them for 18 or 19 minutes and they came out PERFECT and stayed wonderfully chewy for days (I also added extra PB per other reviewers' advice).  However, when I then cooked them in an electric oven I found that they stayed soft only while they were fresh, and the day after they were crumbly and crunchy like many other recipes I've tried.  Nevertheless, the flavor was wonderful both times; I'm guessing the differences lies in the heat from a gas vs. an electric source.  I'll definitely still use the recipe!

I loved this recipe!  It really did make a soft and chewy peanut butter cookie.  I only baked mine for 14 1/2 minutes, 18 minutes was too long. Maybe my oven runs a little warm.  You do not need to do the criss cross pattern, this cookie spreads like other cookies.  I was able to get 24, 1 oz. scoops on a baking half sheet.  They didn't touch and came out perfectly.  I am eager to try again but maybe with some mini chocolate chips, YUM!

They turned into rocks a few minutes after taking them out of the oven.  I think it might be because I used reduced fat peanut butter.  I'll try the good stuff next time.

These cookies turned out terrific. I made a few changes in that I used splenda brown AND splenda white sugar. they were plenty sweet. almost too sweet so I would cut the splenda down just a tad. I also added choc chips to them.. so yummy!

This is a vey good recipe.
I left mine on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes, then moved to wire rack.
A bit dissapointed in how thin they turned out though. I would have added 1/4c of extra peanut butter!
other than that, great recipe!!!

this recipe is great. i even had to substitute white sugar for the brown sugar (we're broke right now, and out of brown sugar). i was really concerned that they would turn out terrible w/o the brown sugar, but they turned out great! crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. they are oily, but in the best way!

I thought these were delicious!  They're different from your typical pnut butter cookies but they were good.  I only had to put mine in for 19 mins to get the perfect chewiness w/the crispy edges.  I chilled my batter which made it alot easier to deal with.  I would suggest the same to everyone else.  Am definitely keeping this in my recipe box!

I added 1/4 cup of flour as another reviewer suggested.  Mistake. Not chewy at all. Pressed PB M&Ms into top.  Nice.  Will try again w/o extra flour.

EXCELLENT COOKIES!! I followed the recipe but i mixed the dough the night before a party. I used a melon scoop to drop the cookies and baked for 22 min. they do not look fully cooked at first --but they are-- let them sit for 2 min to cool. They turned out wonderful and were soooo chewy.

After reading the reviews, it must be said that I went into this with a bit of trepidation. I took the advice of several posters and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, omitted the egg, and for my own contribution, 1/4 cup less sugar. (equal mix of white and brown). I followed the rest of the recipe to a T. After they came out,  I had everyone try one out. It was nice, crumbly, and a bit crunchy. That was the first one with twelve minutes cooking time. The next batch, I went with eleven minutes cooking time. Still a bit too brown around the edges. So I went lower with ten minutes. Still brown. Finally, I went down to nine minutes on the fourth tray and they  turned out almost perfect. They were soft, chewy, and peanut buttery. However, the problem was that they were now too oily. There was something about it I couldn't wrap my head around... It was good, it really was, but it wasn't as good as I was first expecting. But  it was extremely lush in terms of how  fast my friends devoured them. I'm a finicky peanut butter cookie gal, so I think it's more of a personal issue than that the cookies were no good! I'd bake them again, but I'll probably try out a few other recipes that'll satisfy me.

I made them just as the recipe called for.. I also should have read the reviews first.  The texture was like cool whip.. way too soft and runny to hold any kind of shape whatsoever.  The taste of the batter was overly sweet..

These cookies are amazing.  My Mom has always made the best peanut butter cookies, and noone has ever been able to top her until now!  It took 26 years, but it's finally happened.  Definitely recommend to all peanut butter cookie lovers!

I decided to try this recipe because of the higher rating...then I read most of the reviews and got scared!  But, the cookies came out quite good.  The only alterations I made to the recipe were an additional cup of flour, and only baking the cookies for 15 minutes.  They came out chewy, and tasty - with a great texture.

My man loved these cookies...They were good....but they spread a little too thin for my liking, but still good.  We liked that the PB taste came through, but it wasnt overly sweet.  A GREAT addition to half of the batter was a handful of milk choc. chips.....the tastes went together great!  The only thing i didnt like is that about 2 days later....They got very brittle....and fell apart..but what can you expect 2-3 days later....So it wasnt that big of a deal.  But they stayed soft for a good 1.5-2 days after baking..good cookie! ADDITION TO REVIEW**** Looks at some reviews again and whoever says this recipe wont work b/c of 3 eggs and only 2 c. flour is wrong.  They do spread a little, but they stay moist and chewy and awesome for DAYS!!!  So obviously, if you want hard, crackly cookies, these arent for you!! Hubby says they are the best PB cookies ever..and hes picky.

Great recipe, mine came out soft and chewy the first time around and it was very easy to make.  Great peanut butter flavor and not too sweet.  You should try to make a small batch for your first time - that's what I did.  Thanks Sarah.

AWESOME! I've been trying to find a chewy peanut butter cookie recipe for awhile and this is it!! I read the reveiws first so I added more peanut butter(1 1/4 cup). After a few trays I added peanut butter chips to the batter and they still came out great!! My family liked them both but the ones with the chips were gone first! (Although the whole batch was gone in only 2 days!!! They DO get flat( I didn't flatten with a fork) but overall I'd say this ones DEFINITLY a keeper!!

these were the worst cookies i have ever had. i love peant butter cookies and every time i make them they end up at a party and are gone in seconds, good thing these didnt go to one. you really got to watch them in the oven 'cause they go from fluffy to flat in 2 seconds. these cookies didnt even taste good and gave a couple of us hart burn. sorry but these were not good at all!

The cooking time was way off and the flavour was kind of off. The recipe made a way too much. Even with giant cookies (4-5 inch across) it still made 20 cookies. They were extremely flat and got very very hard. I made them a week ago and they're still sitting there. Wouldn't make them again.

With minor changes to the ingrediant amounts, these are wonderful, easy to make cookies.  They have terrific texture - chewy with just a little bit of crisp around the edges.  Be sure to watch your timing - I did the first batch at 15 and it was a little too long for my oven - 13 minutes worked perfectly.  Plus, I did add 1/4 flour & just 2 eggs as the other reviewer recommended.  I did not cut the sugar back because we use natural PB (no sugar added).  I can see that if you use typical store PB you would want to cut back or it would be too sweet.  I added a little extra "scoop" of PB (no more than 1/4 cup).  I don't know if it was really necessary, but I had just that much left in the jar.  Great PB taste - very pure!

This recipe was really good, like others said, do not change the recipe at all, and they will come out. The only thing that I can suggest to the bakers that the recipe didn't work for, is... if you overbeat the butter, your cookies will turn out flat. Guaranteed! Also, use 'regular peanut butter', i.e., Skippy, Jif, etc. NOT the healthy/natural stuff. Not enough hydrogenated oils in it to hold the peanut butter together (Sad as it sounds! LOL!) The natural pb might make the dough too wet. Also, you have to cool the cookie on the sheet for about 2 minutes BEFORE you take them off. If you go too long, the cookies are going to stick to the pan, (For the reader that said that they were all stuck). 
But for the taste, they were great! I dipped my fork in granulated sugar and then made the criscross marks on the cookies. The indentations were fine. I also rolled the teaspoonfulls of cookie dough into balls to make them uniform shaped in roundness. 
Will keep this recipe. I also stored them in a ziplock and had one today. They got a bit crisp, but still chewy on the inside. I am still on the hunt for less chewy, but more soft if that makes sense. :)

Great cookies, nice peanut flavor I did make the changes suggested the 2 eggs and the 1/2 cup of flour they came out soft and chewy this will be my standard recipe for peanut butter cookies. Next time I'm going to add m&ms and choc. chips.

OMG! These are the best peanut butter cookies ever! Made them twice and they have come out perfect each time...and I don't cook!  Try them you will not be disappointed...even if this is your first time baking cookies...failure is not possible! Regardless of the bad reviews this recipie got.....people who gave them either changed the recipe,cooked them to long, or made the spoonfuls to big or little. DONT CHANGE ANYTHIING!!
Thanks again Sarah. This will be in the family for many years to come :)

WOW! These are excellent! I followed the reviewers' suggestions and added 1/2 cup of flour and took away an egg. I also took away 1/4 cup of brown sugar to lessen the sweetness, and used chunky instead of creamy peanut butter. These were awesome cookies. Sweet, but not too sweet, and soft and chewy, just the way I like it. Will DEFINETELY make again.

Had I initially read the reviews, I would have known to add more flour and one
less egg.  I did not, however, and these cookies turned out horribly for me. 
Perhaps it was the light pbutter I tried to use.  Anyway, they sounded good, but 
unfortunately were a tremendous flop for me.

Sarah, these cookies are the best!!!  I couldn't stop eating them.  I found the dough was a little too moist, so I added a little more flour just until the dough didn't stick to my hands.  I also added some peanut butter chips. These cookies were everything I was hoping for.  Soft, chewy and moist.  This will become the only peanut butter cookie recipe I'll ever use...except for when my mom visits.  She enjoys the crisp kind.

I've made this recipe four times now, my coworkers and family love them! I followed the ingredients exactly. The only steps differently I do is putting the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes then I roll the dough into balls and roll the balls in sugar before placing on cookie sheet. I dont flatten them with a fork, because the cookie does spread when baking. I put the dough back in the refrigerator/freezer between each batch, so the dough stays firm. They turn out perfect!

They are good soft cookies but this is the second time for making them so this time I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter which made them more peanutbutter tasty.  I also folded in chocolate chips at the end which made for a better tasty cookie. A true thumbs up and a must try recipe.

This recipe is very easy and makes a good amount of cookies! These cookies are soft, chewy, and so very tasty. Grab some milk and enjoy them warm fresh out of the oven! My husband and my kids love this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!

Very tasty! Don't let the bad reviews scare you off. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and used a mini ice cream scoop to form the balls of dough. Go heavy of rolling them in a bowl of granulated sugar before you swish them with a sugared fork and use parchment paper on your cookie sheet. You're good to go!

I’m not sure about the bad reviews for this peanut butter cookie recipe. I did do a bit of tweaking, but for the most part this recipe is good. My husband is a die-hard peanut butter fan and I don’t even particularly like it...but, we both agree that the cookies I made from this recipe were a favorite. I used 1 c. LIGHT brown sugar and 1/4 c. DARK brown sugar. Also, I used HONEY pb and added in an additional approx. 1/8 c. CRUNCHY pb. Lastly, I added an entire bag...yes, the whole bag...of chocolate and peanut butter chips to the dough. We cooked them exactly 18 minutes at 300* and they were perfectly chewy with a slight crisp on the edges. So tasty.

my husband loved these cookies. I added m&M's to half the batch and raisins to the other half. the peanut butter taste was very mild and the cookies flattened . I suggest adding more flour and peanut butter .

I made recipe as is with the exemption of baking at 375 for 10 minutes and I refrigerated for about 30 minutes before scooping out the balls. The texture is perfect! They are chewy and soft, EXACTLY as described and exactly as I wanted them to be. My only complaint was that I would have liked a little more peanut butter taste so next time I’ll either add peanut butter chips as others suggested or a little more peanut butter. Thank you for the recipe it’s a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly what I got was more like brownie mix consistency could not shape into a ball just spooned into pan.
Put the rest in the fridge to chill see if it helps I hate to waste so well see. I will update once I do the rest.fingers crossed.......

Somewhat tasteless and not really ‘chewy’. I had to add another 1/2C of flour to make a decent batter and added 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  I refrigerated the dough for over an hour and they still spread out way too much on the baking sheet.  Wouldn’t make again

These cookies were wonderful and tasty. The only thing I did different was I used Omega 3 peanut butter and I would make them again and again.  I am defiantly going to share this recipe.  I gave my friend some of them and she thought that they tasted yummy!  
And I must say people please try this recipe it is delicious.  And they are yummy especially with coffee or a big glass of milk.

I literally just signed up to this site just so I could rate this delicious recipe! Soooo good. The cookie dough was a mousse like texture- totally different from what I'm used to or expected. Don't forget to wet the fork! I feel like they came out even better after refrigerating overnight...and I was able to roll the dough rather than use my ice cream scoop. I was pretty hefty with the flour and the amount of peanut butter simply because of my healthy addiction to homemade pb cookies- lol other than that wouldn't change a thing! Thank you so much for sharing!! Best. Dessert. Ever.

Wow! Exactly what I was looking for! Listened to the reviews and added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/4 cup more peanut butter and only baked for 20 minutes and turned out PERFECTION! Absolutely will make again and again!

Added another 1 an 1/4 cup flour, rolled into balls and rolled in sugar.  Pressed with a fork....even added a few M&M's on a couple to please my 7 y.o. daughter who was helping me. :)

Dough seemed WAY to wet following the recipe as originally described.  Came out great with the additional flour.

I made these as recipe said except did not refrigerate.  We all loved them.  I will be making them again and again.  I did not read reviews prior to making them; and would add more peanut butter next time as we are all peanut butter crazy.  Certainly delicious as it is.  Perfect.

I just made these today and due to the batter, they don't make a standard looking PB cookie. but I was pleasantly surprised on the flavor and texture. They had the feel of eating a sugar cookie. I didn't think it was a bad recipe but I think the old fashioned is better. Happy I still tried it.

I am not a baker, but neededicated something for Christmas party. Food this recipe. It was easy and made lots. I didn't know how much of  a raw drop I should use and ended up with cookies that smushed into each other. Cut white sugar down to 1 cup and added dark chocolate chips. It takes more of a chocolate chip cookie. The ones without chocolate chip had faint peanut butter taste. I liked them that way, not overpowering. I would make again.

This recipe is straight out of the Mrs. Fields Cookie Book.  They are my favorite peanut butter cookie.  I'm happy to find this so that I can mark it and put it into my favorites.  I have been making these since 1992 when I got the cookbook.  Now it is on Allrecipes, I have the recipe wherever I go.

Flavor is spot on but these cookies are a nightmare.  Flat oily mess! Way to much egg to flour ratio. After the first batch I ended up having to dr. The rest of the dough to try and save them I added about 1/4 c flour and about a 1/2 t baking powder. Even after cooling you cannot hardly hold one to eat without basically folding in half.  "Soft and chewy" actually means runny and flat... thumbs down.

These were too sweet and not nearly peanut buttery enough and we had to cook them 6 minutes over the stated time and upped the temp as well. I can't understand how anyone can give a recipe a good rating and then say they changed it! It's misleading. And I don't want to spend all my time  reading reviews to find out what tweaks should be made to make it good. Don't think I'll be using this site any more.

Out of the oven, these cookies were not soft or chewy.  After cooling and placing in a plastic, ziptop bag, they did soften up and were tasty.

If I could give more stars I would! Absolutely to die for! My husbands exact words were "those cookies...the bomb!!" I made them exactly as written just baked them for less time (13 minutes)  I took some to work and they are asking for more! The only thing that bummed me out was that they weren't chewy. No biggie though I just put them in the microwave for 15 seconds before eating. Chewy and delicious!!!!

Super easy to make and very yummy. Made it exactly as the recipe is written. I used my Ninja blender with the dough setup and mixed all the ingredients thoroughly. They expand a whole lot about 3x the size from raw. Even though they expanded and flattened out they are soft and delicious. I will definitely make it again!

Recipe is perfect, except for one detail. The baking time is way, way,  WAY off. If you bake these for 18-22 mins, you will end up with peanut-flavored coasters. 

I baked them for 15 mins, and they still turned out too crunchy. My advice? Bake them no more than 12-13 mins if you want chewy cookies.

This was a good recipe but comes to soft so I added another cup of flour and I used Flieshmann's butter in the tub, they came out great so light and fluffy. Not heavy

I have not tried this recipe yet, but just noticed that this is the same exact recipe on food.com with the title "Mrs. Fields Soft And Chewy Peanut Butter Cookies. Not sure who gets the credit for this recipe.

These are perfect just the way they are. I didn't make ANY changes like many did. I also don't understand how so many people managed to mess up this recipe as it's quite simple! My baby and boyfriend love these cookies and I'm so confident in this recipe I'm sending a batch over to the neighbors kids for doing a good deed. These cookies are great!

I think this is a great recipe. It is heavy on  butter and eggs making the batter  fluffier and more melty (a little like a spritz cookie), but they are so very tasty. As thin as they become, they are great and satisfying as they spread out and also great for PB sammie cookies and PB ice cream sammies.  

I can see this cookie as a good base for a chocolate ganache drizzle as well or may mixing toffee into the batter. 

If you have to have the thicker more typical "old fashioned" pb cookie, you may have a little trouble with it. But, I love it.

These cookies are really good. The texture is nice and chewy.  But the peanut butter flavor is a bit on the mild side, like other reviewers have suggested.  I will definitely make these again but will likely add peanut butter chips to them.  The only thing I changed about the recipe is reducing the amounts of each sugar by 1/4 cup.  Didn't even miss it.  Yummy.

Honestly, it is a good recipe. I saw a lot a reviews that they added an extra 1/4 cup, so I went ahead and did that. My cookies still ended up flattening too much anyway. (Think it was because I was using self-rising but what ever.) My tip is to not mash the cookie down and only cook it for 10 minutes. I let the first batch sit in the oven for barely 15 and their edges got burnt. The inside of the cookie was amazing and gooey though. After that I just left in for 10 minutes and they came out perfect. 
To recap: Add extra flour,  don't mash the cookie, and only cook it for 10 minutes. All in all, its a really good recipe.

I set the timer for 18 min (18-22 recommended on recipe), and at 14 min they were thin, dark brown & in my opinion, over-baked. They are crisp.  I would not recommend this recipe.

The first batch flattened like pancakes, so I added about 1/4 cup more flour, and spooned out the second batch smaller. These are more like sugar cookies with a bit of peanut butter, and mine came out more crispy than chewy, but that was probably because of the convection oven. They're good, but I think I'll add more peanut butter next time.

Made these cookies and they turned out perfectly.  I usually don't like pb cookies because they are hard and they crumble.  These were soft and chewy.  Soooooo good.

Dough too wet when finished mixing? Keep in mind that different brands of peanut butter contain varying amounts of oil, which will definitely change the consistency of your dough. 

I follow another users advice with 1/4 cup more flour and an extra peanut butter (a good, thicker one). They come out great every time.

I did not have enough to make the 18 serving recipe so I cut the recipe  in half but added additional 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup peanut butter, and only 1 egg.  I rolled them into small balls and cooked in a toaster oven middle rack, crisscross patterned, at 350 degrees.  About 6 minutes they were done.  Delicious!

Makes lovely soft biscuits. Afte making this reciepe about 10 times, i decided to try some changes and I settled on only using  3/4 cup of each sugar and i added 1/2 cup of peanuts. My lack of 5 stars is because these biscuits are not what i would call 'chewy'... Soft, definately, but not chewy. I still havent found one that meets my chewy needs, so if anyone knows, please suggest one ;-)

I've been using this recipe since 2009 and will never use another.  I have always followed the recipe exactly, only sometimes adding chocolate chips.  Everyone loves these cookies.  They are wonderful.  For those who have had issues, I've discovered that using margarine will sometimes make them come out flatter than a pancake.  I only use butter at home, but when I made these at work, all they had was margarine.  That was the only change to the recipe, so I'm blaming the margarine.  :)

Perfect peanut butter cookies!!
Tried this recipe last night and they were soooo delicious. I won't use any other recipe for peanut butter cookies. If you follow the recipe closely, they come out just fine. The dough was unusually "fluffy" for cookie dough but it didn't matter...once baked (took the full 22 minutes), they were perfectly soft and chewy. 
To the nay sayers, give it another go...following the recipe this time...you'll be glad you did! 
Wish I could give them 10 stars!
PS Even better the next day! They'll be gone by tonight!

I changed enough in this recipe that I would say it's a different recipe but he was a great base to start I only change things because I didn't have the right ingredients so to start I don't like white sugar and I didn't have any brown sugar so I used honey 3/4c honey plus 1/4 c brown sugar then added additional 1/4 flour and some vanilla plus 3/4 c regular peanut butter this recipe yielded 3 doz cookies

I did not care for this recipe. The cookies have very little peanut butter taste, they taste more like  crunchy brown sugar cookies with a very small hint of peanut butter.

Chewy and incredible flavor.
I had some doubt when I plopped these on the cookie sheet because they were so smooth. Then I was unsure the cookies were done cooking at the 22 minute mark and I took them out anyway. They turned out beautifully chewy and flavorful. The kids (in their twenties) devoured the first batch in minutes. I had one and it was enough. So satisfying.

First of all 18 minutes was way too long. At 16 minutes I smelled them so went to check and two of my four sheets were burnt.

I tried this recipe and they just ran all over my baking sheets. I took and put the melted half cooked dough back in the bowl, added 2 cups flour and then cooked a single cookie by its self to  make sure it was enough and it was.  they still were flat but they held together and still tasted good. i think i will stick to my mothers recipe from now on though!

Not soft and chewy. Hard as hockey pucks once they cool down. I baked them about 12 minutes and then they weren't too bad. Why do you advertise these as soft and chewy when not one person could bake them the way the recipe states. I love allrecipes, but you blew it this time!!

Best recipe!  I did add approx 1/3c more of flour because the dough was very wet.  I also added 2 cups of PB chips too.  They turned out great, very chewy!  I will definately use this again!

Not as chewy as I had hoped, but I made the recipe as is, just stuck a kiss on top and everyone in the house loved them. They take a leap of faith and a bit of patience, but are well worth it.

I made these and followed the recipe exactly. I chilled the dough for about an hour so it wouldn't stick to my hands. I just rolled the dough and didn't press down with a fork and they didn't come out as flat as what's shown in the pic. I also cooked for exactly 18 mins and they are still soft today. I made them 2 days ago.

These are more like Peanut Butter Pancakes. They tasted okay, were very light and fluffy, but flattened out to the point that I basically ended up with a tray of one thin cookie.

a bit different but a success all the same! It made three large trays and 2 of them came out brilliantly and then the 1 tray came out like one gian pancake. Certainly not the most attractive looking cookies ever but very nice. Next time will make them much smaller though. Could easily make up to 6 trays.

I gotta say, I am pretty disappointed by this recipe.  I knew something wasn't quite right after I mixed all the ingredients and the dough was more like cake batter.  When I baked the first batch of cookies they turned out very thin and didn't have too much of a peanut butter taste.  I added more flour and peanut butter to the dough for the second batch, but the cookies were still not to my liking.  On to the next recipe!

More sugar than flour! I noticed this AFTER I made these, I have a feeling this is why they ended up flat, like everyone else said, I think I even added more flour. I think with more modifications, they might turn out better. They didn't taste to bland to me, but they weren't the most flavorful.

A decent recipe overall. I've made them twice, the first time I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out ok. The batter was really runny though and the final product wasn't very pretty, but it tasted ok. The second time I altered the recipe a bit. I added 1/2 cup of nutella, another 1/2 flour, 3/4 chocolate chips which stiffened the batter considerably. This batch was way better than the first!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. After all the rave reviews, I was very excited to make them. When I baked them, they were very flat and the melted butter came out and  ran off the cookie sheet. I think the recipe is off-way too much butter and sugar! I added flour and they formed better but they were still too sweet. I won't make them again.

This is the second time I've made these cookies. My boyfriend just loves them. I personally think they could stand to add more peanut butter but my boyfriend doesn't want me to alter the recipe he says it's perfect the way it is. This is the recipe im going to be using to make peanut butter cookies from now on. They are soft and chewy just like the title says

Really good but did need to add more flour....probably enough to equal the amount of sugar I used (maybe shouldn't have packed the brown sugar so tight:).  First batch was flat until I added flour but they all tasted yummy and everyone loved them!

i think this is a good recipe to build personal tastes off. i dont know about other people but i can deffo say there was enough peanut butter in it (we had like 5 open containers of it so i tried to use up as much of it as i could) i was a little bit tempted to put a tad more flour in it but i didnt. i also had to substitute for a couple of eggs (to sub. 1 egg use 2tsps water, 1 tsps oil and 2 tsp baking powder) i probably should have made a couple of batches of them and kept them small cause they sort of morphed together but overall i think they arent too bad. thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are wonderful! I added a bit more peanut butter (Adams 100% natural crunchy). Otherwise, I followed the recipe and in 18 minutes, had cookies that were crunchy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside.

This recipe was way too sweet.  I could feel the grains of sugar crunching while I chewed.  Not to mention they melted into each other. I wasted my whole morning and a LOT of ingredients on this recipe. Will keep looking.

My cookies didn't turn out chewy, but they did look and taste great! As another reader suggested, I added chocolate chunks and chocolate chips. Also, I used only 3/4 cup of butter, and 1/4 cup of shortening, because I was worried they'd flatten out more than I wanted them to. I served them warm to my fellow classmates on the day of our final, and they loved them. They even beat out the Krispy Kreme donuts another person brought. :)

Great recipe!!! The cookies come out soft, chewy, and very lite!!! Just a side note, 18 minutes was the perfect cooking time in my electric oven.

This is the best peanut butter cookie I've had, and my husband, who doesn't like peanut butter cookies, actually likes these.  I think they're usually too crumbly, so the chewiness of these really helps.  I do have to say that as I am concerned with nutrition and want my kids to be able to eat these, I made some changes:  replace white flour with freshly-ground (and finely ground) whole wheat flour (usually I use Summer's Sprouted flours), replace the brown and white sugar (2.5 c total) with 1.5 c of Rapadura, and then because there's less sugar to add structure, I reduce the number of eggs from 3 to 2 (always pastured, free-range, as organic as possible eggs, of course).  Since my butter is also raw from pastured cows, I have guilt-free cookies that are DELICIOUS!  I roll the dough up in parchment paper, store in the fridge, and then slice off 1/4 to 1/2" thick rounds and bake them for 20 to 22 minutes (depending on how big around they are).

If you like peanut butter I wouldn't make these unless you're giving them away. I upped the flour by 1/4c and the PB by 1/4c also. The texture seems too soft when you go to bake them but they turn out soft and kind of on the thin side once they bake up. I like peanut butter a little too much so I kept one cookie to try and gave the rest away so I wouldn't eat them all.

These are awesome! Soft and chewy just like the the recipe says! I did follow some of the other reviews though and added extra peanut butter. I think I added an extra 1/2 cup. Next time I will add a little more flour too! They sure didn't last long! My kids were eating them as fast as they were coming out of the oven! Great cookies! Can't wait to make them again!!!!!

I was looking for a chewy peanut butter cookie and this was the perfect recipe. I had to substitute crisco for the butter but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. The cookie has a light peanut butter taste and so if you like it stronger (similar to regular Jiffy cookies) I would add a little more. It all depends on personal preference but either way, it is a wonderful cookie recipe! I will definitely keep this one and use it for years to come!

Oh my goodness! These are definitely yummy and chewy. I would suggest letting them rest for 1 minute on cookie sheet before removing. Mine were so soft that I sort of squished the edges of the first few by removing them too soon. Excellent recipe!

I liked this recipe, I did not make any adjustments, and it made soft and chewy cookies as promised. The portion it produced was a bit large for just my boyfriend and I; it wouldn't be terribly difficult to half though (with exception of the egg ). Chocolate chips would have been nice but there is already a good bit of fat and sugar already there.

I love this recipe and I followed the recipe to a T but added a cup of small chocolate chips. I recommend that after making the batter that you refridgerate over night as it will be less flat and more attractive the next day. The large amount of brown and white sugar adds a nice toffee like flavour. I did however cook a dozen cookies after making the batch, quite delicious but very flat, as these cookies make about 4 1/2 dozen cookies I refridgerated and made a dozen more the next day. Less flat! You have to know your oven and watch these closely, if you do that then there is no reason that these things shouldnt come out chewy! My husband and his family who are asians do not like sweet food so much but 2 dozen were finished fast (4 hrs tops) and I had only 2 cookies! Im selling these!

I don't consider myself anywhere near a PB cookie connoissuer, but this recipe was fabulous -- I liked the softness (14 mins on an airbake sheet at 300, still looked a little undercooked but texture was perfect) and the peanut butter flavor was perfect for me (plus threw in a cup of milk chocolate chips).  I did make the changes mentioned in the first reviews I read: since I halved the recipe, I just added 1/4 cup PB and 1 heaping T of flour, used just 1 egg, plus I chose not to read through the recipe thoroughly ahead of time, and accidentally mixed in the white sugar in with the flour bowl.  Not recommended, but not a problem!  Will definitely use recipe again.

I just tried out this recipe yesterday and was really impressed. After reading some of the reviews, the only change I decided to make was to add an additional 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I didn't want to re-create the recipe before I gave it a chance "as is". The dough is very light a fluffy, not your typical cookie dough, but the cookies turned out crispy on the edges and moist and chewy in the center. I used a large cookie scoop and still wound up with about twice as many as the recipe states and I also baked them at 350 degrees for about 11 1/2 minutes. I know my oven pretty well and I always have to adjust the temperature and time. I just bake only one cookie at a time until I get the right adjustments for my oven. I would definitely recomment this recipe; it's great!

Too sweet. These cookies were neither soft nor tasty. I had a feeling that 2 1/2 cups of sugar (combined) would be too much, and my fears came true in a cookie that claims only a one-dimensional flavor. Yuck.

This recipe was good but again the cookies were too flat for my liking. I switched the 18 servings to 24 and didn't have problems with my batter being  too runny. If I try this one again I'll go with half crunchy and half creamy P.B. :)

If you are a beginner, this recipe isn't for you.  The recipe is good if you know how to play Doctor...add additional flour, or 1 less egg.  The recipe ingredients are just not right.  You would definitely have to add flour or your cookie batter is almost soupy.  If you know how to add, then it's a good recipe.  there has to be a  better recipe around for a fabulous PB cookie!

It may be the way i mixed these, but they seem to get harder faster, the rest of my family really enjoyed them though. but sad enough to say i have had better...but then again everyones cooking techniques are not the same...but i guess over all they are okay.

These turned out pretty well...nice and chewy.  I did have to add  more flour than the 2 cups.  I also added a bag of the Nestle milk chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips to it.  These were a big hit...

I enjoyed these cookies.  I used 1 tsp of baking powder instead of the soda because I didn't have any.  And I used only one cup of white and brown sugar because I don't like super sweet cookies.  But all in all I thought this was a good recipe.  The cookies hold their shape, taste good and have a nice texture.  Just remember to let the cookies cool for a few minutes before transfering to a cookie rack.  good recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I didnt read the reviews first, and i know now to always do that first.  These cookies were not chewy, they came out crunchy and flat, almost looking like a pancake.  If you are willing to experiment with the recipe they may be good, but i wouldnt recommend them.

I am not one for peanut butter cookies at all, but i have a ton of peanut butter jars in my home, due to to little girls, and was looking for a way to get rid of some. i love chewy cookies and this one is by far the best chewy peanut butter cookie ever!..i didn't have brown suger so i used some molasses with white suger, i was nervous but they were great. i will make these again and often!!!

I made these cookies for a promotion gift for a coworker (who had given up chocolate for lent).  The taste is great...crispier on outside, gooey insides!  My cookies became huge though!  very thin and very big!  But very good too, so maybe not the prettiest cookies, but very good tasting ones!

These have a great texture, crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. The peanut butter flavour is a bit weak. Maybe a stronger paenut butter or a little more of it next time.

I made these for my husbands office and they all LOVED them and have asked for them again (I made them last week!) I did as others have and added about 2T more peanut butter and 1/4 cup more flour, this made them "stand up" better but they turned out more firm than moist. I even cut the baking in half and still came out with a perfect cookie! I used all the same ingredients but used the best quality I could find of all of them (devonshire butter, vanilla paste instead of extract, natural peanut butter ect..)can't believe how wonderful these are! This will be my standard peanut butter cookie! Yay for Sarah!

I tryed to make peanut butter cookies the night before I tryed these and those were not nearly as tasty as these cookies are. I think using butter instead of shortning makes a huge difference. I think this recipe is worth trying. There are so many peanut butter cookie recipies to choose from and this one is a keeper.

Sorry!  This one didn't fly with me.  They turned out flat, not chewy but crisp, and I couldn't even see the fork crisscross pattern after baking.  I am looking for a soft chewy peanut butter cookie recipe that holds its shape while baking.  The flavor was good, though.  My kids did like that.  I'll keep searching.  Thanks anyway.

THESE ARE SO GOOD AND EASY. I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH BROWN SUGAR SO I JUST ADDED SOME MOLASSES TO REGULAR WHITE SUGAR. THEY TURNED OUT FANTASTIC. MY TWO YEAR OLD WAS HELPING ME WITH THEM AND I JUST HOPE WE WON'T EAT ALL OF THEM BEFORE HUSBAND GETS HOME.

This recipe is the best! The pb cookies came out perfect, they were soft and chewy just like the recipe says. They tasted great and EVERYBODY liked them. I'm getting hounded now, everyone always wants me to make them! I did however use less egg as the others suggested and I tried to place the dough kind of tall before I put them in the oven(like little mountains) because I noticed that it helps so that the sides of the cookie dont overbake. They turned out great!

I followed the recipe exactly (except using crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy), and these turned out fabulously!  They were thin, but so soft and chewy, just as promised.  My kind of cookie!  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  FYI:  The dough is really light, really soft, and different from usual PB cookie dough, so if your dough is like that, nothing is wrong with it!  Thanks for a great recipe - I can't stop eating them!

these are not your typical peanut butter cookies. the texture etc is more like chewy ginger cookies and not soft and fluffy like i would want from a peanut butter cookie.  they were very sweet, not very peanut buttery and mine turned out flat..someone said that happens if you overbeat the butter. i followed the recipe exactly.
not at all my favorite.  i am looking for a peanut butter cookie more like the ones you can get at 'cookies by george' (canada).

This was such an awesome recipe, I was bored one day and I just felt like something simple yet delicious to make! They turned out great. The recipe also has a lot of flexability in it. I didn't have creamy peanut, just chunky but it still turned out great! I will be using this recipe again soon!

Preparation was really easy, ingredients were ones that you could find laying around the house.  Very fast and easy preparation. The baking time was fine but the cookies turn out better if you take them out one minute early..17 minutes.  The cookies themselves were really tastey and appealing.  We would suggest adding more sugar and a pinch of cinnamon to spice them up a little bit!  All in all a very satisfying recipe.

These cookies were great! Not to sweet and still had a great peanut butter taste. I did add a 1/2 cup flour and used only 2 eggs as recommended in the other reviews. I also used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy and they were terrific!!

Peanut butter cookies are my husband's favorite and he has decided that this should be our family's recipe.  That's how much he liked them.  I baked one batch on an air filled sheet which turned out chewy and another on a thin black sheet which turned out crispy.  Both were great!

I found these cookies to lack the sandy texture that I expect from peanut butter cookies, and to be somewhat overly sweet.

This Recipe.. is absolutely the most wonderful I have had. My first time making pb cookies and they could not have turned out more perfect! The only thing is taste the wet mix. only add sugar to taste, add 2 more heaping tbspns of pb and once everything is mixed into dough, add more flour to make it firmer! Also added choco chips. Husband luvs these!

These cookies were easy and quick to make.  The taste was very good and unlike any pb cookie I have ever made they were soft.   I did not change the recipe at all, so my cookies were a bit crisp around the edges, very good though.  I felt they could have been a little more peanut-buttery also.  Thanks for this recipe-its a keeper.

My family really enjoyed these cookies!  I made just one substitution, used margarine instead of butter, and they turned out really tasty. I didn't make any other changes to the recipe. The dough was quite soft, I only bothered making the "criss-cross" with the fork for the first sheet of cookies.  The cookies flattened out so the indentations of the fork disappeared completely!  But the cookies were very soft and chewy, just the way we like them.  Thanks!

I followed other people's suggestion of using an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 2 eggs and they turned out fabulous!  I thought they'd be the type that held their shape (that's what I was looking for) but they ended up spreading to about double their size!  At first I was dissapointed, but the taste made up for it!  I made some with jam in the center and they were even better!

I should have read other reviews before making them. It wasnt so bad, they were chewy, but there wasnt a point for making the lines on the cookies, it didnt show. I'm going to try the 2 eggs and add more flour. thanks

These cookies were exactly as they said soft and chewey.  I took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup of flour and only used 2 eggs.  I did have to cook mine the whole 18-22 minutes though.  They actually could have cooked just a tad bit longer.  I did use margarine instead of butter.  These cookies were good but I actually prefer a crunchier cookie.  Although these were good, I will be looking for a recipe for a crunchier cookie though.  Soft cookies don't dunk well in milk. lol

This was a great recipe.  I followed the previous advices about doing only two eggs and adding a little extra flour.  However, I found that the two do not make a good combination.  It was very dry and crumbly, so I add maybe two tablespoons of warm water to solve the problem.
I live in a dorm, so I do not have the luxury of owning a mixer.  I melted the peanut butter with the butter and vanilla in order to make it more manageable.  Also, being in the dorm, I found that I only had a quarter cup and some shortening.
So I guess I am trying to say, this recipe is very flexible!  
They are wonderful, and they attracted students across my whole floor to try out these cookies!!

These cookies Are really excellent and easy to make.  However I used 2 eggs instead of the suggested 3.  I also only cooked them 12 minutes.  Cooking them the recomended 18 - 22 would not do this recipe justice.  Nobody likes burnt cookies.  I also added some chocolate chips.. Yummy yummy

I tried this recipe and found it to be the easiest peanut butter cookie I've ever made. They were good and tastey. However I did read reviews before making this one and took the advice of adding two eggs and instead of adding the whole 1/4 cup flour, I added a 1/2 of a 1/4 cup. To get my cookies to press with a fork I wet the spoon every time I went to press a cookie down. Worked great.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used them in my Christmas cookie packages.  They were a hit with everyone, especially me!  I kept some back for my family.  They freeze well for later use.  Will definately make these again throughout the year. C.Ferris in China

Okay, I slaughtered this recipe and it still turned out.  I read the reviews and added the 1/4 flour and only two eggs.  I, however, was not prepared and used the only flour I had, cake and pastry self-rising which had the baking powder in it.  I added the soda called for in the recipe to that flour mix.  I also only had one cup of white sugar so used, acutally, three different brown sugars to make enough -- LOL:o) -- I don't know why, but this recipe made like five dozen cookies for me.  I cooked some that night and the rest I stuck in the fridge.  I think the ones out of the fridge came out better and I know for a fact with mine I needed the FULL 22 minutes of baking time.  They never did get brown on the bottom but were nice and toasty.
These are the most peanut-buttery cookies I've ever made.
Thanks for sharing the recipe, Julie

I'm glad I read all of the hints from previous reviews.  My cookies turned out beautifully.  I used natural peanut butter and I was worried that the oil from the peanut butter would make my cookies greasey but it worked wonderfully.  I will definately make this recipe again.

The flavor was good.  I'm glad that I read reviews before trying this recipe, because I cut back to 2 eggs and added the 1/4 cup of flour.  They still turned out flat, so I'll try using only one egg next time.  We haven't achieved perfection yet, but it's definitely a good base to work off of!

This was a very good peanut butter cookie recipe. I did follow the advice of others before me & add more flour and only one egg. They did still stick a bit to the fork when being pressed, even after adding a bit more flour. To me, without the fork marks, it just isn't a peanut butter cookie...but I think the next time I will try it without them.

These cookies were GREAT!  I loved them!  Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I also put only 2 eggs in instead of 3.  Worked great!

Well after reading some of the other reviews i decided to start off by only using one egg and adding about 1/4th cup more flour. I have to say that they came out EXCELENT! They spread perfectly and baked up nice and soft. MMMMM! Im going to use this in my Xmas goodies tin to hand out for gifts this holiday season.

Not exactly what I expected....

The dough was way too soft. I think If I try this again, I will eliminate one egg. After the first test batch, I chilled the dough, raised the temp to 350 and only baked them for 10-12 minutes until just golden at edges. The last batch turned out pretty good, much thicker than the first one, which ran and turned too crisp at edges. All batches tasted fine, but I am looking for a thicker cookie.

Pretty good, but very sweet--I can taste the sugar. I took the advice of my fellow cookie chefs and used only 2 eggs.

If you put a little bit of jelly on while they're warm, you have peanut butter and jelly cookies.

I made the recipe exactly like it said, except I added coarsely chopped unsalted peanuts and some white chocolate chunks.  Dropped them by very generous teaspoonfuls.  They came out soft, chewy and delicious.

Recipe was loved by young and old alike.  I added a bag of peanut butter chips and used crunchy peanut butter for a little extra zing. My grandson won't eat any other peanut butter cookies but these now. Needless to say, this gets my thumbs up!

Good....but like other people say wayyyyyy to wet before you put them on the cookie sheet. Stick right to your fingers. I think the problem is the eggs - I've never had a recipe with so many. Usually its no more than 1. I'll try it next time with one. This time I had to save them by adding more flour, but that takes away from the taste so I wont do that next time. Also, for those people who think they were crumbly, you may have had them in too long. I never leave cookies in for more than 12 minutes regardless of the recipe's time. When they look  a little brown around the edges, that means you've over cooked them. The brown colour will show the most after they've been sitting out for 10 minutes. So be sure to take them out before you even see a spot of brown!!

These cookies were sweet, soft & delicious, but best right out of the oven. I made it with 2 eggs rather than 3, on the advice of other reviewers, but the dough was still very creamy. I would make these again. My husband loved them!

I thought these were pretty good, but I think the recipe needs a little more flour to keep the cookies from spreading out too much.  I will try that next time before I give up on this recipe.  They were great with ice cream sandwiched between them too.

I'm going to try this with only 2 eggs next time. The dough was too wet and it
spread itself out into one big, cookie-sheet size, flat cookie. Tasted good, 
though. I like that the recipe calls for 1 whole cup of peanut butter. I don't
trust the recipes that only call for 1/4 cup. How do you get the full peanut
butter flavor from that?

I struggled with the baking part of this recipe.  When I put the dough on the sheet and used the fork, I felt I had plenty of room for the cookies to expand.  All the cookies ran together and since I had used the fork for the lines, the cookies were too crisp.  I opted for a tiny muffin pan and filled them about 1/2 way.  I cooked on 300 (convection) for 20 minutes and they came out much better.  Tasty, just frustrating.

I have been using this recipe for quite some time now and it is definately a winner w/ my friends and family!  I like to add chocolate chips to create the wonderful combination of peanut butter and chocolate.  For anyone who prefers chewy cookies to crispy cookies, this recipe is definately a good choice!

Cookies were too wet, not enough flour in the recipe so the cookies spread all over and were thin. Also, to make them more kid friendly you may want to use sugar to press the cookies down with the fork and put a rosebud on the top.

These are the absolute best peanut butter cookies in the world, bar none! Soft, chewy, and delicious. I have no problem giving them away which is good because I would gladly eat the whole batch myself!

They are more like candy, really chewy and flat but the taste is really delicious!

Yummy,yummy, yummy.  Believe it- people will be asking you for the recipe, so be sure to make copies.  These cookies are soft and chewy- and downright DELICIOUS.  To keep them chewy, store them with a slice of bread.  They were ready in 9 minutes in my oven, not 18, so pay attention to your oven. A definite winner!
