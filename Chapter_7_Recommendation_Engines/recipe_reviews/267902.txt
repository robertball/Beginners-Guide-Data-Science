This is so good!  Glad I made a double batch so there will be enough that I can enjoy it myself for the next few days and still have some for Thanksgiving in 4 days.

This is fantastic. It gets very thick and itâ€™s even tastier the next day. It works well with sweet or savory dishes. I used it on a crostata as well as with meatballs. It was a delicious addition to my oatmeal, too. Thank you for the recipe.
