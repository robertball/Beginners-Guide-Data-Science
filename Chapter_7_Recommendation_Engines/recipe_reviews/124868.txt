I made this casserole and took it to a potluck dinner not long ago.  The combination of flavors is really tasty and the pimentos and green peas give the dish great visual appeal.  Needless to say, this recipe was a hit and I'll definetly make it again.  Only next time, I will add more of the 
milk/flour mixture so that the casserole is a little more moiste.  As is, the casserole comes out just a tad dry for our tastes.

This was really good and very easy! I substituded sour cream for the mayo and didn't have any mushrooms or pimentos. It was a meal that my 17-month-old daughter, meat-loving husband and I (who is not a meat lover) all enjoyed.

I gave this 5 stars because, as far as casseroles go, this is great.  It was refreshing to make a chicken casserole without a can of cream of mushroom/chicken/celery soup.  My whole family liked it.  I added more mushrooms and peas, and skipped the pimentos.  The cornflake topping adds a nice cruch.  Very good overall, and will be making again.

I like this! I would use a whole onion instead of the 3 Tbsp. and I didn't think it needed the crushed cornflakes. I think it was a little dry but I will make it again. I would recommend this recipe and think it would be perfect for potluck at church.

I have to say I had very little expectation when I threw this together but WOW!! It was very flavorful and easy to make, but most important, it was just a great, great meal! I enjoyed it, my husband enjoyed it and I have a feeling the leftovers are going to be even better (a sure sign of a success). I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have celery soup so I used mushroom instead. I also substituted breadcrumbs in melted butter for the topping (had no cornflakes). Could not have been better, seriously.

Recipe has really good flavor.  I agree with other reviewers, increase the milk and mayo slightly and decrease the rice to 2 cups.  Skip the cornflakes, not necessary.

This was very good.  Took longer than I thought to make only because I realized at the last minute I had to cook the rice and chicken ahead of time.  My bad.  I did reduce the mayo and added more milk to keep it moist.  I also didn't put the cornflakes on top.   I didn't have any and didn't feel it needed anything on top.

Delicious and creamy!  I left out the peas, doubled the mushrooms and added more (soy) milk.  I tried cutting the mayo too much and that was not such a good idea, but you can definitely cut some, and i used low fat mayo with no problem.  I fried in olive oil and mixed the cornflake crumbs with just a bit of canola oil and sprinkled. Big hit with my husband and kids!

Addendum:  I made it again already a bunch of times- great recipe/.  I added peas and corn this time and it was yum.  Also, I dont like mayo, just a personal thing, so this time I doubled the whole soy milk, flour thingee and just put in one spoonful of mayo and it came out great- it was also luch less fattening this way. I didnt taste a difference and my kids still liked it.

Very tasty! I did make a few adjustments. I left out the mushrooms, celery, pimentos and the cornflakes. I added some diced carrots to the pan when I cooked the onions/garlic. I topped the casserole with cheddar cheese. I would make this again. I may reduce the mayo a little because it was a bit greasy.

This recipe gets 5 stars by me because I would make it again and would serve it to guests.  Noted some of the suggestions by other reviewers.  Added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the sauce.  No problems with the casserole being too dry.  Also, the crunch of the celergy really added something to this dish.  Used a whole onion (a small one) as suggested by a reviewer.  Next time will try adding a bit of paprika to step up the flavouring.  But even without that, it was very good.  The cornflake topping added something for eye appeal and a bit of crunch too.  Nice change to not use canned soup for a casserole and avoid too much salt.  This recipe goes in my "keepers" file.  Thanks.

I wonder what is the deal with so many chicken casseroles on this site that don't have any seasonings?  Here is another that I made but realized that after about 3/4 of the way in, it was a bit bland.  I added some basil and thyme with some ground pepper and it was much improved.

Just made this tonight.  I halved the directions and it came out perfect!  Very easy.  I did add some sliced baby carrots as my kids like them.  The family ate it up!  I love that this recipe did not call for any can of soup.

This was terrific!! I had to make a bunch of tiny changes due to what I had on hand, but we both loved it and it is a definite keeper - easy to make, too! I doubled the sauce due to some reviewers saying it was dry, and that was a bit much - I think next time I'll just do a 1 1/2 recipe. Lovely!!

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the saltiness, but I guess that was more of the stuffingg

Everyone loved this dish and 2 out of 8 asked for the recipe. I used a lemon-pepper rotisserie chicken because of time. I think that added a lot to the flavor. It was yummy!!!

Love that this recipe doesn't call for canned soup.  On the recommendation of others I added 2 tsp paprika and a whole chopped onion.  On my own, I also subbed canned fat-free milk for the regular milk and increased it by 1/2 cup, used frozen stir-fry veggies and canned mushrooms.  The recipe can be adapted to anyone's taste.  Next time I think I'll add cumin or maybe some jalapeno.  Good basic recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe but left out the pimentos and cornflakes as I didn't have any on hand. I also added broccoli and asparagus pieces in place of peas.  Overall not bad, but tasted kind of bland.  Could have used a kick -maybe some other spices.  Might try with some cumin or paprika next time.  Great for lactose intolerant people due to lack of cream and cheese (I used lactose-free milk).

This was a very comforting chicken casserole.  I made it for some friends who just had a baby. I added water chestnuts to the recipe and used Ritz crackers on top instead of cornflakes.  I also used a rotissary chicken shredded up in it.

My husband liked this but I thought it was kind of dry. I even added extra milk and sour cream (used that instead of Mayo) I'll probably make it again just because my husband liked it but I will make some modifications and maybe I'll like it more :o)

It does take a lot of work putting it together.  One would think it'd be easier just to buy a cream of something soup to substitute all that addtional work to make the sauce.  However, it was very good once finished.

I had soup chicken and soy milk that had to be used up. I did an ingredient search and found this - so glad I did! 
I cut the mayo to 1/2 cup, added a bit more liquid, left out the peppers and the peas, and used broccoli instead. Since some reviewers complained of blandness, I was heavy-handed with the spices and added 2 tsp. paprika. I don't know why anyone left out the cornflake crumbs - it adds a wonderful crunch. This casserole was a huge hit. My daughters each had triples! Thanks.

I liked this recipe.  I avoid recipes that have cream of whatever soups in them.  It grosses me out making it.  I would have given it 5 stars if my husband loved it, but he said he liked it but ased that I not make it again.  Oh well!  i thought it was good.
