I liked the flavor of this cake just the way it is written. It did taste somewhat like a variation of the Jello poke cake only with the orange/creamsicle flavor. I used the hot and cold water in the jello that was poured over the cake. I didn't think it made it too moist. That is the way a jello Poke cake is supposed to be made. It was good to me..not too moist..

Light, moist, and delicious!!  Fun to make and a joy to eat:)  The perfect cool dessert to have on a hot summer day-the flavor combos are endless.  I made my own whipped cream, but other than that followed the recipe exactly-yummm!

This is my husband's favorite cake I made it once for my grandpa out of the ToH book and once Rob tried it I now have to make it every year for his birthday. If you like the dreamsicle bar you will Love this cake!

turned out perfect. If you need a easy cake in a pinch just use the lemon cake with the jello mix and top with cool whip. 

You may also use white cake mix with strawberry.

Tastes are good for a summer time BBQ or 4th of July.

I liked this. I added something to the frosting by putting tangarine pieces in it, I liked the turnout.

Excellent! Followed exactly.  Next time I am going to do a lime cake, and I might use less cool whip in the topping.

The cake was very good if you like orange creamsicles.  I didn't like at first, tying it after I refrigerated it for 2 hours.  It was too  wet and almost mushy. The next morning it was just right after setting up a bit. It was moist and fluffy. So if you can, wait over night to eat it.

this cake is amazing.  i did not use the jello liquid as i made cupcakes and they were wonderful.  the frosting is great, but not for cupcakes so i just added two batches of orange cream cheese frosting (found here on allrecipes) to one for a thicker frosting that would stay on the cupcake.  i made this for my 200 person weekly meal and they DEVOURED them.  great recipe.

I made this cake years ago when I first saw the recipe.  It is absolutely WONDERFUL!!  I made it for dessert when my cousin and her hubby came to dinner for the first time.  They raved about the cake, as did my Hubby who isn't really into sweets. I kept the recipe and have used it over and over again through the years!

This cake definitely needs 24 hours to set up.  If you follow the directions as is, the cake is way too mushy.  I used this recipe as a substitute for my original creamsicle cake recipe because I misplaced it.  I won't be using this recipe again.
