Zucchini Pizza Bake Haiku: "Don't hate my review! I made the 'crust' more like - crust. But, O M G, Wow!" I knew going into this recipe, that no, I wasn't making a pizza-pizza, but the one major change that I did (b/c yikes, that was loads of cheese on the ingredients' list and I didn't want the base to be quiche-like!) was to drop the cheese from the zucchini part, save the parmesan, and sub 1/2 c. italian-seasoned breadcrumbs. Smooshing the zucchini mixture into a pie plate, across the bottom and up the sides, yielded a pie-ish crust that tasted so good! I followed the meat filling exactly, w/ the exception of adding garlic, and letting it simmer for about an hour before spreading it over the zucchini layer. Topped w/ mozzarella, monterey jack, mushrooms and olives and baked again resulted in an unusual, unique pie/pizza/casserole that we absolutely loved. I know that the taste remained, for the most part, what the recipe author intended, but I just felt that swapping cheese for breadcrumbs in the "crust" would hold up better to the meat sauce that was going on top. This was a great way to use up zucchinis (don't forget to drain and press out the moisture really well!), and even better, you can swap out any toppings as you would on a regular pizza. Thanks for a fun, delicious idea Christina!

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I like a spicier dish, so I always add garlic and red pepper flakes are a must.  It is also great with hot italian seasoned turkey sausage.  Basically, anything you like on your pizza would be perfect on the tasty zucchini base.  I may try it next time with mexican seasonings in the beef and add beans.

It needs to be spiced up some.  I would put pepperoni or ham on it next time.  I don't think I will make it again.

I really enjoyed this dish, and not just because it used a lot of things that were about to go bad in my fridge!  I followed the directions pretty much to the letter, except I put all the mozzarella cheese in the crust because I read it wrong.  I added another egg to help it stick together, however, and it turned out great.  I think the third egg really helped solidify the crust.  It doesn't eat like a pizza, but I didn't expect it to, either.  I would love to use this crust on other savory pies...I'm already thinking using it with a tomato pie.  Great recipe, since you can totally use what you have on hand to make it work.  I'm guessing the leftovers are going to be even better, so now I have something to look forward to at work tomorrow.  Thanks!

Tasty, but not exactly a crust.  As long as you go into this meal expecting a casserole and not a pizza with a crust, you will enjoy it!

This was a great recipe! I made a couple of adjustments based on what I had in the house. Used 3 eggs (needed to use them up). Instead of grated Parmesan, I used the large "flakes/chunks" which added some nice pockets of Parmesan flavor. Colby Jack instead of Monterey Jack. A jar of Ragu pizza sauce. Left off the peppers, mushrooms, olives.  It was good the first night, leftovers were even better the next day!

This recipe is excellent!  I'm always looking for ways to use up zucchini and this one was a hit!  I will add different toppings next time.  You can add whatever toppings you like and it would still be great!  I like having the zucchini as the crust then you're not eating alot of carbs!

All the family really liked this, especially the unusual zucchini "crust."  I used "spicy" spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce, which gave it a bit of nice kick!  Next time I will add less  ground beef (or none at all) and add more of other types of pizza toppings such as pepperoni, chicken, etc.

OOPS!  I accidentally skipped the step where you drain the zucchini, but the good news is undrained- the crust part was enough for 2 pie "crusts".  I used 1.5lbs of ground beef, and kept the rest the same as the recipe.  I did add some sliced up turkey pepperoni and some salami under the cheese for more flavor.  The "crust" came out nice and the fiance really liked this a lot!  I thought it was just ok- but that could be because I didn't care for the gr beef I used.  Will probably make this again and use a mixture of gr beef and sausage.  Thanks for a great idea though!

FANTASTIC!!  We are serious pizza lovers and this recipe is just as good as any pizza, but chock full of vegies too!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I did not have any mushrooms so left them out, and I did add fresh chopped garlic to the meat and onions! On top I put three different colored peppers, sliced thin,  and then the black olives on top instead of under the cheese with the chopped green peppers (in case my kids did not like the black olives, then they could easily pick them off of the top)!  It turns out they loved it as it was and my husband said this dish is "just his thing"!  It is definitely a keeper!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Made as per the recipe, this comes out super bland. I loved it, but had to add hot pepper flakes to suit my taste. I shredded the zucchini into my salad spinner, and then spun it a few times after 10 minutes. I also added a few tablespoons of pesto the second time I made it, it was delish.

This was fantastic!  My family loved it.  I absolutely loved the crust and sneaking more veggies into a delicious dish like this.  I omitted the olives and used pepper jack cheese in place of the Monterey Jack because that's all I had.  I also added some pepperoni which probably put the calorie content over the top but man was it good.  I want to try this again maybe without the hamburger and only pepperoni and/or more veggies or only veggies.  I think it would be delicious either way. Thanks!

Wonderful!  The only changes I made were to use a bit less cheese, 3/4c of Jack and 1 1/2 c of Mozzarella and instead of ground beef I used italian turkey sausage.  My husband raved about it, it's definitely a keeper!

Really good!  I only used one egg, and might bake the "crust" a bit longer to get it more browned  I used a can of pizza sauce and added more Italian seasoning and some garlic powder.  I even overlooked the extra cup of shredded cheese, but there was still plenty.  Otherwise was an excellent recipe and rather easy to make.

This is almost identical to a recipe at Taste of Home; The main difference being cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I added about 1/4 cup of potato flakes to the "crust" to help firm it up. Have made this several times now and love it every time! A good way to use up zucchini.

OMG, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this dish..more of a casserole. Everyone loved it...it was devoured in no time! The few changes that I made were... used 3 eggs, increased all the cheeses, added mild italian saus, turkey pepperoni, tomato, pizza sauce instead of tom sauce, garlic, oregano. This is a great, super healthy way to eat what tastes like pizza, and I love pizza...this didn't disappoint!Thanks for posting!!

The family enjoyed this pizza casserole.  I substituted chicken sausage for the ground beef and omitted olives.  My only complaint would be that salting the zucchini to remove the water from it makes the bottom zucchini part very salty for my taste.  I'm not sure how to 'sweat' the zucchini without the salt, but might rinse the salt off the zucchini and then squeeze all of the water out well.  I would make it again.

Great way to use up those veggies!  I added a ton of fresh herbs in place of the dried italian seasoning.  Seemed like a lot of cheese to me.  Might cut back next time.

This came out amazing! I used 1 cup of bread crumbs in the zucchini mix to make it more crusty. I made mine with just peppers and cheese on top since I'm not a fan of mushrooms or black olives, and it was very very good. My husband loved it! I would recommend this to anyone!

Great recipe!  I used summer squash (I did peel it).  I used 3 eggs as other reviewers recommended but I thinks that was too many.  Used cheddar instead of Monterey Jack.  Used tomato basil spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and italian seasoning with great results.  Two of the kids didn't like the crust part, but the others I fooled and they liked it.

I don't usually change recipes around as much as I did with this one, but I didn't have everything I needed to make this as written.  The only ground beef I had in the freezer was made for tacos, so I gave this a Mexican spin.  Instead of mozzarella, I used taco cheese, a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce, and I left out the italian seasoning.  I had some leftover black bean, corn and salsa mix from a previous dinner this week, so I threw that in too.  Topped with about half the cheese called for and this was delicious!  Definitely nothing like a pizza with all the changes I made, but the recipe was a great jumping off point for me.  Hubby and both kids loved it too.

This was great.  I cook for 4 families(my own included) once a week and I made this with zucchini's from our garden.  I followed the recipe (except I just used pizza sauce instead  of Italian-style tomatoes)  I didn't end up using all of the Monterey Jack Cheese either.  It was delicious!  We had no leftovers!  I was able to make half for adults and half for kids just like you would a pizza with toppings and what a great way to use your garden zucchini!!!  I will definitley make again!

This recipe is awesome, it tastes just like pizza. Although I love zucchini, even someone that did not would still love this and you can alter the pizza toppings to what you like.

Not great.  I thought the crust would be crispy and golden.  Instead it was soggy.  WAY too much cheese in the crust.  Maybe would be better adding very little cheese to the zucchini crust.  Tasted like stuffed peppers, but not as good.  Very disappointing.

I've made this a couple of times, with some modifications for our taste. I used turkey Italian sweet sausage instead of the ground beef, tomato basil marinara sauce (Trader Joe's from a jar) instead of the canned tomato sauce, and since my husband really likes Hawaiian pizza, I used chopped fresh pineapple instead of the veggie toppings. He's not a big zucchini fan, but he liked this alot.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The dish was very tasty. It is more of a casserole than a pizza, but the pizza flavor is definitely present. You will not be disappointed.

The original sauce was BLAND, but I perked it up with garlic, a touch of brown sugar, salt, and oregano. It was fantastic. I also added garlic to the "crust", and it came out great. I cooked it on "convection" to firm up the top of the "crust" a little. (5 stars with my changes, 4 for the original recipe because I would not have thought to do this) My family loooooved this, and it will go into our regular rotation. I topped with olives & pepperoni.

We. LOVE. this. dinner. When I tel my hubby we are having  zucchini pizza for dinner, his reply is, " I was hoping you would say that!" We love chopped banana peppers on it, as it adds more flavor and spice (especially if you use the hot banana peppers). I use just salt, pepper, and oregano for flavoring the meat (out of Italian seasoning), and it tastes great! Be sure to drain your zucchini really well and don't skim on the cheese. So, soooooo yummy!!!

All I can say is YUM.  Well, that's not exactly true, I can also say that this was a great versatile recipe.  I left a portion of the casserole without the ground beef, making for a part vegatarian part meat casserole, which is something I always look for in a recipe, since my daughter doesn't eat beef.  YUMMY.

It really was OK--but, for my taste, quite salty.  Great way to use zucchinni--next time I will leave off the olives and probably not use the Parm.

I LOVE this recipe!  I love the use of all the extra zucchini that I have around the house.  It is also great protein.  I do not add the beef to the sauce.  I just top it with whatever veggie is in the fridge and chicken or shrimp

Loved it!! I did increase the cheese just a bit- and added a little minced garlic. I sauted the mushrooms and pepper in olive oil before putting it on the casserole.

3.31.19  Instead of draining the zucchini in a colander, I put it in my salad spinner which removed most of the liquid.  I don’t like to make changes in a recipe the first time I make it, but whoa, this recipe had a boatload of cheese, so I did cut back a bit.  I didn’t remove all the cheese in the crust, but removed some, and replaced it with Italian breadcrumbs which was suggested by another reviewer. I didn’t have Monterey Jack, so I did sub Pepper Jack.   This called for Italian-style tomato sauce which I’ve never seen before and couldn’t find at two stores, so I just used a can of tomato sauce and added some basil, oregano, garlic powder, and some red pepper flakes.  When I make pizza, I do crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.  Today, the meat sauce went on top of the zucchini crust, then I put down the cheese, but not all, my toppings next, then spread the reserved cheese, sprinkled with basil and oregano, and baked for 22 minutes.  For the toppings, I used turkey pepperoni, caramelized onions, sliced pimento-stuffed olives, and some red bell pepper strips, all in small amounts.   Wasn’t quite sure what to expect from the zucchini crust, but not  to worry.   What you end up with is a pretty tasty pizza casserole.  No, you can’t eat it with your hands, it’s not pizza, it’s a casserole, but I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

This was so delicious!  I have embraced the keto lifestyle, so this is just what I was looking for!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except used venison sausage and red/yellow peppers instead of green peppers. My husband really enjoyed it. If I can keep making keto dinners like this he will be all on board!  Thank you!

this is very good.  since I do strict keto, I limit the sauce (you can use Rao brand if you are restricted carbs/keto).  I do add some garlic and onion powder, dried basil to the bottom crust mixture for more flavor.  I just spread a thin layer of sauce rather than combining with the ground beef.  sometimes I change it up and just slice up some pepperoni, red onion, mushroom.  The crust serves as a nice base for other things, and is a synch to prepare.

This was a great recipe because it got my husband to eat vegetables, something he doesn’t do a lot of. Next time I will probably add a half a cup breadcrumbs to the crust mixture, Just to give it a little more of a crust-like texture.

The "crust" was a little eggy for my preference. If I think of it as a breakfast or brunch casserole, it's perfect. I used two pie plates because my 9 x 13 wasn't available. That worked.

One word YUM!!  The only cheese i put in the crust was the parmesan to save calories and it was good, but the texture wasn't very crust-like.  Then, I put just a sprinkle of mozzarella on top.  I can imagine how good it would be if made according to the recipe as written.  I will definitely make it again.

I doubled the recipe for our large family & put it into a 10x13 pan & a 8x8 square pan. We topped it with the ground beef & homemade pizza sauce mixture, mushrooms, black olives, & mozzarella. What a great use of zucchini!

I've made this twice now.  Very good flavor, and a great way to use up zucchini.  The second time, I used Italian sausage with the ground beef.  Very very good.  Next I will try this dish with a Mexican flair.  This is a fine recipe on it's own, but also a good base recipe for changing it up.  Thank you!

This zucchini pizza bake was awesome! The only things I did differently, was I added a lot of Italian spices and less cheese, but that’s just me. I’m sure as is would be awesome too.

This was excellent and an awesome way to use up some of my garden zucchini.  As other reviewers suggested, I did season a bit more;  I added garlic to the sauce as well as pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and red pepper flakes.  My family does not care for mushrooms or olives so I added thin sliced onions along with the peppers and pepperoni. I also used some cheddar cheese.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is excellent. I took the advice of one of the other cooks and substituted 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs for the 1/2 cup of mozzarella in the crust. Otherwise I remained true to the recipe. Make sure to really squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the zucchini before mixing it with the eggs and cheese. The flavors and texture were amazing! What a great way to use up some zucchini!

Our neighbour gave us a huge zucchini from her yard yesterday. My husband said, don't you have a zucchini crust pizza recipe? Don't know where it went so I came to Allrecipes as usual, and this recipe showed up first on my feed - before I entered a search word! Thank you Universe.  The recipe is perfect as-is I'm sure, but I couldn't help myself and made a couple of minor changes.  Swapped one half cup of the mozzarella in the crust with one half cup of bread crumbs; used old cheddar instead of Monterrey Jack; used fresh seasoned ground  pork instead of beef - both because that's what I had on hand. Then topped with what we had - red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, hot sausage. We enjoyed our "deep dish pizza" and then took a few pieces to the neighbours who had supplied the zucchini. They loved it!  Thanks Christina!

First of all, I didn't add the cheese in the zucchini mixture, but before adding the meat mixture, I added some mozza on top. Then for the meat mixture, I finely chopped onion, one green pepper, one eggplant (which I had peeled and diced), and diced two garlic gloves. Once the veggies were well cooked, I added the ground beef simmered that for awhile, then added the tomato sauce. My family of boys like it! Definetely a keeper! I wonder if a could do the same thing with the zucchini with another veggie...like carrots or sweet potatoes! yum!

I love this. It’s so delicious!!! My husband said he could eat the entire thing! I used pepperoni and salami instead of beef, added a little sriracha to the sauce, and put some cayenne/seasoning in the zucchini mix before baking it. No need to measure after making the crust - just eyeball amounts to your liking. Try it! I’ll definitely be making this again.

We loved this dish! It was so good I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers. I did change a couple things... I use hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef, my favorite pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce and left off the black olives and mushrooms. Sooo good will defiantly make again.

Very tasty. I couldn't find Italian tomato sauce so used a can of the lowest sodium tom. sauce I could find and added 2 Tbs P.C. Italian seasoning, a dash of oregano and a dash of pizza spice and let it simmer with the beef & onion while the 'crust' layer finished baking. My DH and I ate 3/4 of the pan for dinner!  I will make this again as it used so many ingredients I have on hand this time of year.

Big hit at our house with kids and adults alike. I substituted marinated artichoke hearts for the bell peppers, and that gave it excellent flavor.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I wasn't sure the number of zucchinis to buy but four large ones worked for me.  I also didn't know if I should have used fresh Parmesan cheese or out of the green can.  I used the green can and it worked fine but think next time I think I'll use just 1/4 cup.  Also next time I'm also going to eliminate the Monterey Jack cheese completely both in the crust and on top.  Two cups of mozzarella cheese is plenty - one cup in the crust and one cup for the topping.  I noticed several comments that it needed to be spicier so I used regular tomato sauce but instead of Italian seasoning, I added 1/3 package McCormick's Original Taco Seasoning Mix and made it very tasty - add more if you want it spicier.   I also sauted the bell pepper with the ground beef and onions and added the mushrooms and olives to the meat/sauce mixture.  I topped it with one cup of Mozarella cheese and it was delicious.  Although the recipe says it only takes 30 minutes to prep, it took me an hour but it was certainly worth it.

This recipe was delicious!! I took the advice of another reviewer and subbed a 1/2 cup of garlic and herb bread crumbs (Progresso- the garlic/herb added so much flavor!) for the cheddar jack cheese in the crust. One (divided) 2 cup bag of shredded mozzarella was plenty for the whole dish. Also used 1/2 jar of vodka sauce since I didn't have cans of tomato sauce on hand and added (drained) diced Italian style tomatoes to the meat filling along with some garlic powder. Hearty casserole type dish that felt relatively healthy due to the veggie crust and toppings. Was time consuming to make but not hard at all. Highly recommend!

Loved it! Followed Rock_Lobster's advice regarding the crust, and we loved the results. I have to admit: I didn't follow the sauce recipe (just didn't have the ingredients), but I just topped it with what we had (majority of the cheese first, then fresh veggies and rotisserie chicken, then a thin layer of topping cheese, and it was delicious! Both husband and I loved it!

I used a reviewer's suggestion to leave shredded cheese out of the zucchini layer (though I left in the Parmesan), and added 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs. I used ground turkey instead of beef and used sliced fresh mozzarella as my only cheese. Kids hate zucchini but voted this as a make again meal. Yay!

There is really no way to describe this dish. The flavors don't go well together and the "crust" is very soggy. I almost threw the whole pan out but after spending so much on the ingredients (all organic too!) I put it in the fridge. The 2nd say it was better - it was edible/tolerable but it was hard getting it down. Sorry but this just wasn't for me.

We will make this again. 

The crust is quiche like and adds plenty of taste, I mean salt. However, if you squeeze ALL of the liquid out of the zucchini and I mean all such as squeeze in a towel or cheese cloth it will eliminate most of the added salt  and keep the crust  firm.  BTW amazing how much liquid is in a zucchini.

This was good! I read other's reviews that it was a bit bland so I seasoned the ground turkey with 4 tbsp of my home made taco seasoning instead of the italian seasoning. It was very tasty but a little overpowering, next time I make this I'll use 2 heaping tbsp.

To make it 'crustier', I swapped the tomato sauce with 6oz of tomato paste. The cheese still worked to hold it together nicely without soaking the 'crust' with all that wet sauce

I made this for dinner and it was yummy. You must not expect a pizza, but a casserole instead. Still, we enjoyed it and, as mentioned, you can put whatever pizza toppings you prefer. I used store-bought pizza sauce, hot turkey sausage (cooked and crumbled) onions, sliced olives, green pepper (home grown), pepperoni, and pineapple chunks. Start early. It takes time to assemble and bake. For week nights, bake the zucchini crust in advance to shorten the prep time. (I added a dinner roll (processed fine) to the zucchini mixture and I'm not sure it made it any more crusty.) Update: I made it on an insulated cookie sheet and it was better.

Great recipe for using what you have on hand. I had 2 zukes, which equaled about 2 cups shredded, so basically halved the recipe. Also had about 1/4 lb already cooked leftover hamburger, so sauteed the onion and bell pepper in a little butter, then added the cooked beef and tomato sauce (8oz can, no salt added). Like several other reviewers,  I added  a little garlic powder and shaved parm to the crust mixture and a pinch of crushed red pepper to the sauce while simmering. My hubby and I like different toppings so used 2 small (6') pie dishes, which probably made the crust too thick, but still great! Loved the crispy edges of the crust.

I have made this as written, using the original version that appeared a long time ago in Taste of Home magazine, with less cheese and vegetarian.  It's a good way to use zucchini and my boys didn't notice the difference when I made a vegetarian version using a mix of sautéed mushrooms and textured soy protein. I find it easier to use pizza sauce that I often have on hand rather than the seasoned tomato sauce, but in terms of taste the difference probably depends more on the brands of tomato and pizza sauce used rather than which one you use.  This is a recipe that can be adjusted based on toppings you like and what you have on hand.  Use pizza sauce, marinara, yellow squash, add some onions or not, use a meat substitute.... It will all work.  Just follow your taste buds.

Skipped olives.  Some of mozzerella in crust was subbed for panko(,1/2 C. panko then do 1/2 C  less mozzerella)  as suggested by another review. Needs some spices like garlic, basil, or Italian herb blend. Either add in a good pinch of fennel to ground beef, to give a sausage flavor w/o upping sodium or sub in some Italian turkey sausage ( hot or sweet or a bit of each) fo 1/4 to r 1/2 of ground beef.  Just be super sure you drain zucchini  THEN SQUEEZ VERY DRY in paper towels. Also be sure zucchini layer is level thickness to get an even crisp crust with out spongy spots. Let crust cool completely before topping helps too.  As long as you do not try to rush the "crust"  this is quite a versatile recipe. By the way this same idea would also work for cauliflower  crust. Check for recipes here or on sites like  foodnetwork  etc.

Great recipe! I used prosciutto, turkey bacon, and pepperoni instead of ground beef and I used more Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I think it would taste great served over penne.

I followed the other suggestions and added garlic to the meat I didn't use onion (allergy)  I didn't dry the zucchini either.  This was fantastic, sort of like a vegetable lasagna.  Pizza is the wrong name but it is great!!!

I am recently retired and doing more "from scratch" cooking. I found a recipe very similar to this in one of our local papers and tried it. It called for ground turkey and shredded cheddar instead of the Monterey Jack. I also added pepperoni and black olives to the toppings list. We really enjoyed this casserole. I took some to my mom and she loved it.  Will definitely make it again.  I am loving allrecipes.com!

This is a family favorite!! I've got 3 kids under the age of 10 and although my husband and I do enjoy spice, my kids do not (they think mint is spicy). SO, that being said, this is such a versatile dish - you can keep as is or spice up. I omit the olives and the dish is PERFECT as it is! Thank you!!

Have a ton of zucchini, and wanted to make something new.  Hubby loved it, so made it when the grandkids were here for the weekend.  Even the super picky one asked if he could take the leftovers home!  I drained the zucchini in cheesecloth so I could squeeze the liquid out easier.  I did vary the type of cheese to what I had on hand.  A great recipe that can be easily changed to fit your tastes and pantry!

Awesome. I made it pretty close to actual recipe. I don't have anything cheese wise  but Parmesan and cheddar. Next time I may add some red wine to the sauce.
