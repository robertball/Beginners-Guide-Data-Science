My mother made almost the exact recipe when I was little. Only she added banannas, which really made it the best!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten and easy to make too!  It is perfect for a child's birthday cake, because it teaches them that heatlhy things taste good. (Not too healthy but alright)  IT WAS AWESOME AND I GIVE IT 100 THUMBS UP!!!!

Very tasty.  I did not use the same fruit.  I used strawberries, blueberries, peaches, and kiwi.

I had to add a second pack of cream cheese.  And I played with the fruite becasue the strawberries at the stor were not lookigso good.  I did a green apple and bananas instead.  I melted a 1 square of chcolate and piped it over the top.  It looked it was a picture, and it tasted jsut as good as it looked.

This was yummy, I really liked the choice of fruit as toppings, and the cream cheese topping was great.  I used the pillsbury refrigerated cookie dough, and it made the whole thing a little too sweet for me.  I think that I'll look for a better sugar cookie recipe and try this again.
