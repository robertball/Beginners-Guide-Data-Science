I changed nothing. I mixed it with my kitchen aid ice cream mixer on low for 15 minutes turned out perfectly. Loved by all members of my family

I'm giving it 4 stars because I think it needs a little cream--I used 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream. The instructions are very clear and it tastes just like Culvers! I love that it uses inexpensive panty ingredients.

The ice cream is amazing.  You won't get this at the grocery store.  But let's drop the word "simple".  This is a time consuming recipe.  Basically what you are making is a creme anglaise that  you freeze.  I spent  about 20 minutes  stirring the  "custard".  You can't do it quickly or you burn it.  So,  it's great ice cream, but simple it ain't..

Very rich & creamy. I could have eaten the whole thing myself. I took it to a potluck and received many compliments

I needed a stick blender to remove lumps of cocoa powder, other than that I followed the instructions exactly.  The flavor was good, but nothing to brag about.
