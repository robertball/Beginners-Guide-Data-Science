Extremely sweet. I made another recipe almost identical to this but with a bit less pineapple juice. Both are very very sweet. Next time I will try it without the sugar and only add a little at a time if needed. Thanks for sharing.

I absolutely love this punch. Never had anything else like it. Great for almost any occasion.
