For those of you that couldn't get your lentils to cook: Adding any acid food such as tomatoes will slow down the cooking time and you'll end up with hard lentils. Add tomatoes after the lentils are nearly cooked through. This should be in the cooking directions. I also added cajun seasoning, onion, garlic, fresh parsley etc. served with corn bread like red beans and rice. Yum

I love lentils and was looking for a little something different to do with them when I happened upon this recipe. Well, lets just say I could not keep my husband from dipping into the crock pot over and over again before it was time for dinner. This was really wonderful! I did make two changes though. Instead of using plain diced tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes with green chilis. I also chopped up a small onion and put it into the mix. I gave this recipe 5 stars because I think it would have been wonderful without the changes I made, we just like our food with a little bit of a "bite" to it. Not only was this meal yummy, but very economical as well. I served with warm crusty bread and a big salad and I was able to feed my family of 5 for under $10.00, with leftovers to boot. Thank you so much, I will be making again for sure!

Incredible recipe - easy, fast, tastes great! (but IS filling! :) We like some spice & flavor so I used 1 can of Ro-tel (tomatoes & green chilis) instead of plain tomatoes & did NOT drain the can. I like carrots so I added 3 large ones cut into 1 inch chunks & more celery too - fyi veggies tend to dissolve in slow cookers so the larger pieces do fine with longer/all day cook times. Mine was ready in 5 hrs on high in  a crock pot (used small brown lentils). When I am cooking it while at work all day, I'll add large/regular lentils and leave pot on low for 8-9 hours. This recipe is so high in protein & fiber, is easy & inexpensive to make - what more do you need in a recipe?! Thanks a million Tanya!
Oops - forgot to say I added 1/2 large onion, chopped, and 2tsp fresh minced garlic! Don't forget it - it makes a difference!

Excellent! *Easy* way to cook lentils. Strangley, I used a can of rotel since I didn't have a can of tomatos, and added onion and garlic. It was wonderful. Be careful not to overcook and end up with mushy lentils.

First time with lentils and it turned out very good - I added one garlic clove and one medium size onion.  I served it with a shot of red pepper sauce for a little kick!

My husband and toddler are such big fans - I get rave reviews for this simple, no-hassle dish!  I added twice as many carrots and celery, as well as onion and a dash of cayenne.  I don't have a slow-cooker, but the lowest setting on the stovetop worked just fine! Next time I'll try a little spinach and some spicier sausage.

This was great. I used lowfat kielbasa and was surprised how hearty and satisfying this was.

This is a good starter.  I've been making lentil soup for years.  Here are the additions that I use:  Fry 4 slices of bacon (cut in half) until crisp.  Set bacon aside.  Then sauté one onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 stalk of celery and 2 sliced carrots in the bacon grease.  Put 1 lbs of dry lentils in the crock pot and add 8 cups of ham stock.  Add the sautéed vegetables and 2 tbls. of Dijon mustard.  Add 2 bay leaves and mix well.  Cook on low for 6 hours, then add one can of diced tomato with chiles.  Cook for another 2 hours then slice the sausage in even rings and brown for 5 – 8 minutes until browned on both sides (I usually use Polish Kielbasa) and add to the lentils.  Just before serving, add a splash of wine vinegar.

This was a delicious, satisfying stew, perfect for a fall or winter evening or perhaps for a Boxing Day lunch. The recipe didn't specify red or green lentils. I made it with red lentils, and it was perfect. Even my five-year-old son ate it, and that says a lot. Very quick and easy to make. My crock pot is my new best friend!

This recipe made me go out and buy a crock pot. I hate making lentils on top of the stove for fear of them drying out or burning if I forget about them. I never thought to try and do it in a crock pot. This was great. I also used fat franks cut in half the 2nd time I made it because family with little kids was coming to visit and it was still a hit.

Very hearty and satisfying but not enough zip for my crew.  Will probably add some spices or onions next time.

I was not impressed with this.  It seemed very bland, and no one really liked it.  I added a chopped onion, but other than that, I stuck right to the recipe.

This is a nice, hearty stew. I used four carrots and only one pound sausage. It's important to add spices (I added cajun and a dash of red pepper) as well as one onion and two cloves garlic. We happened to have some cooked noodles which I threw in and they were great - next time I'd add them to the slow cooker 15 minutes before serving.

Very good.  These are the changes I made: doubled carrot and celery, also added 1/2 cup chopped onion and 2 cloves garlic.  Used chicken broth instead of beef.  Used Rotel tomatoes with chilis instead of diced tomatoes, not drained. Used Hillshire Farm Spicy Sausage instead of Kielbasa (we prefer our food spicy).  Cooked on high in slow cooker for 4 hours.  Had to add another 1.5-2 cups of broth when done because it was too thick.  Also, lentils were a little softer than I like...I'll try cooking on low next time.  Served with cornbread and Tabasco sauce for even more of a kick.

As other reviewers said, this smells great while cooking.  I'm so glad I tried this again today after reading about waiting on the diced tomatoes.  The first time I tried it my lentils were almost crunchy, I guess b/c I put the tomatos in at the beginning and it prolonged cooking time.  I waited until the end today and they were perfect.  My children had eaten the carrots, but it was great without them.  I put in a diced onion and some garlic.  Even using the mild diced tomatos and chilis, it had a little kick.  I thought it was great, but my kids kind of whined.  I will make this again, especially on cold/rainy days!

I really love easy recipes that taste great, and this one was easy and it taste great!  I followed the recipe to the letter except for the two cans of water.  I couldn't get an extra can of water into my slow cooker, but it turned out great anyway.  What I loved best about this recipe is that I didn't have to add any seasoning (salt pepper) at all.  The sausage did all the work!!!

This was good but I expected it to be thicker. It was like a stew for sure. To make it healthier, I used turkey kielbasa and it was very good.

This was delicious and very easy.  I followed others' modifications and added an onion.  I also didn't drain the tomatoes.  To reduce the calories, I used low fat turkey kielbasa and only put in one pound instead of two.  My lentils came out perfect.  I'll definitely make this again.

OK this is not completely done yet - but it is oh so good!!! I did what a reader suggested and added tomatoes just now - the lentils are cooked almost all the way through - since this is the first time I'm making this dish, I hope this was a wise decision!! I added some minced garlic and some homemade taco/chili seasoning (can't remember what is in the container!) and it tastes divine!!! I believe it is taco seasoning that I compiled from this site! Adding fresh green beans as a side dish and we are golden for tonight's pre - Father's day/birthday dinner!!! Thank you SORSHA24 for your recipe!!!

As others have mentioned, the cook time is off. After three hours on high, lentils were still crunchy. Had to cook it for another hour and a half at least. Two pounds of sausage is also a little excessive. I used one pound and even that was a little much. It made the stew greasier than it needed to be. Lentils are plenty hearty on their own and very high in protein. I doesn't need all that sausage. It just gets soggy and spongy after four and a half hours on high anyway. You could use all the same ingredients and cook this recipe on the stove in twenty minutes. I'd fry the sausage in a skillet first, then saute the carrot and celery in the sausage-greased pan along with some onion and garlic, and add all that into the pot with the other remaining ingredients. It would be so much faster.

This is so easy and so good! I halved the recipe and omitted the celery (didn't have any). I also used chicken broth instead of beef and turkey kielbasa (that's what I had on hand). My husband loves this!

This was very tasty--but I, like others, added some stuff I think really helped boost the flavor. I started with sauteeing a whole onion, 3 carrots and some celery, about 3 cloves garlic.  Then added the lentils, a little thyme, and used veggie broth and water.  Added in Rotel tomatoes close to the end.  I did mine in the stovetop and it took less than 40 minutes. I also used soy chorizo as the 'sausage'. It was excellent. Served mine over brown rice. Really really tasty.

I felt that it needed more veggies, so I cut up 2 potatoes, and 1 large onion, diced. I also got the stuff going in the crock pot before I went to work, and when I got home I dumped the tomatoes in and it was ready by the time I got the table set. Thanks For sharing! :)

This was really delicious! This has defintely made its way into our dinner rotation. I have tried different lentil recipes with ham, and by far the sausage makes a difference. What an easy dinner to make!

An absolutely delicious recipe. I used Italian sausage (cooked and sliced) instead of kielbasa, added some chopped onion and a few cloves of garlic while I browned the sausage, upped the carrots, tossed in two diced potatoes and added bouillion to the water. It cooked MUCH faster than the recipe stated - the lentils were tender after about 4 hours on low (when I added tomato sauce instead of tomatoes).

Delicious...I´m sure this will become a regular on our dinner table!  And so healthy!!!
I actually cooked this recipe for 4.5hrs on High, but ´that´s probably the fault of my slow cooker, not the recipe!!  
This made lots and was just as well, as we all went back for a second helping!

Made this for our family tradition of eating lentils for prosperity on New Year's eve.  Served it over homemade spaetzle. It is easy and delicious.  The only thing I would do differently is use only 2 cups of water and add a can of tomatoes.  If you like it more like a stew, take the cover off after cooking a few hours to reduce the liquid. A splash of wine vinegar after cooking gives it a nice kick.  Enjoy.

A little bland, but good.  It makes a lot so I cut the recipe in half.  Will probably make again next winter.

Fabulous!  Added Rotel tomatoes in place of diced tomatoes during the last 30 mins.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. This is our second time making it. I work a late shift so I don't have the time to cook dinner like I used to. This little crockpot has become a dinner saver. The first time followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious. But it needed a little more flavoring so we added 8 cloves of garlic, an onion, some 7 seasons, and paprika and it was delicous. we are garlic eaters so we use alot of garlic and seasoning thats just our preference but with or without the additions its delicious either way. I also cut down the sausage. I only used one and again thats just our taste preference the meat just got a little much for us. Overall easy and delicous and makes enough to go in lunch for the next day ;)

Wonderful!  An awesome winter meal!  I took other's advice and added the tomatoes at the end; it worked great.  The only thing I did different was add an onion because my hubby and I love onions.  It was so easy too; no precooking anything!  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe! Even my 14 month old daughter ate every bite! I did add a few seasonings: garlic, onion, and some red pepper flakes for an extra kick. However, I did not do this till the last hour. I tasted it before adding it and still loved it, but I thought my husband would like a little more kick. I also used diced tomatoes with garlic and herbs in it as it was what I had. I will definitely make this our go to lentil recipe!

The texture of the sausage gets a bit odd after sitting in the slow cooker for so long. Having said that, the flavor is great...and I haven't had any problems with the lentils cooking through.

I made this with my family at homeschool, and I would not change anything about the Lentils and Kielbasa.  I think it is really good, and I hope you do also.  I had the lentils and kielbasa on September 30, 2010.

I've made this recipe several times and each time it gets better and better! I followed the recipe as written the first time and it was wonderful!   If you want a more intense flavor, use Rotel mild or spicy tomatoes, which will definitely enhance the flavor and NO ONE will be able to resist.   I've found that any type sausage works especially if you use the Rotel tomatoes.  I used turkey sausage and I also slice the sausage and cook it in the microwave for a few minutes before adding to the crock pot.  This deceases the amount of fat added to the dish.  My husband never had lentils and was not open to trying them until the aroma took him completely away.  Now he asks when will I be making this dish again!  I think that now I will try to get him to eat Quinoa!

This is an easy, tasty, fairly nutritious meal my whole family enjoyed.  I added a large chopped onion and a minced clove of garlic.  Didn't have celery on hand so used 3 carrots cut into large chunks.  Put everything except tomatoes into the crock pot and cooked on high for 2.5 hours, then added tomatoes and cooked on high for another hour.  It came out perfect.  Kids liked a little dollop of sour cream on theirs.  Served with crusty bread and salad.  A great busy-day meal!

I have been curious about lentils for a while because they are so healthy, and this was my first try cooking them. The ingredients were pretty basic and inexpensive, and the other reviews were so right when they said it smells great cooking. This would be a great dish to put in the crockpot in the morning and leave to cook all day while you're at work. True, it tastes better the second day. Seems like it would freeze well, so make a big batch.

I made a few modifications: I only used one pound of sausage and I added three cloves of garlic, an onion and about 2 teaspoons of dried thyme.  It turned out really well, but the lentils could have been cooked longer (I cooked them for 6 1/2 hours on low).  We ate it with some crusty bread and red wine.  Yum!  It makes a TON of stew, so I will cut the recipe in half next time.  It makes a great lunch to take to work.  I will definitely make this one again!

I have to say, for my first try at making lentils, it was pretty darn easy thanks to this recipe!  I did nothing different other than to use only 2 cups of water.  Salt and peppered to taste.  Thanks for a great recipe to keep!

I substituted fat free chicken broth for the beef broth, turkey keilbasa instead of pork, added an onion, 3 cloves of garlic, an extra can of diced tomatoes, red-skinned paotaoes and no water.  I took a little over 6 hours in my crock pot set on high.  My husband and I both like it, and it is great for the winter months.  The best thing is that the lentils are packed with fiber and protein and the turkey keilbasa only has 2 grams of saturated fat per 2 oz.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

The recipe was very easy to prepare. I doubled the carrots, celery,
one half of a large onion, and two cloves of garlic. The dish was comfort food to all that shared the meal.

I LOVE this recipe!!  The only changes I made were the following: used turkey sausage in lieu of kielbasa (not 2lbs, just about 1lb, although I think next time I will use the 2lbs. as suggested), put some seasonings in it, minced garlic, double the carrots & celery, a few dashes of hot sauce; and most importantly, per suggestions of others on this site, I put the tomatoes (tomatoes with diced green chilies) in toward the end of cooking time--about the last 1/2 hour..I think this really makes a difference in the lentils cooking properly.  Cooked it approximately 7 hours (on low) total.  It was spectacular!

I made this for the first time last night and loved it!  I made a few changes...I didn't have celery, so I doubled the carrots.  I also added half of a chopped onion, used hot sausage, a chopped jalapeno and a can of diced tomatoes with chilies for the perfect amount of kick.  Super easy and economical!  I think this stew may have become a staple.

Wish I could give 3.5 stars.  Cooked it as printed.  Should have used a large size crockpot, it lifted the lid on my regular one after four hours.  Also recommend using high grade of polish sausage for better results.  Like the flavor and will try it again.

Nice basic recipe that's easy to put together.  Will definitely make this again.  I added onion and garlic based on other reviews (though probably would have added them anyway as we love onion and put it in almost everything) and used turkey kielbasa.  The beef broth and kielbasa season it perfectly that it doesn't need any additional salt.  My picky family member who doesn't like spice loved it and I found it quite good as well, though would maybe sprinkle a couple drops of hot sauce or some Aleppo pepper flakes in my own portion.  Three hours on high in my crock didn't seem to cut it though and I had to cook it for about five.

I think this was simple, cheap, and delicious. I sauteed up some onion, and added a dash of cayenne to those, and I used veggie broth and turkey sausage because that is what I like. I also used canned tomatoes with peppers, and didn't drain them. 

It had a really nice kick and was a perfect winter dish. I was happy to eat leftovers for three days. I only gave it a 4 instead of 5 because i think without the added spice it may have been a bit bland, but with these minor changes it was pretty amazing, so it would probably be good.

I could take or leave this. It made a lot but I really didn't want to eat it more than twice.

This was very good.  I made it with double the carrots and celery and used only one lb. of Lite Kielbasa.  After about 6hrs on low things were not as soft as I wanted them so I turned it to high for 2 more hours at that point.  After that, I added a beef boullion because I thought it needed a little extra flavor and that helped.  I used 1/2 onion chopped and 2 garlic cloves also.  My sausage was not mushy at all and I loved this. It was like a hearty lentil stew.  Will definitely make again!

pretty good... not great. I guess I just don't like lentils all that much. I added some tomato soup to take the edge off the earthy tones from the lentils. might try again..... not my favorite.

we loved this recipe!!  I browned the sausage in a frying pan w/ a half an onion (chopped)before adding it to the rest of the ingrediants.  I also added 1 beef bouillon cube and a 1/2 teaspoon of a garlic herb seasoning mix that came w/ my bag of lentils.  Turned out excellent, even the kids (4 & 3) loved it!  I am making it again tonight (I made it for the first time about a week and a half ago) and the whole house smells delicious right now!

So honestly, this recipe was okay the night I made it, but was really good the following day. I will admit it doesn't look pretty, but I don't have kids to worry about. This is a good tasting recipe, especially if you find a good sausage. I used a Jimmy Dean sage sausage, and it had a good flavor. I have just started using my slow cooker, and used a previous suggestion of cooking it on low for 10 hours. Well things were mushy (but still tasted good), I probably would have cooked it on low for 7 hours.

I started putting water in before I realized I didn't have enough lentils so I added more carrots and a can of new potatoes so it wouldn't be watery.  With the additions it was wonderful. I only give it a four because without the extra veggies there wouldn't have been enough for me.

I liked this recipe but waited and browned my sausage and then added it with one hour left to the slow cooker. I liked it better this way my sausage was not mushy.  Good flavors.

I had no kielbasa, so I put Chorizo in the dish and it tasts wonderful. What a great dish! I never had lentils before, but I wanted to try them. Never found a recipe that truly appealed to me.
I used fresh tomatoes. I will definately make this again!

Pretty good recipe - my husband and I both liked it.  My son wasn't so crazy about all the tomatos, so maybe next time I'll cut the amount in half.  Very tasty and easy to prepare.  Great on a chilly night with some biscuits or cornbread.

Very Good.  Our family really likes this.  I made this for my brother and wife who are a little "skeptical".  They liked it.  Easy to prepare and tasty on a cold night.  I make cornbread with it.

We enjoyed this very much!  I used French green lentils, only 1 lb. of (turkey) kielbasa and reduced the water by 1c.  The results were delicious.  We will definitely make this again!

I had never tried Lentils before until I made this recipe. It turned out very good, and I used super spicy sausage to give it a kick. This recipe is so easy...just throw all your ingredients in the slow cooker before work and it's ready when you get home!

This is a really great recipe for those who love lentils. It took a little longer than 3 hours in my slow cooker on high, but its still great! We usually add garlic, potatoes, onion, carrots and a dash of chili powder in addition to the ingredients.

Good recipe. I will make this again. I used chicken broth because that's what I had in my pantry. I also added a lot more carrots because I love them in this sort of recipe. I served this with cornbread and hot sauce on the side. YUM.

This turned out really well.  My fiance absolutely loved it.  In addition to adding onions and garlic as other poster suggested, I also added some ground cumin and a touch of tabasco.  The cumin really made a world of difference.

My whole family thought this was really tasty.  I added the tomatoes after a few hours of cooking on high like recommended and the lentils cooked through fine.  I also added onions and garlic and used chicken broth instead of beef.  Very, very good flavor.  As far as the looks go, anyone used to eating lentils knows that they're not the prettiest things but taste great!  I made a salad and garlic bread on the side and it was delicious.

This was very good.  I added a small chopped onion to my recipe and before serving, I poured about a 1/4 cup olive oil into the mix.  The olive oil really makes a difference.  For added flavor and kick, I cut up some Jalapeno peppers into my bowl (not everybody in my family appreciates hot peppers).  I didn't put the parmesan cheese on top but I did serve with garlic bread.  My whole family loved it!

Great family dinner, with potential. Whole family loved the flavor, although I did add a couple of cloves of garlic. Lentils definitely needed to be cooked longer and hotter than the recipe calls for.  Would recommend at least 10 hours on low, or 6 - 7 on high.

This was quite tasty for the small amount of effort involved.  I only used 1 lb of sausage(smoked sausage, all I had on hand).  I added 2 extra carrots and used reconstituted beef boullion instead of broth.  My slow cooker had this cooked perfectly in about 2 hours on high(really fast, any longer and it would have been a pot of brown mush).  You might want to stay at home the first time you make this so you can see how long it will take to cook in your slow cooker(I have found they vary quite a bit in heat output).

Great recipe.  Instead of water I used an ale beer.  Added more carrots, a diced onion and peeled and diced potatoes.  Turned out very well, although the potatoes turned brownish and for a more appealing look I would boil them separately the next time.  Very flavorful!

Made some modifications based on what other people wrote. I doubled the veggies. Added chopped onion (maybe 1/2c), 2 cloves chopped garlic, 2 bay leaves and a tsp of thyme. Added the tomatoes during the last half hour of cooking. I should have added more water at the beginning... it was a bit overdone at the top when I got home from work. Very filling, great with a nice piece of bread. I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but I will probably make this again. Next time I will add more water, and possibly a diced potato.

I think the recipe was great as is. I have alot of health issues and a very sensitive stomach and  its so difficult to find recipes that aren't spicy. And going out to eat is nearly impossible almost every resturant has too much spicies in their food. So this recipe is greatly appreciated. Thank you SORSHA.

I cooked this on High for 3 hours and it wasn't done. It needed another hour and a half before the lentils were done! The flavor was just Ok. It really needed more spice.

Simple and tasted good. Used vegetable broth in place of the water. 
The second time we made this I bumped up the veggies, 3 carrots, 3 celery and 1 large yellow onion, chopped.

Apparently nine hours on low is too long to cook this... I started it before I left for work and did not get home as early as I had hoped. It ended up pretty mushy; it kind of looked like refried beans to me. I browned the turkey sausage and added it with the tomatoes when I got home, then turned the crock pot to warm for the 20 minutes before we ate. To me a crock pot recipe is only beneficial when I can turn it on before I go to work and enjoy the meal when I get home. This recipe does not fit that description. I do like how healthy and economical it is, but I probably won't make it again. I will stick to the Beefy Lentil Vegetable Soup from this site (which I HIGHLY recommend) to get my lentil fix :)

I liked this! I didn't use the exact measurements, though so my rating might not be too accurate. I used less sausage, less water, more celery and carrots and I added onion and seasoning. It came out thicker and more chili-like which I enjoyed. Next time I will use more liquid and see if I like it more soupy. Thanks for this great recipe!

I thought that this had good taste but I was expecting something a little thicker, for some reason it turned out a little more like soup. Next time I make this I am going to try omitting the water.

I had to change a little since I did not have polish sausage I used Pork sausage and fried it up like you would do Hamburger added to all your ingredients then added a whole onion chopped and 3 minced garlic cloves and 1/3 red bell pepper. Instead of beef broth again I supplemented with Chicken broth and only 2 cups of water

Awesome recipe that everyone in my family of five loves and so easy to make. I added more carrots and celery and some onion and garlic.  I substituted the kielbasa for turkey kielbasa and tex-mex diced tomatoes for the plain diced tomatoes.

This is the first time I have ever eaten lentils and they are really good!  I did add a little parmesan and salsa to my bowl to add some flavor and I also used rotel as other people did! A great healthy soup!

Quite good and super easy!  I took others' suggestions and added the sausage and tomatoes only for the last hour.  I also added some chopped onion to begin with.  A little salt at the end was all it needed.  Too many spices overpower the sausage.  It tastes better to leave the lentils more subtle and let the sausage be the strong flavor.  Will definitely make again!

It's going to sound crazy, but my family doesn't really love kielbasa or brats, so I just used ground sausage.  I browned it in the skillet and added it to the lentils like you would add ground beef to chili.  It was still awesome!  Great recipe!

I left out the celery because I didn't have any and used chicken broth instead of beef.  I also used turkey sausage and added in 2 garlic cloves and about 1/2 c diced onions.  I cooked it on low for 7 hours and then added a can of Rotel for the last 30 minutes.  It was pretty good.  Will make again.

Wow so much flavour. SLow cooking is the way to go with this kind of dish. It was a great meal for my house full of hungry hockey fans. I followed another reviewers tip about adding acidic foods like tomatos during the last half an hour and every thing ended up great. Served it with some crusty bread and lots of beer.....it was a hit.

This was really good!! I used the other reviews suggestions and added a can of tomatoes with green chilies, for a kick, also added a whole onion chopped. This had the perfect spices to it! also added some garlic salt! This makes a lot of stew so I am able to freeze half of it and give some to my parents. This is really filling! I served this over some hot cornbread and wow! So amazing! I used a 16 oz bag of brown lentils that it called for but man there was a bunch of lentils! I might use only half next time!

Love it! I did replace the water with more broth. I also doubled the carrots and celery and added a large onion in chunks, and 2 tsp of minced garlic. Instead of kielbasa, I used Spanish Chorizo. I used small brown lentils, and cooked it on low for 7 hours.  Turned out great, all my picky boys loved it! You have got to try it! YUMMY!

This was a tremendous disappointment. Virtually inedible.  The lentils were not fully cooked even after 7 hours in the crock pot.  And the taste was very blah. Will not make it again.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I left out the celery b/c I didn't have any and added garlic powder and kosher salt.  This was my first time cooking with lentils and I was pleased with this recipe.  Something weird, my sausage turned purple!

This is fantastic.  I make two changes; I don't drain the tomatoes, and I add a bay leaf or two.  It tastes great with some Grade B maple syrup over the top when you serve it.

I've made this several times changing it with whatever I have on hand.  I made a vegan version today!  I used one package of Trader Joe's meatless meatballs instead of the sausage.  I microwave them about one minute to make them soft enough to cut in half and then put them in with everything else. I used vegetable broth instead of beef.  The meatballs have so much flavor it didn't seem to matter. I used canned tomatoes and carrots but didn't drain them as I usually don't have enough liquid. Very easy!

This wasn't me or my husbands cup of tea but my toddler loved it (I made it really for him because he loves lentils).  I used green lentils and pork sausagemeat (which I browned before I added it to the crock pot) as polish sausage is hard to come by in my neck of the woods.  Not enough veggies I thought either.  I will be making this for my toddler again but I will scale down the recipe, use more veggies and will use split red lentils instead of green lentils - they just taste nicer, cook quicker and work better in casserole type recipes.

I made this using Puy (French green) lentils, which really hold their shape and do not turn mushy.  I followed the recipe fairly closely but I didn't have any kielbasa on hand so I used up some vegetables I had hanging round - eggplant and zucchini cut into large chunks, lots of garlic, and a couple of teaspoons of Cajun jerk seasoning.  I wound up cooking the lentils longer (the salt actually slows down the softening process).  It was pretty good on the first night, but the leftovers were much better on the second and third day.  Like chili, I think this dish really benefits from 24 hours in the fridge.  I reheated on the stove the next evening with the kielbasa in and it was excellent.  I had enough left over for lunch and my work colleagues all agreed that it smelled delicious.  I will definitely make this again, though I may try it with chorizo, red wine, thyme and bay leaves instead of kielbasa and Cajun seasoning.

Was very good but the lentils could have cooked a little more. I cooked them for 7 hours on low. My husband, however, loved it. Will make again but cook the lentils longer

I added onions and garlic like some of other people suggested but could only fit half the kielbasa called for in my slow cooker. Even with only half, it still made it very greasy.  Would've been better w/ crusty bread on the side. Taste was just ok but it was very filling and very cheap.

This recipe is very simple, yet OUTSTANDING!  This has become a recipe that I never get tired of.  I have used lower fat turkey ham to save on some of the fat and it has come out just fine.  Try this recipe--you will NOT be disappointed.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I did add fresh garlic and some onion to spice it up a bit, but overall it was a quick and tasty dish.  It will be made quite frequently in our home.

Used a lean jalapeño sausage instead of kielbasa.  Also used green lentils.  Added a can of Rotel as well as diced tomatoes.  I liked it very much as did my wife (though she didn’t like the sausage).  Would try again with French green lentils  and a different sausage.

My husband, who claims not to like stews or soups much, still tells people about this recipe  and I have not made it in nearly 2 years now. I also took some of this to a sick neighbor and her husband and they  liked it as well. Needless to say then this recipe is a keeper, and now that fall is here I am going to make this again.

My family enjoyed this soup -- especially my husband.  I had all of the ingredients on hand except the beef broth.  I just used the equivalent amount of water and three beef bouillon cubes.  I only added pepper and a few dashes of liquid smoke.  After cooking on high for 3-1/2 hours, it wasn't done -- took closer to five hours. I served it with garlic bread.  It was very simple to make, tasty and filling.  Will definitely have it again.

I used turkey kielbasa, added a chopped onion, minced onion along with the rest of the ingredients. I heeded others advice about adding the tomatoes in after the lentils were almost done, so a can of mild Rotel was added at the 5 hour mark. Twenty minutes later we had dinner! My husband really liked it, I thought it was good, at least something different than we usually do. Will keep making!

I used this recipe as a baseline, but added an onion, garlic, and more carrots.  I accidentally oversalted it during the prep phase, so I would recommend not salting it until you taste the finished product.   This was a great first crockpot / slow cooker recipe.  Would definitely try this recipe again.

I have made this one several times...a real keeper; so easy to toss together, and it's just warm and hearty. I've used whatever cans of tomatoes I have on hand, as well as Rotel. It's just SO GOOD, no matter what you dump in. Use your creativity. Maybe this summer I'll go wild and use tomatoes from the garden!

Made this today and it's very flavorful. I thought two lbs. of sausage a bit much, and just used one. So easy to put together...I actually, almost literally, threw it together right before I ran out the door for work this afternoon. Didn't have celery and no time to cut up carrot so it went without; I added a smidgen of celery seed and garlic powder. Will definitely make again! Thanks, sorsha24!

I've never been able to get my lentils to soften. Finally read other sites that said hard water and acidity (i.e. tomoatoes) can affect the cooking. After 3 hrs & still crunchy lentils, I dissolved 1/2 tsp of baking soda in a bit of water & threw it in the pot. Then put it on low for another 30 mins. FINALLY! YUMMY, COOKED, SOFT LENTILS! But they cooked FAST in that extra 30 mins. Not sure what will happen if I put it in from the get-go though.

Excellent!  When I was an exchange student in Spain, my host-mom made a similar dish all the time.  I did add an onion, lots of extra carrots, 1 tsp of cumin, and pepper.  I just used one package of the "ring sausage" you can find in the meat section of the grocery store.  Super easy, super cheap, super good.  My 22-month-old loved it.

This was really good. Used small brown lentils, added onion and garlic and only used one pound of the sausage that was the chicken hardwood smoked kind by Hillshire Farm. I also did not drain the tomatoes. It cooked for almost 11 hours on low and was perfect; the lentils held their shape but were cooked through.

Delicious! I made this with chicken broth and turkey kielbasa and mushrooms, but used the measurements. We have enjoyed it all week and have a few servings to freeze for easy dinners. Great for packed lunch, too!

Delicious! Like others I made a few adjustments: added onion, a can of rotel, and some spices like Cajun seasoning. I also doubled the amount of carrots and celery. My husband, who claimed he didn't like lentils, had three helpings!

Amazing!! made it last night and a BIG hit! I omitted the tomatoes, and added more spices to it. It was delish! I cooked it on low for 6 hours in the crock pot. I did need more water half way through, maybe because I didn't use the beef broth? Either way it came out great. Highly Recommend!

I changed a few things- used sirloin tip, added 3 stalks celery, 3 chopped carrots, half a red onion, and various spices. Next time- remember to add garlic, and some hot sauce. Added tomatoes with 2 hours left to cook, took 6 hours total on high (slow cooker)

Yummy.  This is also a good way to use up that summer sausage that you aren't sure what to do with.  Also (as someone else mentioned) add the tomatoes once the lentils are done otherwise they don't cook right.  I also always remove the strings from my celery for a nicer texture.

This is a very bland recipe. The abundance of sausage and the Campbell's (low salt) beef broth makes the dish very salty.  I added garlic and onion and doubled the vegetables, but the dish tastes like salted smoky lentils. This might be good for people who enjoy canned pork and beans.

Good! I cut the lentils and sausage in half and tripled the carrots and celery. Also added a can of mushrooms and plenty of seasonings (crushed red pepper, basil, oregano, bay leaves, garlic). Thanks! :)

I made this recipe using Turkey sausage instead of Polish sausage, in an attempt to make it a little healthier. It turned out pretty well. Instead of cooking the sausage in the crock pot, I pan seared it with onions in a skillet and added it to the mix at the end. I definitely added some extra seasonings and onion to give it more flavor. Overall, it turned out pretty yummy. It made a huge amount though, so unfortunately we will probably get sick of it by having so much leftover.

Very delicious!  Because everyone else said it needed a little something due to lack of spices, I added a diced jalapeño. I guess that did the trick, because I think it's perfect!

This did not turn out well at all. I couldn't stand the taste of it, to be honest, although my boyfriend seemed to like it. I had to cut back on the water, because my crock pot was almost to the top as it was. So therefore the lentils came out hard and not soft. It basically had no flavour (and I even added my own seasonsing!). Probably will not make again.

Found this to be a bit bland and boring. Added a little curry powder & chilli to spice it up a bit. Had no problems with the lentils cooking through.

This recipe is THE BEST per my husband's rating scale - says he could eat this 3 times a day.
We use whatever variety of sausage we're in the mood for - each adds its own flavor.  We also add a little garlic or garlic powder.  Excellent and Easy!!

I thought it was very good but I made some changes.  I sauteed onions and garlic before putting them in the crockpot.  I also used chicken stock that I had in the freezer which already had some latin spices in it.  Finally, I used Spanich Chorizo in place of polish sausage.  It was a hit!

Great recipe, but be sure to set the temperature on your cooker high enough to keep the liquid slightly boiling (my cooker doesn't have low and high but temp settings). 

Even though this cooked for 10 hours while I was at work, lentils still were not completely cooked. Bringing things up to a rolling boil for about 30 minutes finished things off nicely, though.

Family loved this dish, perfect for days when it's a little cold out. Will definitely be putting this into regular rotation.

It was delicious.  I doubled up on the sausage and broth (subtracting an equal amount of water).  I also added a tablespoon of honey to sweeten up the tomatoes since they can taste a little bitter.  I also added a couple of splashes of hot sauce

Very flavorful and satisfying.  I really enjoyed.  Unfortunately the rest of the family was put off by the typical cooked lentil "grey glop" look and wouldn't even taste it.  (They're only 5-9)
I'll make it again, if only for myself ;0)

I used gross tasting sausage so, blah.  Took a few hours on high.

Changes:  4 c lentils, 1 can tomato paste, 2 cubes beef broth, 8 c water, 2 carots, 1 cup sausage, 2 celery, added 1 tbsp red pepper, cilantro.  Forgot to add 1 tsp salt.

I think I must not be a "lentil person."  I had this one night with hubby kids and brother and sister in law.  Brother in law really raved--said it tasted just like a lentil soup he gets at Carrabas. Hubby liked it---but he likes anything.  Sis in law liked it---but was she being polite???  Kids only ate the sausge out of it.  As for me...not my cup of tea, but I think the recipe was a good one and very solid.  I'm just not a lentil person, I guess.

I wish I liked this more...the lentils came out very "starchy".  I did rinse them well, it was just way too thick for me. My husband liked it, however.  I did add 3 chopped carrots instead of 1 and 2 large chopped celery stalks instead of 1, just for some variety.  I don't know if I will make it again.  If I do, I'll cut the lentils down and just use 3/4 of a lb.

I made a couple of changes to the original recipe.  I used turkey kielbasa and added one small onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  I also used 3 carrots and 3 staks of celery instead of just one of each.  I had to cook it an extra 2 hours since the lentils weren't quite done but that's OK with me because it would have been done much too early otherwise.  I thought it was OK but a tad bit lacking the first night although it was alot better as leftovers.  My friend and her 3 year old really old liked it, although my 3 year old was less than excited.  I'll try it again but I'd like to add one more carrot and another can of tomatoes (can't have too many veggies in my opinion).  I'll also add couple more cloves of garlic and a bay leaf for flavor.  Thyme might be a nice addition, as well.

Considering this recipe was my first attempt at making lentils, the experience was just ok. I probably wouldn't make the recipe again. Maybe I've discovered I just don't like lentils.

I made this for my husband, who gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. I modified the recipe slightly. I added onion and I browned that up with the sausage before adding to the crockpot. I didn't actually try the soup myself (I don't like lentils) but I have to say it smelled terrific as it cooked!

With the extra spices such as cumin , Adobo, and pepper (as well as the onion, garlic and more carrots), it turned out to be very savory and nice!  My friend described it as "hearty and flavorful" and it was wonderful to wake up to the aroma. I would definitely make it again, especially since it scored me some points with my friend. ;-)

This was really yummy but I admit I was one of the minority. You do have to like lentils, which I do, but my family really doesn't.  It's very very easy to prepare.  I substituted 2 cans of condensed beef broth and added another cup of water to the recipe.  It turned out great!

This was very good.  I added some cayanne pepper and cajun seasoning for taste.  It tasted similar to spilt pea soup.

This was DELICIOUS!  I used Butterball brand Turkey Polish Kielbasa and Turkey Polish Sausage and it was sensational!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added the tomatoes toward the end so my lentils would be soft.  Plenty of flavor, although I added some celery seed, pepper and salt while cooking.  I loved it and will happily serve it to company with salad and crusty bread!

This was not a stand-out.  I made it with less liquid because we prefer thick stews.  It tasted fine, but looked very unappealing.  My husband thought the lentils made for an odd combination with the sausage.  All in all it was okay, but not something I would make again.

Loved it!!  I cut the recipe in half (I only cook for 2) and added an extra can of tomatoes.  I also added some chopped garlic and onion powder for some extra flavor.  Didn't need much more!  It was even good the next day!!

I like lentils but not sausage.  My husband likes sausage but not lentils.  My daughter hadn't been introduced to lentils before but likes sausage.  I thought if we all went in open-minded, this dish might unite our different tastes.  We did, but it didn't.  Hubby liked it okay, me a little less than okay, and our daughter spit it out and made do with salad.  I didn't get the feeling that the recipe was constructed or written poorly, just not to our palates.  Thanks anyway.

Not pretty, but tastes great. 12 year old son and 4 year old daughter loved it. Used Low fat turkey Kielbasa and Chicken Broth to Lower the fat. Cooked 8 hrs on low. Will definitely make again.

Yummy!  Has a surprisingly complex flavor for such a low-maintenance meal.  Try using Italian style diced tomatoes.

I used low-fat kielbasa and fat free chicken broth, along with two cloves of garlic and it was wonderful!  I also cooked it for almost 10 hours on low, which seemed to reduce the wateriness and tough lentils that other people experienced.

My only problem with this recipe was the lentils. They were still a little on the crunchy side after 5 hours in my crockpot on high. Other than that, the flavor was excellent, so next time I think I'll just leave it cooking a little longer.

Didn't have much flavor and was kinda one big pile of mush when it was done. I'll try it again and add a few more spices and add the lentils later.
