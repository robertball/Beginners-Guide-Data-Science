This is perfect for a chilly night and a movie.  It's great as is, but I prefer heartier and spicy meals, so I add sliced carrots, mushrooms, diced onion and seasonings (sea salt, black pepper, basil and dried Mexico Chile pepper).

Easy, economical, and delicious.  I used a 13 ounce bag of frozen tortellini(plus an extra cup of water), a can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh, and 10 ounces of fresh spinach roughly chopped.  Big, big hit.

Love this soup! Easy to make and healthy! This is my boyfriends favorite soup now, and he asks me to make it all the time. I used canned petite diced tomatoes and it still comes out great. I also use a different sausage...an italian turkey sausage that doesn't have fennel seeds, since 'ive never liked them. i also remove the casings from the sausage before cooking, since i found they tend to fall off in the soup. i don't add anything extra, since all of these flavors just work so well together!

This was awesome. The only things I did different was use my favorite sausage, (HEB brand chicken, spinach and feta cheese) and I added some red pepper flakes. This was so good. Thanks for sharing.

Just made this dish tonight and it was delicious! My husband loved it. I will definitely be making this dish again. I made one small revision by adding some fresh green onion.

Excellent!!  I made this on Christmas Eve to be served on Christmas Day.  I prepared it except for adding and cooking the tortellini, this allowed the flavors to marry and develop. Before serving I added and cooked the tortellini. I made as directed except for a few minor changes: used 7 oz canned petite diced tomatoes, drained - chicken sausage with mozzarella, peppers and sun dried tomatoes - and 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning. I also cut the garlic down to 2 very large cloves.  Numerous people said the broth was fabulous with great depth of flavor!  I tried making again tonight but did not have tomatoes so used 6 oz roasted red sweet peppers diced.  It was very good, but I think it will be even better tomorrow after broth rests overnight, that is "key" to developed depth of flavor.

This was amazing. My children loved it. I had to use regular italian sausage because thats all I could find, However, I know the chicken or turkey kind taste just as good to me. I left out the wine because my kids don't like that flavor in cooking. Wish I could have used it though. I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes, and used a can of diced tomatoes instead. This is a keeper though. next time I hope i can find the turkey italian sausage.

So fast! So Easy!  Add crust bread and your set.  I only cook the tortellini for 3 min before adding the other ingredients.  I like mine al dente.

This soup was awesome.  I didn't have the sweet sausage, so I used turkey kielbasa instead and it turned out great.  We loved the depth of flavor that the wine added.  The soup tasted even better the next day, I think the flavors melded together even more.  Will definitely make again!!

This is REALLY good! I forgot to add the tomatoes but I don't think it affected the recipe at all. I used Pinot for my white wine. I will definitely be making this again.

So simple and yet so delicious!  This was quick and easy to put together for a weeknight meal - yet it tastes like you slaved for hours.  You'd never suspect that the sausage was low fat because it's full of flavor.  All I added was a garden salad and warm crusty bread - perfect with a glass of wine to complete this meal!

Used recipe exactly but wound up adding an additional 2 cups of broth as the tortellini absorbed much of the initial broth and left it not-so-soupy. Excellent recipe!

This soup is fantastic! I did change a few small things, but not enough to make it a new recipe. I only used half of the tortellini called for and replaced the other half with chopped red onions and thinly sliced sweet mini peppers. I also used rainbow Swiss chard out of my garden instead of baby spinach just to utilize what I had on hand. I added a nice pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and this is a nice, light supper for 4. For the white wine, I used a 2007 Californian Sauvignon Blanc. I have nothing but high praises for this recipe. Thanks, al fresco for submitting it! YUM!

I LOVED this!!! I added some salt and pepper afterwards for a little extra flavor but it tasted good without! My kids even liked this. I also got herb chicken torellinis instead of cheese torellinis and I used Spinach mozerella sausage instead. It was great!

I was disappointed in the spices in this recipe.  I expected more of an Italian flavor.  But it was fine otherwise, and good leftovers - I made half the recipe and it was plenty for my husband and toddler, and we had leftovers.

Very good! Nice flavors, nothing overpowering.. though I did cut the garlic down to 2 big cloves. I forgot to add the butter before serving, but it was still really tasty. Served with a crusty Italian bread. Yum. Thanks :)

Yummy flavor! I couldn't find cheese tortellini without spinach so I used ravioli. We do not like spinach so I omitted it in all forms.

It was excellent! Having said that, I had converstated with a few others before making this and took in to the suggestion others stated there was too much tortellini in the recipe. I in mind was going to use the 9oz package I bought and not to use the 19oz that I bought that was frozen. Well, I ended up using the 19oz by mistake(because I got distracted) And saw what others saw. Too much and not enough of the yummy yummy broth this recipe made. SO I did follow to a T, and after seeing I didn't have enough broth. I measured out an additional 1/4 cup of white wine & 21oz of chicken broth. And that was it. I didn't feel it needed any spices. We loved it the way it is written with and additional amount liquids. I'll make again because I got my husband to eat spinach. TY

This left us feeling warm and satisfied.  I folled the recipe exactly, except I left out the butter at the end and added some ground pepper, majoram, and basil.  I'll definitely be adding this to the regular rotation!  :)

This is pretty tasty given the minimal effort that goes into it--definitely one of my "lazy" meal standbys. A bit of grated parmesan on top goes a long way. This also tastes great with homemade or even jarred pasta sauce in place of the chicken broth!

This dish was really delicious.  I made it after skiing and it was perfect to warm up my cold bones.  It was really easy to make- the sausage was fantastic.  I used the fresh contadina four cheese tortellini.  I just added some crusty bread and voila a really quick, delicious meal that was low fat too.  What more could you ask?!

We loved this soup. It was SO very simple but so tasty! I had used 2 of the 4 sausages that come in the package for another recipe so I only used the 2 I had left, 9 oz of tortellini, a can of petite diced tomatoes (with green chiles) and probably more spinach because I love it, I didn't measure the spinach just added until it looked good to me. Everything else I left the same. I served the soup with buttered slices of french baguette. Great for a cold, snowy or rainy night. Thanks!

I loved the way this soup was light, yet hearty. I didn't have tortellini on hand so I used gnocchi. This was quick, colorful, and keeps well for a quick reheated lunch the next day!

We liked the soup but giving it four stars because if you add all the tortellini (18oz) that is calls for it won't be soup as all the liquid is absorbed by all that pasta.  I had to add 2 cups of broth but next time I would only use half the tortellini.

This is tough for me to rate because I don't like sausage (not Al Fresco, I just don't care for ANY sausage).  Regardless, I very much enjoyed the soup.  Would I make it again?  Perhaps, just w/a substitution for the sausage!   This is def worth making if you like sausage (for those of you wondering why I would make this if I don't like sausage, it was an All Star assignment).

Such a yummy soup! The Al Fresco Chicken sausage is so good! I followed this recipe to a tee. I think it could have benefited from a little more broth but otherwise it was perfect! Quick and easy! Love it!

I had opened boxes of chicken and beef broth in the fridge, so I used a combination of the two.  The pkg of tortellini was 20 oz, so I used the entire package and then added a bit more chicken broth. Served with some grated Romano cheese on the top.  Very nice, easy, and full of flavor.

I literally just finished eating this soup.  It is amazing!  I used 2 bottles of Weinhard beer and Better Than Chicken jarred stock and some water.  Also used up the last of the garden tomatoes that miraculously ripened in the house.  Next time I'll use canned tomatoes.

I also added Italian herbs as suggested in some of the other reviews and of course my secret ingredient, Bragg's Amino Acids...a MUST for soup.

This is a beautiful recipe that is very adaptable!  Thanks for sharing!

We loved this recipe and it's in the regular rotation. Based upon household health and preferences, we choose to use lowfat sweet pepper italian chicken sausage Thin & Trim) and salt free chicken broth. This is a tasty and comforting soup... especially on cold rainy evenings.

Family really enjoyed this soup. Easy to put together and eye pleasing with all the colors. Sausage and Tortellini were very tasty together. Adding the butter gave it an almost creamy texture. Very good recipe.

I love how easy this was and it tasted like it simmered for hours! I sliced the sausages first, then I browned them in the pan. I also used about 64 oz of broth (2 cartons) and about a cup of white wine because there didn't seem to be enough liquid.  I didn't have to add any additional spices. I used whole wheat tortellini to make it healthier.

I prepared the recipe exactly as stated, except I removed the stems and gave the spinach a rough chop.  This had good flavor, it was very easy to assemble, and it is a solid recipe.  This is definitely one for a busy evening, when you need to put something warm and filling on the table in minutes.  If your family enjoys heat, then a few red pepper flakes might zip it up a little.

This was really good and a big hit on girls' night,  everyone wanted with recipe.  Ended up using canned chopped tomatoes with Italian seasoning becuase I forgot to buy fresh, and my chicken sausage was a three cheese blend but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Easy and delicious - can't get any better than that.

We enjoyed this very much.  I added extra chicken broth, spinach and tortellini.  I sliced sausage and then browned really well.  My husband who is not a tortellini fan really liked this soup.  He did mention I should use even more spinach next time.

My husband and I loved this soup.  The kids didn't care for it, and I think it may have been due to the wine.  Also, our store didn't carry the Italian al fresco sausage, so I substituted the garlic sausage which was a little overpowering, but we liked the soup nonetheless!

The fresh Chicken Sweet Italian Sausage was not available in my area so I used the precooked sausage and browned them in a little oil until heated through. I used whole wheat fresh tortellini and vegetable broth since I had some to use up. I love the simplicity of this recipe. So quick and easy and pretty tasty.

I should rate this 3* since I felt the need to make several changes to get it up to par, but the final outcome was 4.5.  I added onion to the garlic, and also added a small grated carrot.  I sliced the sausage before sauteing, added Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, sea salt, and freshly cracked black pepper.  I also felt it needed for chicken stock.  Just before serving, I topped with a little Parmesan and Romano cheeses.  My husband really enjoyed this, even though he didn't care for this same sausage in another dish. This is a great use for this sausage.  I would make this soup again.

Very good soup. I halved the recipe for just my husband and me which made me use 9 oz. of the tortellini.  I used a 12 oz. package of Johnsonville apple flavored sausages, though, because my area doesn't carry Al Fresco. I did not agree with many others that there wasn't enough broth for the noodles.  I thought it was perfect! Maybe because there was more meat in it to balance things out.

This is super fast to prepare - I do have a slight change - slice the sausage on the diagonal and THEN to a quick saute - much faster that way.  I added in a small amount of italian seasoning, but otherwise no changes.  This would also be good w/ cannellini beans added into it!

I was surprised how delicious this soup was. It had a light, fresh taste. My whole family enjoyed it. It was quick and easy to make, which is always a plus. I'll definitely make this again.

This was VERY good! I couldn't find the 16 oz. package of sausage. The store only sold 12 oz. packs. The only change I made was to saute the sausage in the garlic because I heard that these sausage had a strong fennel flavor...I'm not a fan of fennel! The fennel wasn't too strong for me at all! I also added 1 tsp. of salt to the soup and garnished it with shredded provolone cheese for some extra flavor...YUM!!! We loved this recipe!

I read the list of ingredients on the package of al fresco(R) All Natural Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage so it was no surprise to me that there was fennel.  What surprised me was the amount of fennel that could be tasted.  Hopefully, this was a fluke and not all of the pkgs have as much as mine did.  Thanks al fresco for the free coupon!

This was delicious! I sauteed some onion w/ the garlic and used a can of diced tomatoes (w/ the juice) in place of the fresh tomatoes, which are not very good right now. Loved the flavor the white wine gave to this. Very simple to prepare. I will be making this again! Thank for sharing. :)

Simple, easy, and delicious. You could add a million wonderful veggies to this if you wanted, or make exactly as writted. I did not use the full amount of sausage indicated, and was more than happy with the soup. I also diced a bit of zucchini and sauteed to add. Thanks for the quick recipe!

We thought this was quite good. I do think as written it needs a little something. I used canned diced tomatoes with green chilis which added a nice kick and simmered longer to let the favors marry. I did have to use a different brand of Italian Chicken Sausage, as Al Fresco is not available in my area.

Hubby declared this an absolute keeper.  I used spicy sausage just because we prefer a little kick.  And I added some chopped carrots and half an onion.  I used spinach tortellini.

I had to make some minor adjustments for what I had. I used pork Italian sausage, frozen spinach, diced tomatoes with basil  and garlic. I had an open bottle of Moscato in the fridge so I used that for the wine. Oh, I almost forgot...I didn't  have any chincken broth. I substituted with water and sazon seasoning. My kids LOOOOVED it!!! will make again!

This is a family favorite! I use mild Italian sausage and double the chicken broth because
our family believes that more broth makes it soup and less broth makes it a stew. I chop
the spinach up so that it doesn't become "stringy" trying to pick it up  with your spoon.

We used a box of frozen creamed spinach in a pinch and it was still great!  Easy to make, and tastes delicious.  The only seasoning it needed was a pinch of sea salt.

This was good and relatively easy to make. I accidentally got the low sodium chicken broth so it was a little bland. Next time I will be sure to buy the normal chicken broth!

5 stars for ease  and flavor.  Husband and kids all loved it.  Of course being last minute, I had to substitute with what I had which was canned tomatoes instead of fresh, gnocchi instead of tortellini, and red wine instead of white.  I also added in a few handfuls of chopped chanterelles and half an onion before I sauteed the garlic and dropped in some leftover corn cut off the cob and thyme at the end.  It would have been delicious just as written, but was a perfect base for using up my leftovers, too.  Got it on the table in 20 minutes.

This is a family favorite.  Minor modifications to the recipe added sliced carrots, used double the spinach, used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh and removed the sausage out of the casings and crumbled.  Just delicious.  I have also made this soup using left over italian sausage from game night and it was still delicious.

This was delicious!  I made it using the Jalapeno flavor instead of Sweet Italian flavor.  Grumpy was sick with a cold so I thought the heat from the sausage would work well for him.  I also used a semi sweet white wine - the kind I like to drink and I feel that made it perfect!  (I buy Brianna from Coyote Vineyards in Clayton, NY).  I omitted the extra butter, I felt we didn't need it.  This will definitely be on my table again!

I have a bad cold, and decided to make some soup to help me feel better...even tho it was 95 degrees today.LOL
  I only had one pkg of Al Fresco sausage and it was the tomato & basil meatballs. I used those in this soup and it was a very good sub. I cut them up, browned them first, set aside and made the soup. I used kale instead of spinach, since that is what I had. My family all loved it..with the exception of my grandson..He liked it all but the kale....which he kept calling "that seaweed stuff" hahaha. I served it with Skillet Zucchini Cornbread from AR. That was very good too.

This was really good.  We couldn't find Sweet Italian sausage, so we used the Chipotle, which ended up being too spicy for me (I'm a spice wimp, my husband LOVED it).  The only change we made was that we made a white wine slurry with just about 1 1/2 Tablespoon of white wine vinegar and a teaspoon of sugar to about 1/2 cup chicken broth.  No alcohol in our house.  We felt that the broth ended up too salty, but that's probably becuase of the broth we used.  I love wilted spinach in soup, so this was delish!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I changed tortellini for small shaped pasta and I swapped spinach (I don't like leafy greens in my soup) and added a can of white beans.  The main focus was the sausage which I really enjoyed!  My daughter's taking the leftovers to school for lunch tomorrow!!

This soup is so delicious! I was skeptical, thinking it would be bland with basically no seasoning in the broth. I expected to have to add some herbs, salt, something....but I was wrong. The al fresco sausage  was so flavorful that once I added it back in and let is simmer a bit the flavor was excellent.  Red wine went into this soup since I had no white wine on hand. I did add fresh ground pepper and some grated fresh Pecorino cheese to serve. We all enjoyed this soup!

This was a huge hit in our home! The broth was so flavorful and the sausage and tortelinni were the perfect balance. I took other reviewer's suggestions and increased the broth a bit and it was delicious! This is a recipe that I will make often! Thanks, Al Fresco for making such an incredible chicken sausage!

This soup was very good.  Although, I did need to add some seasonings.  I also was not able to get al fresco unless I drove 50 miles, so I used Aidella's which was a little greasy compared to what I have heard about al fresco brand.  I also added more spinach when I reheated.

We loved this recipe! Thank you Al Fresco!  I did have to make some changes though. I didn't feel like there was enough broth for the amount of noodles, so I chose to double the broth (I used chicken base and water as I didn't have any homemade broth on hand). I used Sake for the wine as that is what I had open, and I have to say it was very nice! The flavor of the broth was so good!

This was an extremely easy and flavorful dish.  I used the Al Fresco cooked Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage in this recipe and it had a great flavor.  I used canned tomatoes and chilies instead of fresh tomatoes since I had that on hand.  It was a very quick easy and flavorful dish.  Next time I will probably add a little italian seasoning as I like bold flavors and spices.

Delicious, just added a pinch of salt and pepper, basil, and red pepper flakes. The chicken sausage had more kick than I anticipated, but we love our spice in our house. Will make again, great as is!!!

So simple and delicious! It's important to get good quality chicken sausage, though. That can really impact the end result of the soup. I've made this 3X, already, this year!

Would have been fine on its own with some Italian seasoning added but I also Sautéed one small onion with the ground sweet sausage. Used one carton of chicken broth, large can of diced tomatoes and a can of white beans and puréed it after removing sausage.  Didn’t use white wine. Probably doubled spinach amount. No butter at end. Kids liked it especially since there weren’t chunks of tomatoes and obvious beans in it!

Great soup! I will be making this again. I did substitute Swiss chard for the spinach just because I had it in my garden.

Simple and delicious! I can't believe how flavorful it is without even adding salt and pepper. The chicken broth, garlic and sausage spiced it up perfectly and the tortellinis (mine wee stuffed with spinach and mozzarella from Costco) mellowed it out. Lovely soup! Thanks.

Turned out amazing! I used canned diced tomatoes that had garlic and olive oil in them. Plus I sautéed the sausage and jar garlic together. So yummy!

Good recipe.  Really enjoyed it.  I don't believe in rating a recipe that I've made changes to so I give it 4 stars based on the recipe as written....actually 3.5 stars if I could.

The second time I made this soup I made the following changes (now it's a 5-star recipe) and my husband and I both LOVED it!  To make it healthier I used olive oil cooking spray instead of olive oil and omitted the butter altogether as it really wasn't necessary.  Just for convenience I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, then added 1/2 tsp of salt and a dash of red pepper flakes to give it a little punch...the fresh chicken sausage I used from Shoprite was good but was somewhat bland.  In the future I'll probably do a combination of sweet and hot chicken sausage. I didn't do it this time, but next time I'll switch out the baby spinach for kale.  There's something about spinach that dries out my mouth (I know, weird).  I don't think the kale would make the recipe any more or less delicious, just a personal choice.  I really like soup during the cool months and this is now one of our favorites.  SO glad I came across it on the site.  Try it!!!

This was fairly simple and good.  I used chicken stock, some red pepper and mozzarella chicken sausage, and a can of tomatoes.

Really really good! I made a few small changes but I think it made it better.  I used my favorite Sweet Italian pork sausage, omitted the wine, butter, and added half an onion which I sautéed with the garlic.  Amazing!  I will make this again.

This was a good soup that was really easy to make.  I also did not have any fresh tomatoes so I used a large can of diced.  I also added more chicken broth and white wine since I like more of a broth.  Bought some sourdough bread to go along with it and topped with some romano cheese.  Definitely a quick and easy dinner that my husband and I enjoyed.

Very hearty and filling soup.  I couldn't find the brand of chicken sausage I was looking (I had a coupon) so I subbed smoked sausage (lite) instead. Also was out of white wine so I just subbed chicken broth for it instead.  I used a tri-color tortellini (the soup looked just too white and gray) that was filled with a mixtures of about three-four different cheeses.  Also instead of fresh tomatoes I used canned petite diced tomatoes.  I didn't add anything else and my family loved it!  I served it with slices of french bread and parmesan cheese.  Recipes for me are "suggestions". Feel free to mix it up, make substitutions, additions, etc. for your personal tastes/preferences.  I'm definitely gonna add this to our dinner rotation.

My family really liked this soup, I did however have to use ground Italian sausage (that's what I had), and I didn't have white wine so I used more broth, and I used petite chopped canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  We sprinkled our bowls with parmesan cheese, it was delicious!

Pretty good over all, I used canned tomatoes with worked great. It was great the first day, but by the second day, the spinach was pretty limp and kind of gross.  I used fresh spinach when I made it, so that may have made a difference.

This soup was fabulous! I made this for a little get together at my place and everyone just loved it. People were complimenting the soup days later. Sooo good!
