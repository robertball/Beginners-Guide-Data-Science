Tasty! I've never had anything like this before, and I thought it turned out good. I did reduce the servings, so it didn't take near as long as stated to boil/thicken. Also, I did add extra salt and pepper b/c I felt it needed it. This was fun to try and different...I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used to eat this as a kid, it's still good. Portions are a little off. Even after halving it I still made too much.

Tasty and easy. I added ground chorizo. Gave it a good added kick.

So good and a great way to make a dent in the hard boiled egg after Easter cache!

We added sausage this time and the family devoured the pot!
