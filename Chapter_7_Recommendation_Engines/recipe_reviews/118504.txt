This is great recipe for the Crock Pot! I signed up for sweet potatoes for our company Thanksgiving lunch without considering how I would provide a hot dish to 40 people. But I found this recipe and thought it would easily convert to the slow cooker - it did! I quadrupled the recipe and probably added a LOT more butter (that can't be a bad thing, right?!). The dish got rave reviews - one of my coworkers nearly hugged me she loved it so much. I just followed the directions, but instead of baking it, I put it all in the slow cooker on high for 3 1/2 hours. Perfect!

This recipe sounded so good, but I had a couple of reservations about it.  The cranberries stay very tart, too much so for my tastes, and the potatoes turn out too soft by the time they are boiled and then baked.  Next time I would simmer them for a shorter time period.

I had made this recipe at Thanksgiving last year, and while everyone raved about it, I thought it was okay.  This year, I made it again, as so many people liked it, but made some modifications.  I bought fresh cranberries a couple of weeks ahead of time and froze them.  So, when the dish was ready to eat, the cranberries were softer, and seemed to be sweeter.  Also, since dinner was at my sister's house, I made it the night before, and assembled everything, so all we had to do was pop it in the oven.  I think the sitting overnight in the orange juice really helped to flavor it a bit more.  I loved it this year!  I also used pecans vs. the walnuts because I hate walnuts, and I ran them thru the food processor to chop them up pretty fine.  A great recipe, I just made some minor adjustments for my taste.

This is one of my favorite holiday recipes!  Usually I need the oven space so I make it in a crock pot.  I do not pre-cook the potatos.  I peel and slice the sweet potatos raw.  Then I layer potatos, cranberries, nuts, brown sugar, over and over until I fill the crock pot.  I do not make the topping separately.  I just add slices of butter and cinnamon to the top of the last layer, then add the OJ.  If you like yours very sweet, you can add honey or extra brown sugar.  Sometimes, I will do all of this the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight if I will be rushed for time the day of the dinner.  Cook for 3.5-4 hours on HIGH or 6-8 hours on LOW.  LOVE how easy this recipe is!

This is great.  The cranberries give a nice tartness and the dish is very pretty with the deep red of the berries contrasting with the potatoes.   I have always made mashed sweet potatoes with some orange juice, cinnamon, brown sugar, etc. for Thanksgiving and that has been a family favorite. This casserole is a delicious change and makes a more festive presentation. Thanks!
I thought I would add that I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit.

Perfect! I used the crockpot for 8 hrs on low. It freed up the stove and cooktop. I didn't measure a thing, but just kept layering until the crock was 3/4 full, then added the topping. With nothing precooked, it was almost too easy. I did add more butter than indicated, and added a little brandy,  and switched up pecans for the walnuts. Using the crockpot, I would say this recipe is nearly fool-proof.

I made this for my very first Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit.  I even loved the leftovers the following day.  I made it the day before except for the topping and final baking.  I did that part just before I took the turkey out of the oven.  While the turkey set and then was carved, the sweet potato cranberry bake finished baking so that everything got to the table at the same time. I loved this recipe!!

Made with pecans, otherwise followed to the letter. Doubled fine. I had to email the recipe to 3 people after Thanksgiving was over.

My friend always invites me over to their house for Thanksgiving but asks me to bring something healthy.  I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar - no one even noticed.  Also, since my friend did not have room in her oven, I used the slow cooker for 2 hours instead of baking it.  Turned out well!

This side dish was excellent.  I added rolled oats to the topping ingredients.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner, guests said it was more like a dessert than a dish.  Great change.

Very easy to make and very tasty!  Attractive presentation.  I had this recipe years ago but lost it.  This site is an excellent source for desired recipes.  I made this for Christmas dinner at my MIL's--everyone loved it.  Disappeared within minutes!  I did use well drained canned sweet potatoes due to time constraints.  Will make again!

This was so delicious! I was looking for a recipe that wasn't the traditional sweet potato casserole and this fit the bill. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for a great side dish. My whole family loved it.

What a great recipe.  I used peacans (pantry stock)instead of walnuts.  It came out beautifully, and was a big hit at our potluck at work yesterday.  Thank you Jill!

Loved it!  The combination of sweet and tart is really tasty.  I also added chunks of acorn squash, used OJ concentrate, cut back on the butter and sugar (used brown demerara sugar - gives it a bit of a crunch), fresh cranberries and steel cut oats in place of the nuts (nut allergy in the family).  It felt so good to be eating something so healthy and tasty at the same time!  I imagine its even all that much better with the nuts.  Will definitely make it again.

This was surprisingly delicious dish. I followed the recipe exactly (using fresh cranberries), and it turned out beautifully. Although, I think I should have boiled the sweet potatoes about 5 minutes less.  This is a fantastic dish to serve with coffee or tea at the end of hearty Autumn meal. I suggest doubling-to-tripling the topping, though, to cover the whole dish.

Made this for xmas 2011 and it was so delishious and healthy too with few good ingredients in it.  I loved the contrast between the sweet potatoes and tart, fresh cranberries.  It is great to pop into the oven while other items are baking for the meal.

The taste was very good but my casserole was full of liquid in the bottom - very soupy.  Maybe I boiled the potatoes too long.  I'm not sure.  But I would definitely make this again.  I just served it with a slotted spoon and everyone enjoyed it.

THE BEST EVER!  I loooooved this dish as did my family and friends.  I love sweet potatoes and don't like the typical mashed casserole types of dishes.  This was an excellent alternative!  The cranberries are a perfect blend of tartness to the sweetness of the other ingredients.  Will make over and over and over and over again!

A nice trist to the classic sweet potatoes w/ brown sugar and marshmallows. The cranberries added tartness to the sweet potatoes and accompanied the turkey nicely. I added a bit more butter and some maple syrup to the recipe to beef up the sauce a little bit. Yum!

Through the years, I have made many different sweet potato recipes, especially for the holidays. This recipe, is by far the best one yet!  It has the PERFECT balance...not too sweet like many sweet potato recipes, and just the right amount of tartness. The orange juice also lends a refreshing taste. The only thing I added to this recipe was a little orange zest.  This recipe will be part of my recipe collection!

I also made this in the crock pot. I partially cooked the potatoes in the microwave and I cut them into chunks rather than slices. I used dried cranberries because that is what I had on hand. Very easy and very good.

Love this recipe as a fresh, non-marshmallowed, sweet potato dish for the holidays. 
I substitute Splenda brown sugar, since I have Type 1 diabetes, and it's amazing. 
I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the tartness, but if you are into that kind of thing, like I am, you'll be coming back for seconds!

I substituted Splenda brown sugar baking mix (which is half Splenda and half brown sugar) and it turned out great.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions by freezing, then thawing the cranberries, and I assembled it all a day ahead.  My guests really enjoyed it, and were pleased that it wasn't one of those super-sweet dessert-like dishes.  This will now be my standard Thanksgiving sweet potato dish.

served this at Thanksgiving.  Everyone raved about it.  Personally I thought it was too sweet, but that could just be me.

This was a unique addition to our Christmas dinner and it was a hit. The flavors added a neat change to the usual sweet potato casserole people usually bring.  I wasn't able to use the walnuts due to family allergies to nuts, but it was still good.

I'm so sorry to say, as this is my first negative review, that this was just beautiful in appearance but not to the palate. This was almost tasteless and nary a comment from my large Christmas crowd. I'm glad others have had good experiences with this. However, it did not go over well with any of us here.

I served this at Thanksgiving. It was a lot of work, but everyone said that the combination of sweet potatoes and cranberries was a wonderful combination.  Also, this dish is not too sweet and dessert-like, as sweet potato dishes tend to be.

My family loved this recipe with our Christmas dinner. The tart cranberries were a nice compliment to the sweetness of the dish. A nice change of pace from the usual too sweet sidedishes containing sweet potatoes. It was a plus that it looked very pretty on the holiday table with the red cranberries.

Oh my - deeelish. I did the crock pot, simply because the ham was in the oven, not enough space. 3 1/2 hrs on high, 10 min. with the topping. REALLY GOOD. I think it would be better in the oven, as there was some juice & the topping didn't, of course, get browned. But it was still very good. My husband doesn't care for sweet potatoes & I don't care for cranberries & we both really enjoyed it. Even my picky toddler ate it up. It got raves all around - will definitely make again!

I made this exactly as it is written. I thought that this was very delicious and festive.  So different from the traditional, sugary, sweet potato goop that my husband prefers.  He liked it but prefers sugary goop.  I loved it and am writing the review so I can give it the rating.  If I have to cook sweet potatoes next time then this is what he is getting.  It's healthier for him.

This was a great side dish for Christmas dinner.  No leftovers and my Mom even asked me to make it for her birthday dinner 2 weeks later.  I forgot to add the OJ and it still turned out perfect!

This was a nice change from the usual candied sweet potatoes. The cranberries gave a nice balance to the sweetness of the sweet potatoes.
