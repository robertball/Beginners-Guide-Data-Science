The list of ingredients sounded like all  things we would like, but not processed together. Rather than using a food processor, I used a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and cheddar together and then gently stirred in the other ingredients.  Next time I would probably add a tablespoon of mayonnaise.  The crunch of the nuts and celery was great.  I did use turkey slices from the deli, cubed.   These wraps would be a great way to use up leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.

I left out the turkey and celery and replaced the cheddar with feta since I didn't want to run to the store.  They were amazing! I can't wait to share this recipe with my vegetarian daughter!
