I give this a four star cuz it’s easy to make... also I have never heard of Knorr rice so all I used was Uncle Bens white rice and seasoned it with president french butter, Mrs dash , and extra parsley . I also used two tablespoons of white wine and one table spoon of lime juice. Just remember to add salt to green beans and and shrimp to taste and your good . It’s a nice simple meal that takes no time and is easy to modify if you don’t want to go to store to buy what you don’t have. Oh and I used real butter through your this recipe and it turned out good

Very easy and elegant recipe fit for serving guests. I made a few changes: used angel hair pasta instead of rice, used Country Crock instead of butter (lactose intolerance), added olive oil at the end along with parsley. This made more of a sauce for the pasta. Next time plan to add white wine. Quite tasty and easy. Loved it.

I made the shrimp as called for bit left the rice mixture out. Then I put the shrimp over cilantro lime rice. Very good just not five star for lack of zest.

This is very fast to make, but it's missing something. It's good and I would make it again but maybe with some modifications. Perhaps adding white wine and a little bit of roasted red pepper to pop some color.
