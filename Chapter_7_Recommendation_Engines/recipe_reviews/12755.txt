The problem of the cakes falling apart can be remedied by  chilling them for a few hour or over night.  Then bake them, using less oil and saving calories.

They were extremely tasty, and fairly easy to make.  One thing--I had a difficult time getting them to stick together.

The flavor of these crab cakes was delightful.  Having said that, I found them a hassle to prepare and cook.  They seemed to fall apart the moment they were placed in the pan to fry.  However, I think if I had made smaller cakes, they would have worked out better.  I'm willing to make this again.  :)

I would have rated this 5 stars, but it needed a little spicing up.

These were okay, a little to hard to keep together, but overall a good treat

Didn't have a problem with them falling apart but, I think they'd be better with more spices and they weren't crunchy enough. I cooked them for quite a while but it seemed like they just wouldn't get done. bland flavor..it was missing something.
