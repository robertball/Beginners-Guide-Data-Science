This was not terrible, not great.  Decent flavor. I was looking forward to something a little more spicy.  Without the seeds, the jalapenos were not hot at all.  And since the Anaheim is never hot, it wasn't too spicy.  The cilantro gave it the most flavor in my opinion.  Served with a Southwestern dressing.

This is a great side to have with a Mexican dinner-- it lightens up all the meat, rice, & beans. I put a little Thousand Island dressing on it...spicy and delicious!

Wow! This is delicious! I followed the recipe to a "T" and I was not disappointed. To give it more "fire" I left the seeds in half of the jalapenos. For dressing, I used "Western Sweet & Smooth" which is made by Wish-Bone. I'll be making this again, well done James!
