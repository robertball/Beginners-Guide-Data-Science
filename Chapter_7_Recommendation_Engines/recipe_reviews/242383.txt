I had some help from my hubby with this one; as I am not usually the one that does the outdoors cooking. These were delicious. The rub had a wonderful flavor that was not too overpowering and the hoisin sauce gave  a little extra punch.

My family loved this recipe. Will definitely become a staple for our summer grilling.
