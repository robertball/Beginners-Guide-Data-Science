Having read the other reviews, I added a couple potatoes to the cauliflower. I boiled the potatoes separately and microwaved the Cauliflower.  I put the cauliflower in the processor and mashed well, then loosely mashed the potatoes separately adding butter, garlic, & sour cream.  Then I added the mashed cauliflower.  It was actually delicious.  My husband loves mashed potatoes and I don't think he would have known detected the difference if I hadn't told him.  Without the potatoes, I thought the mashed cauliflower texture was a little off-putting.  Since we don't really like the taste of cauliflower, I'm always looking for new ways to mask the taste because of the health benefits.  I will make this again.

I made this for my husband and he loved it. I added a pinch of black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder for a little kick. This was sooo easy to make! I will make it with different cheeses next time to experiment. Thank you for a great recipe!

I liked the taste and texture.  I may try to add garlic and onion powder to spiff up some tasting next time.

I make this all the time! My husband even prefers it to the Carb Loaded potatoes. I add a teaspoon of Brown Gravy Powder, 1/2 tsp Onion Powder and 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder to it for that real potato flavor

I liked this recipe for a quick, easy way to cook cauliflower and get to pretend I am eating mashed potatoes. This is less fattening and contains less cholesterol AND is very filling. I like the added garlic.

I wouldn't say that this recipe gives something that tastes like mashed potatoes, but it make delicious cauliflower!  I love goat cheese, and you can really taste it in this dish.  I saute 3 cloves of garlic in 2 tsp of butter and added that and it was really good.  Will make this again.

You don't need a head of fresh cauliflower. Frozen florets work fine. I don't use goat cheese, but fat-free (or low-fat) cream cheese instead. I also add a few herbs and minced onion when microwaving the cauliflower. We love it, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a true substitute for mashed potatoes.

I have made a version of this with cream cheese but I will have to try it with the goat cheese.  It will be a healthier alternative.

Ok, not amazing. Added some roasted garlic which helped a lot. Think adding a potato would help it as well! Going to try again with a few revisions.

I made this dish and my kids loved it. I looked it up because I wanted to get my one and two year old to eat this head of cauliflower. It was so easy to make and both my kids enjoyed it. I do believe that if I had just given it to them like normal they wouldn't have eaten it.

I liked this recipe very much. It was absolutely delicious. I had to restraint myself from eating more! I had it for dinner. The Cauliflower and the Goat Cheese is an amazing puree. But if I were looking to improve this recipe, I would maybe add a bit more flavour like Garlic to the Puree.

This was pretty good although no matter what you put in it there is really no substitute for mashed potatoes! The only thing I changed was I added two capfuls of half and half and some salt.

I steamed the Cauliflower and followed the recipe but added about 3/4 cup of cottage cheese with an herbal Goat ,cheese. I ,liked ,the texture ,most  definitely like mashed potatoes. Although it really tasted great it did still have a cabbage like odor.

The mashed cauliflower came out awesome. I added a little more cream cheese and a little more parmesan.  Although it was freshly steamed and went right into the food processor it had cooled down some. I had to pop it into the microwave for about 30 seconds.

Next time I'll use less cauliflower and cook it more? I did add some garlic, onion, and spice to help the flavor.  Not sure exactly what was wrong. Everyone ate it, but made no requests for a remake like the roasted cauliflower I made.
