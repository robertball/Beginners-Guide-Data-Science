I was looking for a quick blueberry dessert recipe and this one was definitely quick and easy.  Unfortunately, it was also bland and flavorless.  The consistency was gummy and it wasn't very sweet at all.  There are better recipes out there, for sure.

My company LOVES this recipe.  It is easy, fast and tastes like fresh berries. I like having a single crust for this pie

Oh my! Wonderful! I made this recipe exactly and also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I increased the cornstarch to about 4-5 TBSP as well. I topped my pie with crumble topping and it was absolutely fabulous!
TIP: If the dough is difficult to roll out, just place it in the pie dish and push it into the shape of the dish.

My brother in law introduced us to a version of this pie years ago and it has been a family favorite.  We often use frozen berries(using the drained liquid from thawing for the water) for the "sauce" and always fresh for the rest. I add way more blueberries so the pie is well mounded.  I adjust the cornstarch and sugar depending on how thick and/or sweet I need it. We don't add the butter.  I love the crust too!  I just press it in the pie pan, don't mess with rolling.

Great!  This was super easy to make, I only didn't use the crust recipe.  I love how in every bite, you get the cooked berries with the fresh berries.  This is an excellent summer dessert.

Easy as.... well, PIE, and super good too.  I put a bit too much cornstarch in, so it was a bit thick, I thought, but once it was in with the other berries it was fine.  Because I was trying to use some boysenberries and cascade berries (fresh from the garden!) I used them and blueberries, and it was perfect!

This was a good recipe to make for gluten-free people. (I bought the gluten-free crust from Whole Foods.) However, next time I will use much less or no sugar. The blueberries add enough of that.

This is the absolute best fresh blueberry pie recipe i have ever made.  I started with the recipe a decade ago and then I lost it. My original had a teaspoon of cinnamon, which I recommend including.  I have tried many others, and while some of them were pretty good, they were not this one.  It is easy, delicious and fast.  I have made it with home-made and refrigerator pie crusts and it always gets rave reviews.  Thanks so much for posting.

This is the blueberry pie recipe I’ve been making for 30 years, first published in the New York Times I believe. I got it from my sister in law, and now it’s the recipe my extended family has adopted. With the fresh berries, it is the best! (I do make a pate brisee butter crust for it.)

This pie was so delicious and easy to make that I am sure that I will be making it over and over  many times.  I molded the crust by hand into the pie pan rather than try to roll it out and had very good results that way..

I have made this recipe twice now. It is so simple and easy and it tastes soooo good! I did not make my own crust, because it is just too easy to buy them and bake a few minutes in the oven. But I followed the recipe exactly. I think you should try this if you are looking for a quick easy recipe that's has a minimum of ingredients and is quick!

I wasn't sure what to expect, what with mixing the fresh and the cooked blueberries, but this was delicious!  Almost too sweet.  Will probably use again when I get a craving.

The cooked blueberry mixture was way too thick. Will add more liquid to thin it out next time. Flavor of pie was still good and like the whole blueberry base.

I made this and I'll give it 4 stars. I didnt make the crust and used a pre-made rolled crust instead.  Next time I'll make my own crust.

Delicious; made it as the recipe is written.  
Next time, I will likely decrease the sugar in the cooked portion as I found it a bit too sweet.  Really good and will make it again.

This was an easy recipe. I liked the sweet cookie-like crust. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon per other reviewers recommendations. It went well with vanilla ice cream.

Wonderfully different than any blueberry pie I've ever tried, with the cooked and fresh blueberries.

I used sucralose for sugar, added a sprinkle of cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar free chocolate chips. Wonderful!

Not to hurt anyone's feelings, but did not like this at all.  Firstly, it is not sweet enough. The blueberry mixture is really gummy and the whole thing is strange. I was attracted to it because of having just 1 crust, but will never make this again.  I will say on the positive side that all those blueberries are, no doubt, healthy.

My husband said the best blueberry pie,  he had ever had. He loved the fresh and cooked berry combination. May could make more attractive by having a lattice pie crust on top.

I used 3 Tbsp of tapioca starch instead of cornstarch. The consistency got very gummy immediately after adding the starch, so I was unable to add butter or lemon juice before it solidified. The filling also turned out quite salty. Maybe should use kosher salt instead of iodized salt, or use a pinch of salt instead of 1/4 tsp as per the recipe.

I loved that this recipe didn't call for a store bought pie crust. I avoid them because of the hydrogenated oil (that they all have). I actually used olive oil in this crust because I was out of canola oil. I also put it into muffin tins and made little individual pies/tarts. They came out great.

Loved it.  So fresh and summery.  Added another cup and a half of berries and cut the sugar to half a cup.  The sauce was a little thick, so I just added a little water at a time as I boiled it.  Didn't add lemon or butter.  A family favorite.

The filling was fantastic! Nice and sweet, but not too sweet, thick. Whoever thought of putting fresh blueberries into the mix was a genius. The pie crust was good and had a great flavor. I truly enjoyed this strait out of the oven with a little vanilla ice cream. 

My only concern is that, while I love a thin pie crust as much as the next guy, it almost didn't reach the ends of the pan, which ended up being a little dark on the ends and thin. It was also very difficult to handle- very oily and crumbly. Eventually I just had to stop rolling it, crumble it up and push it into the pan myself. It was difficult. What saved it from loosing a star is it still ended up tasting great. 

Also, we were out of butter. So I replaced it with greek yogurt.

I was looking for a blueberry pie filling for a tart, and this was perfect.  I cut down the lemon juice to 1 tsp. and it was great!  Curious to see if this recipe would work with other fruits.

our family loves this pie!  i used the store bought roll-out crust to save time, and the filling just takes a few minutes, literally--couldn't be easier!
