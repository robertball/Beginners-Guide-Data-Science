This recipe was nasty.  The peanuts did not go well with the other ingrediants.  Keep peanuts away from this!

This was pretty good.  I did make add a few things to give it more flavor, but that's pretty normal for me.  We did more of an asian flare by creating a sauce/paste before rolling it in the crushed chicken.  We used soy sauce, Chinese hot mustard, hot chili sauce, etc. besides the garlic and other items.  It turned into a five star recipe once we added the other items.  We served cucumber peanut salad on the side, and it was a wonderful meal!  Thanks for the recipe.  We love trying things that are a little out of the ordinary.

I didn't have much appetite for dinner so I made this just for Husband. I thought it looked and smelled great, but he was kinda meh about it. This was definitely quick and easy, but I won't be making it again. Thanks anyway!

We thought this recipe was tasty.  Will probably add soy sauce next time to add a little more salt.  Perfect recipe for a low-carb diet!

It is a good start to a recipe. It needs more flavor so I will tweak it next time.

I used breasts instead of thighs but other than that I made as written. I didn't care for the texture of this and the peanuts did not salt the chicken enough even though there is a ton of sodium in them. This baked up nicely but it is not something I'd make again. Sorry.
