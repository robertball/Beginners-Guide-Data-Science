This turned out great.  I used half the garlic powder because the stuffing mix I used was heavily seasoned.  I used large turkey tenderloins so cooked a little longer.  I would suggest covering them with foil after about 20 minutes as I noticed the coating was getting quite brown.

I made it exactly as in the recipe. It was quick to make and good tasting. Made a brown sauce with mushrooms from a package for the topping.
