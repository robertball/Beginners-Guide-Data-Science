Excellent.  All of my children loved it including my picky 13 y/o and 4 y/o boys who don't like squash.  I didn't have any rum so I substituted 1 1/2 tsp rum extract which is less than the recommended substitution.  However, I did not want it to be overpowering for the kids.  They are already requesting I make it again.

I add some cranberries to enhance the color the dish. 
This is an easy prepared dish. 
It tastes sweet, especially good when eat with salty foods.
I love its simple and original taste of butternut squash.

This squash has a wonderful flavor.  Disappeared when I served it for dinner.

While we enjoyed this recipe, the sweetness was a little overwhelming. We added some cinnamon which helped.  I think adding some warm spices like cinnamon, allspice, clove, and/or black pepper, as well as increasing the nutmeg slightly, would better balance the dish.  The technique of steaming on the stove top produced deliciously tender squash.  I did leave the lid on a skillet and only took it off to reduce the sauce.  I think people who are unhappy with how long it needs to cook either cut their squash too large or did not put the lid on to cook. The cook times were spot on for me.

I took this to my mother in law's for a birthday celebration dinner and it was a hit  with the adults and teen agers! I decided to add a sliced apple because I had one on hand. I also added a little butter in the sauce and sprinkled a few chopped pecans over it. So tasty!

It was good, but not spectacular like I was hoping.  It took a lot longer to make this than I expected too.  My squash was not soft after 15 minutes of simmering...maybe my slices were too thick.  I ended up cooking it for closer to 35 minutes... The reduction was delicious on top...but I think next time  squash with butter and brown sugar will be just fine.  i made no substitutions to the recipe...

This is a great way to prepare butternut squash.   We added cranberries also. And I didn't have any dark room, so we used light room and it still came out good.

I doubled the sauce and cooked longer than 15 minutes because my squash was large. I will definitely make it again.

I loved this and would give it a 5 star from me but my kids still didn't eat it. Made it exactly like the recipe. The cranberries were the kids favorite part.

I made this in my instant pot pressure cooker and cooked it for 20 minutes. Very good and easy to make. It came out tender but not mushy. Great flavor.

I was a little rough with the tender squash and as it broke apart it wasn't so pretty. I mashed it together with the glaze I also added a sweet potato to bulk it up for a large crowd. It was fantastic. Very flavourful and sweet. I will make again.

I thought this would have more of a maple flavor but I couldn't really taste it. All I could really taste when it was done was the rum flavor. I couldn't taste the nutmeg either. Maybe I just had a really huge squash??

My Daughter literally couldn't wait to cooked all, she kept licking the spoons I was using to stir ( had to wash them several times, lol) 
So far is a keeper!
