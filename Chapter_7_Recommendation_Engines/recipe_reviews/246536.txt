The batter mixed up well, and although a bit thick,  they cooked fine. The pancakes were a little heavy, but okay. The peanut butter flavor was predominate. These were tough to rate for me. Overall, the pancakes looked nice and tasted fine, but they weren't a favorite. I encourage people to try them, because you may like them.
