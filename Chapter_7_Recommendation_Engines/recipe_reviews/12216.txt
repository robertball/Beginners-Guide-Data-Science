Very sweet, very rich, VERY delicious - made even richer and more delicious by the dollops of double cream we served it with.  If you want a festive pie (for example if you really hated the person whoâ€™s died), replacing a bit of the water with a slug of booze (I used rum) kicks it up several notches.  Although, granted, it might not be a very Amish thing to do!  I can thoroughly recommend Grandma's Secret Pie Crust from this site to make it.

This was very good. Made for my mother who loves raisins. I don't care for them in quite such abundance (don't care for mincemeat, either).  I made this twice. Once as-is (I think every recipe deserves that), and once modifying it so that it appealed to other family members who wanted something less "mince meat like."  I stirred in 1/2 cup of pecans in place of 1/2 cup of raisins, and, I stirred in 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  The end result was something like a "Chunky Raisin Pecan Candy Bar."  The menfolk much preferred this version.

"Funeral pie" is a recipe that mainstream American cookbooks have featured for years (I have several 1930s cookbooks that feature it). Its reputation as a pie for mourners is well-established, but as for its Amish origin, I've never heard such a claim made.  Even if this recipe can't be appreciated as Amish, it's an old American classic -- and I think everyone can appreciate THAT! :)

This was delicious, like a sweeter, subtler version of mincemeat pie. Everyone in the family liked it, but we did change the name to "Amish Raisin Pie" because "Funeral Pie" was a little morbid.

I'm English and when I baked this pie for my family they found it wonderfully unusual, and very delicious. I love it; it really wasn't very difficult and the result was spot on. I'll keep this recipe and do it again and again!

I'd compare this recipe to apple pie but take out the apples & substitute for raisins. I made this for friends/family & the verdict was across the board ... not good! Even my husband, who eats practically anything, took one bite & was done. :o( I had high hopes!

I think people couldn't get past the texture. ?? Goood luck!

The pie didn't 'gel' even with extra corn flour and the flavour was a bit iffy. This is not a recipe I would make again.
