I've done this , essentially , several times , and it's always been very good ..
(HINT: when you buy your bird,  be sure to buy an extra package of  turkey thighs/legs!... to make the gravey !!!  .. You'll not have any 'pan drippings' with this deep-fry technique, so you'll need to 'pan fry in stove's oven'   those thawed legs/thighs to prepare your grandmom's favorite gravey recipe !
Now : Back to the bird :

I want to strongly STRESS that there must be NO ICE , NO FROZEN area/region in the bird whatSO EVER ...  Forgetting that can actually result in an EXPLOSION when bird is lowered inth the very hot oil ! EVEN IF THE FLAME IS OUT!   So, do follow the advice here, made more emphatic by this lil note of mine!!  "There's nothing like knowing the consequences of a dangerous act  quite like KNOWing what the consequences might be!   1) NO ice/frozen part of bird , 2) DO IT OUTDOORS , and especially 3) NEVER ON YOUR PORCH OR DECK!.    4)  MAKE SURE the level of oil needed is known, and that there's aat LEAST  5 inches between the top of the oil level and the top of the pot !  .. the oil WILL RISE as bird is lowered into it ... 5) SHUT OFF THE FLAME of a flame-fed system whenever inserting the bird OR removing it! ...  lest oil dripping over the edge of the pot IGNITE ...   ( Did we say 'Fire Extinguisher rated for Oil fires ???  oh yeah, we did!! )

This is serious business, so pay attention!

Alternative:  use one of the newer ' Electric Turkey Deep Fryers' !!   'ButterBall make

easy peasy. I love deep frying turkey, to me, its better then oven roasted.  I fry 4-5 turkeys a year, friends and family love it.
