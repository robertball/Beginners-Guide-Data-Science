My fiance is from India and we make a similar recipe on a regular basis.  You don't need to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  After the chick peas are softened, use a potato masher and mash them a little bit.  Don't mash them all, just mash them so some get smushed.  This will thicken the sauce naturally.  Just let it simmer for a few minutes and it will thicken right up.  I also add 1 tsp. garam masala, 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. of cumin, 2tsp. salt, and a little bit of cayenne pepper (around a 1/4 tsp).  You can also use 1 tsp. of coriander if you like.  Garnish with fresh cilantro when serving.  We always use red onions and the tomatoes should be diced, not quartered like in the picture with the recipe.  I love this recipe.  It is really healthy and delicious.

My husband and I loved this!! We can't get enough of it! I was really excited to find an accessible indian recipe. 

I didn't have channa masala so I only used garam. Also, I used helpful suggestions from gnip. I mashed some of the chickpeas to thicken the curry and I added 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. of cumin,1 tsp. of coriander and a little bit of cayenne pepper (around a 1/4 tsp).  I used red onions and then seeded and diced the tomatoes

This is very easy and tasty.  I used 1 tsp. of garam masala because I couldn't find the other spice listed. Enjoyed it with naan with mango chuntey and almonds, indian-style cauliflower, indian-style eggplant, and indian-style okra (all from this site.)

This is a very good "channa masala".  I cook the dish a lot longer (until the liquid reduces almost completely and the chick peas are very soft). This just takes more like my favorite Indian restaurants do it. I love Indian food and I am always trying to cook it at home.  This is the first success I have had.  Some day I will have to get lessons from someone who grew up cooking Indian.  Until then, I will have this recipe as one of my staples. Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!

Loved it!  I always make a few changes to recipes:  increased the amount of masalas a bit to my taste, used red onion, 2 roma tomatoes (squeezed of seeds).  I added a dash of half n half at the end, after the simmer.  Will accompany my curry dishes from now on!  Very healthy side option.

This was fantastic and VERY easy.  I skipped the channa masala in favor of what I had on hand; used mustard seeds, tumeric and corriander.  It is a tasty curry!

This was pretty good. I would recommend adding more garam masala though to give a more indian taste.

Good, and different (to me). This was my first attempt at middle eastern cuisine. I bought a bag of chickpeas  and started searching for a recipe I could make with what I had in my cabinet. I made the following changes due to necessity: I cooked the garbanzos instead of using canned, which took 3 hours. I used curry powder, cumin, and turmeric in place of the garam masala, which I'm sure had a dramatic effect on the flavor. I also added red pepper and two chili peppers as I had seen in another recipe. The final product was really good, though the cumin was a little overpowering. If you have to substitute spices like I did go easy on the cumin.

This is one of the best Indian dishes I've tasted!  I did not have channa masala so used other reviewers suggestions of 1 tsp. garam masala, 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. of cumin, 2tsp. salt, 1 tsp. coriander and 1/4 tsp. cayenne. I also mashed some of the peas to thicken but it took twice the recommended cooking time to boil down.  Next time I'll use 1c water instead of 1-1/2.  Excellent.

Very good, I have been making this a long time, minus the ginger. I add a sliced sweet red bell pepper to the onions and put only about 1/2 cup water (cuz I like it a little drier, it is so good with grilled fish!). It is not mandatory to use those spices either, you can use about 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin and a little curry powder and a dash of cinnamon.  People are more likely to have those spices at home.

LOVE this!  I used this recipe as a base and then altered it with additions from Cholay and Chickpea Curry on this site, mostly for more spices.  This is so good, I could eat it every week.  The leftovers became even more delicious too!  Yay for leftovers!!!

This is very tasty and healthy. I only give it four stars as is, but five if you make the changes suggested by ginniej - It tastes better and no need to go to a specialty store for a spice mix.

Great recipe...but I made some changes: I cooked much longer, and pureed about 1/4 to give a more gravy-like texture common to this dish in India. Also, I add a 1/4 or so teaspoon of tamarind paste (if you have it) to give a bit darker color and for taste.  I added several squirts of lemon, and a bit of cayenne pepper; also added fresh coriander at the end.  Great if you serve with Jeera Rice - which is just rice cooked normally but you add in a couple of teaspoons of cumin seeds as you start to cook the rice.

i loved this, my husband less so, but his only criticism was that it had too many chickpeas in it...so take from that what you will!  the flavour was lovely, and mashing up a few of the chickpeas thickened the sauce beautifully.  I served this as an accompaniment to Saag Paneer (Spinach and Cheese Curd) with homemade naan bread---it was terrific!  thank you!

Fantastic! I mixed in a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce a little and added a bit more channa masala.  Next time I think I'll add a bit more liquid too - we like to have a little extra sauce to dip our naan in.

I made this alongside of curried chicken last night. I have to admit I followed the advice of others and added some additional spices (coriander, cayenne). I also accidently increased the onion to a whole cup. I absolutely loved this dish and the leftovers were even better. Will definitely make again.

This was easy and tasty and nutritious. I used tomato paste instead of a tomato and added cumin, tumeric and fenugreek. Quick and yummy dinner with some rice and naan.

I didn't have channa masala or tomatoes, so I added other spices (cumin, cayenne, and TONS of cilantro) and I wasn't happy with the flavor after the 20 minutes of simmering so I let it go for another 20 minutes. Also I mashed them I little to thicken it. Served it topped with cilantro and homemade naan. I know I changed it, but I was going for the flavor that I like from the local Indian restaurant.

pretty great.  I added some cornstarch to thicken it.  Serve on brown rice and then spoon some yogurt over top ( i dilute low-fat plain yogurt and add dried mint).

I have made this twice now, and love this recipe. I add 1 tsp of ground cumin, 1 tsp ground coriander and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. We love garlic in my house so I also add 2 additional cloves of garlic. This is good over basmati rice, or even with saltine crackers! One additional thing- after cooking, I like to let this sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavor really set in. But it tastes great when eaten right away too.

I'm new to cooking indian food, and this turned out very well. I used more garam masala instead of channa masala spice mix, and added a bit more than called for just before serving. I also stirred in 2 cubes of cream that I had frozen in an icecube tray for just such an occasion. Very tasty.

I made this exactly as described.  We loved it.  I will double the recipe next time so we can have leftovers for lunch.  Also, will try the suggestion of lightly mashing a few of the peas to thicken the sauce.

It was good but lacked flavor.  Not sure an 1/8 of tsp of Garam Masala really did anything.  Will research other recipes with higher spice levels

I made all the masalas and store the spices in the freezer.  This recipe was perfect for my choice of not heavy-handed on the spices.  It tasted just like when I go to the Indian restaurant and I choose "mildly" spiced.  I was in dream land as I ate it.  The recipe for Chana masala was my innovation of taking the idea of another chick pea recipe and incorporating two loose ingredients.  Now it  my own style of chana masala with these 2 things added.  I put coconut flakes and lemon pepper in the chana m.  Put some olive oil on the table to use sparingly.  Also put coriander leaves on the plate just before eating.  This is my favorite dish from now on.

This was delicious. The only change I made was to the chickpeas. I used dry chickpeas and partly cooked them before adding to the slow cooker. This has became a regular meal for my family.

I used 1 tsp each of Garam masala, cumin and turmeric; & 1/2 tsp of pink salt and all of the water.  I used no cayenne.   Was pretty good!  I also cooked brown rice and took some of it, the beans, and a salad for lunch.

This is the second time I’ve made this. That says a lot because I hate to cook and it has more than one step. This time I actually made the paste and it was so worth the extra effort. It only took a few minutes more, but completely changed the texture. Like last time, I used 1/8 tsp ground ginger (I may go up to 1/4, I rarely use it so never have fresh) and I was out of coriander, so before adding chickpeas I did add 1 tsp of cumin. This is easy to make and really delicious.

Followed the alterations suggested by ginniej and thankfully I did. Without those, this would have been way to bland for my tastes. Even with her additions, I ended up tripling the spices. However I believe I'm in the minority here as I have the North Indian palate. Other than that, super simple instructions and a great starter for this type of recipe.

We really like this; when spooned over a pile of cooked brown rice or buckwheat groats (kasha), it makes for an easy and healthy meal.  I bump up the garam masala to a full teaspoon and make up my own "channa masala" mix with coriander, cumin, turmeric, and ground cardamom.  I mash about half the beans to thicken, then throw in about a 1/4 cup chopped cilantro and some salt and pepper to finish.  Delicious!

My only advise is to be careful of the amount of heat.

The first time I made it it was too hot for me to eat.
I cut the heat my half for my second and third batches and love it.

Very tasty. Even with canned chickpeas, I find that it needs to cook for 2-3 hours before the chickpeas are tender enough for my taste (I live at a high elevation). After about an hour of cooking I slightly mash some of the cooked chickpeas to make make the sauce thicker.
