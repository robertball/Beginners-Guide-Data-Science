Me and my husband adore this recipe! I make it at least once a month. Instead of chili paste (because I can never find it) I use tomatoe paste and I add all the sauces until it tastes right to me.  If it looks dry, I add chicken or beef broth.  We love to mix the left overs with the rice and put in the fridge for the next day.  Tastes even better the next day for lunch!  Great recipe, thanks!

Quick, easy, and tasty. I couldn't find chili paste, so I used this Thai sweet and spicy chili sauce instead and it was fine. I would like to find the chili paste and try it next time I make it (there will be a next time). I also doubled the sauce mixture and for us, that would have been necessary. I used just red pepper and I added shredded carrots, broccoli, and cabbage. I think mushrooms would be good as well. Overall, very versatile recipe.

This was fantastic...I kind of miscalculated the amounts of ginger and garlic, but the result was fantastic.  The ginger plays a key role in the dish, and it compliments the hot of the red pepper, and the tang of the garlic perfectly.  I didn't use red bells, because of the cost in my area(at $2.99a pound, you'd probably agree), but the green pepper was perfect, nontheless.  I did have to make my own chile paste using tomato paste, hot sauce, chile owder, and paprika, but the effect was the same.  Everyone gobbledit up, and my friend, an aspiring chef, told me that he would make this at home, quite the compliment.  Thank you for such a great way to use ordinary ground beef!!

This was really yummy.  Instead of rice, I served it with lettuce cups and a quick sauce made of equal parts soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chile paste.  Spicy, flavorful, and crisp!

I was pretty impressed with this dish.  I was trying to find something quick and easy to use the ground turkey and brocolli in my fridge.  I didn't have chile paste nor green peppers and used chicken broth instead of beef and it turned out wonderful.  My daughter loved it and it is very versatile.  Throw in what ever veggies you can find.

This was fast and easy and good! I used ground ginger, frozen sliced red, green and yellow peppers with onion and beef soup base. I added sliced water chestnuts for a little added crunch. This recipe could be so versatile. Just add veggies you like ( broccoli would be good). If you enjoy aisian food, you should really like this one.

A very good meal!  I used only green bell peppers to save $$ and tomato paste instead of chile.  Also, I quadrupled the liquids.  And, I served it with brown rice.  I will definitely make this again!

I only had one yellow pepper, but it worked out. I'm sure it is even better with the correct amount of peppers, no matter what color. I subbed 1 tbsp of dried parsley and a little more than 1 tsp of ground ginger. Since I did not have low-sodium soy sauce, I did regular and omitted the extra salt. I used Thai chili sauce for the paste, and basmati rice instead of jasmine. Jasmine rice is too much like eating perfume for me. Overall, I thought this dish was really easy, and really tasty, and I look forward to making it with the right amount of peppers!

This has become a regular for our family. Substitute more crushed red pepper for the chile paste, and I add a lot more ginger and garlic for a bolder taste.

I like the idea of having ground beef in a stir fry, as it's a use for hamburger that I hadn't seen before.  And it worked quite well.  However, I found this recipe to be quite bland as written.  I added Chinese 5 Spice, Hoisin Sauce, Black Bean and Garlic sauce, and spicy Sriracha sauce which jazzed it up somewhat.  I served it over brown rice which stood up well to the texture of the beef and the peppers.  I will probably make it again since my kids (ages 6 & 3) ate it and it was very easy to put together.

I didn't have much hope for ground beef in an Asian recipe, but what a delightful new use for hamburger! I did follow some recommendations. I put in the onions and broccoli. And I put in a full cup of beef broth with some corn starch. We like sauce with our rice . Other than that, the ginger, soy sauce, and garlic did wonders. Thank you.

To make this dish taste the way it's supposed to, add honey to cut the acid of the peppers.  Don't add so much that it makes the dish sweet, just until you can aptly taste the flavors.  For me, that was several tablespoons.

Very nice flavor. I didn't have ginger and I didn't use the hot pepper and chili sauce (because of my kids) and it still turned out really good. Thank you for an easy and tasty recipe.

Great flavor, just a little too hot for my taste.  Hubby LOVED this!! Was better as leftovers mixed with the rice. Next time will cut back a little on the red pepper flakes.

We have a ton of ground beef and I was so excited to find an Asian recipe with ground beef.  We were not real impressed.  It needs more flavor and sauce to be really good.

I did not have the ginger, so I added some sugar.  This has a nice heat.  If you don't like spicy, omit those items which add it.  I would try this again with broccoli, mushrooms and just one of the peppers.  The sauce is nice and doesn't overpower the flavor of the veggies.

I made this spur of the moment, so I had to use what I had on hand.  I omitted the Worcestershire sauce and used extra soy sauce instead, ground ginger instead of fresh, and I added onions and mushrooms.  We like spicy food, so I added some crushed red pepper as well.  All in all, a great recipe and my husband, the pickiest eater in the world loved it!

Excellent!  I make it different every time substituting ingredients I have in fridge that day.  More often than not, I leave out the vinegar altogether.

I read the reviews, but mostly changed it a little as I cooked it. I wanted more veg, so I steamed some green beans until about two-thirds done, then added it to the peppers as I stir-fried them.  Added a half onion as well as the garlic. As I was stir-frying this I put the sauce ingredients in a bowl to blend: one can beef broth, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 2 tbsp sweet hot chile paste, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp powdered ginger (didn't have fresh).  I tasted and it seemed too sweet.  I added 1/4 cup cider vinegar and 1 tbsp sesame oil. I poured the sauce in with the hamburger and let it simmer a bit.  The sauce seemed too thin and watery, so I mixed about 1/3 cup cornstarch with 1/3 cup water, added and stirred.  Thickened beautifully, of course. Forgot about the Worcestershire entirely! This all worked quite well, although I'd added more black pepper than I should have and it was on the hot side. My kids didn't complain about the green beans as much as usual. This version will go into the rotation, with changes on the veg as wanted.

great recipe. I also use a halepeno pepper, twice the chili sauce and a can of diced tomatoes if I don't have or use the beef broth. The juice from the tomatoes makes enough broth.

Very good! I didn't have any green pepper so I used chopped Vidalia onion. I doubled the sauce ingredients and a dash more crushed red pepper. Loved it!!

This was very nice.I followed another reviewer's idea and made Lettuce wraps with Romaine leaves.I did cut my peppers in cubes. I used some Hoisin sauce for a dip; turned out so good!

Really good and light. The "sauce" isn't overpowering, just enough to moisten and mildly flavor the dish. I added broccoli, used red instead of green peppers, only had ginger paste on hand along with dried parsley. Dried parsley doesn't usually do it for me, but that was a good find - next time I'll use fresh basil to recreate the flavor of one of my favorite Thai restaurants. Any mix of veggies will do but the broccoli was nice. I'll add thin, baby green beans next time I get them at Costco. Quick fix and my husband enjoyed it so this is definitely a keeper.

I found this to be pretty tasty but I don't think it was 5 star worthy... It was good, especially if you are looking for a fast, a little different, tasty dinner! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times and I omitted the ginger and added a little vinegar and a teaspoon of sugar, for the chili paste I use Sriracha hot chili sauce.This is a quick and easy meal that my family loves. I gave the recipe 4 stars because I made changes to suit my personal taste.

This is AMAZING :)  I did not have fresh peppers on hand, so I did not add those.  This would have more than five stars if it could and I will have to make a double batch next time because nobody got enough of it!!!

This recipe as written I give 3 stars. It was a little bland - for some reason all of the flavors did not get incorporated very well into the dish. But it can easily be improved. Next time I'll probably double the "sauce" ingredients (along with the garlic and ginger) so that I can cook it longer without drying out. When the sauce cooks down it should become more flavorful. I will say that it was very easy - perfect for a mom!

I love this dish because it is quick and easy! I added a chopped up onion with the peppers and it was very tasty. Next time I think I will double the sauce so that there will be more to soak into the yummy rice.

I was very dissapointed with this recipe.  It tasted more like a ground beef (ground turkey, in my case) goulash than an asian dish.  Possibly I would have had different outcome if I had used sliced steak, pork, chicken or shrimp.  I don't think I will make this dish again.

Found this to be very good. I cooked the meat (used ground turkey), then added the seasonings, then added green pepper/onion/diced carrots to it. My company loved it over brown rice, and I was very pleased to be able to have used ground meat to make a good Asian style dish.

This is a great weeknight meal. I liked the Asian twist to ground beef also. My biggest change was to use brown rice rather than jasmine rice.

This is very good!  But more importantly, it reminds me very much of the canned LaChoy Stir Fry Vegetable mix that you add ground beef to.  My mom used to make this all the time when I was a kid.  It was served over Asian RiceaRoni with slivered almonds.  I used red and green pepper, added onion and carrot, and used both fresh and powdered ginger.  It is a 4 star meal, but gets the extra star for giving me a sentimental trip back to my childhood!

Flavor is good but better as a stirfry with steak rather than ground beef.  I also added mushrms.  And stired 1tsp cornstarch into the beef stock so the sauce would be thick.

This was surprisingly good - I was a bit skeptical, using ground beef in a stir-fry, but the flavor was great!  I didn't have chili paste, so I used a thai garlic paste instead - yum!  Like others, I used more liquid and spices, since ground beef tends to be pretty dry.  Next time, I'll try it with broccoli and water chestnuts.  All in all, an inventive way to use ground beef!

The taste reminded me a bit of sukiyaki that I ate in Japan.  I used banana peppers and green beans - doubled the sauce and added a little brown sugar.  Next time I think I'll try making the stir fry with mushrooms and spinach.

Great! I added an onion before I browned the beef and eyeballed the crushed pepper and ginger. I served it with brown rice and just mixed it all together. I skipped the parsley because I didn't have any. Yum!

I made this recipe initially by modifying to make it Vegan for my vegan sister and her husband. I used the soy protein "gound beef" and vegetable broth and it was fantastic - much better than I thought it would be.  I have yet to make this using ground beef... but instead prefer ground pork or ground chicken.  I use a little more ginger and garlic than this recipe calls for and add water chestnuts for extra crunch.  A great recipe that can be made with whatever you have on hand in your vege bin!

This was a great change from usual ground beef recipes.  I added some vegetables - leeks, snow peas, carrots, broccoli - and increased the amount of liquids to make up for the additional vegetables.  Will make again!  Thanks!

I also added 1 chopped yellow onion, and substituted 2 fresh red chili peppers for the chili paste and substituted poblano pepper for the red bell pepper. I served this over pasta instead and with plain yogurt on the side; my husband even put some of the yogurt on top. He loved it and said it reminded him of Turkish food. Will definitely keep this recipe in the regular dinner rotation!

I am very happy I made this recipe.  Was looking for something new to do with grounde beef other than spaghetti or chili.  I used the ingredients I had.  There were a few alterations like adding more stock, soy and worcestshire sauce for flavor.  Other than that I was very pleased.

This recipe is very tastey.  I could not find chili paste so I used a tbls.of tomato paste and some chili powder.  It turned out very good.

This was really good!  I used more spices though, 1/4 tsp just didn't seem like enough.  Next time I might add some mushrooms.

I was looking for something new to do with ground beef.  I found this recipe and it was outstanding!  I did not have chili paste, so that was omitted with no problems.  I also sprinkled a little flour on the ground beef beef before adding the liquids, thus thickening the sauce ultimately. Using store bought chopped ginger (the kind in a jar that gets refrigerated after opening) was helpful. My kids and husband all asked for seconds!

Boyfriend said, amidst mmm-ing noises, "You can make this all the time.  This is my favorite ever."  I used about half the beef, but that's something I normally do with recipes calling for ground beef.  Instead of serving it over rice, we mixed it with Nasoya Chinese noodles.

This dish smelled so good while it's cooking and the taste didn't disappoint. I used one each of a green, yellow, and red bell pepper and two dashes of cayenne red pepper instead of chili paste and 1/2 c. beef broth instead of 1/4 c. (this soaked into the rice and made the dish a little jucier). This will become a regularly cooked meal for my husband and me.

I am always looking for ground beef recipes, because we have a whole freezer full of ground elk meat at home (much leaner than beef!), and this made a decent weeknight meal.  Except grating the ginger always takes SO long!??!?  I agree it was more spicy than flavorful, not a good recipe for a dinner party.

This was very tasty. I used thin sliced steak instead of hamburger and added about 1/4 cup of cooking sherry. I served it over linguine and my family enjoyed it.

Doubled, this was still not excessive for my family of five.  I added a sliced sweet onion too, and served it with chili sauce, so people could kick it up to their preference.  Very quick, satisfying and tasty.

We loved this recipe!  It had an interesting flavor that my husband, myself, and my 17 month old daughter just loved.  Next time I make it, I want more green pepper.  I think the peppers I used this time were too small and therefore the hamburger started to slightly overwhelm the flavor.  But, this one is a keeper!

Simple, easy and very tasty! I used ground venison with a small amount of ground pork sausage I had on hand. I skipped the crushed red pepper as husband is not a fan of hot and spicy and I used siracha instead of chili paste. I used ground ginger as well. I will make again especially since my husband could not tell it was venison... he’s not a fan of venison.

Came out wonderful!i didn’t have soy and made my own chile paste (ketchup and crushed red pepper flakes). I used yellow, orange and red peppers instead of green. It was excellent - all my picky eaters loved it! Definitely going into rotation.

I did not have beef stock so I used chicken stock. However, both my husband and I thought it still tasted very good and was easy to make. I had some rice leftover from a previous meal that worked perfectly with this. This is a great weeknight meal!

I made this and it was goooooooood! I sliced peppers into wedges and added an onion to the recipe. I also tossed seasonings with vegetables in a bowl before placing them in the skillet. I also used garlic infused olive oil instead of regular. Next time I will add some brown sugar for a sweet and spicy flavor.

Simple, easy and tasty! I improvised a lot - added celery & onion with my red bell pepper, used tomato paste, ground ginger, chicken stock. So technically I didn’t follow the recipe exactly but I love recipes that I can adapt to what I have and still turn out great! Has a nice Asian flavor and it was ready in 30 minutes.  Will make again!!

This is a tasty and different recipe for my boring ground beef dinners. I added chopped onion and substituted chili sauce for tomato paste and Dat’l Do-It pepper sauce, added a little more when it came to the liquids and let it all cook together 20 minutes. The jasmine rice was a good compliment. Thanks.

Wow. Never having used gr beef in an Asian recipe, we did not know what to expect. We loved it, even my somewhat skeptical teenage g-daughter. I did not have the amt of bell peppers called for, so will make again with what is needed. I served with the Celery Almandine recipe from this site. I guessed they would work well together. They were a hit!

WOW....just WOW! What a delicious yet simple to make recipe!! I’d say is one of my top 5 recipes from here! I saved it a while ago but never made until yesterday. It’s packed with lots of flavor, the combination of the ingredients is perfection. I pretty much followed the recipe as instructed but added a bit more dashes of the soy sauce and horseradish and salt as I thought it needed more (I always taste my food as I go, to ensure perfection). Anyway! I paired it with our favorite rice of course: Jasmin! I also didn’t add the whole teaspoon of chili paste because of the kids, only used 1/2. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to all. I am thinking about trying it with ground turkey next!

I had all the ingredients and it turned out great! I added the ginger to the rice while it was cooking in broth.

Very tasty! I made for my kids as follows: used ground turkey and chicken stock instead of beef. no pepper flakes or chili paste. Yellow pepper instead of green. Added chopped spinach. Sauteed in sesame oil. Used 1tbsp ginger paste instead of 2tbsp fresh.  At the end added 1cup water mixed with cornstarch to create more sauce. Even my picky Eater loved this version!

Loved this creative use for ground beef.  Added carrots, celery and stuck with red and yellow peppers.   Used more freshly grated ginger as well as crushed red pepper because we prefer a little more heat, but DELICIOUS.  Was just as great over quinoa as rice.  Will definitely make again (and again!)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic recipe. If you do not want a slow burn build up (kid friendlier) do not use chili paste. Substitute with a store bought sweet chili sauce instead.

I just happened to have all the ingredients for this (and not much of anything else) and was delighted at how quick, easy and unique it was. Even more delicious when my teenage sons said "this is awesome!". Will do it again!!

Amazing! I converted this to a crockpot recipe and here's what I changed: 3.5 lbs ground beef. Instead of soy sauce I used hoisin sauce (about 3/4 cup), instead of chili paste used tomato paste with chili powder and hot sauce (~ 4 tablespoons tomato paste/heaping tablespoon chili powder/several dashes of hot sauce). Used about a cup of grated ginger, about 10 minced garlic cloves, 3/4 cup beef stock (was actually 3/4 cup water with 1 beef bouillon cube), 1.5 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper, 1 teaspoon black pepper, no salt . After browning the ground beef, added all but the peppers and parsley and cooked on low for 6 hours, then added the rest and cooked on low for 1.5 hours. Great flavor! Kind of spicy, so you may want to hold back on the crushed red peppers and hot sauce if you don't like it too hot.

Made as written except for chili paste, which I did not have. Also used brown rice. Easy and flexible--you can add different vegetables or sauces--whatever seems "Asian" to you.

I had to quickly use some aging ground beef I found in the refrigerator and decided to try this recipe. I liked the recipe very much, although I'll confess to amending the recipe by adding some kung pao sauce (for extra heat). The first serving was very good over rice, the second, for lunch the next day was excellent, wrapped in a tortilla and the final portions were very nice layered with sliced potatoes in a casserole. This recipe is easy and very versatile. Thanks amanda1432!

I used Pasillo peppers instead of green peppers and didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I used A1 sauce. It was a hit with the entire family! I used brown rice instead of white and added a tsp. of sugar (to me it tasted a bit too bitter without it). My family of 4 ate every last bite!

This was wonderful!  We made just as directed and everyone in the family (even our picky preschooler) loved it.  I've noticed some people talk, in their reviews, about not being able to find chili paste.  Chili paste is very easy to make, just mix chili powder with a little water to form a paste.  Then you are able to measure out the amount you need.  We look forward to adding this to our meal rotation :).

We loved this! I added some carrots and celery, doubled the stock, soya and Worcestershire, and omitted the crushed red pepper. Doing this gave some heat but did not overpower the other flavours. Served this over udon noodles.

i love this recipe! I've made it numerous times already! The only changes I made was to add sauteed onions and mushrooms. I also omitted the red peppers and chile as I didn't have it on hand but added extra ginger and garlic.

This was very tasty and very quick to put together.  I used different vegetables, just what I had to hand (celery/carrot/bell pepper/water chestnut/onion and some green onion for garnish).  Also I had lean beef, so cooked it a little then cooked the vegetables along with the beef.  Will definitely make this again!

A nice flair to give ground beef another way to be eaten.  Doubled recipe for the family.  Only thing we did not use was jasmine rice as we had other in house and used it instead.

I thought this was great. I found it very versatile. Instead of putting two whole peppers in it, I put a quarter of each and then put a little bit of everything in my fridge, bok choy, zucchini, cauliflower, brocolli, carrot, onion and it was brilliant. I also had some left over rice from the night before, instead of heating it up, I just added it when I added the meat back. I thought the two table spoons of ginger would be over powering but it was lovely. I was also hesitant about adding the chilli as one of our diners isn't the biggest fan of heat but it was great, barely noticable (i would probably add a little extra if it was just me and the hubby). I also needed a little extra stock and soy sauce to account for the extra veggies I added. Thank You for a great stir fry style dish that I could whip up from everything I had at home!

This was very good!  I was worried that ground beef stir fry would be bland, but it was full of flavor.  We used ground turkey instead of beef and chicken broth instead of beef broth, otherwise we followed the recipe.  Served over brown rice.  Filling and satisfying meal.

Considering the amount of flavor components that go into this dish, I found it to be surprisingly bland. Edible, a nice change of pace, but not memorable.

This is a wonderful dish - full of flavor and easy to prepare.  Usually these type of dishes call for stir-fried steak or steak flank, so I was a bit apprehensive about using ground beef.  However, the ground beef tasted great and did not bring the meal 'down'.  This is a great, versatile recipe for ground beef - a real crowd pleaser!

I was looking for something different to use ground beef.  The flavor was good but we did not like the ground beef in this recipe at all.  Would be much better with sliced round steak.

Very good. SUPER easy and a great new way to use ground turkey (or beef) instead of the same old chili or pasta.  

Also, I added carrots cut in paper thin slices and served with soba noodles instead of rice. Yummy!!!

This was economical and quick, but the taste showed it. I found it ok, but my husband hated it and he eats anything. So many others reviewed it highly, however, so I guess it's just a matter of taste!

This was actually much better than I expected. I pretty much just eyeballed the seasonings, and I also omitted the parsley due to personal preference. Quick, easy and tasty. Thanks!

I didn't have chilie past instead i used 1 dried red chili and it turned out lovely! although i'm not really a fan of ginger much so i tapered down to 1 tablespoon and added some green peas as well. My husband loved it!

This was just the right amount of spicy.  I used dried ginger because I didn't have any fresh, and it was still good.

Just cooked this for a quick dinner and it turned out very nicely! I pretty much followed the recipe but added chopped white onion. I also served it with brown rice with barley. Healthy and delicious!

Not what I expected. To me it tasted bland.  It was good but not great.

a little spicier than i expected.  Add some beans and you have chili con carne.  Not as exciting as i had hoped.

This smells absolutely wonderful while cooking and it cooks up quickly.  I also couldn't find the chile paste so I left that out but followed the recipe otherwise. I also liked the versatility of throwing leftover vegetables in this if I had any. The rice was nice served with this.  Delicious!!

I liked this but my husband didn't, so I'm giving it an average rating.  I think maybe with more sauce it would have been better.  I will try it again but with extra sauce.

Made this last night.  It is a keeper. Took some advice and added a bit of flour to the beef. Used brown basmati rice as that what I had on hand. Very good dish for the fall.

I made this as a surprise lunch for my husband. He's been craving Asian food for a while now and he was very pleased! I didn't have the chili paste, so I used tomato paste. I used beef broth instead of the beef stock and I couldn't notice a difference :-)
My husband thoroughly enjoyed this meal...and he has leftovers for tomorrow!! :-)
Thanks for this delicious recipe!

The taste wasn't what i expected it to be, and i found that it needed much more seasoning than the recipe required, but all in all it was quite tasty

Very tasty!  I used yellow and red peppers and tossed in some edamame to add more color.   I also substituted tandoori paste for the chili paste, because that's what I had handy.   It also held well... we were delayed getting to the table that night and this dish held very nicely on LOW until we were ready to eat.

Easy and delicious!  The best combination as far as I'm concerned.  There is also a lot of room for play with the vegetables.  I may add broccoli the next time I make this dish.

This recipe is okay; I agree with the others that it needs more liquid.  Also, it's missing something.  Needs more flavor; is too meaty.

We used non-meat crumbles instead of ground beef and added 1/2 an onion. This is the best stir-fry I've ever made and my boyfriend really liked it. We will make it again for sure!
