quick, easy, and delish.  I used 2.10 # of boneless breasts and cut them into chunk size pieces and just simmered them in the sauce.  I could see by the quantity of dry rice that it was wayyyyy too much.  I just scaled it down to what I normally use...1 cup rice to 2 cups water.  Didn't have any cardamom pods so used 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom.  Also stuck 4 cloves in w/the rice and frozen peas.  Used heaping 1/4 tsp. tumeric for the yellow color.  Very nice dish.  Definitely recommend the cilantro.  It adds a nice layer of flavor to the dish.

I played around with the spices til it was to our taste. The other changes I made were to use fresh mint, and canned  tomatoes; I used turmeric to color the rice yellow; I also added about half a cup of heavy cream that needed using up. This turned out really good. Thanks!

Far too much rice and, although the flavour is nice it needs more.  The next time I will make only half of the rice and double the garam masala.  Otherwise, it was a hit with the family.

I followed the recipe exactly & agree with halving the rice part of this recipe but keeping everything else the same.  The chicken gets a bit lost in all that rice.  I'm still giving it 5 stars though.  I've made this before and will make it again.   I served this with Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala Sauce from this site - great meal, raves from everyone.  Most had seconds and I still had leftovers to send home with guests.  I made this earlier in the day, refrigerated it until an hour or so before dinner, covered it foil and reheated in 300F oven.  Great.

Never tried this recipe, because it is not even remotely close to any biriyani recipe. If you want to try out Biriyani, please ignore this recipe.
