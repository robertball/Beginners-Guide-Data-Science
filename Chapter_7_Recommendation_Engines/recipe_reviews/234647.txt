I made a scaled down version with only sweet potato and rainbow carrots. This was a great replacement for the old sweet potato 'casserole ' at our holiday dinner, everyone loved it and nobody missed the marshmallows! Will definitely make this again.

My husband really had his work "cut out" for him. Cutting all those root vegetables was a JOB, for sure. However,he said it was worth all the effort. The vegetables were delicious. We added a red pepper and served this with Smoked Chicken Sausage with cheese from Costco.

Wow this was truly delectable! I made a slight change and added a little bit of thyme and a potato to this. I could eat this every week and not tire of it!

I had a bag of frozen root veggies from Costo and thought this would flavor it well.  It had sweet potatoes, parsnips, carrots and onion in it- perfectly cut up which was a huge time saver!   I cut the sauce down by half as it seemed like a lot of butter for the 4 of us.  It was good, not awesome.  I will try again though..... with all the sauce.

went out on a limb here, since these veggies always seem to go bad before i find a way to use them.. we liked this recipe! added a little honey and nutmeg, and cooked about 10 mins longer in the oven.

Delicious! I had everything on hand except the turnip and rutabaga. I did add a thickly chopped onion which added a nice layer of flavor to the dish.  I had it as a side with meatloaf, but I could probably eat a bowl for dinner with no problem. I cut back slightly on the maple syrup after reading some reviews. I needed about 15-20 min more for the roast time. Thanks Kelly, great recipe which I'll surely make again!

This recipe has great flavor and the entire family enjoyed it. Will definitely make this again, even though the chopping of all those root veggies took more than 20 mins.  I was using a brand new oven and to get the veggies tender it took about 20 more  mins. Next time I make this recipe I'll use the convection oven setting to reduce the cook time.
