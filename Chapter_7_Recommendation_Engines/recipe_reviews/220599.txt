I made a homemade meat marinara to go in this casserole. Instead of fat free sour cream, I used reduced fat. The family thought this was great--they ate every bite. NO LEFTOVERS. This was perfect for me because I could make the marinara in the crockpot and quick make the pasta, then mix and bake. I'll make this again.

DELICIOUS!!! A bit involved if you make it "from scratch" (fresh spaghetti in the event that you don't have any leftover), but well worth it!

Followed ingredients exactly.  I used leftover spaghetti. I added a little extra sauce (from a jar) because the leftover spaghetti seemed too dry. This made the final product a little too wet. I didn't take into account that the sour cream & cottage cheese would add additional liquid. I kept the dish loosely covered with foil for half the baking time because I don't like for the cheese to get overly browned too quickly. I uncovered it for the last 20 min. Everyone loved this dish and had seconds. Although we all loved it... I feel like it needs a little more seasoning. Next time I think I will mix in some Italian seasoning, salt and pepper into the cottage cheese mixture. Great way to use leftover spaghetti. I think I will start making extra spaghetti ON PURPOSE and put in freezer so I can make this dish the following week.

I was surprised to see this recipe because this is exactly how I make mine! I use regular sour cream though. It all came about one day when I was going through the fridge looking for stuff to add to left-over spaghetti to bake it. I don't like ricotta (which most people probably would have added instead), so I added some cottage cheese. It wasn't quite creamy enough, so then I added some sour cream as well. It turned out amazing and everyone LOVED it so I've been making it this way ever since. It's just funny because I thought "I" made up this recipe on my own LOL:)It's really very delicious!!!

Good use of leftover spaghetti.  I stirred an egg into the cheese mixture and added some Italian seasoning and garlic.  Very tastey!

To make this, I had to cook more spaghetti noodles, as all I had leftover were homemade Italian-American meatballs -- crumbled into pieces -- and homemade marinara sauce.  Also, I had no cottage cheese, so just mixed regular sour cream with a little shredded Parmesan, and added the end of a package of Cheddar to the mozzarella.  It baked covered for 30 minutes, and uncovered for 10.  Delicious!

This was DELICIOUS. I seriously can't stop shoveling this into my face. So, my boyfriend and I tried it after I ruined some spaghetti into a coagulated mess. It was seriously unsalvageable. But I applied it as directed, and it worked just fine as a noodle layer. I did add an egg to the cheese mixture and a layer of pepperoni (instead of the author's suggested sausage, which I'll try next time), but it would have still been amazing either way---the brilliant sour cream-cottage cheese mixture really ties the dish together. Seriously, try this recipe, it could be a new favorite for you and yours. And if your spaghetti is all dry and gross, here's how to make it tasty again.

First of all, to the person who gave it one star and said "no true lasagna recipe would use cottage cheese and sour cream"... I don't recall this recipe saying it was was authentic anything??  This is a recipe utilizing leftovers.  It is what it is, and it is wonderful.

Yes having married into an Italian family I wondered about the filling too.   And all I have to say is I LOVE IT and will probably swap it for the typical bland ricotta I usually use in my Italian cooking.   I added a little parmesan and some Italian seasoning to it.  It was WONDERFUL!

I keep my own homemade sauce in the freezer in great proportions so I used that.   I did follow the "tip" and put Italian sausage on the bottom prior to layering.

Regardless, I love this concept and i LOVE LOVE the cottage cheese/sour cream filling!    

Thank you for posting this recipe!  I will most definitely prepare it again and again!

Really enjoyable. I did put some cooked meat on the bottom - a mixture we can buy at the grocery store that has hamburger, ground pork and ground veal. And I added some Italian sausage meat as well. Cooked it up with onions and mushrooms. Layered that onto the bottom of the pan, then some wilted spinach, then half of the pasta and sauce. Topped that with the cottage cheese and sour cream mix. Finally topped it with the rest of the pasta and sauce and then the cheese. I didn't find it took as long to cook so I would recommend watching it so the cheese doesn't overcook. Will definitely make it again....with my modifications.

I really liked this, although I don't know that I'd consider it lasagna. I didn't have leftover spaghetti, either, so I used fresh, and cut the recipe down to 2 servings. The 2nd serving made an excellent cold spaghetti sandwich on toast the next day. I think the recipe is a keeper. Oh, and I put some chopped up pepperoni in the sauce. I was worried about putting too much in, and getting it too salty, so I was conservative. I was a bit too conservative, and that was really my only complaint. It's a keeper.

We will be making this again!  Loved it!  Did not use cottage cheese but added Parmesan to sour cream. We used Prego Italian sausage and Garlic and Three Cheese sauces and some meatballs cut up!  Grandkids and my parents loved it too!

I didn't use sour cream & cottage cheese. I went with the traditional ricotta & parm, but I did ADD some things, since my leftover spaghetti fell short of more than one layer. I made more tomato based sauce with kale for a healthy kick, topping it off with 5 Italian Cheese blend instead of just mozzarella. OMG, it was so tasty, & still is bcuz I now have Spaghetti Lasagna leftovers that I had to freeze. It still tastes the same even after being frozen.

This is really good. I didn't have enough leftover meat sauce so I took a can of Italian style dice tomatoes, reduced the juice a tad, added what meat sauce I had leftover and made the rest as recipe called. Family really liked it and so did I. Great, quick dinner meal.

Delicious! I didn't use fat-free sour cream because I hate the consistency. I also used a round, 2 quart CorningWare dish instead which made more layers of goodness. My toddler loved it as well as my husband.

I just made this last night using actual leftover spaghetti that I had in the frige.  I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and italian seasoning to the sour cream cottage cheese mixture.  This was absolutely delicious.  All my family loved it!!!

I will definitely keep this in my recipe box and make it again. Simple and delicious! Can’t go wrong with spaghetti and cheese.

*I added chicken between the two spaghetti layers...so yummy! Might experiment with ground beef or sausage next time.

This was a tasty way to use up leftover vegetarian spaghetti sauce. I followed the advice to add a bit more flavour to the cheese layer, and added in about 1/3 of a cup of grated parmesan and some Italian seasoning. I also had only cheddar to put on top, but it went well with everything else. I can see how adding sausage would enhance the flavour.

My grandma made something like this growing up - it combines the yumminess of lasagna and spaghetti.  
What is this fat free sour cream?  Bleck.  In place of that abomination and cottage cheese (ew) I added whole milk ricotta mixed with two eggs.   I also added browned hamburger to the sauce, which I doubled. 
Super nummy and sure to please even picky eaters.

I made this last night. I found it to be really simple and easy to make. it tasted pretty good, too. It's an excellent base recipe. I think I'd add some meat next time, in addition to some onions and mushrooms as well. I'd make it again.

This was pretty good.  We had leftover spaghetti sauce with ground beef and mushrooms that we used.  Otherwise we followed the recipe exactly except only used 8oz of Mozzarella since that's all we had and then added about a 1/4 c of shredded cheddar.

Every two weeks I make angel hair pasta with grilled Tuscan pork sausage. From now on, I will make sure I have enough left over to make this absolutely delicious dish!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I love spaghetti but my husband thinks it's boring so I never make it. When I found this recipe I was so excited to try it! I did add egg to the cheese mixture as others had mentioned and also added Italian seasonings and garlic. We both went back for seconds ?

Just made it tonight.  I did add hamburger and ground Italian sausage to the sauce.  I have been searching for something that tastes like a recipe my mom made when we were little called "heavenly spaghetti" and this was my latest attempt to recreate that.  It didn't, but it was very good and tasty.  I am anticipating that leftovers tomorrow will be especially good.

Loved this and it was so easy. Initially I cut everything in half. (We are empty nesters.) the second time I made this, this is what I did. 8 ounces pasta, 3 cups sauce, my home made. I used the specified cottage cheese and sour cream as cutting it in half to make 4 servings just wasn't enough.  Everything fit nicely in a 1 1/2 quart casserole the first time, but the second time, I used a 9x9x2 inch baking metal pan. I didn't measure the mozzarella cheese topping, just using what covered everything in a nice layer. TIP: do NOT use pre-shredded cheeses. They put artificial ingredients in it to prevent clumping. This just looks nasty when baked and doesn't melt down into the casserole like it should. Take a minute or two and go for the REAL cheese. You can experiment with your favorite cheeses instead of mozzarella, or use a combination.  My husband and I eat half of this variation and freeze the other half for a day when life gets in the way or we just didn't plan for dinner ahead of time. Thanks for sharing recipe. I changed the servings of this recipe, but not the final results. Delish!!!!

I used left over spaghetti bolgonese but had to cook more spaghetti because I didn't have enough. My teenager and husband loved it. I sprinkled mozzarella cheese after the first layer of cottage cheese/sour cream. I used regular sour cream and 1 jar of sauce. My husband wanted more hamburg but my daughter and I like it without.

Three stars for a good idea that is faultily executed. I didn't make it as is because... Cottage cheese? I used a ricotta, egg, Romano and parsley mixture that is no trouble to mix up and a lot better. I also used a meat marinara sauce. But I like the idea which I hadn't seen before so I give kudos for that. I also put a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan and on the top before the cheese exactly as though I were making a real lasagna.

Great!  However you could us Ricotta in place of cottage cheese and cream cheese.  Try whipping  one or two raw eggs in the ricotta

Similar to what I make... But I don't use any cottage cheese or sour cream. I use a can of pizza sauce w/my spaghetti sauce and ground beef; layer that with the noodles and mozzarella cheese... A favorite here.

This was a very good base recipe. I had a very large container of spaghetti and meatballs that I really needed to use up before it went bad. The spaghetti noodles, (homemade) meatballs, and sauce were already mixed together. I separated out the noodles as best as I could and added a little extra sauce (cause hubby & son do not like "dry" red sauce). I used the noodles as the base Then i spread the cottage cheese/sour cream mixtures over the top.  Next, I topped this with the meatballs (and whatever spaghetti stuck to it). Then I topped with Italian Cheese Blend. Baked 30 minutes covered then 10-15 minutes uncovered. This was super-delicious and a fabulous way to truly use up leftover spaghetti (and meatballs).
