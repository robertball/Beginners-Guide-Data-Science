I liked the taste of the salmon but the stuff is very salty. I would recommend rinsing it off of maybe using less. salmon.  Adding the egg yolks to the mixture also helped

great way to make my smoked salmon stretch. I feel like i needed a bit more seasoning. I followed the recipe to a T. It still taste good, perfect for breakfast.
