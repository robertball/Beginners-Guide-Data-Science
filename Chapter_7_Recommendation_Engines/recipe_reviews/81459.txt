This was a very nice appetizer. I added more seasonings to the mixture including garlic and onion powders. To make life a bit easier, instead of making the toast cups, I used the mini phyllo cups. I'll definitely be making this again and I may even add some spinach to the mushroom filling. They were gone in no time and I thank you for submitting the recipe!

As written, these were very tasty, but a little bit of minced garlic made them really outstanding. I loved the munchy little toast cups - a nice change from the usual biscuit dough. Thanks!

I made the basic recipe and threw in a hand full of fresh spinach leaves at the end of sauteing the mushroom onion mixture. I didn't have time to make the toast cups, so to cut down on time I used the Athens Phyllo cups and stuffed them right before baking. This had spectacular flavor with a little bit of garlic added and a healthy dose of grated parmesan on top.

these were easy to make, the flavour was a little flat, maybe will try some garlic in with the mushrooms and onions next time. They looked great when they were finished, I will use them at our next dinner party.

I have been making a similar recipe for years, but found that brushing melted butter in the tins and over the tops of the bread circles make them crisp up nicely. Also, omitting the lemon juice and adding Marsala or sherry instead seems to complement the half and half.  If you double the recipe, don't double the cayenne!

The toast cups were very bland and did nothing to blend with the flavours of the mushroom filling, they each kind of stood out on their own. I think they needed something added to bind the flavours of the filling with the plainness of the toast cups better. The mushroom filling needed 2-3X more seasoning, lots more salt, and more flour than called for in the recipe to make it thick enough.  Overall the flavours were very nice with the extra tweaking, the addition of the Parmeson on top was very nice too.

D-licious...have been making a similar recipe for years but with a ground beef/mushroom filling.  Always gets rave reviews, and many requests for the recipe.

Definately add some garlic, and the reviewer that said add spinach was really on to something.

These need more flavor. Next time I will add some garlic and some other seasonings.

These were very good I'll definitely make again.  The only changes I did to the recipe was I used a sliced french bread loaf instead of white bread and I didn't  have half and half so I just used milk mixed with butter to make the "gravy".
