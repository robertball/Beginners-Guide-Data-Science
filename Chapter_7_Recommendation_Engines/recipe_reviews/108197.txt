Thank you for such a versitile and very delicious recipe!  I had two large butterfly pork chops, so I halved all of the liquid and only used a couple of shots of beer (thanks previous reviewers).  I also subbed several tablespoons of a prepared jerk seasoning in place of the list of jerk spices.  Smelled soooo good on the grill, and I loved the light carmelization from the molasses and rum, balanced by the saltiness of the soy sauce.  Will definitely use this one again!

This came out really nice. I can't imagine the problems that the other reviews had unless they did not follow the recipe.

Made this recipe for the Labor Day BBQ.  Everyone loved it!  Next time, I'll try it on chicken.

FABULOUS!  I love the infusion of flavors that brought this dish together.  As mixing, I was skeptical! Once I poured over the chops, the aroma, I knew it was going to be delightful. I cut down on the Rum and used a ginger puree.  I cut down too on the nutmeg and cinnamon (I was only using 4 chops).  I used Red Stripe Lager (Jamaican Beer). My family was loving this and asked for me to make it again.  I only marinaded this for about 7 hours though.  It would be fantastic if used with Chicken or on Ribs (as another reviewer stated). Thank you so much for sharing....

Great marinade! Everybody in my family enjoyed this recipe. I didn`t use molasses for marinade. If you don`t have a grill, fry the meat on a pan and you`ll get wonderful chops.

If you find the alocohol taste overpowering, marinate for MUCH less time, I make my own version, and only marinate for no more than a couple of hours

Made this on Friday night for a family dinner. Very, very good! The lime was not overpowering at all and yeah, you couldn't really taste the beer or rum but I don't think the point of the recipe was to taste those two ingredients. The combination of everything though is really tasty!
I had to shop for some of the spices which I didn't already have, so now I have to figure out what to do with them!

I did half the recipe for four loin chops and it was the perfect amount. We used our favorite Yuengling Lager in the marinade. I was concerned when one review said the alcohol was over powering, but we didn't taste the alcohol at all. I did detect the subtle flavoring from the spices and the sweetness and little spicy kick, all came together quite well, and the meat was tender and very juicy for pork. The only change I made was dried marjoram spice instead of fresh, and couldn't find a scotch bonnet pepper, so used a small jalapeno from my garden.

I used a Pork Tenderloin instead of chops. The alcohol taste was a bit over powering. The marinade could have done with much more chilli and a touch more sweetness. My husband liked it more than I did.

The recipe sounded great; but all we could taste was lime.   I would definately cut it down by half.  Did not taste much in the way of spices, or the beer/rum for that matter.  Maybe if I cut the lime down a bit, I could have tasted all the other flavors.

Wonderful and oh so spicy!!!  I will use this over and over - I love good Jerk rubs and marinades.  I didn't change anything although I used this on ribs rather than chops as the submitter suggested.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect...wish I would have doubled the recipe, it was that good! Used fresh scotch bonnets from our garden, they are difficult to find in a store.

I did not have dark rum so I used Bacardi clear and I could not find a Scotch bonnet pepper so I substituted a jalapeno.  Next time I will look for both ahead of time.  Nevertheless the flavor was amazing!

I really like the different taste this gives pork.  I am gluten intolerant so I substituted the beer for Strongbow Artisanal Blend Hard Cider.  I also did not have fresh herbs so I used dry spices instead.  Also did not have the kind of pepper it required so I just cut up a fresh medium hot pepper.  Cooked the pork chops on a charcoal smoker grill with a little wood added to give it that special smoked flavor.  Really enjoyed this recipe!  Thumbs up on this one.

Very flavorful. The smokiness of the grill really brought out the different elements of the marinade.

I was so excited to try this recipe as I have looked for years for a good Jamaican Jerk recipe.  I had a fresh pork tenderloin, followed the recipe exactly, let it marinade over night and all day today.  I sliced the tenderloin in 1"- 11/2" slices and grilled them.  It was so bad that we all took one bite and did not eat the meat.  It did not taste like any jerk meals I have had throughout the Caribbean and we were very disappointed.

I made this mostly according to the ingredients.  I didn’t have any beer, and only used Bacardi rum as it was what I had on hand.  I did increase the fresh herbs and the garlic a bit and added the zest of one lime as well.  I marinated 2pork t-loins for about 6 hrs., and it came out fantastic! Everyone, loved it!

We loved this!  I did not have the scotch bonnet pepper, so I substituted it with crushed red pepper.   Otherwise, I made it exactly as written.   I will make it again.

This marinade is perfect-sweet, rich, tangy, complex! I let them marinate for 2 days and then I cooked them up with some plums and it was seriously the best pork chop I've ever had!

Made this and made a few changes. Used Guiness beer, dropped the rum, used a little Chilli powder to replace the  fresh peppers. Used Himalayan sea salt and ground pepper. It was great, will make again.

I made this last night for dinner. First I don't have a broiler pan and I wanted the smokey flavor from the grill so I mixed up the marinade and slice 3 chicken breasts in half and marinated them overnight. I didn't have any mace so I added some ground mustard seasoned salt. I grilled them and served in warmed pita pockets with onion, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, and the sauce. For the sauce I added some dill weed and seasoned salt and just a touch of mint. My family LOVED this and requested I make it again.
