I had such high hopes for this recipe.  Sadly it didn't measure up to the wonderful aroma it produced.  Difficult to plate and the chicken itself didn't have much taste.  The sauce which I made into a gravy was good.  As a whole, it was just OK for us.  Thanks for the recipe - I am glad I tried it, but probably won't make it again.

After reading the other reviews, I tried to forestall the blandness with seasoned pepper and garlic powder, in addition to some salt. It was still flavorless. The other mystery is the 5-hour baking time; the breasts and thighs were done in 2-1/2 hours. There's plenty of juice, so maybe I'll try the author's suggestion of adding some chicken bouillon for a gravy; it can't hurt.

This was pretty good. I added potatoes to the roaster and some extra spices. I didn't need to add any liquid or baste. I used a whole fryer chicken and it was perfect at about 4.5 hours.

I have made this several times, with a few tweaks of course. I add celery seed, carrots, and chicken stock instead of water. I also omit the brown sauce. The last two hours I add potatoes and switch out fresh carrots. I sometimes also add Italian seasoning. If it still seems bland add an extra bouillon cube ;)
