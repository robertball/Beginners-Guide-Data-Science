This ended up being a HUGE dessert hit for Thanksgiving!!  It was my first time actually making a cheesecake from scratch, so I was a little nervous but needless to say it was so good.  My dad even loved it and he does not like nuts on desserts at all. The only variation that I made to this recipe is that I toasted the pecans. I think toasted nuts makes such a big impact on the flavor. This is a keeper for sure...

I just made this cheesecake for the first time today, and it was absolutely delicious!! I really like pralines anyway, so this cheesecake was especially tasty with the praline topping.
