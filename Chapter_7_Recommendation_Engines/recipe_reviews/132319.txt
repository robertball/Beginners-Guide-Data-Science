Amazing! ... If you like the sweeter version of classic challah. After all, who doesn't like the sound of more sugar? But if I could change one thing, don't let it rise too long otherwise the bread will lose its shape and turn into a blob of dough.

Tastes really good.  I'm not very adept at braiding limp dough, so it looked odd.  It does freeze well, though, so you could make it up ahead.

Used a lot less flour, maybe 2 1/2 cups less, just couldn't work it all in. Delicious, sweet, fairly easy to make! Thanks for sharing!

I made this challah for the holidays and it was a big hit with my family! I should mention that I rarely make challah because it never really comes out well for me and seems like a lot of effort for poor results. But this challah wasn't hard to make and came out exactly as I like it- firm and sweet! The family ignored the store bought challah and devoured this one! Thanks for the recipe!

i loved it! Made it for a friend who loves sweet challah bread. I had to double wrap them once they cooled to stop from 'taste testing'. Thank you Superreb

Really great rich, sweet challah. I used canola oil, and it was wonderful, when I used olive oil it didn't come out as good. Add chocolate chips for some variety

I used my KitchenAid Mixer with the dough hook attachment to make this dough.  I ended up using a ton more flour than the recipe stated-- the dough was very sticky.  I also added honey to the dough and to the glaze.  This gave me 4 challahs, so I froze two of the loaves for next week!  enjoy!

This was a huge hit! And it worked out wonderfully!

For being the first bread I've ever made, it came out absolutely incredibly. I'm super thrilled with it.

I brought a loaf to my local knit night and it was nearly gone by the time we broke for the night. All the ladies loved it!

Compliments, compliments, compliments.  My guests state the most moist, delicious, and sweetest challah they've had.  I coat it with poppy seeds or with sesame seeds.  Delicious.  Only recipe I use now.  Thank you for sharing.

This is my go-to challah recipe. I really want to branch out and try others, but I get so many compliments on this one. I usually make my challah loaves a bit smaller, so I can get at least 6 out of this batch.

I made this the first time for a dinner party and it was a hit. I almost wish I kept a kosher kitchen so I could see what my friends at temple would think. I love this recipe but it is a lot of bread. I tried halving the recipe at the beginning of this but I had some trouble remembering to halve everything and just ended up making a full batch to cover my mistakes.  Each time I make this recipe I have a hard time incorporating  the flour but this probably wouldn’t be a problem if you have a stand mixer.

Seems like a great recipe but baking for 30 minutes creates a taste like unbaked dough.  Not sure how much more it should bake, but that's not enough.

This is the best challah bread that I have ever made. I am an experienced bread baker, and this recipe tops every other challah. It is very sweet (which is what I was looking for and other challahs lack), and when I first made it, I couldn’t stop eating it. The only note that I have is that I used one cup less flour than recommended.  Great for French toast.

It looked very good but it didn’t taste good.  I am not a bread baker usually so the failure could be on my end, but I ended up throwing this in the bin because even the dogs wouldn’t eat it.

I swapped the cup of sugar for a cup of honey, and put honey in the glaze. Would definitely recommend. The taste is strong, and it's a more dessert-y bread but amazing for french toast after shabbat. It's not quite as eggy as the challah I get at the local bakery, but that's easily fixed by adding an extra egg yolk.

Turned out amazing! I wish I had risen and proofed it a tad longer than it suggested but it also rose plenty during baking. The bottom was a tad overdone but that was because I had all four in my oven at once so air circulation could have been better, and I left it in a few minutes longer to achieve better colour on the top.

Instead of vegetable oil I used a light olive oil. The dough was really sticky so I added more flour until it was the right consistency. Next time I may use 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 all purpose flour. I also made 2 loafs of 6 strand braided instead of 4 loafs of 3 strand. It was two feet long so next time I will cut it into three loafs of 6 strand and see how that goes. The bread was sweet, but not too sweet.

Update....
I made this challah again, but used bread flour instead of all purpose. The dough was less sticky, used less flour during the kneeling process which resulted in a lighter and better loaf. I recommend using bread flour. I used Lillys brand because King Auther was too expensive. 
Also I made 4 loaves of 6 strand braided. They were perfect sizes and were beautiful!

This recipe is great. Thexhallah always tastes amazing. Super sweet. I've made this recipe so many times ... I find that I do need to use more  flour then the recipe calls for.

This is delicious! My husband said he could eat an entire loaf! I ran out of vegetable oil and used what I had left and olive oil and it came out fine. I had trouble getting it to rise (my yeast may have been too old or was it the olive oil?) and put a pot of hot water under the  bowl of rising dough with a towel over it. This got it to rise. 
My only suggestion: the original recipe doesn't say this yields four loaves. I think all recipes should have a yield. Now I have four loaves of dangerously delicious, cake-like bread in my house! Somehow, we will survive. :)
