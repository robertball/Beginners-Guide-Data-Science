Great dish with ingredients that surprisingly blended together very nicely. The one adjustment I made, since we couldn't grill tonight, was slice the chicken prior to marinating, then pan-cooked the chicken. It was very flavorful. Thank you for this recipe - we'll enjoy it again!

The chicken came out nice with a very interesting flavor. I sauteed the chicken and it was very flavorful.

This was very delicious.  Believe it or not, I accidentally bought two grapefruit instead of two oranges.  It was a rewarding accident.  I recommend trying it this way, too.

I thought the sauce failed as a dressing ... I couldn't eat the salad.  I think it had something to do with the mixture raw garlic, orange and cumin.  Basically, it barely stuck to the leaves, except the garlic stuck really well and it was just too strong.  Otherwise, the chicken was fine.  Not really a strong orange flavor, but it's good.

Was okay.  It marinated for a day or two, but I just found the flavor kind of blah and a little dry due to the acidic juices, maybe. Probably won't use this one again.

This recipe was okay but I probably won't make it again.  I read reviews from others and added avacado as suggested, which was good.  I would definitely suggest making at least twice the amount of dressing.  there isn't enough to both marinate the chicken and dress the salad.

I had leftover chicken (Key West Chicken from this site) and I wanted to put it in a salad, so I used the marinade as a dressing - it was fresh and interesting! Really great. I'll try the full recipe next time.

If you like avocados, you have to try them in this salad!  The salad dressing is a perfect flavor match and pouring it over the sliced avocados before tossing the salad keeps them from turning brown.

This was really good...the only changes I made were: 
I used sweet red onion in place of the green onion (I didn't have any) and I tossed in a few black beans that were sitting in the fridge (waste not want not!) 
It was wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was good, the marinade/dressing was perfect for the chicken. I ended up adding a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and turning the rest of the dressing into a vinaigrette, that made it milder and made it stick to the salad more. I added some cherry tomatoes and an avocado.

I'm giving it a 4 because the chicken was great but the salad was just okay.  The directions say to split the marinade so you save 1/2 for the dressing.  There's where the problem lies.  It makes a great marinade but a watery bla dressing.  I added some oil because what's dressing without SOME oil.  It was better but it still just tasted like juice.  If you are one to like a squeeze of juice on a salad, then you may like this.  My husband liked it even less than I did.  Also, the salad lacked color for me to I added red bell pepper and slivered carrots.  Sorry, I won't be making this salad again, but I'll keep the recipe for the marinade.

First of it all, this was very, very good!  However, I did not taste any orange flavor at all.  I really only tasted the chili powder, cumin, and garlic (which are all great flavors).  I even marinated the chicken for about 4 hours, thinking that the flavors would be more pronounced, but that didn't happen.  I used honey instead of white sugar and added some olive oil.  I will definitely add salt next time; I thought about it this time, but my dad has high blood pressure, so I didn't. But, I always like to use a pinch of salt in everything.  I will make it again, but make some changes next time.

I added cilantro and yellow pepper. The cumin flavor was a bit too much for me. It took a while to adjust to the flavor, but by the 5th or 6th bite it was ok.
