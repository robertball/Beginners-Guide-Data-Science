Excellent as written!  I lighten it up further by omitting the olive oil or at least use much less and skip the salt.  Another option is to add finely chopped celery to the mix.  Serve in a scooped out fresh tomato in season or half an avocado for a lovely salad for lunch or dinner.  I eat year round and always well received when served to guests.  If you love tuna, this is worth a try!  If not fond of tuna, sub in diced chicken or turkey.

Delicious & healthy, as are all Mediterranean dishes.  Much tastier than tuna w/mayo.  The olive oil really elevates the flavors.  I used 2 cans of Italian tuna packed in olive oil, so I omitted the additional oil in this recipe.  I also added a sprinkle of oregano.  Very, very tasty.

OMG...This was soooo good! Thsis is my first review as I normally dont do them!!I made it exactly as described minus the fresh parsley because I did not have it at home.
You can do SO MUCH with this recipe.....You could add any ingredient you want to  change it up to your liking. Examples: Add celery, humus, olives, tomatoes, mushroom beans & much more. You could eat it with salad, wraps, toast, sandwich, lettuce wraps  or straight up as I did! You could add or delete ingredients as you like. Examples: add orange zest, grapefruit zest or leave it out. You could add honey, avocado, hot sauce, left over shredded chicken or any meats.  You can add or delete anything you want to this recipe! Thank you to who ever posted it!

I liked it by my wife really wanted some mayo and pickles. I think I will experiment using a bit of avocado mayo, dill pickles, and perhaps some fresh cucumber or celery. The lemon zest definitely adds a great dimension to the traditional tuna salad.

I think I like regular (mayo) tuna salad better, BUT this gets 5 stars for being super easy to make, tasty, healthier, and very inexpensive (all items easily on hand, esp if you are ok with dried parsley as I was). I served it on romaine lettuce leaves and found it very refreshing and a nice change of pace. Thanks for the new recipe in my rotation!

Yogurt instead of mayo 
I'm allergic to eggs. And mayo is made of eggs in majority.

Completely forgot about this until I saw this recipe, so I made it like I remember from my childhood (very similar).

Mom used to make this when I was younger. The only differences: She added diced, fresh tomatoes and served with pita bread.

I never would have thought of this. I just finished some tuna with mayo. Yours sounds great and I know I'll like it because it has all of my favorite ingredients. I like to use solid white tuna and this will keep it moist but healthy.
