This really is refreshing and a good palate cleanser. No one flavor is overpowering, they all blend well, and it is just a nice light-tasting salad. I used pre-shredded carrots and chopped up a fair amount of cilantro. Mixed/tossed rather than layered the salad. I do wonder whether it might have been a little easier to eat if I had followed the recipe and shaved the carrots myself. The store bought carrot shreds were more like matchsticks and were a little hard to pick up. Thanks!

Not dazzled but a nice refreshing summer salad. Did not use escarole. Should have cut the jicama and carrots shorter- awkward to eat. This was even better as leftovers.

This is a pleasant salad with a lot of possibilities.  As written, I probably wouldn't make it again. The apple cider vinegar vinegar tasted rather harsh. I may try again with either lemon juice or white wine vinegar.  I'd also add a little bit of olive oil or a nut oil to enhance the absorption of vitamins and minerals and won't drain the carrots after marinating.
