very good and easy to make.  I used half and half instead of whipping cream.  I had fresh tomatoes from the farm.  I will be making this again.  Thanks

Everyone loved this soup. I did substitute vegetable broth for 1/2 of the chicken stock.

excellent soup especially for what I have in my garden. i didnt quite puree it, so it was a little thicker, but it was good. i used someone's suggestion and added some more sauteed zucchini, after blending the soup, that i set aside from earlier, for some chunkiness. also used light cream rather than heavy, it was delicious. and its got a nice spicy kick from the red pepper. will make again.

This soup is wonderful.  I did make a few minor changes.  I added more plum tomatoes than indicated in the recipe, used light cream, and added chopped zucchini at the very end to add a little crunch to the soup.  The pepper flakes were more aggressive than we would have liked even though I used less than was indicated, so adjust to your own tastes.  This was very enjoyable and an excellent use of veggies from the garden.

I really enjoyed this recipe and pretty much made it as written.  I used canned whole tomatoes. The soup was very flavorful which is great.  The only thing that I did differently was saut√©ed up an extra zucchini to add into the soup before I ate it.  I look forward to making this soup again.

This was exceptional and helped me get rid of garden tomatoes that are in abundance (even giving away). I have to say that we are big meat smokers in our house and I added some leftover smoked pork to this recipe exactly as written. Thank you thank you thank you.
