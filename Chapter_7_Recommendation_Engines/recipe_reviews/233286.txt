This was delicious!  Very refreshing for summer.  I topped each glass off with a splash of Sprite. The berries soaked overnight and have great drink a light pink color.

This was awesome and easy to make! Loved the lemonade flavor with the berries. I did use a few fresh strawberries flash frozen and they didn't break down to mush like the frozen berries. I let it sit overnight and everyone loved it!
