Great basic recipe for a tuna/veggie mix, which I serve IN pita halves... going for a different flavor I dice standard pimento olives, fresh garlic, tomato strips (drained well), green leaf lettuce, smoked paprika, season salt, fresh pepper, radish & onions (julienne/thin strips)... split the lite mayo with fat free sour cream and I have yet to use 'steak seasoning' (?), but I often add Sriracha for guys watching football games ... but hey, this is a "make to taste" sandwich... play with it and please yourself! I slap extra sharp shredded cheese (you pick one) and sour cream on top to serve... Oh, 1/2 cup mustard make a different deal a together and in my mind negates the tuna. This cannot be "juicy" or it will melt the pita halves. ENJOY!!
