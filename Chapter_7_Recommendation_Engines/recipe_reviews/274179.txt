I halved the recipe as a test for just the two of us.  I baked it right away and it was delicious.  And, the leftovers were also excellent!

This was a delicious recipe! I used fresh peaches -- sliced them up, placed slices into a pot with some sugar and a bit of water, and made my own cooked peaches with syrup :)  I sprinkled the brown sugar over the top of the casserole after adding the warmed butter. Served with additional maple syrup, although it definitely could have stood on its own! Thanks for the recipe!

This was such a simple and delicious recipe! I did add 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg to the milk mixture and I used about 3/4 cup chopped pecans and a 1/4 cup brown sugar for the topping. I served it with maple syrup and whipped cream and it was amazing!
