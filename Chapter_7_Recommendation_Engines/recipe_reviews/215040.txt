Loved it! Was unsure about the use of vinegar vs lime juice, but the combination with the sweetness of the watermelon was very tasty. I used red onion instead of white, and added some red/green pepper. The amount of liquid is a lot even though I let the chopped watermelon drain in a colander. Will make again and use a slotted spoon for serving.

Very unique!  I had left over watermelon and found this recipe. I had nothing to lose and wanted something different to do with watermelon.  This is absolutely delicious.  I took it to work and some were hesitant but once they tried it they kept coming back for more.  I will be making this more often...thanks!

This is GREAT stuff!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use white balsamic vinegar because I ran out of my white wine vinegar.  It is spectacular!  My daughter and I scarfed it down in no time!  You won't be sorry to make this!  Thanks for the recipe!

It was veryy healthy and pretty, but bland...maybe more garlic and herbs would help?  Will make again with more spices.

Delicious! My new go-to summer salsa recipe. I didn't have a jalapeño on hand so the salsa was very mild, but still tasty. I halved the recipe using 1/3 c. of vinegar and purple onion. Our family of five finished it off in one setting.

I typically don’t use jalapeños in salsas to match my husband’s taste, but considering a seeded jalapeño.    I added lime and more salt to taste.

Delicious.  I grilled Tilapia and fresh pineapple.  Served with sweet corn on the cob.  Great light summer meal.
