A little on the dry side, I'll use more applesauce next time, but all together good when you add the butter and honey!  I did take the advice given and cut the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. instead of the 2 tsp. it called for.

My family and i thought this was really good. But i did take other peoples advice and cut back on the baking soda. I also added a little more applesauce and sugar and it was great. I will definately be making this again.

I should definitely have read the reviews before I made this. Threw the whole thing out after one taste...all I could taste was baking soda. I do believe there is an error in the amount.

I love love this corn bread. I read some of the other reviews before I made it. They said it was a little bit on the dry side and too much baking soda. So, I doubled the apple sauce and added a 1/4 cup of butter to the recipe. I also cut the baking soda in half. I had some fresh oregano and marjoram I chopped up and added about a teaspoon to it. Yummy!!! This is my favorite. The secret to good corn bread is to not let it bake too long. If it's starting to turn brown and the tooth pick comes out clean pull it out.

As is, this recipe is not very good.  Too much baking soda -- the bitterness is terrible.  Switch to self-rising flour and cornmeal and it becomes much better -- rating at least a 3 and a half.

Unfortunately, we took one bite and discarded the remainder, very disappointing.  Curiously, this tasted and smelled like fish.

Without the sugar it does not taste sweet if you prefer it that way. It is moist and easy

Not that great, sorry. Thought the applesauce would make it more moist, but it wasn't that moist.  Ok flavor but that amusement park cornbread recipe on her is a million times better.  I will admit that I doubled this recipe and made into mini-muffins for a chili supper, which maybe effected it moistness and texture - might have been better baked in just 8X8 pan.

I made this for my family and it was a huge hit.  One of the men said it was the best cornbread he'd ever had, my husband said it was fantastic.  To me it was a touch on the dry side, but I suppose that's just the nature of cornbread.  This would also be a wonderful breakfast item, perhaps drizzled with maple syrup or honey.  My husband's first thought, being a true Southerner, was sausage gravy.  lol  Long story short, this is a great recipe, and nice and simple.  No fuss, no muss, just a delicious cornbread.

I liked this. Let's face it, if you don't use fat, it's not going to have the same consistency of normal cornbread.  However, if you know that going in and you're looking for a lower fat alternative to it, give this recipe a shot.  I didn't make as is.  Here are the changes I made:  used one and a half teaspoons baking soda; used whole wheat flour; added about a third of a cup of fat free plain Greek yogurt; used egg whites.  I tried very hard to not stir the mixture too much.  It rose nicely and I ended up with a palatable quick bread that went well with the veggie soup I concocted that night.  My 14 year old son really liked it and remarked how it didn't crumble (and wasn't as messy) as regular cornbread.  In fact, he ended up eating 3/4 of the pan, that little turkey!

Only use 1/2 tsp baking soda and double the applesauce. Watch cooking time so it does not get overdone. Will be perfect!!

I left this in the oven for an additional 15 minutes on top of the said cooking time and it still was not cooked all the way through.  I thought we'd try it anyway and cut off the part that wasn't done.  This recipe was not appealing at all, it had a very funky taste and none of us could even finish our first bite.  I compared this to my usual trusty cornbread recipe and discovered that this one has four times the amount of baking soda.  I will be altering my usual recipe to accommodate the apple sauce and will not be attempting this one again.

my mom and i made this recipe, and we just added 3tsp. of butter, and a whole cup of cinnamon applesauce instead of no butter and 1/4 cup applesauce. we also just buttered the pan.  We tested it out on my little brothers and told them to eat it normally (with butter and honey), and they Loved it!!! :) :)
     P.S. I loved it too :)

I took the advice of all the reviewers and reduced the baking soda to 1 tsp and increased the applesauce to 1/2 cup.   Admittedly, I have a taste preference for sweeter cornbread, so in the future, I would add some honey.  With these modifications, this rose well and was plenty moist.
