Made it just like the recipe. I will make it again. Might add cooked bacon or sausage for a complete breakfast casserole. Yummy!!!

Made a full batch because of the pie crust for just my husband and I. Cut into 6 servings which my husband ate a full one and I ate about 2/3rds both of us had a mixed green salad with. Definitely going into rotation but will skip the pie crust (as one previous reviewer did) and cut in half. Did not make any changes other than shredding the zucchini and carrot instead of slicing. Yeah a big veggie meal for me (I have a hard time getting my vegetable servings in).

I loved this! Only change I made was I did not use a pie crust. I just made the filling and baked it in a shallow baking dish. Delish!

Made it without the pie crust. Very tasty dish.
