Yum!  This was really delicious.  I followed the recipe except to add half golden raisins and half chopped dates.  I would probably omit some of the oil next time but other than that the taste was terrific.  I also may switch almond for the pinenuts too.  I served this with Tandoori chicken and cucumber, tomato and yogurt salada with cilantro and mint.
Thanks for a yummy recipe.

I used whole wheat couscous from Trader Joe's. I used half the oil called for (3 T rather than 6 T in the recipe) and I thought it was plenty. I didn't use any fancy spices -- just plain old cinnamon, pepper, and red pepper. The combination of things sounds strange, but it is subtle and wonderful and blends together nicely.  I took it to a potluck and 4 out of the 6 women asked for the recipe.  The other two loved it, but they don't cook!

I don't generally like couscous but wanted to try this for my new husband who does. I tasted it immediately after putting all the ingredients together and it was fantastic! I couldn't stop "tasting" it and by the time he got home from work, I'd eaten at least one serving! It is easy, and oh so delicious!!! Please try it!

Wow, this was good!  It has an interesting mix of textures and flavors and can be served either cold or at room temperature.  It tastes light, but it sticks with you, so that it makes a nice lunchtime salad.  Chopping the dates was a nuisance (the only chopped dates I could find had added sugar), but was ultimately worth it for the final result.  Next time I'll try making it with whole wheat couscous to make it even healthier.

This is the perfect side dish. Goes with anything. Has a pleasant sweet taste from the dates. Do not use raisins. Raisins way to sweet. Follow the recipe exactly. Dont have to use the recommend Mccormick stuff.   All the ingredients work perfectly together if you follow it exactly.

I can't believe how good this was!  I used two small boxes of couscous with pine nuts already in it - it came out to 11 oz, so I added a tablespoon of water to the chicken broth when cooking.  I also added two tablespoons vinegar and four tablespoons olive oil to the mix so it wouldn't be dry.  It was excellent!  I did not use the McCormick spices indicated - most of mine were generic and it didn't make a difference.  With some bread, this made a full vegetarian meal for us - Both of us loved it and will definitely make again. UPDATED TO ADD - I'VE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS NOW - I NOW SUBSTITUTE QUINOA FOR THE COUS COUS TO MAKE IT EVEN HEALTHIER AND IT IS WONDERFUL - I ALSO USE CRAISINS INSTEAD OF DATES SINCE IT'S EASIER - STILL LOVE THIS RECIPE.

This is very very yummy with a Tunisian flavor! I'm always looking for recipes from the Middle East.  This one is at the top!  All the different flavors blend surprisingly wonderful together. :)

This is a fantastic recipe. It is also very yummy with chunks of apple, and I prefer raisins to dates.

This has become a favorite for me and my husband we eat it almost once a week! It tastes wonderful and it is a great way to get more fiber in your diet. I like to add just a touch of rice vinegar to give it a little more tang.

Oh my gosh was this good.  I love the Sutton Gourmet's Couscous salad on their salad bar (which I think they've discontinued) and have been trying to replicate it.  This was so good and easy to make.  I like cinnamon so I added a little more and my neigbhor thought it was a little too much (but I thought it was perfect).  I also added some saffron which i have to admit I could not tell the difference once I added it (I infused it in hot water and then added it becuase I didn't have it when I made it).  The different flavors with the sweet, onion, nuts, was a great mixture of flavors.  I decreased the olive oil some just to cut down on the fat and it didn't make any difference.  Wonderful!

This was unusual and delicious. I love dates but rarely see main course recipes with them - so I couldn't wait to try this. What a great vegetarian meal. I only used half the olive oil and thought it was still moist and flavorful. I was surprised how quick and easy it was to whip up too because the ingredient list seems long, but it does come together in just 30 minutes and is well worth the effort. The leftovers are great cold too!

I thought this was fabulous! I must admit I was a little hesitant at first, but the flavors all work very well together. The only thing I did differently was instead of the white wine vinegar I used all rice vinegar as that is what I had, but it was still excellent!

It's pretty good - waaaay too many raisins rhough.  I used half of what it called for, and still found that to be too much.  And I do like raisins.

Really great flavor, kind of moroccan.  I used raisins instead and used bulgar in place of the couscous.  Great warm or cold.

This is an absolutely FANTASTIC salad.  I'd never made anything with chickpeas or couscous before, but I found this recipe for a Mediterranean-themed potluck and it was a huge hit!  I didn't have red pepper or cilantro, used only one shredded carrot, and substituted cider vinegar for the white wine vinegar and it was still delicious.  The mix of flavors is amazing and the cinnamon really comes through.  Very simple to put together, too.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Love this salad! I took the advice of another review and used raisins instead of dates (didn't have to chop them) and forgot to toast the pine nuts. With these little changes  it saved some time. The combination of flavors is like a true comfort food!

This was so good!  I wouldn't change anything.  The cilantro is a wonderful addition! My family loved it and I'm choosing this recipe to cater a group and serving it with turkey tenderloins seasoned with the ingredients in Simple Whole Roasted Chicken off this site-it has cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, etc.  A perfect compliment to this dish!
I did not have the McCormick collection spices used in this recipe and was still wonderful.

as written, a bit bland.  Had to add more cinnamon and allspice.  Used rice vinegar for its mild flavor, but it just did not blend very well w/the couscous.  Added more lemon juice and grated lemon zest.  This improved the flavor.  Also added more scallion and the above helped.  North African dishes usually use lemon juice for tartness.  Pine nuts did add to the dish, but still needed 'something'.  Served this at a july 4th picnic, and had both Moroccan and Tunisians at the table.  I think the jury is still out on their opinion of the dish.   I am glad I tried this recipe, but would probably not make again.

This salad is fantastic, really yummy. I also used less olive oil in the dressing - 4 tablespoons and replaced half the dates with raisins.

I needed a quick easy side dish that would add an minimum of heat to my already warm house.  I made this with (like most people who review on here) a few changes.  I didn't have wine vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar.  I also added almonds instead of pine nuts, and crasins instead of dates.  I was out of green onions so I did white dried onions and put them in with the couscous. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of curry powder.  It is delicous!  I keep "tasting" it.  My two year old loves it as well!

Such an easy recipe - and full of flavour!  The cinnamon and dates blend so well with the green onions and chickpeas!  One of my family favorites!  :)

This is wonderful and I have made it several times.  Most recently, to make it gluten free,  I used 1 cup quinoa instead of the 10 oz of couscous and increased the stock to 2 cups.  I use red pepper flakes instead of ground red pepper and I think that keeps the spicy-ness manageable.  Like a lot of users, I also cut the olive oil in half.

Sooooo great and easy to make!  I replace the cranberries w/ raisins, just my personal taste, skip the carrots and add diced granny smith apples.  Great chilled, and it keeps well for leftovers for 3 days or so....

This was very good and very easy to make the only thing I would change is to cut the ground red pepper in half was a bit to spicy for me and I like spicy I think it just overpowered the other flavors.  I use Penzey spices and maybe the ground red pepper is stronger then the McCormicks I will need to look into that

I halved this recipe...used a 5.6 oz box of instant couscous w/pinenuts:) Also cut down the olive oil in the dressing(used equal parts vin. and oil).  I really enjoyed the salad....sweet, sour, and crunchy.  I will make this again!!!!

Recipe was a bit bland, you could certainly taste the inferior quality of the McCormick spices.  I tried it again with fresh peppers in a little bit of oil, and fresh cinnamon made this 4/5.   Stay away from McCormick, and you'll be fine.

I cut the fat considerable by using only 1.5 T of oil and adding the juice of 1 orange to keep it moist. It turned out well. I warm it before eating. Yummy!

Great recipe!!  I chopped the carrots instead of grating, which {I think) improves both the appearance and texture.
