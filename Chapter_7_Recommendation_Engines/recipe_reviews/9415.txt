This is almost exactly like my mother's recipe from the gas company cookbook. Except, what's with the 'rum extract'? Too politically correct for me! Mine calls for 3 tbls of real rum. In fact, I recall my mom sprinkling more rum on days later. She said the longer they sat, the better they were!!!

I really don't like to mix alcohol with sweets but my husband really wanted me to make these. Crashed everything in the food processor oh! And only had Malibu Coconut Rum (didn’t have regular) and the taste is unbelievable! I am hoping to hide them from my husband and wait a week for the flavor to incorporate! (Doubt they will “survive” with my husband around! :o) ) Great recipe. I will serve it at my upcoming Martini Party! UPDATE: I made them again and I mixed almonds instead of pecans (I confused them...don’t ask me why :(  ) and they are not bad...but definitely they are much better with pecans

I used 1 12oz. box of vanilla wafers and that was almost exactly 3 cups.  I used 3T. of real rum as one of the other reviewers stated and I felt the dough was a little wet, so next time I would use the same amount of rum and all of the crumbs from the 12oz. box of wafers to compensate.  We really enjoyed this and my husband had fun helping me make them!

I used all rum instead of the water and rum extract. Excellent!! If you do choose to use rum, make sure it's a good quality.  No cheaping out!

Great recipe. I made these for Christmas to put into tins and give away. They are alot better as they sit for a while. I used less cocoa powder. Only about 1 T. It's all that I had. They still tasted great.

These are great - 2 coworkers asked me for the recipe!  I kept them frozen and re-rolled them in powdered sugar right before serving.  Thanks for posting this!

This is a great basic recipe.  I tweaked it a bit and used: 1 box Nabisco Vanilla Wafers.  No generic works as well. 3 Tb Cocoa, 1 Cup Confect Sugar, 3 TB Light Corn Syrup and 1/3 cup Rum and 1 Tb Water.  I found this consistency great and moist to enough that I used a small ice cream scoop to shape.  Then I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper andd shifted Confect Sugar to cover the sheet.  Make my balls with the ice cream scoop and was able to fit one receipe per cookie sheet.  Then I shifted Confect Sugar over top to desired coverage.  It went so fast and tasted great.  Never had to touch the dough.  Then I put in frig for a few minutes and packed tins.  Age one week.  The longer they sit, the better.

I've never had rumballs before but knew I loved rum.

These were so easy to make - I was surprised.

I did use real Bacardi rum to make it and the food processor which made it super easy. I rolled mine in powdered sugar when first making and yes it was a bit sticky but eventually everything dries out. I stored mine in the fridge for 4 -5 days before serving and just rerolled them in powdered sugar before serving.  It has been 7 days now and they still taste fresh.  

**update** I made these for a cookie exchange and needed to double the recipe according to allrecipes button.  Since my processor wasn't large enough, I ground the nuts and nilla wafers in 2 batches.  Then stuck all that in a large bowl and then put the wet ingredients in and used a hand mixer to blend all together.

Perfect for a cookie exchange because they are so easy to make and yield alot.

These were easy to make and oh-so yummy. Keep your hands slightly moist when you roll the dough into balls and you won't have any problem with stickiness.

These turned out very well, but were toxically sweet.  Instinctually, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 of what the recipe called for, and they were still too sweet for my liking.  Given that you'd only eat 1 or 2 at a holiday gathering, they are ideal for a quick no-bake dessert to share with MANY others!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!!! Everyone who tried it loved it! Although I was not allowed to eat them myself, since they contain alcohol, I still enjoyed making them. I made them for my mothers birthday. I didn't make any major changes, except using my favorite nuts.

I used 1/4 cup Malibu (coconut rum) and added enough water to make 1/3 of a cup.  I also used 5T of corn syrup.  They haven't sat for a week yet, but they are still great!  I can't wait to eat the rest a week from now!

I made these last night for a function this coming Friday.  They smell great, but I won't know what they taste like until Friday.  I used rum extract as stated (only because I had some on hand).  Next time I may try the actual rum.  I followed the recipe.  Beware, it's a little messy to put into balls, even using a melon ball scooper.  The only thing I did differently was to mix all of my ingredients in a food processor.  I measured all of my ingredients and put them directly in the food processor.  So far, great recipe.

I LOVE rum balls during the holidays, but a. I think real rum should be used, and b. my mom used graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers, and I LOVED them made that way. Just some ideas...

I usually make a different rum ball recipe for Christmas that calls for walnuts, but I ran out so I looked for one with pecans.  As it turns out, I like them better this way!  This is now going to be the recipe I make for my cookie trays.  I always use Malibu rum for rum balls.  It just goes with the chocolate perfectly and it's not overpowering at all.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Awesome recipe!  Super easy, no bake, just a few basic ingredients.  Use a food processor for fast prep.  I followed other reviewers advice and used all rum, no water, no extract and it was perfect.  The first batch I took to the office for our annual cookie exchange and they were a hit. I just made a second batch for us at home and substituted 2 really ripe bananas for the corn syrup.  Deeeelicious!!  I'm going to try the coconut rum next time.  Hope you enjoy!

Sorry, but in my opinion (and my family's) these were not all that great. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I think real rum or bourbon would have made the difference, so I think I'll try that next time.

Excellant!!! Just tried these to add additional cookies to my gifts. very good.  I also did what another person recommended. Left out the water and used rum.  Just the taste I wanted. No rum flavoring here. The real thing. Back to the store for more ingredients to make more.  Happy holidays.

When I saw this recipe I thought - maybe this is the way Mom use to make her rum balls.  Unfortunately, it was not.  These were okay, but I would not make them again.

These are so good!  I thought they tasted better in week 2 than week 1.  A new tradition for my holiday treats. I made the balls about a 1/2 tablespoon size and got 67 balls.  UPDATE:  Instead of rum extract, I used 151 rum, about 5 tablespoons and added 8 extra tablespoons extra confectioners sugar.  According to an Internet search for subs I found this:  "For 1 teaspoon of rum extract, use 3 tablespoons of rum or season to taste. For a more specific general rule, the ratio of light rum will be closer to 4 tablespoons while dark rum requires less, closer to 2 tablespoons."

I just made these and they are delicious!  I used a spiced rum I purchased on my honeymoon in St. Lucia.  I can only imagine how wonderful they will taste in a few days.

These were the best rum balls we ever had!!!  Very moist and flavorful.  I added 3T. whiskey (that was what we had) instead of rum extract.

Use spiced rum in place of the extract. You won't regret it!

These are wonderful, shared them with friends and teachers. I used 1/4 cup honey instead of corn syrup mixed with the water. I did not have cocoa, and they were still excellent. I used 1/4 cup rum. They have sat for a week in the fridge....they only get better. Be sure to roll them in confectioners (again) sugar before serving.

Watch out, these are addicting!  My grandma used to make these when we were little and my family was thrilled to get them in their Christmas care packages.  They were easy and tasty and a huge hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't care for the taste or texture of these but some people in my office liked them.  I felt they were too doughy.

These are very good I added a little more extract. It seemed very wet but when iI got it all rolled in powdered sugar the were fine. They remind me of the younger days when mom made them every year. Cant wait for the days to pass. thank you for sharing this.

Yum! I could sit and eat these all day long. Quick to put together, but hard to wait the 5-7 days before you can eat them. Well worth the wait though. These will be added to my cookie list every christmas.

Really yummy and you'd never know this is based on nilla wafers.  Used brandy instead of rum for some of them.

Very good, I used Malibu coconut rum. Everyone liked them and they are much better if you wait a few days to eat them, if they last that long.

I haven't made a no bake cookie since Girl Scouts, so I was skeptical, however these were great. This recipe has become a favorite with my family and will be included with my annual Christmas baking.

I just finished making these, and although they taste good, I'm hoping the rum flavour will strengthen as they sit. I ended up tripling the rum extract content. Time will tell!

Simple , easy recipe. Made it using Karo Pancake Syrup.  Tasted one after a couple of days.  Didn't seem very rummy.  Made again a few days later.  Used GC crumbs, dark syrup.  Haven't tasted yet.  Plan to do again with bananas and Malibu Coconut Rum.

Just found this recipe.  Made it right away.  Soooo easy.  Made a couple substitutions.  Graham crumbs instead of vanilla wafers.  Dark corn syrup instead of light.  (only because those were what I had on hand).  I HAD to try one right away.  It already is delish!!!  My question is... how am I supposed to wait a whole week before having more???

These are very easy to make.  The taste was really good & was what I hoping for when I was searching for this recipe.  Reminds me of Christmas when I was young.  I plan to make these for the Christmas holiday season every year.  My only question is how is the best way to store these (refrigerated or not).
