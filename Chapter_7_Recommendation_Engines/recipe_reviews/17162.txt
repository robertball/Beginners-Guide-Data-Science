This is an excellent recipe. In fact I didn't remove the fennel seeds cause I like their crunch in the salad.Indians make a similar chutney in which they use the same spices and some white sugar& then cook the tomatoes till they are very soft but this tasted really different & good.Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent salad.  Great flavor combinations.  I have eated this with fish, chicken, and pork.  It makes an excellent side dish.

Thsi was a nice twist on an old favorite but it didnt "wow" me. I really liked the lime though. Next time, I think I will use crushed red pepper to get a stronger flavor. (I didn't remove the fennel seeds either) I laid it on a bed of curly parsley & garnished w/ minced onions. Wsa a nice side to Shrimp Burritos...thanks!
