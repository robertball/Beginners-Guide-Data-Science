Very tasty and easy! My family loved it. I used a onion and 1/2 green pepper. I also used 2 cans of chicken gravy instead of the packets. Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

I had a craving for lemon pepper but I wanted a recipe that was different and this one hit the spot.  I tried this recipe with a slight deviation, I used 1/2 green bell pepper, (I didn't have a red pepper) one roma tomato, 1 small onion, 1 package of chicken gravy mix worked for me, and I used a little fresh lime juice.  Very flavorful and great over rice!  My wife is taking leftovers for work tomorrow.  I'm sticking this recipe in my regular rotation!

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is so easy and very tasty.  I was a bit nervous of using lemon pepper and gravy but it was extremely good. I deviated from the recipe a bit by adding some onion when cooking the chicken and a bit of lemon juice.  I then sauteed the peppers with the chicken and onions before adding the gravy and simmering.

This was great! I wanted something different and had all the ingredients on hand. Simple and comes together easily. Looks great when served. I used frozen pepper strips that included yellow peppers. Thanks for sharing. I will make this one again.

I added maybe a 1/2 tsp of lemon zest to bring out the lemon flavor. Family loved it. Will recommend and make again.

this was absolutely fabulous!  I added a tablespoon or 2 of fresh lemon juice, mccormick california style garlic salt (lemon was suggestion of another review) but I also added some sliced almonds that I lightly toasted in the toaster oven.  they just were wonderful with the lemon and chicken.  I also added more lemon pepper.  but I essentially followed the recipe word for word and it was GREAT!!  for those that are gluten free-  I used maxwell's gluten free chicken gravy packets and it turned out great.

This was tasty! But I guess I didn't like the fact that the chicken tasted boiled.  Will make changes next time.

One word...WOW! My husband and I tweaked it a bit, we made our own chicken gravy (water, butter, flour, chicken bouillon) and it still came out amazing. Thanks for this recipe

Instant favorite! It fills the house with such a lovely aroma. Makes my mouth water. Although, I may do some things differently next time.

I basically followed this recipe to a T. I halved the chicken but kept the bell pepper amounts same. Only had one packet of gravy. 2 packets would've been nice but 1 is definitely enough!

The end result was a very light tasting treat compared to what I usually tend to cook. I served this with rice. My S/O is a cheese lover and I was really happy to find a recipe that he thought was delicious ... WITHOUT CHEESE! :) I did end up using a little bit of corn starch to speed up the thickening process, but altogether this is a great recipe and I will make it again. It's pretty inexpensive to prepare also!!

This was a nice change from the usual chicken and rice.   My husband and I enjoyed it, the kids not so much.  I added garlic and onions.

Loved this quick easy delicious recipe. I added a bunch of mushrooms and left out the red pepper bc that's what I had. I also only used one packet of gravy and had more than enough sauce. Yum, yum!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was nice and easy, and super good over rice!! I did use canned chicken gravy (2 cans) and replaced the green peppers with onion. I will be making it again.

This wasn't exactly bad, but it was definitely not what I was expecting. The sauce didn't really thicken for me which was disappointing, and it seemed a little bland.  I served this over rice and the end result looked and tasted very much like Chinese food. And don't get me wrong, I love Chinese food but for some reason that's not what I was expecting from this. I might try this again but there would definitely be some changes involved.

Very tasty recipe! I followed it exactly except added some garlic powder and lemon zest. 4 gravy packets made a ton of gravy, so I might cut back to 2 or 3 packets or use the canned gravy, as some suggested. If you decide to use less gravy, remember to cut back on the lemon pepper because the original recipe is VERY lemony as it is.

I finally am coming to rate this...which I should have done LONG ago.  I make a couple changes. I delete the green pepper, add a whole onion with the chicken while it's browning, and use jar gravy ( 2 jars ) as I like that specific type of chicken gravy the best.  It's VERY good and an easy, quick meal that everyone seems to like.

This is a keeper in my family. Very easy and quick to make. I also added a yellow pepper and the juice of 1 lime. It was super delicious. My 2 girls ages 11 and 9 couldn't get enough. My 1 year old loved the chicken and rice and Hubby and I thought it was great . It just shows you that this meal is good for all.

This was pretty nice, and a little unusual in my cooking experience. I'd never used packaged chicken gravy mix, I don't think. But I made this exactly as written, and served it over cooked brown rice. 3 packets of gravy might have been enough, but that's a minor quibble. Overall, it was a nice comfort-food kind of dish.

Very good!! I made some small changes based on my family's tastes: I sauteed one clove minced garlic in the vegetable oil before adding the chicken, I sprinkled some onion powder and Montreal chicken seasoning in the chicken as it was cooking.  I only had one red pepper, no green pepper, so I used a little bit of frozen stir-fry vegetables in the green pepper's place. I also only had 2 packets of chicken  gravy, but it turned out fine! 4 packets would've added a bit more sauce for the rice and that would've been great, but it was still fine as-is.  Very good, easy recipe!!!

I made this for my boyfriend who loves lemon pepper and anything with gravy and rice...  He literally asks for it every day and he takes the leftovers with him to work.  He says he could eat it everyday and not get tired of it lol...  Anywayz, I'm girlfriend of the century for making this one for him, he loves it!

4 stars - but I did change things up a bit. Added additional seasonings to the chicken, sauteed some onion in also - served over egg noodles. Easy and tasty. Thanks.

I really liked this recipe. I made it a little different because my boyfriend doesn't like gravy. I put the spices on the chicken and cooked the gravy separately for myself, adding more of the seasonings to that. It was great with and without the gravy! Will be making this again!

Very good, Wife loved it.  I did make my own lemon-pepper as always. Also used the canned gravy as recommended before

This was very easy to make.  My wife didn't think it she would like since it had chicken gravy in it, but she did.  I used 2 jars of chicken gravy sauce instead of the 4 packets as the jars were on sale.

Really nice. Only used 3 packets of gravy mix as 4 would have been way too many. Just served the 3 of us. Didn’t add salt and pepper at the end as I forgot. Tasted this before adding the gravy and it was lovely. Added a teaspoon of lemon juice as well. But with 3 packs of gravy mix, it took away the lemon pepper flavour, so next time would add more lemon pepper. I also added ½ a diced onion and shredded carrot for more vegie content. Thanks for a great recipe.

One of my family's favorites! I use 3 peppers, 1/2 onion, and only 2 packets of gravy. It's plenty of gravy, more vegetables and very filling! Love the taste!

The proportions of ingredients are not right for the number of servings.  You need at least one pepper per person, but two is better.  I only made 1 packet of gravy and the sauce was just right for those ingredients, but if the peppers increase, the 4 packets will probably work better.

We used garlic pepper instead of lemon pepper for this recipe (just because we're not big fans of lemon pepper), and let me say, this was so easy and so delicious! My ten year old and I finished the whole pan! I served it with white rice. Yummy!

There's really nothing wrong with this. I only rated it 3* because it was a little bland. It was very simple to make and I had all ingredients on hand. I will make it again but I will try to spice it up a bit.

This was very good.  The only thing I did different was to use to mixed peppers that come from the frozen section.  That made this easy recipe even easier.

this recipe is great for when you're on a crunch, or you simply don't like slaving away in the kitchen for hours. this has been on my regular rotation for a year now. only changes i made are saute'ing the chicken in 2 cloves of chopped garlic and using 2 cans of chicken gravy like other viewers have suggested.
