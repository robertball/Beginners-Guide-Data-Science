I only made one change in this recipe, I used "soured" lactose-free milk.  I cannot tell you how great it was to have the batter waiting for me when I got up this morning. I did let it sit out for a half hour (enough for me to have a cup of coffee before I started making the pancakes) before I ladled it on to the griddle. I made Supreme Strawberry Topping to go over these pancakes. My family thought this was delicious!

This recipe is not correct nor is it good. Regular pancakes are much better and have a far better flavor. If you want a very delicious 'yeasted' pancake, look up another recipe. A genuine yeasted pancake recipe will include butter and no baking soda or baking powder. Also, the serving sizes are HUGE in this recipe.

These pancakes are very interesting, as well as very tasty! The yeast adds a different flavor than traditional pancakes. I love the convenience of storing it in the fridge overnight; it is nice to have a bowl of batter waiting to speed up preparation the next morning. These are great served with strawberry syrup!

Lisa, these pancakes are phenomenal! 4 main things that I love about these pancakes; 1: They taste so good, mainly because of the buttermilk, and the fact that they sat all night and the flavors melded and marinated 2: the recipe made a huge batch  -  a batch that actually serves my family instead of the measly 15 pancakes in most recipes 3: they tasted better as the day went by! I made the whole batch and there were only a few left over the next morning- and they tasted better then when they were hot off the griddle! 4: they were incredibley easy to make. Just throw the ingredients together and shove it in the fridge!  I literally could not stop eating them. Thank you for the fantastic recipe!

Great recipe. The pancakes are slightly yeasty flavored but in a pleasant way. Very convenient to make! I added a little extra sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, but I do that to nearly every pancake recipe just because I like those flavors. Thank you!

Awesome!  I added 5 tsp sugar and vanilla to the batter.  Perfect for a Sunday morning family breakfast.  Especially when served with blueberry and raspberry toppings.   Made enough to have left overs for the kids before school during the week.

These were pretty good.  I made half the recipe and had plenty of batter.  10 pancakes (using 1/4 of batter)
The second day we added chocolate chips- those were really good!

These were okay.  They were a little blander than regular pancakes, so I think next time I'll increase the sugar.  They did come out  light and fluffy though and get that 4th star because it was nice to make the batter the night before and just  wake up in the morning, turn on the griddle, and start cooking.  I quartered the recipe since it was just my husband and I and it made 5 very large pancakes, so I imagine the whole batch would feed a crowd.

These are good, but my kids didn't really like them. I'm pretty sure they just are not used to this slightly diffent taste.  I thought they were ok.  They are better with some strawberry jam on them instead of regular pancake syrup. Give them a try, you may enjoy this different pancake!

These pancakes are delicious! I serve them with powdered sugar on top and it really pushes this recipe over the top. I usually make half a batch at that serves at least 4 people.

These were good. They had a slightly different flavor than regular pancakes. I loved that you could make this the night before and wake up to batter ready to go. I did use butter in place of the oil and I only had 3 eggs so I used 3/4 c of egg whites as well. Also I added extra sugar and vanilla. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the idea of an overnight "soaked" pancake, but we weren't crazy about these.  Neither the flavor nor texture were great - not bad, but not near as good as many other pancake recipes that we have tried.  I'm glad I tried it, but would not care to make it again.
