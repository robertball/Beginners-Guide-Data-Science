Fanstatic!! Just loved this recipe. I was soo worried about all the water in this recipe. But when the product was done...it really looked like a thick coarse refried beans with a hint of sweetness...not so much either. I had never eated lentils like this before and only tried a could of times in a soup. So as I got done with the 1st step in cooking the lentils in the water and broth, I was surprised at what flavor it held on it's own with out having pepper added. having said that...I really liked them before I got started with the 2nd step. I will totally make this again and again. My whole family loved them but my son...but that was to be expected. Looking  at this recipe the one thing I changed but it's because I didn't want a high sugar content to it, was change to a sugar free alternative to the honey. It was just delish! And to think lentils are soo high in protein amazed me. 1/4 cup of cooked lentils yields 10 grams of protein!! This makes me very happy. Do try this recipe. it was really really great.

DELICIOUS!!! My first time making a meal with lentils. The only ingredient I didn't have was ground ginger. I used a dash of ground cloves instead and it turned out so good. I served the lentils over brown rice with a side of fried cabbage. I will definitely be making this again.

These lentils are awesome.  Even my husband loved them and he is not a lentil fan. The only change I made was to decrease the salt from 2 teaspoons to a 1/4 teaspoon.  I try to cook low-sodium and after adding chicken broth and soy sauce, I figured I needed to reduce the salt.  They were still delicious and anyone who wants more salt could just add some to their portion. Thanks for a great recipe sassymom!

Not Bad! I added a cup of tomato sauce instead of water before I put it in the oven and it ended up tasting like baked beans.

These were great! I didn't use all of the honey, and I'm glad I didn't it would've been way too much. They had great flavor and made enough for a weeks worth of lunches!

I think the initial cooking time for the lentils is too long.  I followed the recipe and what I wound up with was more like lentil mush.  The flavor is alright, but kind of distracting.  It's odd tasting sweet lentils and the baby food like texture I got from this recipe wasn't that appealing.  I might try this again but cook the lentils for less time initially so that they hold their shape better.

These were pretty good. I'm not sure I'm crazy about sweet lentils but they were easy and good for someone who doesn't like lentils very much.

I really liked these.  I've been trying to encorporate more lentils in my diet and this was a great recipe for all.  I did cut the recipe down to 2 servings and thought it still served at least 6 so you may not want to trust the serving size.

These were distasterous for me.  I didnt see anything anywhere about soaking them ahead of time, so I didn't.  I followed the directions, even ended up boiling them for a little longer just because they still seemed really firm.  I baked them for an hour and they were still firm.  Another 1/2 hour and still firm  Had to add more liquid and baked for another hour if not more.  Guess what, they were still firm and the liquid was all gone so they were kind of dry too.    By this time (we had eaten almost 2 hours before) so I finally gave up because they still weren't ready to eat.

This recipe is really delicious. I replaced the chicken stock with a low sodium vegetable broth, to make it vegetarian, and it was perfect. Despite some of the other reviews that said there was too much liquid, I found that the amounts specified in the recipe were just right. I used green lentils, of course, but I'd bet some of the others used red lentils, which caused problems in terms of the liquid. My only other comment is that this is sweet! Next time I'll use a bit less honey. My 3 year old and 5 year old gobbled this up on rice. I will definitely make this again!

Probably the lentils I like best so far . . .I will say I have tried several and haven't liked them; I think they are really bland.  These, though, are better bc there is flavor in them.  I'd probably add more ginger and ground mustard, but otherwise it was good. The honey works well in this, although I was somewhat concerned.   A caution if you halve this:  you may need to add more liquid than what is called for, as mine started to burn at the time indicated on the stove.  Next time, I'd just add more water and keep a closer eye on them.  I was able to rescue them before they all did, but it seems lentils need lots of water!  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh. my. goodness.  This has literally become one of my favorite, FAVORITE dishes to make!  I just made it for the second time.  It is so delicious!

I followed the recipe to the absolute (something that is hard for me, hah), and it was perfect.  I served it over plain white rice with a vegetable on the side (asparagus, a salad, etc.).  I will make this again and again!

Correction:  I looked back at the recipe and realized I did make two small changes.  I didn't have whole bay leaves so I just sprinkled some of my crushed bay leaves in (which I could not remove after boiling, of course, so just left them in).  Also, I didn't have dry mustard so I just used a tsp of regular yellow mustard.  Worked for me!

Always my problem with lentils - the recipe NEVER states which type of lentils to use. Anyone remotely familiar with lentils knows that there are several varieties. I grew up in Asia, so I am most familiar with yellow and orange lentils. I used a combination of those two (10 oz yellow, 6 oz orange). I ended up with watery, watery MUSH. I suspected this might be a problem after the initial cook time they still had tons of liquid and already were starting to look mushy, but I gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt and added the extra cup of water anyways. I ended up with soup. However, the flavor was fantastic, and I intend to serve leftovers over brown rice tomorrow. Word to the wise: think BIGGER varieties of lentils (i.e. Split pea type) as these would need a lot more liquid to cook down. All in all, I will make this again, as it is somehow deliciously reminiscent of my childhood in Asia, although I am certain we never added honey to our lentils! One last note - my pot was more like a soup pot, so not much surface area for water to evaporate. Next time I might pour these into a 9x13 for the bake time.

Followed the recipe EXACTLY & it is a "melt in your mouth" awesome experience!!   I wouldn't change a thing, but I do enjoy SWEET a lot.  Some may want to cut down or use a substitute sweetener if they are sweet sensitive.  For the person who had so much trouble getting the lentils to cook, I doubt that there is a problem with the recipe  .. more likely the lentils or your stove/oven.

Nothing is wrong with the recipe, it is just my taste buds. I guess sweet lentils was a little too different for me to get used to. I made this recipe hoping for the taste of baked beans like some of the reviews I read said, but I just tasted lentils... and I tasted sweet. Lentils. Sweet. A lot of each, both separately, but I couldn't find that complimentary mixture of savory and sweet with lentils and honey. I used green lentils and cooked them exact as in recipe and they were cooked perfectly.

Based on other reviews I halved the amount of salt and honey, and that was the right decision for me, as it was still plenty sweet (next time I'll use even less honey), and just salty enough.

I did pre-soak the lentils in a bit of water (for easier digestion), and that may be why the amount of water per the recipe was too much. I ended up with a very tasty lentil soup.

This was delicious, but there were a few adjustments I would definitely recommend. First, reduce the salt. I cut it down to one teaspoon, since two seemed like a lot, and it was still a bit too salty when it finished. Next time I'll probably keep it at 1/2 teaspoon. Also, I cut the amount of honey in half, since a few people mentioned doing so and again, the amount called for seemed like a lot. I'm glad I did, it came out delicious. Other than that, it's great! All the water in it had me scared but it all worked out perfectly - this is definitely earning a spot in the repertoire.

This recipe is pretty easy to make and it's quick. My daughter told me about this recipe last summer and I'm finally getting around to making some as it's one of those do nothing dreary winter days. It just came out of the oven and my husband tasted it and promptly got himself a bowl. He said "This is really good!" I like the mild sweet taste and love that it is fat free.

Very good indeed but, please, how does Sassymom's daughter square her vegetarianism with the chicken broth?

Excellent! This was really really good. The amount of liquid does seem like a lot but it gets absorbed. I used less salt and put in carmelized onions instead of the chopped onion it called for and that worked out well. Another reviewer said it was kind of like baked beans...yes, it does resemble that but not quite so sweet. I'll definitely make this again.

WOW!!! This is not a traditional lentil dish! I could make this every week, they were so delicious and not unhealthy either. Even friends that hated lentils really liked this dish! I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I liked the flavor... need to cook it for a little less time so it's not so mushy!
