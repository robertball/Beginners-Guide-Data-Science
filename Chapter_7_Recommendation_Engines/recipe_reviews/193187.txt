So delicious and very versatile!  I made this last night for dinner modifying it to fit what I had on hand.  I had tons of fresh basil, a half a pint of grape tomatoes, and 5 pounds of mozzarella on hand left over from a charity event we made baked ziti for.  Since I only had half the amount of tomatoes called for, I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce I found in the pantry, and loaded the sauce up with fresh basil instead of just adding it at the end.  I used two cups of mozzarella in place of the pepper jack and served this over ravioli instead of penne.  Usually I stick to a recipe the first time I make it but I wanted a quick dinner using ingredients I already had, so I changed this a little bit and it came out great.  Definitely try this recipe, and don't be afraid of doing a little experimentation.  I will be certainly be making this again.  Next time I'm going to try the recipe exactly as written, but I'm sure it's great either way!

I was a little hesitant to try this but it was absolutely delicious and I gave it 5 stars.  The only modification I made was that I used 3 tbl. regular olive oil and 1 tbl. dried basil.  Very creamy and with just a slight kick due to the pepperjack cheese.  It's like a new versions of mac and cheese.  You won't be diappointed if you give this recipe a shot.

This is a great pasta dish!  I added yellow squash and zucchini (because I do to everything this time of year!), and used plum tomatoes because I didn't have grape.  I can't believe I'm going to say it, but the amount of cheese was too much for me, made doing the dishes a bear too trying to get all the cheese off the plates and pans.  Next time I make this, which I definitely will, I will use less cheese and more basil.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the ingredients when I saw this recipe, but I didn't end up loving the recipe itself so much. Melting the cheese as directed makes the cheese clumpy when trying to mix the penne in. I had to break up chunks of cheese that melted to try to distribute it throughout the dish. Next time, I would advise to put the cheese into the hot penne instead of putting the penne into a pan of melted cheese. After tasting, it was lacking some flavor, so we decided to add some homemade pesto to the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I made the following changes:  Smart Taste Rotini instead of Penne, followed the directions on the box for cooking time.  I used much less cheese than the recipe called for - about 1/2 a cup of mozz, a small amount of parm and added feta instead of the jack.  It came out great.  Next time I will add spinach for sure.  I served it with the Parmesan Chicken recipe by Mollie Hall on this site (see my review there for my adjustments).  FANTASTIC dinner - everyone in the family had seconds!

This tasted like a dish from Macaroni Grill. Loved it! I added spinach, added about 2-3 times as much basil, cut back on the parm and increased the jack for an extra kick. Next time I'll add shrimp.

WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE!!! Seriously. I used the amt called for and it was overwhelming. I'd halve it. I also used only mozz and parm and it was delicious. The flavor is good though my boyfriend complained it was too tart with the tomatoes. He said maybe we could try broccoli next time... we'll see.  Also, I added some chicken broth to simmer the tomatoes... because how do you simmer anything in 2T oil? I think the chicken broth is a good addition. I added maybe 1/3 of a small can.

So good. I had fresh chicken that I added as well and it made the dish a little more filling. For leftovers a second night I mixed in cooked broccoli which was terrific too. Easy to adapt and so yummy!!!

This recipe did NOT turn out the way I thought it would.  It was bland and the cheese was very lumpy making it hard to serve.  My suggestion is to add some garlic salt and put in the cheese right after you put in the penne pasta.

i asked my mom "on a scale of 1-5 what would rate it?" and without hesitation she said "10!" and my parents are brutally honest with me when it comes to food because they know i want to open my own restaurant in a couple years. i changed it a little bit. i just put in the olive oil and got the pan warm and put in the garlic some basil and tomatoes all at one time. i put half the amount of garlic because my dad doesnt like garlic. i thought it was enough to have some flavor but blend in really well so you couldnt notice it. i did the 1 cup of mozzarella but instead of 1 cup of pepperjack i did half a cup of feta and i didnt add the parmesan because my dad doesnt like that either and the feta has a parmesan flavor to it so i think it would be overpowering a little. it was still really good and my mom said it was perfect and i shouldnt change anything and i totally agree.

This was very good, very flavorful and super simple to make.... will be making this on sports nights when time for making supper is limited. I didn't have pepperjack cheese so I used a prepared mix of strong shredded cheeses and added just a teaspoon of red pepper... As for the portion - not gonna feed 4 adults with this recipe, it would have to be doubled... very good. I may add prosciutto next time I make it, or italian sausage, altough it was good as is, I think prosciutto would make it ahhh hmmmm perfect!

Made it again and added Prosciutto - ahhh, was soooo perfect!

Really good, and super easy. I added a can of diced tomatoes and served with grilled chicken on top. I also didn't have basil oil so just sprinkled basil in the olive oil.

loved it! Didn't have all the cheeses so used one slice of veggie pepperjack, 1/2 cup of mexican mix kroger brand shredded cheese, and about 1/2 cup of parmesan.  Also used fresh basil leaves and a couple of shakes of dried basil (maybe about 1 tsp).

Sucha great recipe.  I was crunched for time, and ingredients.  I put actual basil spice in with the olive oil & used baby shell pasta.  Also, just used cheddar cheese.  Put some cheddar cheese on top when it was all combined in casserole dish & baked in oven for 10min. Company absolutely loved it!

Terrific! We loved this! The cheeses were so good together. I would have never guessed pepperjack could have been so smooth and delicious when paired with mozzerella! I did add black olives since they were in the frige and thw whole thing was wonderful!

This is our new family favorite and I make a modified version several times a month.  Like others, I reduced the amount of cheese in half and reserve some to sprinkle over the top of each serving, since much of the cheese clumps or sticks to the bottom of the pan.  I also add some basil to the olive oil at the beginning since I don't have basil oil.  I saute yellow summer squash with the tomoates and add extra basil while the veggies simmer.  A great dish - quick, easy and flavorful.

I tried this recipe and it came out really good. I'm not the best of all cooks and my boyfriend devoured it. I made it as is, and I thought it was a little bit cheesy. I think however, that I'll add more tomatoes next time and see how that works out. :) Yum-o!

I loved this Recipe! However, I did make a few modifications. First, I used  Monterey-jack cheese instead of mozzarella (only because it what i had on hand). Since My mom, sister, and i dont eat wheat, i made this with penne pasta as well as gluten free. I was very surprised it actually tasted good gluten free. Finally i added both fresh and dried basil for more flavor. Overall, I thought this recipe was easy, fresh, and delicious and i will definitely make it again :)

This was a great idea. I eliminated the pepper jack and mozzarella (cause i didn't have any) and used whole wheat spiral. It was perfect. My 4 year old asked for more.

This was definitely a cheesy dish, which I can't complain about because I love anything cheesy.  I did double the pasta but only added a little more than the amount of cheese and it was still had plenty of cheese.  Overall, it has a very nice blend of flavors with a little kick from the pepperjack.  Thanks from the great recipe!

it was way too cheesy, the pepperjack was too overpowering and at the same time bland. maybe if you cut both the mozzarella and pepperjack in half then add about 1/3c of chicken broth and salt and pepper to taste, it would be more enjoyable. i added some chicken broth to mine which seemed to have saved the dish.

Its a keeper! Really easy to make, I usually keep most of these ingredients in my house already so this side dish had been added to our regular rotation. The only thing I did different was used wheat penne instead of regular penne. Goes great with breaded chicken cutlets (or adding leftover chicken cutlets cut into small pieces)

Mine did not quite turn out the way it looks in the photo. Lot less red and less green. We still liked it, but felt it needed more of something...not sure what? 2 pints of grape tomatoes? Maybe trying the chicken broth I saw suggested too? I will try it again though.

Delicious pasta, and we experiment with pasta frequently.  Everyone cooks in this family. Used feta cheese instead of pepperjack.  I made a big woops. I made to much pasta for the amount of cheese.  Next time I will either make less pasta or double the cheese. Definitely a five star.

Yum!  I "downgraded" to regular tomatoes (local, flavorful and NOT Roma) to save a little money, but it still tasted great.  Also, I used wheat pasta.  Do not be afraid to add more basil!  I think I ended up adding 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup and it added a great flavor.

This was really good.  I added some crushed red pepper for a little extra kick. I can't wait to have it again tommorow for lunch.

Great recipe!  I had a ton of grape tomatoes from our yard to use and some fresh basil too so this was a great way to use them.  I have two small children, so I sauted some diced up chicken in olive oil with a little garlic & s/p first and then removed the chicken added a little more oil and followed the recipe minus the basil oil.  I used whole wheat rigatoni and it was DELICIOUS!  Great recipe! Thanks!

If I try this again I would leave out the mozzarella. All the cheese clumped together....not a creamy dish as described.  But I think it would have been delicious, otherwise. Maybe use cream cheese instead of mozzarella.

Meh.  Pretty bland, and the cheese got grainy and odd when mixed with the tomatoes.  Wasn't bad by any means, but I also won't be making it again.

This was very good and my family enjoyed it.  I thought it was a little too cheesy, pan and plates were hard to clean afterward.  Maybe I'll try adding more tomatoes and basil next time so it's not so sticky.  I will definitely make it again!

The first time it was extremely bland with way too much cheese. The second time around, I added more garlic, put the penne in the pan with the tomatoes before adding half amount of cheese. This helped blend it together easier then added pesto along with italian seasoning, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper and added a spoonful of sour cream. This gave it a creamy texture which was tasty. My rating is for the original recipe as is but I would recommend playing around with it.

Very good!  I did have to substitute the jack cheese.  I'm feeding tots & I didn't have any. I used feta!  It was great!  The only other thing I did different was sauté some diced red onion with the garlic.  And because I didn't have basil oil I used extra olive oil & added fresh basil & 1/2 tsp of prepared pesto.

Eating this for dinner right now and I'm really enjoying it! Used about 1 1/4 cup of cheese (1 cup mozarella, 1/4 cup parm) and added dried basil and red pepper flakes to the oil before cooking garlic. I used nearly a full box of pasta and it had a great cheese to pasta ratio, for us. Also added 1/3 cup of chicken broth. Very simple, delicious recipe.

Expected it to be more saucy, was VERY cheesy. Too much cheese. But at the same time, the tomato is framed well by it, so YMMV. I used fresh basil and it could have used more, but that’s on me. Will make it again though!

I've made this twice. While it is good, it's just a macaroni and cheese recipe with a little tomato in it. I believe it would be better for a side dish to your meal. 

Mozzarella gives it a nice creamy texture and the pepper jack give it a slight bite. While it is good, and it is meatless, it's not really a recipe I would consider make a lot.

This came out very good ! At first I was worried that the melting cheese would not blend properly with the pasta but as I could mutinied to stir it it meshed perfectly ...I used tri color penne which added a pop of color and cooked the basil into the sauce because I didn't have the basil oil...the pepper jack cheese blended very well w the mozzarella ...would Def use again

I made this dish exactly as the recipe directed.  Everything was fine up to the point of adding the 3 cheeses to the pan.  It completely balled up and would not incorporate with the pasta.  The only way to save the dish was to quickly make 1 cup of cream sauce to loosen the ball of cheese.  The taste was nice but I would not make it again because of the added calories & fat with the sauce and 3 cheeses.

My family and I loved this recipe! I agree with the other reviews that it does need some tweaking. In regards to the ratio of cheese to pasta, that is definitely going to come down to personal preference. If you typically like a lot of sauce with your pasta then don't change the listed amounts. If you prefer to have your pasta lightly coated with sauce to enhance the flavor then use either double the amount of pasta or half the amount of cheese.  Here is how I made this one:
First I cooked some chicken in the pan seasoned with the oil, salt, pepper and chili powder. Once that was done I cooked the garlic then poured in 1/3 C chicken broth and followed the recipe from there.  
I read that people were having issues with combining the pasta and cheese and I did too, at first. I decided to pour the cheese into the pasta as suggested then let the whole thing sit on low heat until I heard it sizzle. Once it was heated I started to stir everything together. That made it so much easier to get the pasta well coated. Hope that helps  :-)

My family really enjoyed this dish. I would just recommend doing the cheese differently as another reviewer said it melted in clumps and was challenging to distribute evenly. There were no leftovers which says it all.

Just made this, and it's really good. the cheese gets all melty and stringy and hard to keep under control while eating.  Beware. Also, I added a chopped habenero for some extra heat and it was fuego.

I could have eaten a whole pot of this all by myself...  but I didn't!  I used Monterey Jack cheese and a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes instead of the Pepper Jack to tone down the spice for my kids.  Next time, I'll try adding spinach.  This was a wonderful way to use up some extra grape tomatoes I had leftover from a catering event.

Loved it, but I made a few changes. I add ground beef, crushed red pepper for more flavor, and instead of grape tomatoes I used two cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with peppers. The whole family loved it.

This recipe was amazing, quick, and easy. I was able to cut recipe in half to make it for two people. 
I added a bit of oregano, used wheat penne pasta, cut the basil oil, and only used parmesan cheese because that is all I had on hand. It still turned out great, I can only imagine how delicious it would be if I had all the proper ingredients.

Followed directions as stated and loved it. fast and easy. Some say to much noodles, but you need to make sure you look at the size of the package you use. Most are 12 to 16oz packages, so only use half the package and it is great. Will diffidently do this again.

It's just missing a little salt and pepper.  This would be a complete meal if it has some kind of meat in it.  It makes a wonderful side dish alongside some eggplant and chicken Parmesan or Pane'd pork chops (breaded and deep fried).  I absolutely LOVE this combination of flavors!!!

I not only loved it, but 44 of 44 guests loved it as well. It was easy  to prepare in advance and every last bit of pasta was eaten. I added red pepper flakes to the sauce, because I like a little kick to my food. 
My only regret was that I didn't make more. I could have made another 16 portions and it would have disappeared as well. Sadly, no leftovers for me.

The taste was good.  I should have mashed up the tomatoes.  Also, the cheese was hard to spread after it melted.  I would make it again though.

Quick, easy and tasty!  I followed the directions exactly, including the tip to use 2 T olive oil instead of basil oil.  The only issue was that the cheese lumped into a large blob instead of spreading evenly throughout.  With a bit of manipulation, everyone received cheese and declared this dish a success.

I liked the ingredients from the beginning but ended up not really loving the recipe nor the process either. The way it is written, the cheese ends up clumpy which is not that great. I also made it for 2 people and honestly the proportions seemed off. I had fresh basil and flat leaf parsley. The latter I used it for decoration. Still, ended up with a bland kind of pasta with clumpy bits of cheese. I will definitely add flavor with a bit of chopped sun dried tomatoes, add more basil, especially to the tomatoes while cooking instead of at the end. I would mix the penne with the blistered tomatoes and add the mozarella in two batches: a bit on the pan and the rest divided on each serving and let it melt with the residual heat. Honestly, the recipe is not bad is just the procedure and proportions that seem a bit off. Feel free to add more basil and tomatoes if you feel or see it might not be enough. I will use more tomatoes next time definitely. The idea of adding a bit of tomato sauce is actually not bad...it might also make up for the extra tomatoes it might still need. I only had mozzarella and parmesan so I replaced the jack cheese for mozzarella. Another way to get the kick without the jack cheese would be to sprinkle dried chili flakes to the tomatoes while they simmer. The recipe makes good for a meatless pasta day!

I made it, it was very delicious! Next time I will double the tomatoes and The basil as well as cut back on the cheese. It’s a great recipe, I just love the taste the tomatoes get by cooking in the oil as well as the basil added for taste. Great job to the originator of the recipe.

This is just plain delicious.  I should have let the cheese melt more.  Place the basil on top and let it sit for a minute to gain the right texture.

Used 2 pints tomatoes, puréed  some in my nutribullet, added 1 link sweet Italian sausage and cooked in my instapot on high pressure 5 mins. Then I  added my cooked penne pasta and cheeses. Also added more basil and more Parmesan. Served with homemade crusty artisan bread. My version was much better!

This was pretty good although I will make a couple of changes next time. For starters, there was just way too much garlic for my taste. I'll cut it down from 3 to 1 clove next time. Also, as others have commented, there is a little too much cheese. I'll cut it back next time and/or add some milk or cream to make it creamer. Otherwise, it was pretty good.

It takes a bit of tweaking to get the cheese sauce smooth.  I had to add milk to loosen things up.  Overall, the the flavors were good, but the recipe as printed requires adjustments.  Added some tomato basil chicken sausage, just because.

You need at least 2 types of cheese for this dish to taste good (I used parmesan and mozzarella). I also added a bit of water (eyeballed it) and some black pepper for seasoning. The water makes the cheese look like the ones on pizza, very strong-y. The black pepper gives it a little kick. I mostly just eyeballed the ingredients and added more if I saw that it was needed. It’s a very good dish. I brought it to school today and all my classmates absolutely loved it. (If you’re refrigerating and reheating the next day, make sure you had a bit of water for hydration for the pasta and to be sure the cheese is remelted.)

Hubby and I loved this! I did make some adjustments. I used about a Tbsp of olive oil, total.  I sliced up some turkey kielbasa and fried that out first, drained, set aside. Then along with the garlic I added some chopped red onion and proceeded with the rest of the recipe. I did follow another's suggestion and tossed the pasta in with the tomato mixture, THEN added the cheese and mixed it all up . I didn't have pepper jack, just used some white queso shredded cheese that I had on hand, in addition to the mozzarella.  
Before serving, I found it necessary to pop the individual bowls into the microwave for 30 seconds on high to get everything sufficiently hot. 
Served with a slice of crusty garlic bread and a glass of red wine. Total yum!

I used extra olive oil instead of basil oil and Colby cheese instead of pepperjack! My husband was practically licking the plate! Also, I only cooked my penne rigate for 6 minutes.

Well I’m glad I cheated and read all the previous reviews otherwise I would have been really disappointed.  I added zucchini and used mozzarella, cheddar and fresh Parmesan for the cheese at less amount then in the recipe.
Still the cheese went chunky and yes was hard to clean thank goodness for SOS pads??.
I’ll make it again and play with the cheese as I did enjoy it.

I added mushrooms, broccoli and asparagus, which helped, but it was a bit heavy on the cheese and not enough flavor, other than cheese.

I found it very hard to mix in the cheese. It was quite sticky and clumpy. If I had read the reviews first, I would have added more vegetables and made it more of a one dish meal.

Well, l liked it but l did some changes because the fact that it is a mix of 3 different cheeses, makes the mix so thick and not manageable with a spoon. So, l added whole milk plus evaporated milk until l got a more liquid consistency (like sauce). It was a hit with both my little son and husband.
l also used garlic powder and some pepper additional to its original ingredients.
l would do it again with the changes l made.

I used oregano instead of basil because I didn’t have any basil. I also didn’t use quite as much cheese as was called for. The penne with tomatoes and garlic with cheese was very delicious. The Parmesan cheese helped give it an edge.

Great Tasting Dish! Never thought my husband would go for it because its meatless, but he actually loved how flavorful it was. I think it was the pepperjack cheese that did the trick of so much flavor. Definitely yummy. I didn’t have basil oil so I used all olive oil but because I’d spent the money on the fresh basil and had so much of it I actually minced up a heaping tablespoonful and cooked it along with the garlic . At the end I still garnished with additionl fresh basil, as is called for in the recipe, and hoped it wasn’t too much. Nope, the taste was awesome !  Wonderful,  wonderful.

We did this with shells rather than penne since we had a box of them on hand, and cut the oil by half while adding a half pound of ground Italian sausage.  (We had some leftover sausage that needed using.) Made a fantastic entree, and was done from taking out and ngredients to utting the dishes away in under an hour. 
Will definitely do this again, with or without the sausage.

Hi, I always read the comments before I make one of these dishes. I added some extra garlic and extra basil to enhance the flavor. This dish came out absolutely delicious. Oh, I also reduced  the amount of cheese.

We recommend turning down the heat (from medium to low) when cooking the garlic cloves and grape tomatoes. When on medium, it cooked too fast and burned the bottom of the pan.

A bit dry for my taste.  Suggested cooking the garlic a little too long. ( I knew better but followed the directions anyway. :P)  Maybe a little stock or wine added to the tomatoes while cooking to add flavor and moisture. Added cheese right before serving to improve the texture.  Great recipe to build on but as is, not a keeper.

Absolutely delicious. It's super easy and quick to make and pleases everyone in my family. None of my family really likes pepper jack cheese so we leave that out and it's still delicious.

Have made this a few times and love the recipe, but like the others, I'm not a fan of the clumpy cheese that results as you follow the recipe.  Decided to try something different so I sauteed the garlic in with a Tbl of butter and some olive oil...added a couple tablespoons of flour to make a roux, and then a bit of milk and some broth.  I then added all the cheese to this and got a very nice creamy sauce to add to the pasta and tomatoes and basil with no clumps!

My boyfriend & I loved this.  Fresh basil is a must!  I would but cubed fresh mozz on after the pasta is mixed with the garlic/ tomato mixture.  It melted together in the pot and was one glob.

I used 2T. Of olive oil, as I couldn't get basil oil and I used about 3/4 the amounts of mozzarella and pepper jack cheeses and it still turned out wonderfully.  My husband, who is not a big pasta fan, loves this recipe!

I will most definitely make this again!!! It was easy to make and had great flavor! Not to mention that it looked "pretty" as well!!  It had the look and taste of something you would order at a nice restaurant.

Was Fantastic but i would add a little more liquid but that was my own fault. I did add chicken which gave it some protein and some meat but a very good recipe and definitely would make it again!

I loved the ingredients, but didn't turn out as I had hoped. I love lots of sauce so this dish wasn't for me. Maybe I will try it again with a marinara or a white sauce :)

This was very good ! I cooked a bit too much pasta because I had a 16 oz box. It appeared it may be too dry and I added a half a jar of tomato basil pasta sauce. I also baked it at 350 in a deep casserole dish for 20 minutes.

This was so delicious and the hubby loved it as well!  We ate it as a side dish to chicken.  But this would also be great to add in sliced chicken to make it as a main meal.  The recipe name does make it sound like this would be a "lighter" dish.  But like many other reviewers have stated, this is a heavier and very cheesy dish.  I added a healthy splash of milk/cream at the end of cooking to thin it out into a sauce.  I also added in some diced onion to sautee in with it.  The only change I would make next time would be to double the tomato and double the fresh basil.  Also save that pasta water!  You can add in a splash at the end to pull it together  when adding in the pasta.  I cannot tell you how good it smelled in the kitchen when the basil oil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes were simmering together!  YUM!  It inspired me to make a rendition of this recipe by lightening it up with less cheese  and to simmer some white wine with the basil, tomato, garlic mixture.  Thanks for this great recipe!  It for sure is a keeper and will be made again and again!

When it came time for the oil I put in two tablespoons fresh Basil (minced).Then I added 4 total tablespoons of oil total. As for the cheese I waited to to add it last after I combined the base with noodles, I used a cup of jalopeno cheese and a cup of mozzarella  cheese. After all them changes I enjoyed the meal.

I loved it. I made mine like this-
Brought water to boil and added penne. Started sauce when put pasta in water.
Sautéed garlic in olive oil with some basil flakes for about 2 minutes,  added the tomatoes, pinch salt and pepper to taste for about 3-4 minutes, then added a little vegetable stock and cooked additional 3-4minutes. 
Drained pasta, poured sauce over pasta , added cheese and did not have fresh basil in store so bought basil paste and put about 1 1-2 T in  and stirred.  It  was stringy but we thought delicious with a little heat from pepper jack to give the dish a little pop.
I think you could add anything to this dish- spinach, veggies, meat or seafood and all variations could be delicious. Thanks for a great recipe and hope you try it as it is quick and delicious recipe. 

Oh and  Earlier in day cut cheeses and put in fridge and washed and sliced tomatoes, even put pot of water on stove with lid on it so when time to cook I just cooked- no having to take time to do all that so made for really quick and easy last minute meal

Fun and fairly east dish to make and eat. I added some spicey tomato sauce as well as cube chicken/turkey to make the meal heartier. I added another scoop of mozzarella to the top of a bowl of leftovers.

I put in the cheese (@1-1/4  cups of  Mozzarella & 1/2 cup of Parmesan) AFTER I had put in the penne pasta. Added 3 large garlic cloves, 1/2 medium onion diced, 1/3 green bell pepper diced & @ 2Tbsp of"fresh basil,  from the tube, @1 tsp dry oregano."  Used Roma tomatoes, @2 pounds, (I prefer them) seeded & diced. I did sprinkle freshly TORN basil on top, remember, that using a knife will turn the leaves dark along the cuts, so take the time and tear it:)

Seems like a lot of cheese for only 8 oz of pasta. As someone else said, cheese becomes lumpy if not melted in (or over) something.

I followed the recipe as outlined here but I also found the cheese lumpy.  I added a bit of milk before adding the pasta which helped, but once the pasta went in it lumped up again.  We were all looking forward to the meal but unfortunately my kids wouldn't eat it .  The flavour was nice though.

We prefer more sauce/less chunks. I followed the recipe and my teenager/pasta fanatic kiddo said it was alright, which means not great and not bad. We will try it again with modifications by reducing the amount of halved tomatoes and adding tomato sauce to fit our preferences. However, we were happy to try a new pasta recipe! Thanks!

Made this for dinner tonight. I thought it was ok, but my hubby loved it.I added spinach and shrimp, if I make it again I will add more garlic. All in all it was a good meal.

Good base recipe, but I used 3/4 cup of each cheese and added 4 ounces of cream cheese - very creamy and super delicious! I also often add spinach and/or mushrooms. Love this recipe using my tweaks!!
