Excellent recipe!!  It was very easy and tastes wonderful!  I added more Nilla wafers to get a thicker crust, but made no other substitutions!

These were really yummy and easy, as advertised.  I did add more wafers to the crust as seemed to be the trend.  I made everything the night before to save time and then added the strawberries just before serving.  I think it would have been harder to slice if I hadn't refrigerated as long as I did.

Took this for a picnic today and it was great. I think I would increase the crust part for next time as it was a very thin layer. We also spooned the strawberries over the top and added more cool whip.

I made these for our Christmas party and it was a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe!!! I did also add more wafers to the crust.  I used frozen strawberries due to availability, still good!

I agree, the crust could have been thicker, next time I make this I will likely double the crust portion. I ended up having to put mine in the freezer for a little while because a couple of hours in the fridge wasn't good enough. Turned out really tasty though! I used vanilla pudding for pie filling for my dessert.
