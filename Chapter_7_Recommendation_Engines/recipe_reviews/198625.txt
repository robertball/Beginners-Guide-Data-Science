This was so awesome.  I fed six people off this and they all loved it.  According to my husband the bite is like fresh horseradish. It has a bite however it goes away quickly.

This was quick, easy and fantastic! I didn't have all the vegetables so I just used fresh corn of the cob, and I used corn starch instead of all-pourpose flour, but otherwise I followed the directions and it was wonderful. The whole family enjoyed it, even my picky 7 year old!

this was pretty good, but I accidentally let it boil down a little too much... it turned into a sauce and so I made spagetti and ate it over spagetti. my husband liked it a lot more than I did.

excellent recipe.  I modified to use what I had- fresh veggies/mushrooms and needed to increase milk/flour because of all I had.  thanks!

I've made this twice now and I can't give this enough praise. It is one of the best soups I've ever had and it's so easy to make! I normally add a bit more milk (I use about 3 - 4 cups of milk) than what is requested just because I like more broth in my soups. It always comes out delicious!

We made this for New Year's Eve dinner.  Easy to make with using frozen vegetables to save a lot of prep time. 

We also added some half-and-half in addition to the milk.  When we added in all the vegetables at the end, there didn't seem to be enough liquid and the half-and-half added some depth.

Awesome soup, so happy to have another chowder recipe to add to my collection. I have a great clam chowder recipe but, I actually like scallops better than clams. Love the little bite the soup has, I did use the smaller bay scallops, they were very tender and sweet,

I split the milk between low fat milk and coconut milk also I used small scallops so I didn't have to cut them in half.  This was our New Year comfort food.  A warm crusty bread went really good with it.

This was really delicious. Everyone loved it. I cooked it exactly as stated except I used fresh broccoli, red peppers and corn. It was awesome!
