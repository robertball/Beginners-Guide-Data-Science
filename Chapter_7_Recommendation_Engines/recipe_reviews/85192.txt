This is fantastic.  I had fresh peaches so I sweetened it with honey and added about 1/3 C. of cilantro along with the other ingredients.

I just made this on the fly (at 9:15pm) because I had all the ingredients on hand (except the seasoning, used a combo of garlic powder and other stuff) and I was hungry. SO delcious, I am making this again tomorrow to bring to a pre-haloween party. Thanks for the recipe, its a real winner.

This was SO good! I made it with fresh peaches that were super sweet and juicy. The only garlic chile paste I had was garlic sriracha, but it worked perfectly. I've served it over plain grilled chicken breasts and also grilled ahi tuna steaks. Delicious! Thanks so much!

With peaches in season I used fresh ones and I was excited to use my 5-spice powder b/c I don't have many recipes using this. I was disappointed with this recipe though, it didn't taste bad (reason I still gave 3 stars), just felt like it was missing something. Tried serving will grilled pork tenderloin and also w/tortilla chips. Tried adding a touch of sugar, ended up adding pre-made salsa to give it more flavor. It still tasted like it needed something else, neither me or my husband could figure out what though.

I made this salsa to go with teriyaki grilled fish.  I used some gorgeous fresh peaches from the farmers market.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be as good as I anticipated.  Nice heat from the garlic chile paste but I think flavor overpowered the perfume of the peaches.  The five spice got lost in the mix.  Also, the salsa was missing the pep that usually comes from onions -- the green onions just aren't peppy enough.

Lovely recipe Antilope. No one in my family likes cilantro, so we skipped it. Although we love spice, I cut the chile paste to a half a teaspoon and it was just perfect. Added some cucs to this too. Thanks!

Very easy and tasty.  Took to a summer party and everyone loved it.  I'd like it served over grilled chicken, port or fish.  Yum!

Words do NOT describe how GREAT this is!! I added some red bell pepper, just for color. I wish I had discovered it sooner:) There was only Sriracha in the house, so of course this beloved sauce got to swim with the peaches too! Very unusual & Delightfully unexpected! Thank You Antilope, You ROCK!!
