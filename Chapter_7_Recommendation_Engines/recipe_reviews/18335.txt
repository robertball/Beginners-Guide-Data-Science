Not a vidalia onion season has gone by without being asked to make it several times.  I am always asked for the recipe.  I only use 4 Tablespoons of butter in the crust (saltines do not work, you must use Ritz type crackers).  I use whole milk instead of half and half, but nonfat or lowfat milks don't cut it. Topped with about a cup of cheese, this pie is an awesome side for grilled meats.

We all love this recipe.  I have made it for the last 7 Christmases, once I got the recipe out of my mother-in-law : )  Hers was very specific stating 52 ritz crackers and if Vidalia Onions aren't in season, add sugar to the onions while sauteing them.  I am a big fan of sweetening the onions, so do it even when the Vidalia onions are in season.  I also make it 1-2 days ahead and just reheat the day of, to free oven space (the microwave even works...gasp!). Enjoy!

This makes a delicious & easy side dish and substitutions work well.  I used a variety of left over crackers and a mix of swiss and asiago cheeses.  I also added thyme but any of your favorite herbs would work well.

Very good recipe. In the future, I think I'll use crescent rolls as the crust.

So yummy - definitely a "treat" recipe though!  I cut down on the fat and added to the cheesiness a little by using a pottle of low-fat cottage cheese instead of half n half;  I whizzed it in the blender with the eggs and cheese to make a smooth custard.  Excellent as a wedge served with crispy crunchy salad for a vegetarian meal, or with crisp bacon and salad for meat eaters.

Like reviewer, Wilemon, I added 1/2c cheese to egg mixture, and 1/2c to top of pie.  And as Cookin'mama recommended, next time I would reduce the butter in the crust as it was a bit greasy.  All in all, it was good.  Very rich though; richer than what we are used to eating.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Susan!

Wow was this great!  Not 'oniony' at all, although my 7 year old was still turned off by seeing them there.  I followed the recipe the first time.  The second time I added mushrooms and a small tomato.  It passes my versatility test.

Easy and very tasty. I would have liked the crust to be a little crispier. Maybe I'll try baking it for 10 minutes first the next time I make this. A great complement to burgers.

This was very good but I knew 1/4 cup of cheese would not be enough for our taste so I added 1/2 cup to the egg mixture and also used 1/2 cup on top.

I have made this quiche and variations of it dozens of times, all of them delicious.  You can throw in bacon, spinach, broccoli, anything you like and it always turns out perfectly.

My family loved this, I made it as the recipe called for except I used extra onions, so I added a little more of everything. I did add some fresh chives to the crust for some color, and they did add a little something to the flavor. I also did not have on hand Vidiala onions, so I put about a tsp. of sugar in while I was cooking my onions, as another reviewer had suggested. A great side anytime....

This was very good. I subbed swiss instead of cheddar. Its oily and gooey just like it should be...not a regular part of my diet, but delicious!

I made the onion filling and half-and-half/egg mixture as directed, but added a shot of Worcestershire Sauce and some paprika to the liquid and a lot of love to the preparation.  I did not put it in a cracker crust, instead I layered the onions, and about a cup of swiss cheese in a casserole pan (I made three layers).   Topped it with the crushed ritz crackers/ Turned out YUMMY and house smelled so good while it was cooking.

This was so simple to do, and tasted so good. My son-in-law went gaga over this and not a real big onion fan. i added cheese to mixture. I also used less butter on the crust was not greasy at all.  I have been requested to make a double batch for Thanksgiving.  A real hit.

This was yummy! The Vidalia's are in for the season here, thank goodness, and I love them. This recipe combines some of my favorite things with butter crackers, onions and cheese, mmm! I am going to be making this with some variations over the summer. Thanks!

Very yummy, a great recipe that you can adapt in so many ways.  My crust didn't get hard, so maybe next time I will bake it a little bit first before adding the pie filling.

A friend made this and I just had to have the recipe.  It did not disappoint when I made it.  I'm just sad that there were no left-overs.  The only change I made was related to the cheese.  I doubled the amount of cheese and mixed it in with the egg mixture.  It wasn't necessarily on purpose, I just didn't read carefully enough, lol.  It was fabulous if I haven't said that already.

Very awesome! This is basically a very onion-y quiche, so I treated it to some of the more traditional quiche spices while throwing it together: a teeny bit of nutmeg for depth, and a smidge of paprika. I made a few other changes as well: I made a little extra crust and baked this in a jelly roll dish; switched out swiss cheese for the cheddar and used a little bit more onion than called for. This was a mild, flavorful dish with some very complex flavors. Awesome and filling!

This was really good. I used Club crackers for the crust and a locally made Bacon Cheddar for the cheese. Perhaps I didn't let it set for long enough (I waited 10 minutes) because it was a bit soft and flimsy getting out of the pan but it still tasted delicious.

Great Onion Pie.  I didn't have half and half, so used buttermilk.  Also took advice from comments and doubled cheese. I layered half the cheese on the crackers and half on top of the pie.  Mary

This recipe is amazing.  I was a little worried that there weren't enough eggs and that it would be dry, but it turned out perfect.  Like other reviewers, I also added more cheese to the top.  This was a big hit with my 2 year old, my 7 year old and my 31 year old husband.  We had it as a side dish, but it would also make a great breakfast quiche.

This was easy to assemble and quite good.
I didn't mix the cheese in with the egg and cream mixture.  I layed it on top after I spread the mixture onto the crust. My wife said it was gourmet!  Garnished it with salsa and snipped chives.  WOW.

Made this as directed. It was a tasty and fun change from a usual potato side dish. Easy to make and serve. It does need to bake a bit longer than 30 minutes.
I will make this again.

Loved this recipe - simple and very tasty.  I used Town House Flatbread Crisps, Roasted Garlic which made it very flavorful!  Tip:  Spray some ccoking spray on the pie dish.

This has been one of my family's most requested recipes for years and one of the first things literally gobbled up at neighborhood functions. I've used parmeson cheese as well. This vegetable side dish never fails to please onion eaters.

Very yummy, easy, and creative recipe. Even those who are not crazy about onions enjoyed it. This is delicious but it is obvious why- it is SOOO buttery. I had to double the crust to have enough. Definitely a special treat!

This is a simple recipe but the results are fabulous. I made the pie for a group picnic and it was a hit. I used Ritz crackers which were easily made in to crumbs in my Cuisinart. We don't get Vidalia onions up this way so I used Walla Walla sweets with excellent results. The pie had a mild onion flavor and was a perfect accompaniment to grilled meat. Non onion lovers enjoyed it as well. Give it a try.

OMG!  This was awsome! My friend just called to tell me a THIRD time how good this was.  This will definetly be a tradition as soon as the vidalia's come in season.  I used wheat townhouse crackers and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for a GREAT recipe !

This was the greatest recipe, thanks for posting!  I added more cheese on top and let it cook a little longer than suggested to brown the cheese and it was wonderful!  My husband and I loved it.  I will make this again!

Very rich, but good. Added 1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese and 1/2 tsp thyme to egg mixture. Also, increased the cheddar cheese to 1/2 cup.

I was a bit disappointed because it didn't turn out like the other onion pies I've had.  I followed the directions exactly, except I used saltines instead of Ritz crackers because that's what I had.  The crust was good, and a very soft texture, like bread!  The onions tasted good, too, but I think it needed a lot more of the egg mixture to hold it all together.  I would have added more, but didn't want it to overflow.  I think it would be just as good without the cheese.  I don't regret trying this one, but I'll keep looking for a great recipe!
