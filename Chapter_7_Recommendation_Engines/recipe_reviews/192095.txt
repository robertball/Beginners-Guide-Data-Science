I got this recipe off the back of the box long ago and make it once or twice a month. Adjust the taco seasoning to your liking. I brown the chicken, sprinkled with the taco mix, in a bit of olive oil.I also add cilantro and use seasoned black and pinto beans (the plain ones make this dish bland), I simmer all in the pan with the chicken , then bake it as the recipe says. Serve with rice, chips, guacamole, salsa and sour cream!

Not bad at all!  My husband and two sons had seconds, saying "mmm-mm" the whole time.  My changes (hardly worth mentioning): added a bit of taco seasoning, added diced bell pepper to the chicken/onion, used long-cooking rice, and used black beans instead of kidney.  I see this as a versatile dish, just waiting for my adjustments.  My youngest (10 yrs, extremely finicky) told me, "The next time you want to serve Mexican food, make this".  I think I'll use his suggestion.

If I based my review solely on my own interpretation, I would say this dish is "good". However, my 7 yr old son, who likes next to nothing, raved about this dinner. He rated it as a "favorite" surpassed only by ice cream. Hence, the 4+ rating. SO--my family liked this well enough to eat again. I served it alone but next time will add torilla chips or perhaps make it into wraps of some sort. I added taco seasoning, medium chili beans with sauce, black beans and omited the chicken broth. Next time I will use fiesta corn instead of regular frozen corn. We added sour cream and guacomole as desired. Not a bad meal. Easy to make. Easy to tweak to add pizzaz.

This was a very easy meal to prepare. Tasted good but could've been a little spicier.

Absolutely boring and bland. And that's WITH the taco seasoning.

Wonderful!  Quick and delicious.  I used canned chicken from costco and a little bit of taco seasoning and it was GREAT!

Great base, added some extra fluids (half broth and half water) because the rice seemed a little dry, then added crushed red pepper, salt, Cumin, and Cholula mexican hot sauce... very tasty! I think you could take this and modify it to many tastes. I like it and will make it again.
