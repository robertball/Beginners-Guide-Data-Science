We didn't like the addition of dill weed, this was a little out of place. Next time, we'll make it without it. Great way to use up excess hot dog buns in the freezer--easy way for the kids to help with dinner.

This is an nice, sweet, and simple recipe. I cut the dill down a little and added some mozzarella cheese but other than that it was great. I love the taste of hot dog bread and this did not taste sweet.

This was rich and garlicky. I added a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese to the top of mine before broiling. I used hamburger buns but any bread would work fine.

Good short-cut idea, but the white bread hotdog buns have a bit too much sugar and makes it too sweet for my taste, and though I like dill, this was a little too much dill taste.  Overall, though, not bad!

These are pretty good and very easy! I don't see why I need to buy frozen garlic toasts anymore. I made these with both hot dog and hamburger buns. I'll make these again.

Pretty good, simple garlic bread. I had a few hot dog rolls that were going to go stale so I decided to try this. I did add some grated parmesan to the mixture before spreading which boosted the flavor a bit. I would make this again if ever in the situation to have to use up leftover rolls. I baked these at 400 degrees for about 8 minutes then broiled for a minute. Thanks :)

YUM! Totally tasty. I threw a little shredded mozzarella on top, just for fun. Thanks for sharing! :)

These are really good! I wasn't sure what to expect with the use of hot dog rolls but was pleasantly surprised. The dill weed is very good with the other ingredients and they browned up perfectly under the broiler. I followed another review and added a small sprinkle of mozzarella cheese and returned to the broiler for 1 min and everyone loved this. I will be making these again. Thanks for sharing!
