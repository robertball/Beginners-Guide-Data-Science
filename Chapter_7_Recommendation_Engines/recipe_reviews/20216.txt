I worked in a famous Italian Bakery visted by even movie stars and this was their now not so secret way of keeping their cakes fresh and moist!  They made it by the gallons and added oranges cut in half during the boiling process.  They also added amaretto licqure to it.  They kept it in a bottle (wine or pop bottle will do) and sprinkled it on both the centre and top layers before icing. Just add a sprinkle to make it moist-don't soak it or you'll have a gross soggy cake.  Good Luck!

I use this syrup to brush on cake layers for extra moisture. I just flavor it to taste with whatever - whiskey, vanilla, almond, liqueur - whatever! I store mine in the refrgerator since it seems to get modly if left out.

It was easier and faster to prepare this myself than to run up to the store to buy it!! I made it in less than 4 or 5 minutes. Also, since it's equal parts of sugar and water, it's easy to remember for future!

I made this specifically for iced tea. My kids used to heap sugar by the wheelbarrow into their bitter iced tea. Now, with this, I can monitor how much sugar actually goes into the tea. I added a few drops of lemon juice, and it's great. Thanks for the recipe Shaggy!

I needed simple syrup to make mojitos the same way we make them at my bar, and this is the same recipe we use, with one exception... if you want that pretty golden color that you might associate with syrup, try using "Sugar in the Raw" (the brown, large grained, unbleached sugar) instead of white sugar. The syrup is a beautiful golden brown and a little thicker this way. My mojitos turned out great using this recipe, but you get a more syrupy texture and taste if you use "Sugar in the Raw". Just a note!

This is really easy! just pour out as much as you plan on using, or else you get crumbs in it and have to throw the rest away. A great way to put moisture on your cakes.

I made this...just for the heck of it and ended up using it in my iced tea.  It's quick and easy to remember.  I like the idea of brushing this between cake layers.  Thanks for sharing.

I use this base recipe for everything and it can be adjusted to fit lots of purposes. For margaritas I make this syrup and add lime juice to mix with tequila and triple sec. I add vanilla to this recipe to make syrup for iced coffee.   >>>>>>ONE HINT>>>>>> It is easy to make this syrup as thick or as thin as you would llike. If you want it thin follow as written and turn it off after it starts to boil. If you want a thicker syrup just cook it longer lowering the heat a little bit after it starts to boil.

I find it incredibly annoying when ignorant people down-rate a recipe just because of their lack of knowledge or experience. This is called "simple syrup" for a reason, it is supposed to be ultra sweet ... it is basically liquid sugar. If it is too sweet for your recipe ... USE A BIT LESS (don't shoot the messenger dummy)! This recipe is the BOMB, and really comes in handy. 1 tsp. (this) simple syrup = 1 tsp. sugar, period. Store it in the fridge (well-sealed) and it will keep for months. My only suggestion is that you use purified or filtered water and high-quality sugar (the clearer the result, the better).

great recipe. You can add mint leaves to the ingrediants. It's good with mojitos.  All you need to add is 1 oz. rum and 1 oz. syrup, 1/2 fresh squeezed lime and 4 oz. club soda. Rim glass with sugar and add a fresh mint leaf.

I was recently at a restaurant and ordered iced coffee, it was served with Simple Syrup.  It was nice not having to stir sugar to disolve granules.  I made mine 1 part water and 2 parts sugar for cocktails, since ice was involved, which would water this syrup down.   I stored in a glass jar for future use.  In appreciatedreading all the reviews here for the many uses.   I have also heard that freezing fresh whole fruit in this syrup stops freezer burn, and keeps color intact (ex. strawberries).

Need a fruit glaze or topping for pound cake? Just make a simple syrup and cook until it begins to boil. Simmer for five minutes and add sliced strawberries, peaches or any type berries. Spoon over cake and enjoy. It's great.

Had a martini recipe that called for MANGO SYRUP. I peeled & sliced 4 mangos. Boiled them in 6 cups of water until the liquid was reduced by half (3 cups). then strained the liquid and added 6 cups of sugar so the syrup would be thicker and sweeter. Turned out perfectly! By the way the martini recipe is: 1 shot Absolut Mandrin, 1/2 shot triple sec, 1/2 shot mango syrup, 1/2 shot cranberry juice. shake with ice and strain into a martini glass. It is similar to the Sydney's Cosmo at Outback Steakhouse.

My husband asked me to make him some "sugar water" for making homemade Whiskey Sour mix. What else is there to say about this simple, handy recipe? As others have mentioned, it's good for moistening cakes, for use in cocktails, adding flavorings to it makes it useful for coffees - this is just handy stuff to have, and couldn't be easier to make. If you add citrus juice or other extracts and boil longer til it reduces, you can make a true glaze for cakes that dries shiny and clear :) Thanks for posting this handy recipe!

Haven't seen this idea.  When I make the syrup, I always triple the recipe, or more.  Freeze what I don't use in ice cube trays.  Then when iit is party time, I freeze lemon juice, or whatever fruit I want the drinks to taste like, toss the whole works into the blender along with some chilled water, with the appropriate color for the fruit,  and  garnish, and you have an elegant 'boozeless' drink.  If you want liquor, just use that as part of the liquid.  Always an elegant pppppppppppresentation.  Jimmie

Basic simple syrup good to use in ice tea or lemonade or any drink that calls for sugar it doesnt leave a sugary texture. Also can add split vanilla bean and remove when done cooking, for a vanilla simple syrupor play around with different extracts just be sure to add them in when it is done cooking You can store in the fridge for a while.

This works well.  I've also made it with 1 part water to 2 parts sugar and used it with equal parts of lemon juice and then topped with water or soda to make perfect fresh lemonade.  I was taught to put a pinch of salt in with the sugar.  It helps pull up the sweetness.

I added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract after it cooled a bit, and I use it to put in my coffee. Tastes like the vanilla syrup used in coffee shops--fabulous!

Used "Sugar in the Raw" as a healthier alternative to refined white sugar. I used this to sweeten freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Delish! I feel so silly that I didn't realize how easy it is to make this:)

Perfect for family gatherings where everyone has their own idea of how sweet their iced tea should be.  I make unsweetened tea and put the simple syrup on the table in a cream pitcher. Everyone's happy.

Worked PERFECTLY!  I made two batches...  a plain white sugar syrup, and another with turbinado sugar (Sugar in the Raw).  I poured the turbinado syrup over crushed mint leaves.  I'll let it steep 24 hours before straining out the leaves and discarding them.
Gorgeous dark mint syrup, right on time for Derby Day!  I can offer my guests a mint julep...  OR a mojito!

When I worked at Baskin Robbins, we made our shakes with a squirt of Simple Syrup, that came in premade containers.  I'm sure this was all it was, sugar water.  Thanks for the recipe, I never thought about making it at home to get that true Baskin Robbins taste - ice cream, a little milk and a squirt of simple syrup.  Also going to try this on my cakes like the other reviews say!

Thanks for adding this Medium-thick recipe.  For those looking for a variety of syrups check out the site's page.  http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Making-Simple-Syrup/Detail.aspx  The thick version is great for Absinthe drinks.

Truly fast and easy to make. I halved the recipe and used my simple syrup to brush across three cake layers I made from scratch. I had to let the cake layers sit out to cool and cover with plastic wrap because I couldn't get to frosting the cake for a while. I wanted to make certain the cake wasn't dry so turned to simple syrup for my secret. I halved the recipe, portioned out what I need and flavored my portion I was using with a few drops of LorAnn strawberry oil for the particular cake I was making. Absolutely perfect !! I placed what I didn't use in the refrigerator. Thanks for the recipe!!

Cut this down to four servings as that all I needed for pouring over a cake. Instead of water I used Limoncello to correspond with the flavours in the cake. Simple enough, and worked well.

Thanks, I made this for mojitos, I didn't have fresh mint so I cooked some dried mint into the simple syrup, was actually pretty good:) think of the mint bits you'll drink as an added bonus! ANTIOXIDANTS! Lol. Or you can strain them.

After I made pancakes I realized we were out of syrup. I used this recipe, adding some butter and vanilla flavoring. The syrup wasn't thick but we used it on our pancakes and added a dollop of strawberry preserves to the top. Yummy. Just enough sweetness.

This is the perfect recipe for simple syrup, only I don't usually wait for the water to boil. generally speaking, plain old "really really hot" water from the tap is enough to dissolve the sugar, and you're makin' margaritas before you know it! :-)

I used a pyrex bowl in the mircowave, added 5 mint leaves and 3 tablespoons organic 100% lemon juice to it, for a great iced tea sweetener

I tried this for our mint juleps and found in cloyingly sweet. Any ideas on how I can use the extra?

So quick, so easy, and so affordable.  I hate the grittyness that sugar can leave behind in cold drinks and simple syrup is the perfect remedy to that problem.  I always knew it was easy to make but for some reason I had never tried it before now.  With a 1-1 ratio of sugar to water, the ingredients are easy to remember as well!  I added a half teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to a half batch of this syrup and used a teaspoon of it in my cold-brewed iced coffee.  Delicious!

Super easy. You can infuse with mint or citrus.  Delicious with club soda and a dash of your favorite liquor.

I can't believe I had to make a change to this one...its only 2 ingredients!!! Lol! But here goes... I made this with 2 parts sugar to 1 part water. I'm using this to make Limoncello Martini's and thats what the martini recipe said to do! Turned out great! Tastes just like sweet water!;)

Just what I needed for a drink recipe. 

Really foolproof.

EDITED 08/05/08: This makes a good substitute when you are out of coffee creamer. Just add a couple tablespoons to your coffee with a little vanilla. It even tastes better. I used it in a blended coffee drink which worked out perfectly.

I only needed a little bit, so took a shortcut by combining equal parts sugar and water in a glass measuring cup and microwaving for about 3 minutes, stirring a few times while cooking, until dissolved. So easy!

Great to have on hand in a mason jar in the fridge. If you love fresh lemonade - just add a couple of teaspoons to the juice of one lemon, add water and ice. Beats the winter blahs and the summer heat to make a fresh glass anytime you want.

Perfect, simple recipe!  We are big sweet tea drinkers in my house so I keep this on hand at all times in the fridge.  I recently made this and while heating the sugar/water mixture I added some leftover orange and lemon zest I had from making a cheesecake.  It made the whole house smell wonderful and it tastes fantastic!

Just what'cha need when a recipe calls for "simple syrup".  It's not really meant to be by itself.

I make it two cups at a time to sweeten iced tea, I add mint or oranges while it boils to flavor tea.  Beats trying to get sugar to dissolve in a cold glass, and everyone can sweeten to their own taste.

My granny used to make her syrup like this. I put just a little bit less water and after it cools down just a bit I add a tablespoon of melted butter and a splash of vanilla. Taste great on waffles/pancakes if you ever run out of the Mrs. Buttersworth. I still prefer Mrs. B but this is a good simple back up when I've prepared breakfast and notice the syrup is on back order in my pantry.

Quick, easy, and worked great. I couldn't ask for more from a recipe. It boiled in less than 1 minute to. I halved the recipe and it worked fine. I didn't wait until it was completely cool either, as I only needed a spoon or two for a mixed drink. This would be great with lemonade also. Thanks!

OOPS, I almost forgot to rate this.  I was so glad to find a recipe for it here when I needed it.  I was making the Mango Sorbet recipe on this site and I had no simple syrup.  Funny thing is that I hadn't even heard of it before so I'm basing my rating on the convenience since I have nothing to compare it to as well as reviews made by others who know what simple syrup is.

Easy to make, and works great for tea. Sometimes I like sweet tea; sometimes I don't. It's easy to just add some syrup to my glass of tea to sweeten it up, when I want it!

I just made 2 cups worth, mostly for my homemade Café Lattes. I used organic sugar - it came out great. I also had no idea you can use this on cakes! I won't be using my simple sugar for this though ... Just for lattes and sweet tea. Eat your heart out Starbucks! (wink)

A great staple to include in your kitchen! We use it for Ice Tea mostly but brushing it on cake layers is a fantastic way to add sweet moisture.

I made it and I boiled it a little bit longer so would be a little bit thicker. I also added almond extract so  I could glaze my cookies allowing the sparkling sugar to it. can't wait to cool to see how it tastes ??????

I realize there are people out there that don't know what simple syrup is. That's why they sell it in the stores and people like my "daughter" (eye roll) buys it. So easy its "Simple". I keep it in a regular syrup jar for a quick ice tea sweetener.  I use my Kurig for the hot water, 6 oz and add 3/4 cup sugar.

Easy peasy--and a very nice alternative to plain sugar for iced tea. I'll be keeping a bottle of this on hand in the fridge from now on.

I didn’t use a pan and the stove. I boiled water in my teapot and added it to the sugar in the measuring cup I used to measure the sugar. It was easy, few dishes to wash, and it dissolved well.

When I make this recipe, I put it into a syrup dispenser for easy dispensing.  I usually use it in ice tea.  For another use, I add fresh cranberries with the sugar&water, cook until they pop and then taste for the right mix of sweet & tart.

This is called a "simple" syrup for 1 reason. Even a supervised child could make this with no problems. If you can boil water, well you already know how to make this. 

I make this all the time with different flavors for homemade sodas. Put some in a glass, pour in an ounce or two of simple syrup (to taste) and fill glass with club soda. For a creamier version, add a splash of cream. This way I know exactly what's going in my drink.

I like sweet tea and my girlfriend doesn't, so I use this simple syrup to sweeten my tea all the time. Quicker, cheaper, and easier to makes it than to go to the store to buy it. And of course it's super versatile, as it also works great in cocktails and to help moisten a cake.

The name says it all. I halved the recipe since I only needed 2 tbs. Put the rest in a mason jar in the refrigerator and will use it to sweeten coffee or iced tea.

Made a ton of this and keep it in the home bar. Love it! Works great in cocktails. Easy and quick.
