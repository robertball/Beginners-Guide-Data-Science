Making a roux this dark does take time, but it's worth it. The gumbo has a rich, brown flavor that is even better the second day. I didn't skin the duck; instead, I boiled it and separated the skin and bones from the meat afterward. When I make this again, I'll let the duck broth sit overnight in the fridge so the fat can be more easily skimmed out. I will also use hot smoked sausage and a little more of the spices, because we like very spicy food.

this was the first time i made a gumbo...my husband loved it!!! this is a keeper!i had leftover duck from christmas so i scaled the recipe down to 4 and i doubled all the spices that the recipe called for because i thought it  was a little weak...and i bought hot smoked sausage..but it didn't take me 30-45 min for the rue i don't have much in the way of cookware(we're newlyweds) so i used a non stick pan and the rue was done in 15-20 min! and i didn't cook the veggies until tender because it cooked on the stove for 1h 20 min and i added extra okra...this was easy, tasty, a good change from the norm and a good base for my future gumbo endevors :) very good thank you!

This dish has been deemed an opening day tradition. An excellent recipe and relatvely easy. Just make sure you get your roux perfected and the rest is a cinch. I added file as well during the last five minutes of cooking.
