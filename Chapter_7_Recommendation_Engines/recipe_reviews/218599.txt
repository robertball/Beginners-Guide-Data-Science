This was a hit with the whole family. It converted my husband to Swiss chard and even pleased my 2 year old.

This is a nice recipe for red chard.  This was way too salty, but totally my fault.  Be careful about adding salt to taste--I am typically generous with salt in cooking, but I didn't even consider how salty the prosciutto is.  My bad.   I will make this again, but next time, I won't add any more salt or else I will eliminate the prosciutto.

A delicious and easy-to-prepare salad.  I used turkey bacon instead of proscuitto.  Next time I would probably use more swiss chard, or less turkey bacon.

Way too salty! This would be pretty good without the prosciutto.

I prepared a variation of this for Thanksgiving. I doubled the recipe, went heavy on the chard (3 bunches) and included a small onion, a little lemon juice, and grated parmesan cheese on top. Every one of dinner guests that tried it (8 of 14) thought it was very good and most had seconds. That's tall praise when there's 20+ sides on the table.  

The only reason I rate this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ratio of prosciutto is a bit high. Don't get me wrong, I *love* prosciutto, but I also like chard. Even with the extra ingredients, the prosciutto took over. I've amended my recipe to halve the prosciutto.

I used dinosaur kale instead of swiss chard.
