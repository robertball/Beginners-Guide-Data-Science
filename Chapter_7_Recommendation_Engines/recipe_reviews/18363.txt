These are very tasty! I was confused as to how to form the dough, and I think mine looked more like calzones, but they still tasted great! A tip I learned from another recipe is to gather up the opposite corners of the square-shaped dough and squeeze them together, then to put the bierrock on the cookie sheet seam side down, so it looks like a bun or ball. Hope that helps!

I made this about 5 nights ago and last night DELISH!! My husband wants to know when its on the menu again!  I made the bread dough in my breadmaker with the plain white bread recipe, I also added diced green pepper to it. I also suggest slicing the cheese, rather than grading and adding right before rolling up, as the cheese gets lost in the mix.

We used to go to a restaurant called 'My Favorite Piroshki' which specializes in beautiful sandwiches baked in bread dough. This recipe reminds us of one we ate there many times. I add some finely grated carrot and then put the cheese in after the meat cools so it won't 'disappear' into the meat mixture. I also cut the onion down to a very small amount as the flavor seemed too dominating.

Yummy!  I used butter tastin' Grands and followed the advice about keepin' it all cool for preparation.  These things baked up deliciously, and I used a little chili powder and seasoning salt to give them a little kick.  Hope Hubby likes them, if there's any left when he gets home!! :)

These were wonderful!  I left out the cheese and they reminded me of the Runzas I used to eat as a little girl in the midwest.  They freeze well and make for a quick, yummy lunch.  I enjoy bringing them to friends for lunch.  Everyone loves them.

I used the dough from "Amazing whole wheat pizza crust" submitted by Marla to make this.  The original recipe serving size of both recipes turns out to be the perfect amount to make 6-7 Bierrocks!  I also made it without cheese, it turned out great. thanks

Quite easy and yummy. I couldn't find whole frozen loaf bread, so I used frozen rolls.  I think that was easier with individual servings.  Can't wait to make again!

Very good!  After living in Toronto and Montreal for 10 years, hard to live in a small region!  I had to make this with pizza dough since it's all they had at my local grocery store.  It was good, but I know it would be better with bread. Will make again for sure, whole family loved this!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was great, easy and delicious.  You are basically making your own "Hot Pocket".  I used pizza dough in a can and it worked wonderfully.  Spiced it a little more, used a bit of garlic, cayenne, cumin and chili powder.  YUM!

wow!  these were just SO good!! we used ground turkey instead of beef, but you NEVER would have known the difference (plus it was healthier!)  also, i just used two packages of crescent rolls, pressing the seams of every two together, instead of the bread dough.  made this way, we got eight delicious and hearty bierrocks!  the only thing i'll alter in the future is the salt, cuz they seemed pretty salty.  i think maybe they'd be okay with no salt.  anyway, great as is and VERY easy using crescent rolls!

This was my first time making and eating bierrocks. They were delicious! I found it difficult to roll out the bread dough, but it was certainly worth the effort. I substituted Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage for the ground beef and then added the salt and pepper to taste, using less than 1/2 tsp. of each.

This is a solid recipe for me flavorwise, however the men in my life realy loved it so I'll be making it again. I spiced up the beef a bit before cooking. If I hadn't, I can't imagine that this would have had enough flavor (just me, I LOVE spice, it's a Texas thing). I also had problems with my dough. Next time I will go with something other than frozen bread dough. The dough would not cooperate! Make sure to buy extra frozen bread dough if you decide to make it with that: it will take two 1-lb loaves.

My family loves these.  We call them "groutburo".  A German grandma from our church gave us the recipe for these.  We add chili powder or Tex-Mex seasonings to the meat and cabbage.  We place grated cheese on top, just before closing up the bread dough.  When they have cooked, we add more grated cheese to the top and serve them with taco sauce.  Hey, we are from Texas!  These are soooo good.

Very nice! I had a whole wheat pizza dough, so I rolled it out in a rectangle and cut into eight pieces. I used a half package of onion soup mix to season the filling. Hubby liked his with spicy jack cheese in it.

Really tasty!  I searched two stores and could not find the frozen bread dough so I made my own dough using the "Honey-wheat sandwich rolls" recipe on this site. It made 12 good size portions with plenty of stuffing for each roll. I accidently used a full pound of ground beef rather than 1/2 LB. I think this recipe would have been even better if I had used the amount stated. The cabbage seemed to be lost in the mixture but that was MY mistake, not the recipe. Next time, I WILL use only the 1/2 LB ground beef. I did add chopped, fresh garlic to the mixture. I like the idea another reviewer said, to add shredded carrot which I will add next time around. I prepared my bierrocks earlier in the day and placed them in the fridge to cook later and they still turned out great. Before baking, I brushed with melted butter/garlic powder mixture. Very good meal! Thank you for submitting.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. The only change I made was adding garlic and some ground chipotle pepper to the meat mixture. The chipotle added a nice flavor w/ a little spice.

I made this very similar to the recipe as it reads. The only change I made was decreasing the salt and pepper slightly, since most people commented on that. It was salty enough with the little I added. A whole teaspoon would have killed my dinner! It needed a dipping sauce, but I don't know what I would dip it in... EDIT: I tried these reheated the next day, with plain old ketchup, and they were way better!

The filling is perfect! I'm not a fan of frozen bread so I made my own (which worked out well since I think I needed my 1.5-lb loaf anyway). I used a white bread dough but I think next time I will try wheat. Don't be afraid to experiment with the dough, there's no reason to use frozen, especially if you have a kitchen aid. :=) This is going on my favorites!

Filling was twice what was needed to use one frozen loaf. Used crescent rolls for rest of filling..did not like it. If you're going to make this, use 2 loaves of frozen bread, add 1 tbsp. worchestershire, and dip in any but yellow mustard!

This is a simple but tasty recipe. Beef and cabbage honestly does not need too much seasoning to be good comfort food. The sharp cheddar cheese really adds the extra flavor. I used Hoffman's super sharp, sliced (as per other reviewers advice,) to line the bread dough. Also, I used two cans of Pillsbury French bread dough instead of 1 lb. of frozen dough, because I also doubled the amount of lean ground beef to suit my families tastes. This was an all around pleaser! Satisfied an entire family of picky eaters.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for something different from what I normally cook and was happy with how well these turned out. I'll be putting this in my recipe box but next time I'll definitely decrease the amount of pepper, it was a bit too much for my taste. I also made my own bread dough rather than buying it.

These were very good. My fiance loved them. He said they were just like his Grandma use to make when he was a kid. Thanks for sharing. My boys even loved them and they turned their noses up at the filling before they were put in the dough. Thanks for sharing!

This is a real cabbage roll. I used premade store brand pizza dough. No cheese, but added a pouch of onion soup mix to half a head of cabbage, four large shallots, and a pound of hamburger. Removed spices, in the soup mix. 

To make them brown I used an egg wash with a splash of water right before baking, and applied with a brush. Baked in a greased casserole dish instead of cookie sheet. 

Good strong recipe, thank you.

Very easy to make, everyone Loved them. I froze the few left overs and reheated them straight from the freezer for 4 minutes. One toaster cycle later they were as crispy and tasty as they were when they came out of the oven the first time. They are now a family fav!!

Wow! I had so much doubt while I was preparing these, but they are sooo delicious. I lived in Frankfurt for 5 years, and my husband is from Hamburg-these don't strike us as particularly German. Note: one cabbage, one large onion, and two bags of refrigerator pizza dough will double this recipe. It's worth it.

I LOVE this recipe although I use store bought flaky biscuits to save time. I roll out the biscuits with a little flour, scoop filling in the center use a little water to help pinch edges together and then seal with a fork. Mine look more like an empanada. Bake for about 20 mins.  Half way through I coat with butter and then again when I take them out. 1 lb of ground beef makes about 10 biscuits. Each person usually eats 2 each. Reheats nicely the next day in the toaster oven.

Think this was good.  Slight variations that I used were ground turkey and frozen dinner roll bread instead of the loaf.

We really like this recipe.  Even the kids, who usually don't like anything with cabbage in it, ate these.

This was a good meal but not as good as I expected it to be after reading all the raving reviews.  I put in only about 3/4 teaspoon of salt and it still seemed a little too salty.  I used grands biscuits instead of the large loaf because I couldn't find one and didn't feel like making one from scratch.  It smelled great and was a decent meal, but nothing worth getting excited about!

This recipe was excellent.. Did not measure everything out, but did use everything that was called for, ended up with a little bit to much but that was good becouse we just had it on the side. In fact if folding everything in the bread is to hard, try making the filling and bread separate it turns out great. This is a recipe I will be  making again. Thank you.  Elaine

Not very good, bland tasting needs something, not sure what though.  Will not try again.
