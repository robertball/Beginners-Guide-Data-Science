I have this almost everyday except I use Al-kbous tea (finely ground). This can be found in most arabian food stores. I allow spices to simmer a bit longer before adding tea and simmer for a couple to three more minutes.I usually go for that dark amber color. Add evaporated milk and add more sugar if needed. You may prefer to use a fine hand-held strainer before serving. Traditionally it is served as is and the leaves just settle to bottom. Enjoy! And yes I agree.. it IS addictive because it is sooo yummy. Remember, you can make this however you want until it is juuuuust right. :)

Very good.  It's great to serve to guests, but I make it for myself as well.  It's a nice way to have a quiet moment in our busy lives.   I made it as directed, except I use a variety of good black tea in place of the orange pekoe -- all of them work well.

This is beyond could become, it is addictive. I've done it more often without the tea to eliminate the caffeine factor and I like it just as much.

I just made this for the 1st time and think it great stuff. I did not have the suggested tea, thus I used a Bigelow - White tea with Tangerine and it turned out fantastic. I will make it again! It does take a few minutes to make, however it is well worth the effort. Thanks for the contribution to "AllRecipes".

Dear Hollywood Andrews,
I am looking for Al-kbous tea. I am in the Los Angeles area and with "Hollywood" in your name, I'm hoping you are in LA too. Even if you are not, could you tell me where you found the Al-kbous tea? thanks!

OMG.  This could become addictive.
