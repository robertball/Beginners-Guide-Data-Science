Very simple! Plus, it was quick and easy for lunch! Since the chicken doesn't marinate in the oil and vinegar mixture it doesn't penetrate through so it merely "coats" the outside. I did cut back on the amount of seasoned salt sprinkled over the chicken while grilling using it just to taste and chose to grill with fresh rosemary as opposed to dried to give the chicken a smoky flavor. I didn't grill the tomato or lemon. I sliced my tomato and served it along side the chicken with a bit of salt, cracked black pepper and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Overall, very good when you don't have time to marinate.

Very good, especially since it doesn't have to marinade.

I received Lawry's Seasoned Salt as well as the Seasoned Salt marinade and Balsamic Herb marinade for free, as a Bzz Agent, and we made this recipe. It was really easy, and a great flavor combination. Next time I will probably serve it with something like polenta. Other grilled veggies like zucchini and summer squash would be great additions too.

I didn't have seasoning salt, so I just sprinkled granulated garlic, black pepper and salt on chicken thighs to my taste. I omitted tomatoes and lemon. It was flavorful. We will cook it again.

This chicken is SO delicious and SO easy! My husband makes it, and he is normally terrified of cooking. We eat it alone as a main dish or cut up in a Greek salad for a lighter meal. Seriously this chicken is really good.
