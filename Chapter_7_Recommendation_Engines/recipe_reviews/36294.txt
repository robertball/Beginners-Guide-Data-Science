Good burger. I added some minced onion to the mix.I like the idea of adding bacon to the beef before grilling.

I really only thought these were okay.  I couldn't really taste anything special about this and for the amount of work probably won't bother again.

I made these for dinner and added chopped onion to the burger (like several others had suggested).  We thought these were juicy and delicious -- not bland like most burgers.  We'll have these over and over.

This was a wonderful recipe.  Made this on a whim because I had all the ingredients at home.  These turned out juicier and more flavorful than any burger I had ever made! I also added a little bit of dried minced onion, delicious!!!!

The flavor of these was very good, although I'm still trying to find a burger that stays juicy when it's cooked to the recommend temp (my paranoid hubby grills them to "well done" in case of salmonella - can't be too careful when young kids and elderly will be eating, as we had at our family picnic), and probably because of that, these seemed kind of dry to me. I'm sure had he not cooked them so long, they would have tasted better, or maybe if I'd added chopped onion to the mix, instead of minced, that would have helped. I did like mine, especially topped with tomato, lettuce, and mustard, but I wasn't blown away (like I hoped I would be). We might try them again when it's just us, and not cook them so long, see if that helps. Smelled great cooking though!

These burgers were definately juicy but next time I will omit the dill. It just didn't taste right.
