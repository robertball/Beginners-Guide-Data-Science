I wish you had a rating higher then Five stars. This recipe is excellent! I did add black beans and kidney beans because my daughter said otherwise it wasn’t taco soup. I added more taco seasoning, and I used cream cheese instead of what they recommended. It’s what I had, and the stores are pretty bare. I highly recommend this recipe

This recipe was excellent. I didn’t change a thing. My wife has 0 tolerance for spiciness. She took one bite and declared it was too spicy for her. I, on the other hand, thought it had the right level of bite to it. I have to eat the whole batch myself...tough job but someone has to do it.

I made this tonight but in my instant pot. Sauteed the onion and green pepper, then added all the other ingredients except the cheese, and I didn't bother coating the chicken - just dumped in the spices. Set to 15 minutes with a 10 minute natural release then quick release remaining pressure.
 I changed to vegetable stock because it's what I have that is gluten free for the celiac in the family, and added a can of black beans. I had about double the chicken and it made 8 servings. Like others I used cream cheese, too.
It was a total hit and most of us had seconds, and I was asked to make it again.

This was really good. I used costco's shredded rotisserie chicken breasts and regular cream cheese. We added crispy tortilla strips to the top when we served it . They were a great addition. I cooked it on the stovetop since the chicken was already cooked. Family loved it and there was less than a 1/2 cup left. I've been told to save this one!

I followed the recipe as is and my family loved it. My opinion is to start with a recipe like this and not change it until you’ve tried it first, to get the original. Then maybe tweak to a personal taste. I see others adding beans, garlic, cream cheese not Neufchâtel, etc. I think the garlic might change it too much, but corn or beans might work. I wasn’t sure which green peppers to get as they’re labeled hot or nothing. I went with the not hot and it was plenty spicy enough. Our  crock pot isn’t quite large enough (4quart?) for it- had to ladle out a little by time cheese got added, so I think slow cooking on stove would work.

I made this on the stovetop as I was using precooked chicken (leftovers from a roast chicken).  I added the seasoning directly into the soup pot since I didn't need to coat uncooked chicken.  I used cream cheese since that is what I was able to find in the store, and I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) since we like them.  I will probably also add frozen corn in the future.  I like to do the majority of my cooking over the weekend so I put together everything up to adding the cream cheese ahead of time.  When it was time to prepare the week-day dinner, I pulled the soup pan out of the refrigerator, heated up the soup, and then added in the softened cream cheese and stirred until melted.

I’m doing it in the instapot. I will add the cream cheese after the cooking process. I tasted before pressurizing it and it had a lovely taste. I made adjustments to use what I had on hand. Like mushrooms. I diced them up super small as they provide anti-oxidants and also anti-viral and Small diced carrots. And for extra fun, I’m adding ramen noodles just because....but the base flavors are spot on!

Very good with a few adjustments.  No salt added,  probably tripled the taco seasoning, used cream cheese and added jalapenos.  next time will use less chicken broth.

Good!  I used twice the chicken since I had it thawed.  Added twice the spices since I had more chicken.  I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before adding to the cooker so there was no need to shred it.  Will be making this again!

Mine came out too rich-flavored for my wife's or my tastes.   I think that's mainly because of how much Neufchatel cheese it calls for -- if I make it again, I'll reduce the cheese by half, and probably reduce the cream of mushroom soup by half, as well, and add another cup of chicken broth.   Also,  I added 15 oz cans each of black beans and corn to mine, which helped with texture and appearance.

Absolutely delicious! I call it White Chicken Chili, however. Used cream cheese and cream of chicken soup (hate mushrooms) instead. Would’ve used cream of bacon instead because BACON makes everything even better but the store was out of it. Do yourself a favor and add a can of drained corn. This is delicious just as it’s written, I’m sure. These are the subs I made however and it was BOMB!

This soup was delicious, my son and husband both loved it too.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom and I used a yellow pepper instead of a green one. Everything else was per the recipe.  I will definitely make this again. Next time I might add some frozen corn.  It’s a great winter soup recipe.

It was really salty but still very good. I served it over tortilla chips(as we do our hamburger taco soup), which probably added to the saltiness. We topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream. Next time we will serve over rice. Will definitely make again but I will add some black olives.

This was a great soup. I too added the black beans and corn used chicken tenders cut in small pieces rather than shredding chicken. Just easier for me.   I used cream cheese since I had it and topped with tortilla strips and crispy jalapeños ( a salad topper) for those who like a little spice. Will definitely make this again.

This was AMAZING! We loved it! I did end up making a pot of rice and adding it to it at the end just to be really hardy and have a little bit of a starch/carb in there and I think it helped feel like a complete meal, but even without the rice it has a delicious rich flavor! We froze half for later and it froze really well too! I did leave out the extra chili as the Rotel has some already and I am not into super spicy. I felt like I could still tast the chili flavor just fine and it had a soft warm heat to the profile without it being spicy. It was a good balance for wimps

I made this exactly as the recipe described and the soup was very, very vinegar-y.  To the point where I could not eat it.  I can't imagine what ingredient made it so sour.  The Ro-tel tomatoes?
Anyway, I won't be making it again.

I slow cooked this over 8 hours on low because I had to work all day. Used the full packet of taco seasoning. Looked a little well cooked when I got back. So I added a can of corn and a can of black beans, both undrained. Shredded the chicken. Mixed in the Nue. cheese. It was SO GOOD. My picky kids raved about it and we are definitely making this again. FIVE STARS!!

I had an hour til dinner - no time to run to the store, and no time to slow cook a meal either, but this sounded simple and "doable" with great reviews, so I decided I could risk doing it, even though I would have to make do with a lot of substitutions.  It ends up being a very easily modified recipe - very forgiving! I had it on the table in 40 minutes, start to serve!  Served to my husband and two adult daughters, and all of us loved it!  We even have enough left for hubby and I to have it for lunch tomorrow!  To make, I first did the onions, peppers, (and three cloves of minced garlic while I was at it) in the bottom of a Dutch oven, right on top of the stove.  Other substitutions: I had no cream cheese, so I used a whole little tub of onion and garlic Philly flavored cream cheese in the little oval container instead - it was perfect. Not economical, and I'm gonna miss the Philly on my bagels this week, but oh well!  My gluten free twins were the ones coming for supper, so I had to make "fake" Cream of soup so it could be GF.  I simply made a cup's worth of white sauce using corn starch for the thickener, added some finely chopped mushrooms to it for extra flavor, some extra herbs and seasonings, and no one knew the difference.  In fact, my hubby dislikes mushrooms, but he didn't even know they were in there.  I had lots of little baggies full of chopped white meat,  dark meat, and sliced breast meat in the freezer, each in one cup portions.  (I buy two Costco rotisserie b

this was the best tortilla soup ever especially if you love "spicy"!! I lived in texas for 35 years so I do, but my husband did not care for it as much. So, I added some more chicken broth , another two cups and it was bearable for him. If you don't like spicy; suggest only 1/2 can of rotelle and skip the chiles. I still rate it a 5!!!!

I used real butter instead of oil. I used half of the bell pepper and onion amounts listed. I also used green onion instead of a regular onion. I also added one cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I cooked it on top of the stove for 30 minutes because my rotisserie chicken was already cooked. It was awesome. Very rich!  A little goes a long way.

Awesome! Will make again. Added a can of black beans,  half a can of roasted corn, and some olives. Soicier than I thought but not too bad at all!

I did alter the recipe.  I don't like shredding my own chicken.  So.... I used can chicken and did this on the stove.  I did everything else the same.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

OUTSTANDING. Due to reduced meat availability, I used 1/2 the suggested chicken and added 4 torn corn tortillas.  I can’t wait to make this again!

What a great soup! I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting half the salt. Glad I did too. Of course, the southern girl in me had to serve it over cornbread instead of topping it with tortilla strips. Maybe  next time.

This does not have to be done in a slow cooker! Start with the spices and oil. Get about 1/2 cup of flour on a plate and coat the chicken and shake as much as you can back off the chicken. Dredge it through the oil and spices then straight into a medium heat pan.  I placed stock and cream of mushroom soup in a separate skillet to bring to a boil. Then when chicken is 90% done pull it out and cube it if you don’t want to shred. Put onions and peppers in pan with chicken juices. When these are done add chicken diced tomato and green chilies to pan. Add stock to the chicken and veg. Bring everything to a boil and add the cream cheese in cubes to the soup and simmer until melted....

This soup was delicious and very easy. Because of the high sodium content, I used water instead chicken broth and only used one teaspoon of salt instead of two.  Out of necessity, I made my own taco seasoning (from this site) and reduced the salt in that, as well.  The soup was plenty flavorful.  If this was all I did, it would still have been a 5 star recipe; however, I made the following additions, just because I had the things on hand and thought, “Why not?”: extra can of rotelle tomatoes; finely diced celery and carrots; rinsed black beans; topped each serving with a dollop of guacamole and some crushed tortilla chips. (So much for the sodium content!)  A wonderful recipe, nonetheless.

Made ie exactly as the recipe and it tasted delicious except for the cream cheese did not melt like it was supposed to and enhance the flavor and texture.  I tried to smash it up but then it just broke into little pieces (chunks) and looked like cheese curds.  Very unappetizing look to it.  Wonder what I did wrong?  I actually used full fat cream cheese as others  have stated they used.

I added extra cumin to the recipe and it gave it a little kick, which is what we wanted.  I also added some tortillas.  Next time, I would probably use two cans of Rotel.  This was very good.

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup but had some mushrooms so I added them to the mix.  I worried about how creamy it would be as I didn't have a full package of the cream cheese, but it was still awesome. Very filling.  I will definitely make this again.

I could not find neufchatel so I used cream cheese.  It was a major hit. They ate it over baked potatoes as a topping and as a filling in a burrito.  We also loved it as a soup with chips!  I would love to thicken it a little bit though!

I made this for something different to our Cinco De Mayo menu. It was a hit! Not a fan of cream of mushroom so I used chicken instead. I also discovered too late that I did not have any type of diced tomatoes. It was still good. I probably used more than 1 lb of chicken & was concerned would not have enough liquid. Found a fan of cream of sweet corn ( soup NOT creamed corn) & added that as well. This is also seems to be one of those recipes that tastes better the next day. I enjoyed it the 1st day but day 2 (& even 3) after the flavors melded together more was even better!

I made a few tweaks. Used cream of chicken soup instead, replaced cumin with onion powder, chili powder and cayenne pepper. It was incredibly yummy.  I accidentally used the whole packet of taco seasoning but it was fine. I will make this again soon and may even add a can of black beans.  (makes me wish I had a larger crock pot for sure)!!! Thanks Yoly

I made my own broth for less salt by cooking a triple batch of chicken in 6 cups of water with the spices tripled.  When cooked through, so removed all but the required chicken and broth.  I also added a can of corn and served with tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream.  The family loved it and I have the extra chicken and broth for another recipe.  Quite easy and delicious!

This recipe is a wonderful base recipe that one can vary to one's taste.  We don't like (our mouths & stomachs) much heat at all so I didn't include ANY of the spicier elements.  I just doubled the taco seasoning.  I did use just 1.5 tsp of salt.  It was even more tasty the second day!  My husband congratulated me on such a good choice.

I made it on the stovetop, cooking it for about an hour on low heat after bringing it to a simmer.  It was salty enough without adding the extra salt so I left that out.  I added a can each of black beans and pinto beans, and about 1 cup of water. The cream cheese did not melt completely, but that just gave us little pockets of creaminess to enjoy.  Hubby went back for seconds so it's a keeper.

GREAT RECIPE!!!  Super easy.  Like others, I used pre-cooked (turkey) during the last 45-60 mins on high and cream cheese instead of the other.  Added 1/2 minced Jalapeno with the onion mixture and nearly blew us out- just had another beer.
Will DEFINITELY make again.  I can see it would be super for a big crowd too.

I gave it a four because I made some changes..I used a half pound of hamburger because I needed to use some up and I added a large. Potatoe. I think I will add some black beans next time. I almost always add additional things to recipes as I try to eat less meat and a lot more vegetables so nothing unusual for me. I also added some flour to thicken it up a bit. Had a great flavor though and will make it again as my husband loved this recipe

This soup was delicious.  I didn’t have time to wait for the slow cooker so I made it on the stove.

I googled slow cooker chicken recipe while at the grocery store. Decided to try this and it was a hit! I used cream cheese instead of the fancy French cheese that I had no idea what it was and found cream cheese to be a good substitution. Family loved it. Had a nice kick to it without being too spicy.

Very delicious.  I would worn chefs that this recipe has a kick to it.  So if hotness is a problem, cut back on peppers.

Great recipe as is! You can also put your own twist on it. We all love this recipe, which includes 3 kids (one picky eater) Sometimes I add a can of corn and black beans. So yummy. Usually eat by adding shredded cheese and sour cream per preference and tortilla chips on the side.

This recipe is a keeper. Based on other comments, I substituted Cream Cheese for Neufchatel Cheese.  I also added a can of corn (drained) and a can of seasoned black beans (rinsed and drained).  I have an older crock pot and it did take longer to get the chicken done. I garnished with sliced avocado and served with beef chalupas. My soup was thick and hardy,  and delicious.

Wonderful...No changes.  But as we weren’t eating it fast enough, I drained off a lot of the liquid, froze the bulk ....later I thawed it out, wrapped it in a burrito shell, heated it and covered it melted white cheese with drained Rotel, and it was like an unFried chimichanga!!! YUMMY 2 ways!!!

For my seasoning I did one full packet of taco seasoning along with salt and pepper to taste and it achieves the same the flavor if not MORE! Super good with tortilla chips. My family also wanted the soup a little spicy so I did Hot ROTEL and it was a great substitute.

This was way too much spice! We love spicy food and after taking one bite no one could eat it! It took way longer to cook than it says and is not worth the time. I would recommend using less spice and more cream base to tone it down. If the spice was not so overpowering the taste itself would be good.

Yum! Had to use up some cooked chicken, had all the ingredients except the peppers .  Added crushed red pepper to substitute ( I love heat, and it was just the ticket).  Skipped the slow cooker.Added the ingredients meant for the  chicken  seasoning right to the dutch oven with all other ingredients. Sauted onions first, added cooked  chicken last til heated thru. I left out salt because the  chips I served with it had more than enough.   One pot on the stovetop (with precooked chicken), so quick, putting into my rotation.

Wow!!! So much flavor! I added corn and black beans. Increased chicken to 1.5 lbs cuz why not. But that didnt change the flavor which was absolutely fantastic! The neufachâtel (sp?) is less sweet than cream cheese and highly recommended. This is by far one of the best recipe results I have had in a while. Thanks for sharing!

Arguably the most delicious thing I've made since I started using Allrecipes.com. I doubled the quantities and used cream cheese instead of the recipe and added two cans of beans. This will max out a 6-qt slow cooker so I'm debating looking for a slightly larger one.  Highly recommend!

I added one can of corn, a can of ranch style beans, a dash of garlic powder, twice the amount of taco seasoning, half of a small block of Velveeta, and cream cheese instead of Neufchâtel cheese. I also used chicken thighs instead of breast. Added it all to the crockpot and cooked it on low all day. Not bad. Served with sour cream, hot sauce, green onion, and tortilla strips.

Giving it 4 stars because I added a can of Ranch beans and Mexicorn which I think it needed. I used thin sliced chicken breasts and the chicken was not done after 2 hours on High. So my husband grilled the chicken to get it done, then shredded it and put it back in. Needed to cook another 45 minutes to get the rest of soup to temp. It was really good with tortilla strips on top too.

Made this last night and loved it. But I did make some changes to make it a bit healthier and heartier. 

I don't see any reason to add oil to the spices for the chicken when you're throwing it into stock. I just seasoned the chicken and put it in. 

I used almost 4 cups chicken stock. Also added a can of black beans, and then later added frozen corn and frozen chopped spinach at the same time as the cream cheese (which I also used light). Turned slow cooker up to high and it was done a half hour after. 

With these changes, we got 5 or 6 BIG servings and it was surprisingly low calorie and soooo good.

The recipe as-is would probably be tasty too but I like to make things a bit healthier when I can.

Delicious! I chose not to use the slow cooker. I used my cast iron skillet to grill the seasoned chicken, shred it, then toss it in the juices in the iron skillet before adding to the soup. I chopped a bell pepper, 1 jalepeno, and an onion and simmered them in oil in a stock pot until tender before adding the chicken stock. Also just boiled 3 Roma tomatos and peeled them, juiced them, chopped them up and added with the chicken stock. I think the sautéed veggies and cast iron add an extra layer of flavor. Also queso fresco as a topping and corn tortillas on the side paired excellent. Thinking of adding corn to the sautéed veggies next time, thanks for the recipe! Hubby and I gobbled it up!

I used cream cheese and had to make the cream of mushroom soup from scratch since I didn't have any on hand but wanted to make this for tonight's supper.   I added chili powder and increased the cumin.  Not bad, quick and easy.  I made it on the stove.

Delicioso! We made the recipe as advertised, and loved every bit of it. It’s pretty hearty. We served it over rice with a refried bean/kidney bean combo and broccoli on the side. We all went back for seconds.

I didn’t use a slow cooker and used rotisserie chicken and this came together so quick and was absolutely delicious! I also had some left over cilantro and a bit of jalapeño so I threw them in and it brightened this up even more! Will definitely be making again!

Since I love King Ranch Chicken and the recipe sounded so good, I made this and it was delicious. Since I'm cutting back on salt due to husband's high blood pressure, I only used the 1 tsp for the broth mixture. Next time I will omit all additional salt. I used cream cheese instead of Neufchatel since the store did not have Neufchatel -- I guess a COVID-19 panic sell out product. I garnished with a dollop of sour cream in which I had added fresh minced garlic; some lime powder (you could use lime juice); and crushed corn tortilla chips. Yummy!! Oh yeah. I used my Instant Pot slow cooker function on "Normal" -- since "Normal" is "Low" on my Instant Pot. I cooked for the 3 hours and chicken was not up to temp, so I cooked for an additional 2 hours on Normal.

really easy and tasty! I used my Instant Pot to make it even faster, adding all the ingredients except the cream cheese, which to make it lactose free I use a vegan cream cheese substitute (available at Aldi) and a vegan cream of mushroom soup, and I even use frozen chicken breasts,  cook on high pressure for 18 minutes, then I add the cream cheese substitute on the saute setting for a few minutes. this is a very versatile recipe, sometimes I add black beans, corn, etc. Top with tortilla chips and sliced avocado, yum! be warned, it's pretty spicy :)

I made this, but since it was my first time buying Rotel Tomatoes with green chilies, I didn't know that there were different chilies levels.  Hence I sent my husband out and he came home with the 
"Original" Rotel and wow was it spicy!  This is definitely a keeper for the recipe book, but next time I will make sure that it's the Mild can and not the Original.  Otherwise, we loved it and thank you for sharing!

I did this on the stovetop in about 35 minutes- cooked the chicken separately, added the spices to the soup mixture while everything was simmering and then shredded the chicken and added it at the end with the cream cheese. It was easy and everyone in my family loved it!

Gotta admit I was skeptical when it used cream of mushroom soup, but this was awesome! I made just as written with the exception of using hot rotel tomatoes instead of regular because I love spicy, and I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because they’re more tender. Will definitely make again. I might try cream of chicken soup instead and see how that tastes.

This was the first soup I have ever made from scratch. After reading the reviews, I decided to stick exactly to the recipe. It was so delicious!!  My husband’s only recommendation was smaller chicken pieces so I plan to shred it finer next time. My teenage son added Tabasco to his and was very happy. Highly recommend. I fed three for dinner, with a side of grilled cheese. There is enough left for four or five more bowls this week. We will be enjoying it again.

1st pot, 4 stars as written. 2nd pot, 5 stars with my changes: No salt, used home canned tomatoes and a 7 oz can green chilies, low sodium mushroom soup, no oil, 1 can kidney beans. Also both times I cut chicken bite size so as not to have to shred later and added spices into pot. A keeper with changes! May add 1/2  Tbls. more taco seasoning next time for a bit more kick.

This was really good! I sauteed the pepper (used a red pepper} and onions before I put them in the crock pot just to soften them up and I also added two cans of chicken broth which was probably a little more than was called for. This will definitely be added to the dinner rotation!

I made this soup without any changes being done to it ( I didn't want to unfairly rate  this recipe with any changes made to it)  I have to say this is  a great recipe .  It was so creamy and flavorful and not  spicy at all.  I will be making this again except next  time I will add  jalapenos for some heat!

Followed the recipe but added a cup of diced carrots, 1.5 cups black beans, and frozen corn and about 1/2 cup rice (rinsed) to bulk it up,  and hot Chili flakes as all I had. Cooked in the instant pot for 15 minutes, quick released then added 4 oz cream cheese and a splash of half & half. This was very good, will definitely make again.

Delicious and easy!  Made as directed, except used our family's substitute for condensed soup and added a can of red beans (for extra fiber, protein, and to help stretch).  Put in crock pot at 3:30 in the afternoon and it was ready to serve by 6:30 pm, just in time for dinner!  Three out of four kids loved it (bean hater did not).

Very tasty, and super yummy with the tortilla chips on top. I had to take it out of the slow cooker at the end and finish cooking it in a pot and used cream cheese.  Will slow cook it longer next time and use less cheese, but very impressed with the end result. Side note:  We had it the next day as well and the flavours really kicked in.  What an amazing taste this is.  I am definitely going to make it again, even if it isn't the most pleasant looking meal I have made.

Very tasty. I followed the recipe other than not adding the can of green chilies because I didn’t have any and used cream cheese. We ate it with crushed tortilla chips on top. Still seemed it was missing something as it was not very hardy. Perhaps beans as other suggested. It was easy enough for sure.

This is a base for a good soup....I sauteed the onions, peppers and garlic(don't have to use but its good in this)  I cut the chicken breast and did the seasoning thing but it washed off in the soup....so skip this step and just add the seasoning...skip the oil...leave out the extra salt....there is enough salt in the taco seasoning, speaking of taco seasoning, 1 T  is not enough....it could stand the whole bag or 3 TBSP.....but go easy to start....I used a partial brick of cream cheese and it did not want to melt so I had to smash it in the soup....I added some pepper cheese which melted right in....add some beans....(I had some red kidney beans already cooked) like black beans (rinse) and toss in....you could use ground beef or roast beef in this soup....at the end test for salt.....

This is a great base recipe to make your own. The only substitute was that I added 4 oz of cream cheese and thought it was great. We like thicker soups/stews so I added a can of black beans and corn after rinsing them and had leftover rice to add. Made it even better. Thanks again. Will definitely make it again.

This was amazing! I made a few modifications and used my Instapot. I used a rotisserie chicken from Sam’s Club. I used an entire packet of low sodium taco seasoning. I sautéed? my onions and bell pepper in the Instapot. I also added half a bag of shredded sharp cheese. I put all Ingredients in the Insta pot and set it? on Soup for 15 min with a natural release. Much better the next day after it’s sat! I plan to make this again!

So I have made plenty of taco and tortilla soups in the past. I was skeptical as to why cream of mushroom soup would be in taco soup.  However, because this recipe had been rated five stars consistently I made it tonight for dinner. It was terrific!  Although, I like trying new recipes this will be the end of making any new taco soup recipe.  I followed  the recipe almost exactly,  I added one extra cup of chicken broth and added a can of black beans.   There was hardly any soup left!  Next time around I will double the recipe. Along with the soup I made cheddar jalapeño cornbread another new recipe which will be a keeper. as well.  Bravo!!!

I used mild green chilis and mild Rotel tomatoes. I added a small can of white corn, drained, a can of black beans rinsed. A 1/2 Serrano pepper on the side because my husband likes heat but the kids don’t. I topped it with Monterey Jack cheese, some chopped cilantro and tortilla chips. Everyone approved!

I increased the chicken to 1-1/2 lbs and cooked it an hour longer. I must have a “slow” slow cooker. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and the result was fabulous. This one is a keeper.

Loved how easy this is, and pretty quick for a slow cooker recipe. Family loved this soup. I followed recipe exactly and it turned out really good. I cut a tortilla Into thin strips and shallow fried them till crispy. Topped soup with them. Added a wonderful crunch element to soup. Will make again.

This was AMAZING! Such great flavor. The only thing I added was some black beans. When I make it again, I think I'll puree some additional beans to add more thickness. I'd hate to add more cheese simply for health reasons.

This was fantastic! This is a keeper for sure! The only change I made was to add an extra tablespoon of taco seasoning. I also set my crockpot on High. Note: I needed the soup to be bubbling well in order for the Neufchatel cheese to eventually melt.

Making it today for the second time in two weeks. I doubled the batch and used 3 pounds of chicken so it comes out thicker like a stew and makes a complete meal! I share it with my elderly in-laws who are sheltering at home during this COVID-19 outbreak. They’ve never had anything like it before and are requesting more!

This incredibly simple recipe gave me two big "family wins!"

My family loved this!!!! DD (12 y.o.) who barely eats anything had two bowls and said, "It would be OK if you made this again." High praise indeed!

My other DD (14 y.o.) who dislikes chicken except when disguised had to be cut off so the rest of us could eat some. Later, my leftovers for lunch "mysteriously" vanished.  

I did need to make a couple of adjustments given that we are pantry cooking in quarantine.  I used 2 c. of a frozen onion and peppers mixture, cream of chicken soup, and the can of chicken broth I had was 14.5 oz, not 16 oz. I also used the fire roasted diced tomatoes with chilis. This recipe is very forgiving and the substitutions worked well.

One note: I tried cooking the recipe on low for two hours and the chicken was still 90% raw. I wonder if the recipe should have been 2 hours on high. Then again, maybe it was the frozen onions and peppers I used. At any rate, I plan to set aside 4 hours for cooking next time, beginning with 2 hours on high and going from there.

Very good.  I forgot to add the cheese at the end and it was still good.  However, I added cheese to the leftover and it was very good.  I would use less salt as the taco seasoning is usually very salty.  Definite keeper.  Oh, I shredded the chicken after it cooked.  Served with tortilla chips.

I love this recipe! I have prepared slow cooker chicken taco recipes before, but this was different. It’s now my FAVORITE! I love the added ingredient CREAM OF MUSHROOM soup, which I normally do not use. This dish was incredibly flavorful. When adding the two diced up Jalapeño chili peppers, I made sure I added ALL of the Jalapeño seeds as well, which made it extra hot/spicy. Yummy!!

I would definitely make this recipe again. I followed the recipe as is( except for the slow cooker part), and it was delicious. I usually have to add or reduce portions, but not with this recipe.

This recipe was so good I even shared with my friends and family.

Thank you.

I could eat this every day. It’s so good. Only change I made was to use cream cheese and two taco seasoning packets.  Sprinkled some tricolor tortilla strips on top and it was absolutely delicious. It took longer than 2-3 hours for chicken to cook but my crockpot might be on it’s last leg.

I used already cooked rotisserie chicken and left out the bell pepper and green chiles. Leftover soup works great as a dip for tortilla chips if you add extra shredded cheese and salsa.

This was a fun soup. I made it in the slow cooker as directed. It took longer than expected to cook the chicken which wasn’t a problem because I made it the day before serving it anyway so timing wasn’t an issue and one reviewer said it was better the second day so I planned around that.

It had lots of flavor from the spices without having too much heat.

A rich and delicious soup.  Easy to put together and we were amazed at the way it smelled and tasted but it was missing something so I added a can of Bush’s Chili Beans and that added just the right extra touch of flavor.  I served it with extra pepper, a few drops of hot sauce and tortilla chips.  I’ll add roasted corn too next time I make it.

This recipe is the bomb! Both my husband and I loved it. I had leftover chicken so made this in a pot on the stove top. I first sauteed onions and peppers together, added three cups of chicken broth, and all the remaining ingredients with the exception of additional salt and the canned green chiles. I just didn't happen to have any on hand. As One reviewer suggested, I did add black beans and also added 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro. This soup was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to make it again!

OMG this recipe is amazing . I diced the chicken breast into cubes and then tossed in oil and spices. 
Also, I only used half a brick of  cream cheese. It was plenty creamy enough and the flavor is sooo good. 
This is going to be a regular for me. Try It!

This IS a terrific recipe! I opted to add two boneless chicken thighs as well as the breasts along with one small can of mild green enchilada sauce, and a generous amount of minced garlic!  It came out a wee bit more like a stew, which was just fine and it did NOT last long!  Made it again two days later left out the thighs and it was more "soup-like" had the same great flavor!  This is a winner for sure in my house! ENJOY

Delicious!  Didn't have diced tomatoes with chilies, so used plain diced but added a can of salsa verde.

So very easy and so tasty. And, If you are adventurous you can mix things up with this soup by adding whatever else you like. I just love this   I will definitely make it again. Whenever I make it it will always be a bit different.

I loved it, but for some of my family members it was a little too spicy for them, so next time I’ll add less peppers.

I really enjoyed it and will probably make it again. My boyfriend wanted it to be more "chili-esque" so I added a small can of corn and a can of Bush's Southern Style White Beans, which made it thicker. We used pretty large chicken breasts, so we needed to cook it for 3.5 hours before it was up to temp. We wish is had just a little more kick, so we'll probably add paprika or chili powder next time.

I made this and it was delicious :) Next time though I will add a can of black beans and corn to give it more sustenance. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this once before where I made it exactly as written, and it was phenomenal.  However, I love to have lots of leftovers for eating or freezing, so I just kept adding the ingredients in multiples until it looked about right and filled up my large crock pot.  I first made the chicken in the instant pot with 2 cups of broth on the trivet.  I sprinkled the taco seasoning (whole packet) and the cumin, salt, and pepper on a plate and just coated each side of the chicken breast before laying it on the trivet.  I sauteed the peppers and onion in butter and then added the rest of the ingredients to the crock pot, including the shredded chicken when it was finished.  I basically doubled everything but I know I put a lot more chicken broth in there so it would have more substance.  Even with just eyeing the extra ingredients, I ended up with a large crock pot full of good, ingredient-dense soup.   I also used a whole brick of regular cream cheese and added a can of fiesta nacho cheese soup. Served it with Fritos, cheese, and sour cream, and it was the bomb!

This soup’s flavor is outstanding, but even though I used “mild” everything, it was too spicy.  Next time, I will save a couple of steps and use rotisserie chicken.  I will try cream cheese next time to see if it will melt better than what the recipe suggests, which didn’t melt at all!

This recipe was excellent.   I actually screwed up while I was reading it.   When I was mixing the homemade taco seasoning that I made, not only did I forget to add the oil but I completely missed the part about coating the chicken with it so I ended up throwing it in the pot.   I whipped up another batch, also forgetting to add the oil, to coat the chicken with.   The end result, if you like a spicy, over powering Mexican taste, give my blunder a try.

I loved this soup!  I used previously cooked and pulled chicken I had left from chicken noodle soup earlier in the week - which made it extra easy!!!!  (Also I don't care for cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of celery.). It was super tasty.  Next time I decided to try it without the chicken completely and sub in roasted cauliflower!  Can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe. I made this on the stove top because I wanted it quicker and I didn't trust myself to adapt it to the instant pot. I didn't make any omissions or substitutions to this recipe, but I did make some additions. First I added a chopped zucchini because I had one that needed to be used, although the recipe definitely doesn't need it. I also added a tablespoon of chili powder and a can of black beans at the advice of previous reviewers. Very yummy! Even my one-year old loved it. Will gladly be making this again.

Very good recipe! I had to make a few changes due to husband's taste preferences, but overall, this came out hearty and delicious. I served it with a cornbread recipe from this site and it was delicious!

I followed directions, even purchased the cream cheese recommended, but I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  Cooking the chicken on low for 2.5 hours wasn't long enough; the cream cheese also didn't completely melt.  Very strange.  Over all, I didn't like the taste.

Best recipe I have made in ages. I added some mexi corn and next time maybe some black beans. I served it with some shredded Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream, crumbled blue corn chips and a few chunks of fresh avocado. If you have non soup lovers in your household use some of the broth in white rice and serve from the crockpot with a slotted spoon onto the rice.

This is delicious! I came across this recipe while searching for a different one - it was almost suppertime and I ended up making this with my Instant Pot - just sauted the veggies, threw in the rest of the ingredients, and then set the Instant Pot for 7 minutes on the soup setting. Added the cream cheese right before serving. Everyone loved it!
