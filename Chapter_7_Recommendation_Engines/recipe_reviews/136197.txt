This was delicious, perfect after our big turkey Easter dinner! It had everything I look for in a trifle.

This was a yummy dessert. I had to make a couple changes, I didn't have strawberry whipped cream, so I used regular and it was still good. And I was confused in the recipe why it cuts the water in the jello in half. Next time, I'm going to make it like the box says and add the fruits like the recipe. I also used frozen mixed berries in the jello and fresh berries on top. Overall though very good, will def. make again!
