I lightened this recipe and it was still fabulously delicious. I will post the lightened version. OK now I will post it here because I still haven't successfully had a recipe I submitted be posted on this site. So here is the lightened ingredient list: 6 onions thinly sliced 1/4 cup light marg 1 (10.75 ounce) can 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup (vegetarian substitution for chicken) 3/4 cup 1% milk cup sherry (really flavor improvement!) 4 oz. shredded reduced fat jarlsberg cheese 4 slices french bread cubed For us it made 4 servings at 5 points per serving!

A great recipe to serve at a barbeque. I have made this several times but have added parmesan cheese to the cheese on top. My family loves parmesan. I will definitely keep this recipe around.

I thought this dish was very tasty. I did change a couple things. I used 2-1/2 sticks of butter NOT all 4. I also just coated one side of the bread with butter NOT both sides. The one side is touched by the cheese...and then the soup mixture. I do recommend either using 2% or whole milk when you add it to the soup. I used skim and it was a very thin sauce. Tasted great though...with all the other side dishes for Thanksgiving!!!!!! Definitely NOT a low fat dish....but delicious all the same!!! I might even add less milk to the soup mixture maybe 3/4 of a cup. It was fairly liquidy!!! ENJOY. Hope this helps!

Excellent taste and wonderful side dish for Thanksgiving. Even the people who normally didn't like onions really liked this. I only used 4 large onions and that was plenty. DELICIOUS!

This was just okay as-is. Because of the description I was expecting more of a French onion soup flavor but didn't really remind me of French onion soup at all. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe calls for WAY too much butter. I only used a total of two sticks of butter (one cup) for frying the onions and dipping the bread. Any more would have made the dish extremely soupy as it was already pretty juicy anyway. It is also impossible to cook six onions in a "small pan" as the directions state. I used my largest skillet (12-inch) and still had to cook them in two batches. Like another reviewer I cooked the onions much longer than 10-15 minutes...more like 20-25 minutes. I used a French baguette and we loved the fact that the crustiness of this bread allowed it to stay a little crunchy rather than getting soggy from the soup mixture. I did substitute Swiss cheese instead of the mozzarella as suggested thinking that would make it more like French onion soup. I also salted the onions a bit as they cooked to help draw out the juices. Even so the onions with the soup/milk mixture were still a little bit bland. This recipe definitely has potential so I'll try it again but I think I'll use cream of celery soup and beef consomme instead of the cream of chicken soup and milk to give it more of a French onion soup flavor. I also think I'll cut the baguette into croutons and toast them before using them to top the casserole.

I believe this is too much butter & I love butter! I've had this recipe by the title "Golden Baked Onions " a few years but mine only calls for 1 stick butter (1/2 C.) plus some extra melted to dip the bread slices on one side. Follow the recipe and then arrange bread buttered side up with other half down in the onion mix so that slices overlap. Excellent with 12 oz. Swiss or Gruyere shredded with some reserved for the top. Add the reserved cheese the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Yummy and easy too. My family loves this and it is very filling....Can use as the main course on a chilly evening. The only change I made was to sprinkle parmesean cheese on the bread before baking. Thanks so much.

This was almost too much of everything. I liked eating the bread but it was so rich my husband and I both felt a little sick after eating it. Would be ok as a side but not a main dish.

I thought this recipe looked good but I also was afraid it might be wierd and it was. Even though I seasoned it well and even added some beef boullion it was really bland soupy and not cohesive. I used good gruyere too so that was a bit disapointing. I'm going to chop up everthing and mix it with some beation eggs zucchini and more cheese and bake it like a crustless quiche. There's still hope in salvaging this recipe.

This was waaay better than I expected. My husband took one bite and made me taste it then exclaimed that this is what we're taking to family events from now on. I admit that I did mis-read the directions I had the onions on the bottom of the pan then the bread then poured the soup mix over top of the bread then put the cheese on top of the bread. All the ingredients flavors and cooking time were the same.

Nice recipe. I halved it and used 4 large onions and 1/2c butter whole milk and sour cream. The sour cream was a mistake on my part I added it accidentally but decided to keep it in. This was delicious with mashed potatoes and other sides of Christmas dinner but even better the next day when we used the leftovers in an omelette with our fave veggies cheeses and meats! Divine.

I'm going to have to agree with the person who said this was just too much of everything. I LOVE the idea and maybe 1 bite of the flavors is tremendously good--by the 2nd bite it's not. I used only 1.5 sticks of butter 2 onions homemade low-sugar French bread 8 oz soup 3/4c of milk & the full 2 cups of mozzarella. It was just too too rich. I think I will modify this and try again--I think I'll cook my onions butter my bread and put my cheese & onions on my buttered french bread & broil that!

I loved this! I cooked the onions longer than the recipe called for almost starting to carmelize. It had an addicting taste. Hubby didn't love it but I thought it rocked and am giving it five-stars anyway.

This was alot better than I thought it would be we did it with 3 onions and less butter and it still turned out great. I also mixed in a little swiss cheese. Next time I think I'll add a couple beef bullion cubes so it tastes just like french onion soup.

Really good! This is so rich and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. Its not over oniony like one might think. I served it as a side dish. This would be a great party food.

I just have to figure out where to start with this recipe...Taste was great...just too much of it...I think that in really small servings it would be good. Maybe even with croutons on top instead of the bread. The whole thing was strange but good all at the same time...I hope this helps but it has truly confused me.

This recipe was really scrumptious and oh so very rich! I just loved the taste of the crispy French bread on top of the onion mixture. So easy to make that I will make this recipe again probably around the holidays. Thanks for a wonderful treat!

We just were not sure about this! It tasted great but it was really weird to eat mouthfuls of 'soupy' onion! Bites with the bread were better but I won't make this again just because it was kind of strange.

I was hoping for more - I had a ton of onions to use up - and with all the butter and cheese (and calories) I would've preferred them just sauted. My kids ate it. My husband liked it but said it would've been more hearty with chicken in it. I wont go out of my way to make this again.

This was good but not fantastic. I didn't feel it had a lot of substance to it. I did reduce the amount of butter by half and substituted croutons for the bread to make it more casserole-like. The flavored were great but I guess if I make this again I will add potatoes or carrots to the onions.

Absolutely delicious. Made this for Thanksgiving and it has been requested I make it again Christmas.
