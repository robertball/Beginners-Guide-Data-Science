I made this exactly to the recipe and it needs to be modified.  Half the amount of vinegar and the rest water.  Double the persimons and double the sugar.  Spice was perfect with one medium sized anaheim pepper.  Mine came out way to acidic and with a vinegar taste even after it cooled.

I try one new Thanksgiving day menu item. This one was it. I'm happy to say that it was a hit. I  made it without the chili pepper since I knew I was serving some who weren't interested in too spicy. It was wonderful. I used a large spicy white onion and it had plenty of kick. Make it a couple of days in advance of whatever you're serving it for. It's best when it sits 48 hours.

Yikes!  Waaaaay too much vinegar for my taste!!  After simmering and realizing it wasn't going to tame out, I drained the liquid from the chunks, threw it out and added apple juice, the seasonings (again), and 3/4 cup sugar and simmered some more.  The fruit is still super pungent. I'm hoping it'll mellow out in the next 48 hrs before Thanksgiving! I'd hate to waste all those persimmons! If you're going to try the recipe, start with 1/2 the cider vinegar and go from there.  Also this recipe makes alot.

I was expecting more.....I think however, the persimmons I used were not ripe enough.  Their flavor was not detected.

I quadrupled this recipe so I could can it and give as holiday gifts. Glad the previous reviewers suggested using less vinegar; I used 1/2 of what was called for,  substituting other 1/2 for water. I used one large anaheim pepper, honey instead of sugar, and used both lemon & lime juice/zest. Delicious, can't wait to try with lamb chops! Also good if added to creamy base (i.e. butternut) and turned into soup.

Yumdeliciousness! I didn't have some of the ingredients and it still worked great as a basic recipe.  Reduced the amount of vinegar to about 3/4 cup as per previous reviewer's suggestion and it still tasted pretty acidic; I'd keep reducing it even further (the lemon juice also adds acidity!).  I didn't use raisins or chile peppers; instead, put in some cumin and Southwestern seasoning and powdered ginger (a key ingredient in many Indian chutneys).  It made the kitchen smell terrific and everyone loved the final product. We had it with steak and parmesan mashed potatoes.

Made it just as recommended but added a handful of pomegranate. I also added a couple dashes of my favorite Caribbean hot sauce since I didnâ€™t have the green peppers. 

Author did not specify the size of the persimmons and has no clue the variation in size. I chose 4 small fist size persimmons and the dish came out beautifully. Most people will be put off by the heavy vinegar smell when it is distilling down but do not reduce the amount. Just cook it as instructed and the final product will be absolutely delightful. 

I serve this as a small side with my chicken curry with coconut and bananas just as it is done in South Africa.

This is the first time I tried this recipe. Made a half batch and followed the proportions for the ingredients exactly as written. There is WAY TOO MUCH vinegar.  I will make it again-- but will use for a half batch -- about 1/3 c. and will balance out the remaining liquid with either apple juice or apple juice/water. As it cooled, it did get better,however, the prevailing taste was vinegar.  This is a very hearty chutney and would be good with duck or another game meat and should be served cold. With less vinegar, it might be OK at room temperature.
