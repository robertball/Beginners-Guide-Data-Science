These are a bit "cakey" for me - here is how I modified them to be PERFECT - and people at work obsess over them!  I put in only 3 eggs, then instead of 15 oz of pumpkin, I put in a 30 oz can of pumpkin pie mix (I use Libby's).  I then add an additional teaspoon of pumpkin pie seasoning to the flour mix, in addition to the cinnamon.  I've got my baking time down to 27 minutes in my oven, which is just the point where the toothpick comes out clean for the first time.  Then for the frosting, I add 8oz cream cheese, and double the rest of the frosting ingredients.  PERFECT!

Ready for a wow-factor twist on this?  I used previous suggestions to make this more of a bar-cookie consistency and added a bag of semi-sweet chocolate morsels at the last minute before popping into the oven.  Simply awesome.  I can see white chocolate chips, butterscotch, etc... let the sky be the limit.  OH, AND, I cut sugar down to 3/4 cup and oil down to 2/3 cup and we didn't miss it a bit... why add calories/fat when you don't really need it?  ENJOY THIS EASY AND YUMMY FALL RECIPE!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to try for a more bar-like result for today's picnic. I cut out one egg and ½'ed the baking powder and baking soda. I also added ½ tsp. of cloves and ½ tsp. of nutmeg. I thought they turned out great!! VERY moist, and exactly like I wanted. For the frosting, I used 8 oz of cream cheese and 3 cups of powdered sugar, which made about ½ cup more than I needed. A GREAT recipe!

I have made these atleast 5 times now and I can't get enough of them!  I don't have a jelly roll pan so i divide the batter between a 9x13 and an 8x8 pan to get the right thickness and they are always perfect.  although, i have forgotten to do that before and poured it all in a 9X13 and it just has to bake longer and is more cake-like.  this is easy and so yummy!!  make sure you try this one -- this is the one sure-thing i always want to bring to parties because everyone loves them!

HEAVENLY!!  These yummy bars make a great end to any meal.  I always seem to make changes to recipes, here is what I did different.  Added 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar. 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil.  Added about 1 1/2 teaspoon more of cinnamon, also added a little cloves, ginger, and allspice.  The frosting was the BEST, I did 6 oz of cream cheese instead of just 3 oz.  The extra spice really makes this recipe! Update, added full can of large pumpkin, one less egg, plus 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.  They were gone instantly!

I'm the one who posted this recipe, and I've gotten a lot of amusement from reading the reviews. The dollops of frosting are just from the picture, the instructions say to spread it for the people who think the little dollops aren't enough.  And the ones who think it's not cake enough, duh!  It says it's very moist.  And for those who claim I 'stole' the recipe from Paula Dean, check the dates.  This was posted over 15 years ago, long before Paula Dean was ever heard of on TV.  This recipe has been in my family since the early 70's, for all I know Paula got it here!

After reading some of the reviews, I used a 9x13 glass dish, and I changed the recipe by decreasing the eggs to 3, and I used a little less of the b.powder and b.soda to get a more dense (and very moist) result.  29 oz can of pumpkin with 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, and 1/2 tsp ground cloves gave it more flavor.  I only had whipped brown sugar/cinnamon flavored cream cheese to work with so I used that with a small amount of milk, butter and powdered sugar for the icing.

This was so good!  Everyone at our family gathering loved them.   I made the following changes, per the suggestion of other reviewers because I wanted more of a brownie texture: 3 eggs, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 29 oz. can pumpkin, half the baking powder and soda, and 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (instead of cinnamon)  The texture was very similar to a brownie and they were moist.  I'll be making this over and over again from now on.

Thie recipe was great! I used unsweetened Applesauce in place of the oil, and egg beaters in place of the eggs. I also added 1/4t nutmeg and 1/4 t ginger- it really was wonderful- moist and flavorful! Thanks!

Soooo yummy!  Next time I think I will make a little extra frosting.  I used a sugar pumpkin, cooked it and pureed it.  1 3/4 c. cooked pumpkin = 15oz. can.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these for a dinner party at my friend's place, and she only had a 9 X 13" pan.  I baked it for an additional 5 minutes and it came out very moist and delicious, a lot more like a cake than a bar.  I added more cream cheese and less butter for the frosting, which my friends loved.  Thank you so much.

These were a big hit at my house, even with my super picky 4 year old, and even without the frosting.  I took some other people's advice, and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, and I used Splenda instead of sugar.  Very easy and very tasty.

I took some other reviewer's advice and made some modifications. I cut the eggs down to 3 and used a large can (29oz) of pumpkin. I also used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the entire cup of oil. I also used brown sugar in place of half of the white sugar. I baked it in my pampered chef cookie sheet with sides for 27 min and it turned out absolutely perfect. Super moist and my family and friends couldn't get enough. For the frosting, I used the entire 8oz of cream cheese and doubled all the other ingredients. The perfect amount for the bars. I will definately be making these again.

Whoever came up with these, no matter who it is.....these are freaking awesome! I make them with butter instead of vegetable oil, organic pumpkin and two teaspoons of homemade pumpkin pie spice. To really take them over the top, I fold in one bag of Hershey's cinnamon chips.

Very Yummy!  I made two batches.  One was the regular recipe.  My son (7rs old) and I made them for his class 
Thanksgiving dinner.  To make it simpler we bought pre made frosting.  Then for my own family, who is on a reduced
fat diet for health reasons, I substituted the 1 c oil for 1 c sugarless applesauce and 4 eggs for 1c egg beaters.  Makes this a
fat free dessert and they are VERY moist and tastes wonderful.  Instead of frosting I took powdered sugar and added orangejuice
and poured it on the top.  Will make this often.  Easy, tastes great and best yet HEALTHY!

Absolutely perfect in texture, meaning super moist and soft. I added 1 tsp ginger, because its zing complements pumpkin goods so wonderfully, and because I was making it for a crowd that likes to feel its spice, I also added a couple good shakes of cayenne pepper, which added a comfortable (but perceptible) warmth. I wanted to add a little extra touch, but didn't want people to have to deal with the mess of frosting, since most just grab and go back to their offices. So I made a broiled caramel topping of 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 Tb cream and 1/3 cup finely chopped nuts (nuts may be omitted, and you can add 1/2 cup flaked coconut if you like it.) When I removed the bars from the oven, I spread it on top and broiled until the whole surface was bubbly. Cooled it on a rack. Not necessary to do by any means, as these bars can stand completely on their own, but it adds a little "something extra" and imparts a lovely sheen to the top, increasing eye appeal. Recipe freezes perfectly, and is great for serving a crowd. They're too good to make only during pumpkin season. 11/14 Edited to add: Made pumpkin streusel bars. Combined 5 Tb soft butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup flour in the food processor, pulsing until crumbly. Sprinkled on top of the batter in the pan and baked 28 min. The top finished with a pleasant crunch, lending counterpoint to the soft bars. I've also made with cooked mashed sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin. Every bit as good.

Wow, I love these! I took other reviewers recommendations - I did 1 less egg, halved the baking soda and baking powder and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. cloves and 1/4 tsp. ginger.  Baked in a jelly roll pan, it did have a bar like consistency and the flavor was great! Just used Duncan Hines' cream cheese frosting as I didn't have time to make my own, and it was excellent! Thanks!

I used 3/4 of a 29 oz. can and these bars still came out more cake like. I think next time I will try to add the whole can. They were not very flavorful like I am use to. I think by adding the pumpkin pie spice it may add more of a kick to the recipe. The cream cheese frosting gives it more flavor and was a great recipe.

These are actually Paula Deene's Pumpkin Bars taken directly from her show in 2009.  They are, in fact fabulous...moist, flavorful and downright yummy. I added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ground cloves and reduced the cinnamon from 2 tsp to 1 1/2 tsp. Increase the baking time to 40 minutes. Everyone loves them!

This recipe was delicious! I am watching my weight, so I made it lighter by using 1 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. Stayed just as moist and really cut the fat. I also used lowfat cream cheese for the frosting and left out the butter. It made the frosting a little runnier, but it set up okay. I also added a little orange zest to the frosting. Took these to a party and everyone loved them...no one missed the fat and calories!

I also used applesauce in place of the oil, and was pleased with the result. I would recommend serving these COLD, after adding the icing they firm up quite nicely. And of course, they taste wonderful!

This is a great way to add fiber to your diet and it's yummy too! I added a 1/2 tsp of ginger and a tsp of vanilla. I dusted the top with powdered sugar for kids lunches to keep the sugar level down. They loved it without the iceing but next time I will try the cream cheese topping. Thanks for the great recipe.

Everyone wants to know who Paul is...I'll tell you that he is the master of pumpkin bars!  Wonderful recipe, these are always a huge hit, not too sweet, just perfect.  Made the recipe as is and I had no problems whatsoever.  Thanks for sharing!

These were quite good, but I'm easy to please with pumpkin and spices!  I even added pumpkin pie spice to flavor the frosting!  It is moist, but I found it kinda cakey;  I think what I would do differently next time is make it as a two-layer cake: round, with a layer of cream cheese frosting in the middle, and all around the outside.

Absolutely delicious! Very moist, I used a 9X13 and cooked a little longer to make up for the thicker cake. I also stored in the fridge, its great cold.

These turned out pretty good.  My only complaint is that they were more like cake bars then actual "bars."  I didn't make the frosting as others suggested it made it a little too sweet so I made a simple homemade whip cream and it was perfect!

I took these bars to Nordstrom Family Night where my daughter works, they were devoured and employees were calling her the next morning to get the recipe from me and to please bring more when I visit again. Biggest hit ever on any dessert I have ever made!! Can't describe how delicious!! I decorated on top of icing with chopped walnuts and different holiday sprinkles.  AWESOME-thanks for helping me feel like a GEM!!!

Following the reviewers suggestion to use 3 eggs, and more pumpkin...did not work for me!  Don't do it, either follow the recipe or i wouldn't bother.

I had to make a "pumpkin" recipe for a party and found this little number. I have yet to write a review for a recipe but this was great!  It is now going to be a common occurance at my house. Everyone thought it was great and it stayed moist for days.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have a jelly roll pan so I used a 9x13 cake pan. It was just fine as a cake...probably better. Also, the frosting recipe is the best ever. I will use it for everything. Thanks!

These bars are very good. I could not get enough of them. I used 1 9x13 size pan and a 8x8 and had plenty of frosting for both. The only thing was that at the party I took them to everyone kept referirng to them as carrot cake! I admit it does taste a bit ( ok a lot!) like it and my husband says you really can't tell the difference, but I can. I think this recipe is better than carrot cake and without a doubt easier. I can't wait to make it again.

OMG these are good!  I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't think that these were too cake-like.  The frosting is delicious but you could enjoy these without the frosting too!  These went so quickly and everyone asked for the recipe.

This is DELICIOUS!!!! First off, the frosting is amazing (though I did use 8oz cream cheese). 
I did make minor changes: only 3 eggs, half white sugar, half brown sugar, fresh pumpkin puree, added 1/2 tsp clove and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and only 2/3c oil. Had to bake it for 35 min in a 9x13 glass dish in a gas oven.
Love, love, love it.

As some reviewers mentioned, this is really cake.  But it is delicious!  I love the frosting but you don't need it.  I also substituted 1/4 cup wheat germ for the flour to give it some fiber and put 3 tsp cinnamon instead of the 2.  Those were the only changes I made.

I just finished making these for our weekly potluck. They didn't last 10 minutes!  I did add a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, used 8 oz. of Neufchatel cheese  adding maple flavoring instead of vanilla. I also followed other readers advice and used brown sugar and white sugar as well. I used 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce in place of the one cup of oil. They were a hit! I will definitely be making them again!

Very moist and delicious pumpkin bars! They are the best when you let them sit for a day before eating. When we ate them after they cooled the pumpkin flavor tasted a little odd but the next day they were delicious! Would certainly make these again.

I made these for a friend's coworker who needed a party tray put together.  Of course I tasted these before I handed them over.  To me, this was a pumpkin cake rather than a bar.  Usually bars have some type of a "crust like" layer on the bottom...and this was just like a cake with icing.  I do like pumpkin, and so I did enjoy the taste.  For the icing, I mixed the cream cheese with some sugar and orange marmalade and had one lady tell me she loved it.  Personally , this was more cake-like than bar-like, but good nonetheless.

I don't have a jelly roll pan, but I decided to make these anyway. It took 40 min in a 13x9, and it turned out more like a cake. VERY good. A definate keeper in my house!

Everyone raved about these.  I followed directions for cake and used 9x13 cake pan.  Baked for 35 min.  Used 8 ounces of cream cheese and just under 2 cups powdered sugar.  Yum!

Wonderful bars. I took another person's advice and used half brown sugar and half white, 3 eggs rather than four, and coves, allspice, ginger and extra cinnamon. I also have an oven that likes to cook hot so they were done in 15 minutes. These are amazing. I'll be surprised if there are any left after this evening (and there's only 5 people in my house). Thanks!

I've made these pumpkin bars 5 or 6 times in the last 2 months. Every time I make them, more people request them!  The only change I made was to use 4 oz of cream cheese instead (as other reviewers mentioned). Everything else is perfect as is.    Great recipe Deb!

This recipe is the best out there.  It is the ONLY pumpkin bar recipe I use.  In fact I think I have it memorized I have made it so many times.  The bars are so moist and full of flavor.

I followed a lot of the suggested modifications from other reviews - doubled the amount of pumpkin, decreased the oil (2/3 cup) and sugar (3/4 cup), and added chopped pecans. I did use four medium eggs. I baked these in a 9x13-inch pan for about 35 minutes. I skipped the icing and just sprinkled powdered sugar over the tops. Very rich and dense, great pumpkin flavor, not too sweet. They were very moist - definitely did not need all of the oil listed in the original recipe. I will try them again with the cream cheese frosting.

These were a big hit.  I cut the oil in half and added a half cup of applesauce and YUM!  Very moist, didn't miss the extra fat.

I found this recipe on Food Network for Paula Deen. It's the same recipe except its supposed to be 8 oz of cream cheese not 3 oz. And she baked it at 350 for 30 minutes in a 9 x 13. I made them and they were absolutely delicious! I did use 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil to save some calories. Amazing!!

I made this and instead of 1 cup of oil, I used 1/2 cup oil, and 1/2 cup lite applesauce, I also used less butter than it called for in the frosting. It still turned out perfect, and less fat, loved it, will definately make again, thanks!

I made these for our homeschool party, and they were a huge hit!! I did make a few changes..For the bars: I used sugar in the raw, canola oil, unbleached flour, reduced eggs to 3, added pure vanilla, pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg. For the icing: I  followed other reviews by using 8 oz pkg cream cheese and doubling the rest of the ingredients. I wil certainly be making again! Thanks for sharing!

Made this exactly as written and it turned out very moist and flavorful.  Will likely use this recipe again - if I want pumpkin cake with cream cheese icing.  Because it really isn't bars, I'm giving this only 4 stars. But if you cook it in a jelly roll pan like the instructions say, it is thin enough to cut into "bars" and eat it with your fingers - which we did!

I have used this recipe several times and thought I finally needed to leave a review.  This is by far the best pumpkin bar recipe I have ever found.  I made exactly as stated and as is it deserves 5 stars.  ( I never understood how people can give 5 stars to a recipe they make changes to)  I am in the process of making a recipe book of the recipes I use most and this is definatley in it.

Very good!  I added chopped pecans to the top of my frosting.  Could also add to batter.

These are delicious! They were incredibly easy to make, and a total hit with my whole family. I chose not to ice them all at once though. I made up the icing, stuck it in the fridge, and allowed everyone to ice them on their own. That way, storing them was much easier.

Excellent Recipe- Very moist and adaptable; we added more allspice to get the true fall flavor of these pumpkiin bars, while mixing in some food color to make the cream cheese frosting more festive for Halloween. A note though- the bars really do not need frosting- you can eat them with tea or milk~for those with a more sensitive palette these are great right out of the oven-I saved some unfrosted and gave the kids the frosted ones. You will not be disappointed!

The reviews that say that this is more of a cake than bars are right. But the recipe was still very good -- I would definitely make again. The only change I made was to add 1/2 cloves and reduce salt by half. The icing was delicious!

I made these for Thanksgiving, as is and got rave reviews! I had some pumpkin left over, so I made a batch for my hubby to take to work. Welp, we're now in April and I've made them about 8 times for him to take to work as he gets requests for them constantly! Thank you for a great recipe that I'll continue making for years to come. :-)

I'm rating the recipe as is. These bars are delicious. The classic cakey pumpkin bars you've probably had at sometime in your life. I'm sure there are all kinds of ways to make them a completely different recipe that is good chips, spices, blah blah blah...that wouldn't be too hard to figure out, but these are good as is.

These were GREAT!!! I did modify because I have to living in CO with the high altitude (6,000 ft above sea level). Only used 3 eggs, cut the baking soda and powder in half, used 1 2/3 c sugar less 2 tbs., used 2 c flour plus 2 1/2 tbs. And per other reviewers added more spice... 2 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. cloves. and a splash of vanilla. I only baked for 15 mins. (exactly) in a 365 degree oven. Please note, batter is very thick, it had me worried for a minute. But, they came out moist and delicious in a 10 x 15 pan. I also did lightly grease with butter to ensure they didn't stick. Frosted with my favorite cream cheese frosting as the one listed would have been too buttery for my liking and voila!... simple, delicious pumpkin bars. All you people out there frustrated with altitude baking, here is your perfect pumpkin bar. Enjoy!!!

I followed the review of the previous person and was so disappointed, they were so moist that it  was like eating raw pumpkin pie. Not appealing to me at all. I don't know why people have to change every recipe, why is it not followed like written in the first place. The picture on the orginal recipe looks like a cooked bar, these were raw and I cooked 27 min like she said and did 3 more to 30 but to me it was nothing I would want to serve to anyone. I guess I learned my lesson, leave it like written.

I like the cake like consistency.  Moist and the cream cheese frosting is delicious.  My mother in law has been making these for years and all the kids loved them.  Now they are all grown, in college etc.. and specially ask her to make these for the holidays.  It's a great way to get them to eat pumpkin!!!!! ;

AMAZING! My favorite pumpkin recipe! I added chocolate chips. I did everything exactly as listed except I added a couple tablespoons less butter for the frosting. SO good, my mouth is water just thinking about them. I baked it in a glass baking dish, my hubby and I killed them all in a weekend.

Hearing that this is a cakey recipe, I decided to just put it into a single rectangular cake pan.

It was incredible! Everyone loved it and it got devoured quickly. Thank you!

i have a couple things to say about these. i made exactly as written.

a: not a bar! they are cake all the way.

b: they are delicious none the less. i made a topping of whip cream, cream cheese and powdered sugar (i didn't want to use butter).

i will probably make this again and save it in my recipe folder.. but as a cake. my search will continue for the perfect pumpkin bar. :)

I made a healthier version of these bars and they are still so yummy.  Instead of using vegetable oil I used apple sauce, and  I replaced the 4 eggs with egg whites.  I also added a tablespoon of pumpkin spice.  These are so yummy and I feel a little less guilty because I made a healthier version.

These were a hit! Based on advice of other reviewers, the only change I made was I used Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix instead of pumpkin puree for more flavor and to make these moist. These were delicious!

I have been making this recipe for over 10 years. The only difference between this one and mine is my recipe uses 2 cups of sugar and I add 1/4 tsp ground cloves and and 1/2 tsp of fresh ground nutmeg along with the cinnamon. Last but not least I always double the cream cheese frosting... c'mon who doesn't love their pumpkin bar slathered in good cream cheese frosting?!? I also use good Mexican vanilla in my frosting... This is what heaven would taste like in the fall...

These are sensational!  Moist and spongy, they are the best pumpkin bars I've ever made.  I added 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (in addition to the cinnamon).  For the frosting I increased the cream cheese to 4 oz. and decreased the butter to 6 Tbsp.  I don't have a 10x15 jelly roll pan, so I baked them in 13x9 and 8x8-inch pans.  It worked out great - hubby took the big one to share at work and we kept the small one at home.  I thought there wasn't quite enough frosting, so next time I will increase it by half again as much.

Fabulous, just fabulous. I've also made these more healthy. I cut it down to 1 cup of sugar, substituted half of the oil with the same amount of applesauce, and replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour. They are still absolutely fabulous!

Yum!  Very moist.  I followed other bakers' suggestions and here are the changes I made.  I doubled the pumpkin to 30oz, I added 1tsp of pumpkin spice, kept the baking powder and soda the same and reduced the oil to about 2/3 cup.  I could probably have reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and still have it be very moist because of the extra pumpkin.  I doubled the frosting recipe.

Fantastic:) I did change a few things. I used only 1.5 tsp cinn, then added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 tsp groung clove. This recipe is the best of it's kind, hands down. The secret is DON'T OVER BAKE. Yummmmmy !!!

Very moist and delicious!  I followed previous reviews and used 3 eggs and 30 oz pumpkin pie mix and also used 8 oz cream cheese for the frosting.  The bars were full of flavor.

My husband & I thought this recipe was delicious.  The taste was wonderful even without the frosting.  We liked the 'cake' texture of this recipe.  I used fresh pumpkin pie filling, only 3 eggs, 1/4 cup of applesauce substituted for some of the oil, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour the rest unbleached white flour, 1  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, & 1 tsp vanilla.

Great recipe!  The bars are more like a cake, but most pumpkin bar recipes I have seen are more cakey.  The two changes I made was adding a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and frosted the bars with cream cheese frosting II.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for tailgating today and it was a huge hit!!!  It was really good.  
Instead of 1 cup of oil... I substituted 1 cup of applesauce.  So very moist and yummy!  
I cut the sugar a little bit, cant remember how much... 
I also did add nutmeg, cloves, and ginger as well - to me pumpkin just screams 'spices!'  
I also used a 10x15 jelly roll pan.  
I did tweak the icing a bit to make it less sweet - this topped just enough, I don't like a lot of icing on top.  I used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar, 4oz of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I don't eat a lot of sweets and it was just perfect!!!  
I will cut down eggs to 3 next time, may be why the below raters think it is too cakey?  
Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!! :)

Excellent and just what I was looking for.  I wanted more "bar" than "cake" so I followed the suggestions to reduce the eggs to 3 and to cut the baking powder and soda by half.  I also added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Also adjusted the frosting by using 8 oz cream cheese and extra 10x sugar.

Came out as more of a cake, but still delicious!  I didn't use a cup of oil (I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce).  I also added pumpkin pie spice and kept the cinnamon as was called for in the recipe.  The frosting was a little too sweet for my taste, but overall, the recipe deserves an A+.

All I can say is YUM!!! My husband and I ate way too many of these, they were so good. I used a combination of cinnamon and Pumpkin Pie spice instead of just cinnamon. For the frosting, I had made some with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site, and I used that instead. They were great. Thank you!

I have made this twice now and my whole family loves it.  I make it in a sheet cake pan, because I don't have the right size jelly roll pan, and it makes a very moist cake rather than a bar. I top with cream cheese frosting and Halloween sprinkles and have served it for the last two years at Halloween. It's great!

Good either as sheet cake or 9x13.  The butter in the frosting should be decreased however.  I used 2 Tablespoons instead of 1/2 cup.

These bars are so delicious.  Everyone at work loved them.  I used cream cheese frosting instead of making my own which made the whole process a little quicker.  I will definitely make these again.

The flavor of these is amazing. Per another reviewer I reduced sugar to just one cup and only used ½ cup of applesauce + ½ cup oil.  Tasted fabulous.  The only issue was baking time.  I used a smaller pan (9x11) and baked for 30 minutes. Toothpick in center came out clean but when they cooled the center was mushy.  I solved by microwaving a cut piece (even frosted!) for about 90 seconds.  Yum!  Just wish I'd baked longer in the first place.

This pumpkin cake was rather bland and I couldn't really taste the pumpkin. I would not recommend. However, I will definitely keep the icing recipe. The icing was fantastic.

I also added more pumpkin, cut down on the oil and sugar and these bars are very moist and flavorful! I also added about 1 cup of cinnamon chips  to the batter as well as pumpkin spice seasoning.  I didn't have 8 oz. of cream cheese so I added about 2oz. of pumpkin cream cheese and the frosting was delicious. great time of year for these bars! Thank you Deb for sharing!

As other reviewers suggested, I decreased to one egg, decreased baking soda and baking powder a bit, added pumpkin pie spices.  I baked in a 9 x 13 pan and reduced baking time to 27 minutes.  So good!

Not bad, could use some more spices.  I liked that these were bars and not cake.  I used 1 less egg, half applesauce/half oil, and added mini chocolate chips.  No need for frosting!

These are delicious! I didnt bake mine in a jelly roll pan, just in a 9x13 inch pan and they came out awesome.  This doesnt scream "bar" to me, more like a dense delicious cake! I love pumpkin spices, so insteade of just the cinnamon I added a 1 1/2 tbsp of pumpkin spice and a pinch of ground clove. Sounds like a lot I know, but it was soo worth it!  The cream cheese frosting was great as well.  This recipe is a keeper.

This turned out amazing! I left it in the oven for a bit longer than recommended, using a toothpick to test the centre as when checking the done-ness of pumpkin pie. So quick 'n' easy, & after icing it, it quickly disappeared! Everyone loved it! Now it's a huge request for Christmas!

I made these for the first time last week for our church pie fellowship, they were a huge hit and there wasn't one left :) I followed the changes made by circekitty. except, I made the pumpkin puree myself with a real pumpkin and I only added 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of the 4 she recommended. Also, I was a little short on the puree, my pumpkin produced 21 ounces but hey, it still turned out great! I just finished making these bars again for the second time for our family thanksgiving tomorrow. I will know how the family likes them then ;) I will definitely make these again and again. Very easy to make... and super delish!!!

I made these for a Thanksgiving dessert and they turned out great.  After reading some of the reviews, I used 3 eggs and added 1 tsp. of pumpkin spice.  I didn't have a jelly roll pan so I used a 9"x11" cake pan and it worked out fine.  It looks more like a cake but it was still good.  Very moist.  Will make this recipe again for sure.

These are super easy and very tasty. Though I was looking for more of a "bar" recipe, this one is more cake-like.  I followed advice of some others and cut the baking powder and soda in half, and used only 3 eggs, but still was a bit cakey.... although delicious nonetheless.

I baked in a 10x15x1 and cut into bars and pulled out of then pan, before actually frosting. Frosted each separately with a dollop and then put a pecan on top.  Cute and yummy. :)

Oh my gosh, these are SO good!  I just pulled them out of the oven and I can't stop eating them!!  Hopefully there will still be some left when they cool so I can try the frosting.  I altered a bit based on other reviews.  I only used 3 eggs, I put in 1C white sugar, 1/2C brown sugar, used only 1t baking powder, and I used 1t cinnamon and 1t pumpkin pie spice.  I will definitely be making these again very soon!!

This recipe was ok. I as suggested by others reduced the B.P and B.S., and also only added 3 eggs. I also added a tsp. of nutmeg. Wish I would have added more nutmeg. It was very moist, but did not have much flavor. Don't know if I'd make this recipe again.......

Awesome easy recipe. I make it with whole wheat flour and substitute all the oil with apple sauce. This makes a healthier choice that taste great. I have made it into muffins and it turns out great! My husband loves them!

OMG these turned out SO good! In hopes of making them more brownie-like, I only used 3 eggs and 1 teaspoon of baking powder. To help with the flavor, I used half white sugar and half brown (decreased it slightly to 1 1/2 cups) and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. These are phenomenal. They're so moist and delicious. Oh, and the cream cheese frosting was perfect - don't mess with success! Make these now. Seriously.

These were really delicious.  I took other reviewers suggestions and changed some things.  I used a 29 oz. can of pure pumpkin, 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 3 eggs instead of 4, I halved the baking powder and baking soda, and I also cut back on the sugar to 1-1/3 cup.  I also added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Even though I really changed the recipe, the basic ingredients are the same.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 35 minutes.  They turned out moist and bar-like.  The only thing I did different for the cream cheese frosting was using 4 ounces instead of 3.  It was so delicious!  Probably the best cream cheese icing I've ever tasted!  I would have given this recipe 5 stars but since I changed so many things it made it slightly different.

Turned out awesome.  I altered a few things--whole wheat flour, little flax seed, little less sugar.  I will make this more often.

yummy bars or cake... whatever you want to call it!  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and reduced the baking soda and powder by a little bit each.  Even though I am sure the frosting is delicious, we have a dairy allergy- so I made a vanilla cinnamon glaze to go on top.

Just got them out of the oven and they are great! I made a healthy version that still tastes wonderful. Used whole wheat flour, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup oil, 30 ounces fresh pumpkin, 1 1/3 c sugar and added pumpkin pie seasoning as well.

I stayed true to the recipe for the most part except for subbing 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice for one of the tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I agree with fellow raters who say these have a cake like consistency, they do for sure and are very moist. I thought these were fantastic. I baked them in a 10x15 and they came out great! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

These were great.  I made them (minus the froting) for my preschooler's snack day (when we provide snack for all of the children in the class) and used 2 cups of pumpkin that I had pureed and frozen this fall.  He told me he wasn't going to like them, but I asked him to try it, and when he came out of school, he said "mom, I liked the pumpkin bars, they did not have any pumpkin in them!"  They smelled heavenly and the teachers told me that they kept the extras and ate them (they usually send the extras back home) because they were so delicious.  I love how light and fluffy they are.  I'll bet they are incredible with the icing.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.  Thank you!

Amazing.  Took the first reviewer's advice and doubled the pumpkin and reduced the eggs; I used brown sugar instead of white; and I used fresh sugar pumpkin (halved and roasted in the oven for 1 hr then mashed) and the result was wonderful!

I was looking for a recipe for pumpkin BARS, and this being the top rated one, I went with it. Followed it, with the exception of adding additional pumpkin pie spice, and came out with a very moist (but oily) pumpkin CAKE. Yes, the recipe was tasty, but these are not bars. It was not what I was looking for. However, I will save this (and probably substitute some applesauce) for the next time I want to make pumpkin cake or cupcakes.

These are great. I have made them with full baking soda and with half, with full it turns out like muffiny and with half more like pumpkin pie. Wonderful either way. This is my go to pumpkin bar recipe.

A little more like cake than bars, but I absolutely loved them! The second time I made it I added chocolate chips and even my husband (who swears he doesn't like the taste of pumpkin) managed to eat a bunch!

Amazing!  We used 30 oz pumpkin pie mix in placed of the puree and added in White Chocolate Chips.  I also used a full package of Cream Cheese for the frosting.  Made them about an hour and a half before a dinner party and go rave review!

Made these yesterday for a party at our house. Outstanding as written. Didn't change a thing, only added walnuts to the batter. The frosting is perfect as written. Thank you Deb! Everyone wanted this recipe.

I followed the recipe except added only 3 eggs, 30 oz can of Libby's pumpkin pie mix and an extra teaspoon of pumpkin pie seasoning for the bars. For the frosting, I used an 8 oz. package of cream cheese, 1/2 a cup butter, 2 tsp. vanilla and about 2-2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Everyone at work loved them, and they were very moist, yet fluffy.

Made these as is. Baked in what's called a half sheet pan (I think it's 18x13) because I didn't have the 10x15 it calls for. This way they are thinner and more like bars. Only problem was I had to double the frosting recipe to cover the whole pan. But these are great AS IS. Don't know why people have to severely change the recipe! Yummy!

I've made this 3 times this week. First time, I followed it exactly, and it did come out more like a cake. 2nd time I used 3/4 can of unsweetended applesauce in place of oil, didn't make a huge difference in terms of texture. 3rd time I used only 3 eggs, 3/4 can of unswtnd applesauce in place of oil, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder. It came out fantastic! (I think when people think of bars, they expect a cookie bar, which is not what you will get. However using the modifications of my 3rd try, it came out like a very dense bread...held together firmly enough to be called a bar in my opinion.) I also add Nutmeg and Ginger to the pumpkin mixture. I just keep tasting the batter and adding them til I get the flavor I enjoy. For another tip, I use a 12x16 cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper. Done in 27 minutes for me. Once it has cooled, but still a little warm, I lift both ends of the paper, flip it over onto the sheet, peel the paper off in one piece, then flip it over again onto my sheet. (If you let it cool completely, the paper will not come off all at once.) Now the icing, it has not turned out at all. It's more like a glaze that never sets, which makes them incredibly messy to eat. I've even tried putting them in the fridge for a few hours, and the "icing" just drips off when you pick one up. No one else has complained about the icing, so it must be me. (I tried using the recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting too and had the same problem. I added 1/2 container o

I was looking for a pumpkin cupcake recipe and decided to try this recipe.I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe. I agree with the other review that this a cakey recipe rather than a bar, which was perfect for cupcakes! I added 1 tsp ground nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Half the cupcakes, I placed the frosting on top and the other half, filled the middle with the frosting! Yummy!

I was making treats for work and thought these would be a good fall treat, especially after reading some of the reviews.  I followed some of the tips and did the half oil/applesauce split, half white and brown sugar and twice the pumpkin pie filling.  I'm glad I tried them before bringing them to work.  They were disgusting. I will definately not make these again. It is really hard to gauge a recipe when people rate it 5 stars after changing half the ingredients.

Eventhough this recipe is more like a cake, it is a fentastacily delicious recipe. Because almost no one in Japan has an oven, I made these in my tiny toaster oven in muffin tins. They became Paul's Pumpkin Cupcakes and they were AMAZING!!!

Mmmmm...I love pumpkin bars!  I greased and floured my pan and chose a different frosting recipe, I like more cream cheese and more sugar.  I wish I would've added some vanilla to the batter though.

Delicious! Baked in a 9x13 and an 8x8 to make it more bar like. Used only 3 eggs, halved the baking powder and baking soda. Added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to flour mixture. Done in 23 minutes.

Thankfully, I read the reviews prior to making this, so I changed the recipe to make more moist, dense bars. I used (2) 15 oz. cans of packed pumpkin, half the amount of baking soda and baking powder, and added 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. So far, everyone LOVES them. My neighbors are practically drooling over them. Lol.

Yum!!!  As others suggested, I added about 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.  Unfortunately I didn't have any cloves or I would have added some.

Cake like texture and the icing is really good.  I doubled the icing recipe as others suggested.  I used 8 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 4 cups of powdered sugar.

These were really good.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  this will definitely be a seasonal favorite in our home.  I followed the suggestion of reducing the oil and sugar by 1/3 each and didn't miss it at all.  To get the taste of cream cheese frosting without the fat I used a 2 tbsp. reduced fat cream cheese, 1 tsp. vanilla and a small container of fat free cool whip blended.  Excellent!!!  Just for a new spin i may serve warm with a scoop of lowfat cinnamon ice cream next time.

Too cakey and not NEARLY enough spice.  I even added a couple dashes of cloves, allspice and nutmeg and it was still really plain.  Sorry, I know I'm in the minority here, but this isn't the pumpkin bar recipe I'll return to.

EXCELLENT BARS!!! I ADDED A LITTLE FRESH NUTMEG & GINGER, AND HAD TO USE A COUPLE ROUND PANS, INSTEAD OF THE JELLY ROLL PAN.  THEY LOOKED AND TASTED GREAT! AFTER I FROSTED THEM, I MADE SOME LITTLE ORANGE PUMPKINS W/ GREEN STEMS ON EACH SERVING & CUT THEM INTO TRIANGLES. THIS ONE'S A KEEPER. :)

This was a HUGE hit at a family dinner last night. The only changes I made was 2 tsp of pumkin pie spice instead of the cinnamin, a little more sugar to the frosting because it wasn't thick enough for me and I used a 9x13 pan. If you have time after you frost it, place the cake in the fridge for a couple of hours. That sets the frosting beautifully and makes the cake yummy and cool! I have renamed this Pumpkin Spice Cake since it really isn't a "bar" recipe. Thanks!!

This made a moist pumpkin cake. (I used a 9X13 pan.)I added some pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon. Frosting-I used an 8 oz. cream cheese instead of 3oz. 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar instead of 2 cups. Yummy! I will make this again.

These cakelike pumpkin bars were very easy to make and simply delicious to eat.  I did follow the recipe exactly except for substituting  McCormick pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon.  Took them to a church function and received rave reviews from all.  Will certainly make again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Just for the record - I HATE pumpkin! But my family loves it and this fall weather inspires me to make some season-appropriate treats. To my utmost surprise, I liked these, although I couldn't eat more than 1 in a sitting...did I mention I HATE pumpkin? Well, then that says alot for this recipe! I did reduce the cinnamon by half but added a tsp of vanilla. Thanks Deb for the great recipe that ALMOST converted me.  PS - my family thinks they're fabulous!

I poured the batter into 2 - 8 in. round pans. I baked it for approx. 40 mins. It came out just like a cake. VERY MOIST & DELICIOUS.
I used Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin. I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II on allrecipes.com. The whole family loved it.

Made a few adjustments: only 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup softened butter instead of oil (butter is always better), and a dash of allspice. Absolute heaven! The cake itself is like a pillow that melts on your tongue and the icing is so delicious. These are not like typical bar cookies, more like a thin sheet cake of pumpkin bliss. Either way, you cut into squares and then proceed to eat about 10 of them.

I didn't want cake-like pumpkin bars so I made the following changes based on previous reviews:

3 eggs, 3/4 white sugar, 3/4 light brown sugar, 1 cup applesauce, 30 oz can Libby's pumpkin pie puree, 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 3 tsps cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp salt.

8 oz cream cheese package, 1/2 stick butter, powdered sugar, vanilla.

Poured in 9X13 metal cake pan and baked for 31 mins at 350.

Worked like a dream -- the bars held up nicely and I kept them in the freezer to cool before adding the frosting. This recipe was very simple and I think the changes really hit the spot for those who want more of a "bar" than a cake.

These were great.  I know it's a bit annoying, but after reading the reviews I adjusted as well.   This what I did:  I decreased the eggs to 3, added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and upped the pumpkin to 30oz.  I also had to change the frosting recipe because I didn't have confectioners sugar.  I did 8oz cream cheese, 1 stick of real butter, 1 tsp of REAL vanilla (2 tsp of extract) 3 cups of powdered sugar.

I know a lot of people made changes, but we thought this was great as-is.  It's more of the way dessert was intended to be at it's inception:  A reasonably sized, sweet treat. Not enough size for a meal in and of itself!  Having said that, I think this would work very well for a jelly-roll style cake, using the same icing in the recipe.

I absolutely loved these pumpkin bars!  I was so sad because I couldn't find the receipt my mom had given me and I was so upset because it was one of her staples and since she is passed on I couldn't get it anywhere.  So when I came across this recipe, I couldn't believe how much it reminded of my mom's recipe!  I just loved it!  I did, however, add a little bit of nutmeg, but that's all I did.  I may make them again for Christmas!

This is a very adjustable recipe. We have to eat gluten free and this worked well. I made half the amount stated and reduced the sugar by a quarter cup, instead of oil I used one cup (the plastic cup they are sold in) of applesauce and just a little oil, instead of flour I used one cup of gluten free bisquick. I baked it in a large glass pan (about 9*13) and after 40 min of 375 I increased to 400 and kept my eye on it. It turned out very moist and I was told not to bother freezing the left overs. Whole family loved it.

Perfect for a Fall dessert or snack.  RAVE reviews by all eaters.  I made mine in a 16x11 jelly roll pan.  Yes they are a little more like a cake than a brownie/bar texture, but are really great with coffee.  The icing is also easy and very delicious.  I have made these 3x in recent weeks.  I think I will try adding coconut, crushed pine apple, and walnuts next time around to see if I can duplicate a Hummingbird cake.

Like other reviewers, I only used 3 eggs, but I wish I had cut down on the baking powder and soda as well, and I also wish I had used the pumpkin pie spice rather than just cinnamon in the batter.  I used a jelly roll pan, like the recipe said, but it seemed even too much batter for that, so I used an 8x8 in addition to the jelly roll.  I tried making these low-gluten, so they rose a little funky, because I used half of the flour and the other half rice flour, but they tasted fine.  The grittiness of the rice flour is the only thing that kept this from being great.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the amount it made and not fitting into the jelly roll. I do think it would have been like a cake had I tried to put all the batter in one pan.  I also would double the frosting next time I make these.  But it's a really easy and nice fall recipe!

Very good recipe. However, next time around I'm going to add the 1tsp of pumpkin  spice as the video mentioned. I think it will deepen the flavor a bit more.

Did as another post suggested and omitted one egg, dropped the baking soda and baking powder to 1/2 teaspoons each and then added 1/2 teaspoon of both ginger and cloves.  Used a 10x15 jelly roll pan and they rose to just over an inch thick at the middle which is perfect. Added a bit extra cream cheese (probably 4 oz is what I had wrapped up so I just used it all and added a bit more icing sugar to thicken up the icing)  The kids would have eaten half the pan after school if I had let them!

I read the other reviews and decided an extra can of pumpkin and more cinnamon and spice was needed.  2 Cans of pumpkin, 1 T cinnamon, 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice and 1/3 cup less of sugar.  I think even less sugar (about 1 cup) would be fine.

I made these as gifts to give at a Christmas Party we went to tonight.  These are moist and soooo good!  I followed the cake part of the recipe exactly and used 8" disposable foil pans - I got 4 pans per recipe.  For the frosting, I followed another cream cheese frosting recipe that was super yummy - I got it from a magazine and altered it to my taste.  I will be using this recipe from now on as my "go to" recipe for Pumpkin Bars - it just doesn't get any easier than this!!!

Good recipe.  I added a bit of ginger, and a hint of nutmeg as well as the cinnamon.  Used 4 eggs, and got a great flat cake that was suitable for "stacking."  I used a jellyroll pan as written, but greased it before pouring the batter in.  After baking, I turned the cake out.  When it was cooled, I cut it in thirds and made a three-level layer cake that my guests loved.  It was beautiful, first of all, and they gobbled it up, so it proved to be delicious.  Nothing was left.  The icing:  I used 8 oz of cream cheese, so it had that tangy "cream cheese" flavor to it.  Otherwise did the icing as listed.  Also had to double the recipe for the stacking.  You want a nice amount of icing when doing that for the visual effect.  Wish I had taken a picture.  I only iced the tops of the pieces, so we could easily see the layers of pumpkin bar with the creamy icing.

Thee best pumpkin bars I have ever had! I even converted my nana from her tried and true recipe.  I did use pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon and half the oil and repaced it with unsweetened applesauce. Thanks

These were delicious!!! I did a few tweaks to the recipe. I took the advice of others and only did 3 eggs and 1/2 the amount of baking soda and baking powder to make these less cake-like. I also added a package of Pumpkin Spice Jell-O. I do this to pretty much every bar/cake. It makes it even more moist and adds a little more flavor. I also added a few shakes of Nutmeg. And YUM!!! My husband and son just LOVE these bars. I'm sure I'll be making them again and again.

I substituted natural applesauce for all of the oil.  I also reduced the eggs to 3.  Used 4 oz of cream cheese in the frosting and added some cinnamon while mixing.  Yum!

These were so great the first time I made them exactly following the recipe, and even greater when I combined the recipe with a crumble topping (any crumble recipe you like should work) instead of making the frosting.  This is now my go-to thing to bring to holiday family events, and everyone loves them!
I do sometimes reduce the sugar when I make them just to have at home, they're great either way!

I didn't read far enough in the reviews to incorporate all the changes. I did add 30oz Libby pumpkin puree, 3 eggs instead 4. Added 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to the cake.  For icing: 8 oz cream cheese and doubled everything else.  

I should have halved the baking soda and powder and put a lot more spices in!  The bars were very moist with a great texture but BLAND...no flavor except the icing, I couldn't really even taste the pumpkin although they were a bit better the next day after chilling in the refrigerator over night. As far as icing:  I think doubling the butter was too much.  IF I bake again I'll do the 8oz cream cheese but 1 stick of butter and 3 cups confectioners sugar.

These were amazing - couldn't keep myself away from them!  I cut the oil in half and used applesauce to make up the difference, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Each and every one of my family members jumped up and grabbed a plate when I asked who all wanted to take some home :)

This is really yummy & so is the frosting.  These are super moist & can definitely skip the frosting if you want! I took advice from others since I wanted to have more of a 'brownie' than cake.  So I used only 3 eggs, natural applesauce in place of the oil, 30oz canned pumpkin, cut the baking powder & soda in 1/2 of what is shown on original recipe & added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice, 1 tsp of allspice & 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Other revisions I made was due to personal preference, I try to stay away from 'white' sugar & flour so in place of the white sugar I used 3/4 cup Sucanat & 3/4 cup Erythitol (reduced 'sugar' to 1.5 cup). For the 'white' flower I used almond flour.  Now this was very, very, very moist! I cooked for an hour (because it just seemed to not be getting done inside) & let sit to cool. Slice up into squares, went to have a piece but the inside was still almost 'pudding' like. So placed the sliced up bars still in the 9x13 pan back in the over for another 30 min.!  It seemed to get done inside more (maybe because it was sliced) but was still really, really moist.  I would say the inside of mine was like the consistency of bread pudding and the top more like a brownie's.  
For the frosting bumped up cream cheese to 8oz, doubled butter, vanilla and used only 3cup conf. sugar.  Next time I'll try only 1 can pumpkin in cake, maybe won't be so 'super' moist & only 1cup butter & 2.5 cup conf. sugar in frosting to cut calories.

I make these all the time for the past year since i found this wonderful dessert!  People still ask for the recipe!  I am going to start making this every thanksgiving.  

The only thing i do is double the icing and use libbys pumpkin puree...I have used a generic brand and it didn't taste as moist!

I wanted a bar that was so thick it looked like pie. Following the other reviews I ended up with just that! They didn't even need the frosting, but they sure do taste good with it! Later when the frosting is gone, but you still have a few bars left in the fridge, they make a great snack!

I made this once to try it out and again for a church Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a hit!  I did substitute half of the oil with applesauce.  I don't have a jelly roll pan, so to get the right height (the first time it looked like cake) I used a 9X12 and an 8X8 casserole pan.  I plan to take this to my in-law's for our Thanksgiving!

I followed the original recipe without any modifications and it turned out perfect.  It tastes more like a moist cake than a traditional bar, but delicious nonetheless.  I'd reccomend this recipe to my friends/family!

Doubled recipe and made the following changes:
3 cups of fresh pumpkin puree (instead of 2 cans)
1 cup of sunflower oil & 1 cup of butter (instead of 2 cups of veg. oil)
Lots of cinnamon, a good amount of cloves, and a little ginger.
We didn't add frosting, but the pumpkin bars are delicious!!!  They held together well after being cut.  My kids asked for more and more!

For the bars, I followed the top review(CIRCEKITTY) to the letter and they were FANTASTIC.  The frosting, however, is waaaay too sweet (for me).  I kicked the cream cheese up to 8 ounces and HALVED the other ingredients.

Very moist and fluffy pumpkin cake with the best creamy cream cheese frosting. I added a little water to the frosting to make it easier to spread on the cake. I would definitely make again.

These were INCREDIBLE! I think I may like these more than traditional pumpkin pie. The cake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was heavenly! Like a lot of other reviewers, I made a few changes to the recipe. I used 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and added 1 teaspoon of both nutmeg and cloves. Baked for 27 min. in a 9x13 pan. For the frosting, I used one 8 oz. package of cream cheese and 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar--everything else I left the same. If you like pumpkin pie, you need to try this recipe!!

Great recipe, but more like a light cake than a bar.  We tweaked it to half vanilla, half maple to add a kick to the flavor.  It was gone in less than 24 hours.

Great recipe!  I followed the recommendation to reduce to 3 eggs, half the baking soda and powder, and add nutmeg and clove.  We had to bake these a bit longer.  For the icing, I used 8 ounces of cream cheese, 3 ounces of powdered sugar, and a bit of milk to make it of spreadable consistency.  These were delicious! I will definitely make these again.

I made my bars in a 9x13 pan, and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  For the frosting, since I was out of vanilla extract and it was too late for a run to the store, I subbed almond extract.  These were so delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The only reason this didnt get 5 star was because I didnt think it had enough pumpkin or cinnamon taste. Super moist cake though. Will make again but will add more cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. Also, thought it made way too much icing and the sweetness of the icing may have been why I didnt think it had enough of a pumpkin taste. Will cut the icing recipe in half next time also. Otherwise, a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I increased the cream cheese in the frosting to 8 oz. which made the frosting absolutely delicious.  Unfortunatly, I felt like the "bars" were really lacking something.  They were definitely more cake like than bar like.  The pumpkin flavor just did not shine thru like I was hoping.  I would recommend adding more spices- they need cloves, ginger, and nutmeg for sure.

Excellent! I'd say it's somewhere between a "cake" and a "bar" Will be making these again. I did use a different recipe for the cream cheese frosting, but it was very similar to this one.

I also went with all the reviews and added the extra pumpkin as CIRCEKITTY suggested, as I like a more dense bar. I also doubled the frosting recipe and frosted the bars rather than a dollop. It was a little too much frosting, and tasted strongly of butter. I will look for a different recipe for the frosting next time, or just half the butter. Thanks for the recipe and suggestions. Edit/Update Finally found a frosting recipe that I LOVE:  3 ounces cream cheese - soften
                 3/4 stick of butter soften
                  1 3/4 cup powdered sugar
                  1 tsp. vanilla flavoring
                  1 TBLS. milk
I usually double it since I love frosting :)

This reminds me of a pumpkin dot cake I've made for years. The recipe calls for All Bran cereal!  I've made these twice in 2 days and shared many with family and friends! They all LOVED these and asked for the recipe. I added approx. 1 1/4 c semi sweet morsel, 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and omitted the frosting. A keeper and a hit!! I'd give these TEN stars if I could! YUMMY!!

I made MINOR substitutions, just to make them healthier. I substituted applesauce for the oil, 3 egg whites and one egg yolk, and wheat flour for the white flour. Finally, substituted fat free cream cheese for regular cream cheese.  I received RAVE reviews from my co-workers and to sum them up, simply AMAZING!!! Thanks for sharing!!

I have made these today for the second time now and they are one of my fave bars ever! my kids love them and they never last more than a couple days around here! the batch is big enough to take to a pot luck or church function which makes it easy on me too!  I made some changes but only slightly to make them more solid and less cake like as other reviewers suggested!  I only used three eggs, 1 cup of sugar plus a little, i used shortening instead of veg oil because i ran out, i cut the baking powder and soda in half and added one tblsp of cinnamon, one of apple pie spice, or a little nutmeg, allspice and ginger. i also added a full 30 ounce can of libbys pumpkin  I have made it before i had a jelly roll size pan and it worked great in two 9 by 13s!   I made homemade crm chs frosting a little different, i always do. I had one package of crm ch, three tblsps butter, a fourth cup of shortening, one cup of pow sugar and about three tblsp of libbys pumpkin pie filling, just what i scraped out of the can after I had added it to the batter. it has just a hint of pumpkin and i sprinkled nutmeg, alspice and cinnamon on top of the slightly orange tinted frosting! SUCH A WINNER! wish i had more stars! OH and i added about a cup and a 1/2 of ghiradeli chocolate chunks this time which took them OVER the top! i was gonna use raisens but hubby does'nt like them and i knew he wouldn't eat it if I did that! heehee

The first time I made these I was a bit sketpical however they've quickly become a household favourite.  My husband prefers chocolate-type desserts but this is one he often asks for (and no chocolate)!   I've always made them in a cookie sheet with sides.  I prefer them more like a brownie and less like cake.  I'll be using this recipe for many years to come!

I've made these twice now - the first time for a potluck at work.  I received numerous requests to make them again.  I took the advise of other reviewers and made the following changes: used 3 eggs; used the 30 oz can of pumpkin, added 1 tsp pumpkin pie seasoning; used 8 oz of cream cheese and doubled all of the other ingredients in the frosting.  WONDERFUL!!!

I have made this recipe twice now and it's delicious.  I wouldn't call them "bars" though.  If you follow the recipe exactly, they make 24 perfect cupcakes; moist and yummy.  And the icing is amazing and ices all 24 with a smidge extra for tasting.  : )  I do add a touch of milk to the icing.  Make them!

Oh my lord.  These were to die for!  I only used 3 eggs instead of 4, used half cinnamon flavored applesauce and half veg. oil, to cut out some calories and a whole 29 oz can of Libby's Pumpkin.  I had to increase the baking time about 20 minutes or so, and they were perfection! Oh, and I didn't use as much b. powder and b. soda as called for, to make them more dense.  And I followed the frosting recipe to a T and it was delicious!  I baked it in a 9x13 inch baking dish, too.  Will be making again for sure!

I really have enjoyed this recipe! I have had many compliments on these bars and even a recipe request. They are moist and delicious. I did use 1/3 oil and 1/3 melted butter since I ran out of canola oil and a 9x13" pan which I baked for about 40 minutes since it was thicker. This recipe is a keeper!

I LOVE these! I've made them over 20 times, and I can tell you that everyone I've ever made them for loves them! I also make these in a vegan version (which I think is a bit sweeter)...using egg replacement and soy cream cheese and soy margarine. Turns out perfect everytime!! :)

Took these to a New Years eve party, and people who hated pumpkin loved these!  There were still a few left when we were going to leave, and I had people packing them up to take home so that we "didn't have to haul them home!"

My coworkers love this and ask for it on their birthdays!  They can't wait until lunch to eat it so we eat it for breakfast.  I like to make mine more cake-like so I pour all batter into a 9x13 pan and bake a little longer and spread frosting on the top.

Yummy! My 4 sons and I made these together, and we followed the recipe ALMOST exactly. The only thing we did differently was that we used fresh pumpkin puree, which we prepared earlier in the day. We measured out 15 oz. of the puree (since the directions were to use a 15 oz. can). The mixture was a little bit more watery then it would have been using the canned stuff, so we just baked it about 20 minutes longer. It came out absolutely delicious. The frosting/icing is a perfect compliment to all of the other autumn flavors going on in the bars/cake (we baked it in a 13X9 pan, so ours came out more cake-like). Thanks for the recipe!

Smashing recipe! These are so moist. I like making the night before so the flavors mature. Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Used everything else as specified in recipe except for the frosting. I prefer browned butter icing. I have a favorite recipe I use. I took them to my coffee group and they were devoured in no time. NOTE: I cut cooking time by 5 minutes. Test with tooth pick.

These bars are very good. I made the recipe EXACTLY as presented here. The next time, I think I will increase the pumpkin and decrease the oil slightly to give more pumpkin flavor.

Really good, Very simple.  I added 1/2c. of maple syrup and cut back on the sugar.  The kids loved it.

I'm not sure it's right to label this 5 star since I changed the recipe a bit but it turned out awesome and I can only assume the that original recipe will turn out just as awesome.  

I used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  My jelly roll pan was larger than 10x15 but it made the bars thinner.  I also used the following cream cheese recipe because I like "cheesier" icing:

- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 3 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

These got RAVE reviews from all who ate them.

I used ~ 3/4 C Smart Balance oil and substituted 1 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice for one of the tsp. of cinnamon.

This is a nice recipe for the fall.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought that these were okay, but as others stated, they were more like a cake then a bar. Very fluffy, not that that is a bad thing but it wasn't what I had anticipated the texture to be like. I will decrease the eggs by one next time. I also added more spice and it still wasn't enought. I added nutmeg, cloves and a tad more cinnamon.

I must have done something wrong, although I am a pretty experienced baker. These were absolutely delicious, but very, very wet - not the kind of wet that abates with cooling.   I found that I had to cut them into tiny bars because if they were bigger they would break in half when someone picked one up. Next time, I will experiment with a slight decrease in wet ingredients and/or a longer baking time.

I thought these were great. I used the larger sized can of pumpkin (thirty oz) and reduced the eggs to 3 based on the suggestions given below, and they were dense but not too heavy, and the flavor was fabulous.  I really recommend them.

Oh, and my oven runs high, so I had to check them starting around twenty minutes.

These were great. Taste and consistancy is similar to spice cake.  Not your traditional "bar." But great and very popular with guests.

after reviewing some of the suggestions, i changed just about the entire recipe. and they turned out AMAZING! all my friends asked for seconds. one even suggested i could make a small fortune selling them! here are the ingredients that i changed: 3 eggs, instead of all white sugar i used 2/3c. white and 1c. brown, 1/2c. applesauce and 1/2c. veg oil, 30oz. pumpkin puree, 1t. baking powder, 3t. cinnamon, and i added a half bag of milk chocolate chips. i doubled the frosting, and used a vegan spread instead of butter. (but i cut the amount by about a third.) everyone commented on how good the frosting was and no one could tell it wasn't butter. next time i will try another reviewer's suggestion of tofu cream cheese. this is now a staple recipe.

I wasn't sure how I should rate this one.  This recipe is a pumpkin cake, not a "pumpkin bar".  For that reason, I was dissappointed in the end result and decided to rate it 3 stars.  Pour the batter into a 9x13 pan and you have a delicious pumpkin cake instead which is what I will do in the future.    
Note:  for overall flavor as a cake recipe, I would give it 5-stars.

Excellent!  For some reason they are addictive.  As with other reviewers, I substituted some of the white sugar for brown sugar.  I also added more spice: allspice and cardamom.  I will make again.

These were a hit at our ritual Sunday football gatherings.  They were a little oily, next time I will use 1/2 cup of applesauce insted of a full cup of oil.  I also substituted maple syrup for vanilla, which was amazing.  Great Recipe!!!!!

Although this recipe is titled as Bars it is more cake like as many have already mentioned and I love them as is! Very moist! The only thing I needed to do was at least double the amount of frosting so that it covers all of the cake.

These were good--but still not "bar like" to me.  I was looking for less fluffy, more dense like pumpkin bread.

As if this recipe needs any more rave reviews!! I served this at an IMPORTANT company function over the weekend and everyone is beating down my door for the recipe! I make it in a 9x12 pan and just up the time by 5 minutes, or until when a toothpick comes out clean. They are still talking about how moist, light and delish this is! The icing is to die for! Thanks Deb!!

Also, I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.

Definitely a keeper. I tried applesauce in place of the oil as suggested by several of the reviewers. Then I tried the oil. The oil makes for a moister, better-tasting pumpkin bar!

EVERY time I've made these I get loads of compliments. Great seller at the school bake sale.
VERY EASY TO MAKE!, I only used 1/4 c. of the butter in the frosting though. They look nice if you decorate each piece w/ candy corns. thanks for a good recipe!

This was more of a cake.  I used a regular cake pan and cooked it for about 8 minutes longer since it was in a deeper pan.  This was so good.  After I frosted it I placed it in the fridge and its very good cold.  I also added a little bit of pumpkin pie spice as well.

Although, like others said, they're not quite "bars", it was more like cake, but a very delicious one I might add. My boyfriend liked it alot & kept calling it my "pumpkin cake" instead of my pumpkin bars.  Did add 1 tsp nutmeg.I used the recipe cream cheese frosting II from this site.

I love the frosting on these!  The word "bar" doesn't quite fit though, they are way too soft and moist (like a cake) but I still give it a great rating because they are so yummy...next time I will take others suggestions and add more spice though.

Terrifically moist and tasty but the recipe calls for a massive sugar overload, especially in the icing. I used 3/4 of the recommended amount and it still came out way too sweet.  Otherwise, pretty delicious and seemed to get even better after 1, 2 days (refrigerated).  Just awfully sweet for any taste, I think.  TIP: using brown sugar instead of white is fine too.

These were OK, nothing spectacular. No one was excited about them at my house and we have a whole half pan left over. 

Yes, they were very moist but almost to the point of feeling damp. I substituted 3/4 cup apple butter for oil to cut the fat in the recipe so maybe this contributed to the dampness.

The taste was nothing special. I messed up the frosting but it looked like it would have been good.

Good taste and flavor - nice and moist - but the topping cracked as I tried to cut them so it wasn't very pretty.  I had placed it in the refrigerator though overnight and thought I had allowed ample time to soften at room temp.

I used 1/2 unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 oil.  Also for the frosting used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and no butter. (Doubled the frosting).  I think that it could probably be made with all applesauce without sacrificing any flavor.  Very Good.  Everyone, including my picky husband loved  them.

This came out of the oven like a beautiful cake! I hated to slice this up into bars because the cake presentation was so pretty.  I iced with the cream cheese frosting, let the frosting harden, cut into bars, then wrapped them up individually with saran wrap, and tied off the ends with pretty orange ribbon.  I brought these to my friend's home in a cute Halloween bowl and everyone raved over these treats. These are so moist and delicious!

These were easy and as they are cooking now I can only hope they are as good as the batter was.  I used 1/2c. sweetened applesauce and 1/2c oil (what I had on hand) and then reduced the sugar.  I also added nutmeg, cloves and a little powdered ginger and some chopped walnuts and more cinnamon, even still it's missing something, maybe a little orange rind in the batter or icing?

The best cake I've ever had...can't believe I MADE IT!!! It's so moist and fluffy and the perfect amount of sweet-I used less sugar.
The substitutions I made were:
Less sugar-About 1 1/3  C
Homemade pumpkin puree (used more than 15oz)
Used 1/2 C olive oil 1/2 C Apple sauce 
Only 1C confectioners sugar 
And creamed by hand since I don't have mixer
Will certainly make this again!

I have made these a couple of times and they are delicious.  I have made from the original recipe but doubled the frosting and have made with changes to make it more brownie like. (3 eggs, less baking powder, soda, stc)  I actually like the original recipe the best. the recipe with the changes, reminds me of eating a piece of pumpkin pie, just a little more dense.  But, I really think you need to double the frosting!

This is really strange.   The other day, I printed out a pumpkin bar recipe that had 5 stars and was Paula Dean's recipe.  This recipe  is the same as hers.  I used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and I personally didn't like it very much.  The bars had no flavor - they really need some cloves, allspice, ginger.  I also thought they were too "oily."  I would have liked them to be more cake-like.  I will try another recipe next time.

I love pumpkin and was looking for a new recipe. This was great. As I also love cloves, I cut the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon cloves and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. Thanks for the great recipe.

You seriously dont have to look any further,  I've made so many different kinds of pumpkin bar recipes and this one's the best. Only thing I added was a tsp of nutmeg and a tsp of pumpkin pie spice.

These are PERFECT and EVERYONE loves them. All of my teenager's friends BEG me to make them, but when I do, my three kids don't want me to leave the house with them! They are moist and delicious. The only change is that I double the frosting and to keep it easy, I use an extra ounce of cream cheese. Frankly without doubling the frosting is a little greesy. Frosting recipe as follows: 2 sticks of butter, 1 block of cream cheese, 1 box of powdered sugar and the vanilla, however much you like. They are crazy easy too. Haven't figured out how to transport large batches though since you can't stack them...working on it! :)

Very moist and light cake-like pumpkin recipe. Exactly what I was looking for to duplicate one my mom used to make. Used applesauce in place of oil. These get better after a day or two!

Beware- you may gain a few pounds eating these!  I followed others' suggestions using 3 eggs, double the pumpkin, added some extra cinnamon, plus a pinch of nutmeg and cloves.  Used about 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, and it was still extremely moist! For the frosting, used 6 oz cream cheese instead of 3 oz, and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  They were a huge hit and were gone fast!  This recipe is a keeper!

Added freshly ground nutmeg to deepen the flavor but otherwise left it alone so I could truly try the recipe.  Got WOW reviews, even from those who don't like pumpkin.  A keeper!

I've made these 3 times this fall and they are always a hit!  Very tasty pumpkin and spice cake-like bars.  I used applesauce instead of the oil and they were still very moist and yummy.  My kids had no idea they were eating a "healthier" pumpkin bar.  I've also served them with and without the cream cheese frosting...both ways are always devoured in no time.

This recipe is fantastic!  It is much more like pumpkin cake then bars, but it's extremely moist.  And I really liked the powdered sugar frosting recipe.

I baked a cake using this recipe.  Very good!  I made a little changes: cut the sugar in 11/2:cup, with half brown sugar.  I also added a teaspoon pumpkin spice since my husband like rich flavor.  The cake is very moist and soft.  Really good!  Next time I use this recipe again, I will put parchment paper around the baking pan so the edges wil keep as soft as the center.  Thanks a lot!

I did not follow the directions to a tee. I added ground clove and nutmeg. Approx. a 1/4 tsp of each. The bars were very moist and tasty.

Made it with store frosting because I can't do frosting. Used fresh pumpkin puree (2 cups) with 3 eggs instead of 4 to make it less cakey. One of the best things that I have ever made.

Very good recipe. Instead of using 1c oil, I use 1c greek yogurt. I made the recipe as originally written before trying the yogurt. The yogurt doesn't change the final product too much, but makes it a lot healthier.

I used applesauce instead of oil and it turned out great. 
For the frosting I cut the recipe in half and it was just enough. 

I also made 1/2 the recipe into Muffins and the other 1/2 as bars in a smaller pan.

If you are pouring the batter into a 9x13 pan, expect cakey bars.  If you pour it into the pan suggested in the recipe, you're good to go.  Either are good to me, I'm not picky!  Just be warned the 9x13 does take longer to bake.  In effort to make them healthier, I substitute the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and they're still delicious.  They freeze well, too!

Super yummy.  Cake is fluffy and moist.  This will be a regular recipe for fall, a couple times a year at least.    I like the jelly roll pan size, making a good thickness for snacking... The only adjustments I made to this recipe were to the spices and frosting.  I didn't add a full teaspoon of salt, but next time I will, as I think it would have rounded out the spice flavors.  In addition to the cinnamon in the ingredient list, I added: 1 tsp cardamon, 1/4 tsp ginger.  For the frosting I wanted more cream cheese than butter, so I used 4 oz cream cheese, 1/4 c butter. Try this recipe! You won't be sorry.

Per other reviews I only used 3 eggs, and substituted half the oil for applesauce.  These were definitely more cake like than brownie or other consistency.  I used a 9x13 dish because it was what I had, so they were thicker like cake.  The frosting is fantastic and worked well with the bars.  Very popular at work.

Yummy, but I think they should be made in a 10X15 jelly roll pan.  Otherwise it is like a cake.

Very cake like, but everyone raved about it. When adding oil & eggs together the consistency is very wet/runny, so try to achieve "light & fluffy" after adding in the flour!

After trying this myself and getting something that tasted great, but rose too much like cake I followed the advice of others and edited the ingredients as follows:  I added 4 cups of pumpkin puree, only used 3 eggs, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 2/3 c white sugar, 2/3 c brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cloves, and 1 tsp nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.  I baked in a 10x16 cake pan that was greased and powdered to prevent sticking.  I had to bake it for 45-50 minutes.  In the middle of baking it seemed to rise a bit, but ended up flattening back down by the time it was cooked through.

Just what I was looking for.  Only change I made was adding 1 Tsp of Pumpkin Pie spice, and sprinkled some crushed Pecans on top.  Will definitely make again!!

I thought these were delicious.  I've been using this recipe for a few years and everyone loves them.  I only make them to bring somewhere because I don't want to eat too many if they are around my house!  I'm not sure what the people who said they were "cakey" were expecting.  In my experience "Pumpkin Bars" are always cake-like.  If you are expecting something different, I would look for a different recipe.  I think it's just something people have always called them because you make them in a "bar" or jelly roll pan?  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, I think I always add in spices (I only make these once a year so sometimes I forget) that seem right at the time.

Great recipe as written! Very moist with a nice flavor that is not as spicy as the usual pumpkin bread, more like a carrot cake spice.  Be sure to use the jellyroll pan or a large cookie sheet (bigger than 9x13) to bake these in or you will have a "cake". I'll bake these again!

Doubled the pumpkin and used 3 eggs as suggested Circekitty. That was just what the original recipe needed.

This was a hit.  This is more like a cake than a bar, and I love that there was not an overabundance of frosting.  I added a smidgeon of ground cloves as a personal preference and used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce.

I wanted to bake something with pumpkin and I found this recipe... I read a couple of reviews but decided to make it just the way the recipe said (ok, not really, I added wallnuts)... and WOW!!!!!!!!!! I can't stop going to the kitchen to eat. Everytime I say to myself "ok, this is it for today". My boyfriend thought it was delicious!!! I didn't make the frosting because I didn't have the ingredients... I bet it's even better but it's REALLY GOOD without it. 
It's true that it doesn't have a bar consistency, it's more like a cake. But a terrific cake!!!

AMAZING! A few small modifications made them bar-like and NOT cakey.  I used a 29oz can of pumpkin, just 3 eggs, and halved the baking soda and powder.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon each of ground cloves and nutmeg.  They came out so good that my hubby "sampled" them til about half gone lol and the rest didn't make it til morning.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it for the first time tonight and I am very pleased with the results.  I'm really glad I read through the reviews and followed some of the advice.  I followed the recipe for the most part, though I used a 30 oz can of pumpkin, 1 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup white, 3 eggs, and I added a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon.  I baked it in a 10x14 glass dish, and it took maybe 40 minutes at 350.  I started checking it at 28 minutes, and even though the toothpick came out clean, the middle jiggled too much.  I checked it every few minutes and when it didn't jiggle anymore I took it out.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-cheese-frosting-ii-2/detail.aspx), halving the recipe and piping it onto the bars rather than spreading it.  It looked really pretty and the taste complimented the bars perfectly.

I used some ideas from other reviewers, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 canola oil, wheat flour, pumpkin spice and a large can of pumpkin. These bars came out very dense and looked under cooked but it was soo moist with the extra pumpkin added. Next time, I'm gonna the 15oz. can and see the difference. They lasted 1 day in my house, guess they loved them!!

I made his exactly as written, adding some extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. I don't have a jelly roll pan, so I made it in a 9x13 pan, which made the bars thick enouh to be called cake. They were divine, very moist. I don't really like pumpkin, but I liked this, and so did the rest of the family. A nice, seasonal recipe.

The only thing that I changed was adding more spice to the batter - nutmeg, ginger, allspice.  These were really delicious - moist and flavorful with just the right amount of frosting. Oh and lined my pan with parchment which made it all easier.

Not so much.  Granted, I did try others suggestions and used more pumpkin, and less sugar and oil.  I'm sure that effected the outcome.  Not what I was looking for.

These are pretty good and my family likes them. I added more spices (cloves, nutmeg, more cinnamon) They are a little dense for my taste.  Great standard recipe for frosting though.

I used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. Changed prep a bit to beat sugar and eggs together until fluffy, add oil and beat til smooth and then beat in pumpkin until smooth and fluffly. Added dry ingredients a little at a time, beating after each addition and stirred in a cup of chopped walnuts. I ended up with too much for a 10 x 13" pan so used my sheet cake pan. Bars were about 2" high and so delightfully moist and flavorful. This recipe goes into my recipe notebook. Thanks for sharing this.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  These are fantastic!  I generally don't care for pumpkin dishes but this one has such a delicious mellow pumpkin flavor and they are soooo moist without being oily.  I made these for a work function (makes a good-sized batch, perfect for potlucks) and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  Also made these for a party at my house in the Fall but knew that some guests didn't care for cream cheese so I kept a few unfrosted and they were still awesome.  Definitely make them with the frosting though if you don't have picky non-cheese eaterpants around.

Love this recipe!  To add a little southern flaird, I used canned sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin.  Worked out fabulously.

I took some others advice and increase the pumpkin to 30 oz and increased the cream cheese in the frosting to 8 oz.  These bars are great - they are sticky and soft like the inside of a pumpkin pie, but cakey enough to hold their shape on a plate.  I have made them several times as a hostess gifts and they have always disappeared quickly.

These were a total hit!  I made them like some of the others and deleted an egg to make them more bar like.  Before putting them in the oven I topped with white choc and butterscotch chips.  Frosted them, and them meted butterscotch chips with a little cream and drizzled it on top, made them extra pretty and taste even better!  These have now been added to the yearly Thanksgiving menu.  Be warned they are super rich, but isn't that what dessert is all about?!

They were excellent. I did make the changes many noted - including using a 29 oz can of pumpkin and adding a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and only 3 eggs.  It does puff up like a cake - I think next time I'll use less baking powder. I didn't have a jelly roll pan, so I used two 8x8 pans.  For the frosting I used 6oz of cream cheese. Will make again!

This is really a sheet cake, but who cares about semantics? Add a half teaspoon of ginger and a quarter teaspoon of cloves to the batter and double the cream cheese in the frosting....5+ stars! I have made this a few times each fall for many years and it's always a favorite.

These are wonderful exactly as the recipe is written! For those who are saying they are too "cakey", a pumpkin bar is supposed to be more cakey as opposed to dense like a cookie bar. These are perfect!

I'm not a huge fan of spice, but I think these may have been missing something...it was really good though.  I did use my own cream cheese frosting recipe.  Everyone said it was cake, so I made cupcakes with them and it worked out very nicely. UPDATED: added raisins to this and they were AMAZING!

I agree with other reviewers that these are more cake-like than bar-like.  But who cares- they're delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.

This recipe made alot!  Extremely moist with a wonderful flavor.  I followed the recipe except I added fresh ground nutmeg, vanilla and used fresh pumpkin in place of canned.  The frosting recipe as is worked perfect, just enough to thinly cover the bars without being too sweet.  The large pan size is perfect for sharing!

I made this for a cookout this weekend with friends. It was a great hit. I made the exact recipe for the bars only adding raisins and pecans. Did use 8oz. cream cheese and doubled the rest of frosting recipe. It was perfect. Thanks for the great addition to my recipe box.

Excellent pumpkin bars. I followed the tips from CIRCEKITTY and filled the pan perfectly. Did the frosting just as she also suggested, although it made a little more than needed. I also added raisins to the bars (growing up mom put raisins in our pumpkin cookies -- which I LOVED) which added a nice touch.

These were really good as is. I halved the recipe, and made it in a 11 x 7 glass pan.  I put chopped pecans on one side for me and golden raisins on the other for my hubby.  He loved it!  The frosting is really good too.  I did use 6 oz. of an 8 oz. cream cheese, as it's what I had on hand, instead of 4 oz. It was just right for two of us.

Used one other reviewers modifications (omit one egg, used 30 oz. pumpkin pie mix, ect.) and they were perfect. I, by mistake, left out the veg oil and they really were perfect and I suppose they were probably a little bit better for us without it. Also for the frosting I followed her suggestion for the frosting and used 8 oz. cream cheese and doubled everything else, but I only had 1 1/2 cups butter and the frosting came out perfect. It did make way too much though.

I made this recipe at least 2-3 times and brought it to work. My husband and my coworkers went crazy over it. Many have asked me for the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe when you have to bring something as a contribution for a potluck holiday party or just because your family is craving pumpkin sweets!!!

I used another reviewer's suggestions as follows, and had great results: "I cut out one egg and ½'ed the baking powder and baking soda. I also added ½ tsp. of cloves and ½ tsp. of nutmeg. I thought they turned out great!! VERY moist, and exactly like I wanted. For the frosting, I used 8 oz of cream cheese and 3 cups of powdered sugar, which made about ½ cup more than I needed. A GREAT recipe!"

I’ve made these a few times, and this is an awesome recipe but I followed users suggestions and cut down the eggs to only 3, replaced the oil for unsweetened applesauce and added 1/4 teas nutmeg. I didn’t think the frosting was cream cheesy enough so I used 2-8oz packages and doubled the vanilla. Made these for a birthday party and many people asked me for the recipe! (I learned the hard way too, dont use a 9X13 pan, the bars were way too thick and didn’t get done in the middle. Follow the directions and use the jelly pan)

I followed this recipe as stated these Pumpkin Bars were a big hit at our family gathering.  Note: They are very dense and still showed the spatula grooves from when I spread them in the pan after baking.  I used cream cheese frosting to cover them.  These defintely would have been even better with some golden raisins in them.

I love this and it is a favorite go-to recipe when pumpkin is in the house.  They are so fluffy.  I have used both canned and home cooked pumpkin as well as added a little extra when I've had it and all worked well.

I think this is good as a starter recipe.  I added extra pumpkin and still the flavor didn't "wow" my husband who just loves the recipe we usually use.  I think if I were to make this again I would definitely add more spice.  I just seemed a bit bland.  Other than that, it definitely is moist and looks very appealing.

Very good. I used 30oz pumpkin, 1/2 c oil, and added pumpkin pie spice. I also used a different cream cheese frosting recipe because I don't feel right using only 3oz of cream cheese in a 15x10 pumpkin bar.

These are so good!  The only changes I made was adding around 1/2 t of pumpkin pie spice with the cinn. and using 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 3 oz.  I could eat the whole pan at once!  But I won't.  :)

I got SO many compliments on these. I made two industrial sized pans full of these bars to feed about 100 people. Everyone absolutely loved them.

I cut down on the eggs (1), used half of the amount of baking powder called for, and added 1 tsp ground cloves and 1 tsp nutmeg. All of these amendments were suggested by another reviewer for a more "bar-like" result. I also opted to use wheat flour for half of the amount of flour called for, and splenda for half of the amount of sugar called for. This healthed it up a little, with out sacrificing on flavor! :)

These were a huge hit the first time I made them for a party.  I followed Circekitty recommendations and omitted 1 egg, used 30 0z of pumpkin, and added additional pie spice.  They were perfect.  The second time I made them I tried substituting applesauce for most of the oil and they turned out very, very heavy and too moist.  Will not do that again.

This recipe is delicious! I made a half recipe in a 9 x 9 pan for a bit thicker bar, I added 1T pumpkin pie spice, I used the recipe's frosting and sprinkled walnuts on top. It was moist and perfect. This is cake like, fluffy and wonderful. 

I finished the pan too quickly and decided to make another batch in a light version using egg beaters, applesauce, splenda and adding 1 C fat free vanilla yogurt. They turned out wonderfully! Add some FF cool whip and you have nice desert. And only 1 WW point per serving for 18 servings not 24 as recipe states (half recipe in 9 x 9 pan makes 9 servings). I will definitely make the regular and light versions again.

Nice and moist, prepared as written and baked in jelly pan (cookie sheet with sides)  Added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves.  Made a nice frosting, too!

So tasty. I used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup white sugar, ½ cup brown sugar, ½ cup veg oil, ½ cup unsweetened applesauce, and then I used the rest of the bar ingredients as listed. For the frosting, I used 8 oz light cream cheese, 2 TBS butter, 2 tsp vanilla, and around 2 cups confectioners' sugar. I didn't measure the sugar, just added it until it was right. The frosting was rich and delicious, and the base was fabulous and moist. And much healthier with half the oil! Woo! Thanks for sharing, Deb!

These were very good. I wanted just a little more flavor in the cake itself - just a little more spice. So I might try that next time. But I'll definitely make these again. I didn't change anything except adding a bit more cream cheese in the frosting.

These were good, but nothing spectacular.  I got lots of compliments, but I guess I am not a pumpkin bar person.

Mmmmm. These are awesome! The only modification I made was to use 1 cup white sugar and 2/3 cup brown sugar - and I completely forgot to add the salt - but they didn't need it! They're just amazing. Went through two huge pans in two days at work. YUMMO! **UPDATE** I've made these at least a dozen times now. In addition to splitting the sugar, I add 1/2 tsp each of pumpkin pie spice, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg. They're amazingly spicey and people go gaga over them!!

This is easy to make and delicious.  Other posters are right in that it has more of a spongy cake consistency rather than a chewy bar consistency.  But, it's still really good.  I decreased the cinnamon to 1.5 teaspoons and added 1/4 teaspoon each of ground cloves and ginger.  I also added another ounce of cream cheese to the icing recipe.  I've made this recipe to take to two "outings" and people have loved it.

This is an awesome, awesome recipe. Even just taste testing the batter, I can easily say it beats any pumpkin pie or cake that I've ever had! (But, don't tell my aunts that) I made adjustments similar to many reviewers. 30oz can of Libby's Pumpkin Pie mix...I don't think it would have been as tasty otherwise. Cut down the sugar to 1.25 cups...I think brown sugar would have been really good here. Maybe .75 cups each. I added a little extra splash of vanilla because I didnt think it could go wrong and I added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice to the mix and sprinkled cinnammon on top before I baked them. I made mine in greased and floured 8x8 pans (they won't really be bars...more like slabs). DO NOT use a different icing. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting 2 on this site and was sadly dissapointed. Give the icing recipe on here a try, I wish I had!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I done different was I lined my pan with non-stick foil and then poured the batter in and baked.  Once done and cool to the touch, I took a sharp knife and sliced down the edges to loosen from the pan. Then my husband and I each grabbed one end of the foil gently lifting up and out of the pan.  With the them now laying on the counter and still on the foil, I iced and used a pizza cuter (the wheel kind) and sliced right through with ease. Making great sized bars.  I then let the icing set a bit and used a small brownie spatula to lift them up off the non-stick foil with ease and placed in a sealed container. It worked with ease! oh yeah, for such a simple recipe, these are always a hit with family and friends.

Not really a bar more of a cake but DELICIOUS anyway.  

I did modify as per suggested with 3 eggs instead of 4 and 30 ounces of Libby's pumbkin pie filling instead of the puree and I also used pumpkin pie spice.  

Wow these were good.  Glad we had to take them to a potluck or we would have eating the whole pan.

I'm giving this 5 stars because everyone who tried them loved them.  I took them to a holiday party, and everyone raved about them!  However, I had one right after I made them, and then another during the party, and each time I felt like I just dropped a lead brick in my stomach.  Not sure why, and I probably won't make them again, but, like I said, everyone else loved them.  They are very easy to make, so I would suggest trying them out for yourself.

Yummy!  Very moist.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar to make the icing, and then I only used about 1/2 of the icing and that was enough for my family.  Next time, I'll scale the icing part down & reduce the sugar again.

It's true that this is more of a cake than bars but its perfect. I made it in a 9 by 13 cake pan and baked for 35 min. I also added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. So delicious that the whole cake was gone in just an hour. The icing is good but the cake tastes great by itself also.

Good. Great the next time, with 3 eggs instead of 4 and 30 ounces of Libby's pumbkin pie filling instead of the puree
i also suggest you use Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe instead of this frosting version.

Fabulous! I actually followed the directions from reviewer 'ilstu99' posted underneath the recipe. Even with her changes it is still a cake; not a bar. But SO good! I did follow the original recipe for the cream cheese frosting. This was the best frosting I have ever had! Excellent cake! I will be making this again for sure!

I absolutely love pumpkin bars and have tried several recipes. This one is by far the best. I prefer more frosting so I double the frosting recipe by doubling all ingredients and using an 8 oz block of cream cheese. This recipe also fits nicely in a bar pan. Some of the others I tried were too much or too little.

Although these came out very moist and delicious and the icing was excellent, too, I have to give them 4 stars instead of 5 b/c they did come out more "cakey" than bar-like.  I also omitted an egg like 1 reviewer suggested and they still were too cakey, not that that's a bad thing -- they were wonderful, but I really wanted a pumpkin bar. Still, a great recipe!

I have made this on many occasions and everyone loves them!  I decreased the oil and added applesauce.  Also only used Three eggs.  Add more spice.  I don't care like the frosting, so I use one from a banana bar recipe.  With a few modifications, this recipe is a huge hit!  My co-workers, family and friends can't wait for me to make this again.

I recently made this recipe and modified it as suggested, using 3 eggs, and some cinnamin, nutmeg and cloves. I was so excited to try this, because I love pumpkin. I made it in a jelly roll pan, and found them to be very wet, almost more like a pumpkin pie texture. My husband thought I hadn't cooked them enough, but I had. The cream cheese frosting was very good, but I don't think I will be making these again.

I'm new to allrecipes.com, but when I made these pumpkin bars, everyone who ate them really liked them. There were no leftovers! They also taste great without the cream cheese icing, so if you are counting calories, you don't need to add the icing.

I have been using this exact same recipe since High School some 20 years ago.  RAVE reviews each and every time.  In addition to making bars, I also make it as a cake using 9 inch pans.  I also top these with walnuts which I think gives it something extra as far as flavor.

the "bar" (it's a cake) has a good texture and is moist but is almost completely flavorless. I would at *least* double the spices in this. Horrible, bland bars. On the up side, most people will say anything with cream cheese frosting is delicious, so double the amount and slather it on if you must make these.

I've made this twice and have gotten lots of compliments both times.  The only changes I've made are adding more spice (more cinnamon, allspice, vanilla, ground cloves, ground nutmeg) to the dry mix.  Tastes great!

These are absolutely wonderful!! My husband loves them! When they say they are moist, they are not lying, these are very moist. I made them for a friend, which doesn't care for pumpkin, but she loved these. I am forwarding her the recipe! This is a keeper for our family, for sure! Thanks, for the great recipe!!

These were good! I agree with the other reviewers that this is more like a cake, so be prepared to serve it that way. I followed this recipe as written with a couple of minor changes: I used whole wheat flour, added 1/2c chocolate chips, added 1/2tsp pumpkin pie spice, and added 1/2tsp nutmeg. I also added 1/2tsp cinnamon to the frosting. Some people said there wasn't enough frosting, but I thought there was plenty.

Awesome! Baked in a 9x13 pan and prepared the frosting dairy-free. Substitued the cream cheese with soy cream cheese (Tofutti's Better Than Cream Cheese) and margerine instead of butter.

These were amazing Pumpkin Bars.  I don't like Pumpkin really, but I decided to make these for a gathering because of the season, and everyone LOVED them.  Even I loved them.  The frosting is excellent. One guest who has very sensative teeth said the amount of sugar got to her a little.  I forgot to add baking soda to mine, but they still turned out great.  This recipe yeilds a LOT of pumpkin bars.

My family loved them.  I wouldn't hesitate to make them for company.  I added some walnuts on top of the frosting and may add some more spices next time, but I would give it 5 starts even without these changes.  I also increased the cream cheese to 8 oz.

Love this recipe - it turned out great!  I added 1 tsp. of nutmeg, but still think it could be a bit spicier.  Next time I will add all spice as well.

These were excellent! Very easy to make. I made them for dinner guests and they loved them. I do think that I will add more spices to them next time. I also sprinkled finely chopped walnuts on top of the cream cheese icing.

These are good. This was the first time I made them and I messed up. For some reason I didn't mix the sugar in with the pumpkin, eggs, and oil (I used unsweetened applesauce)I accidently put the sugar in with the dry mixture. They turned out fine. Not sure if they are exactly perfect, but no one would erver know! As for the taste I thought they could use more spice. The icing was great, I made extra, I like a lot of icing!

I stuck to the recipe but added some nutmeg to the cinnamon.  To me, pumpkin bellows for the 'spices' and I couldn't resist!  For the icing, I cut way down on the butter, went up to 8oz of cream cheese and used under 2 cups of icing sugar.
I think I'll try to spice it up a bit more next time and use half applesauce to replace the oil.  Overall, an easy recipe which is quite yummy!  Thank you!

I have made these twice and both times the entire pan has been emptied in less than an hour.     I may try to use less oil and sub applesauce in the future to keep calories and fat down.     Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

These are so moist they almost taste like pumpkin pie without the crust!  To cook them in a normal baking dish (8x11), I changed the servings to 18.  It worked great.

Cake, bars, call it or cut it how you will; it's delicious.
Don't have a big pan, so used a 13x9 and baked a little longer.
Didn't have time to make the cr. cheese frosting and it was still sooo tasty.  Mmmm.

I agree that this makes more of a cake than bars, but who cares? they're's SO good. I promised my sister last summer that I would make these for Thanksgiving, and whenever she called me from then on, she reminded me of my promise. I'd have been disowned if I forgot to make them.

I make these atleast 2 times/month!  This is our absolute favorite dessert...any time of year!  Only difference for me is that I use 4 cups powdered sugar for the frosting (when I first received this recipe, it called for that) so I never knew any different and don't see reason to change! Wonderful!

Very good recipe.  I am going to add some pumpkin pie spice or more cinnamon to the  cake batter next time I make it to add a little more flavor.  The icing is very good.  They flew off the plate at a recent party.

Turned out great! Added the extra pumpkin pie spice & cinnamon per other readers suggestions, otherwise followed regular directions.  I like the cake-like consistency personally.  Was also  surprised the frosting was plentiful.  Personal choice to refrigerate before serving.  Yum yum!  Who needs pumpkin pie when you have this recipe!

This wasn't the first time I made pumpkin bars, but by far, these were the best. VERY MOIST!, although I used my own recipe of cream cheese frosting, use 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 3 oz. more cream cheese flaver

These bars are delicious! I think they are more like cake then bars. Like other reviewers, I added extra cloves and nutmeg to the mix. I think the bars may have been too bland without the extra spice. The bars almost overflowed the 10x15 jelly roll pan I used which made frosting a bit tricky.  The frosting recipe made plenty to cover the bars generously. I will definitely make these again!

Fantastic recipe!  The only things I changed were 1)I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil 2) I used fresh pumpkin puree and 3) I used 1 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup white sugar......
These were incredibly moist and absolutely delish!

This recipe was a hit with our UMW group.  I made a caramel icing since I didn't have cream cheese.  I would add nuts to the icing next time.

Perfection!  These were wonderful.  Unlike others, I followed the recipe to the "T".  Took them to work and almost started a riot!  Fellow employees were taking more than their share and hiding them!!  Will absolutely make again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was awesome!! Again, a little more cake like than a bar, but who cares!!  Everyone loved them.  I cut them up into small squares and put a candy corn on top to decorate.  I didn't realize that the candy corn would absorb the moisture from the icing and get a little soft.  Everyone that that just topped it off perfectly.  YUM

I made this in a 9x13 pan, and had amazing Pumpkin cake. I did not wait for the cake to be completely cool, so my icing melted, but it was eaten in about 2 hours, the entire thing! I did not like it, because I do not like pumpkin, but everyone else loved it.

Yum!  So moist and tasty, even a few days later.  I brought 2 to work for a snack and ended up giving one to a co-worker who raved about it.  After reading previous reviews, I added a little more spice and slightly less leavening ingredients to make it even more flavorful and dense.  Excellent recipe.

These turned out very moist and the frosting was really good.  They do need some extra spice though.  I sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon and they were still a little bland.  Next time I will add 1 or 2 teaspoons of pie spice to really bring out the pumpkin flavor.  Otherwise these are perfect.

Very good.  I didn't have a large jelly roll pan, so I used one 9x13 and one 8x8 and it worked perfectly.
The bars were very good!!  The only thing I might add next time is some pumpkin spice or extra cinnamon.
Will make again for sure!!

It tastes just fine, a light pumpkin flavor. If I make it again I would definatly use more pumpkin.  Plus this is more like a cake then bars.  The cream cheese frosing was great, but I also don't have any other cream cheese frosting recipe.  I ended up doubling the cream cheese!!!
I made it again and it worked great 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil.  Plus I used 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup flour.  Added ginger and nutmeg to add more flavor.  Would use those changes again.  Probably next time I would use splenda instead of sugar to reduce the calories even more.

I have made this recipe many times.  It is so easy and always turns out perfect.  When making the frosting keep stirring it will seem like you need to add something else and then it mixes up perfectly!!!  This is a recipe all my family loves!!!

OH WOW! These were outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled the frosting recipe. This turned out so moist and delicious and my guests gobbled them down. Even 5 days later, they still taste moist and flavorful. I highly recommend this recipe!

Loved the recipe because it didn't use all the typical pumpkin spices so it was different than most.  Took it to work for "Pumpkin Day" and 4 different people wanted the recipe.  I think the oil instead of butter/margarine really makes a difference.  Followed the directions exactly - didn't add the nuts or raisins that so many other recipes have.  Tastes best when refrigerated.   Yumm!

These are excellent!  I have been making them for 2 years now and everyone loves them.  I just made them for a halloween party and cut out little pumpkin shapes using a pumpkin cookie cutter.  I always get asked for the recipe when I serve these.

Great recipe.  I also add 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and 1/2 tsp of ground ginger to the pumpkin mixture to spice up the cake a bit.  Optional additions - add raisins to the cake or walnuts sprinkled on top of the icing.  Everytime I make these I take home an empty pan.

Very good and easy to make.  This is more of a single-layer cake than a bar.  With the frosting, it reminded me of a spice cake, but made with pumpkin.  These were a big hit with everyone.  Definitely a good keeper recipe for fall!

Wonderful!  These pumpkin bars were gone during one sitting except one row, which was gone by the end of the night.  My husband demands that I make more today, because he loves them.  (And he isn't even a pumpkin fan) These were so moist, and delicious, would recommend to anyone!  It may seem like there are a lot of ingriedents or that it may be hard to make, but it really is quite simple, and yummy.

This one is the best.  Super easy to put together, and make the frosting while it is baking.  My children, who claim to not like pumpkin gobbled this up.  It also got rave reviews with my husband and neighbors.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks for a super recipe.

This was a fairly good recipe.  I thought that the batter was a little oily before it cooked, but it was moist.  I think it would be much improved with more spices, it was a little too boring for me.

Everyone who has tried these thinks they're the best Pumpkin Bars ever.  They always ask for the recipe.  By the way, I would recommend doubling the icing recipe if you like a least a 1/4 inch icing.

These are wonderful, very moist! Only thing I did different was use an 8 ounce brick of cream cheese for the frosting rather than just the 3 ounce. Delicious! Will make again.

With one exception it is Perfect! I like more cream cheese in my frosting! I make these all year round and have been asked to make several pans for funerals and benefits and family reunions!

I added a cup each of raisins & crushed walnuts to the recipe. Half I froze in the freezer without icing. The other half disappeared quickly and was delicious. Reminded me of my mom's pumpkin spice bars.

These taste just like the ones my husband remembered from his local grocery store up north.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and make them less cakey by using 3 eggs and half of the baking soda and baking powder.  I also added ground cloves and nutmeg.  I did cheat and use pre-made frosting, and they were still amazing.  Fabulous!!

The gal that said she posted this was right on the money. I still have the original recipe from the 70’s. It was in Parade and came on Sundays with the paper. 
They have a picture of the guy too. Sure he’s passed away now as he was an older gentleman. 

I love these bars!  Fabulous

Delicious and moist. My son-in-law is gluten intolerant so I made these with Krusteaz gluten free all purpose flour.  Everything else exactly as written. They were yummy. I did find that I had to bake them longer.  Highly recommend! Thank you.

10 stars minimum, after following CirceKitty's suggestions for the bars and the frosting.  I had too much frosting, but the amounts called for in the frosting description would not have been enough.  Thanks Paul!

I made this recipe into a 3 layered cake and it's delicious! I didn't change anything in the batter recipe but I did use Betty Crocker's cream cheese frosting instead of making it from scratch. I will definitely make this again!

I am reading all of the reviews and enjoying all of the ideas for the first time.  But to be honest, I make them each time just as the recipe was written and get plenty of great compliments.  If I modified I would try the unsweetened applesauce and half stevia for a diabetic husband.

Read all the reviews about them being too cake like and that is true but what really bothered me was the flavor.  They were bland.  Maybe some nutmeg, allspice etc.  Won't make again.

I've made these bars every fall for the past 4 years . My family ( especially my son ) can't get enough of them , I brings them to Xmas parties because they pack so well & also freeze wonderfully to the point they taste fresh every time . I love that the cream cheese frosting isn't so sweet that you can't taste the cream cheese flavor that we all want . If you bring these pumpkin bars ANYWHERE they will disappear & you will look like an amazing baker - even though they are so.... easy to make ; )

This made fabulous cupcakes. Very moist and flavorful! We love our icing, so I used a full 8 oz brick of cream cheese and adjusted the other icing ingredients accordingly. Already preparing to make it again this Thanksgiving, as I was informed it was a new (non-negotiable) tradition. :)

I have made this recipe as stated and although good, it was not the “moist yet dense” texture I was looking for but rather was more like a pumpkin “cake.”  As written it give it a four star. But with some changes it is definitely a five star. I live in Amish country, among some fabulous cooks and bakers, so I know a great pumpkin BAR when I taste it. After reading reviews, I finally made it for a ladies church gathering tonight and tried the suggestions offered by CIRCEKITTY and those changes definitely make it a five star BAR version (30 ounce pumpkin pie filling rather than canned pumpkin, three eggs rather than four, and a teas of pumpkin pie spice). For those who are looking for that bar texture (which really is quite different than the cake-type), try it this way. This was superb and got multiple compliments. I will make it this new way from now on

These tasted really good, but rose so much during baking that it essentially ended up as a cake. I used the size of pan that was indicated in the recipe. Perhaps an even larger pan would have been better, or I could have trimmed the top, but didn’t feel like wasting anything.

I do not like pumpkin and I thought these were amazing! The only changes I made were to use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, butter instead of oil and I did not sift the powdered sugar. So good!

This is a lovely autumnal treat.  I added 1/4 teaspoon each cloves, nutmeg and allspice and I baked it in a 9 x 11 pan (for convenience).  It was absolutely delicious and  even better on day #2.  Moist, flavorful and very simple to throw together!  Will make again and again!  Thank you for sharing!

Will definitely make again! I did adjust the ingredients by using only 3 eggs,  halved the baking soda & baking soda. I also used 30 oz. of pumpkin.  They came out just as I had hoped, very moist!!

I needed a recipe for a pot-luck that would serve many. Followed others advice & used a large can of pumpkin puree (796ml) and added the allrecipes Pumpkin Pie Spice recipe found on this site.  Used a recipe for icing that called for an 8oz (250gr) cream cheese as we like a little extra. This cut into 40 squares & added a couple of candy corns on top for decoration for the kids. This one's a keeper!

The best pumpkin bars....more like cake.  I’ve made this many times.  Everyone loves them.  There are no modifications needed to these.  They are perfect as is.   Don’t understand the reviews complaining about it being like cake.  Is it the name that’s throwing you?  Ignore the name.  These are perfect.

So tasty!! I was skeptical about not greasing the pan, but they turned out amazing. I think they are best WITHOUT the icing (and I usually enjoy very sweet things!)

It's really good! Probably my favorite thing to bake, deifntley would suggest making it. If you prefer it to be more like a cake, I would cook it longer. If you prefer a more pumpkin bread taste, then only do 25 minutes.

Love these bars! I read through a lot of reviews the first time and wanted to try the "brownie consistency" and not "cakey" so per some suggestions I used 29 oz of pumpkin puree, 3 eggs, half the baking soda and  powder, and added extra spice. Big mistake. Although we took it to a church potluck and everyone said they liked it, it turned out exactly like a pumpkin pie texture  - but in bar form! So I remade them following most of the recipe - the only changes I made was used 3 eggs, 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar,  and 1 tsp vanilla. Turned out perfect! They were just a tad thicker than cake (which wouldn't have been bad either) and just what I was looking for! Thanks, Paul. :) (I ended up using a different cream cheese frosting I fell in love with from this site.)

I've been looking for a pumpkin bar recipe for a while. I hoped to find the original recipe that was always on the Libby's pumpkin can. I seemed to have lost it. But I recognized the ingredients and instructions in Paul's Pumpkin Bar recipe. I made one pan with sugar and a second that was sugar free, I'm a type 2 diabetic . This cuts the carbs down significantly, and the calories.

Great recipe. Simple to make, easy to serve, stays moist.  I lost my other pumpkin bar recipe and used this in a pinch.  Not too sweet and good with vanilla ice cream.  I cut them into serving sizes in advance and had plenty to go around for a large group!

I bake this in a 9" x 13" pan, just add a few minutes onto the baking time. It makes for a moister cake!!!!!

I used 8 ounces of cream cheese rather than 3 ounces.  I’ve been making cream cheese frosting for decades and 2 cups of powdered sugar is appropriate for 8 ounces of cream cheese.  I wonder if this was simply a typo?  Otherwise the recipe is definitely 5 star.

This was delicious, and gets better in the fridge once the spices really meld together~ I added allspice, pumpkin spice and clove to the cinnamon in the batter and it really made for a wonderfully tasty cake. I sprinkled semi-sweet chocolate morsels on top of the batter before putting in the oven which added another level of flavor to it~ decadent! For the frosting~ I added more cream cheese, and then sprinkled a cinnamon-sugar mix on top. I will definitely be making this again!!

These are always a big hit at our thanksgiving dinner! I always double the recipe and use my 14x24 pan. I add a little cool whip to the cream cheese frosting and it gives it a marshmallow texture.

I loved ease and delicious results.  I cooked my own pumpkin (2 cups packed) and pureed it in my vitamix heavy duty blender with the 4 eggs and then added the other wet ingredients.   i replaced oil, with 1 cup melted butter and I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  and additional pumpkin pie spice and powdered ginger, 1 teaspoon each.  I still added the cinnamon to the dry ingredients and sifted them together. I replaced white flour for whole wheat white flour, and added 1 extra teaspoon baking powder to compensate.    I also added 1 package chocolate chips at end before pouring into the jelly roll pan.  I used 1/2 sheet size and found it filled the pan nicely.  I doubled all the cream cheese frosting ingredients and found this allowed for generous layer.  I topped my bars with gold sparkly dust and walnut halves.  This was for Thanksgiving, so all upgrades were taken.  It was a great recipe to adjust to personal liking.

Simply delicious. I used about 6 oz of cream cheese in the frosting, from other reviewers. Excellent!

These are really good pumpkin bars as written.  The second time I made them I added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice, decreased the cinnamon to one teaspoon, halved the butter in the frosting and they were amazingly good!

Amazing . I love the cake-like texture of this recipe better than bars.  Only change to the bars I made was subbing 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.  In the frosting, I put in 8 oz cream cheese and added 2 more cups of powdered sugar so I could essentially double the recipe and have extra for another cake, or to frost this thick.

I did not have a jelly roll pan so used a  10 x 8 lightly greased and floured tin.  Needed to bake 50 minutes at 350.   Turned out perfect.  Nice moist sheet cake.

Video says add 1 t. pumpkin pie spice, did that and made these with NO changes! Perfection!. DEELISH! 
Cakey? YES! I don't know why every reviewer is making so many changes, try the recipe as it is, it will not disappoint.

I rate recipes as written. I can see making several changes to this recipe that may make it edible. Unfortunately, I guess I'm the first person who doesn't like these pumpkin bars. They are seriously lacking in flavor. There must be something missing in the ingredients! The pumpkin cake itself, is awful!  Are you sure that sugar shouldn't be added? Feel bad for wasting all these ingredients, as I know this whole pan is going to end up in  the garbage.  Was going to give this recipe one (1 ) star, but decided to give it two (2) because the frosting was actually pretty good. A shame to waste such good frosting on such a poor tasting pumpkin cake. Yes, I should also mention that these are hardly what I'd call a "bar," as  it  actually has a cake like texture.

Made the recipe as-is, and while it puffed up twice the size that I expected it to, it was beautiful and delicious in every way! Everyone loved it, and it was super easy to make. Truly a one-in-a-million recipe for novice cooks like me!

These were published years ago in the Applehood & Motherpie cookbook put out by the Junior League of Rochester (1981), originally by Cecil R. Scuba. I’ve made them for people who claim they don’t like pumpkin & think they are spice bars, and they are always a big hit.

LOVED this recipe.  The only change I made was to  substitute 1/2 cup unsweetend applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, and it was delicious.   I actually served this to some of my family without icing and it was a hit.  I did icing the bars about 2 days later and it was still a winner.  I'll make this again.

This is a very good recipe!  I exchanged half a cup of the oil for a half cup of unsweeetened applesauce.  I also reduced the powdered sugar in the frosting by about a half cup.  Very easy to make and very well received by everyone I served them to.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Great flavor, moist and dense.  I added a little ginger and nutmeg, and used more cinnamon.  I spiced it like I do pumpkin pie.  The frosting is perfect.  This was a huge hit.

I made these and brought them to my husband's art class, they were a hit!  Then I made them for the assisted living complex where my mom lived and gave samples to the cooking staff....they loved them so much they copied the recipe and bake  it  for the residents...it was a huge hit!  Both times I didn't change a thing and results were fantastic.  Thanks for sharing.

SO DELICIOUS.
I did not have enough veggie oil so I made mine with canola oil. Came out delicious. Consistency wasn't any different than I imagined it to be with veggie oil. 

REMINDER: refrigerate bars after frosting as the frosting contains cream cheese (I forgot and was not able to serve them to guests because I was nervous I'd get them sick!)

Pretty good recipe although people were complaining that the bars were too cakey so I added 20-25 oz of pumpkin instead of 15 and it turned out very moist. Served it at a meeting and people loved it. Make sure to frost the bars after they have cooled because they were still very warm when I frosted them.  The frosting melted a little bit but it was still great.

I made this with my own canned pumpkin, substituting applesauce for half of the oil. with the addition of spices, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and ginger.  I also added a half tsp of salt. put it into a 13 x 9 pan which made it a cake but a very good one.  Beautiful soft and delicate, extremely moist, flavorful.  This will go in my 'keep' file.  And for the icing I used an 8 oz cream cheese and a half cup of sugar, and tsp vanilla.  It was perfect.

I made this, but I add a tiny bit more vanilla to the frosting. I also split it by making a dozen cupcakes and then an 8x8 cake.

I've made these many times exactly as written and these are excellent - 5 stars!  Light and fluffy and plain delicious.    UNFORTUNATLEY I read the reviews and tried the 'revised edition' of this recipe.  TERRIBLE. !  I dont understand the raves.  The revised edition is heavy, terribly dense with a  texture of not quite done (baked to doneness) Brownie texture? No not all.  I regret making these and wish I had 2 pans of Paul's for the amount of pumpkin I used.  People who change recipes so much that they make an ENTIRELY different dish need to submit their recipe and see how it stands on its own 2 feet.  Paul's deserves its high rating.  The knockoff I give only 2 stars.   Try Paul's first!

I made these for the Thanksgiving holiday and they were good. I gave it 4 stars because as other reviewers notated. These turned out more like a cake, and not a bar. When I think of a bar I think of a dense(r) texture. Next time I will do what others suggested and will use one less egg. I also may drop the flour by a 1/4 of cup also. The flavor was good, I used cinnamon and nutmeg.

I followed what a few others have done and used 30oz pumpkin and only 3 eggs.  I make these for family get togethers and I never have any leftovers.

I found this recipe a couple years ago and have made it quite a few times, (making it right now too!)  EVERYONE who has had this says it is the best they ever had.  The flavor is delicious and the bars are always perfect!  You cannot go wrong making it!!  I do not use canned pumpkin, I always use fresh sugar pumpkins and just add two cups of fresh pureed pumpkin.  I think it makes a difference.  I add just a touch of fresh ground nutmeg too.  Love! Love! Love!

OMG I got so many compliments for this cake it was ridiculous.
It was finished so fast I don't even have a picture.
I modified it a bit mostly cut down on the sugar , used real pumpkin added chestnuts inside the batter and pecans on the frosting.
I had my 15 minutes of fame today at the office.
Thank you food gods

These came out fantastic!!! I cut the recipe down to 12 servings and they still came out delicious. I followed the videos suggestion and added 1 tsp of Pumpkin Pie spice and loved it! I personally though the frosting would have tasted too sweet so, I made my own lighter version of it. I used 1 cup confections sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp vanilla and a few splashes of milk. I drizzled that on top once the bars cooled and it was perfect for me! Highly recommended!!!!

I made this recipe based on the number of reviews and it turned out great! I also made a few changes. Like some of the other reviewers I used pumpkin pie filling instead of a can of pumpkin. I used unbleached natural sugar instead of white sugar and used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I also added 1 cup of Trader Joe's  semi sweet chocolate chunks. They were delish!

These pumpkin bars were amazing! After reading other reviews I put in a little less than 1c oil (just eyeballed it), and I loaded the batter with spices -- my brood loves extra spice with their pumpkin. Doubled the cinnamon, added cloves, ginger, and fresh ground nutmeg; baked it in a 9x13 baking pan and served it like a sheet cake. (I also made a full recipe of cream cheese frosting with an 8 oz package.) WOW! It was so moist and delicious! I'll be making this one again and again. Tastes like fall! :)

********Update**********  No applesauce?  not a drop in my pantry.  But I had some natural Greek yogurt that needed to be used, so I tossed it in with half the oil.  The slight tartness of yogurt really makes a nice difference.  Extremely moist but more like brownies than cake.  This may have to be a permanent addition to my recipe. ********You wouldn't believe how wonderful my kitchen smells right now!!  This is the second time I made these bars, and they are easy, inexpensive and really delicious.  I live in 'Guatemala and don't have access to canned pumpkin, but right now, various versions of the plants are available in farmer's markets and even some supermarkets.  I have found one that works well for pumpkin bars and pies and muffins and other goodies. I added extra spices to this, including ginger, cloves, allspice and a tiny bit of Chinese Five Spice.  Give this a try, it is a great recipe!

Delicious!! I made it in the 10x15 pan and it was perfect. I  did add ginger, nutmeg, cloves to increase the spice   Also doubled the cream cheese in frosting and subbed applesauce for 2/3  the oil.

I also wanted more of a bar than a cake.  started with 30 oz can of pumpkin, only 3 eggs, and I added 1-t of pumpkin spice.  I also swapped out 1/2 of the oil with apple sauce. and used 8x8 and a 13x9 baking dishes.  For the frosting ,  8 oz cream cheese and doubled the rest of the ingredients.
Fantastic!!!!.....Even better out of the fridge, cold.

Lovely foundation for pumpkin bars/ cake. I loved the recipe and will definitely make it again- next time I will add a bit more spice. Nutmeg and allspice will do nicely. And yes, this recipe works well if you substitute apple sauce for oil.

It's good as written. I like a little more spice so will add more next time. I doubled the icing and it was definitely not too much.

Very moist.  Delicious with or without the frosting.  I followed the recipe as is.  For an optional recipe - I could add 3/4 c pecans or 3/4 mini choc chips.

This was tasty! I made it for a church function and it went over very well. Instead of 15 oz. canned pumpkin I used 2 c. Frozen squash from our garden.  I only had an 11 x 17 jelly roll pan, so I bought a 10 x 15 disposable. Turns out, the 10 x 15 was too small, but the 11 x 17 was exactly right. I will definitely make this again!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I put fresh pumpkin purée into it and don't really measure how much-oops!- and it turns out so yummy. It just takes a bit longer to bake.

Followed directions and measurements exactly just added a little nutmeg but it was amazing!!! All the picky eaters in my house divoured it! I didn't have a jelly pan so I used a 13x9 cake pan and it still came out amazing!!

I made these exactly as written. (I like to make as written first and change if necessary later) They were delicious! I used to make pumpkin bars years ago but had lost my recipe. These were just like the ones I used to make. Maybe a little cakey but yummy none the less. Thanks for a great recipe!

I added good 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 2 & 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp ginger. I used 1 cp applesauce instead of oil and reduced sugar to 1 cp. I did 3 eggs instead of 4 so not so cake like. I smoothed the top leaving it shallower in middle but be careful...top stays just like you smooth it. 
Very good.

This is good just the way it is.  Only change I would make is to add some pumpkin spice seasoning.  It's good even without the frosting. Just serve with ice cream or whipped cream

These were moist and delicious as everyone said. We made them for an alternative dessert at Thanksgiving to the pies and no one could stop eating these. Lots of pie leftover but these disappeared completely. I am making them again for my daughter's birthday because she loved them so much!

I've made this for five years and every year I make changes. But the best change was last year. I added peppermint extract to the frosting. It does not take much because it very strong. So just a little. And be sure to mix well.  Also if you don't cook the bars completely through and then just let them sit over night they will not be so cake like. I take them out when they still stick to a toothpick a little. But if it's still real runny cook them a bit longer.

We loved it.  I have to watch my sugar intake, so I cut the sugar in 1/2 and replaced it with Splenda.  To compensate, I doubled both the baking soda and baking powder.  It worked well. No one suspected it wasn't all "real" sugar.  This was AWESOME and will definitely make it again.

This was absolutely delicious! Tasted just like pumpkin roll! A few changes that I made: 
1. I used pumpkin pie spice in the cake instead of cinnamon.
2. I used 8 oz of cream cheese in the frosting.
3. I added a bit of milk to the frosting to make it more spreadable. 
I made this for a ladies meal and it got rave reviews!

I have made these quite a few times.  Everybody loves them.  The only change I made was I decreased the oil to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.  I couldn't get them to get done in the center.  By decreasing the oil they seem to get done in the middle without compromising the moistness.  Also, I use 4 oz. of cream cheese (just because I halve the 8 oz. pkg.).  So easy to make!

I don't know why the other reviewers felt the need to get away from the cake-like texture, I followed the recipe and my husband, co-workers and I thought they were fantastic!!  The only change was adding 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the dry ingredients.  The frosting amount is just right.
I like a lot of frosting, so I made half again as much and it was perfect.  These are so good, I've made them twice in 4 days. Definitely a keeper!

This is the perfect, feed a crowd option that doesn't include chocolate. I've made this for years at a fundraiser and the organizers keep asking for it again and again. My only change is that I add some limited amounts of traditional pumpkin spices, including cloves, nutmeg and ginger.

Followed the recipe exactly, turned out excellent. I was nervous with all the changes people were making in the reviews, but trust me this recipe is great on its own. It does come out like a pumpkin cake, not like a bar, but it's so  delicious! My husband, who normally hates pumpkin anything, loves it and compares it to carrot cake. Definitely adding this one to my recipe book. Looking forward to bringing this to Thanksgiving for everyone to try! For storage, I put the leftovers in the fridge because of the cream cheese/butter frosting. I plan on trying to freeze this without frosting in the future to see if I can make a big batch and just add frosting as I take them out to eat them, I think it would go well.

Made this and it was DELICIOUS!! My family devoured the bars within a day and a half. I didn't do anything to the original recipe, but, if you love pumpkin and a cake texture, try this! I used a 10x13 inch ceramic pan and the bars turned out to be a little undercooked in the middle. Other than that, it was absolutely amazing. Very easy to bake for newbies.

I followed this recipe and it turned out great, very moist. The only thing I changed was the frosting. I just used plain vanilla frosting as my family doesn't care for cream cheese frosting. I will be making this a lot.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to try for a more bar-like result for today's picnic. I cut out one egg and ½'ed the baking powder and baking soda.

I found the recipe easy to follow and came out exactly as planned.  It was very moist and full of pumpkin flavor.  I doubled the ingredients for the icing and added 2 teaspoons of nutmeg to the icing and it was fantastic.  I highly recommend this.  My two youngest children that normally don't eat pumpkin pie loved this.

2nd time I made this I made the following changes which made for a more moist bar.  Now I've made it 5 times and the recipients can't get enough:
1)  2.5-3 cups of cooked/puree'd butternut squash instead of pumpkin
2)  Sugar: changed to 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 dark brown sugar
3) add 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
4) 3/4 cup oil
Love the frosting too !!!

Yes - it is easy to make. Yes - it is really excellent. I love pumpkin and I love "cake" dessert so this really appealed to me. So I did not hesitate to make this recipe as a cupcake. Read all the reviews carefully and here are the minor changes & I was so confident that I made DOUBLE portions since I had one 29oz can of pumpkin puree: instead of oil I MELTED 1 cup of butter. In addition to the spice listed I also added 1/2 tsp all-spice; 1/2 tsp ginger & 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I can also understand why some cooks added chopped walnuts or pecan nuts as the recipe is so sweet that I did not use cream cheese frosting or icing sugar. Plain delicious on their own! Thank you very much again Deb Martin for sharing this recipe..it is a definite heirloom recipe to keep for all time!

Thank you Deb for this recipe. I used three eggs instead of four. Added Libby's Pumpkin Pie spice mix of 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger and 1/4  teaspoon cloves. This recipe is moist and everyone loved it.

Yummy! Exactly what I was looking for; I'm not a fan of pumpkin recipes that don't use a whole can of pumpkin! I added about a cup of mini chips, because chocolate and pumpkin are like peas and carrots! My jelly roll pan was toast, so I baked them in a 9x13 cake pan, for 35 minutes, and they came out perfectly! For the cream cheese frosting, I whipped together: 8 oz of softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, 1tsp vanilla extract, and 4 cups of powdered sugar. Can't go wrong with extra cream cheese frosting!

I made the following changes to avoid this being too cake like:
I used one less egg, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 30 oz pumpkin puree, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and added 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg

I also used this recipe for the frosting:
8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 3 cups confectioners sugar, 2 tsp vanilla

These were too souffle-like for me.  Other people complained about the same thing.  It might have been that I did not beat them enough the first time.  I'm going to beat them for longer next time and if that doesn't work, reduce the amount of pumpkin by half.

SO GOOD! perfectly moist. I did not change anything on this recipe, except that I added an extra 1/2 cup of powder sugar  for the frosting. 

I made these very last minute for a dinner last night, and it was a success. I will be making these many more times now for the holidays.

I made these for a party right before Thanksgiving.  Following the suggestions of others, I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used only 3 eggs, 1 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup granulated sugar, 1 large can of pumpkin puree (which is about double the amount the recipe calls for) and added 1.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked these in 2 jelly roll pans, so that they'd be a thin bar and not like a cake.   I would probably suggest baking them at a much lower temperature if you do it this way because they got very dark quickly on the bottom or lining the pan with parchment paper first.  If I bake them again, I'd probably bake them around 315 degrees.  For the frosting, I doubled the recipe and used a total of 12 ounces of cream cheese (1.5 boxes).  I did have a little extra frosting left over.  Overall, they were delicious!

These were absolutely delicious and moist! I changed it based on other reviews: 1/2 bs, 1/2 bp, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, 3 eggs. Then I added the spices based on personal preference: 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/4tsp: Cloves, nutmeg, allspice, ginger. I left them out for my husband and he never put them away so they sat out all night uncovered and are still just as moist as when they came out of the oven :)

I couldn't get the frosting to stick without taking the top layer of the bars off. Other than that they are great.

Delicious! I altered the recipe per the reviews as follows: 3 eggs, 30 oz of pumpkin, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (kept the rest of ingredients same). I put in a 13x9 glass pan and baked for 40 mins (until knife came out clean). The icing I used approx. 6 oz cream cheese instead of 3 oz. My husband and 3 y/o loved it:) Thanks for the recipe Deb!

This exact recipe, Pauls Pumpkin Bars, was given to me by my mom at least 25 years ago! I don't know where she originally found the recipe, but I have been baking these for years, no changes needed! In the beginning I didn't have a bar pan and just baked a little longer in a 13x9. Could be a Paula Dean original, I don't know, but it is a timeless classic to me and my family! happy to find it here, it makes it easier to give the recipe to friends who want it!

I've made this twice in the last 2 days. The first time I made it I took the suggestions of several of the reviewers & made the following modifications: 3 eggs instead of 4, cut the baking powder & baking soda in 1/2, added an extra 15oz can of pumpkin, added 1/4 C of brown sugar, added 1 t ginger and 1/2 t cloves, I also only had 1 C of all purpose flour so I had to also use 1 C of bread flour. I didn't care for the consistency of the bars, and it took almost a full hour to cook. The were very rich and I could hardly eat a small square. I also modified the frosting by using a whole 8oz package of cream cheese, 1 3/4 C of butter (only because I didn't have 2 C), 2 t of vanilla, and 4 C of powdered sugar. It was SUPER sweet and I didn't care for it as much.

The second time I made these (today) I stuck pretty much to the recipe exactly except that I did use 1 1/3 C of white sugar and 1/3 C of brown sugar, and I added 1 t of ginger and 1/2 t of cloves. I also now had all purpose flour & used 2 C. These turned out SO MUCH better and only took 30 minutes to cook! I also modified the frosting this time as well & I liked it much better - I used a full 8oz package of cream cheese, 1/2 C butter, 1 t vanilla and about 2-3 C of powdered sugar. It had a stronger cream cheese flavor & I really liked that much better than the super sweet flavor of the last time I made it.

This is a great basic recipe. I added raisins, walnuts and dried cranberries to the batter and substituted half of the oil with a chunky cinnamon applesauce. I also added about 1 tsp of lemon juice to the frosting - this gives it a nice bright flavor.

These pumpkin bars are moist and delicious. Simple recipe to follow. I used aluminum foil, that not only made it easy clean up but kept the moisture in the bars. Highly suggest using this method when making these bars!!

Went with only 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  It's amazing, even without the icing.   Definitely more cake like than bar like.

Cake consistency. Delicious flavor.  I used store-bought icing because we needed dairy free.

I made the following modifications and the end product was a dense cake.  I split the oil with butter (not a huge fan of oil, but love the butter flavor), added about 5 ounces more pumpkin puree, omitted one egg (as suggested) and used 2/3 cup brown sugar in place of white sugar.  The entire family loved this recipe.  I will make again.

I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and used 30 oz pumpkin instead of the 15oz listed. It was too eggy and cakey without the modification.

I have made these so many times I can't count.  I substitute the flour for a Gluten Free flour blend and they still turn out perfectly!  I also have doubled the frosting recipe, because who doesn't love cream cheese frosting!?  AWESOME!

I used brown rice flour(for gluten sensitivity), 1/2 c oil & 1/2c applesauce.  I also only used 1c white sugar & brown sugar for the remaining sugar amount.  They tasted delicious!  I also made my own white frosting instead of cream cheese frosting.

Excellent Moist Cake!!  I love making sheet cakes for a crowd.  I'm a huge fan of cream cheese frosting.  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 3oz.  Everyone loved it.

These are amazing, I had a culinary presentation and everyone loved these the most. The only changes I made was I spread the frosting while they were still warm and it melted over the bars, which made them even better and provided a great texture and "gooeyness" to the bars. I also used a slightly smaller pan which caused the bars to rise a bit more, creating an amazing almost pumpkin bread-like dessert. I love this dessert.

I made 1/2 the amount it calls for since I was baking for a small crowd. I used an 8x8 glass pan & had to leave it in for the same amount of time as directed, maybe a bit longer. The icing on top was a bit sweet for my liking but all in all, this recipe was fantastic! I absolutely love it & it was easy to make.

I have tried this recipe and it is great the way it is. In fact, it is the exact same recipe that Paula Deen uses so you know it's got to be good! I have also tried the variations that were noted in previous reviews and I have to say I like the original recipe better, but that is a personal choice.

Loved them.  Very moist, tender and cakey.  I brought them to work and decorated each piece with candy corn or candy pumpkins and they disappeared quickly.

Very delicious! It almost tastes like carrot cake and is very spongy. Also, the frosting is almost entirely sugar! (I guess all frostings are like that but this was the first time I ever made frosting.) Other than that it is just perfect.

I am so happy!!  I have used this recipe for years from an old community cookbook that was my mother's.  My husband and I bought a "future retirement" farm in rural NC that we go to every weekend.  I wanted to make these pumpkin bars to take to church tomorrow but forgot my cookbook at home.  So surprised to see the same recipe here on All Recipes!!  Thanksgiving blessings to all my fellow  bakers!

Really easy and delicious! It seemed like it might be tastier with the addition of pumpkin pie spice or cloves, etc. Otherwise, a winner!

I always put more pumpkin in the mix, makes for a less 'cakey' texture.

I found this exact recipe of "Paul's Pumpkin Bars" in the Parade section of the Sunday newspaper when my kids were in high school.  (They are in their 40's now.)  It has never failed to be a big hit.  When I had access to fresh pumpkins, I would cook them, grind the pulp and strain it for use in this recipe.  Of all the pumpkin bars I have tasted, this recipe makes the lightest and most moist bars ever.

Amazing. I have made it twice Yummy. The only change I made was the spice level. I added an autumn spice blend, two TBSP, other than that, awesome.

These are very tasty!  I also added 1/2 cup of applesauce and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I used a 9 x 13 pan. I had some extra batter so I used a muffin pan.  It took about 28 to 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  For the frosting, I used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 1/3 cup of butter and added a dash of cinnamon. I could eat the frosting all day!

I followed the exact recipe except I put it in a 13x9 pan accidentally. It was light, fluffy and the spice did not overwhelm the pumpkin flavor. The icing is yummy and just the right amount. I am sure all the changes are good too but this recipe is great just like it is!

Loved this recipe! I usually buy the prepackaged mixes of anything but thought I would try to bake something from scratch. Not only was it very easy but better then any prepackaged mix I've ever bought! I just put powdered sugar instead of frosting.

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to the pumpkin bars my mom used to make. This recipe gave me the basics then I added 1 cup of chopped pecans and 1 cup of coconut, now it's just like the ones mom used to make.

Absolutely delicious. Sometimes takes a little longer to cook all the way through. I used homemade pumpkin puree from my Halloween pumpkin. I don't even bother with the Icing. Just dust with powdered sugar before serving. My son eats this for breakfast lunch and dinner.  And my boss placed a special request for it today.

These pumpkin bars were so good.  I made some alterations based upon other reviews.  I only used 3 eggs.  I was going to use two 15 oz cans of pumpkin because of other reviews but only had one, and it turned out great.  I used 1 cup of sugar.  And I used cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and nutmeg (I never measure those spices, always just put in a good helping.)  And the big difference was I added chocolate chips, mixed them in at the end with my electric mixer.  Also only used about 1 1/2 c confectioner's sugar in frosting. These bars were amazing, would definitely recommend.

After reading reviews,  I reduced egg to 3 so these would be more like bars. Everyone raved. I decorated the tops after frosting with 3 variations: plain,  mini chocolate chips,  and pecan pieces.I think this went better than adding anything to the batter when making for a large group.

Loved these.  Reminds me of carrot cake with the cream cheese frosting.  I didn't have a full cup of oil so only used 3/4 cup and I also have high blood pressure so I only used 1/4 tsp salt and they were still moist and delicious.

I didn't love these, but they were OK.  I took the advice of others and used only 3 eggs.  I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and the oil to 3/4 cup.  And I only used 1 tsp baking power and 1/2 tsp baking soda plus 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  All that was fine and the bars/cake tasted OK, but I didn't care for the frosting.  It was salty, which can be fixed by using unsalted butter.  But something was just off in the overall flavor.

I wanted to use fresh pumpkin, not canned, and they were wonderful. I decreased the eggs to 3 and added 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to the batter. (In addition to the 2 tsp. cinnamon recommended  - pumpkin pie spice just seems to add more depth of flavors). 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin worked very well. To half the fat I only used 1/2 cup oil (light olive) and 1/2 cup applesauce. I've made these three times this week with this frosting: Rich Cream Cheese Frosting (with less Butter): 1/4 cup butter, 8 oz. cream cheese, 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 cups powdered sugar, dash of milk if needed. (I only needed half this frosting for our lightly frosted pan of bars). Wonderful.

I made this cake for a last minute recipe for a Halloween party tommorrow. It has a lot of pros but one very important con to it. I thought the cake tasted so strongly of vegetable "oil." I liked that it all fits in a large jelly roll pan, it rises up nicely, it does not stick, and it makes a descent looking cake. The frosting, even being short about 1 of cream cheese, turned out very well. I will taste it tommorrow with the icing and change my review based on that. As is, just hope the cake will taste differently after it sits. I would hate to have to figure out something different to have to bring tommorrow.

AMAZEBALLS!!!! I made these for today's Thanksgiving (I'm Canadian) and they turned out AMAZING!!!! Super moist and just so yummy! They were a hit with everyone! Even the ones that don't even LIKE pumpkin! I did tweak it a bit per other suggestions whereas instead of the puree I used pie filling, and halved the baking soda and baking powder... The only other thing I did differently was add  1/2 tsp of nutmeg.

Excellent!  I used 1 3/4 cup of fresh pumpkin (the equivalent of a 15oz can) and it was delicious!  Our guests loved it, including the children.  Will definitely use this again.

Absolutely fantastic.  I made these for my family and they were gone the same night.  Frosting was good and had just the right amount of cream cheese.  I will be making these again.

This recipe was amazingly good! My husband and kids loved it too. I cut all ingredients in half and baked it for 25 mins in an 8X8 cake pan so that my family of 4 could enjoy it for dessert and not have tons left over. I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of cloves for the full pumpkin spice cake flavoring. I will keep this as one of my favorite fall dessert recipes!

This is definitely "pumpkin cake" and very delicious! I used a 9 x 13 cake pan.  I used three eggs instead of four, added a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, and about 3/4 of a 30 oz can of Libby's pumpkin. It was the magic formula! Definitely double the cream cheese in the frosting to maximize the awesomeness of this recipe. Everyone is happy in my house tonight.

I know that other reviewers said these were more like a cake than a bar - they weren't kidding. I made this exactly as stated. This is a thin cake that in my opinion, is lacking in flavor. More spices and more pumpkin would fix that I'm sure, but I rather make my favorite pumpkin bread recipe and save the calories (frosting). Don't get me wrong, I made this today, and keep going back and eating more - it's not BAD. Just not a bar as the recipe title suggest and not worth making again for me.

I made my own pumpkin puree for this recipe, followed it to a T, but it came out tasting way too oily. Will modify next time by adding 1/2 apple sauce, 1/2 oil, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 regular sugar, and lots more pureed pumpkin and spices. Otherwise the taste is great and the cake came out pretty moist.

These are absolutely delicious. However, I used less sugar and since I didn't have veg oil on hand, used safflower oil and about 1/8 of grapeseed oil. I also added ground cloves, a pinch or two of ground ginger, and extra cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp of cardamon. Since I omitted the frosting, I put a little of the vanilla extract into the batter. I also added a tad of almond extract flavor as. Mmmm. And, lastly, upon taking another's advice, I threw in a bit of semi-sweet chocolate chips (mini and regular size for variety)! Excuse me for bragging, but with little adjustments this turned out ah-ma-zing! Thanks so much for the terrific base recipe - it's now my mother's "newest favorite dessert" she told me over the holidays. It baking up a batch for her now, on Christmas morning, to give to her later on today. :D

I can't tell you how amazing these turned out! I made these for a post-Thanksgiving dinner with my roommates and everyone absolutely loved them, including me. They're perfect; not too rich and not too sweet. The contrast of the tangy cream cheese frosting with sweet pumpkin flavor is a perfect balance. I followed the recipe exactly and I suggest everyone do the same. I guess you could change it up if you want a less cakey texture, but I liked it the way it is because it's light and fluffy.

To be honest, I didn't make this as written. I wanted to cut back on the oil, and had planned on using applesauce, but I didn't have any on hand. I had heard that you could replace flax seed meal for part of the oil, so I tried that. I used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup flax seed meal for my oil. I also used 1 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup white. For the spices, I added 1/4 tsp each ground Ginger, Cloves and Nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. I baked it in a jelly roll pan. For the cream cheese icing I used 8 oz. cream cheese and approximately 4 cups powdered sugar. I'm very pleased with the results. I may add more of the 3 extra spices, and I'm wondering what some mashed banana would taste like in it. Maybe a little bit of orange zest as well. Hmmmm...

These were too "cakey" for me too, so I also cut the eggs down to three and used 30 ounces of pumpkin. I also used a maple cream cheese frosting for these, by using 4oz of cream cheese, 1/2 a cup of butter, 2 teaspoons of vanilla, three cups of confectioners sugar, and a tablespoon of maple syrup. It was just enough to make it a breakfast bar, but just sweet enough to snack on throughout the day! So good :)

I tried this because I had extra pumpkin and frosting from previous recipe. Brought most of them to work. Got rave reviews

Everyone LOVES this cake! Instead of making it in a 9x13 pan I do 2 round pans and make a layer cake. It is so moist & flavorful! I get many requests for this cake and it never fails to please. I changed only two things about the recipe. I threw in a tsp. of pumpkin pie spices along with the cinnamon and I also added a few tbsps of milk to the icing. Other than that it's awesome!!

I just made these and even with taking an egg out and using half the baking powder they are still a lot like cake. With that being said, the taste is wonderful and they smell great. I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice and a drop of maple extract to the frosting. I would only warn that if you are looking for a bar this is not your recipe as this is more cake like.

Absolutely fabulous ! :-) I also add just 1/4 tsp each of ground nutmeg and ground cloves...otherwise, everything is the same...other than I do sprinkle chopped walnuts on top of the frosting to 1/2 of the pan, because not all people like nuts or are allergic to them. And I always make it the day before I need to take it to any gathering, because it gets more moist as it sits, probably because of the oil in the bars and the frosting on top...it is just sooooooooooo gooooood...thanks, Paul !!! :-)

This was a great recipe! Truly tasted of fall! I thought the frosting was a bit runny, should have added a bit more powdered sugar. Otherwise, I made this recipe exactly as written and I was SO pleased with how it turned out!

This recipe, as written, is nothing more than a pumpkin sheet cake with cream cheese frosting.  I wouldn't call it pumpkin "bars".  Having said that, I have made it 2 times in the last 2 weeks because it is moist, delicious, and pretty much a no-fail recipe.  I am anxious to try a few modifications suggested by other members, i.e., less eggs, more pumpkin, more spices or even the chocolate chips!

These are delicious and moist. I replaced half of the oil with applesauce to cut back on fat. I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. They're so good they don't even need frosting!

The first time I make this, I followed the recipe to a T (except I used 1 3/4 c. fresh pumkpin instead of canned). They were yummy, but a little greasy. I just made them again and this time I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce. I also used 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. Super yummy, we don't even make the frosting, they are sweet enough!

Fantastic! Very easy, moist and delicious.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan...topped with whipped cream rather than icing.  It was a huge hit!

I didn't have the correct sized pan so I used the handy tool of changing the portions. I used 1 1/2 of the ingredients and it turned out very well. I tried a recipe similar to this that you have to roll up etc... and I wasn't able to do it correctly. This recipe tastes just as great but it's much easier. This is a recipe I will definitely use a lot in the Fall.

I thought this was a good recipe but I made a lot of changes. I made a sweet potato casarole (a 20 oz can of baked sweet potatoes, 2 Tbsps butter, cinnamon and nutmeg with a little sugar) and it was not a hit at the dinner table. So I substituted it for the can of pumpkin in this recipe and baked the batter in a bundt pan. (took about 45 min) Turned out really good. I did not do any frosting but in the future I might add some chopped nuts to it. Suffice it to say, sweet potato is a good substitute for pumpkin if you're thinking about changing it up.

I made this twice and enjoyed it thoroughly both times.  Both times I put it in a 9x13 afraid that the jelly roll pan would be to small.  The texture of this is more of a cake then a bar.  I don't think that using a jelly roll pan would change the texture to much.  The cream cheese frosting I made as is, then I tasted it and decided to add the rest of the cream cheese for a total of 8oz as well as some extra vanilla (yum).  The frosting was delicious!!  For experimental purposes I would try using applesauce instead of the oil and in lieu of all white flour I would try using whole wheat flour.  Thank you for the recipe, it is very tasty.

I baked these for my boyfriends family and his mother said they were "melt in your mouth" good. I subbed Splenda, egg beaters, and margarine; the outcome was just as good as the "traditional" way of making them. Such a good recipe.

If you're using a 12 1/2 by 17 1/2 jellyroll pan try increasing the oven temp to 365 degrees and reducing the cooking time to about 18 minutes. Still keep an eye on them though to make sure they don't burn.

The humble pumpkin "bar" that exceeded my expectations! Yum! I mean YUM! YUM! YUM!
I followed the recipe but baked in a 9x13 (I wanted some volume!). I also frosted my bars when they were still warm so that the frosting would melt down into them a little bit. I waited to cut them until they were cool. WOW. These are so moist, fluffy, and delicious.

UPDATE: MY NEIGHBORS LOVED THESE!!! BECAUSE THIS MAKES SUCH A LARGE BATCH, I ALSO GAVE ANOTHER NEIGHBOR A FEW BARS TO TRY. SHE ALSO RAVED AND NOW WANTS THE RECIPE! :) Yum! Fall is just around the corner and you know what that means.... Fall baking time is heeeere!!! My neighbors gave my hubs and I a heaping plate of chicken Parmesan recently. While searching for a thoughtful way to thank them, I stumbled upon this recipe. I'm SOOOO glad I found this gem! These bars are absolutely fantastic - SUPER moist with a homemade frosting that is just sweet enough to enhance (not compete) with them. Although I'm sure these would be great as is, I did make a couple of substitutions. Instead of cinnamon, I used pumpkin pie spice (I use this spice in ALL of my fall baked goodies). My final change was to substitute vanilla flavored baking oil for regular vegetable oil (I purchased this at a local specialty shop that sells flavored oils and vinegar). Other than these two minor deviations, I followed this recipe to a T. Topping each bar with a marshmallow creme pumpkin made these seasonally appropriate (and adorable!)! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Deb. I'm going to make these a LOT in the next couple months! :-)

I absolutely loved this recipe. 4 stars because it was more of a cake than a bar but fantastic tasting non the less. I had to alter the recipe, used brown sugar instead of white. When I went to make this I found that I didn't have any white sugar. The family drooled about the smell the entire time I baked and cooled it.

We liked it a lot.  It is definitely a cake as opposed to a bar, but that was fine.  Taste was great.  Icing makes the cake extra good.

I used 3 eggs and a tad bit more cinnamon, and they turned out great.  Delicious even without the frosting, which I haven't added yet.

YUMMMY! It's definitely more a pumpkin cake but SO cook!! I didn't change the recipe, made as is, and it was delicious! I did however not make the frosting and added chocolate chips to the batter. I took it to a church function and it was eaten in minutes and several people asked for the recipe.

I got this recipe from a neighbor 25 years ago.  They have always been a big hit when I take them anywhere.  I usually put a cream cheese icing on top which puts it "over the top."

Very yummy and fluffy.  Added 1 tsp pumpkin spice.  Used 3 eggs.  Double the pumpkin puree.  1 cup of sugar.  Instead of vegetable oil I used walnut oil.  For the frosting 1/2 cup of powdered sugar.  It's more of a pumpkin cake.

These are good regardless of the "cake like" texture. Instead of just dolloping the cream cheese icing on top, I spread a layer of it on it. Very yummy.

This recipe would make fabulous mini pumpkin muffins. I threw in some semi sweet choc morsels and didn't use a frosting. These were wonderful.

When enough people say they used the modified version, I usually go for it.  So glad I did, I added the 30oz of Libby's Pumpkin Pie filling and it was definitely the "moist maker." I didn't have the pumpkin pie spice, and I think it could have used a little "umph" in taste but stilll really good. I wasn't too pleased with the icing recipe because it initally came out runny and thin.  Once I put everything back into the fridge (we love chilled desserts) the icing congealed and had a great flavor.  Will definitely be making this a staple!

I make this several times in autumn.  It is a cake that is baked in a 10x13 then cut into squares. It's great to have a recipe that feeds many. In my opinion, doesn't need any adjustments. Sometimes I just use a white icing, but to make it fancy, decorate the squares with chopped walnuts or a candy corn. FUTURE Note: May try others' 'brownie' suggestions to omit an egg, 1/2'd baking soda and powder, and use 29 oz. pumpkin can.

These are awesome.  Made these a bunch of times I half the recipe and cook in a 9x13. I made a oops the other day and bought Pumkin Mix and after reading a few reviews on mix I thought I could switch it out with the pumpkin just need to watch the seasoning. NO didn't work. These turned out like a cooked custard. Kinda like a crustless  pumpkin pie. It was odd. Anyway my only bit of wisdom I am passing on. So mad at myself cause these are just so yummy.

The only changes I made to this recipe were using 3 eggs instead of 4, using 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white, and using pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon. I left the frosting entirely as it was - some reviewers doubled the recipe but I think that would make way too much. The bars were good aside from having very little pumpkin flavor. I think next time I will add more pumpkin and replace half of the oil with apple sauce, to try to get them more pumpkin-tasting.

I'm really disappointed with this recipe. The flavor is pretty good, but the finished product is a cake, not what I call a bar at all. I will not make these again.

These are the best pumpkin bars ever!  You just need to make sure that you cook them enough, as the center can sometimes be a little under baked.

Wonderful- everyone loved this recipe. I used 8oz of cream cheese and doubled the rest of the icing ingredients except for the butter (only used 1.5 sticks). I had leftover icing but I don't think the regular amount would have been enough. I would definitely make again!

This is a great recipe. It is like a cake which is what I was looking for.  Instead of the cinnamon I used 3 1/2 tsp of Pumpkin pie spice.  I also used 1/2C Applesauce and 1/2C Oil.  I tried 1 1/2C white flour and 1/2C whole wheat and it tasted great. I topped with Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.

We all love these bars.   I too changed a few things.  1/2 the oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce keeps these very moist.  I also add pumpkin spices. I drizzle the cream cheese frosting instead of coating the whole cake.  This helps with the fat content and it doesn't over take the flavor of the bars. They are so easy to make and delicious.

This is an AMAZING recipe! Excellent flavor, very moist, just perfect! In order to reduce fat and sugar I made the following changes: I only used 1 1/4 cup of sugar, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of oil + 1/2 cup apple sauce and reduced the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. On the cream cheese topping I used fat free cream cheese, 1/4 of butter and reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. Thanks Deb this is definitely a keeper!

These are really similar to Paula Dean's from Food Network and are the best!  Brought to a cocktail party last night as a dessert - didn't make the frosting but sprinkled with powdered sugar.   People e-mailed me this morning for the recipe.  I added 1/8 t cloves and 1/4 t nutmeg.  Not too sweet, great flavors!

A Neighborhood Hit. We added a hint Pumpkin spice as well as increased the pumpkin puree to two cans rather than one. The frosting was good but using 8 oz of cream cheese was better for our taste. Thanks!!

I liked the basic recipe behind this, but I did have to make a few modifications, so that's why I'm giving this a 4 out of 5. You can definitely cut back on the sugar and oil (I cut the sugar to 1 C, half brown & half white, and the oil to 2/3 C). I added double the pumpkin, and substituted wheat flour for all-purpose. I also added 1 tsp ground ginger , 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to help enhance the flavor.   Obviously my changes made the bars different from the original recipe, but judging from how mine turned out (they were wonderfully moist, had just enough sweetness, and were very happily devoured!) I believe the non-modified version would have been good, if perhaps a little sweet and greasy. Thanks for a nice autumn recipe!

I added a little more cinnamon- but I agree with others in that this is more of a cake than a bar- maybe cut down on the baking powder

I have used this recipe for years and it is the best!  SO easy and turns out perfect every time.  I add a dash of ginger to the batter and I do use 4 oz ouf cream cheese in the frosting along with adding another 1/2 t. of vanilla as well.  Last year I made a very time consuming pumpkin cheese cake and every was disappointed I didn't bring these bars.  The cheese cake was okay but the bars are yummy!

Excellent, just as I remember them from growing up.  Moist, fluffy and wonderful! They are more of a "cake" but it is the "title" I used when searching for the ones I remembered from childhood. I made exactly as directed except subbed 1 3/4 cup pureed pie pumpkin for 15 oz can. Also, baked in 9x13 for almost 45 minutes.  Yummy!  I might spread out the batter between two pans for a "smaller bar"

I'm so glad you didn't alter the name of this recipe, it helps those of us looking for old favorite recipes (that we've misplaced) online.  (FYI - I first found this recipe published in the November 1976 BHG magazine and then again in March of 1986.)  It has been a favorite in our family and loved by everyone, everywhere I've served it.  The name is decieving, it is more like a thin sheetcake rather than like a bar cookie and was noted as such in the magazine.  I do add ginger and cloves to it just to spice it up to my taste, but it's great as written too. It's a perfect fall dessert!

I too followed the previous suggestions and ommitted an egg. It took forever to cook and it seemed like it wasn't completely done in the middle after 45 minutes.  However, when I took it out and slathered it with cream cheese frosting which was delicious, it proved to be more promising! Everyone loved it and I brought it to work and the guys demanded I make it again!

I used mashed sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin and added some chocolate chips. The rest of the recipe was the same, with the exception of a dash of both nutmeg and allspice, along with the cinnamon. Delicious!! The texture was perfect. I also added a thin layer of chocolate frosting instead of the cream cheese. It was sweet and moist, but not over the top.

I baked this using an 11X7 pan and a square baking dish as I didn't have a jelly roll pan OR a 13X9 available.  The bars were more cake-like than what the recipe probably intended, but very good.  I added about 1/2 tsp allspice in addition to the cinnamon.

Nuuuumy!  I want to eat the whole thing by myself!  I used a lrg can of pumpkin (29 oz.) and used 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1.5 tsp. pumpkin spice, 3 eggs, cut the sugar down to 1C, and kept the other ingredients the same, and put in my regular cake pan.  It baked for about 35 minutes in my oven. I didn't have any cream cheese for the frosting, so just used 1/4 container of regular pre-made betty crocker vanilla frosting... you could add orange food coloring for the pumpkiny look...  I applied it to the bars while it was still hot, so it melted into a thin glaze.  Perfect!  My husband couldn't wait till it cooled, so he ate it warm, he ended up eating 4 bars!!!

These bars were fantastic! I followed the advise of others and used 2 cans of pumpkin and added about 1 tsp of pumpkin spice. I didn't realize that I was almost out of the oil so only used 1/2 cup oil and added 1/2 cup applesauce. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup because of the applesauce. I baked them in 2 9 x 13 pans. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe from the pumpkin bars II recipe from this site and they tasted great. I got a lot of compliments on them.

They came out perfect and everyone who tasted them loved them. I also tried tips from other members and tried to make them more bar like by puting less eggs and adding another 15 oz can of pumpkin puree and they still came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe I have been looking for a recipe for pumpkin bars for a long time.

I increased the amount of pumpkin, used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of Cinnamon, and used a 9x13 pan.  It was a nice pumpkin cake.  I will add more Pumpkin Pie Spice next time.

I made this at Thanksgiving as a bundt cake - thinned the cream cheese glaze with a little extra milk and poured it on - looked like it was snow-covered! Not only did it look great, it tasted great.  Am making again for Christmas.  Thanks Paul!

These are a favorite in my family!  I did make a couple of changes.  I added 1 tsp. of Pumpkin Pie Spice to the dry ingredients and sprinkled chopped walnuts over the icing.  Everyone will be asking you for the recipe!

I have made this several times and the recipe  consistantly turns out well.  They pumplin bars look nice, too! For ease, I use canned cream cheese frosting.

Great recipe!  I used one less egg, and half the baking soda and powder to make them more like a bar cookie.  I added nutmeg and a little allspice to the batter, and added pumpkin pie spice to the icing.  They were phenomenal!

I followed the recipe and tried the modified versions of other reviews. My family prefers the cakey original version - I even put it all in one 9x13 pan. I do add more spice to suit our taste. But we love it and make it every fall.

This recipe is great.
The only thing that I did differently was use more cream cheese.  I actually did it by accident because I purchased the wrong size cream cheese bar.  It turned out wonderful.
I took it to work and everyone loved it.

I used 2c. fresh pumpkin puree I made, and since it was fresh, and typically more liquidy than canned, I used only 1/2c. oil. I used pumpkin pie spice rather than spices listed, and as other reviews recommended, used only 3 eggs and halved my baking powder/soda. I'm using betty crocker cream cheese frosting, and letting guests frost themselves--as I think chocolate may also work well (I liked it this way). In jelly roll pan, it's a dark non-stick, so I did take it out at 27 min (magic time I guess), and it tastes so moist (I assume because I used fresh pumpkin, as all my recipes with fresh pumpkin do this).

I thought these were very cakey but also very tasty.  I used some cream cheese frosting that I had leftover from frosting some cookies and it worked great!  So I only made the cake not the frosting.

This is a great recipe. I cut down about a 1/4 C on the oil and used a 30 oz can of pumpkin and they were moist and perfect.
The frosting was not good, way too much butter. I would cut that in half.

This is a great recipe, however like previous reviewers I only used 3 eggs and cut back on baking powder to 1 tsp. It fit perfectly in jelly roll pan and came out very moist. Awesome! I also doubled frosting using 8 oz cream cheese. I will definately use recipe again next time adding raisins.

This recipe was SO good! The only thing I did differently was substitute oil for applesauce. This is something I do in everything I make that calls for oil. The pumpkin bars were just perfect. Served them warm with vanilla ice cream and it was a big hit.

This recipe is fool proof.  Even with adjustments it turned out great.  I substituted half of the oil w/applesauce and replace 2/3 c white sugar with brown sugar.  They were moist and tender.  Substituted maple extract for vanilla (b/c I was out) and topped with toasted walnuts.  My co-workers devoured them!

These were excellent!  I myself, unlike many of the other reviewers here, was looking for something more "cake" like.  Here's the small changes I made: I added 1 t. pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 t. nutmeg to the "cake mix".  I used a standard cake pan and baked for 35 minutes.  For the frosting I used 8 oz. cream cheese and 2 t. vanilla, I kept the powdered sugar at 2 c.  It turned out wonderful!  Both my husband and I couldn't get enough of it!  A wonderful "autumn cake"!  Yum!

I made these exactly as written...which is a switch for me!  I'll admit that they do have more of a cake-like texture than a bar (?), but I'm willing to forgive that because they taste very good!  I'm not a big frosting fan, but my family is.  I think I'll look for a different frosting.  This one was ok, but not the greatest.  Thanks!

This recipe was great!  More of a cake though than a firm bar.  The only thing I added was some Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Everyone was crazy about them - saying that they were even better than the awesome carrot cake next too it.  Great for special occasions, but if I were to make for home, I will try to lighten it up - lots of fat and calories as is.

Super and easy and quick.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  Everyone in my house loved them.  Thanks.

The only thing I changed in this was using applesauce instead of the oil. I would call it more of a cake than a bar, but this is by far the softest moistest cake I have ever had. My family ate it up in 2 days.

I have made this recipe several times and always love them. My family gobbles them right down, anytime of year. I do double the frosting recipe as I like lots of cream cheese frosting. The rest of the recipe I follow to a tee!

I have been making these since they first appeared in Better Homes & Gardens magazine 25 or 30 years ago.  I like the fact that they are easy to make, and everyone likes them.  However, some people go absolutely crazy over them!!

A good recipe, but as reviewers have already said, this is not a bar recipe, but rather a cake.  The taste is good, but not amazing.

Good.  Wanting more a bar rather than a cake, I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted one egg and halved the baking powder and baking soda.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of cloves and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  The end result was good but not what I would consider a "bar."  Fiance said this reminded him of an unrolled pumpkin roll, and I agree.

If you're looking to make actual "bars" don't use this recipe.  If you want to make an incredibly delicious pumpkin cake, you'd be crazy not to try it - it's sooooo good! 

The second time around I halved the recipe, then added some nutmeg and ginger. I also didn't make as much icing as it called for  bc I thought it was a tad too sweet with the original amount.

I made it as suggested with one less egg and half the baking powder and baking soda... It turned out really good, really yummy. I also added about 4 teaspoons of lemon juice to the frosting. I think it cuts down on the sweetness a bit.

For some reason these pumpkins bars just didnt do it for me. They didnt have enough pumpkin flavor and for whatever reason i thought they were a bit dry. I made them as written but did have to add some extra spices and i am so glad i did because otherwise they would have been way too bland. I was really hoping these would be super dense and really pumpkiny. 
Thanks anyway for the recipe!!
UPDATE: These were way better the next day- for that reason i am going to up my rating to 4 stars!!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  Wow. I did 3 eggs instead of 4 (like other posters had mentioned) and added dashes of nutmeg and cloves to the mix.

I made it in a cake pan and also cupcakes.  I could see chocolate chips or raisins going really well in this recipe also.  I might try that next time.

These bars are fabulous! They are very simple to make, don't have a long list of ingredients, and are not too sweet.  I substituted splenda for the sugar and added 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice thanks to previous reviews, but other than that it was great as is. My husband keeps going back to the pan to "even out" the row! Yum, yum, yum!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed others suggestions and cut down to only 3 eggs and added 1 1/2 t. vanilla and used the cream cheese frosting recipe on the web site.  My husband said that these were the best bars that I have made in a long while.  Definate keeper!!!

From reading the other reviews, I knew that this would be more of a "cake" and not a bar, so I really wasn't disappointed. However, I really think that the cream cheese frosting makes this cake! It was really delicious! I would definitely recommend making the frosting to go along with these.

Wow.  These are perfect.  Definitely bake until a toothpick comes out clean, otherwise the middle will be gooey.  Some people like that though:)  The cream cheese frosting is WAY better than pre-made.

I've made these several times now and we just love them. I follow the recipe but also add a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I suggest not doubling the frosting, the amount given is more than enough! Thanks :)

mmmm...these were delicious!!  they were gone in seconds at our thanksgiving feast!  (the kiddos loved them too).  I did make a few changes based on others comments.  I added quite a bit more spice (and i'm glad i did).  i added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  1/4 tsp. ground cloves 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and few dashes of all spice.  I also did about 6oz. of cream cheese and added a few dashes of cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture.  After i baked and cooled - i then cut into squares - and iced individually.  (this way you get a good ammount of icing on each one).  mmm..it is "cakey" but soooo moist and sooo good!

Just ok.  Made according to directions, only in a cake pan.  Cake (bars) was too moist and not enough frosting.  As others have suggested, make more frosting or use another frosting recipe and cut an egg out.

Wonderful recipe!  I usually hate when people change the recipes, but I confess to having done that here per Circekitty's modifications, and I think she was dead on (thank you Circekitty!!!).  Subtract an egg, use 30 oz. pumpkin pie mix instead of the 15 oz. puree.  Add 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to the cinnamon.  Perfect.  I also omitted the frosting here and used Cream Cheese Frosting II from the site.  And I agree with others that this is more on the cake-y side, but that's fine with me;  this will be our new go-to family birthday cake.  Love it!!

These were great, I made them following the advise of using 3 eggs for the bars and 8 oz. cream cheese and 3 cups sugar for the frosting. They didn't last long, shared them with some friends & they couldn't get enough of them

I loved this recipe.  I would have added more spice to it but it was still delicious.  I wouldn't really consider it a bar though.  It was more of a cake.

Followed the bar recipe to the letter but doubled the frosting (only because my family loves cream cheese frosting - but it wouldn't need it).  Everyone LOVED them.  Will definitely make these again, and agian!

I made this recipe with the extra pumpkin and 1 less egg... it was a little thick for my liking (although still quite yummy). Next time I'll make the original recipe.

This is the exact same recipe that my mother made! I think she found it out of a book, though. I'm not sure. Anyways, very tasty recipe, people love these! I'm taking them to yet another social event this fall!

Loved this recipe! My first time making them, but not my first time eating them.  I loved them, as well as people who had never heard of pumpkin bars!  I did take a couple tips from other reviewers and they turned out great! I think next time I will put them in a jelly roll pan bigger than 10x15 to get more of a bar height.

These are very good Paul, thank you for sharing.  I didn't rate it a 5 because the frosting recipe.  I need more frosting than that, so used the recipe from Frosted Banana bars difference is you use the whole cream cheese & 4 cups powdered sugar.  This really does make them wonderful!
Thanks!

This was definitely a bar for me-not cakey/crumbly as others had described.  It was somewhat creamy like pumpkin pie but firmer.  I don't know what it was that I did, but I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe I didn't bake it long enough in my oven.  But either way, my coworkers really enjoyed this.  I liked it too, but it would've been bland without the cream cheese frosting.  I would make this again with the addition of extra spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.

I had a problem with not cooking them long enough.  I thought they were done, spring back on top, had baked 30 mins, etc, but when they cooled, the middle fell and then I found out the middle was not done and acted more like pumpkin pie.  The flavor was very good and so is the frosting.  I added ground clover and nutmeg to mine for a bit of spice (1/2 tsp of each).  I will probably add more spice and cook at least five minutes more next time.  Very cake-like, not bar like, but exactly what I was looking for.

Delicious and so easy.  These remind me of a recipe my Aunt used to make while I was growing up.  Loved 'em then, and was so excited to find this recipe now.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla & a dash or two of cloves & nutmeg.  I will probably double the frosting like other reviewers suggested next time.  Thanks!!  This is going in my recipe file.

Excellent flavor, but along with everyone else, they were a bit "cakey".  My solution was simple:  I just baked them on a cookie sheet, so they were flatter and fed a few more people.  It was a hit at the Badger tailgate perty last weekend!

I have made the recipe a few times and loved it every time. However, it is much more like a cake, i'm actually not sure why it is called a bar. I started making it in a layer cake because it seems to fit much better. truly delicious!!

This was just okay to us. I was looking for a moist pumpkin bar and this was more of a cake texture. Without the icing, it would have been a 2.

Yes this is more cakey than a bar. I also decreased the egg by one, and used half apple sauce and half oil. I like it very much. I will try and omit all the oil and use all apple sauce next time, may even omit one more egg. Also needs more spice.

This was a great recipe!  Everyone here thought it was delish.  It is definitely more cakey which is great but if you want something in a bar form then this recipe isnt for you.  I used a sheet pan and I was lazy so I used a can of cream cheese frosting instead of making the actual frosting.  Next time though I definitely want to try the real frosting!  THANKS!!!

I thought they were good, but I thought they were to cakey. I also felt that they needed more spice than just cinnamon.

These were good, frosting made the recipe.  Bars are bland without it.  Might add a little (1-2 tsp) McCormick pumpkin pie spice to give it a little more flavor.

Very easy to make.  I would add a little more spice.  I instead added extra cinnamon to the frosting which was the perfect amount.

I definitely give this recipe 5 stars!!  These are perfect and use ingredients that I always have on hand (a definite plus).  This a simple, straight forward recipe that will be used for many, many years to come!  Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was just right.  Nice pumpkin flavor with just a bit of spice.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is okay. Instead of 4 eggs I only used 2. I only used 1/2 c. of oil instead of 1 c. They still came out very moist. Added 1 tsp. all spice in place of 1 tsp. cinnamon. Next time I will add another tsp. all spice to make them spicy.

Thanks Paul...these bars ROCK! I used 2/3 cup oil, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I would suggest using more cream cheese and butter to make more frosting. The recipe as written is just a bit shy.

I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and I might add a little all spice next time; I thought they could have used just a tad more flavor. They were otherwise good, and everyone else loved them (they were gone in less than half an hour). I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderfully moist. I would also consider this a cake, but cut into small squares it's great for a potluck. I substituted pumpkin pie spice for cinnamon and used 4 oz (1/2 a block) of cream cheese for frosting.

WOW!  These were great!  I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin rather than the canned.  I also like mine with a little more flavor, so I added 2 tsp. all spice.  I will be making this one again SOON.

I thought I would be thrilled with these bars, but they were just OK.  They weren's as moist as I expected them to be from all the reviews, and they could have used a little more spice.  I prefer a denser bar, these are more like cake like the others wrote, but even for a cake-like bar they weren't that great.  Oh, for the frosting I used some plain cream cheese and then a 3-oz container of Brown Sugar and Cinnamon cream cheese swirl and it added a really good maple-type flavor to the frosting.

Love this, but it's cake not bars.  Increase the spices for more flavor, if you like.  I use Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site to top.

YUM!  Make sure to put this in a HUGE pan, not a regular cake pan as it does bake up to almost a cake like size.  We used a can of white chocolate/almond frosting because we forgot to buy cream cheese and it turned out very good.

This was like carrot cake without the carrots.  A very moist cake.  There is too much batter for a 9x13 pan (takes too long to cook through), so we'll try it again with reduced ingredients amoungs.

This is a delicious, easy recipe.  However, to make it a little healthier, I cut back the oil to 3/4c. and the sugar to 1 1/3c.  Enjoy!

This is awesome.  I'd had this recipe for a long time, butI hadn't made it because my Mom said the ingredients didn't make sense on my card.  However, I decided to try it for Thanksgiving.  Sure enough the baking soda and powder amounts were incorrect.  So I did a search on allrecipes, and sure enough I pulled up this awesome recipe (which was the same, but correct).  Thanks for being such great help!  I had many compliments on this.

These were absolutely delicious.  I followed this recipe to a T and they didn't taste like they needed to be changed at all.  I do however like the idea a previous member commented on and that is replacing with applesauce for the oil and the 1 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup of sugar.  I think I too will try that and see how it goes, but this was a great addition to the Thanksgiving Treats and went well with the crowd!

The recipe was very easy and they tasted great.  The only problem I had was I did not have quite enough frosting to cover the whole pan. I will absolutely make it again.

I do have to say I won't be making these very often....for fear that I will gain 100 pounds very quickly!!:)
This stuff is sooooo good! I made it in a 9x13 pan, and between myself, my husband and our two girls they were gone in two days! Thanks! YUMMY

Really good! The frosting didn't set up quite as well as I'd hoped (I like it to get firm on top) but these were still delicious! Brought them to a friend's house and they were wiped clean!

WOW! This is so delicious and moist! My can of pumpkin puree was 19 oz and I used all of it. I didn't have a 10 x 15 pan, so I used a 12 x 17 pan and baked for 25 minutes. We can't stop eating it even without the cream cheese frosting!

Very tasty and easy to make! I added 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice to spice it up a bit more. Gave it a 4 because it was more like cake than bars. Will make again though.

I prepared and baked exactly as directed...My came out dry and bland.
Maybe the cooking time needs to be adjusted, or perhaps, check your batch 10 minutes before cook time expires.  Also, perhaps add some pumpkin pie spice.

Overall, this was very very good. Got lots of compliments from co-workers and friends. I even gave out the recipe to a few people. The only disappointment was that it did taste like cake and not bars. I was trying to stay away from making a cake. The name of this recipe should be changed to "cake". It was incredibly moist and the frosting was delectable. It was hard to just eat one piece. Loved it!!

These pumpkin bars were DELICIOUS!  I can not even explain how good they are unless you try them yourself!  I made them two days ago and they are almost gone.  I just finished cleaning up my kitchen now because I made another batch already!  They are so moist and tasty and something a little different for a change  :-)  Excellent recipe that I will hold on to forever now!

This is very moist. It's more like a cake than bars, but I had to bake it in a 9x13 pan. Still very nice though.
I shared it with some of my Australian co-workers and they liked it. Pumpkin is eaten as roasted with meat and veggies or as a soup. Never as a dessert so this was different for them, but it went over well.
This is good with our without the icing.

Used a 9x13 pan and it turned out just like cake, not "bars" (and everyone thought it was carrot cake bc of the spices  the cream cheese frosting). But it still was delicious!

Great!  A wonderful combination of pumpkin, spices and cream cheese.  I did substitute 1 cup applesauce for the 1 cup oil.  It was so delicious! A people pleaser and easy to make! Thanks Paul!

Excellent!  I added a bit more cream cheese to the frosting though, to give it more of that taste!  Very moist.

I was looking for a bar cookie for a party and ended up with cake.  The cake was good because I added other spices.  This was dissapointing.

These are great. I used pumpkin pie filling instead of the straight old pumpkin and it was amazing. This would be perfect for a office party or holiday party. Great stuff!!!

Family and friends enjoyed this recipe.  Very moist, and good with nuts, too.  I did add a couple extra ounces of cream cheese to the frosting and it was really good.  Thanks for this recipe Deb.  Angela

I added 1/2 half again the ingredients for the bars and doubled the frosting ingredients. Perfect for 2 9X13 pans for pot lucks for both my husband and I. The compliments were great!

Every Sat. I bring something I bake to work and these were a big hit!! On Sun., the first thing different people greeted me with was, "Those were awesome!" Even though I have never baked the same thing twice for them, they will get Pumpkin bars again this Sat. by popular demand.

I  made this in a 9x12" pan it turned out great.  My boyfriend isn't a big pumpkin pie fan but he LOVED these bars!  They are soooooo good - moist and delicious, and the frosting goes really well w/ the cake.  You have to make these!

Fabulous pumpkin bars - thanks Deb for posting the recipe.  They were so good that I had to give some to two families.  Otherwise, we would have eaten the entire pan.  So nice to find such a yummy dessert that is so easy.
