I couldn't find any stores that carry the lemon grass, so I used some grated product that I found in an Asian market. I also added some grated fresh ginger. The taste was terrific, but without an ice cream maker, it was more like shave ice than sorbet. I will try it again when I have an ice cream maker and see how it works.
