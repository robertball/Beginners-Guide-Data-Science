My son loves boston cream pie so I tried this cake for his birthday. It was great. I used less milk in the pudding (1c.) might try 1&1/2c. next time. Chilled the pudding first and the cakes before putting together. I also sliced the rounded top off the bottom cake so pudding would sit nicely. French vanilla instant pudding gives it the custard effect. Extremely easy.

WOW!!!! THIS CAKE WAS AWESOME!!!!!! IT was just Devoured!!! Using one cup of milk in pudding is CRUICIAL! As is letting the pudding and cake cool completely. The pudding turns stiff, kinda like Mousse or Flan. That makes it PERFECT for spreading between layers. I LOVED THIS CAKE!!! THANKS!! New Family Fav!

Not only is this recipe easy - It tastes great!  I used French Vanilla cake mix and pudding because that's what I had.  I also used only 1Cup milk - I think I could have used 1 1/4 and had a little more pudding, but it worked out fine.  The key is to make sure EVERYTHING is cool.  I put the cake and pudding in the fridge before assembling.  With the cake cold the icing cooled quickly and set easily on the cake instead of just drizzling off the cake and onto the pan.

Was delicious!! you HAVE to chill the pudding, and the cake. I cut the milk to 1 1/2c. And this worked out perfectly! I made it for valentines day in a heart shaped cake pan. Placed on a cake platter, and drizzled melted choc. around the plate- looks wonderful! (and taste's wonderful too!)

This recipe was a great hit.  When I was leveling off the bottom cake, my husband asked me to carve out some so I could fit more pudding inside.  I did, and it was really yummy, the only thing I would suggest is to make sure not to carve to close to the edges so the outside 'wall' doesn't break and the pudding leak out.

I just made this cake for my mother-in-law's birthday.  I have to say... I really was a bit hesistant to make it.  The "bad" reviews it got scared me a little.  However, I took my chances and I am so glad I didn't let those "bad" reviews deter me.  The only piece of advise I can give is to TAKE YOUR TIME.  If you follow the directions and take your time measuring out everything, you cannot mess this cake up.  I baked the cakes, made the pudding (only used 1 1/4 cup of cold skim milk), waited for the cakes to cool completely.  Then I assembled the cake with the pudding (not messy at all).  I bought the new microwavable frosting and poured it ALL over the top of the cake and then slowly spread the frosting to drip off of the edges.  It looked silly so I just frosted the sides perfectly and added some colorful sprinkles.  LOOKS PERFECT.  The only reason I gave it four starts was because I haven't tried it yet.  It might appear delicious, but I never judge a book by it's cover.

This cake was so good I could barely keep it in the house. Everyone wanted some. My husband loves boston cream doughnuts and just adored this cake. A little advice, keep everything refrigerated even the cakes until you are ready to put it together. Definetly heat the frosting in the microwave for a minuet and then pour over the cake. Make sure the cake is on a big enough dish so the frosting doesn't go everywhere. Also cut the pudding down to 1 cup of milk. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little messy but if you keep it cold it comes out perfect. Just make sure to refrigerate cake when you are done! :0)

Maxie29 got it just right....I followed her suggestions (less milk in the pudding and let it set a while) and the pudding stood up to the cake.  I let the cake sit a while too, and frosted the top while it was totally stable in the counter before I put it on top of the wiggling pudding.  It ain't exactly home made from scratch, but then, it wasn't nearly as hard either...definately worth a try.

Easy to make, presents well.  I used (it's what I had) 2 - 3.4 oz pkg of Vanilla pudding.  I didn't spread all of the pudding in, due to I thought it may be overkill... I should've put all that pudding in there.  Yep, I'll make this one again.

I used french vanilla box cake, vanilla pudding and chocolate buttercream frosting because it's what I had on hand. I will make this again, only I will take other users advice to use less milk in the pudding to make it thicker. Definetly refrigerate this cake. Thanks for the recipe.

This was amazing I am not an excellent baker but this turned out great my only thought would be to freeze the pudding in a round cake pan over plastic wrap because the filling oozed out after i added the top layer and before i could get all the frosting on. even so it still taste great

I made this for father's day since my dad loves Boston Cream Pie.  I felt a little guilty about all the ingredients coming out of boxes, so I made the icing from Boston Cream Pie II to feel like it was somewhat homemade.  That chocolate glaze recipe ended up being really thick so I htinned it out with some milk and it turned out perfect.  In the pudding, I used about 2 1/2 cups of milk since I had forgotten that other reviews had said to cut back until I was already dumping it in. I liked the consistency and would use the same amount again.  I refridgerated the cake and pudding before assembling, topped it with the icing and put it back in the refridgerator.  The icing hardened a little from being cold so I pulled it out right before dinner so it would soften for dessert.  I LOVE this cake!  It tastes so good and it's so easy to make!

I loved this- made it way more fancy just for fun. I followed the recipe, cutting the milk for pudding down to 1 1/2 cups for a thicker consistency. Made 2 9" round cakes and when cooled- crumbled the cakes. I got some really cute (and cheap) dessert dishes from the dollar store. I layered the ingredients- cake then pudding, then more cake. I melted the frosting a bit to make it creamy and poured a layer on top. Put a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkled some crushed graham crackers on top. From easy to fancy in no time! Love this!

I wrote that I would try it with a Chocolate cake mix. Did not like it that way.  Maybe becasue the cake mix called for oil? When I made it with a yellow cake mix it called for butter or margerine. It was good with the yellow cake mix. The pudding was good this time using 1 1/4 cup water.

I hate "cake-from-a-box" but this was terrific!!!.  I used reduced sugar cake mix (used applesauce instead of oil), fat-free sugar free pudding (used only 1 1/4 skim milk - perfect)and reduced sugar frosting.  It didn't taste like a cake from a box nor a low fat/low sugar dessert.  I highly recommend this recipe for a quick and easy dessert!

It was ok, but the filling was very runny and ruined the cake.  Tastes good, but very "convenience food" like.

I love Boston Cream Pie, but always thought it was difficult to make. When I saw this recipe I couldn't help, but to try it--it had all of my favorite ingredients, I had them on hand, and the directions were super easy. I thought the large package of pudding was too much just to go in between the layers so I added some on top. I made sure to chill the cake before drizzling the warm frosting on top. It worked. Next time I'll divide both cake layers to have "fancier" cake & to distribute the pudding better. I also only drizzled the frosting & used only half of the can, which was plenty. I loved this cake & so did my kids. I will definitely make this again!

I took the suggestion of using 1 1/4 cup of milk in the french vanilla instant pudding and the filling was great.  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site and did that in the microwave which literally took two minutes.  Easy, quick and delicious.

The taste on this cake was very good but making the recipe as directed turned into a big mess.  The filling was too runny so it just oozed over the sides and was impossible to ice.  Mine fell apart and the  presentation was not anything i would ever serve.

Great recipe! Very quick and easy, although I did alter it a little.  I only used a 1 1/2 c. of milk in the pudding mix as some of the other reviews said to. I too chilled the pudding and the cake before putting it all together. When I was leveling the bottom layer I decided to make a dip in mine to hold more of the pudding. I  didn't have any chocolate frosting or all the ingredients to make frosting, so I melted 6 Hershey's Bars with about a 1/4 cup of milk and a tablespoon of vegetable oil until it was smooth, (about the consistency of pancake syrup). I then poured the chocolate over the top, completly covering it, until it started running down the sides. Not only did it look great it also tasted great. All my kids and my wife just loved it!

I was gonna  submit this exact recipe, as Im a lover of Boston Cream Pie, but am pretty much fed up with the expensive, from scratch recipes out there. Hey, dessert is an indulgence, so who cares if you have a little transfat in your frosting via a can of whipped frosting once in awhile?  I use the Duncan Hines Yellow cake, jell-o instant vanilla pudding, and the Duncan Hines whipped frosting. The only recommendations I have are that this cake works much better as a single layer cake, that you split in half and fill. It's just the right proportions between cake, custard and frosting. Also, rather than microwave, I prefer to frost the entire cake, tops and sides so that the cake is sealed and won't dry out. I keep it in the fridge on a plate, underneath and upside down pyrex bowl, and as I take a slice, I cover the exposed cake with a verticle piece of wax paper covering the cake, and not the frosting.

I could have easily written this recipe because it was the number one thing I craved while I was pregnant with my first child 4 years ago. I've also done a chocolate version (chocolate cake..chocolate pudding, and frosting) which is also quite tasty. Extra delicious! You *have* to keep it cold though..because that's when it's the yummiest!

I have to give this a 5 star rating.  The taste was excellent.  Very moist.  I made it for my hubby and father for Father's day.  They said they want me to definitely make again for the 4th of July.  The only bad thing is you have to be careful with the pudding.  I used about 3/4 of the prepared pudding and it still ran down the sides making the cake a little messy.  So use half or buy a smaller package of pudding.  But still I gave a 5 for moistness and taste.

Thanks for the recipe!!!!  It's a keeper.

This was very good and easy to do.  I used 2 cups of milk with the pudding mixture and it came out great!  I tried 1 cup the first time and that was a disaster.

Great idea to use pudding in center of cake. I made this for my son's birthday & he gave it a thumbs up. Will make this again!

This recipe is easy to make and delicious! I reduced the amount of milk used with the pudding mix to 1 1/2 cups.
I served it with mounds of whipped cream.
My family loved it.

This cake was great I did alter it though do to picky kids.  I use a cake extender recipe(big family)and added 1 vanilla pudding snack cup, melted the chocolate icing in microwave and used a spoon to drizzle and an angle kinda looks like the boston creme snack cake I served it hot DELICIOUS!!!! no pic cause they just couldn't wait. My husband is a pie lover and he absolutely loved it THANKS:))

I've been making this for 20+yrs.My mother-in-law used to buy the packaged version of this.It inspired me to create my own version as you never seem to get enough filling or frosting in the package.I bake a yellow cake cake as directed on the package in 2 round pans and only use one for this recipe(my boys aren't pudding lovers so I frost the remaining cake with the remaining frosting)I have found that using both cakes makes it too top heavy and squishes the filling out.For the filling I use Jello brand Vanilla pudding 153g size(6 Serv)with 2 1/4 cups milk and 1/2 tsp vanilla.I have used store brands but they always seem to taste like the packaging.I only buy skim milk so I mix 2c milk and 1/4c cream to make it creamier.Skim works but if you are going to eat cake............. I use approx. 2/3 on the tub of frosting.Careful not to heat for too long or it will end up pooling on the platter.I recently made this for a large group.I rented a large pan and tripled the recipe.It was a challenge to assemble but well worth the effort.It was a huge hit.

This was great!  And easy.  I also tried the opposite, chocolate cake with vanilla pudding and vanilla frosting.  It was also really good.

I had the hardest time with this cake for some reason. I burnt the first two cakes, I undercooked the second two cakes, finally the third two cakes came out right. By then the pudding had set overnight, I had prepared that per the box instructions. The top cake fell apart when I put it on the pudding. The whole cake just seemed very "boxy" tasting to me. I will not try again.

Very easy recipe and tasted great.  Big hit at the cookout.  I would recommend making the pudding with less milk, and allowing the pudding to sit before putting cake together.  Also skewers worked to keep it together while chilling.

I hated it, my family hated it, and it totally ruined my party.  It was hard to make (I am a whiz in the kitchen, btw) and it was a pain in the butt to clean up.  I'm throwing this recipe away.

This was not as easy to make as promised.  The pudding called for was way too much; when I put the top layer on, all the pudding slid down the side of the cake.  Difficult to put together, but it was delicious and a hit at the party.

A huge disaster!!!!  My pudding never set up.........do you think because I used rice milk??  I only used
1-1/4 c. but that pudding was runny as ever!!!  So I ended up making a cherry filling and it was still yummy!

As suggested I made the pudding with just one cup of milk and refrigerated it while the cake was baking.  I refrigerated the cake too just to be safe. It was great! I didn't have any trouble icing it or keeping it together.  Easy!

I made this and it just kind of fell apart when adding the pudding and the frosting 
i now have a cake pudding sludge that while not bad looks like it was dropped.
the cake needs something to help stabilize it.

This turned out way better than I expected. I used chocolate pudding (1.5 cups milk was perfect), and Chocolate Glaze 1 from this site. I don't have round pans, so I just used 2 glass pie plates. It worked pretty well! Hubby was impressed, I'll be doing this one again.

What a nightmare. Taste is fine but such a huge mess it is not presentable for the party that is planned. I baked according to directions, exactly, except I only used 1 cup milk in pudding. I waited for cake to cool, it was very cool and so was pudding. After pouring frosting on top it fell apart from there. Will not attempt again.

This is a recipe that I will make again.  I found this recipe when I was craving a decent dessert and wasn't disappointed.  As others suggested, I cut down the milk to 1 c. and it turned out nicely.  I like that it is relatively simple to make and uses things that you might already have on hand.  It winds up being pretty too.
