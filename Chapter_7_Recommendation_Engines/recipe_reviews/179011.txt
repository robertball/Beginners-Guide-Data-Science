This is the meal I prepared for my mother-in-law-to-be that convinced her that I am a great cook! Everyone that I fix this for always loves it. I've started adding a little graded cheddar cheese to it when it has 5 minutes left to go in the oven- try it! I think it's important to add, it always takes me more than 10 min to prepare!! (But I do cut mine into strips too.) Give yourself at least 15-20 min before it goes in the oven. For a side dish, I like steamed broccoli, rice, and I make a cheese sauce. Take the rest of the soup, add milk and cheddar cheese, heat it up and drizzle it over the rice and broccoli!  ~Jessica~

Good and Crunchy, I made strips out of the chicken instead. Definitely tastes like stuffing on chicken,if that's what you like. I did appreciate how thick the coating was with the cream of chicken soup though. Next time I would just use regular crumbs and all my own seasoning.

No complaints here. I made it exactly as stated and everyone loved it. We served it with mashed potatoes and corn & even used the sauce in the recipe as a gravy. Perfect!

I skipped the chicken soup and used another brand of stuffing. It turned out really good...and very easy chicken dish to make when hubby gets chicken strips instead of breasts. lol

My husband and I love this recipe!  I wasn't sure what the texture of the stuffing would be like once baked but it's pleasantly crunchy and very good.

Wasn't bad. I used tenders instead of breasts and they turned out nice. They are good but nothing special really and I could only get my daughter to eat one little piece

My husband and I have opposite tastes, but both agree that this recipe is fantastic! It's delicious and easy. I use the low sodium Stove Top chicken stuffing, and the healthy request cream of chicken soup - or low sodium - whichever I have at the time.

This chicken got a big "meh" from my family.  It was very bland.  We live in Louisiana so maybe we're just spice-spoiled, but this chicken was definitely nothing to get excited over.  Maybe if marinated/seasoned before hand, it would be better, but we'll probably pass this one up and not attempt it again.

I made this last minute with what I had on hand. I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup and Progresso bread crumbs and my son thought it was the best chicken I've made! Although next time I would like to try the stuffing.

Made exactly as written, using thin sliced chicken breast.  The flavor, texture--everything about it was wonderful.  Oh, I did forget to crush the stuffing mix, but it made no difference to me.  Will make again.

It was one of those days that supper needed to be cooked and I had very little in the cupboard so I tried this recipe with some substitutions. First off, I never have the packaged dressing on hand....personally I can't stand the taste of it. So I took some bread and dried it in the oven until crispy and a crushed it up with the spices I normally use for stuffing. I was a bit leery thinking the crust would get soggy but boy was I wrong! I could hear and feel the crunch taking it out of the pan. The leftover soup mix? I made scalloped potatoes to serve with this and I just added the soup to the milk with some thyme and a few other spices to tie in the flavours. One of the best meals I've made in a while!

I really liked the ease of making this dish. The chicken was very juicy inside. I did not have any of the pepperidge farms bread crumbs handy but did have regular generic bread crumbs. Turned out just fine, just not as "crunchy" as it would have with the PF bread crumbs. Paired it with some mashed potatoes. My family ate it all gone!

Delicious recipe. Made this for my wife and I and improvised a little as I didn't feel like running to the store for just stuffing. Used bread crumbs instead and it was delicious too!  Also I thickened up the sauce with the extra soup and milk by adding another can of soup and more milk and flour.  Made a nice gravy like texture that went well over the top of the chicken when I served it!  Really an easy recipe to do! Served mine with long grain and wild rice and corn

Good recipe for sure. It's a very simple recipe. I thought it was a touch bland so maybe I'll add some pepper to the sauce mix. Not overly impressed but it delivers what it claims and it is tasty.

This was an easy recipe to follow with great results.  I sliced the chicken into strips.  I made the mistake of powdering the stuffing. Next time I will be careful to leave then stuffing with more texture.  I think I will also broil the last few minutes to increase the couch.  This will remain a go-to recipe for flavorful chicken.

Bar far the best chicken we've ever had! my fiance & I really enjoy this we use cream of mushroom soup instead, but tonight we used cream of mushroom with garlic, and it was so delicious!  just a side note to cook it quicker 425 for 25 to 30 minutes depending on the thickness.  Try it you'll love it.

Amazing recipe!  This is the best crunchy chicken I have every made.  The breasts I had purchased were gianormous so I cut them in half lengthwise to ensure they were cooked throughout.  The leftovers (reheated in the oven) were even better the second time.

This was absolutely fantastic! Used cornbread stuffing and added about a teaspoon of garlic salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning to it. Also added about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder to the flour, but this was just to our taste. Chicken was very tender and juicy and the flavor was fantastic! Spiced up the gravy with a little cajun seasoning and italian seasoning as well. We did this all for our taste, this recipe doesn't need to be messed with, or can be adjusted to suit you. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

Husband liked.  Made according to recipe but pounded my chicken breasts to make more even and added fresh herbs to gravy. Makes gravy look gourmet!

Messy to make but was very good. Used a cut up chicken and increased the ingredients to suit.

This was delicious and so easy! My 8 year old helped with the prep and everyone in my family enjoyed it. That never happens! Next time I might add some additional spices to the stuffing crust but outside of that, I won’t change a thing. Served with sweet potato fries and corn.

Turned out quite good.  It reminds me of a chicken fried steak dinner made with chicken.

I omitted the flour and just soaked the breasts in the soup and milk then sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on each breast on the baking sheet.  We ate it over long grain wild rice and put the gravy over the top.  It was great!

I had a different dinner in mind but didn't have all the ingredients so I needed a quick backup. I am so glad I found this recipe. I made it exactly as instructed and fell in love with the results. My husband made himself miserable eating so much and even my picky toddler cleaned her plate. I wish I would have taken a picture but it was gobbled up way to quick.

excellent, tasty easy recipe.  I used tenders and Stove Top Stuffing chicken flavor (my favorite).  Served with home-made mashed potatoes, Campbell's chicken gravy, and corn.  Yum.

The flavor was light in a good way.  Crunchy without deep frying!
