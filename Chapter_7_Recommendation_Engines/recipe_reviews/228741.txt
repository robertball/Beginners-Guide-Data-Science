This is my favorite split pea soup recipe.  If I have the time, I make it over 2 days by making the broth from a ham bone, onion, any leftover vegetable, etc. simmered for several hours.  I toss all the junk in the now made broth except the ham.  Let the broth cool in fridge or in my case on my porch in these cold days.  Skim the fat.  It's wonderful broth to use in place of the water and broth listed.  I then use the rest of the ingredients from this recipe.  If I don't have time, I go with what's listed.  You can't beat it, and as other reviews say....don't skimp on the milk or cream!

Earlier,  I cooked up some leftover pork roast leg bones to make a broth.  I substituted leg bone broth in for the water.  
I also added 1 lb of cut up low sodium bacon and because my son is night shade vegetable sensitive, I added more vegetables in with the onions (4 carrots, 1-2 stalks of celery, 1 c. kale,  chopped fine and mashed in after the sauté) to make the recipe more meal friendly...... soooo it was a big hit!  
My younger son, said that it doesn't look appetizing, but it sure tastes great!  He comes home after being at the Gym and enjoys the soup for a well needed high protein snack.  :)

Very yummy and filling!   The chardonnay wine I used gave it a really nice flavor, but I did change it up a bit.   I used about 1/3 pound of bacon (because that's what I had on hand), added a pinch of cayenne pepper, used a large onion, and switched the water/broth type and ratio  to 4 cups of chicken broth with one cup of water.   This one goes in my favorites file!

When pork belly cubes were in pan, with them I sautéed garlic, shallots, onion, celery and carrots in bacon fat and added spices, and then I used 4 cups of pork bone and meat broth and one cup white wine. Simmered a couple hours and hand blended most of it to a nice purée. GOOD!!!

i  didn't have pork belly so I  used bacon, no leek so  used  one medium  onion chopped fine. I loved it. I used Chardonnay wine.
