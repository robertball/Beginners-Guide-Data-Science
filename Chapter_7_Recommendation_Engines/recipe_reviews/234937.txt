I always thought roasting 'taters was sooo easy. Truth is, sometimes they were good and sometimes, not so much. This requires more time but less stressing over sticking and burning. The outside of the potatoes were nicely browned and the insides were smooth and soft. Don't rush this but keep an eye on them the last 15 minutes, mine were cut a bit smaller and were done beforehand. I just used my iron fry pan in the oven and it worked very well. Thanks, Chef John!

Excellent recipe. I used 1 pound of potatoes seasoned with salt, freshly ground black pepper, thyme and red pepper flakes. After the first 30 minutes I added one whole cut up large red bell pepper and four sliced garlic cloves. My DH and I thoroughly enjoyed these potatoes.

I made this recipe last night as a side to the Chicken Cordon Bleu II recipe on this site. (also an awesome recipe!)  I'm not a potato lover in general b/c I think they are too starchy and bland.  This recipe was delicious and super flavorful!  I followed the recipe exactly with only two changes.  I substituted Savory (dried) because I did not have fresh or dried rosemary or thyme on hand.  I used it generously. And since I'm not wild about potatoes, I cut the red potatoes into bite-sized pieces, so you get less potato center in proportion to the crusted browned edges. Use a  small metal spatula to get under the potatoes without breaking them up instead of a spoon. Oh, I also added yellow peppers to the red ones suggested.  It made the dish so pretty! A wonderful recipe that I will definitely make again, especially for company since holding them only enhances the flavor!

Tried as written the potatoes were good by the dish was lacking.  Made them again when my daughter and her famiuly came over.  Added brussel sprouts onions and parmesan.  It was great even the baby (5yo) wanted more.

P.S.  everything is better with garlic......

I followed the recipe as written and these potatoes turned out perfectly.  Crispy and nicely browned on the outside but moist and yummy on the inside.  Served this with Sage Pork Chops from this site.  I wanted to take a photo but they were gone before I had the chance...

Just like the video suggested, I used fresh rosemary instead of thyme because that's what I had.  These were a great side-dish!

I love this recipe. So simple.  The potatoes came out just perfectly!!  I served these with Chicken Breasts with Mushrooms, Onions,Thyme and Borsin Cream Sauce. I didn't have a bell pepper and seeing that we were snowed in that day I wasn't able to get one either. At first I was dissapointed,but, tried the recipe anyway.....and to my surprise, I was NOT dissapointed, the came out just as promised. This is a keeper,I will use this recipe over and over again. Try it you will be very pleased.

This is the easiest, most delicious and fool-proof way to make crispy roasted potatoes. Allow enough time and it works beautifully. Try to rush it or to add other kinds of root veggies with different water content, and it won't turn out the same!  Kudos to Chef John. I love your sense of humor!

Flavor was great but the potatoes stuck to the Dutch oven despite the oil. I tried them on a baking sheet the next time and they cooked far more quickly than anticipated. The third time I was a bit gun shy and they should have been in longer. I didn’t get the great crispy skin shown in the pics. Oh well, I am just a hack after all :-)

I roast potatoes in a frying pan that does that does take nearly as long. I just cut the potatoes into small chunks, then coat the pan with oil and coat the potatoes with a mix of crushed red peppers, salt, black pepper, and olive oil. Then I would pop the lid on the pan for about 7-10 mins on medium heat. Then I would flip them and keep doing that until I think their done.

Absolutely great!  I used coconut aminos in place of soy sauce and coconut oil in place of olive.  Cut the mini red potatoes up into quarters.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.   I've made these potatoes twice.   Once with fresh herbs, once with just salt and pepper.   Both times were GREAT!    
The second time I also made oven fried chicken and cooked it at the same time (separate pan) as the potatoes.  Great way to get dinner done fast.
Chef John never disappoints.    "AS ALWAYS, ENJOY".

This recipe comes out like frying in a cast iron skillet, without all the tending. Second try I substituted new baby mini Yukons. Added white onion cut the same size as red pepper.  Added Celtic grey sea salt, Telecherry coarse cracked pepper with citrus peel, Tuscan Sunset spice instead of cayenne. Different flavors but same crispy candied result!

Super yummy!  I made it as a side dish to our salads for dinner and my husband loved it!  Just watch the cooking time as I my have overcooked just a bit - they were super soft but crispy on the outside.  It will still be our go to!

i have made these 3 times now.  Everyone loves them.  I try to cook them a little crispy.  You can season almost any way to suit the rest of the dishes you are making.  I used left overs for breakfast the next day.

I love this recipe. I’ve been using it for over a year and it’s always perfect, unless I’m chincy with the salt. Your patience will be rewarded.

This all sounds great but for an authentic British roast potato boil the potatoes first but only until you see the potatoes go from white to yellow (partially cooked) then continue with recipe

So simple, SO delicious! Thank you Chef John. Didn't have time to let sit in oven the last 15 minutes but they were perfect. Used about 3/4 tsp pink salt, and sprinkled with dried organic Thyme. Used a little fresh ground pepper, no Cayenne, everything else as written.

Chef John, thank you so much for this recipe!  I have made them twice now.

On the second time, I used an apple cutter to cut the potatoes into 8 wedges, plus a core part.  Easy, quick and of course I used the round piece as well.

Also excellent left over (If there are any!)

Y husband and I are on low sodium diets. These roasted potatoes have been a life saver. Roll in olive oil, use Mrs. Dash no sodium garlic, onion with herbs. Eliminate salt. Sprinkle with ,Smokey Paprika lightly, follow rest of recipe. They are delicious.  Anyone with a low sodium this is a great recipe.  Just leave off the salt...FLAVOR COMES FROM THE HERBS.

Added onions, green peppers, Italian sausage cut into one inch pieces, dry white wine.  Cover bake as suggested, uncover when 1/2 done.  Let excess fluid from onions and peppers evaporate .  This makes a whole meal.  Outstanding!

I have never had much success at potatoes in the oven but these turned out wonderfully! I didn't think a glass pan would work for a heavy pan so I ended up using the bottom of a broiler pan. It worked great. I will make these again and again  (with or without the red pepper).

I loved this recipe.  It was the best and easiest recipe for making roasted potatoes.  In the oven, you can have as many potatoes in the pan as you want and they still all get cooked and browned equally.  I used my large cast iron pan and I would gladly do it again.

I cut the red potatoes up as suggested, but then decided to microwave them for about 8 minutes on high, then put them in the oven.  I used 400 degrees, but next time I'll use 450 degrees... all to shorten the cooking time.  I cooked the potatoes for about 25 mins at 400, next time I'll use 450 to shorten the process even more.  They turned out good.

Wish l knew this was so easy years ago!  Great, simple recipe that offers a lot of versatility should you choose to go with different spices or add other veggies like onions.  A new staple for our family!  By the way I? put all my cut veggies in a bowl the added oil, stirred, and did the same with the seasoning before roasting. It helps insure even coverage.

Good but not as successful as Chef John's "Special" roasted potatoes recipe with the preboiling. I used the exact same kind of baking dish he recommended in the video, the same heat and oil, etc, but had tremendous sticking after the first 30 min, not a single "free" potatoes to toss!, not at all like the video. Was able to safely reposition everything at the second "toss" but with much careful scraping. Potatoes came out well in the end, but he peppers? Fairly blah, did not caramelize at all :(

I really like this receipt.  The first time I made it, I followed the instructions exactly but I found the potatoes were to dry for my liking.  The second time, I eliminated the last roasting time and they turned out great!

Very flavorful potatoes!  The red bell pepper imparts a rich complexity that one wouldn't expect from a potato.  Excellent!  It was a big hit with my guests.  I served it with Chef John's Pork Tenderloin Diablo.   As always, a dash of cayenne really adds to the dish as well.

Followed the recipe to the T.  Taters came out great.  So good, my son sat at the table talking to his grandfather and almost finished off the potatoes one by one.

Best roasted potatoes ever.  And great timing, I had fresh thyme and peppers coming out of the garden.  I boiled my potatoes for about five minutes to give them a head start.  Took about 50 minutes in the oven. Already made it a second time.
