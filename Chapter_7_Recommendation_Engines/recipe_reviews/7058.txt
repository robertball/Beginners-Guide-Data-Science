This is my revised rating, I rated it several months ago, and now make this bread about 3 times a week. Of course, it's still a 5, I just found some ways to make it even better, and perhaps my tips can help someone else. I use the Basic setting, NOT the wheat, and I use the light crust option. I mix all dry ingredients together-except for salt-before adding them to the machine, including 3 TBS of vital wheat gluten (1 TBS per cup of flour). My machine takes wet ingredients first, and I add the salt to the liquids instead of the dry, because I have learned that salt can kill the yeast at a certain stage. I have had no more problems with rising since I started doing this (and also adding the wheat gluten). 

This bread is my family's standby...we haven't bought bread in several months! It's wonderful to see my loved ones eating such healthy bread, and it's very easy to make in the bread machine. Sometimes I even mix up the flour mix in separate bags, and then when I want to make a batch, I just dump a premixed bag in with the water, salt, honey, and yeast. It's working out just fine, thank you for such an easy, healthy recipe that is now our basic every-day bread.

Wonderful whole wheat bread ... my family loved the sweetness.  I did substitute butter for the shortening and it turned out great.  The crust was a little chewy so will bake it on "light crust" next time.

This recipe was fantastic! YUMMY! I used 1 cup of unbleached bread flour and 2 cups of stone ground whole wheat to get a better rise.  I don't have a bread machine, so i proofed the yeast and made the dough in my mixer with a dough hook.  For the few people having trouble with this recipe, the recipe works, but bread can be tricky if you don't understand the basics.  If you're making this in a bread machine and adding the yeast with all of the dry ingredients, take note of a few things:  first, the water needs to be the right temp. around 120 degrees F if you are adding yeast to the dry ingredients in the breadmaker.  if it is not warm enough, the yeast will not activate, if it is too warm (about 130 degrees) the water will burn and kill the yeast.  the honey content needs to be just right as the yeast eat sugar, and like people, they can starve or overeat if there is too much sugar in the recipe (which makes them lethargic), if you want more honey, add more yeast. also, wheat flour must be kneaded longer to glutenize, i kneaded it for about 10-15 minutes.

I didn't have the dry milk so I too used 1 cup water 1/8 cup skim milk. I also subbed 2 tbsp. canola oil for the shortening.  I proofed the yeast in the cup of water at(110 degrees) sprinkled with a little sugar.  Let the yeast proof for 5 minutes or so. That way you do not waste ingredients, if your yeast doesn't proof START OVER because your loaf will be rock hard.  I have a kitchen aid mixer so I let that do the kneading for about 2 minutes. I do not have a bread machine either so I let it rise once for and hour, then I put it in the greased breadpan and let it rise another hour.  It baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  It was GREAT bread.  My 8 yr. old loved it and had no idea it was good for him.  Thanks for this recipe!!

YESS! I played around with this  a couple of times and used some of the other reviewers suggestions, and finally came up with a perfect loaf of sandwich bread.  or serve a nice, warm, buttered slice w/ soup.  Delicious!! SO here's what I did (based on other reviews): 1. Used butter instead of shortening (and put it in w/ the wet ingredients).  2. Subbed 1/8 cup warm milk for 1/8 cup of water, because i didn't have milk powder.  3.  Used 1 cup of unbleached bread flour and 2 cups whole wheat. 4. Added 2 TBSP of wheat gluten and mixed dry ingredients (except yeast and salt) before putting in the machine. 5.  Cooked on the white bread (basic) setting & light color, as someone recommended.  It turned out PERFECT.  Perfect height, shape, texture, and great flavor.  Hearty but still soft.  I am going to try upping the whole wheat flour 1/8 cup at a time, as I'd like to do 100% WW but it never seems to make a very good loaf for sandwiches. Thanks everyone for the tips!

The best wheat bread I've made.  Light, soft and moist, with a hint of honey.  I've made this several times, and will keep on making it.

We love this recipe!  I've been making it for months now.  I use whole wheat that I grind myself.  In order to accomodate my Zojirushi Bread Maker (2lb loaf), I adapted the recipe to 16 servings.  For a perfect loaf I add the salt to the water, 3T. of wheat gluten to the flour and I sub butter for shortening.  Bake on the Basic/Light setting not wheat.  If bread is still a little too dark, decrease honey (the extra sugar content is what causes browning.  Thank you for a wonderfully healthy recipe!

Excellent!  I was looking for a whole wheat bread recipe that used whole wheat flour only, and this was perfect. I doubled the recipe for 2 nice loaves. I do not have a bread machine, so I dissolved the yeast in the water with the honey mixed in, that had been warmed to 110-115 degrees. I proofed the yeast, then added the salt & olive oil for shortening, then mixed in the flour gradually along with the dry milk.  Kneaded for about 8 minutes, let rise, punched down and formed the loaves and let them rise, and then baked for 30 mins at 350.  It is delicious and not too dense or heavy at all, like some wheat breads can be. I highly recommend.  If any of you like the Amish White Bread recipe for white bread, you will love this recipe.  I now have a dependable whole wheat recipe.

Good riddance, store-bought bread!  Couldn't be happier with how this turned out!  There's a similar recipe on this site called "Honey Whole Wheat Bread" that calls for basically the same ingredients, except 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I was happy to find this one with all whole wheat flour (bread flour is not whole grain, whereas whole wheat flour is).  Anyway, it turned out wonderfully!  Soft, moist, whole grainy goodness with just a hint of sweet.  Also, I substituted vegetable oil for the shortening.  I'd like to try e.v. olive oil next time and see how it does.  One note - a lot of people complained about it not rising, etc. - I had no problems at all with my Breadman bread machine.  Don't know why they did?  My guess is they may have not layered the ingredients into the machine in the order they should have.  Make sure to put the wet ingredients into the maker first (including the salt).  Then, on top of the wet ingredients add the flour.  Make a fairly shallow little indentation in the top of the flour (maybe 1/2" deep) with your finger and pour the yeast into that little groove.  This keeps the yeast away from the salt and water until it's ready to be mixed in.  Once you've layered the ingredients properly, shut the lid, choose the setting (1.5 lb whole wheat loaf), and press start!  Voila!

This bread was so delicious and tasty!  It makes me want to make it all the time and forget about about those store bought items.  It is so healthy, too!  It was one of the only recipes that we could find that called for all whole wheat flour instead of half white and half wheat flour.  I made one heart healthy substitution of applesauce for the shortening.  Who wants to throw shortening in something so healthy?  Yuck!  Applesauce works the same way and makes the bread more moist.  Just use the same measurements.  Cheers to breadmakers who do all that hard work of kneeding for you these days and make delicious bread.  All I had to do was throw the ingredients in- and voila!  I will be making this bread again and again.

Great recipe, made it many times now.  I add 3 tbs of vital gluten and use butter instead of shortening for better flavor.  I use the breadmaker to make the dough and freeze half.  The other half is placed in a bread pan and allowed to rise for an hour or so then cooked in a conventional oven at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.  (Bake for 45 minutes if using the whole loaf)

Wow!! I made this last night and it came out perfect.  I followed the advice of other people who had tried it and I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat bread flour and 1 1/2 cups of bread flour, and I used 1/8 cup of milk and deducted it from the water instead of the dried milk.  I also sprinkled some sugar on top of the yeast- this seems to help it rise a little bit more.  This bread was light and tasted great.  I will be making this on a regular basis.

This is a wonderful recipe! all my past attempts at whole wheat bread had turned out disasterous, this loaf was perfect. It's slightly sweet, light and well textured. I substitued butter for the shortning and 1/2 cup wheat gluten for 1/2 cup of the flour. I also added a handful of toasted walnuts to give it that expensive bread taste. I will add more nuts next time and maybe some sesamee seed or sunflower seeds as well. Makes a fantastic ham sandwich!

This bread is so delicious! The modifications that I like are: Use whole wheat, wheat and oat bran to in place of just wheat flour. I halved the amount the honey and it still turned out sweet enough. I omitted the dry milk and substituted water with milk. For shortening I used tub margarin. In the end, this loaf turned out yummy and good in the bread maker. It's even great after a week in the fridge!

Very good, although I will probably lower the salt to just 1 tsp.  I also added wheat germ and flax seed meal to up the fiber and nutritional content.  My kids liked this better than the recipe I've been making for the last year so I guess this will be the new family bread recipe!
**NOTE TO THOSE WHO SAY IT DIDN'T RISE - make sure a)that your water isn't too warm or it'll kill the yeast, b) that your yeast is good (you can test it by adding a pinch of yeast to some slightly warm water and if it "grows" and foams up then your yeast is good, and c) that your salt doesn't come into contact directly with your yeast or the salt will kill the yeast.

This bread was a little heavier than I expected, but a very pleasant surprise!  It had just a hint of sweetness, and was very moist.  My whole family loved it.

This recipe in a bread machine came out fantastic. The bread had a full body, wonderful tecture, and moist and not dry.I used 1T of milk instead of dry milk,1/2C of Honey. I placed the warm water and dry yeast first,then the rest of the ingredients with the flour last. Dave

If I could give this 10 STARS I would.  This is by far the best whole wheat bread I've ever made in my bread machine.  I love that there are just a few basic ingredients that I always have on hand. I used shortening the first time and butter the second time with no difference in the loaf.  I did not have to add gluten or modify it in any way.  Try it as written before you start tweaking it.  It is perfect for sandwiches - I may never buy bread again all because of this recipe!

Made this bread today with some modifications after reading the reviews -- it was the bomb! It was extremely light for a whole wheat bread. We've tried several whole wheat bread recipes, looking for a loaf we can make for our day-to-day bread -- this recipe fits the bill. Healthful, but not heavy. 

Mods: subbed butter for shortening, reduced honey to 1/4 c, added 3T wheat gluten, upped milk powder to 1 1/2T. 

I also followed Flannery's suggestion of combining the salt with the water instead of with the dry ingredients (I actually combined water, salt, honey, and butter in a pyrex measuring cup and microwaved slightly to bring liquid temp to approx 110º before adding to the bread machine). Then mixed dry ingredients separately before adding to the bread machine. I don't know if these steps made a difference, but they make sense to me and didn't take much longer. The bread came out so well that I'll probably keep following this method.

This is a favorite of everyone I bake it for!  Great consistency and texture.  I use about 1 1/4 cup water vs what the recipe calls for and use the manual cycle on my machine, then shape into a loaf, let rise and bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  It is perfect every time.

This bread is amazing!  I don't use a bread maker, so I kneaded the dough, then let it double in size.  I punched it down, kneaded it some more and then put it into 2 greased bread pans and let it rise again.  I then put it in a 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes until browned.

This bread is awesome!  It is moist and hearty with a tinge of sweetness.  I added 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of gluten to the mix.  My boyfriend and I gobbled it up with fresh fish and sausages hot off the grill!

I tried making this bread 4 times this week to get it right, because it bothered me to follow the instructions and not have it turn out! The first try, I followed the recipe exactly (except using butter instead of shortening and 1/8C milk for powdered milk) and it was a flop. I also used soft whole wheat flour (not thinking there was a difference).The recipe states to use the whole wheat setting but like other reviewers suggested, they said use basic and the time given on the recipe was closer to the basic setting, so I used basic. The salt was added with the flour (because I consider that a dry ingredient). The loaf was dense and sweet. So it was a fail. The second attempt, I used whole wheat bread machine flour as the only change and that was a flop. Slightly better than the last, but still horrible in terms of rising. So now, here are the tricks. You can use hard whole wheat flour or whole wheat bread machine flour, BUT remove 1 tbsp for every cup you put in, and replace it with gluten flour (which is the same as vital wheat gluten - so many names). Add the salt with the liquids on the bottom. And use INSTANT yeast instead of dry active yeast and DO set it on the Whole Grain/Wheat Setting. It allows longer time for rising and gives you wonderful whole wheat bread. Better than store-bought. And use the light crust setting. I've played arounf and added seeds, herbs, flax and it's great. I just use less than half the honey because I found the full too sweet - my bf agreed.

I have FINALLY figured this one out.  I was having trouble with the loaf not rising correctly and being very dense.  Perhaps it's my bread machine, but this is what I do...a little unconventional, but it's what works for me.  I proof the yeast in the 110 degree water with the honey in the bottom of my bread machine pan (yes, I know you're supposed to add yeast last, but this allows it to start its work a little early).  I proof it until the yeast starts to float to the top.  Then I add oil (I use olive oil, not shortening), and the rest of the dry ingredients on top of the liquid, ending with the salt on the top.  I add the 3 tablespoons gluten, as well.  I use the basic setting on my bread machine, light crust.  This is what works for me.  Like I said, maybe it wasn't working as written because of my machine, but I thought I would share, in case someone else out there was having the same problems.  This produces a light, flavorful bread that people love.  And if you make a basil butter for it, you'll be in heaven!

Just finished trying a piece of this bread.  Wow... really great taste.  I used butter instead of shortening, added wheat gluten (1 1/2 Tbsp.) I will, however the next time, cut down the honey as I thought it a little too sweet for my taste.  I don't have a bread machine so I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes in my electric oven.  I will probably add a little more gluten the next time too to help it raise a little more.  Thanks for sharing this treasure!

The first time I made this, I would of gave this a four. The flavor was there,yet extremely dense. Second time around I used margarine instead of shortening and did the 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 wheat. The results wowed me. I haven't bought bread in weeks now.

LOVE this recipe!  Made the changes someone suggested by using 1 cup water, 1/8 cup milk, and the honey heated in the microwave along with half wheat flour/half bread flour and my family loved it! It was gone almost immediately.  I am making another loaf right now and of course, I had to play with it a little.  I added 1/8 cup steel cut oats and 1/8 cup wheat berries to make it a heartier loaf and I have no doubt it will be spectacular.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Very tasty!  I think I might add just a little more honey next time to give more honey flavor.  I will make this again - it was a big hit at the dinner table.

I omitted the water and milk powder and substituted milk for it.  This was soft and delicious!  Perfect!

What on earth?!  I wasn't expecting anything other than a mediocre tasting bread (sorry! I was in a hurry!).  This bread turned out surprisingly tasty - especially for a 100% wheat flour bread!  I'm  not kidding when I said I was in a hurry...not having a bread machine, I tossed all of the ingredients into the Kitchenaid (no proofing required thanks to ACTIVE dried yeast, btw), cranked that baby up, added some vital wheat gluten (1 T) to it to bring it together (didn't want to set up), beat the living tar out of it in the mixer, started to let it rise, but decided it probably wasn't going to turn out anyway, so I formed it into a single loaf pan, let it rise on the warm stovetop as the oven was heating up (it did rise - much to my surprise - I thought my yeast had died), slashed the top a couple of times with a knife, tossed it into the oven at 375F for 35 minutes and voila!  It made a BEAUTIFULLY formed, dense, but not too dense loaf that was cooked perfectly throughout.  To avoid a hard crust, I brushed some butter across the top (erm...ran the butter stick across the top...).

This is the PERFECT sandwich and toast bread.  Holds up nicely when slicing (just make sure to cool it thoroughly before making your first cut!).

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Great tasting bread and easy to make even without a bread machine thanks to another reviewer (SCHMOO2) who broke it down for me.  Those who don't have bread machines just follow those instructions and you will be all set to enjoy this bread. Absolutely worth the time to make as it was great and it was only my second time trying to bake bread with yeast.  My husband absolutely LOVED it.  Thanks Melinda for sharing and thanks to SCHMOO2 for breaking it down for those of us who don't have bread machines!

This is a keeper!   I made changes to the recipe according to what others suggested and it turned out great.  I used all white whole wheat pastry flour, canola oil instead of shortening, only 1 cup of water then used 1/8 cup of milk instead of the milk powder and also added 3 tbsp. vital wheat gluten.  It's so quick and easy.  The bread is light and fluffy. I also used the dough cycle then baked it in a well greased bread pan in the oven at 350.  No more store bought bread for us!

This is a supurb bread. I made a few changes for me. I added 1/2 c of sourdough starter in place of some of the water and added about 3 T of vital wheat gluten. I also added 1 c of whole wheat pastry flour in place of some of the whole wheat flour to make it lighter. I make this bread at least 2 times a week. This is the best.

Hi! This is my first time rating a recipe at this site. All I can say is THANK YOU!!!! Well, I guess I have alittle more to say than that. I have had such terrible sucess at making really good making any kind of whole grain bread. When I was reading the recipe I was quite the cynic, but with the average rating being 5 stars, I thought I'd at least give a try. I am so amazed at how this bread turned out. It is moist, light and fluffy and the perfect flavor. 
I did have to make some minor changes due to the ingredients that I had on hand but it still turned out like everyone was saying. 
I didn't have any honey, however I had just bought a jar of molasses. Thr first time I made the bread I used 1/2 cup of molasses -- mistake. It was good but it was too sweet. So tonight when I made the bread, I used 1/3 cup and it came out just the way my husband likes his whole wheat bread. The other thing I did use half wheat flour and half white. Then I cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon because I wanted a fluffier bread. After it cooled, we dove in. PERFECTION! My husband and I just ate turkey sandwiches w/ lettuce and tomato and cheese. He told me that I was finally catching on to baking bread. I didn't want to tell him that all the credit should go to you. [I hope you don't mind =)]You have my vote! Keep up the great work!!!!
Vicky
Sorry about the length of this post!

Great recipe! I made a 2 lb recipe (18 servings) twice on the white bread setting as others suggested.  The first time I did not vary from the original.  The second time I reduced honey to 3T and added 2T olive oil instead of the 2T+1+1/2 t shortening for what I hope is a healthier loaf.  The second rose better than the first and makes a little lighter loaf, but does not slice as well as the first denser loaf.  Both are wonderful!  This is the first time I have tinkered successfully with a bread recipe and it's hard to ruin this one!  Thank you!!

I have been trying different wheat recipes in my bread machine for about a year. I have been looking for the "just right" sandwich size bread for packing lunches. This is it!! I finally found it! I used the recommendations from other reviewers and baked it on basic / light setting and it was perfect! I did sub butter for shortening since it is all I had on hand. Thank you for sharing!!

I was worry about trying this recipe after reading the reviews and all of the modifications to the original measurements. Anyway, I followed the recipe with exact ingredients and measurements and it was delicious, it came out great, fluffy and moist. I used the 2 lb, basic option. I guess the variant in the result would be machine you are using.

This is a very good basic bread machine recipe.  I have made a few changes and am now very happy with how it is turning out.  I changed the 3 cups of whole wheat flour to 2 cups and then added 1/2 cup quinoi flour, 1/4 cup milled flaxseed and 1/4 cup kasha.  It adds more complexity to the flavours.  I reduced the honey from 1/3 cup to a scant 1/4 cup as I don't like bread to taste sweet.  I substituted olive oil for shortening as it is a healthier oil.  It does come out very dense but I don't mind that at all.  We just slice it more thinly.

Great! I don't have a bread machine so I just mix it all in a bowl and let it rise for 1 - 2 hours. I have made this several times and like to add all kind of other stuff such as oatmeal, cornmeal, flax seed meal, chia seeds, and wheat germ. I also add a half teaspoon of baking powder and/or vital wheat gluten to get it to rise properly. Great base recipe to add to!

My most favorite bread. Raised perfectly (I tried the salt in with the wet ingredients) set on whole wheat, 1.5 lb loaf, with light crust. I used butter. 
My family LOVES it, and so do I. I'll never buy bread again. :P

Tried this for my first ever bread machine loaf. Turned out GREAT! Love that it's more substantial than your typical grocery bread. Honey flavor is delicious.   I didn't have milk powder so I sub'd 1/8 c of milk and only used 1 c of water. Worked just fine.

First loaf of bread I have made in 6 years...Delicious!  My husband polished off the entire loaf in a day and a half.  I also made the bread the old fashioned way...Warm water, yeast, honey and milk powder in my mixing bowl for about 5 minutes making sure the honey was dissolved.  Added the butter, turned on my kitchen aid with dough hook attached and started adding flour...Let it go for about 10-15 minutes, sprayed a glass bowl and let the dough proof covered in plastic for about an hour...punched it down and placed it in my greased loaf pan...let it proof for another 30 minutes or so and baked in a still 350-75 degree oven until it was golden and beautiful!  YUM!!

Great every day whole wheat bread! I replaced shortening with unsalted butter and added 3 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten. I used the whole wheat setting and light crust and it came out perfect! My order for adding ingredients into the bread machine are water, butter, honey, salt, wheat flour, dry milk, vital wheat gluten, yeast. Beautiful loaf and easy to slice. If your loaf came out lopsided, it might be too dry. It takes wheat flour a little longer to absorb water. Allow it to knead for 5 minutes before deciding to add more flour.

This bread is a winner. I just started making bread and have tried 6 recipes that were O.K- but i was on a search for a good 100% whole wheat bread and this one is perfect- also convenient with so little ingredients. I omitted the dry milk powder as well, and used 1/4 cup of honey. This will be made often.

I really enjoyed this bread.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful, but I have since changed it a bit to suit my own tastes.  I omit the dry milk powder completely; instead of 1 1/2 tsp. of salt, I only use 1 tsp.; I use olive oil instead of shortening; and I have just started using 1/2 c. of raw wheat germ and 2 1/2 c. whole wheat flour instead of just 3 c. whole wheat flour.  It still tastes great, and now no dairy and no trans fats.

This is an awesome bread!  The first time I made it it was dry, but still good enough that my hubby wanted another loaf.  Both the 2nd and the 3rd loaves have been awesome!  Sweet and moist.  I did use the dough setting on my 3rd loaf and cook in my oven, as it is easier to control how dark the crust gets (it was really dark in the bread machine, even when I used the light crust setting).  Slices very well.  Goes great with soup.  If you had trouble with your first loaf try again, it is worth the time: what do you have to lose?

Best bread recipe ever!!   I think maybe some problems others have had with the recipe are because all bread machines are different.  Mine overcooks my bread. So I stop the bread machine early and put it in the oven after it has risen, at 350 for 30 minutes.  Also, make sure that your ingredients aren't cold or you may have problems with rising. Great recipe!!

Wonderful recipe. Made these changes as recommended by others: Used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups bread flour, 1 cup water, 1/8 cup milk and sprinkled honey on yeast. Warmed the milk, water and honey in microwave. The result is a delicious loaf of bread.

We loved this bread.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I have tried a few other whole wheat recipes before and either they didn't rise or I didn't like the flavour.  I prefer to bake my bread in the oven, and this recipe was perfect for that.  Even though the recipe yield is for a 1.5 lb. loaf, I divided it into two.  After rising for an hour, I baked it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes and my end result was two perfect loaves of bread.  The flavour was great and the texture was light and fluffy.  I will definately be making this my new whole wheat bread recipe and I won't be changing anything.

This bread has become a family staple.  To get a better rise, I add 3 tablespoons of wheat gluten.  And to boost the fiber, I add 1 tablespoon each of flax seed, soynuts, roasted sunflower seed kernals.  Also, butter-flavored shortening adds flavor!

This was my first successful recipe using my bread machine and I'm sticking with it.  I've since made a few adjustments.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of whole oats.  I added a tiny bit more honey, a tablespoon of sesame seed, and 2 of flax seeds.  Great fiber, and therefore a great carb for the day.

EXCELLENT!!  If I could give this more than 5 cards, I would!  My whole family loved this bread.  I substituted margarine for the shortening, and regular milk for the milk powder, and it was still outstanding.  Thank you for this recipe--it will be used many times in this house!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving since I had a bag of whole wheat flour and wanted to put it to good use. It is a delicious loaf of bread!  I did not have any powdered milk, but it was still delicious.  I made another loaf the next day just for myself.  It is really good toasted.  I think I will make some loaves to give for Christmas gifts.

I made this recipe exactly as written a few times and also with some add-ins a few times.  It turned out great each time.  Moist and flavorful.

Made this bread twice. The first time as written, and it is indeed 5 star.  The second time I took another reviewer's suggestions; I mixed 3 Tbsp. wheat gluten to the flour, used butter instead of shortening, added the salt to the water (not the flour) so as not to kill the yeast, and used setting 1 (light, white bread.) It is phenomenal!

The bread turned out even better than I'd hoped!  Per others' suggestions, I substituted 1/8 of milk and 1 cup of water for the dry milk powder and 1-1/8 cup of water.  I also replaced the shortening with olive oil.

This is the whole wheat sandwich bread you have been looking for! I have made many whole wheat breads over the years in my breadmaker, committed to making as many of my own foods as possible. They were good, but never like this. This is the soft, spongy, hearty whole wheat sandwich bread that you buy at the store. I only made 3 small changes. I added 3 T vital wheat gluten, used butter instead of shortening, and used the basic or the white setting instead of whole wheat. The bad thing is I can't tell you how long it lasts (although honey is a natural preservative) because it doesn't last long enough in my house to tell. I've made 3 loaves already this week and given the recipe to 2 friends who love it!

This is an extraordinarily delicious loaf. Made this in the Zojirushi 2lb bread maker on the 'basic wheat' setting. I adjusted the yield to 16 servings from 12 to accomodate the larger machine, used butter in place of shortening, and instead of dried milk powder, I substituted 1/2 cup of the water with whole milk.  The flour used was Daisy Flour's whole wheat Warthog bread flour.

This is one of the best breads I have ever experienced. The crust is perfectly crisp and brown, and the inside is a beautifully fine texture. The flavor is brilliant, and the bread seems absurdly versatile. Great for breakfast with a little jam, perfect for sandwiches (the sweetness of the honey is subtle enough not to overpower any toppings), and just tried it with a bit of nutella- dessert works too! Thank you for this recipe!!!

Delicious.  I followed the recipe as written but added about a handful of chopped pecans.  I used the whole wheat setting on the bread machine and stopped the baking process 10 minutes before it was going to end to keep from getting a dry product.  I will make this many more times.

This bread is great, but did not rise sufficiently in my old Panasonic bread machine. Here are some changes that make it work more consistently for me:

1 1/8 cup milk (skim or 2% works fine)
2 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all purpose white flour
1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast

Put all dry ingredients in pan, top with liquids and use the 4 hour LIGHT bake cycle.

Really good whole wheat bread. I found it a little salty, next time I would put in 1 teaspoon of salt. My bread machine made it look a little rustic. I guess just the way it mixed it up, but it still tastes good. I might add more honey next time just to make it a little sweeter. This is the first time I have made whole wheat bread in my machine.  All in all a really good whole wheat bread.

Delicious bread!  It came out nice and soft and full of flavor.  It was even good plain and had a nice sweetness to it!  This is definitely one of my favorite bread recipes now!  I did replace the shortening with butter.  But other than that, I followed the recipe.  It was great with just a little butter spread on a slice and drizzled with more honey!  So good!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I used this recipe for a homeschool science class on yeast- i only gave it one rise to make the time shorter & it turned out perfect! wow!  the only sub i made was using butter instead of shortening. *This bread lasted about 15 minutes in my house! My son yells out "who wants some more of the best bread ever?" ha!

This tastes better than the honey wheat bread you pay 4.00 a loaf for at the store.  I added the salt to the water and put the dry milk next to the yeast per my machine's manual.  Loved by the whole family!

I am somewhat new to breadmaking, and this was the third or fourth recipe I've tried.  I wanted a recipe that is healthy and uses only whole wheat flour, but that still has good texture.  I LOVE this recipe and now make it every week, and I've stopped buying bread at the store! The changes I've made are: I use butter instead of shortening I add 3TBS gluten flour for a lighter texture I add 3TBS flaxseed and some oats I use my breadmaker to knead the dough and do the first rise, then I put it in a buttered loaf pan, let it rise for another 30 minutes and then bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  (I like the shape of a loaf pan better than the square bread my machine makes.)

This turned out really good. I did a few changes, I used white whole wheat flour,by King Arthur, and reduced the honey to 2 table spoons. I took anther reviewers suggestion and baked it using the basic setting and light crust. The bread turned out nice and fluffy. Next time I think I'll reduce the salt to 1 teaspon, it seemed a little satly, but thats just me.

I replaced half water with fresh milk, since I didn't have any milk powder. I experimented with different amounts of honey. 2 tbs is the best. 
A delicious whole wheat bread. Not heavy at all.

This is the first bread recipe I have ever tried and it was so amazing. I don't have a bread machine but you really don't need one. My 2 year old son helps me and it's fun to do. I've made it about 5 times now and it gets better every time. I used butter instead of shortening and used about 1/4 cup honey instead of 1/3. I sprinkled some dry oats on top for a little something and it's just so easy, quick and delicious. Great for sandwiches and toast. I plan to never buy a loaf of bread again.

This is seriously the best and easiest whole recipe EVER!!!  First attempt fell short, I realize (like many)it was becuase my machine overcooked the loaf PLUS it does require a bit more rising time.  Last 2 loaves I proofed yeast in a cup and added to the dry ingredients and kneaded it in the machine. I let it rise in a warm bowl, punch/kneaded and let rise again.  baked at 375 for about 40 min and it was perfection. 
   I used 4.5 tbs of ground flax instead of the shortening, decreased honey t0 1/4 cup and added 4 tsp. of vital wheat gluten.
Unreal how good this is.  If your loaf did not turn out well try the above suggestions and you will NOT be disappointed.

I had nearly given up on a whole-whole wheat recipe, but this one is delicious! Like many others, I added vital wheat gluten (1 1/2 T), used butter instead of shortening and reduced the honey to 1/4C. This will be a staple at our house! Thank you for a great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe!!! Surprisingly light and airy.  I will be making this one a lot.
I did get confused about the 1/8cup part.  I don't have that measuring cup, after google i learned that 1/8cup is 2 tbs.

as suggested by others I substituted 1/2 c white for whole wheat, used white bread setting, and baked it in the oven instead of the machine.  When it came out of the oven i brushed it with butter.

I also added the following:
1 tbs vital wheat gluten
3 tablespoons lightly toasted flax seed
4 teaspoons lightly toasted sesame seeds
2 teaspoons poppy seeds
2 tbs wheat germ
5 tsp lightly toasted sunflower seeds
add a little extra(1 1/2 tbs) water to compensate.
I will add more sunflower seeds next time and add 1 tbs xtra water instead of 1 1/2

the result was a sweet, nutty, wonderful bread that i feel good about eating for all it's healthy ingredients!

This was the first bread I made with my bread machine. I thought it was very tasty. I used the dough cycle and baked it in the oven.

Delicious!  I used 1 and 1/8 cups of skim milk for the fluid because I did not have dry milk powder and someone suggested using liquid milk not realizing they only meant 1/8 of a cup. Apparently it does not matter because my bread turned out delicious.  I do not have breadmaker so warmed the milk to 130 degrees and added to dry ingredients. Let rise for 1 hour then punched down and let rise for another hour. I do not have a loaf pan so I   shaped like a loaf and baked on cookie sheet for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. It turned out great. This is my first time ever making whole wheat bread and will make again.

Thank you so much! Finally I've found a whole wheat bread that is a pleasure to eat.  I did use margarine instead of shortening, used two cups of whole wheat flour and one cup bread flour, and added 3 Tbsp of wheat gluten.

Perfect, came out beautifully on my first try, however I did take some of the other reviewer's suggestions.  Things I changed:  Butter instead of margarine, added 3T of Vital Wheat Gluten.  I also used dry buttermilk powder instead of regular dry milk and added 1/8 c. Splenda brown sugar sweetener instead of honey and added 1/4 c. more water.  My bread machine makes a heavy crust, so I used the dough setting to make this bread, put it into a greased bread pan in the oven and let it rise for 45 min.  Then baked for 30 min at 350 degrees.  The loaf was high and the crust thin and sweet.  I brushed the top crust with butter after it came out so that it was soft.  Yum!

I received my very first bread machine today and this was the first recipe I tried. I've never been successful making yeast breads/rolls, so I was hoping a bread machine would help by doing the tricky part. What a success! I love whole wheat bread and this is excellent! It's very soft and fluffy. The crust is thin and crisp. This is excellent sandwich bread. I followed the directions exactly but added 3T of vital wheat gluten.  It's so great to have a tasty authentic whole wheat bread, as in it's made with 100% whole wheat flour. I will make this again and again.

Excellent! This is my new whole wheat recipe! I was looking for this exactly. I changed a few things: used 1 C water and 1/8 C milk (as other reviewers had suggested), used 2 C whole wheat flour and 1 C whole wheat pastry flour, used low-fat margarine in place of the shortening and also added 1 T of vital wheat gluten. This bread is so excellent--even plain.

This is my default wheat bread recipe, thank you, Melinda!  I followed some other reviewers' advice and use 1/8 C milk, reducing the water to 1 C, and I use 2 C of whole wheat flour and 1 C of either whitewheat or regular bread flour.

I have been using recipes from this site for a several years now and this is my first review to give (sorry!). I have 3 young ones 5 and under and usually go on this site for a quick "ingredient" search.  I made this bread last night and it was awsome!  I did use 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour to ease my way into making a whole wheat bread to see if my kids would eat it.  They have devoured it this morning.  Next time I will use all wheat flour and I'm sure it will be just as yummy as well as healthier.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Delicious! First time I made it in the bread machine with 1/2 cup bread flour and 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. I set the machine on wheat, which allows for an hour for the flour to sit in the fluid and soften up - I got a very light loaf. The whole family enjoyed it. I made another loaf using all white whole wheat flour (King Arthur brand) and just setting the machine on dough, baked it in a stone loaf pan. This came out wonderfully as well. I'm going to use this as my standard recipe from this point on. Makes excellent toast, sandwiches, everything!

This is really good bread. Anyone used to sandwich wheat bread will think this is too dense.  However!! This is so much better for you.  The first time I made this I used my Whole Wheat setting.  It made the crust way too dark.  If you like a light crust use the light white setting.  This is definitely going to be my new bread recipe.

I bought my first Bread Machine yesterday! Tried the 'basic' recipe first, which was okay, then tried Melinda's Whole Wheat Honey Bread (setting it to be ready for when the family woke up). All we can say is WOW!! The result was far superior to shop-bought equivalents! I am due to visit my parents tomorrow, and plan to take them a loaf (or 3)!!

My rating should not really count because the bread turned out like all my other breads - the top of it looks like a craggy rock and is about as heavy.  When it started to mix it was very dry so I added some more warm water.  My temperature of the water when I started was about 80 degrees.  I only added 1/4 cup of honey because some had said it was too sweet, other than that I followed the recipe. I spoon dipped my flour, the dry milk was leveled off - if I didn't measure the salt exactly or the honey exactly it couldn't have been off more than 1/16 of something.  Very minute.  Wet stuff in the bottom, dry on top (yeast in the little hole you make in the middle of the dry ingredients).  I also added a Tbsp of gluten (1 T. to a lb of bread - I made the 1 1/2 lbs. Should I try mixing the water and yeast together and putting it in the bottom then the dry?  I am always able to do a box mix - turns out great everytime, but doing it with other recipes - forget it.  I would really like to try this recipe again, but I've thrown out so many that it almost seems not worth it. I have a bread maker that makes a bread shape loaf.  In reading other reviews, others have added or decreased items, and theirs turned out fine.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

This bread is the BOMB! I have made it several times and have had to bulk purchase honey at Costco to keep up with demand.  The bread begs for a great cinnamon-honey butter like you get from the famous Texas steakhouse, so make that clone recipe at the same time to have an incredibly foodgasmic experience.  I have also used this as a base recipe to add spent beer brewing grains (about a cup to the dough at the end) for a bit of nutrition and nuttiness. This recipe is a keeper, for sure! Love it!

Really good recipe, I made the dough in my bread machine, but after the punch down I did the final proof in the oven then baked at 350 for 35 mins.  I baked I. The oven instead because the recipe didn't indicate what size loaf this is n my machine is either 1.5 or 2.5 lb loaf n also, I hate that the bread maker makes such a tall in height but short in length loaf

Excellent tasting bread - I did decrease the amount of honey to 1/4 cup, but that's a personal preference. I find I cannot do without Vital wheat gluten - or the bread will be dense. My children love to have this right out of the bread machine with butter.

We make this bread every week! We love it for sandwiches, or toasting for breakfast. The first few times I made it, it was doughy in the middle; it may be because I live in a humid environment. Reducing the water to 1 cup did the trick. Perfect every time!

This is a great and easy whole-wheat bread! I did slightly modify the recipe, but this is something I do to all breads I make, manual or machine. First, I add 1 Tbl vital wheat gluten (I see some people here doing more, but I'm usually OK with this). Additionally, I replaced 1 Tbl water with 1 Tbl vinegar (so I used 1 cup + 1 Tbl water and 1 Tbl vinegar). I think this helps makes it softer and chewier. I also manually shape the loaf and remove the paddle right before the last rise cycle (my machine notifies me of this and allows me to do it, as do many). This ensures a good, even loaf shape and just a little hole in the bottom instead of a big hole for the paddle (which I still get even though my machine has a collapsible paddle).

My only issue is that the crust seems to be a bit thick, but that's a pretty common issue with all machine breads for me, so I think it's just something about how breadmakers work. Perhaps the "light crust" setting on my machine would help.

I usually prefer to use the machine to mix and knead the dough then shape and bake in my own loaf pan in the oven, so that's probably what I'll do in the future (at least once the weather cools down!). I imagine I'd get even better results this way, but I wanted to try the whole thing in the machine (minus slight intervention on my part) just to see how it works--and that is quite well!

This bread was wonderfully moist.  I took the advice of a couple of others who baked this bread by using 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup bread flour.  I also made sure the temp. of the water was 120 degrees, and I put in on the light crust, white bread cycle for the 1.5 pound loaf.  It is perfect.  My kids eat it like they've never had fresh bread before!  The crust is not too crunchy, and the bread is not too dense, as would be the case if I used all 3 cups of whole wheat flour as the recipe called for.

This was super tasty and not at all without flavour. In fact it was a million times better than a lot of recipes I've made. The only thing I wasn't sure about was that it sunk a bit after it came out of the breadmaker. It looked beautiful when it came out though and tasted amazing. I'm not sure if it was me or the recipe, or my breadmaker that caused the sinkage...I did put it on a timer overnight, so that could be it. All in all a fantastic whole wheat bread recipe. This will be my staple recipe now. Thanks!

This bread is the best wheat bread I've made in a very long time. It's heavier than white bread, obviously, but considering I used 100% whole wheat flour, it's a nice light(er) wheat bread. I did use vital wheat gluten, as some other reviewers suggested, and I think that's what gave the bread it's lighter texture. I also used butter instead of shortening. Excellent flavor, too. I don't have a bread machine, so I used my cusinart, putting in the dry ingredients, then adding the wet while the machine was running. I did soften the yeast in the water first. I had powdered buttermilk on the counter while I was working, so I just used that in place of regular powdered milk. Fantastic 100% whole wheat bread!

This is very good bread.  I make this once a week and learned to weigh my shortening at 0.65 on my food scale.  It's easier for me then getting it off measuring spoons.  I use one cup of bread flour and 2 cups of whole wheat when kids visit, it's more like what they buy at  the store and they finish off a loaf and want more.  So simple to make will let them make a loaf next time they visit.

Wonderful!  I used 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup almond milk instead of the dry milk powder and substituted coconut oil for the shortening.

Made this on Sunday after I forgot to pick up my usual loaf at the grocery store.  I substituted butter for shortening but otherwise stuck to the directions.  I measured the ingredients into my bread machine, selecting the whole wheat setting with the light crust option.  Less than four hours later, the bread was done.  It is delicious--light textured and honey sweet.  My kids beg for it and even my picky husband said it was the best bread-machine bread he's ever tasted.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Who needs grocery store bread when it's this easy at home?

I love the fact that this bread is 100% whole wheat. I make it by hand and knead 5-10 minutes before the first rise. I bake it in a loaf pan at around 350F for 30 minutes. It tastes GREAT and has a nice texture.

A very good recipe - I just got my bread machine and I'm still figuring out how perfect bread should turn out! Bread had a nice wheat taste - maybe more honey next time?

I've made this bread many times. It's a family favorite. The bread machine makes it so simple. Sometimes I'll mix the whole wheat flour with bread flour at either half and half or 2 c wheat, 1 c bread. Both are good. I've never used the milk powder since I don't keep it on hand. Anyhow, if you're looking for a good wheat bread, this is it. You'll not be disappointed.

Not sure if it was the recipe, me or the machine, but it came out dense and brick-like. The wheat flour did not rise at all. Will not be making again.

This is the best bread machine recipe I have made so far.  I accidentally forgot to put the shortening and it still came out very good. It has a crispy crust and is moist inside.  Very good.

Very enjoyable bread. The honey was just right and gave it a little sweet taste with the wheat flour. My grandchild said this was the best and asked to take the loaf home.

We love this!  It is great for a 100% whole wheat bread.  The only thing I do differently is substitute butter for the shortening and add about 4 tsp of gluten.

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe I have made in 10+ years!  I grind wheat berries into flour which makes most bread very healthy but dense.  Not with this recipe.  I 1-1/2 times the recipe instead of doubled for my bread maker.  I used half hard red wheat and half hard white wheat, olive oil in place of shortening and 3 teaspoons of yeast.  We love it!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!  Update:  Still lovin' it!  I added more honey, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 cup of raisins for raisin bread.

This recipe is worth TEN STARS!!!  I'm fairly new to the whole bread-making thing, but so far, this is absolutely the best bread I've ever made and tasted.  The bread had a great soft texture on the inside, and just the right crust on the outside.  I loved the slight sweetness that the honey provided.  I used 1 Tbs. regular milk in place of the dry milk so I just put in one less Tbs. water to compensate.  Absolutely delicious!!  Thanks, MELH!

This bread turned out fantastic! ... with the addition of 3 TBS of vital wheat gluten. Definitely will be included in the rotation :)  I just used the dough setting on the bread machine, punched down and let rise for another hour.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  I hate the crust and the holes you get when baked in the machine.

This is now our standard bread recipe for sandwiches .  It is fantastic and forgiving.  I usually follow the recipe exactly (except use butter instead of shortening) but I've also used canola oil, omitted the milk powder and used 1/8c milk instead of water and I never check the temp of the water.

***** I added 3 T. gluten and used my bread machine thru 1st rise. Put in loaf pan to rise again and finished in a 350 oven for 30 minutes. A great bread that was light in texture and stayed soft for a few days...

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make this bread. I proofed the yeast with the hot water and honey for ten minutes, just used a wisk to combine all ingredients. When the yeast was ready, I added the melted butter and all the dry ingredients. It took another 1/4 c. of flour to get the dough to jump on the hook. After that, I let the hook knead it for about five minutes. I did a double rise, once in a greased bowl for an hour and once in the loaf pan for about a half hour. It didn't rise much, but I've come to expect that with breads made with honey. I think it was a good bread, though a little salty. I liked the chewy texture, as did my family. If I make it again, I'd cut the salt in half.

One of the best loaves of bread I've ever made in my bread machine over the past 5 years or so!  Light and sweet; excellent recipe!  I didn't think whole wheat breads could come out this light and soft.  I substituted about 1/2 c of regular flour for some of the whole wheat flour because I thought it would make it lighter and more enticing to my (picky) son, but I don't think I needed to do that anyway.    Bread machine settings I used:  1 to 1.5 lb loaf, whole wheat, light crust.

Since I don't have a bread machine, I had to piece together from the reviews how to bake this wonderful, dense bread.  It gives us a good alternative bread for breakfast!  I baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes or so, but I think next time I'll try 350.  I used two tablespoons of vital gluten, but next time I will add one more and maybe a little more yeast.

I've tried numerous times to bake a loaf of bread my husband likes, and never succeeded...until this recipe.  Not five minutes ago he spontaneously emailed me to tell me how much he liked this bread recipe.  I've never known him do something like that before.  WOW!  This bread is very moist, which is exactly what we were looking for.  I did add vital wheat gluten.  Delish! =)

Of the several recipes I have tried in my bread machine, this is the one I keep coming back to.  The flavor and texture are just perfect.  I don't ever have powdered milk on hand so I just use about 1Tbsp of regular milk in place of 1Tbsp water.

I will give this 5 stars because it turned out fab in my machine!  Baked it on wheat setting and light crust.  Perfect!  I personally thought it was to sweet, so next time I will half the honey added.  I did use butter instead of shortning.  Best wheat recipe I have tried yet!

Wow.  This is great!  I was searching for a cheaper alternative to the Great Harvest Honey breads ($6 for a 2lb loaf) and I think this will work JUST fine for us.  I had to drop the yeast to 1tsp for altitude purposes (we're up high) and added another good squeeze of honey, just because...I also added the salt to the water (thanks for the tip!) and used butter instead of shortening.  I noticed it was awfully wet looking the first go 'round with kneading, so I sprinkled a generous tablespoon of flour in there.  Don't know if it would have been fine, but it sure is delicious now.  This is a keeper, for sure!!

WOW! I just moved to Utah from Kentucky and my old standard wheat bread recipes was not working for me.  This is fantastic.  Very moist and delicious flavor.  It did take and hour and a half to rise.  I almost gave up hope.  but it made it.  
i also followed tip of wrapping it in a towl while hot and waited 4 it to cool before cutting to trap moisture.
I made a snafu and apparantly didn't grease the pan.  The loaf broke in half trying to get it out.  None the less it was delicious!

This bread recipe was very easy to make.  I didn't have dry milk so I skipped it and I also didn't add the shortening.  I did add 3 T. of vital wheat gluten. Sometimes I have trouble with whole wheat recipes in the bread machine because they don't rise enough and end up being too hard and dense, this loaf had good flavor and texture and rose nicely.

We loved this bread. Delicious flavour,..best whole wheat bread we've tried. Not too sweet, tender. The crust was a little too dark (set on light crust) so next time I will take another reviewer's advice and set to "white" cycle. Delicious!!

This is an excellent whole wheat bread recipe. I forgot to add the dry milk powder but the results were still excellent.  It had a great light texture and nice taste.  I can't wait to make this bread again.

After reading the helpful hints from others, I have been using this recipe for the last 7 months.  I have made it for friends (even Christmas gifts) and family members.  We all have enjoyed it - with many, many compliments.  The 3 things I have changed:  substitue 1 cup white bread flour for 1 cup wheat flour.  Mix 1 tablespoon wheat gluten in with the flour, per batch.  Butter instead of shortening.  I use room temperature ingredients.  We prefer a lighter bread, so I set the bread machine on the "dough/pasta" setting.  When it stops, I knead the dough on a floured area, just enough to get the air out.  Then place it in a greased bread pan.  When risen, cook at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  If it starts to get too brown on top, I cover it with a piece of aluminum foil.  This is an excellent, tasty, healthy recipe.  Many thanks, Melinda, for submitting it!!

really good I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked it on the regular bread setting and it came out much better than using the whole wheat setting.

I was skeptical about this since it uses 100% whole wheat flour and I thought it would be dense, but this bread is delicious! It's just out of the oven and I can't stop eating it. It's like cake! I hope it also tastes as good once it has cooled. I omitted the milk powder since I didn't have any and it still came out great! I didn't even need to mix all dry ingredients (but salt)separately as another reviewer recommended... Definitely a great loaf to try!

It was ok. My 7yo son LOVES it! I used real milk instead of powder (1/8 cup) butter instead of shortening. Next time I will use more honey. Not sweet enough for me. My son had two THICK slices and begged for more. lol I guess that means it is a keeper!

So Good! I used the dough setting in my machine (Breadman)and let it rise in the machine for about 45 more minutes after the machine was done. Then I put it in a bread pan and put it in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes. Came out great. I have never had 100% whole wheat bread that tasted so good before. Also, this is the first breadmaker bread that I have made that didn't have that 'breadmaker' taste.

The reviews don't lie - this is a great recipe!  I make it every week and have stopped buying bread at the store.  I realized that my bread machine overcooks everything, so based on other reviewer's suggestions, I make the dough in the machine, let it rise, and then bake at 350 for 40 minutes or so.  The result is a sweet, tasty bread with a light crust that can be sliced for sandwiches (something I never got with my bread machine).  I have made it by hand too, just so that I can make more than one loaf at a time.  I leave out the milk powder, and have used milk, rice milk, or just water for the liquid and they all worked well.  I don't use shortening but butter or olive oil will the give the bread another hint of flavor.  I am so glad I found this recipe so that my family can enjoy homemade bread all the time!

I have made this bread twice now within a day, because the first loaf was gone in a snap...I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  The ingredients are in the right proportion, no adding flour or liquids were necessary for me.  I also really like that it is a true whole wheat bread not a half and half.  I used margarine/butter in place of the shortening, but followed the recipe in every other aspect.  I recommend this recipe if you want a great whole wheat bread that tastes wonderful.  Now I am off to bake another loaf...

OMG. This was absolutely delicious! I've had the worst time finding a whole wheat recipe that was as light and soft as store bought bread, and I finally found it! I decided to follow the directions exactly rather than the suggestions from other reviewers, and it came out perfect. It's not too dense, chewy, and has a great flavor. I cooked it on the  light crust setting, and it still came out dark and crisp, but delicious. Thanks!

Excellent bread, easy to prepare.  I have made it both with 100% whole wheat flour, and also with 2cups whole wheat, 1 cup bread flower.  It turns out grea both ways.  Last time that I made this I did the dough cycle and formed them into  hogie size buns, brushed them with egg whites and did 1/2 poppy seeds, and 1/2 of them with sesame seeds.  They were great for sandwiches.  I will probably be using this recipe on a weekly basis.  Almost forgot -- I add two TBSP Gluten.

the bread tasted good, but for some reason it didn't rise well and was extremely dense.  maybe next time i will try 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 whole wheat. i wonder if the problem was the 'stone ground' whole wheat flour.

This is so good.  We just had a warm piece with butter right out of the oven.  I used my bread machine for the dough and then put it in a loaf pan, let it double and baked it in the oven 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  Yummy!

I personally think this is a very good w/w bread recipe. Especially for using all w/w flour! I've made it a few times using the lightest wheat bread setting and we really like it. I would also like to try it using some sunflower seeds because we like nuts and seeds in our bread. Thanks.

A good baseline w/w bread. I preferred it mixed in the machine but baked in a loaf for about 30 min. @ 350. Easily tweaked. Worked well with molasses, also with maple syrup.

I don't have a bread machine so I mix all of the dry ingredients then add the honey, butter or olive oil instead of shortening, and add the water last at about 125-130 degrees.  The bread is awesome - soft and light for WW bread!  I have also tried substituting the honey w/ brown sugar and also with maple syrup.  Sometimes I add 3/4c. oatmeal.  You just can't go wrong w/ this!  It's yummy every time.  I bake at 350 for 35 minutes.

Excellent recipe. I only used the dough cycle and baked the bread in the oven. I used 2 cups ww flour and 1 cup of bread flour. Butter instead of shortening, maple syrup instead of honey and only 1 tsp salt.
I will definetely make this again.

I tried this recipe last night and it is great!!! I did adapt a few things just for the heck of it and it still came out very well. It is a very versatile recipe. I left out the milk powder. I used 1/4 brown sugar b/c I was out of honey. I used 2 cups of spelt flour with 1 cup of whole wheat. The texture is awesome. It rose well, baked well and I will use it as the basis for my whole grain breads from now on.

This is my standby bread...I always make it with butter instead of shortening, and it turns out lovely.

Last time I added a couple tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce and the bread was even moister, yum.

This was the first loaf of bread that I made in my bread machine and we loved it.  I used rapid rise yeast so I used the rapid cycle but then had to extend the rise time so next time I'll just use the regular wheat setting.  We are planning to use this as our everyday bread but I'm going to try to reduce the honey a little as it is a little sweet and my husband is diabetic.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a family favorite! I have changed the recipe a little by using 1 1/2 cups bread flour and 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour to make a total of 3 cups flour. This makes it light enough for the kids to eat. Mine also needs a little more flour added at the kneading stage so it's not too wet. It comes out great every time! You can't mess this one up!

Very easy to make.  Great texture.  However, I found the honey flavor to be overwhelming.  Maybe using half the recommended amount would help.

This is terrific bread.  I doubled the recipe added everything to my breadmaker and just before the second rise I took out the dough, divided it, placed it in two bread pans let it double in size and baked them in my oven at 425 for 20 minutes.  They came out fantastic!

This is a great recipe. I substituted soymilk for the powdered milk. Great texture, not as dense as some whole wheat flour breads. Makes a great toast or warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds with a touch of butter.

Note to self: Never use a 1 1/2 pound loaf recipe for a 1 pound loaf braed machine.

Other than that, the bread came out fine. Not as sweet as I had expected, but nonetheless fairly tasty.

Best whole wheat recipe I have found, with a couple of modifications I made to use ingredients I had on hand. Since I don't keep powdered milk, I just used half each of water and regular milk. Also subbed butter instead of shortening. Yum!!!! One day I found myself short of enough honey, so used molasses in place of half the honey--delicious! Also have started adding about a half cup of Bob's Red Mill 10 grain cereal with the flour for a little extra texture. Can't go wrong with this recipe, as written or modified to taste!

We love this! I made a couple of changes to make it a little bit lighter for my family. I did half bread flour and half wheat flour and also used margarine instead of shortening. We do it on the basic setting on our machine and it turns out great every time. Thanks!

I had tried several bread recipes and failed.  This one was the best and tasted the best!! It is our favorite and will continue to make it.  Becuase I had failures with other breads, I added 2 Tablespoons of gluten.  I only had rapid yeast so I had to change to 1 1/8 teaspoon.  It was so moist.  I am not a baker.  This was perfect for me.

This recipe is excellent.  The only changes that I have made is to use 2 Tablespoons each of honey and molassas instead of all honey. I also use butter instead of shortening but will soon try using applesauce instead.  This makes a very tasty loaf of whole wheat bread.

This was delicous. I followed other reviewers recommendations. Butter, real milk and I did 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 bread flour. Set on the lightest crust setting and the white bread setting instead of the wheat. I'm going to try my best to save some for my hubby : )

This was my second bread machine attempt, and it turned out great! I didn't have shortening, so I substituted butter. I also used organic,  sprouted whole wheat flour. This is a hearty and VERY filling bread. At 12 servings, it is 4 weight watchers points per slice. For sandwiches, be sure to slice it thin, or just use one slice and cut it in half.

This is my go to bread recipe. I've tried many and this is the one I always go back to. A few things I do for personal preference. I use 2 cups of white bread flour and one cup of whole wheat. We just aren't crazy about the texure or taste of whole wheat. I also sub coconut oil for the shortening. It gives a light sweetness as well as being a healthier option. Other than that I do add the salt to the liquids and bake using the white and light bread settings as suggested here. I haven't tried the other cycles as this works just fine. - cheryl

This bread is wonderful. I have been making it 2-3 times per week for the last few weeks. All three of my boys love it, even the one who usually gives his bread to the dogs. It is soft enough to use for sandwiches but flavorful enough to eat alone.

I don't keep dry milk or shortening in my kitchen, so I use 1C water + 1/8C skim milk as well as olive oil in place of shortening. If your bread is too dense, you probably used too much flour. The texture comes out best if you weigh out your flour instead of measuring by volume. Right now (winter in Minnesota) 375g is perfect.  In humid weather the weight of flour needed will increase slightly.

My friend gave me her breadmaker that she no longer used, and we're in heaven!  This recipe is the first one that I tried... so yummy!  I made a few changes to make it dairy free...I used Earth Balance stick margarine instead of shortening or butter, and used 3/4 cup water with 3/8 cup soy milk, warmed to about 80 degrees in the microwave. (Instead of the milk powder.) I also added a little vital wheat gluten for better rising, about 2 tsp, but you could probably add more.  I adapted the recipe for a 1 and 1/2 lb. loaf, so your measurements might be a little different.  I used the whole wheat setting with a medium crust, and it has ocme out perfectly every time!

I've made this bread countless times. It is fantastic! Now I'm an old retired guy so if I can't tinker in the shop I go to the kitchen. I tried cutting the honey to 1/4 cup and caught H for that so back to 1/3 cup, as I always say I may be crazy but I'm not stupid. I divided the flour between whole wheat and white whole wheat, I've used butter flavored crisco and also I can't believe its not butter, Recently added 1/4 cup wheat germ. I have only used 1 Tbsp of gluten per recipe but will try up to 3 in the next. My machine which I picked up at Goodwill has a whole wheat setting but the timer just counts down, maybe it need to add a crust setting? I knead on the dough setting, proof in a greased loaf pan and bake at 350 for 35 min. The result looks great and tastes great. All are happy in the Kingdom! Dale

I just got my bread machine.  The first loaf of was the whole wheat recipe out of the instruction manual.  It was a small, hard brick.  It then made a white loaf that turned out really tall, but had a weird texture.  Then, I tried this recipe.  It was PERFECT!!!  The crust was thin and not hard and crunchy like the others.  It is moist and has a great honey wheat flavor.  The height was perfect and will make slices similar to bought bread.  I think this will be our go-to bread recipe.  Thanks so much for posting.

This is REALLY good. It's very moist and dense. It did fall a little bit, but it was still crazy delicious. The only thing I changed the second time is I put half the honey so it wasn't so sweet. With that little adjustment I think I am going to have a new staple in the kitchen.

Delicious bread that worked well in the bread machine.  I used 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour and two cups stone ground whole wheat flour, butter for shortening, almond milk instead of the water plus milk powder, and about 1 tablespoon of maple syrup included in the 1/3 cup of honey ( I ran out of honey).  The recipe was forgiving of these tweeks and we woke up to the inviting smell of fresh bread.

I recently found this recipe and am making it for the 3rd time this month. It's absolutely delicious and so simple! I use the 3 Tbls gluten, olive oil for the shortening, and light crust and basic setting as suggested. I usually have to add a bit more flour as the dough is sticky after the first kneading, but that's easy to do. This is my favorite bread right now. Thanks for this great recipe!

I subbed shortening with olive oil, but otherwise made as written, using the Basic setting on my bread machine rather than WW, per other reviewers. I had a little trouble slicing it evenly but that is more my fault than the bread's as I don't own a great bread knife or a slicing guide. Texture is excellent, nice and moist but dense at the same time. Will try cutting honey back to 1/4 c next time as it was just a tad sweet for our tastes.

This bread turns out perfectly every time.  I grind my own hard wheat and add 1 Tbsp of wheat gluten to the recipe.  I have also added sunflower seeds and the family loves it.

This bread was awesome!! It came out perfectly in my bread machine. I also added a handful of wheat bran with the flour. We had some with dinner tonight and it's moist, flavorful and so good. Definitely a keeper!!
Thank you for sharing.

I followed this recipe except for using butter for the shortening.  Some whole wheat recipes can be either super dry and dense or just too light and insubstantial ~ this one struck a perfect balance. I found it to be moist, tender and light but with just the right balance of heartiness. The honey gives it just a touch of sweetness and great color. It's great toasted and for sandwiches.

The best whole wheat dough I've made yet! My bread machine does not have a ww dough cycle, so I kneaded it a bit longer and let it rise for longer as well. Fantastic!

The bread was delicious, but unfortunately no one was there to remove the bread from the bread machine when it had finished baking. The whole loaf sunk into a dense  block. It was still moist and had a great honey taste! I used oil instead of shortening and  1 Tbsp milk + 1 c. water + 1 Tbsp. water instead of the milk powder and water. The yeast was also a 2.25 tsp package, I think.

Wow! Made this yesterday and it's almost gone. This is by far the best whole wheat bread I've found for the bread machine. The texture is amazingly soft and even. The flavor is sweet and full. It will be a weekly staple in our house.

This bread is delicious!  I did not care for the wheat bread recipe that came with my bread maker so I tried this one.  I followed Michelle from Manitoba's suggestions and took out 1 TBL of flour for each cup and replaced it with vital wheat gluten.  I added the salt to the water, halved the honey, used butter instead of shortening, and used yeast for bread-makers. I also made a couple of high-altitude adjustments since I live in Colorado.  According to the direction for my bread maker, I reduced the water by 2 tsp, and the yeast by 1/4 of a tsp.  I cooked on the wheat and light setting.  The bread was light and the crust nice and crispy.  I will definitely be making this regularly.

Love this recipe & so does my whole family including my finicky 2 year old.  I made some adjustments and substituted dry GOAT'S milk for the regular milk and coconut oil for the shortening and it turned out great.  I also added the wet ingredients first, but included the salt with that as others indicated.  I heated up the water until almost boiling before adding it to the machine, and that seemed to do the trick getting the yeast to rise because it did so nicely.  I used the Basic and Light settings on the bread machine and it turned out a beautiful golden brown on the outside while tender on the inside.  I really wouldn't change anything other than possibly more honey if you want a sweeter more dessert-like bread.

I'm new to bread making in the bread machine...but to me this recipe was very good. Like reviewers suggested I put my machine on Basic instead of whole wheat. I also programmed it to "Light". I added the salt w/ the wet ingredients which I added first and also substituted the dry milk w/ an 1/8 cup of regular milk. Bread was fairly dense but quite moist and I enjoyed the slightly sweeter flavor.

I was looking for a whole wheat recipe that is not as dense and heavy as the one in my bread machine's cookbook, and this fit the bill perfectly.  The loaf came out looking and smelling beautiful, and when I took it out of the pan it felt so light and perfect.  A warm piece with butter on it confirmed that this is my new every day recipe.  I will probably make it twice a week b/c it will get eaten so quickly around here.  Thank you for this wonderful bread!

I read most of the reviews before trying this recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I made sure that the salt didn't kill the yeast.  I could not add the vital wheat gluten because I did not have any, but I would certainly try it in other recipes in the future.  As for this recipe, I am not a fan.  It is too, too sweet.  I did not enjoy the flavor at all.  Not to burst anyone's bubble, but this bread is not as healthy as some of the reviewers are making it out to be.  It is nutritionally the same as white bread because the grains of wheat have already been ground (into flour) rather than left whole.  Until I can find a decent recipe for whole grain bread, I think I will stick with my store-bought Ezekiel bread.

This bread was beyond yummy and moist and sweet. The most delicious wheat bread I have made. However, 3 cups of flour was definitely not enough. I had to increase it to 4 cups. This may be due to the fact that I was using home milled fresh flour but just be aware to check your dough during the first kneading to see if it is too wet. If it's soupy, it's too wet;)

Hearty, healthy, delicious bread! This is great if you're looking for those three attributes... it's not for everyone, as it's pretty dense. I wanted homemade bread (I've been on a bread-making kick the last few months) that was nutritious and this fit the bill! It reminds me of Brownberry or even Ezekiel bread. I made this by hand and found it to be quite sticky...so much honey! Excuse me while I go slice myself another piece... :)

This has become my go to recipe for sandwich bread.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I added 3 tablespoons wheat gluten, use butter instead of the shortening, and I substitute 1 cup of bread flour and 2 cups of white whole wheat.  It bakes up super fluffy, and wrapped in foil, it stays soft for days.

Very nice loaf! It might be because of the humidity in the summer, but I needed to add a fair amount of extra flour. I used gluten as well at 1 tsp/cup.

I have made this bread several times now and it always turns out well. I made it according to the recipe with the exception of using margarine rather than shortening. I take it out of the bread machine on the last rise and put it in my Pampered Chef stoneware loaf pan, let it rise again and bake for the 30 minutes. Will make again.

I just recently got my bread machine, and have been looking for a good whole wheat bread recipe. I decided to give this one a try because it is one of the few recipes that doesn't include refined flour, and of course because of the good reviews.  Of all the breads I tried so far, this was by far the best. I only made two changes. For one, I replaced two tablespoons of the honey with sugar. I mixed the water, yeast and sugar in the machine and let it get bubbly for about 10 minutes before I added the rest of the ingredients - I find that all breads rise better that way. I also used butter instead of shortening to make it healthier and more natural. Then I baked it in the whole wheat setting with light crust. The bread turned out perfect: Crispy perfect crust, incredibly moist inside, very nice texture, and it rose perfectly.   Next time, I will try to add some flax seed and sunflower seeds, and I'm probably going to reduce the amount of honey by half, because it ended up being just a tad too sweet for my taste. It is a great recipe for a truly healthy bread as it is, and also a great base recipe to play with and add other healthy ingredients.

I did substitute butter for the shortening.I also used one cup Bread flour and two cups wheat flour, so it would be less dense. I didn't have the dry milk so I too used 1 cup water 1/8 cup milk. I use the Basic setting, with light crust. It was wonderful dryed in the oven and mixed with my fresh white bread in my homemade suffing.

This is my first bread in my brand new bread machine!  It turned out REALLY good, but next time definitely need to keep the crust on "light".  I took a few suggestions from the reviewers.  Replaced shortening with butter, and subbed in one cup of bread flour.  The texture was awesome!!  The only issue I had is that my new bread machine has size settings.  I set mine for large (2lbs), but think it will come out much better - crust wise with the medium setting.    Thank you.  This was my first successful attempt at bread making!

I made slight changes that were suggested by some other members. I don't have a mixer or a bread machine so I proofed the yeast first in 1 cup water, 1/8 skim milk and sugar. After it became foamy, I added the remaining ingredients except the flour and added the flour once all the other ingredients were dissolved. I baked for 1/2hr at 350F and brushed melted butter on it after I pulled it out of the oven. It's so tasty when served warm with butter! I like that it tastes a little sweet from the honey. I served mine with slowcooked chili. I've made this bread a few times and will make it again for sure!

I used 1 1/8 c. soy milk instead of the milk powder and water. Light olive oil is the shortening I chose which worked fine. My whole family loves waking up to fresh bread for breakfast and this is a good one.

This is excellent! It is my husband's favorite and far better than steakhouse wheat bread. I go a little heavier on the honey than the recipe calls for- just our taste, 'cause this is perfect as is. This last time, though, I used molasses in place of the honey - you wanna talk hearty, earthy, warm-the- soul goodness, or what?

I love this recipe.  I've been making lots of whole wheat breads lately and for sandwiches, this is the best bread.  I did alter the recipe a little bit, though.  It's great, don't get me wrong...but for deli sandwiches, it's just a bit too sweet.  So, when I make this bread for sandwiches, I triple this recipe to make 3 loaves and only use 1/3 C honey and add 2/3 C water more.  I also add 1 1/2 T wheat gluten per C whole wheat flour.  It's wonderful...give it a try!

I love this recipe and make it at least once a week. We've stopped buying bread at the grocery store altogether. This is especially great for sandwiches and will cut into thin slices well.  My only changes are to use 1/8 cup skim milk instead of the milk powder and 2 tbsp of canola oil in place of the shortening.

I'm somewhat new to bread making and have been enjoying my WellBuilt breadmaker for about one and a half years. I love 100% whole wheat bread and have tried a number of recipes... all flopped, either because I didn't add wheat gluten, or, for some other unknown reason.  I decided to try this bread (only because so many people rated it) and I made it just the way it is written except: I used butter instead of shortening, and I used 2 tsp of yeast instead of 1 1/2 tsp (I was afraid it wouldn't rise).  It came out wonderful!  It rose high (not over the top of the pan) with a well rounded top, and a flavor that can't be beat.  I'm making my second loaf right now to freeze! Maybe I'll make another tomorrow!

I use the light crust setting on the bread machine.  I also added 3 T. wheat gluten as suggested, substituted butter for shortening.  I used 1 cup bread flour and 2 cups w/w flour for a less dense bread.  This is a delicious bread.  I have made it several times now and we always enjoy it.  Made it for my visiting family and they (picky grandchildren and all) loved it.

Awesome! I can't believe I haven't rated this yet. I make this ALL the time, it's my mom's all-time favorite. My family only eats whole grains, and it's hard to find a really hearty, tasty whole wheat bread in the supermarket. With a recipe this easy, who wants store-bought bread?!? :]

I give this recipe only 4 stars because there are some key steps missing.  For example, how big of a loaf is it?  I had to make it 3 times before I figured out I should select the smallest loaf size on my Cuisinart bread machine (I too used the basic white bread option and lightest crust).  Also, be sure to mix the dry milk and water.  Maybe that's a standard step when using dry milk, but to a newbie bread baker like myself it't not obvious. The last time I made this I accidentally added an extra TBSP of butter.  It was alot more moist and will keep making it that way.

Now, I am making this for the third time. It is THE BEST bread ever. The second time, it didn't raise as well as it should for some reasons, (maybe, the yeast was bit old, I am guessing) but still the bread tasted super! My husband loved it so much. It is really the best!! Thanks!!

This bread recipe is great.  I've been looking for a soft, whole wheat bread recipe for my bread machine for a few weeks and all that I had tried so far were too dry and heavy.  Not so with this one!  It was very soft, light and sweet!  I did change it a bit -- my son is allergic to dairy so I left out the dry milk powder and I didn't even notice the omission.  I also used 2 Tbsp of canola oil instead of the shortening because we try to avoid partially-hydrogenated oils (trans fats) at all costs.  I would have substituted it with butter but couldn't because of the dairy issue.  Canola oil worked great.  I also substituted 1 cup of bread flour/2 cups of ww flour for the 3 cups of ww flour to make it a bit lighter.  All in all, this recipe was great (we finished the loaf in one day)and I will continue to make it for my family.  Thanks to MELH for submitting this recipe!!

This is great.  I didn't have powdered milk so I substitued 1 T. of regular milk.  Also, made this on the dough setting, let it rise for 1 hr. and then baked it in the oven at 375 for about 25 minutes.  Next time I think I'll let it bake a bit longer.  Thanks for the recipe!

This doesn't need another great review but here is one anyways.  I am new to making bread with a bread machine, I either bought bread or handmade.  With a very busy one year old underfoot, I decided on the compromise of a bread machine and this was the second recipe.  This is wonderfull bread, slightly sweet but nutty with the whole wheat.  I would say how long it stayed fresh but it was gone too soon.  2nd batch in the machine as I type.  Great recipe!

Tastes just like Orowheat double fiber bread, except a LOT cheaper to make than buy. I took the suggestion of a few other reviewers and added 3 tbs of wheat gluten and instead of using shortening, I used the same amount of melted salted butter. It has a good texture with a slight sweetness from the honey. It slices great and is good for sandwiches, toast, etc.

I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour.  I used my bread machine on the whole wheat setting and selected the "light" crust option.  I added the honey and the salt with the liquid ingredients first.  The loaf turned out lovely.  I served it warm with soup.  My kids even loved it. It is surprisingly light for a whole wheat bread.

Loved it!  My 19 month daughter can't get enough, neither can my husband.  He even made some in the bread machine, and he doesn't bake!  My daughter helped (she pushed the buttons!).  I didn't change a thing-except I used whole wheat bread flour out of bulk at Winco, and everything was great!

This is by far the best loaf of bread to come out of my bread machine. I used butter instead of shortening and only half the honey. It's so quick and simple to make - it will be my standard week-day recipe from now on. For those of you with variable loaf-size settings, I used the 500g or 1/2-pound setting and it was perfect. Thanks for the super recipe, Melissa!

This bread is delicious. A full day after making it I find that it is still very fresh. I love the sweetness of it. I substitued multigrain flour for the whole wheat. Thank you!

I only eat whole wheat flour, always have. I guess I am kind of picky because I will only eat 2 brands from the health food store, and with everything going up in price I am trying to bake more from scratch. This bread is so simple and perfect the only thing I added is 3 tbs of gluten. You can but gluten in bulk at health food stores or at amazon.com.

THE BEST!  I have tried several variations in my bread machine and finally settled on this one.  I did as others suggested and put my salt in the water, added 3 tbsp of wheat gluten and used the basic, 1.5 lb loaf, light crust setting.  I didn't have any honey so I used 1/2 of 1/3 cup of mollases and 1/2 of 1/3 cup of sugar and it still worked out great!  Definitely will be my staple wheat bread in my home.

The revised recipe provided by other reviewers are really useful.  

One more tip to add.  

My bread machine always made bread tough and dark crust with light setting.  Now I figured that keep warm cycle after baking was a culprit.  After bake, I took off loaf out of machine.  Finally bread is fluffy.  Also, used warm water to help rise.

Believe it when you read all of these rave reviews!  I couldn't imagine how so few simple ingredients could make such a teriffic loaf, but believe me it's the best bread I've ever eaten!  My husband just finished making a loaf in the oven and it was awesome!  I'd be fine never having any other bread but this one!  You HAVE to try this!

I thought this was absolutely fantastic!!  I went pretty much by the recipe.  I did use the Basic/Light setting on my breadmaker, versus the Wheat setting.  But I realized later that this same exact recipe came with my breadmaker for the Wheat/Rapid setting.  I'll try that next time.  I am anxious to get some vital wheat gluten and try it with that next time to see if I could get it a little lighter, but I will make it again either way.  I plan to start making this for daily-use.  Forget paying $3 for basic store-bought loaves!

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  I can't tell you how long I've been looking for a good whole wheat recipe that tasted and looked good!  I did substitute butter for shortening (i didn't have any) and made the basic high altitude adjustments (3TB Gluten, extra 3 TB water, extra tsp of salt and only just shy of 1 1/4 tsp of yeast). Next time I probably will decrease the honey.

The best bread I've ever made! I doubled the recipe, used the "dough" cycle on my bread machine, and baked it in the oven.I used flaxseed oil instead of shortening. It turned out wonderful, even my super-picky husband loved it! I'm glad I made two loafs!

This was excellent.  Hint of sweetness and hearty.  The only substition I made was margarine instead of butter.  I also used the DOUGH option on my bread machine (Zojirushi).  Once the dough cycle was complete, I punched down the dough, placed on a floured board to shape it into a loaf and place in lightly greased loaf pan.  Baked for 35 minutes at 350.  Crust was a little chewy but that's how we like it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have any good flour for bread, so I substituted with 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour (too light for bread) 1 cup stoneground wheat flour (too heavy for bread) and 1 cup all purpose flour.  The combination worked perfectly.  I also didn't use the dry milk powder but instead did 1 cup water and 1/8 cup milk.  And I used butter rathr than shortening.  This bread is truely delicious!  It is very imporatant since there is so much whole wheat in it that you ensure that all of your ingredients are warm first so the yeast has time to activate.  Also salt touching yeast will deactivate the yeast so I always pour in half of my flour then the salt and then the other half of the flour to ensure no touching.  I keep my flours in the freezer so they don't go bad, so I microwave the flour for 1 minute before putting it in the pan.  Also my bread machine seems to overbake this loaf, so I have learned that it's light setting at 4hours 19min is still too long and I take it out of the pan when there is about 5-6 minutes left in baking.  I still give the recipe 5 stars because with any bread recipe you have to adjust it to work for you.

just finished a piece.  yum!  have been making bread for years, in our move lost my favorite recipe, looked up this one and is great!  it is amazing of the factors that affect your bead making, the machine, the temp in your house, how old /fresh your ingredients are.. especially your  yeast and whole wheat flour, which by the time you've bought it at the store, already has lost many reasons why we all try whole wheat to begin with!  Try fresh ground flour!  perfect!

I love this bread because it has whole wheat flour and honey instead of all-purpose flour and sugar.  It is healthy AND it tastes great!  Make sure you use the 1 1/2 lb. setting on your bread machine if it makes different sizes.

I made this with my kitchenaid dough hook and cooked it in the oven.  The dough did not rise very much so next time I will try increasing the yeast.  The flavor of the bread is very good.

This is a great recipe!! I do have a question: the bread was very crumbly and need to have some suggestions on what I did wrong or what needs to be added to make the texture more firm.

I had to double the recipe for my bread machine but turned out great. I baked it on the wheat setting and made sure everyting was measured correctly.

If your bread didn't come out right you have to learn to experiment! Bread machines can be very different! I have a Breadman Ultimate. I followed the recipe (whole wheat flour only) using margarine instead of shortening and added 3T gluten, used the light crust white cycle on my machine; it came out very undercooked but tasty, worth another try. I set the machine on light crust wheat the second time and it did better, still a bit underbaked. Finally I found my machine's perfect setting for this bread - wheat, medium crust. The bread is excellent, healthy, and will be the only bread we eat from now on.

Fantastic!  My first bread machine recipe, and it's a winner!  I used Olive Oil, and sub'd 1/8c. soy milk for water.  I'll be making this for friends & family.  Easy, nutritious & delicious. Thank you!

My husband keeps asking me when I will be making this again. It really is a moist, amazingly super Bread. I used 1/4 cup buttermilk in substitute for some of the water. Just wanted to playaround with the recipe. This one is a keeper Thanks a ton for sharing!

Great recipe - light, moist, and most of all flavorful. This was my first time with this recipe and I let it raise a little too long making it too airy.  My family didn't care as they devoured it right out of the oven.

I make this in my bread maker (1 1/2lb loaf). 1/8c=2T.  The bread is very good; it has a sweet flavor, and the bread is dense, which I enjoy.

Wonderful!  I just ate a turkey sandwich on this bread today - and it tasted like a deli sandwich - it was heavenly.  It is kind of dense, but I think it tastes like sourdough bread, and I love sourdough bread.  I mixed the dough in the bread machine, then I spread it out, rolled it into a loaf, and let it raise another two hours in a regular loaf pan before baking it for 25 minutes at 350.  I also used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour - but I will definitely try using 3 cups ww flour next time.

Can someone explain to me why my wheat bread doesn't rise? I just can't seem to get it right. I followed the recipe, but it came out about the size of 2 slices of bread and was extremely dense. What did I do wrong? I would greatly appreciate any comments or tips!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!  No need for butter or anything, took it out of the oven and it was half gone before it cooled!  Did substitute 2 Tbsp canola oil for the shortening and baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 min.... WONDERFUL and oh so easy!

Of all the whole wheat bread recipes on this site, this one was my least favorite. For some reason, it didn't rise very high and because of that, it didn't have the best appearance. It wasn't terrible - just not as good as others and I wouldn't make it again.

When we tried out this bread we were at first enhanced by the lovely smell! As our very first time using the bread machine, we burnt it, but even then it tasted fine and you couldn't have just one slice. We didn't do anything to the ingredients, but the facts are: no matter how burnt or underbaked you get it, it'll still taste great.

This was great bread. I did as the other reviewers suggested and baked in the oven and used 2 tablespoons canola oil instead of the shortening. The results were fantastic! If you do bake your bread in the oven be sure to grease the pan first.  This bread is a keeper!

YUM!  This is the best whole wheat honey bread!  I didn't have dry milk powder, so I used 1 cup water and 1/8 cut skim milk.  Very light and airy for 100% whole wheat.  This is defintely more of a 'sandwich bread' than a bread I would just rip apart and eat.  I will definitely make this again!

Suggestion for those at high altitude: use half the yeast in the recipe. Took me a while to get this right, as I tried using 3/4 or 2/3 at first, but those loaves fell.  I'm in Denver (5300 ft), and this time it came out just right! I also made the substitutions others suggested: half the flour was bread flour, butter instead of shortening, and reduce the salt (only 1/4 tsp). The bread machine was set for basic bread with a light crust. Plus I added 2 tbsp more water (standard high altitude adjustment). yum!

Great recipe.... I just add a bit more honey, and added 4 tablespoon of Organic wheat germ for added fiber. I am thinking walnuts or some sort of nut. Might add a wonderful texture to this bread. And also used King Arthur Whole wheat flour....

I have made this bread 3 times in the past two weeks and it turned out great every time! I used soy milk powder, butter in place of shortening, and 3T of gluten. Placed all liquid ingredients first along with salt (1t) than all the dry ingredients with the yeast on top.

This did not turn out as well as I was hoping.  My bread was rather dry and did not have too much of a honey flavor.  I did not have any shortening so I used butter instead.  Was that a mistake???  This is only the 2nd recipe I've made in my bread machine, so I'm still trying to familiarize myself with the procedure.  It's possible that I made a mistake somewhere...I'm still trying to figure that out.  I sure wish this would have turned out better, but I'm definitely not discouraged from trying out other bread recipes.

This one surely is a good bread. It's got a great texture and a light honey taste. Next time I bake it, I'm gonna try a stronger flavoured honey, just to taste it more when biting in my sandwich.

Really good. I made the recipe as-is (with the exception of not adding the dry milk powder, simply because I didn't have any, so I left it out, not adding anything else in its place) and it came out moist and slightly sweet from the honey. Will definitely make this again.

King of the breads indeed!
Just bought my Zojirushi bread machine and wow, what a wonderful yummy 1st loaf I made!
I honestly was going to skip this recipe all together because of the shortening listed as an ingredient but I'm glad I didn't and sub with unsalted butter, also didn't have powder milk so I just I sub a 1/8milk instead of water. Here are some pointers for Zo machine owners:
If you have a Zo machine you are better off adjusting this recipe to 16 servings because the 3 cups of flour are not enough for the machine. Zojirushi told me to use breadmachinedigest.com to convert the recipe and so I did.
I made the recipe as a12 servings and it wasn't bad but you don't get the full slice size for a sandwich but still delicious!
I made the recipe as a 18servings and it was amazing! What a loaf. As delish as it is, for me is too sweet as an everyday bread so I cut down on the honey a bit but first try with the full amount of honey and the decide for your own! 
Like I said: King of the Breads!

This was my maiden attempt at baking bread and it came out wonderful! I am not very good with measured cooking preferring to go more by instincts but this recipe is so forgiving !!! Loved the bread and am gonna make more!

Excellent! The best whole wheat loaf I've made in my Zo. I did make changes as suggested by others: I used 33% bread flour and 67% whole wheat, added vital wheat gluten, used butter for shortening and milk for half the water instead of powdered milk. I resized this to 18 servings for my 2 lb machine and used the basic white setting and medium crust on my Zo. It's supposed to be for sandwiches this week, but it might not make it that long, it's soooo good! I'll try higher % of whole wheat next time. Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe turned out so moist considering it used only whole wheat flour! I was also surprised that with a whole 1/3 cup of honey, it didn't turn out too sweet. The only thing I changed was using some whey or milk in place of water instead of water and milk powder.

I'm a novice bread baker, this was my second loaf ever to bake and it came out great. I used my bread machine on a basic loaf setting, not the wheat and followed a couple other suggestions in other reviews, put the salt and honey with the water and I used Canola oil. The bread came out nice and crusty, inside soft but not too soft which is the way we like it.This loaf came out much better then the recipe I got with my new bread machine.

I don't have a bread machine, but I really wanted to make 100% whole wheat flour bread. So I did it old fashion way.  I used 4 cups of whole wheat four because it was too wet.  It didn't rise very much, so I ended up with pretty dense bread but tastes great!! I set my oven 375, and the crust turned out a little hard so next time I would try 360. Because it didn't rise a lot, and texture turned out dense (but still soft and yummy!), it was very easy to slice the bread, however, if anyone knows something I should know when I want to make a bread machine recipe by hand, please tell me!

Great recipe.  Just starting out with bread making and so far have not had great luck, but I really liked this one.

I used butter instead of shortening.  Also threw in some raisins, but next time I do that I will add some cinnamon as well for flavour.

Next time I might also try substituting 1 Cup white flour (as others have suggested) just to make it slightly more appealing to my picky kids.

Great recipe!  I added the gluten to it, and used butter instead of shortening.  I also warmed the liquid before adding it.  I set my bread maker to "wheat".  It turned out perfect -- not a flaw.  Everybody ate it up and loved it --- without even putting butter or anything on it.

This is my go to recipe for bread. I replace 1 cup of flour with 1 cup wheat germ and add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. My 5 year old nephew will only eat white bread but thinks this is a special treat and asks for it when he comes over.

I made this recipe and followed the advice of other reviewers.  I substituted 1/8 cup of milk for the dry milk powder and used 1 cup of white bread flour.  I used stone ground hard whole wheat flour.  The bread rose beautifully and had a very nice texture. My family found the bread to be a bit too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the honey by half.

I love this bread!  It's worth a second try if the first run fails.  I'm not sure if it's my conditions or my fresh milled flour (hard white wheat this time), but most recipes fail as written for me.  In this case I added 2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten and used only a cup of water.  Also I used the basic/light crust setting.  The taste was spot on.  I need to tweak the water a little more as the sweet spot is somewhere between 1 c and 1 and 1/8th c for me, but I will be making again.

Mmmm, tasty! And so easy! I think this will become a weekly staple at our house. I did not substitute any ingredients, but did add in a small handful of cracked wheat to the mix. I added the salt into the warm water - not sure that made a difference or not for rising, but my loaf rose perfectly and had a perfect crust. I set my machine on the standard white loaf 2 lb cycle. The only trouble I ran across was trying to get the loaf out after it had cooked. The bottom was a little stuck, but it eventually released.

Best bread recipe ever. Perfect density for thin or thick slicing. Nice and moist. Great flavor. I will never buy store bread again when this is so easy to make, tastes amazing, and is perfect for anything such as grilled cheese sandwiches to toast. Yum!

I found this bread to be almost sickeningly sweet. I did make it again, however, but I only used about 1 tbsp of honey. It turned out much better. I also added 1/4 cup of wheat gluten to make it lighter.

mine did not rise the way it was supposed to I am guessing it was a yeast problem... the flavor was very very good even though it was very dense.... a good tasting whole wheat bread....

This really IS as good as everyone has said!  I didn't have the powdered milk so I did one cup water and 1/4 cup buttermilk.  As it was mixing it the dough looked really wet, so I added a palmful more of flour; it still looked wet, but I left it alone.  So glad I did!  Crust is...crusty, and inside is nice and moist.  My bread knife slices right through this bread as though it were store-bought.  Will make regularly!  I have an old, second-hand bread machine, and I used the "White Medium, 2 lb." setting, as previous reviewers had mentioned the crust being too dark - worked perfectly!

The bread turned out to be very good, but like all other wheat breads I have tried, it was more risen towards to top and more heavy on the bottom.

I found my/THE bread recipe-this is going to sit at the top of my breadmaker recipe box as a go-to everyday all purpose "healthy" bread.  Love the fact that it uses all whole wheat flour and basic simple ingredients to yield the perfect bread for sandwiches, toast and even grilled cheese.  I've tried other wheat breads which have come out with a dry texture-this one is perfect.  It's hearty and sturdy (won't fall apart like some egg bread recipes), cuts clean and is as smooth as the honey that goes in it!  Like others I used vegetable oil instead of shortening....something about the combination of the milk powder and honey does this thing fine.  This might not produce a loaf of bread with the rise of a bread flour recipe but it does indeed rise given time and patience and produces an OUTSTANDING whole wheat honey of a bread!  Like I said, a KEEPER for me.....just bought a jar of honey for future use.

This bread was delicious the second try.  The first try it did not rise and did not cook in the center.  I had followed the recipe but replaced the shortening with oil.  However, the first time I followed my machine's directions on laying and the second time I followed CareyG's laying instructions on one of these reviews and it turned out perfectly and delicious the second time.  I will definitely make this again.

This is delicious bread!  I used light whole wheat flour and no dry milk powder (because I'm allergic to dairy and forgot to sub in some of my almond milk for the water) but everything else as directed.  I used the light crust and basic whole wheat settings and it rose super high and was delicious.  This is the first time I've used light crust and actually had it turn out lighter and thinner, especially on the sides.  I really love this bread and know I'll be making this often!

Not certain if I did something wrong or if it is our breadmachine (Welbilt) but, this didn't rise above the .5 the container. Very disappointed will try a variation below.

It did not turn out perfect for me, only made it once so far. The taste is very good, but the sides burnt and the crust is a bit harder than id like especially on the bottom, also it formed very strangely. Perhaps ill try a lighter setting and substitute some bread flour in next time i try it. Still one of the best recipes i have tried thus far.

Best wheat bread Iv made so far! the only thing I did different was I used butter not shortening, and I followed Flannery suggestion and added the vital wheat gluten   wonderful texture and taste... sweet and light.  Next time I will make it on the white setting, on my machine it came out a little to brown.

Pretty good recipe. Very tasty but would not rise properly as stated. Followed another reviewer's advice and added 3 tbsp wheat gluten and subbed the shortening for canola oil (2 tbsp). Wow! Made an amazing loaf of bread!!

Perfect tecture, perfect flavor. We also use this recipe for rolls. There are a few things I change that make it perfect. Instead of shortening, I use 4 T butter, I use 1/2 C honey and 2 teaspoons yeast.  I was having a problem with it not rising so I proof the yeast with the hot water and honey.

Pretty bad as the wheat bread didn't rise and was not quite done in the center.  I don't know what the problem was as I followed the recipe as and I use my bread maker frequently.  Won't be making this again and I'll just stick to the recipes I have.

This is the first time I have gotten my bread machine to work properly.  Thank you!  I made some minor changes - I microwaved 1 cup of milk (becuase I didn't have milk powder), 1/8c water and the honey (because I keep it in the fridge) for 45 seconds.  I used canola oil instead of shortening because I was out and added  salt, 2c of whole wheat flour with 1 c of bread flour.  I topped it with one package of active dry yeast on the BASIC setting with a the light crust option (though I will try the medium next time, beause of personal preference).   I was so happy it rose properly!  This was my 3rd attempt at making bread.  Next time I will try adding Vital Wheat Gluten.

This bread was SO yummy! I don't keep shortening or milk powder in the house so I used butter and milk. I also added 4 tsp vital wheat gluten to help with the rise. Followed advice of a couple reviewers to cook on white/basic. It still didn't rise well and was a little dense. We didn't mind b/c it was SO tasty. Next time I think I'll try the wheat setting b/c it was a tiny bit doughy in the middle. Will also try 4 Tblsp gluten and add salt to liquids instead of dry. Either way, it's great!

Excellent recipe for bread machines. We bake this one a regular basis and never have any problems with it. Remember to keep leftover bread in the refrigerator... there are no preservatives in this so it will go bad quickly on the counter!

WOW! This is great bread. I used butter instead of shortening and mixed the salt with the liquids; both suggested by other reviewers. I am so happy with it! It's got the right amount of balance to it, not dense and not too sweet. Also, I used the white bread setting and put it to light - I have an Oster machine.

My whole family loves this bread. I, like others who have commented, don't use a bread machine. I also am not blessed with a kitchen aid, So I make this the old fashioned way at least twice a week. Easy and tastes great.

We love this bread!  I have a Panasonic SD-YD250 bread machine.  I use the recipe as is; the only substitution is to use 1 cup of bread flour and 2 cups of freshly ground whole wheat flour instead of 3 cups of wheat flour.    I use the "sandwich" setting on the machine and I usually throw everything in the night before and set the timer to have the loaf complete in the morning.  Nothing like waking up to the smell of freshly baked bread!

Usin this recipe and after making the modifications suggested by Flannery, I have finally been able to make a soft fluffy loaf of whole wheat bread from my breadmachine. I was just about ready to send my bread machine back. I have made over 10 loaves of bread and none of them have turned out as wonderful as this loaf! I am thrilled that I was finally able to produce a loaf of whole wheat bread that is just stunning! Thank you for the original recipe and thank you to Flannery for the modifications! My breadmachine will be able to stay in our home.

I've tried several whole wheat bread recipes, including some that took a lot more time and effort, but this one turned out the best one. It rises well, not heavy, good flavour. Will keep making this. Changes I made: veg oil instead of shortening, added one egg, replaced 1/4 wheat flour with white flour (will not need do that next time), added 1/4 cup of uncooked oats. Plan to add raisins to some batches.

This is sooo good! I use a machine on the dough setting then knead it one more time, shape it, let it rise then bake in the oven. Love that it is only whole wheat flour and NOT heavy! Thanks!!!

This bread is excellent!  It came out soft and rose very well.  The only thing I added was vital wheat gluten.  This will become a staple in my house.  Thanks!

Made this to use with the Original Recipe French Toast from this site. Excellent! Had it the next day with a roast beef sandwich and that was great too. Thank you!

This bread is absolutely delicious! I love the honey flavour.  The only change I made was to use canola oil instead of shortening. I will be making this often.

just made this, turned out fabulous!  I added 3 TBS dough enhancer (vital wheat gluten) as recommended by others.  Also didn't have dry powdered milk, so put in 1/8 cup milk and only 1 cup water.  Will definitely be making this frequently.

I've been making this loaf for the past week-and-a-half -- it sure doesn't last very long around here.  I pretty much follow the recipe and it comes out perfect, every time.  I do tweak the recipe slightly.  I have no shortening so I substitute that with butter.  Also, I add 1.5 tsp of vital wheat gluten per cup of whole wheat flour.  Sometimes I will use molasses in place of the honey if we are looking for a sandwich loaf.  My wife finds the honey too sweet for that purpose.  I will be looking no further for a regular wheat recipe.  Thanks for posting!

Excellent whole wheat bread!  Even better than store bought bread.  I made a couple of changes to the recipe that made it even better.  Used 1 1/4 cups of water, added 4 Tablespoons Wheat Gluten (essential when using all whole wheat flour), and added 2 Tablespoons brown sugar.  I also mixed all the dry ingredients, except salt and sugar, together before adding to the bread machine.  Dissolved the salt and sugar into the water and added it first along with the honey.  I actually forgot to add the shortening and it still turned out excellent.

So far, this is my favourite whole wheat recipe for my new breadmaker, and my husband loved this one because of the honey, but I'm still looking for a lighter bread recipe. Perhaps you can't do it with 100% whole wheat? I don't know, but I'll keep searching.

I love this recipe. The bread turned out perfect and my family ate the whole loaf in five mins. I like to use my bread maker to make the dough and then I cook it in the oven. I do not like how the bread turns out in the maker and the oven it turns out perfect. I cooked it at 350 for 30 mins. Great bread, we will make this one again and again!

I used the whole wheat setting on my bread machine and the bread turned out great. The only thing I changed was using 2.5 cups whole wheat flour and 0.5 cup bread flour instead of 3 cups of whole wheat flour. Next time I will probably use 1/4 cup honey instead of 1/3 cup honey, but still a very good recipe.

For whole wheat bread, ths was great!  I used regular milk instead of milk powder, since I didn't have any, but the milk powder may have made it even better!

I make this once a week for sandwiches. It is soft, tasty and has no high fructose corn syrup like most store bought brands.  I use the dough cycle on my bread maker and then bake it in the oven.  It comes out perfect every time.

I use this as our everyday sandwich bread.  After cooling completely, it holds up very nice.  I use 1.5 cups white, and 1.5 cups wheat.  What is especially nice is that it does not stale fast.  I live in a very humid climate and we can eat the same loaf for days without it getting too stale.  Very good, simple recipe.

This bread turned out great !! The crust was so tender and it was simple to put together. I have made it 5 or 6 times. I too put butter instead of shortening and use the wheat gluten. I have been putting wheat berries in also. I haven't used any other recipe since I ran across this one. Delicious !!

I was very pleased with this recipe. It is very moist and has good flavor. It stayed moist up until it was gone almost 3 days later. So far it hasn't lasted longer than that. I did use butter instead of shortening and used 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup white flour. I also used the whole wheat setting on my Breadman. I have used the regular cycle and the rapid cycle and both turned out wonderful. Now that I have a good wheat recipe I am going to try a little ground flax and oats in it as well.

This made a really delicious loaf of whole wheat bread.  The only changes I made were to add 1 tablespoon of yeast (all my bread machine recipes call for 1 Tbls with 3 cups of flour) and to use butter in place of shortening.  I used my Whole Wheat setting for the extra kneading and rise time.  I got a beautiful high loaf.  Texture is very good and soft.  This is a keeper!

This bread was very dense and reminded me of bread I've eaten in Germany.  Not light and fluffy, but a meal in itself.  Maybe not for everyone...  Not really a sandwich bread, but would probably make great rolls.  I think I will try 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour next time to lighten the texture a bit.

One of the best 100% whole wheat bread recipes I have ever made in a bread maker. I add about 1-2 tablespoons of Vital Gluten and it helps the bread rise a bit more. The texture is perfect. I have also added dried cranberries on a few batches for a wonderful twist.

This is a very good bread recipe.  I made a few changes by adding wheat gluten and baking it in the oven.  It rose really well and the flavor is good.  Not a big fan of using the shortening but I will more than likely make again.

Didn't rise well. I'm going to use some gluten and 2.5 cups Wheat flour and .5 cups bread flour and try again. I will update my review if it works this time.

Good tasting, but very small and dense.  I even added gluten for a better rise.  I doubt I will make this again.  Use the "light" crust setting if you try it.

I have just started making my own bread.  This was the second recipe I tried...and it's a keeper!  Although I have no problem using just whole wheat flour; as I do not mind the taste, my husband didn't like it so much.  So I used 1 c. white flour & 2 c. whole wheat and he and the kids love it!  I don't use as much honey, and I am tinkering with increasing the wheat...but overall this makes a great all-purpose bread.  Wonderful for sandwiches & toast!  I too use my Kitchen-Aide mixer...and it's so easy!!  I can now eat a sandwich and not feel guilty about eating bread, because I know this is a fairly healthy recipe...with no added preservatives!  I double the recipe and put one in the freezer so I'm not having to make bread every other day!

This was the very first bread I made in my new Bread Machine.  I screwed up at least 3 things while making this.  (Didn't have any powdered milk so I added another 1/2 Tbsp. butter, forgot to make sure liquid was at correct temperature, and baked it on speed cycle which isn't recommended for 100% whole wheat bread, oh yeah and I also added additional yeast during the first kneading cycle since I changed to the speed cycle after it had already begun)  All that said and it still turned out delicious, my 2 year old daughter who doesn't eat bread literally asked for several pieces.  Really delicious!

Super 100% wheat recipe.  The only change I made was to use butter for the shortening.

The "wheat" setting worked fine with my machine.

Thanks!

What a fantastic recipe!  I make this at least a few times a week.  In fact, I don't remember the last time I bought a loaf of bread.

I found this recipe on Monday and have made 5 loaves since. My picky eater son even came home and asked if there was any left.
The only change I made is substituting 1 cup of bread flour and I cheat and mix it in the bread machine then remove it to rise and bake it in the oven.
Thank you, we love it.

EXCELLENT!  I don't have a bread machine so I mixed it in my kitchenaid, I stirred the honey into the warm water until dissolved then added milk powder and yeast and let sit for about 5 min then added butter instead of shortening and salt and then gradually added the flour with dough hook on stir or low and let the kitchenaid mix for about 5 or 10 min  and then let it rise  then punched it down and made into a loaf and let it rise again.  It was delicious!!

Good chewy bread!  Great toasted and topped with with honey or peanut butter.  I substitue canola oil for the butter to reduce saturated fat.  My toddlers love it plain even!

My bread machine always burns it so I set in on the dough cycle, then put shaped dough in a greased loaf pan let rise an hour (I heat my oven to 200F, turn it off let it sit 10 min then put the bread in.  Works great for rising in a cold house).  Then I cooked it at 350F for 30 min.  I think our oven cooks hot so I will reduce the temperature next time.  It's really good bread.  Sweet and nutty, not too heavy which is a wonder since it's homemade whole wheat.   SO MUCH BETTER THAN STORE BOUGHT!!  And SO easy!

This was pretty good, but mine came out of the bread machine tasting bitter. I couldn't figure it out. I used the exact ingredients it called for. After it sat a bit, it started tasting a little more sweet and lost some of the bitter flavor. But then it sank in the middle and was lopsided. I may try it again but bake it in the oven this time.

Very soft, tasty bread. I can't stop eating it!
I followed the recipe exactly and everything turned out great!
I love how simple this recipe is, and how there are very few ingredients needed. 
I'll be making this one again... no more store bought bread for me!

This turned out fantastic!  It was soft and  delicious.  It did come out lopsided.  I wonder if the dough is too thick and doesn't spread out in the pan in the machine after the kneading.  I'll mess around with the liquids a bit and see if that helps.  This one is a keeper!  I'll be making it weekly.

I just got a bread machine and decided to try out this whole wheat recipe for my first loaf. It was my first time ever making whole wheat anything and it turned out great. The flavor was awesome! It turned out a little funny shaped but I think that's because I let it bake in the machine, next time I might try the oven. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Good recipe. Only gave it 4 1/2 stars because it overflowed in my machine (and my machine makes 2 1/2 pound loaves); I followed the recipe to a T.  All in all, it was very tasty bread and very moist, even after a few days.  will make again.

I didn't change anything about this recipe. The setting on my bread machine wouldn't allow me to change the crust setting from medium. The bread turned out a bit dark, I was expecting a lighter color. However, the flavor was gret. I'll be making this bread again!

This is very good.  I think the amount is a bit small for my bread machine, because it came out lopsided (a little shorter on one end).  But I'm not complaining because it came out very nice.  I did add 3 tbs vital wheat gluten to help it be fluffy, and it worked well.  Bf wasn't impressed, but he doesn't like wheat bread much.  It wasn't enough to convert him, but I liked it!

It tastes great, but I can't get it to fluff up right. I'm going to try the Vital Wheat Gluten as recommended in the recipes.

Love this recipe! So easy, and tastes great. I use half wheat flour and half all-purpose. We like to use it for sandwich bread so I use the dough setting on my bread machine then bake in a bread pan to get that nice sandwich shape.

I have had such bad luck finding a recipie I could alter by using Kamut or Spelt flour for my little boy who is allergic to wheat. This recipie worked PERFECTLY. My child is super picky, and he sat on the countertop eating chunks off the loaf before I could even slice it!

Thank you!

We loved it - the loaf was gone in a flash.  I didn't have dry milk powder, but it turned out fantastic anyway - just following some of the other suggestions to add salt to the water, and changing to white bread, light crust setting.  Thanks for such a simple, delicious recipe!

This is by far the best bread recipe I have ever tried, in fact, we live on it.  I was able to convert this recipe to a 2lb loaf by changing the number of servings to 18.  I also add 1tsp of Vital Wheat Gluten per cup of whole wheat flour to the dry ingredients.  Perfect bread every time!!!  My three year old grandson walks in the door begging for a slice of this stuff!

Very good.  I tried the recommendation of adding 1/2 cup of breadflour and it really does make it rise better.  When I just use all wholewheat flour, the taste is good but it does not rise as much.  I also add ground flax seed and sunflower seeds to the dough and it makes it really good.

This bread recipe is amazing!  I will certainly be making this again.  It is so good with a little peanut butter on it...mmmmm!  As suggested by others, I did substitute a 1/2 C. of AP flour for whole wheat and added 1 TBS. of vital wheat gluten.

My husband loves this bread to use for his lunch box.  I did as many others and subed 1/2 of a cup of the wheat flour for 1/2 cup of bread flour it seems to make it just a little more fluffy and ready for the turckey and swiss.  YUMMY!!

I have made SEVERAL different recipes in both my bread maker and in the over. This recipe is rather delicious.  My first time making it--it didn't raise very high, it was much wetter than most doughs, and it kind of sank in the middle while cooking...but it tastes fantastic.  I don't know yet how easily it will slice for sandwich purpsoes, but the flavor wont dissapoint.  I think I may try some of the tricks other reviewers have suggested.  I made it exactly (but for shortening I used butter). Great Recipe Altogether.

I would give this bread NO stars if I could. It did not rise well at all and came out as a hard lump. I followed my machine's instructions as well as the recipe. Horrible bread will never make again!

This is the tenderest, most flavorful loaf of whole-wheat bread I've ever made.  I used K.A. "White Whole Wheat" flour and added 3 tablespoons of gluten.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I tried so many recipes from the manual on my bread machine and they all came out horrible. Thanks so much for a perfect wheat bread recipe! Taste just like the expensive loafs we use to buy.

This is fantastic!  I use butter instead of shortening, and substitute 1 Tbsp of wheat gluten for flour, and use the basic setting on the bread machine.

i made modifications like others had suggested after the first loaf didnt turn out so well...
the second time,
-used butter instead of shortening
-used 1/8c milk and decreased water to 1c
-used molasses instead of honey (thats what i had on hand)
-proofed yeast first and kept it away from the salt

very good, simple healthy bread!

Not a fan of this bread, its too dense for us.  Nice for toast, but way to dry for sandwiches, which is what I was looking for.  I didnt care for the honey taste either, but thats just me.  I'll feed the last of the loaf to the birds.

This was the first time I made a bread using my KitchenAid's hook (I don't own a bread machine), rather than by hand, and it turned out wonderfully.  My family loved the flavor, the texture was very even and fine, though the rising took longer than normal (2hrs for first rising, and about an hour for the second, which I would let go longer next time).  I used the butter instead of shortening, and I would probably add more gluten next time, but this was a spectacular bread with good flavor and a beautiful finish.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe. I used the recipe just as it directed and my bread turned out fabulous. It was great toasted with butter and jam ontop. And it was still the perfect texture two days later for sandwiches.

This is a great 100% whole wheat loaf. It's very dense and delicious. The only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening. Other than that, it's perfect.

I make this every week for my family.  It is delicious as is, but to change things up I will add 1/4 cup each: sunflower seeds, sesame seeds and flax seeds. Also, I never have on hand milk powder, so I always leave that out.

I really like this recipe! I've been looking for a good wheat bread for my machine that could be good for sandwiches, and I believe this one's the best. Light but still hearty. Flavor is mild and very good. A+!

I am making this recipe again today. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe. This time I am adding sunflower seeds. I really liked the first loaf but just wanted to add a little crunch. I thought it came out perfect the first time. I have a Nutritionist breadmachine and I selected whole wheat setting. This machine also has a rapid whole wheat setting but I was afraid to try that one. I liked the idea of using all wholewheat flour. I have been looking for a bread with more fiber than you can find at the grocery store.

i've never had any luck with 100% whole wheat recipes before, but this one turned out beautiful, rounded on top, fairly fluffy (not too dense) and very good tasting. i did have to add quite a bit of flour, tablespoon at a time during the first 30-40 minutes. i think i ended up adding at least an extra 1/2 cup of flour by the end.... not sure how it will do without me babysitting it overnight. overall a great recipe though! i will continue to use it. thanks

Mine came out very overcooked. Because of the particular bread machine I have, it only cooks whole wheat on one program. I am going to try scaling it to 18 servings instead - But I could tell the taste will be GREAT!

Outstanding. I was a little shy of having the 1/3 C of honey, so I subbed with about 3 tablespoons of molasses. Added a really nice dimension to the flavor of this bread. DEELISH!

I hate to write negative reviews but I followed this recipe exactly and my dough was so mushy as it was mixing I ended up adding about ¼ cup more whole-wheat flour and then about 2 Tblsp. more bread flour. Then my loaf still didn’t rise at all. I even used real shortening as called for, except mine was butter flavored. Yes, my yeast was fresh. I was going to throw the little pathetic 5 inch loaf out but it wasn’t really hard as a rock like some flops I’ve had before. So I decided I should, at least, taste it. Without rising it was very dense but that wasn’t too bad. 3 stars for this one, it was moist and the honey wheat flavor was really good.  Needs more flour (or less water) than called for and also a good bit more yeast and/or gluten. I hate to waste ingredients experimenting but I might try this recipe, tweaked up, again. I don't know how all those other reviewers got all those 5 star results!

Great recipe!  I've made this three times already.  Once I accidentally added 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1/3 cup.  Once I didn't quite have a third cup of honey so I added a little less and all three times I incorrectly added 3 instead of 1 TBS of dry milk powder.  On purpose I used butter instead of shortening.  This bread turned out great every time.  My kids love it and so does my hubby who doesn't usually eat bread.

This is a great recipe!  I changed to 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour and it came out to be really soft.  This is great for sandwiches.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  I used the suggested changes of adding gluten and half molasses for the sweetener and tweaked it a little of my own -substituted white whole wheat flour from King Arthur and used two tablespoons of vegetable oil for the shortening.  Baked in a 9x5" pan at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.  This is the best 100% whole wheat bread I've ever tasted!!  Light and has great texture.  Next time (and there will be many more next times) I may add oatmeal and make rolls.  This is yummy stuff.

I have made this 3 times and my family loves it. Best bread machine recipe ever! I added the 4.5 tsp of gluten recommended by someone else. I used stone ground wheat from a local mill the first 2 times and the last time I used Pillsbury whole wheat. I must say, there is a difference in flours, the stone ground fresh wheat made a nice grainer bread. I will definately  get some more just to make this bread. Its going to be a staple in our house from now on. Excellent for sandwiches too, slices perfectly. I use the dough cycle and bake in my oven.

I followed the advice of some of the others and added 4 1/2 tsp. wheat gluten, 1 Tbsp. each of sunflower seeds, flax seeds, and soynuts, and substituted molasses for the honey. I used the dough cycle of my bread machine to prepare the dough, and then I baked it in the oven. The result was an absolutely perfect loaf of delicious and wholesome whole wheat bread. I will surely make it again. Many thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This bread is very good, but if you don't like your wheat bread sweet, I'd suggest lowering the amount of honey. You can definitely taste it in the bread. I liked it though, made a great turkey and swiss sandwich. I will be using this again. Thank you!

This is the BEST bread recipe I have ever used in my bread machine. It is sooooo good. Although, I didn't have any honey or wheat flour. So I used brown sugar, 1/4c, and 1c old fashioned oats and 2c bread flour. It is just superb! Thanks for sharing. I already have the recipe memorized, I have made it so much.

Perfect!
Great texture, right amount of sweetness. I used the whole wheat setting on the bread machine, let it rise and threw it in the oven. It turned out wonderfully, and got lots of compliments. Full of goodness...you feel healthy eating it.

Excellent flavor, turned out fairly well.  I think I have an older bread machine that may have a smaller capacity than the recipe called for.  This is wonderful warm with melted butter and room temperature honey drizzled on top.

This bread is just fabulous - and I say this as a person who, (until today) did not like whole wheat bread.  Past reviews have suggested adding more honey, I disagree, otherwise the bread would be VERY sweet.  It is absolutely perfect just as it is!

I started making this delicious bread a year ago when I received a breadmaker for my birthday.  This was the first recipe I tried and it was slightly sweet, moist, and satisfying.  This bread is great for sandwiches, breakfast (with a little butter, cream cheese, or jam spread on top), or to have with a bowl of hot stew.  5 stars!!!

This was great! So far, its the only recipe that has cooked perfectly in my bread machine everytime! No more trips to the bread store for me! I did follow the advice and used 2 cups of wheat and 1 cup of all purpose flour.

I made this recipe as my first attempt to use my new bread machine.  It turned out fantastic!  My husband and two year old gobbled it up.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour and set my machine on the light crust setting as other reviewers suggested.  Also, I was half way through putting the recipe together when I realized I didn't have any powdered milk so I just left it out.  Still turned out great!  Thanks for a recipe that even a novice can make successfully on the first try!

This is the best honey whole wheat bread ever!  My whole family loves it, and it has become a staple in our house.  The first time I made it was a disaster - it didn't rise at all, and the inside wasn't cooked.  It tasted so good though, that I tried it again, and it came out perfect.  I've made it many times since then, and it is always wonderful.  I substitute half the whole wheat flour with bread flour and use butter instead of shortening.

Just for personal taste I used 2 C whole wheat and 1 C unbleached white flour.
1/4/C molasses instead of honey, and butter instead of shortning. 
This is the first really good bread I have made with my machine. Even my wife likes it! Toast made with this bread and spread with a good quality margarine and elderberry jelly is out of this world.
A definite keeper!

Good.  I definitely recommend using half white flour, though, or it is way too dense.

This bread tastes good.  My review is a good one - and quite detailed so please excuse the length! The only problems I had are just related to my machine size and user error really, plus I'm sure elevation has something to do with it too - I'm at 4500 ft.  I hadn't used my machine for almost two years (was in storage, and was used then at 4200 ft) and this was one of the first recipes I made.  I love the flavor, but it was too moist and sticky.  I didn't have butter, so I used veg oil (was all I had right then).  I ended up adding more flour, probably an additional 1/2 cup, for it to even rise because of the moisture.  My flour is a little old, so I am wondering if that has anything to do with it.... but the same time, I made an old recipe of a honey whole wheat I had tht did wonderful.  GRR.  I have a 1 lb machine (for now). I'm going to try this recipe again with omitting the dry milk and water, replacing both with 2/3 cup milk - exchanging 1/2 cup of the WW flour with bread flour (my husband doesn't like 100% WW bread, this is both a compromise for him and an attempt to lighten up the bread).  So... wish me luck, here I go!

I used 2/3 whole wheat and 1/3 unbleached white flour and margerine instead of shortening and I love the bread.  The texture is very nice and it was very easy to put together and leave all the rest up to the bread machine.

I substituted about half of the honey with brown sugar (too much honey bothers my stomach) and the bread is very moist and delicious. However, it got too browned on the outside and seems really dense. I used the regular setting on my machine because it doesn't have a whole wheat setting.

Very good. I think maple syrup could be used for a sweetener and add a maple flavour to the bread.

I make bread quite often, whether by hand or using a machine, and with a variety of flours. So I knew this recipe needed  little tweaking to suite my family' s taste. 100% whole bread ls, no doubt, better for you, butt that type of bread when  made at home, is usually too dense and chewy for me. So, I went ahead and used 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup unbleached, all purpose flour. I used olive oil for shortening and just half the honey and the salt. Also, I used my stand mixer to make the dough, let it rise in the bowl for 40 minutes, shaped into a loaf and put in a greased 4x8 loaf pan and let rise again before baking at 350 for about 40 minutes. I let the bread cool down. wrapped in a kitchen towel and left on the kitchen counter for couple of hours before slicing ( that helped again crumbling ). My whole family loved it, toasted with butter and jam..

Finally!!  I have made whole wheat bread over the years but never liked the results.  I like to use the bread maker a lot during the winter but did not want to use regular flour anymore.  For people that had bad results, you probably are not following instructions for using a bread maker.  You put all liquid and the salt in first.  Then add the flour, dry milk.  Finally make a dent in the dry ingredients and add the yeast.  Make sure that your yeast is fresh (it only lasts six months in refrigerator after opening).  Also make sure that your flour is fresh-yes it does expire.  The only change that I made is subbed unsweetened applesauce for the fat.  It has a really good flavor but for sandwiches I will probably cut down a little on the honey next time.  I will be trying to tweak to use as a roll as well.  No more store bread for my house!  Thank you!

The taste and texture was great, I just wish it would have risen a little more.  I did not use this recipe in a bread machine.  Here are the following changes I made:
1.  I used red wheat berries and ground them into flour with my mill.
2. I sifted out the husk to make the dough softer.
3.  I used 3 cups of the whole wheat flour but I added 3 tbsp of white all-purpose flour to put a little gluten in the flour to soften the dough.
4. I mixed the dough in my kitchen aid for 10 solid minutes to work the gluten into the dough.
*** all of these things were an addition to the original instructions ***

Don't have a bread maker. Kneaded it, let it rise for an hour, kneaded and shaped it, and let it rise for 30 mins. Baked at 350 for 40 mins.  It was delicious!

Four stars for revised version, based on other reviews. My first loaf was not good; it was too heavy, too dark, and too dry. Second loaf I subbed 1/2 cup of the flour with white bread flour, and added 1 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten. Then I baked it with a light crust setting. The results were a huge improvement. I do think my machine is baking it too long, though, so next time I’m shaving ten or fifteen minutes off the bake time, or I may try one reviewer’s advice to use the Basic (white bread) setting.

This bread is as delish as the honey wheat bread I buy from a local bakery.  Easy to make and you don't need a lot of ingredients. Did not change the recipe. I definitely will make it again.

Made  it using 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup all purpose flour,  1 tablesp vital wheat gluten.  I made it on my Panasonic SD255 machine.  I mixed the gluten and dried powdered milk with the flours as I was not sure when to add them.  I mixed the honey with the water as was not sure when to add it either.  The loaf came out quite small and the crust was darker than I like but it was delicous.  Good flavour and tender.  My bread machine is a UK one and does not give the option for a Small Loaf only, Medium, Large and XL.  My bread machine says to put the yeast in first and then the flour.  Any advice?

I was a little hesitant before whole wheat breads tend to be more dry and not taste great, albeit good for you.
I used butter instead of shortening and used the dough mode on my breadmaker and then after complete moved the bread to a regular loaf pan.  Baked it 25 minutes at 375 F.  
After it cooled slightly I cut a piece and put on a small amount of butter.
It was moist and delicious!
I can't think of anything to improve it.  I might make it into rolls next time.

We truly love the flavor of this bread. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would. The only thing we found that could be improved is the heaviness of the finished product. So, I made it again and used 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 c of  bread flour, and 0.5 cups of wheat germ. I also used butter instead of shortening. 

The results were outstanding! The bread was a bit lighter, very flavorful and the crust was perfect.

Use 3/4 cup water and 1/3 cup milk. Also, shortening can be replaced by butter or olive oil.

Made it exactly as written and it turned out amazing. I have an up to 2lb loaf capacity bread machine and I used the 1.5lb setting for this recipe because I couldn't find what setting to use and thats the setting I'm going to use in the future.

This is the bread I almost always make... Simple and healthy (I feel anyway). I replaced the wheat flour by Einkorn flour (ancestral wheat that was growing 10000 years ago) and it still works fine for me. I also took some buckweat honey from a local farm and replace the salt for some Himalayen pink salt. Still Good.
If you are wondering why the Einkorn flour, well I've been studying the question. And one interesting fact is that the wheat that we know today evolved a lot by some breading with other grass/plants for 10000 years. In fact it's genome (the genetic code of the Wheat) evolved to be composed of 3 different genome (it's called hexaploid because it has 6 chromosome, normally it should be only 2 [2 copies]). This leads, per example, to 3 different gluten molecules in todays wheat (and it's probably the same for a lot of other molecules. Also, I've read that the ancestral Eikorn had a lot lower glycemic index.
So all these changes were done in hope to have an even healthier bread. Because I love bread and I do not want to end up with a bread belly!!!

Tried several wheat bread recipes, this is my favorite.  Soft bread.  Stay fresh and soft for several days!  I use 1 C white flour in place of 1 C wheat.  I also use real honey from a Bee  Farm.

Best whole wheat bread I've ever made. Been looking for a recipe that tastes like Arnold 100% whole wheat bread which I used to buy regularly. Now I can make it better and save money at the same time. No artificial anything!  I added 1 Tablespoon VWG and use oil for shortening as usual. Thanks for this recipe. You didn't have to share, but you did! Thanks again.

Super moist and delicious! This recipe was a hit with my picky kids who do not love wheat breads. They raved about how soft and tender it was, instead of dry and tough like many can be. I made the recipe using my stand mixer. I followed the basics of breadmaking and proofed my yeast first, since I wasn't using a bread machine. As suggested by others, I also subbed 1/8 c milk for the 1/8 c water and left out the milk powder.

I have made this recipe many times. I use the bread maker on the dough setting, then place the dough in a bread pan, let it rise for 30-40 minutes in a warm location, and bake it at 350F for 30 minutes or until the interior temperature is 180 degrees. I have started replacing some of the honey with black strap molasses for additional nutrients. It is my "go to" whole wheat bread recipe.

My boys and I LOVE this bread!  It makes THE BEST grilled sandwiches!  I also love it topped with tuna!  The sweetness is divine!  My husband thinks it is too sweet, and says it is more of a dessert bread.  To each his own.  We use Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and that taste of coconut in the bread is amazing!  I make this bread 2-3 times a week.

I was looking for a good recipe for a whole wheat bread without white flour and found this one. It turns out soft and yummy and will be one of my top go-to recipes for making bread from now on.

I'v made this  5 times now and we love it. The 1st loaf I followed recipe exactly, it was good but dense. Every loaf that I have made since I have used 2c whole wheat and 1c all-purpose and it's the way we like it best. Definitely recommend!

I truly adore this bread. I always sub butter for the shortening and one cup bread flour for the last cup of wheat flour, but that is just my family's preference. I have made it with all wheat and it's delicious that way, as well. On my bread machine, I use the 1.5 lb. loaf size and the wheat setting with the lightest crust option. The result is dense and moist and makes an excellent everyday bread for toast and PB&J in our house. I make several loaves a week. Have not tried freezing it, because it never lasts that long! Thanks for a great basic wheat bread recipe!

The only change i made was i used butter instead of shortening as i didn't have any on hand, otherwise made as the recipe stated. I always put liquids & salt in first followed by flour then the yeast on top.  Came out beautiful and soft.  Perfect amount of sweetness.  Will definitely make again.

I really love this bread recipe. This has become my "house honey wheat" bread. The honey keeps the bread moist and chewy with good flavor. I use 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 a cup of King Arthur white (unbleached) bread flour. This substitution yields a lighter whole wheat bread that's a bit crispier when toasted. I use my oven as a proofing box. While the oven  is preheating, I split the top and brush with butter. Twice while baking, I throw a small handful of water into the oven.

I made this three times with two different yeasts and using both the basic and whole wheat settings on my machine. I also tried adding three tablespoons of wheat gluten. The bread is fine, but it was very dense no matter what I tried. I won't be making it again.

Made this for the first time yesterday (and it's been years since I made bread) - came out looking just like the picture and tasted even better.  Since my husband and I are both on WW, I was able to slice it quite thin and it held together well. Very happy.  The only thing I would change, and probably will next time I make a batch, is to use either Truvia Blend vice honey, or limit the honey only to the first part of the recipe so that it isn't quite as sweet.

I've been making white bread every day for years because my family loves it.  This is the first wheat bread that they begged me to make again.  It is noticeably sweeter than most wheat breads I have made but made with honey so I don't feel guilty.  Loved it!!

This WAS a wee bit heavy, but I just figure it's nothing since it's so tasty!  I added crystalized fruit and raisins... Oh! Also, I had to add quite a lot more flour to get it to the right consistency, so... IDK if it's a moisture thing or if anyone else had this issue or if the recipe really is low on flour, so... If you use a bread making machine, like we do, make sure to check on the dough and adjust if necessary!

Love this recipe – and so did the people I shared it with – big hit. I read a lot of reviews – used a few modifications. Had molasses on hand – so used it half with honey. I was short on time – so it only got a little more than an hour for second rise – next time I’ll give it at least 2 hours to rise. Regardless – the dinner I made it for – everyone had more than one piece! There is one regular on our weekly prayer meeting with dinner at the end – who is a bread monster (instead of cookie monster) – he took half the loaf! 9/8/15 - I have made this several times since the first - I also add cinnamon, and a couple of teaspoons of vital wheat gluten to aid in rising.

This bread turned out better than I expected, because I was out of white flour.  I had to use all whole wheat.  I did,  however, add wheat gluten. This loaf had good texture and a slightly crunchy crust. It was slightly dry, so I think next time I'll substitute a milk product for part of the water.

I have made lots of different breads over the years but like some others here I found this particular recipe a disappointment. It may have tasted ok but it came out like a brick so it went straight to the compost bin.

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe i have found!  It is sweet, and moist.  My kids love it.  Even my husband eats it!  I follow the recipe exactly and get amazing results each time!

Good ole wheat bread.  So much better than the wheat bread in the store with all the extra ingredients you can no idea what they are.

This is the only recipe I've made in the bread machine that slices perfectly. Not crumby and doesn't fall apart, just perfect sandwich slices every time.

A good full grain bread.  First loaf turned out a little dry and heavy for our taste.  On 2nd loaf I used 1 Cup bread flour and 2 Cups whole wheat and added an additional 1/4 cup honey during the last kneeding cycle. Turned out GREAT.  Definitely will make again and again.  May add raisins or toasted pine nuts to the next loaf.

Made this recipe today and took the advise of 1 review, substituting 1/2 c. of bread flour.  I made in my bread machine and it turned out excellent!  Moist with a great texture.  I will definitely be making it again.

Love this recipe.   I double it and make it in my KitchenAid.   It is fantastic!    I do use vital wheat gluten to help with the rising. I use coconut oil and 1/4 cup warm milk and 2 cups water instead of the powdered milk - because I always have milk on hand.

I gave this one four stars instead of five because I altered/added some things (and changed to 16 servings for my breadmaker).  First, I used a whole package of dry yeast, added four teaspoons of gluten, and changed the honey content to one cup.  I used 3 1/2c of whole wheat and 1/2c of bread flour and substituted butter for shortening. When the alert sounded on by bread machine, I added one cup of rolling oats! Beautiful bread and wonderful taste.  The next time I think I will add 1/4 brown sugar just to turn up the volume just a tad.  I will do this one again and will be baking one for my neighbor tomorrow. . .

This makes a good whole wheat bread.  I didn't have quite enough honey and used butter instead of shortening. I made the dough in my bread maker and then transferred to a greased pan and let rise 30 min.  Baked at 350 for 30 min. I'm very pleased with the results!

I make this bread once a week and we love it.  I use the hints from Flannery and add wheat gluten and bake on regular setting and light crust.  These suggestions make all the difference.

Excellent, best whole wheat loaf I have made yet.  The first time, I used the whole wheat setting and it came out a little too dense with a very hard crust.  However, the second time, I followed another reviewer's advice and used my basic setting with a light crust and it came out perfect.  I added about a tablespoon of fresh chopped rosemary for some flavor.  Yum.

I have XY chromosomes, made this recipe and it still tasted fantastic!  Followed the instructions to combine all dry ingredients and put the salt with the liquids and it turned out great.  I also put in 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons of shortening.  This is now a staple at our house.

I have been looking for a better whole wheat bread recipe and this is my favorite!  My kids love it, too, which makes me very happy.  It reminds me of bread I use to get at a cafe I use to go to.

Great bread, lighter than I expected WW bread to be (but that's a good thing!).  Holds up well too (I don't like it when homemade bread drops crumbs everywhere).  :)

I use 1.5 cups white bread flour and 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, instead of all whole wheat.  I follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  By far, this is the tastiest homemade bread I have ever tried!  The texture is superb.

Easy recipe and by far the best I've found for a 100% whole wheat loaf thus far.  I make it weekly for our family.  I've always had consistent loaves of bread.  We use it for everything - toast, sandwiches, etc.  It is a hearty loaf, so we often only use one slice at a time now.  There are sometimes I wish it wasn't quite so sweet - but honey is in the name.  Very good!!!

For wheat bread, this was really good.  I wasn't home when the bread finished in the bread maker, so the edges got a little crispy, but the inside was still good.  I omitted the dry milk powder and used olive oil instead of shortening.  Other than that, I followed everything else exactly. It was super easy and I will definitely make it again.

I have a Regal bread machine, the whole wheat setting, even on light crust, burns this bread, however, if I remove the burned crust, the bread is quite good.  Lightly sweet, good consistency, perfect sandwich and toast bread.  I'll try it again on the basic setting with light crust.

This bread was easy and delicious!  I subbed 1 cup of bread flour to make it lighter, put 50/50 honey & agave nectar (ran out of honey).  I used liquid non-dairy creamer for the dried milk to keep it parve.  I put the machine on the "light" setting.  Turned out a moist and very delicious loaf!  Next time I will try keeping all ww, using extra gluten to keep it light.  Delicious!  Thanks!

An excellent wheat bread recipe!  I didn't have shortening so used 1 and 1/2 T of vegetable oil instead.  Crust came out a little dark on my machine which I set at whole wheat and medium; will use the light crust setting in the future.  While the recipe is great as is, it still is somewhat dense.  I tried a batch using 2.5 teaspoons of yeast and it was lighter and higher; I love it with the change!

I'll have to retry this..I made a horrible error that I just noticed. I wrote down the recipe and I put in 1 1/2 CUPS of shorting instead of tablespoons. Haha. I was very butter and a brick. So we'll give it another shot.   I'm sure it will be delicious.

This bread is the best one I've ever tasted! It's so soft and sweet. Because it's so sweet, we're making this bread forever. We added it to our recipe box! What about you? You should like it and add it to your recipe box.

This was only the second, entirely whole wheat loaf I have made in the bread machine that *wasn't* a doorstop.  What a wonderful texture and flavor!  I made this tonight, and 2 hours later there is so little left that I will need to make more tomorrow!  I didn't have any shortening, and we're trying to eat a little healthier anyway, so I used applesauce in its place, same amount.  I was a bit worried about the substitution, but it turned out absolutely fabulous.  I used the whole wheat, medium crust, large loaf (for my bread machine, apparently 1.5 lb is a large loaf) settings, which ended up being a total of 3 hr 55 min, and it was perfect.  Definitely a keeper in this household!

Very tasty bread, and very easy to make, but I did reduce the recipe by 1/3 to make a smaller loaf.  I did not reduce the yeast, and I added 2 teaspoons wheat gluten.

Honey adds just the right amount of sweetness. The first time I made this, it was a small dense loaf - though very yummy- so on the second go round, I added 3 Tbs Vital Wheat Gluten and did as another reviewer said, to add salt with liquid ingredients. Loaf turned out much fluffier and light! I also set my machine for Whole Wheat setting with Light Crust selected. This has become  my go to recipe for bread machine whole wheat bread!

I really like this recipe and I don't like wheat bread all that much, though I know it's healthier so I try to eat it. Makes great toast, and the honey makes it kind of sweet, cancels out that bitter wheat taste. I substituted one cup of bread flour for one cup of the wheat and 1/2 cup of milk for 1/2 c of the water and dry milk, because I didn't have any dry milk.

I made this without a bread machine and it turned out great.  I didn't increase the honey or salt as other users recommended and still found it delicious.  A perfectly textured crust and deliciously soft center.  Nothing beats homemade whole wheat bread!

pretty darn good bread, considering it's entirely whole wheat. i made a variation on the original recipe by adding an egg, decreasing liquid slightly, using coconut oil for shortening (no trans fats), and adding 2 tsp. caraway seeds, 2 tsp. sesame seeds, 1 tsp. rubbed sage, and 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg.

My husband said "This is the best bread you've made yet." I don't like the shape of bread in the breadmaker, so I used the dough setting and broke it out into smaller loaves before baking. The dough seemed very wet but the end product was soft and delicious! I used more milk powder than I was meant to (some spilled...) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Great Bread!  I've tried it with all whole wheat flour, part whole wheat / part white bread flour and whole wheat flour with wheat gluten.  It was great all three ways, but the loaf was a little uneven the time I used just whole wheat flour.

This is my favorite WW bread so far.  I've only been making bread for >90 days.  Now I am experimenting with rising it in the pan and baking it instead of baking it in my bread machine.  MY MINOR CHANGES:  I, too, use 1/8c. milk and 1c. water... I use butter instead of oil and I add 3T of gluten and try to use local honey - that tastes the best.  I LOVE the trick to melt the butter in the 1/3c. measurement and then use the "greased" cup when measuring my honey...works better with oil, but butter tastes better so that's what I'm going to use :)  I bake on "1.5 lb. white, light crust" setting when I use my bread maker.  Thank you MelH for posting this delicious recipe!

this bread had a good texture, the only thing I changed was the shortening to butter. I think butter is always a better replacement to shortening.

Light and fluffy and worked really well even for sandwiches.  I didn't bake it in the bread machine but instead put it on the manual setting to mix and then put it in a loaf pan in the oven. I think it turns out lighter that way. I agree it was a little salty so next time will add a little less salt.

This was my second recipe with my newly-acquired bread-machine. Modified the recipe as suggested by Flannery. It came out perfect. The crust is not hard and the inside is soft and chewy. Half the loaf was gone before I could put it away. I will definitely bake this again.

A little bland, but lots of potential.  My electricity went out the first time I made it, so it came out all flat, and then the second time I made it (the next day) the top was concave.  I think I'm going to just make a loaf and shape it by hand next time, I don't usually use the bread machine to bake, and I'm starting to remember why.  I recommend doing the entire rise cycle twice, it really improves the texture for me.  I added a handful of rolled oats, 1/4 cup of wheat germ, 1/4 cup of milled flax seed, and 2 tbsp gluten.  I think it needs a little more salt.

Despite my many failed efforts at using my bread maker to make bread, this recipe is awesome and came out great. I used 1 cup of white bread flour and 2 cups wheat bread flour, and used butter instead of shortening, and it came out fantastic. Definitely a recipe that I will use again- and soon! THank you for sharing it!

Very good...although this is my 3 or so time making it, the last two times I've added about 1 c more of flour!  I don't remember doing that before.
It still tastes great, so I guess the cup more doesn't harm it!
Note to self:
add wet + salt (110 degrees)
mix all dry (except yeast)

I think next time I make it I will add a little more yeast (as others have suggested) and may replace half of the whole wheat flour with white flour.

I used the top reviewer's suggestions (added wheat gluten, baked on basic, light crust) and I got a loaf that had an ok taste but crust was so bad it had to be cut off, and also the consistency was too heavy.  I will not make this again but will keep looking for better.

I haven't purchased any bread from the store in a month.  We use this as our everyday bread.  It is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This my daughters favorite bread.  Whenever I try other recipes she always asks if I'm going to still make this one. Have a batch in the machine right now.

Fantastic. I subbed 1/2 cup of bread flour instead of using all whole wheat flour, as stated in another review.  I did not use any gluten as indicated in some reviews. It came out perfect as is. This is by far the best bread I have made with my bread machine.

Very good bread - light and tasty.  I used olive oil instead of shortening, 3 Tbl molasses in place of honey, and 1 tsp salt.

Rated this 4 stars because this bread is BEAUTIFUL, but I did make a couple of modifications. I use canola oil instead of shortening, and I add 3 Tbsp. of vital wheat gluten to my dry ingredients. My husband takes a sandwich every day for lunch and RAVES about this bread. He is sad if I forget to make it and we have to buy bread at the store (at least $5 for something edible! Ridiculous!) This one's a keeper!

Thank you thank you!  I moved from a high elevation (7000 feet) to a low elevation (1000 feet), and this is the only recipe I can get to work in my machine.  MMMM even my little toddlers love it.

I love this recipe! It turned out light and delicious. After searching for a good breadmaker recipe for whole wheat bread I've been disappointed in my past results but after trying this recipe my search is over. Thanks for posting!

Wow, great recipe! First time I used the bread machine. I substituted butter for the shortening, brown sugar for the honey. Skipped the skim milk powder. I would reduce the sugar and salt next time. Set the machine on whole wheat and light crust. Turned out perfect!

This was by far the best whole wheat bread I've made. I've tried several others, but this one was the unanimous favorite.  My kids and husband loved it.

Thanks so much for this recipe.  Makes a beautiful loaf.  I multiplied by 1.5 to make a Roman Meal sized loaf, worked great.  I ommitted the shortening, and used only olive oil.  Used 1/8 cup milk instead of water and didn't use powdered.  Used only 1 t. salt. (these measurements for regular recipe amounts)  Takes longer to rise, so give it time.  Kids loved it!  Will be our daily bread for a long time, I think!  350 ~25 min.

This is a nice bread recipe, and I like that it actually uses all wheat flour.  I've made it twice. The first time I made it in the the bread machine and it came out really hard and yucky.  No clue what I did wrong!  The next time, I just made the dough in the bread machine and then I let it rise for another hour and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes.  Much better result.  It was a tad crumbly, which made it a little harder to eat, but we still enjoyed it very much.

Very good bread! I made the dough in my breadmaker and then transfered it to a bread pan to rise and bake in the oven. It turned out perfect and tastes wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed this recipe very closely except I did add 3 Tablespoons of wheat gluten as others had suggested. I also used canola oil instead of shortening. I have a Chefmate breadmaker and used the basic regular crust setting. The bread is very dense and absolutely delicious. It has a slight sweetness to it and I thought it was perfect. I packed it in my daughter's lunch with a little peanut butter and she raved about it after school. No more store bought bread for us!!!

5 stars for flavor!  4 stars for texture. It turned out a little dry, but I always seem to have problems making bread.  I will definitely use this recipe again because the flavor is great.

I've been making this bread for 10 years now. It's the same recipe I found in a cookbook when I was first married. We love it. The kids like to eat it when it first comes out of the oven.

Good but the loaf split on the diagonal when cut.  It was moist but still grainy.  I'll make it again but it may be a little TOO whole wheat for my family.

Nifty.  It tastes great, but I would dearly love to know why it came out lopsided in my machine.  Someone else mentioned the same thing.  Eh, we'll just use it for club sandwiches!  Good texture, good flavor. . .used the gluten and butter.

I goofed this up and it still turned out great.  I forgot to put my kneading paddle in the machine, of all things. It's like driving without wheels, you're not going to get very far.  Couldn't understand why the flour etc. wasn't moving and mixing.  Duh. It was late.  I yanked the pan out of the machine sending some of the flour/yeast flying, crammed my kneading paddle in there on top of everything and prayed, hard.  It came out a slightly denser bread, but delicious.  I also added 3 Tbs. of vital wheat gluten per several reviewers suggestions.  The bread was amazing when toasted, buttered and honeyed.  Will use this one frequently, WITH my kneading paddle firmly in place.

Wonderful whole wheat bread. I made 2 minor changes & 1 omission, but bread still turned out perfectly. I didn't have any shortening so substituted w/ butter & I had to leave out the milk powder because I didn't have any. Also used 1 cup of unbleached bread flour in place of one of the cups of whole wheat. Bread was great and sliced wonderfully.

I had to slice this as soon as it came out of the oven and smear it with butter because it smelled so good while it was baking.  It was heavenly. I made this bread with the changes that others suggested - 2 c whole wheat flour and 1 c bread flour, 1/4 c honey, butter instead of shortening and added 2 T of vital wheat gluten.  I only used the breadmaker for mixing and rising.  This has just replaced any other wheat bread recipe that I have used in the past.  It's soft, light textured, baked evenly with good rise.  Just perfect.

I really liked this recipe, however I plan on doubling the soup mix and water the next time around. I felt there wasn't enough "gravy" for all the noodles! I may cut the noodles by half too. I through a bunch away.

This was super delicious! In making it, I used 2 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour, and I substituted butter for the shortening. I put it on the dough setting in the bread machine, then took it out, formed two loaves, let those rise for about an hour, and then baked them for 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven. They came out perfectly done!It didnt rise as much as you usually expect bread to, but that was totally fine...the taste made up for it!!!

For some strange reason my scale was set to 18 and so I used 4 1/2 cups flour and more of everything else. A great mistake as it was the best loaf ever in texture, appearance, size and taste!! I omitted the skim milk powder as I didn't have any. Also used the basic setting as other reviewers suggested. Even my husband who normally hates whole wheat loved this one.

This bread will be going on our favorites list. It was very tasty. Even my VERY picky DH ate this bread. I did do as suggested and replaced 1/2 cup of Whole Wheat with All Purpose flour, used butter instead of shortening, and used the Basic setting instead of Whole Wheat setting. It was very good and we will make this again!!

I loved this recipe.  I just made a  grilled cheese sandwich with it and it was delicious.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It was kind of sweet from the honey.  I like that there is no sugar or white flour in it.  I made this exactly according to the recipe, but I added some ground flax seed last.  I listened to some reviews and set it on light and 1 1/2 lb.  It turned out perfect.

I couldn't believe that my kids would eat this bread!  It is delicious and an excellent recipe.  The whole loaf is usually gone within an hour of coming out of the bread machine.  I sub margarine for the shortening.

I have tried many whole wheat bread recipes and none of them have been this fluffy, light and with such a great taste!!
The only things I did different than the original recipe is I didn't add the dry milk powder and I added 3 TBSP of gluten.

This wheat bread is fabulous! I did add 1 1/2 TB gluten and doubled the milk powder (just a preference on both) and rounded the shortening to 2 TB. It was soft, smooth, sweet and all around delicious. A great bread for sandwiches, toast or fresh and hot with a meal. TRY this bread!

I followed the directions exactly and it just didn't turn out right. It was very thick and heavy, I tried a different recipe right away and it was fine, so I don't know what went wrong. It tasted good, it was just like eating a brick though. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated (except I added some vital wheat gluten) and turned the machine on the whole wheat cycle, and it came out as an undercooked gob.

Very good!  I use this recipe often with the recommended dividing bread flour and wheat flour.  Thank you for this healthy recipe.

I never got a chance to try this recipe, there was no dough, it was crumbs in my bread machine, the fluid amount has to be wrong

This is the best recipe for whole wheat bread. I make minor modifications to the recipe by adding gluten and dough enhancer. Finally, a whole wheat bread recipe that isn't crumbly when sliced and SO delicious.

This is the first recipe I used in a bread-maker received for the holiday season.  I appreciate its hearty texture and lightly sweet flavor.  I placed the setting to medium, which perhaps may have dried out the dough a bit; nonetheless, it was a delicious compliment to a winter salad.  Appreciation.

We loved this bread! It was slightly sweet, soft and slightly dense, and healthy. I followed this recipe almost exactly but used the basic bread setting instead of wheat as another reviewer suggested. I also used heart healthy margerine and a little less salt. Delicious!

Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!!! I did as suggested by previous reviews--I made the dough in the bread machine then baked them in loaf pans. My husband, who does not like wheat bread, ate an entire loaf by himself!

This is the perfect recipe- easy, healthy, and delicious!  I have made this bread countless times and everyone who tastes it loves it, even my persnickety mother.  The bread is dense, sweet, and flavorful.  We love that it calls for only wheat flour.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  This was my first attempt at making a whole-wheat bread and it was successful!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  It turned out moist, easy to cut, and with the best flavor.  I did do as others suggested and just used the dough setting in bread machine then put it in the oven.  Thanks again.

I read all the reviews to get the best advice and could see this was a versatile recipe.  I took reviewers advice and used 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup of white flour. Not one to leave a recipe be, we added 1/4 c. of sunflower seeds to this loaf and have to say that was a great addition.  The loaf had the right density and texture we love, but it was a bit sweet.  A little adjustment and this will be perfect.  Thanks for sharing this one.

My DH and me love it!  I just changed a litle bit.  for 24 portions, I used 3 cups of rye flour and 3 of whole wheat.  And a extra 1/3 of water and just 1/3  of honey.

I've been looking for a wheat bread recipe that didn't require white flour and now I have found it!  I didn't change a thing in testing it and the bread was soft and moist and it rose up just right.  It was a tad bit too sweet for our family, so I will use less honey next time.  Great Recipe!

Nice and moist, but a bit too dense and way too sweet for sandwiches.  It collapsed a bit on me, so if I were to make it again I would decrease the water or add more flour.

Very, very good.  I've never had much luck with whole wheat bread for the bread machine...usually comes out too dry. This recipe, however, was as good or better than expensive store bought loaves.  It's dense, and moist, and flavorful.  Thank you.  I'll be using this recipe often.

Came out awesome!!  I used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 bread flour and it was perfect.  Wheat, medium crust setting.  Great for sandwiches!  Slices great with a electric meat knife. Husband is a big fan of this bread!

This turned out really good.  I made a couple changes...I didn't have any milk powder, so I left that out and I didn't have honey, so I used maple syrup.  I think I'll add some nuts next time.  I will make this again.

Came out very thick and dense.  Unlike any honey wheat bread I had ever seen before.  All my ingredients were purchased fairly recently.  The only thing I did different was subsitute butter for shortening.  It was a disappointment.

May have been user error, but this bread just did not come out as expected. It rose but was very heavy. I followed all settings as per manufacturer. I'm giving it 3 stars for the benefit of the doubt. Just didn't taste a whole lot like honey wheat to me.

I borrowed an Oster Expressbake machine from a friend and made this in Florida.  When I came home I purchased the same machine (on ebay) and tried the bread.  It is not rising and is not as light as when made in Florida.  I have purchased new flour, but still not rising.  I am using breadmachine yeast where down there I used packaged yeast, would this make a difference??? Help,,,I love this bread!!!

My first batch failed miserably, but that was probably my fault.  The second batch was wonderful and tasted great.  I loved the mild honey flavor.  I did use one cup of white flour and did not use milk since I did not have any.

This is the best tasting whole wheat "bread machine" bread I've made so far.  The honey makes this bread great.  Easy - fast and delicious.  WONDERFUL toasted.

I'd been having trouble with my wheat bread being too heavy.  This recipe was great.

So yummy!  I did take a little advice after reading the reviews and substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour with bread flour.  Can't wait to make again.

Easy and simple. I accidently misread the recipe and added 1  and 1/2 CUPS shoretining. Heh,  but it turned out great the same. I put the setting on French. Great Recipe!

This was a real winner. I'm new to breadmaking & this recipe made me look a pro! It had lots of flavor & texture....dreamy with some butter & a drizzle of honey. Thank you for a lovely recipe.

This bread is delicious - very dense, though. No light and fluffy here, very moist.

I used bread machine yeast and dough enhancer and it was by far the best bread I've ever made.

This bread is so delicious! It doesn't last long in our house. I used my bread machine to mix the dough, then baked it in the oven and when done, basted a little butter on the top. It's like candy! (Especially with homemade strawberry jam...mmmmmmm!)

Good healthy bread, turned out okay except the crust was really dark for medium.  Next, Ill do it light.  My 2 yr old loves this bread.
