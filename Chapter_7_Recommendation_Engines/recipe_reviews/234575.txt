This is really good and super easy! I also added garlic powder and Italian seasoning and I baked at 375 for around 30 min. This is so much better than other "just a few ingredients" pizza bake recipes I've tried!

Made this recipe today and it was pretty good. It did need more flavor so I added 1 tsp. hot sauce, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I also put pepperoni, onion and bacon on it.  I baked it at 350* for 35 minutes. Will be making it again soon.

This is a great recipe to customize, but is pretty bland as written. I topped it with ingredients we normally have on our pizza such as extra pepperoni, sausage medallions, peppers, red onion and mushrooms. When I tossed the sauce and cheese with the biscuits I also added some salt, pepper, garlic and Italian seasoning. After baking 20 mins it still seemed doughy so I put it on broil for 5 minutes which also allowed the cheese to get nice and brown. With these modifications the recipe was so delicious and even my extremely picky husband loved it. I was skeptical about making a pizza with biscuits, but they made such a phenomenal base. Next time I will cook even longer because it was still a bit doughy, but definitely still edible.

My daughter has play practices every day after school this week, leaving her a very limited amount of time before bed in which to do homework, eat, and shower. This recipe was great last night. The only change I made was to add some black olives to the toppings. I got the casserole assembled before leaving to get my daughter from practice, and had the oven preheat while I was gone. It was all ready for me to just pop in the oven after we got back, and baked while she got some math homework done. This recipe is simple enough that my 13 year old novice chef was able to easily help. The only suggestion I have is that the cooking time is not long enough, and as 8 oz containers of pizza sauce are difficult to come by, there is some unnecessary waste involved. Next time I will be sure to double the recipe to make two of these, and bake them for 30 minutes.

I believe this a case of varying tastes buds. I feel like the biscuit flavor overpowered the pizza sauce and toppings.  I did my first pizza in 9x11 glassware. There were complaints from the peanut gallery that the crust was too thick.  I spread my 2nd pizza onto a cookie sheet and (half of) the peanut gallery was much happier with a thinner crust. My peanut gallery consists of 4 kids with me always being the 5th.  the vote was 3 who didn't care for it and 2 who liked it (with a thinner crust).

I've made this many times, following the directions to the letter, and it's always come out uncooked in the middle. Made it this afternoon, and cooked it 18-20 minutes at 425Â°F in a 10x10 pan, and it came out perfect. Pastorelli pizza sauce works best for me. Seasoned, and comes in an 8 oz can.

If I make this again, I may bake it a bit longer. The biscuit pieces were doughy after 20 minutes, although the hubby said he liked them that way. I added crumbled bacon and sliced black olives, plus pizza/pasta seasoning and garlic powder.

This is a great easy recipe.  It is very easy and quick to make and easy to adapt to your tastes. As written the recipe could probably use more flavor but it easy to adapt any pizza inspired meal to suit individual tastes!

The flavor was quite good.  It reminded me of the pizza pockets I make using crescent rolls. Like previous reviewers, I added garlic powder and italian seasoning. I did end up baking it longer than suggested because it came out really doughy.  That is really my only complaint--the fact that it's a little doughy.

This recipe is great and fast but it was slightly bland so you may want to add some bacon meat or pinnaple to it and its awesome! This is what I will do for whenever we need to make    something fast!

Super easy and good! Had to cook longer than 20 minutes though. Very doughy with only 20 minutes cooking time.

Much better than expected. Just wanted to use up a leftover biscuit can and found this recipe - surprised how well it turned out. Very tasty, added about 6 ounces extra sauce and some extra pepperoni.

This is great as is.  OR--you can use the cheaper biscuits (2 cans).  You can add any toppings you want!   We like the Classico pizza sauce, which is 14 oz., and I use 1 /2 jars and freeze the other 1/2 jar for next time.  We also like extra shredded mozzarella (2 c.).  Tonight's toppings are pepperoni on half with thawed green peppers/onions and mushrooms on the other half.  The kids love it and can put it together themselves.  I may try another reviewer's suggestion and use pizza crust, just out of curiosity.  Baking at  375Â° works for us.

Yep, needs cooked longer. Doughy! I might make again and cook longer. Always read reviews before making any recipe. It has potential if cooked right.

Made two Cooked them for 20 minutes, added mushrooms peppers and onions to one and just cheese and pepperoni and sauce to the other ... The loved ones enjoyed it but I thought it tasted too much like biscuits next time I will make it with pizza dough... Everyone else  enjoyed it so will make again with biscuits for them and pizza dough for me

Great recipe but, as another user recommended, it needs be cooked for 28-30 minutes
