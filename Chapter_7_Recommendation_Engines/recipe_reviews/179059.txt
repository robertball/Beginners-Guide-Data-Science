I made this using a pound of ground beef and used rotini pasta. To the beef i added a small chopped onion, salt/pepper, minced garlic, garlic powder and some italian seasoning and it came out so good! =) Will make again!!!

My husband was skeptical of this recipe but he had to admit it was really good. This is a keeper for us as there is no meat added.

This fit the bill when I needed to make something carb-a-licious at the last minute with a very limited pantry.  My only changes were to use 2 cups of cheese, add one can of diced tomatoes and a full box of pasta (which may or may not be 5 cups cooked).

I love the simplicity of this recipe. I use fresh mozzarella and I shred it myself, which I recommend over the pre-shredded stuff in the bag, it makes a big different in my opinion. I tossed some extra dried basil into the sauce. This is quick and easy!

I made this last night. I used penne pasta, and used a bit more cheese. I also added about 2 tablespoons of cottage cheese to the pasta sauce (as I do with lasagne). After I baked it I sprinkled it with parmesean cheese. I made it for 3 teenage boys, and their exact words were "this is amazing". Great meal!

I loved this recipe.  I used fresh cheeses and even took the time to grate them.  It is worth the prep time.  I also didn't use the recommended sauce....I used my own favorite traditional sauce.  I am totally making this again.  My husband also loved it.

Made this for dinner last night. It was quick and surpringly better than I was expecting.  I doubled the amount of cheese mixed in & used rigatoni pasta instead.  Leftover were very good today for lunch!

This was so easy to make and tasted GREAT! I added a little more cheese then what was called for, but that's because we're all cheese freaks in my house.

This is yummy.  Nothing too special about it, but add Aunt Mary's Eggplant Balls (from this site.) to them and it's very tasty.  They take the same temp and time in the oven.  So easy to put together.

As recipe is written here, it would get 2 stars, but with some changes, it has the potential for 3-4 stars.  We were looking for a vegetarian ziti, so we gave this a try & added extra mozzerella (2c total), stirred parmesan into the sauce, and added dried basil & garlic.  Next time I think we'll saute some onion, green pepper, & garlic together & stir into the sauce.  Also, I think we'd use a different brand sauce since this was a little sweet for our tastes.

I used 4 cups of mozzerella cheese and Ragu meat sauce and it turned out amazing! By far the best ziti I've ever had:)

Thanks for posting a recipe without meat or ricotta. I had neither and this came out well. Only difference is that I made my own sauce with crushed tomatoes, pepper, mushroom, garlic and basil. The sauce is important so make sure to use a kind you like.

I've made this recipe about 10 times. The first time I didn't change it & it was so easy & tasty! I use 2 cups of mozzarella when I mix the pasta and sauce together, then I add mini meatballs or sausage. I add more sauce to the top once I move to baking dish with extra mozzarella and the parmesan cheese - it helps the top not get crusty & hard when it cooks. Everyone is my family (of 7) likes this! I don't think my additions make it any more difficult to make and like I said it tastes reat plain too :)

I didn't have Prego so I used an organic basil marinara and I added italitan sausage (because I had to use it up before it spoiled).  It was delicious!!!!  I'm sure it would have been 5 stars without the Italian sausage.

Huge hit with my household! We've done it a couple of times. The second time I added twice the cheese (my husband loves cheese) and some seasonings (Italian).  I also diced an onion and threw in some caribou/beef.

I have made this twice in the last three weeks. It isn't everyday I find a recipe the whole family loves. Combining some sauce with the first layer of noodles is definitely a good idea. Delicious!

I added sauted ground beef & sausage to the prego sauce and used extra sharp white cheddar instead of mozzarella. It was so delicious!

Very bland as is. I sauteed zucchini, mushrooms, and onions and added that to the sauce. It was much better and was an easy way to add veggies.
