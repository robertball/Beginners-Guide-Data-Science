I was looking for a quick and easy dish to take to a patio party, and this was it! They were gone in minutes! I used a combination of rice vinegar and red wine vinegar, and added a few more dashes of Tabasco sauce the next day after tasting. I also left the onions in slices to marinate, then removed them before serving so the aroma wouldn't knock everyone over. Great appetizer/party recipe - thanks Sara!

I had something similar to this at a recent wedding, so I was very excited to try this. 

I used the basic recipe, but I can never leave anything alone.  I taste-tested a shrimp about halfway through the marinating time, and it seemed to need a little zip, so I added the juice of one lemon, some chopped green onions, and a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper (we like spicy).  Perfect!  This is great as an appetizer, or as a main course on these hot, steamy days.  My husband liked it so much he asked me to make it when his family comes to visit next month!

This was easy and delicious. Like another reviewer, I left the onions in slices and removed them before serving. I did also add green onions and the juice of one lemon. Served over ice with cocktail sauce. (Also, I forgot and bought shrimp with tails ON...worked great)

Really good appetizer-very easy to make-It only marinated for about 5 hours but had a good flavor-I used Tiger sauce(a Louisiana product) for the hot sauce and think I'll add more than the 2 tsp next time.

Just a wonderful recipe. It's a great way to defrost frozen cleaned jumbo shrimps. I pour the mixture over the shrimp in a gallon size zipper bag. Put in the fridge overnight. Take out the fridge at least 15 minutes before serving. Very good on lettuce with cocktail sauce.

This was ok, not as much flavor as I hoped. I made it with a combination of white balsamic and apple cider vinegars. I wouldn't make this again. Thanks anyway.

I used this as a marinade for peeled raw shrimp and everyone LOVED it.  I marinated it overnight in the fridge and cooked the shrimp skewered on the grill.  Excellent!!  I am thinking of trying this as a chicken marinade as well.

I made this like it says, but used balsamic vinegar instead to punch it up some and then I took half of the shrimp and added pineapple juice.  I got rave reviews! thanks

Extremely easy and good - depending on the crowd, you may want to leave the onions chopped rather on the large side so that those who aren't fans can avoid them more easily. (Not a problem for those of us who like them, though, as the marinade really flavors them well.)  ALSO:  the leftovers are excellent on salad, the marinade is a essentially a vinaigrette dressing on its own...

This was easy, but not very good, unless you like your shrimp to taste like vinegar & smell like onion! I won't make it again

I followed this recipe exactly as stated. If you like your onion to totally overpower the shrimp this is for you, I guess. Otherwise it was very bland.  Maybe I didn't use the right kind of hot sauce because this was not hot at all. Out of the 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp called for in the recipe, I had just shy of 1 lb left after my guests left. Guess that tells you what they thought of it also, huh?  I'll stick to Chipolte Shrimp or Rebel Angels from this site, thank you!!!

This was very good and simple to prepare the night before for either a lunch salad or a nice appetizer. I didn't have celery seed so I used celery salt instead and didn't add the extra salt the recipe called for.

Outstanding. Making it again tonight. I did not have regular hot sauce so I substituted some sauce I purchased from Grand Cayman on our last cruise. YUM.

Very easy and great recipe! Living in Florida, I'm always looking for something different to do with shrimp. I first made these for a party about 3 years ago, and I'd say I've been asked to bring this shrimp to gatherings at least 10 times since then...especially nice because it's a "make-ahead" appetizer and can be done even up to 2 days before serving.  Thanks for submitting it, it's a winner.

This recipe became better after heating the shrimp up. I used white wine vinegar, and it was too bitter and over powering. The marinade sweetened up a bit after cooking. I'd recommend using raw shrimp and grilling them. Will that next time.
