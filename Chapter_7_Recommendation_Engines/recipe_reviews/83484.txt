Very good base to start from.  I used cream of chicken soup and some sour cream instead of the salad dressing.  Also used corn tortillas, as that's what I've always used for enchiladas.  Recipe still needs some tweaking.

This recipe was delicious, although a bit rich.  The ingredients blended well together and it tasted awesome - didn't last long at all.  My husband actually said he'd prefer eating these to eating a steak.  (If you like this recipe, you'll also likely really enjoy Creamy Chicken Lasagna from this site).  This is definitely a keeper.

We all love these enchiladas -  even my toddlers can't get enough! I like the creamy option, rather than a tomato base. I use mayonnaise instead of slaw dressing and cheddar instead of monterey, since ingredients are different in Australia. Now this recipe is one of my most requested... even my friends ask me to make this for them!!

for my first time making enchilads this is the most easiest recipe i've seen. I made several changes though and almost adapted it to my own recipe. Brocoli, onion and garlic is what i added to the feeling. I also added sour cream into the cream cheese mixture and made sure that the cream cheese was pretty much warm. I also added ceaser dressing instead of that slaw stuf cause i never heard of it and that's what i had laying around. I also finished the dish off with mozerella cheese and covered it at 400 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes. it came out really good:)

Oh my goodness, I can't believe this recipe only has 4 out of 5 stars! My boyfriend made this dish, and six of his room mate's friend's came over---people were begging him for plate after plate. The dish was gone in an hour. I will make it over and over again.

Super Delish! I used sour cream instead of the dressing, and my roommate and sister couldn't say enough good things about it! All I could hear was the sound of chewing, and 'MMmmmmm....'

this was easy and delicious. My husband said in was as good as anything he has had at a restaurant and wondered why I had never made this before. (married 11 years). Even my 2 1/2 year old ate the inside of the enchiladas, she liked the "cheesy chicken".
Will definately make this again. I did add some roasted bell peppers to the fillinbg, umm.

Being from Texas I know how to make good enchiladas, so I have to give this 5 stars! This was a great recipe! As most readers/reviewers have said...I would cut down the slaw dressing... otherwise everyone absolutely LOVED them! Plan to make these again and again!

I made these lastnight for dinner, and I must say that they were quite good. But, i would prefer the white sauce instead of the salsa. Although i have no idea how to make it. I will be sticking with this recipe until i figure out how to make the white sauce. Oh, Instead of using slaw, i used sour cream and it turned out AWSOME!

My family loved this easy recipe! Instead of the dressing I used the cream cheese with 1/2 cup of the soup and salsa mixture.  I used green salsa instead of red salsa since my family loves green verde enchiladas!  I served sour cream as a topping for them and the whole pan was gone!! Great recipe without the DRESSING!!!

I did not care for this recipe. They tasted like sweet chicken salad. I do not recommend even attempting them. I have no idea how people think they even passed for an enchilada.

Very good! I wasn't too sure about the taste of the mushroom soup/salsa mixture, but my husband thought it was good. Next time may try cream of chicken soup.

I loved this recipe.  Just like another review, I used sour cream instead of the dressing.  Also, just on a whim, I used a salsa verde...which spiced it up in a different way.  Overall, what an AWESOME recipe!!

I have made these many times using the Marzetti slaw dressing and replacing it with sour cream.  I tend to like it better with the sour cream but that could just be me.  Either way everyone loves them.  Oh, I always use home made tortillas which I think adds a lot to the overall quality of the dish.

Not so good. The slaw dressing added a sweetness that we just didn't particularly care for. Enchiladas are not supposed to be sweet.

Delicious and easy. My favorite things! I used sour cream instead of the slaw dressing as another review suggested. Also used cream of chicken soup and mixed some in with the filling. This was a delicious recipe. Have also made it vegetarian style and it is equally as good with cream of mushroom soup. Thanks for a great recipe. We eat this often.

It was ok. I thought we would like the zippyness of the sauce, but to me it never blended? I won't make this again.

I made this a few weeks ago.  My fiancee (now recent husband) loved it!  The Marzetti slaw dressing is key--it gives it a tangy flavor!  He brought leftovers to work the next day and was the envy of the office.  I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe!  (oh, except I substituted Tyson's fully cooked southwestern chicken strips as the chicken b/c it was easier to prepare)..

It was my first time making Enchiladas so I wasn't sure how it'd turn out but when i pulled it out of the oven I was very happy because it looked like it was from an actual Mexican restuarant. It didn't just look good, it tasted great too. I'm definitely going to keep this recipe so I can make it often.

Took this recipe with us on a ski trip and made for one of our community dinners - a huge hit with all the hungry people! I used Cherry Republic's Original Cherry Salsa.

My family loved this dish. I read the reviews and I compromised a little on the Marzetti Slaw Dressing. I used a 1/4 cup of thst and then a 1/4 cup of sour cream. PERFECTO! I also baked it all in my cast iron pan. Thanks for the great ideas.

I fixed this on Thursday night and it got awesome reviews. It was so good that we kept picking at the leftovers all night, and my boyfriend even asked me to make it again on Saturday. I used fat-free cheddar cheese and fat-free cream cheese to make it a little healthier for us. It was great!
