Our family INHALED these! My BEST EASY TIPS ...  
  ---1.  Cut unwrapped caramels in half/quarters for easier melting (Kraft caramels in candy aisle also come as "bits" like chocolate chips, same price - great result!) 
  ---2.  When toasting pecans, so do LIGHTLY, as they can scorch.
  ---3.  Best results by starting the caramels melting a little in small saucepan first, then stirring the water and butter into it very well. Watch it ... caramel alone can easily scorch on bottom of pan, so water/butter will help. DON'T omit the water and the butter ... (at least most of the butter) ... it really keeps caramel a little bit softer when it sets up, so it isn't brittle hard and you don't break a molar!!
  ---4.  To get BEST taste and "feel" of "TURTLES" brand candy ... 1) arrange 3 pecan halves together FLAT on the parchment/cookie sheet, ... 2) pour spoonful of melted caramel over them - it will spread a bit - put sheet in refrig to harden a bit, ... 3) melt milk chocolate pieces in a small heavy saucepan on low heat, slowly, so it doesn't scorch either, [meanwhile take candy from refrig to lose some of its chill] ... 4)slide each whole piece of candy into and out of melted chocolate [using two forks to lift and swipe excess off the bottom along edge of pan is easier], and lay back onto sheet to harden ... refrig helps here too.   The process isn't difficult, and it makes them look, taste and "feel" like a real "TURTLE!"

I made this exactly as directed.The pecans should be on the bottom in little clusters or arranged, then the melted caramel added. Also, the chocolate doesn't need to be melted until the caramel is set.

I just made these and they turned out great! I used parchment paper and put them in the freezer before I dipped them in chocolate. I always use parafin wax when I melt chocolate for dipping.

I made these for a family Christmas party and they were a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly, easy to make and delicious. I used semisweet chocolate chips and substituted parchment paper (buttered)for the aluminum foil.

Very, very addicting!  I decided to use heavy cream in place of the water because I assumed it would make the caramel a touch more rich and creamy.  Hold off on melting the chocolate-I did it while the caramel was hardening, which I used parchment for not foil.  I used two pecan halves per candy and instead of drizzling the chocolate, I rolled the hardened pecan-caramel mix in the chocolate so it would be well-coated all around.  I used semi-sweet chips but I think I would prefer milk chocolate.  Will absolutely be making these again!

First of all the caramel candies donâ€™t need to be mixed with anything, just heated a little on the microwave so you can form 1 inch balls. Second you do not mix the pecans and caramel; you need to arrange 5 pieces of pecans in a circle to imitate the legs and head of the turtle (that is why they are called turtles) I do this on a baking pan over waxed paper. After forming the ball you push them in the center of the pecans so you can imitate the shell of the turtle.
After you have all your turtles arranged in the baking pan you need to refrigerate them for at least 10 minutes, in the meantime melt the chocolate. Immediately after taking them out of the refrigerator coat the caramel with the melted chocolate.
I always drizzle them with pecan pieces and white chocolate.

Thanks so much for this outstanding recipe. I read the reviews and made a couple of small changes. I broke the pecan halves in half again, and then toasted for about 10 minutes (watch carefully-ovens vary). I used an 11-oz. bag of caramels. I stuck my toasted pecans in the fridge while I melted the caramels (next time I will cut caramels in half to cut down on melting time). After stirring the pecans into the caramel I used 2 small spoons to drop mixture onto parchment paper; the paper plus the smaller, cooled pecan pieces seemed to stop the mixture from spreading too much. Then I put the pan in the fridge while I melted milk chocolate chips. I used a decorating bag and tip to apply the chocolate over the top of each so I had more control and I like how that looks (I posted a photo). I had some leftover chocolate, but that's okay; I can use it for something else. Wow!  These are dangerously good! The caramel is just right even if stored in the fridge. They're going on my holiday plates, and I'm sure I'll be making these again.  Thanks again.

So good!! The only thing I did different is that my caramels seemed smaller so I used one small bag of them. I also laid the pecans on wax paper first, drizzled the caramel and then the chocolate. Even so- the taste was so much better than store bought!! Not too hard, not too soft. Amazing blend of flavor!! YUM!

We couldn't get the Carmel to melt so we threw out the butter and water and Added about 10 more carmels. We also cooked it like the choclate.

2013:This was the second year I made these for Christmas. I still have the issue of not having the bottoms covered in chocolate. I think this makes them difficult to handle and eat with the gooey caramel on the bottom.
Update 2015: I decided to dip these this time so the bottoms are not so gooey. It was messier and took longer, but I will work to perfect my technique and getting the chocolate thinner. I also want to try them without roasting the pecans. I think it is too easy to over cook them without realizing it and the roasted taste can overpower the flavor. I did not make these last year and my family just kept asking for them, so I decided to make them again. They love them!!

I enjoyed these a lot. The toasted pecans took the flavor over the top. The caramel sauce was tasty, but might benefit from less added liquid, as it was very runny.  Use two forks to dip the candies in chocolate and store in the fridge because they melt easily. I cannot wait to serve these at Christmas.

The butter to caramels ratio is way too high. I wound up adding two more bags of caramels to try  to thicken it, because when I poured the caramel over the pecans, it spread out WAY too far. Even after adding the extra caramels it was too thin. I've made this recipe twice now. I will try making them again using cream in place of the water, and maybe cutting the butter down to 2 T and see how that turns out.

Great starter- add butter and half and half to melting caramels. 
Also, I only used one bag of chips with a little coconut oil added.
