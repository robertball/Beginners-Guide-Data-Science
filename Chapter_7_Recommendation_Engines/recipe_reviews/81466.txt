I first had vegetarian haggis at Henderson's Restaurant in Edinburgh.  This is not the same, but still very good.  I had to add an additional cup of vegetable broth before adding the egg, as it was too dry.  I also added an additional egg which helped it stick together.  I left out the kidney beans and substituted 6 T. ground walnuts for the peanuts and hazelnuts. For mixed spice I used a combination of allspice, mace, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  My vegetarian son gave it a definite thumbs up.  I will definatly makes this again.  Good and healthy and sticks to your ribs.

This is a really good vegetarian option. Served it with the traditional neeps(turnip) and tatties and it was a great success.

Pretty good. I think I'd prefer it as little patties. For the 'mixed spice' I used a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, ginger, coriander, caraway, and cayenne.

This was excellent. My whole family loved it and it's not that much work as you can do the veggies and nuts in the food processor. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 13x9 pan and it made a ton. For the mixed spice, I threw in nutmeg, cinnamon, ground ginger, coriander and oregano. The recipe seemed quite forgiving, so you can be creative with the spicing. I served the haggis with a vegetarian gravy.

Wow, this is delicious!  I'm definitely including this as an option for our next Burns' dinner.

I found I needed to add more water as the oats were cooking.  
I served it with packaged gravy.  Scotch would also be good.  ;-)

I don't know a thing about traditional haggis, but we certainly enjoyed this version!  I used white kidney beans because I had them on hand.  I substituted tahini for the ground peanuts and omitted the egg.  I used a smidgen of cinnamon and allspice in place of the mixed spice.  Even with my substitutions, it was terrific.  We served it as we would meatloaf, so it only served 4. It was a little crumbly without the egg, but we didn't mind a bit; others may want to use it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This stuff is fantastic, I like to add garlic and for mixed spice use savory, caraway and sage.  I usually replace the hazelnuts and peanuts with walnuts.

didn't rate this much.

didn't taste much like haggis to me - I added a fair bit of pepper for a closer taste.

That said it was still good - just not really haggis.

Delicious! It's been a while since I had real haggis, but I think this is a fair approximation, and all with veggies! It's quite easy (especially compared to traditional recipes) - no tracking down strange bits of offal, which are hard/impossible to find in the States. 

I was confused about the "mixed spice" and didn't even think of the pie spices other people have named, so I just ended up using a basil/oregano/sage mix and it was fine. I also subbed pecans for hazelnuts, since I had them on hand.  One tough spot was that the mixture was too dry already when starting in on the 20 minute simmer, so I added water along the way to keep it from burning to the bottom of the pan and drying out. It also didn't set up into a real firm loaf, but served as a sort of hash was just fine. What matters is that its delicious. Cheers!

Tried this and there must be some liquid missing OR instructions to cook the steel cut oats before adding them. One cup of steel cut oats require 3 cups of liquid - so 1/3 cup lentils and 1&1/3 cups of oats couldn't possibly cook in 1 cup of broth. I added 2 more cups of broth. The flavor was good, but not nearly spicy enough for us - I'd add much more cayenne and black pepper too. Otherwise it was a hit.

This was enormously popular at my book discussion club buffet (the book was "The Sunday Philosophy Club" by Alexander McCall Smith - a very Scottish story so haggis seemed appropriate).

Recipe-tinkering notes: 

1. I reduced the quantity of oats to 1 cup -- the additional 1/3 cup seemed excessive.

2. I simplified the mashing of beans and chopping of nuts by processing the kidney beans, peanuts and hazelnuts in a small amount of the broth in a blender, then briefly blending in the rest of the broth and the seasonings before adding it all to the cooked vegetables.

3. I ended up adding nearly twice as much broth as the recipe calls for, as the mixture seemed a bit dry as the steel-cut oats cooked.

4. I added some dabs of (vegan) margarine to the top of the mixture in the pan before baking.

Delicious!

I've had this the last two years for Burns' Supper, and it is pretty good. As long as you stab it and drink your Laphroaig you should be happy.

I tried this using the crock pot. I added 1/2 cup more veggie broth. For the spices I used a mix of gharam masala, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a tiny bit of turmeric. I put veggies in bottom of crock pot with a little coconut oil. I mixed the spices and sprinkled over the veggies. I used fresh thyme insdead of dried and chopped it with a little fresh parsley. Then I mixed the liquids including egg and poured over all. I cooked it on low in crock pot for 3 hours then served with a mushroom, onion gravy. Very good. Thanks for the idea.

I added an additional 2 1/2 cups of broth when I added the oatmeal, as 3 1/2 cups of liquid made more sense with the amount of lentils and oats in the recipe than just the 1 cup listed. I also added 1/2 cup chopped tofu skins (can get these at an Asian market) for an "offal" effect. DELICIOUS!!!

Since I've never had "official" haggis, I'm rating this as a vegetarian meal.  It's delicious!  I used oat groats instead of  cut oats, and I know that next time, I'll have to go with cut oats because they will bind better with the other ingredients.  Taste, flavor and texture wise, this is great!

I used split peas instead of red lentils as I didn't have any in the house and didn't have time to shop! I also placed the onion mushrooms and added garlic into a food processor before adding the rest of the ingredients. The oats was chopped in the blender as I can't find the pin head oats in France and I like if finer than the whole grain that can stay a bit too hard. A couple of tbs of ordinary whisky were also added to the mixture to give it a true Burns night flavour and lots more black pepper! I found it very tasty and will definitely make it again .

Really good for a vegetarian dish. Husband is a meat and potatoe person, and he would even eat this again.  

Did do a couple of changes though, only to add more unami to it.  At first, when it calls for 1 cup of vegetable stock, added 1 cup of red wine.  Then while the lentils and oats were cooking, kept adding vegetable stock so that it wouldn't stick to the pan, ended up adding about another 3 cups.

Good haggis texture.  Put more wet ingredients in to make it less dry which was better.

Was well received by vegetarians and non-veg alike.  Being non-traditional I served it with a poached egg which covered the slice with yolk.  Was both a nice presentation and tasty.

My husband needed a haggis to address so I really wanted this to be extra special.  With luck and a lot of perspiration this came out ok, but the making of it was far from seamless. 
I was concerned about the amount of liquid the recipe asks for but I added the one cup as stated. At the end of the simmer time the lentils were still sort of hard (is this supposed to be the intent ?)  I then added more liquid and attempted to simmer it....aaand it stuck to the bottom. Got it out of the pan-lentils still hard. Then tried to steam it in a bowl in the microwave- lentils still hard...oookay. So I put it in a sauce pan and simmered on low babysitting it for at least 45 minutes. I had to stir it often to keep it from sticking. That seemed to be good enough.  Though it was gloopy.
I  added more spice and herbs, more cayenne and this spice blend called “Ozark” so it didn’t just taste like oatmeal. And I did bake it with the egg until it was firm like a pudding. 
I think I would look elsewhere for next time. Long story short add at least two more cups of water.
Even though my guests liked it, it was stressful trying to fix it ad hoc and put me an hour behind.

**To be fair the stuff tastes great the next day. So very soft & pate-like.
**also I doubled the spice & herbs, sautéed the aromatics in lard (would have used duck fat next time) and used chicken broth+ water. Take the bones of this and modify in your own direction. The 3 stars is just because I thought the directions could have b

This is a good recipe to use and modify for taste and available ingredients. I tried 2 cups of veggie stock and still needed more as it cooked. For the mixed spices I used mostly allspice and a little cinnamon. Next time I'll try doubling the mushrooms, cooking thm in red wine and bumping up the pepper.  I'll also cut back on oats. Maybe more nuts or a crumbled veggie burger to get some more protein. I'm aiming for more of a mush than a loaf.  Too bad Caledonian Kitchen hasn't made their veggie version for a long time

I’m vegetarian, but my husband is not. He has eaten  haggis at several Scottish festivals, and he thinks it’s great. I wanted to make something we could both enjoy. 
I didn’t have any hazelnuts, so I just increased the amount of peanuts.  This recipe is pretty time consuming, but it’s worth making. It’s tasty and wholesome.  I’ve never had haggis, so I can’t personally attest to how authentic it tastes. However, hubby said the spices / overall flavor were very good. A couple of neighbors enjoyed it too.
