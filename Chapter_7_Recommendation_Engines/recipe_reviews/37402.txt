I truly loved this recipe. The only thing I would caution you about would be the medium sized squash. It would be difficult to place 12 halves in a 13x9 inch pan. I used small ones and they just barely fit. Otherwise----it is truly yummy.             Jean Smith Unionville,Ct.

My family really enjoyed squash served this way.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will salt my squash lightly before adding the stuffing to enhance the flavor.

This recipe was very, very scrumptious.  I used bacon bits instead of the bacon and fried my bell pepper and onion in fat free pam.

Delicious flavor!  I drained the excess water from the pulp and then put the pulp through a food processor before I mixed it with the rest of the ingredients since I don't like to eat the seeds whole and the result was a very smooth delicious filling.

We had this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit, even with the kids.  It was very flavorful and didn't taste like vegetables.  It took a lot of effort (like an hour!) to prepare but was worth it for our special meal.  We liked the ability to prepare it ahead of time and stick it in the oven just a few minutes before eating.

These were pretty good.  I didn't have any green onions or bell peppers, so I used yellow onion.  To cut down the cooking time, I diced the raw bacon and cooked it and the onions together.  They looked very pretty!

Very nutritious and delicious veggie side dish! I am trying to watch my fat intake (especially saturated fat) and I made a few changes per the many suggestions from prior reviewers. I steamed (not boiled)3 medium yellow squash that I had previously halved for 6 minutes. I did not use any of the squash pulp--I just removed all the watery seeds and discarded and left the rest of the squash shell intact. Per another reviewer I also used lower fat bacon bits.  Instead of green onions, I used sweet Vidalia onions (they are in season and I live in Georgia). I sauteed the onions and peppers in a small pan coated with Pam and a teaspoon or two of olive oil. Per another reviewer I seasoned the squash before stuffing with ground pepper and garlic powder to boost the flavor. I also used dry Italian bread crumbs and added grated Parmesan cheese (from the green cannister you find near the pasta). I melted 1 tablespoon of Smart Balance spread (instead of using butter) and mixed the sauteed veggies, bread crumbs, grated cheese, and melted spread. I ended up having to add about a teaspoon of olive oil to moisten the stuffing sufficiently. (If fat is a real issue in your diet you could just moisten with either vegetable broth or chicken broth.) After stuffing the prepared squash halves, I added probably 2 tablespoons max of the shredded Parmesan cheese from the refrigerated section. Thanks for the great recipe and all the helpful previous reviews! Will definitely prepare this again.

Delicious the way it is.  I have also prepared stuffed squash omitting the crumbled bacon and substituting browned crumbled sausage, as well as italian bread crumbs for the plain ones.  It is also great that way too.

This is so yummy and the presentation is lovely.  Definitely company worthy!  My DH doesn't eat squash but he would eat the stuffing out of these which contain the squash middles.  Worth trying!

I added this as a side dish (minus the bacon) for Thanksgiving since my mom is the only vegetarian in our very large family.  I did notice the squash became too soft from 10 minutes of boiling and the parmesan sprinkled on top never melted in the oven, but Mom thought they were very good and one of my cousins just raved about these, so I will most likely keep these as a side dish for future Thanksgivings.

This recipe turned out great. I'm a vegetarian so I altered it a little. I left out the bacon and put a little minced garlic and chopped black and green olives in the stuffing. I used parmesan bread crumbs. It turned out awesome. Even my husband liked it and you know how that is.

these were really good and incredibly simple but 10 minutes was too long to boil, my came out way too mushy. I'll boil 5 minutes next time but thanks for the idea! Great change!

I loved the flavor of this recipe, but not the time it takes to make it.  So the second time I made it, I peeled the squash and cut out the seeds, and then diced the meat of the squash and microwaved it for a couple minutes.  I then followed the rest of the recipe, and added a little salt to the squash, mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients, and baked it in a casserole pan for about 15-20 minutes at 350 F.  It was so much easier, but not as fancy looking without serving it in the shells.

Didn't think this recipe was good enough for the amount of time spent on it.  Thought it tasted so so.  Too much squash and not enough other stuff.  Definitely not for those who are looking for a recipe with just a bit of squash or that will make you forget you're eating a vegetable.

This is a great recipe. I've made it twice for family get- togethers and there are never any leftovers. Prep is a little messy, but it is definitely worth it.

Yummy!  I made exactly as per recipe (except cut down to 2 squash) and it's absolutely perfect as is.  We didn't find it needed any additional seasonings, but we're not big salt people.  Definite keeper!

We enjoyed this but thought it needed a little more seasoning for our taste.  Now when I make this I use day old homemade biscuits letting them dry out a bit instead of dry breadcrumbs and add some savory and garlic powder.

I made this because my garden produced so much yellow squash.  Next time I will just give it to the neighbors.  This is messy to make and just isn't that good.
