Pretty good, but next time I will cut out the cloves because it gave it quite a strong licorice after taste.

I used sugar-free pudding and omitted the cloves. My husband loves eggnog and devoured this!

I tried this recipe using the new single serve packets of instant vanilla pudding. I tried one using this recipe, plus rum extract and another using real eggnog in place of milk. I like the real eggnog much better. But in a pinch it is not bad. But no cloves though.

Yummy! I used one package sugar free vanilla pudding and 2 cups nonfat milk/1 cup fat free evaporated milk. I did add 1/2 teaspoon rum extract. I'll tell you, I didn't even miss the sugar and neither did my boys. It's not absolutely OMGeggnog but it did scratch the itch.

I added 1 t. rum extract and left out the cloves, but otherwise made this as directed.  I don't know what happened, but while this tasted good when I was making it, it turned out a weird yellow/brown and had a gross curdled, jelly-like consistency after it set up overnight.

Very easy and delicious. My husband is iffy about eggnog, because he always feels it's too sweet. However, this was just right for him, and the rest of the family loved it as well. (Note: I used cook n' serve pudding because I bought the wrong kind. I followed the rest of the recipe as written, but I followed the cooking directions on the pudding box.)

12.21.15   I wasn’t sure about the “cold milk,” but since it’s the Holidays and I have eggnog in the fridge, I used half low-fat eggnog and half skim milk in the 1.5 oz pkg sugar free pudding which certainly did make the EGGNOG flavor pop.  It was VERY thick, most likely from the thick eggnog consistency, so I added more milk to thin out a little and reach a creamier consistency.  My husband grew up having dessert after dinner.  Although I didn't continue that tradition (we simply don't need to be eating dessert everyday), he appreciates a nice pudding occasionally as a treat.  He was smiling after a couple spoonfuls of this recipe.

I tripled the recipe so I used 4 cups eggnog and 2 cups skim milk.  I mixed in the spices except the cloves, but on top, I crumbled part of a pumpkin muffin on top and then sprinkled nutmeg, cinnamon and ground cloves on top.  Then garnished with cinnamon sticks and served with whipped cream.    I used sugar free pudding mix.  So, the only sugars were natural to the eggnog and milk.  It was raved about!  I might serve with molasses or gingersnap cookies next time, or make a truffle with crumbled cookies, whipped cream and the pudding.  All very good!!!!  Thanks for posting!
