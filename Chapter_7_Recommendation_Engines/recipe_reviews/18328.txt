Julia Child’s recipe for French Potato Salad, which I’m very familiar with and like, is very similar to this recipe so I knew it had good bones.  I knew that even if I had to tweak it a little I’d like it.  Better to be safe than sorry, I thought, so I reduced the vinegar a smidge.  When it came time to serving I really did like it a lot, but I also thought if I had it to do over I’d probably reduce that vinegar even more.  As for Hubs, he said he liked it but left half his serving on his plate.  The way I figure, actions speak louder than words.  He did make the comment, however, that it was a little too tangy for his taste buds. So in hindsight, using just half the vinegar called for would have been just right.  As for the sugar, I left it out and didn’t miss it.  Cut the vinegar a tad and this recipe is elevated to five stars – and may even be better than Julia’s – hers doesn’t have bacon! Note: I used small, long red potatoes (not sure what they’re called) and didn’t bother to peel them.  I sliced them 1/4” thick and they were cooked through but still pleasantly firm at about four minutes.

This ended up being a good dish for us--but I modified it a lot in order for it to work.  I can't imagine bf liking that much vinegar, so I only put in a splash or too, and I cut down the amount of beef broth as well.  Instead of mixing all the liquids separately, I browned garlic instead of onion with the bacon, then added all the liquid and sugar (left out the salt bc bacon is plenty salty on it's own) and reduced it for about ten minutes, then poured over the potatoes.  Although I like how sliced potatoes look, I'm not a fan of them in this dish since they fall apart and aren't easy to eat, so they are probably better diced.  All in all, this has great potential but I completely modified it to make it palatable in our house, so we wouldn't have liked the recipe as is.  thanks for the recipe!

Potatoes were way too vinegary, and the flavors just didn't meld. Also, it made ALOT...ended up throwing out most of it.

I have to agree with the others- it's too much vinegar.  I added some cheese on top and baked the whole thing.  Not bad after that.
