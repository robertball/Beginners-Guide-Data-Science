Easy and so good!  I used hot Italian sausage and didn't add salt since the other ingredients have plenty . Great to freeze for a quick breakfast on the go. Will definitely make again!

This turned into a mess!   I would skip the muffin cups and put in a baking dish, but that defeats the whole point of this recipe.

Great and easy recipe.  Just don't use muffin liners without greasing them first.

These really are impossibly easy to make!  I don't add mushrooms to my recipe and they turn out great.  My 6 year old loves helping fill the muffin pan and loves to eat them even more!  These are becoming a holiday morning tradition in my house and are well received by everyone.  Even leftovers are great,  just heat in the microwave!

I lined the muffin pans with baking cups and they came out so much easier. Just make sure to use paper cups not aluminum ones so you can microwave them in the morning. Very good!

I used refrigerator biscuits, I added potatoes, and I mixed the cheese in with the egg batter. I loved it. they are easy and the recipe can easily be changed to add other breakfast items like hash browns or bacon. A great recipe.

I've already made this recipe twice!  So delicious.  This is the perfect "whatever you have" recipe.  I used country style sausage, sweet red pepper, and onion.  The entire family gobbled them all up.

I was looking for something to eat on the run when we have to leave home extra early in the morning.  This is just what the Dr. ordered!  My husband loves these.  He likes it hot so I added in a sprinkling of cayenne and some garlic powder.

This recipe is so versatile!! I keep the base of Bisquik, egg, milk & cheese (no salt, but plenty of black pepper), and add whatever else I have on hand.. today it was 4 slices of bacon, cooked & crumbled, half of an orange bell pepper, diced, 3 green onions, sliced, and a 4 oz can of hot diced green chile. My bf liked it so much he asked me to make them again tomorrow!

I have made these a couple of times now just changed the recipe a little bit added an extra egg and also used both mozzarella and ceddar and added diced ham along with the sausage.  But even by the recipe they were pretty good.

These are very good. I did not add the salt or the sage & they were still yummy. I will make again & try bell pepper.

I really liked this recipe.  I have made it with the mushrooms and without and turns out great every time.  I have also added chopped peppers on occasion.  I prefer turkey sausage to pork and it is just as delicious.  If you don't have fresh sage use dried but reduce to 1 tsp.
