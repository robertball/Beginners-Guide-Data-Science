I made this for dinner tonight and thought it was pretty tasty. I made a few alterations and will make a few more next time. First I used Splenda with a bit of sugar free maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Instead of the bell peppers, I chopped up some zucchini and added a few shakes of dried red pepper flakes. This mixture reminded me a little bit of Chicken Mole. Next time I am going to cut down on the sauce ingredients by half as this makes things really saucy! I served this over cracked bulgur wheat. I'll make this again. Thanks for the unusual but very tasty recipe.

updated.. still making this recipe.. 12 years later I  decided to take a picture.  I did only make half the sauce and this time I used the peppers on top... I think I'd prefer them cooked, but that just my preference. The chicken also tasted very good cold
