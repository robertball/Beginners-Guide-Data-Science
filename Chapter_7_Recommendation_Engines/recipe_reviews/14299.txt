Was wonderful with fajitas! I made my salad with green onions, and used nonfat yogurt. Adding milk wasn't necessary. Easy to make, & everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a yummy salad to serve with a main Mexican dish.  Here's a tip so your salad doesn't get soggy - quarter the tomatoes and squeeze the seeds/juice out before adding to salad.

I used "Easy Guacamole" and sour cream for the dressing and this recipe turned out very yummy.  Will definitely make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it is quick and easy.  I did not put shredded lettuce on top and served as a dip.  To spice it up, I also added jalepenos and cumin.

THis was a delicious salad.  The guacamole really pulls all the flavors together.  It goes together quickly and easily.  I'll definitely use this again!

Very good and light tasting.  I suggest leaving off the lettuce, or tossing it into the bean mixture right before serving.

My family and I did not think this was a great recipe.  Maybe the guacomale I used was kind of bland.

GREAT! I went a little crazy and just about doubled the avocado/guacamole, and this turned out to be an incredible dish.  I would recomend it to anyone. It is also good with fresh bread.

Awesome! I used whole big tomatoe, whole cucumber and 8oz yogurt(did not want to have left overs). Also I had some open chilli beans in fridge so I put them in. It all worked out perfect. Great combination. Thanks.

I loved the taste of this salad!!!  However, after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days, it was very watery and I had to drain it.  I am not sure if that is caused by the type of guacamole I used or maybe from the tomato and cucumber.

I added a couple tablespoons of taco seasoning and then served it over shredded lettece sprinkled it with some shredded cheese and chopped green onion and served it like a taco salad with baked tortilla chips  on the side....and it was absolutely delicious!  My kids even liked it and normally they hate beans!

I fixed this for lunch on a beautiful spring afternoon. I added corn to give it a little more flavor and color.  I also drained the all of the canned items.  The dressing is fresh and light.  I served this with romaine lettuce and blue chips.  This one was a hit!

I used low fat yogurt, so I didn't need the milk.  It was a tasty Father's Day salad.  Next time, I'll add some herbs for more flavor

Great as a side dish or with chips.  Next time, I may add a little lime juice, because the guacamole was a little brown the second day, but still really good!

This turned out really well. I will make again as it was a super easy evening meal. 
I did add in some seasonings as it seemed just slightly bland, probably since i used fresh avocado instead of guacamole. Some sea salt, white pepper, cumin, and garlic powder.

Thanks for the recipe! Didn't need the milk and nixed the lettuce. I used non-fat yogurt, organic blue corn chips, and made my own guacamole by mixing one avocado, a dash of salt, about a tbsp of lime juice, and about two generous tbsp of chunky salsa. The meal was delicious!

This was a good base for a salad or dip, but where does the flavor come from? No spices or herbs...just kind of bland.

Not too bad to start but it needed a little extra.  Rather than use kidney beans, I opted to use pintos.  I cut back the cucumber to about 1/4 cup and added a pinch of cumin, 1 diced fresh jalapeno (will be two next time), and a 1/4 cup of salsa.
