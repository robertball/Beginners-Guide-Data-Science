Made these for my daughters wedding and put colored icing in the centers - a great cookie everyone loved them.

I loved them... and so did all of my co-workers!  I get requests constantly to make them again.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

6 dozen is way too many cookies. I cut down the recipe. These cookies tasted good. However when you bite into them - they crumble. I recommend trying another Thumbprint recipe. These just don't come out right.

I don't like how these tasted, they were not very sweet at all. I even added chocolate to half of the cookies and still was not happy with them. Will not make again.

My fiance Angus came across this recipe recently, and because he CANT EAT EGG OR DAIRY, he made this vegan, with egg replacer, and margarine. Beat the appropriate amount of water with  the egg replacer to make four eggs and added that when the yolks were called for. Rolled them into balls probably twice as big as suggested, to make large cookies, and then, rather than dip them in egg whites, rolled them in brown sugar instead. He made bigger thumbprints, and he used APPLE JELLY to fill them, and sprinkled them with SKOR TOFFEE BITS, BEFORE putting them in the oven. Took 15 minutes because they're larger. These turned out to be reallllyy incredible cookies! Now me, home on a sick day from work, am keeping myself cheery by making these Angus-tweaked Thumb-print Cookies.

This recipe did not work for me. The dough was way too sticky to roll. It stuck all over my hands and everything else. They took longer than stated to cook. When we picked them up to eat, they just fell apart. They did taste good though. I would not make these again.

Don't know what I did wrong, but this recipe did not work for me at all. The cookies spread out on the baking sheet and were surrounded by melted butter. I baked them for 13 minutes and they were not done. The dough had a great flavor - I substituted almond extract for half the vanilla - so I am really disappointed.

Made this for Christmas baking. My dad and fiance LOVED them. I used almonds instead of walnuts, and was great!

Love this recipe! It does yield A LOT but that’s okay because it freezes well. Some in my family don’t like coconut so I also use pecans and wow are they awesome!

Made these cookies this morning. I had to add 1/2 cup butter and 1 egg yolk to roll dough in addition to base recipe. The original recipe is too flaky and was unable to roll dough into balls without falling apart. Overall good recipe and tasty.

I have made this recipe for years! I use salted real butter at room temp, then refrigerate the dough for at least 15 minutes (long enough to chop nuts and whisk your egg whites) before making the balls. To make them uniform I use my cookie baller to measure the dough, then roll them into balls. I use a round bottom tablespoon measuring spoon to make the depression and put the jam in before baking. They are a little crumbly if you over bake them but if you cook the jam in the cookies they will stack nicely after they cool and not be too sticky.

I made 1/2 batch rolled in coconut, 1/2 in crushed pecans. Both were very good but the nuts were a little better. I can't stop eating these yummy cookies!
