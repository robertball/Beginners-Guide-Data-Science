Super easy no bake pie that tastes very similar to key lime pie.

This definitely was a change in our household... since I usually make something with chocolate!  It was a bit tart, but I suppose that's the way Margaritas are.  I didn't add any of the alcohol and it still set up just fine.  :)

My store did not have a shortbread crust so I made Graham Cracker Crust I.
I used 1 tbsp each tequila, triple sec and lime juice and added the zest of one lime.
I whipped 1 cup of heavy cream for the Cool Whip.
After 8 hours it was still a bit soft, 4 oz of mix may be better than 6 oz..
It was very tasty, similar to key lime pie and the great dessert to end our Mexican themed dinner with.
