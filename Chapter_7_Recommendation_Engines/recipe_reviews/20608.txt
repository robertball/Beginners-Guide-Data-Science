I've made this recipe twice now...so obviously I think it's great.  I rubbed a little vegetable oil over the chicken before sprinkling with the spice rub and let it "marinate" in the refrigerator overnight. Then sprinkled with the worcestershire sauce before baking.  For a nice variation try equal amounts of paprika, cumin, turmeric, garlic and brown sugar. I covered the baking dish with foil and baked about 50 mins covered and 10 minutes uncovered. Used chicken breasts the first time and thighs the next. Both were delicious - moist and flavorful.

This gets 5 stars for easy to fix and the end result was pretty good too.  Extremely moist chicken that smelled wonderful the entire time I was cooking it. Using a meat thermometer to test for doneness, 4 large breasts were easily cooked in about an hour.  I then brushed them with BBQ sauce and let them bake a few minutes more.  This recipe allows you to prepare these without standing over the grill.  An added bonuse for me, was avoiding the blackened and burnt BBQ sauce that happens easily when I am trying to grill chicken and do other meal prep work.

This chicken was soooooooo delicious!  The meat was so tender and juicy--I loved all of the spices on it and there was no fattening marinade involved.  My dinner guests raved about this chicken!

This was excellent.  I will definitely make it again.  The only changes I made was to sprinkle on a little paprika in addition to the other spices.  I also baked it for just over an hour for 3 large chicken breasts and it came out perfectly.  It was so moist, tender, and flavorful I didn't think any other BBQ sauce was necessary.

Very good, just made this tonight. Wanted something easy with items on hand, and this fit the bill. The only changes I made were to reduce the cumin by half and add a about a tablespoon of brown sugar and a 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder. They were done in 45 minutes and oh so juicy.

I used Chipolte Chili Powder instead of the regular chili powder, it was very moist and tasty, though I would recommend to anyone baking chicken, to buy a meat thermometer, the digital ones are easy to use and cook it until it reaches 185, in my oven it was 20 min less time than listed

I left the skin of, which created a juicy meat, but since neither my husband or I actually eat the skin, all the seasonings failed to flavor the meat.  I'll try it again but this time, pull the skin off and flavor directly onto the meat.

Totally loved it, so easy, and tastes like the real outdoor thing.  Two comments -1) sprinkle a bit of oil on the chicken breasts before covering  2) VERY loosely with the foil.

Pretty good. I was intrigued by using liquid smoke. Very cool when you don't have an actual grill. Needs something to add moisture.

I really was not sure if I would like this.  It was wonderful.  I used all the correct ingredients and amounts, just did it slightly different by putting them all in the bowl to make a "paste", added chicken and let it hang out for 2 hours then grilled it.  Turned out great!  On the gas grill it tasted like it was done in a smoker or charcoal grill.  Will definitely do again, possibly on skewers next time!

I made this as written, only using a chicken half rather than 6 pieces of bone-in breast.  I heavily seasoned the outside, and sprinkled some seasonings under the skin, knowing that we would not eat the skin.  Mine did take the 1 1/2 hours took bake.  Nice flavor and easy to make, will use this recipe again.

This was very good and worked well as leftovers worked into other dishes.  It doesn't have the traditional bbq chicken flavor though; you need to add sauce to obtain that.

I should have doubled the sauce (and that was just for two breasts). A little over cooked at 1 hour - will cut back on baking time next go around.

Great recipe!  Made this w/ three boneless chicken breasts.  Cooked for an hour, brushed on bbq sauce the last 25 minutes.  As others said, chicken was very flavorful and moist.  I'd have no shame serving this to anyone.  Definitely a keeper.

My husband loved how the chicken came out.  He said it was his favorite so far.  It was really good and my guest would not stop raving about how good the chicken was.  Defiantly a keeper.

Flavorful and moist.  I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar and used a meat thermomter, because I used boneless breasts.  Quick and easy!

Very easy as the name implies.  Good fallback for when rain prevents barbequeing outside.

Easy dish to make with items easily found in the kitchen.  The chicken had a good flavor and came out very juicy.
