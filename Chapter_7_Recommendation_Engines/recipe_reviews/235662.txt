I made half of this recipe using three very large sweet potatoes (35 oz when they were cooked and peeled,) and it was outstanding! I'm in the process of baking it again right now. It's ridiculously delicious and easy.

This is my go-to Thanksgiving/Christmas recipe, & I have been making it for years. My only changes are to add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and up the cinnamon to a full tbs for personal taste. I also add a ring of marshmallows around the edge during the last 5 minutes of cooking time for my kiddos. Great recipe as written. Highly recommended!

I didn't use sugar in potato part (just the topping) . My family LOVED IT!  They want it to become our new traditional dish for all special occasions.

I whipped the sweet potatoes with a hand mixer, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Everyone said it was great and even asked for the recipe. I will be making it for the Christmas meal as well.

It was a winner. I made exactly as the recipe stated. Everyone enjoyed it. The next time I make it I am going to reduce sugar to 1/2 cup. It was too sweet. That could be because  the canned potato’s were already sweetened. I will definely make again it’s very simple to make as well. I love the fact you can use canned potato’s.

I made this for Thanksgiving and boy was it just what I was looking for! The filling was just the right consistency and the crust was the perfect crisp. I will absolutely keep this forever- now a family favorite! I am a huge foodie and know what good soul food should taste like!

This a winner for me! I usually make casserole with pecan in the mixture of potatoes and top with marshmallows.  The only change I made was add 1/2  cup of whipping cream to potato mixture. Makes the mixture fluffier and a tad sweeter ..  GREAT RECIPE!

The only thing I changed was milk and egg due to lactose intolerance. Overall this is a great recipe and it's really good
