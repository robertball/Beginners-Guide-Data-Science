6.3.19  Admittedly, I’m not the world’s biggest ranch dressing fan.  But we do love potato salad, and I’m always looking for new ways to make it.  I followed the recipe to the letter except for adding a good grind of fresh pepper.  The potato salad has a nice tang, and although  pretty tasty, the dressing was a bit on the runny side, so I might cut back just a bit on the buttermilk the next time.  The recipe instructs you to cut up the potatoes after 10 minutes out of the water, and I’d suggest you be sure to do that.  The warm potatoes will soak up the dressing better than using room temp potatoes.  If you like ranch dressing, I think you’ll like this recipe a lot.  chels420,thanks for sharing.

As is, this potato salad is rather bland, other then the onions and ranch dressing that was pretty much all you could taste unless you hit some bacon.  I would recommend using this as a start, but adding more flavorful ingredients to give it some real flavor.

 I added some red onions for some great onion flavor and some celery.  I think I would add more flavoring as well the next time.

Did not make any changes.  I love spices but this had way too much ranch dressing in it.  If I ever make it again it will be with 1/2 a pkg. of ranch dressing
