Being the submitter of this recipe.  I noticed changes that were made after it was published (not my me)  1) the tomato sauce has been cut way back.  I use about 29 ounces, because I make extra for serving after it is plated, as it gets kind of dry the tortillas suck up the sauce.  2) It is Very important to use Gebhardt chili powder because it is very mild tasting and not as spicy and strong as the generic chili powders you buy at the grocery stores.  If you are using a different chili powder you will need to cut it WAY down.  1/8 cup to 1/4 cup to taste. once the sauce is warmed you can taste it.  3) the water is to be whisked into the chili powder just enough water to make it the same consistency as the sauce so that it mixes in better and doesn't clump.  One last tip I would give is to put the extra sauce in a condiment container such as the squeeze ketchup or mustard bottles.  that way you can squirt it over your plated casserole.

A few steps to get this done. Not quick and easy but so very very good. I followed the recipe as written and served with rice. I think I will leave the lettuce and tomato out and serve  them on the side. I do not like cooked lettuce.

This was really good, I left the lettuce and tomato out and used it to top our servings.

Oh my goodness, this was so good! 
My son is allergic to a whole lot of things including milk, eggs, wheat, soy, rice, oats, beef, pork, and chicken. It's hard to find delicious meals we all can eat, but I made this last night with Daiya non-dairy cheese (a mix of their cheddar and pepper jack flavors) and it was FABULOUS. Even my dad, who is not a fan of most allergy-friendly meals, raved about it.
I left out the lettuce and tomatoes like the other reviewers recommended. We will definitely be making this again.

Way too much chili powder which made this dish somewhat chalky.  Lettuce & tomato served on the side would be much better than soggy lettuce & tomato layered & cooked into the actual dish.

My only suggestions are to use a store bought Mexican enchilada sauce ( I live in an area with great choices for local Hispanic products) to save some time. I also sauteed some onion with the meat, and added extra hot taco seasoning to the mixture, as well as green chiles for flavor. I didn't drain the meat mixture at all. I would recommend using the firmest corn tortillas possible- I used very soft, fresh ones and they disintegrated in the casserole. It still tasted great, but was texturally off a bit. I added chopped tomatoes, lettuce, and onion when serving.

I loved this as did my family.  I also made it for a friend and her family and they requested the recipe. A little time consuming to prepare but it makes a lot and goes a long way!

I needed a recipe that used ground turkey. This was perfect! My family loved it and I will definitely make it again. I did as others suggested and served the lettuce and tomato on top instead of baking those in the casserole. I also used flour burritos instead of corn tortillas because my family prefers them.

Just like everyone is saying: add fresh lettuce and tomatoes on top.  Great recipe.  My husband is a picky eater and he loved it.

Very good. I really shouldn't rate it yet because I didn't have ground turkey and used lean ground beef instead and it was delicious. I did make extra sauce (with just 3 T. of New Mexico Chili) like the author suggested and that made it very juicy and tender. I also served the lettuce and tomatoes on the side instead of cooking them in the casserole. This makes a nice size casserole. Update: ground turkey was used second time and turned out delicious.  Thanks semigourmet

My family and I love this! I used La Tortilla Factory whole grain tortillas which did not get too soft. Lettuce and tomatoe in the casserole tastes great. I did use canned enchilada sauce to save some time. We also topped it with sour cream which gave it a great kick.

Delicious!  The lettuce gave it that extra crunch that we love.  It was a bit too spicy for my toddler even after cutting the chile powder in 1/3, but I would personally have loved it more spicy.  Good stuff.

Incredible! But 20 min was too long. I'll start watching at 10 min next time. (Use 1/8-1/4 c chili powder) TAKE 2: After construction, I poured 1/2 C broth over it. What a difference! Much better consistency. (Note: never use burrito seasoning. Taco only)

This was soooo delicious!!! I only used 1 lb of turkey, and I used Kroger chili powder and Old El Paso hot n spicy packets. Chopped a head of lettuce rather than bagged.
