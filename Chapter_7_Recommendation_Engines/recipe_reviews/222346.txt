wow. fantastic.  I just used the hibiscus as I didnt have lavendar flowers, just foliage.  right around 12 lemons would give you 1 1/2 c.  I subbed in the last 1/2 cup with bottled lemon juice and it worked well.  I put a lemon peel in with the hibiscus water to simmer and cooked only 5 minutes as hibiscus can get bitter quickly.  instead of waiting for cool down, for the last 1c of cold 3c of  the cold water, I subbed in ice and poured hot liquid over ice.  In future  I will triple (at least)  batch and freeze some as ice cubes or in plastic water bottle to use in the pitcher to keep cold. Yum. Yum. Yum. Did I mention yum?

This is very refreshing. The sweet/tart ratio is spot on. The lavender is very strong. I made a second batch with grapefruit instead of lemon and halved the lavender amount. It was excellent. Thank you for the recipe.

I used about 1/4C of fresh lavender from our garden and made the tea with the hibiscus, before adding in 1/4C honey and 1C sugar while it was cooling.  After adding the lemon juice, I just did water to taste as one of my pet peeves is a watery lemonade.  Beautiful color and fragrance, with a wonderful taste.  I will definitely do this again.
