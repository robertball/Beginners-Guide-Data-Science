This rice was totally amazing. I didn`t have chana dal, so I omited it. This dish was great, one of the best rice recipes I have tried. Thanks, Susmita, for your wonderful Indian recipes.

I cheated and used some 'daliya podi' that I had. The podi ingredients scared me because of the chilies.....the kids just would not have eaten it.

The flavors in this were great and we ate every bit! The only thing I had trouble with was the dal. The recipe says to fry them in oil and them grind them. Maybe I didn't get them ground finely enough, but I ended up with hard crunchy bits of the dal in my rice. I did add them in a little earlier to help the mix blend and soften while the tomatoes were cooking, but next time I will add the spice/dal mix immediately so any hard pieces can cook down. I did omit some of the chili spices so my kids would eat it, but I could have eaten them no problem! I substituted some green pepper instead (from my garden) and this was a nice addition. Wonderful aromatic dish and a delightful dinner.
