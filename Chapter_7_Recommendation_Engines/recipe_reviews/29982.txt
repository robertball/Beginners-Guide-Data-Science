This recipe was sooo easy to make and tasted pretty good. I love Havarti so how can you go wrong?

The only thing I did differently was to use butter instead of margarine, and I added some sliced fresh tomato for more flavor. The beansprouts were ok, but I think next time I will use alfalfa sprouts - better taste, and easier to eat. Thanks!

I am really rating the idea, not the recipe as is...In a million years I never would have thought to put coleslaw mix on my grilled cheese!  I figured I would give it a shot and I am SO glad I did!  I liked the creaminess of the cheese, then the crispness of the slaw mix.  I will definitely be adding it to my grilled cheeses from now on!

I am writing this review as I eat the second half of my sandwich. The flavor of havarti and the gourmet dijon mustard I used blended perfectly. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but couldn't wait to try it. I used butter and lots of alfalfa sprouts, instead of margarine, bean sprouts and slaw mix. I also used very thinly sliced havarti and layered cheese, sprouts, cheese between homemade whole wheat bread I made yesterday. It is fantastic!! I just put mung beans in the sprouter and in three days I'll try it following the recipe exactly. Can't wait!

Loved it!!  I am always on the look out for a good grilled cheese sandwich and this one is good.  I used cabbage instead of coleslaw mix, and it turned out so yummy.  Even the kids liked it.

We liked it, haven't tried the kids on it yet. Used butter instead of margarine and alfalfa sprouts instead of bean sprouts. Aside from that it was good. We grilled it panini style with a weighted pan on top of the sandwich. They grilled perfectly. Nice alternative to traditional grilled cheese.

Seemed to be missing meat (maybe pastrami?)...basically a twist on a reuben or rachel...nick though there was too much garlic.

I made it for my mom and two older sisters. It's quick and easy to make, although the taste resembles an egg roll. My mom liked it, and one of my sisters and I thought it was okay. My other sister did not like it at all. I thought it could use some meat, but this would probably be good for a vegetarian.

Intriguing combination, right? And yet, it tastes like something left out a picnic. I used half the coleslaw and it still overwhelmed the sandwich for me. I did not find coleslaw capable of melding with other flavors. I like coleslaw--turns out I just don't like it warm.  I might have just eaten coleslaw and saved the time and not had to eat it warm.

I didn't have Havarti on hand, so I substituted Monterey Jack.  I cut my own coleslaw, added chopped red pepper for flavor, and grilled the vegetables in margarine before adding them to the sandwiches to warm them and help mellow the flavor of the cabbage.  I also added avocado as requested.  This method took longer, but all in all resulted in a very tasty sandwich.  Served with corn on the cob and fruit salad.  I will remember this the next time I want to spice up my grilled cheese.

Wow this was so good. I love the crunch from the slaw mix. I added ham to mine. Also I used Dijon  mustard and added some honey on top of the slaw.
