My husband and I really liked this recipe.  The only thing I did different was use cheddar cheese because I didn't have any jack and we had pancheta, so I cooked up some of that and put in into the mac and cheese.  My husband especially really enjoyed it!

This was very good! Adjusted serving to 8 and followed directions and was a very tasty turn out! I couldn't find Alfredo sauce flavored with bacon, so I bought a package of real bacon bits and added to one jar of alfredo sauce and one jar of four cheese alfredo sauce. I also heated up the sauce and the bacon bits for a few minutes in a sauce pan instead of adding to the penne cold. Added Italian style bread crumbs on top of the cheese before baking, and it came out amazing! Great flavor! Would make again for sure!

Great recipe! I actually cooked and cut up bacon slices into small chunks and threw it in with the pasta! Great end result! Everyone loved this and I'll definitely make it again!

Delicious. Like others, I used bacon bits as I couldn't find the alfredo-bacon combo. I also sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top with the cheese. So good and so easy! I had seconds which I rarely allow myself to do. Yummy!

This was very good. Only thing I added was I cooked and crumbled real bacon and mixed it in. I will definitely make this again. Me an my fianc√© both agreed it would be a regular. It's cheap and incredibly easy.
