Excellent recipe.

I had to admit that I had my doubts about adding mustard to cranberry sauce, but I was pleasantly surprized.
My husband and eldest son both flipped for this recipe, asking for seconds. 

I ended up fishing out the chops, and just dumping the water-cornstarch mixture into the hot cranberry sauce, and cooked it on HIGH for another ten minutes. I also pieced up the chops
and redeposited it back into the sauce
and served it gravy-style over rice.

If I were to make this again, and I 
likely will, due to the reaction of my
family, I will use boneless pork chops.

This chops turned out AMAZING!!! I seasoned them individually before putting them in the crock-pot w/salt, freshly ground black pepper and garlic powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe. They were falling off the bone and had incredible flavor. They didn't really taste like cranberry sauce; they just tasted good! BTW I used apple juice and only cooked for about 6 hours (my slow cooker tends to cook a little faster). They also were great as leftovers two days later. Will DEFINITELY be making this easy and delicious pork chop dinner again, maybe with rice for the extra sauce... Anyway, thanks BUNCHES for posting.

Following others' advice, i omitted the extra sugar and used garlic salt. i eye-balled the mustard, and probably added too little, b/c the chops were good, but lacked "punch." next time i might add more mustard, pepper flakes or soy sauce or w-shire sauce to put a period on the sweet. However the left-overs the next day are DELICIOUS!!!!!! It's unbelievable how the flavors just mature. I think i'm going to wait and serve this the next day from now on.

My mom really enjoyed this but I didn't, and for the same reason:  It tasted almost exactly like barbecue sauce pork chops.   It gets thumbs up for being quick, easy, and fairly nutritious, though.

I cut the calories considerably by using boneless pork chops and ommitting the sugar, cornstarch, juice and water. Instead I used 1/2c applesauce (for three chops - use more for more chops) which effectively eliminated the last step since it naturally sweetens and thickens the sauce while cooking.

This is one meal my family loves, especially my hubby.  I use country style pork ribs and it comes out awesome! I don't bother with making the gravy part at the end, just pour the juices over meat and serve with rice pilaf.  YUMMY!

I used whole berry sauce and a heaping tablespoon of raspberry jam and a touch more mustard.  This was a huge hit with my daughter, and my wife liked it as well, even though she usually doesn't care for cranberry sauce (I didn't tell until after they ate it!) I agree with others that this is best with boneless chops.

The pork was so tender and the sauce was absolutely delicious!  I would definitely make this again.  And again. 

I used a shoulder blade cut of pork for this recipe and seasoned it with salt and pepper before I put it into the crock pot.  I also used whole berry cranberry jelly.  I like the texture of having the whole berries with the sauce at the end.  I probably could use even less sugar next time though.  I would also trim the meat which I didn't have time to do this time.  Then I wouldn't have to cull so much grease at the end.

Delicious--had a taste almost more like ribs. I used boneless pork chops, left out the sugar as others suggested, and used orange juice (it's what I had). Turned out really yummy. Thanks!

While this was quick to throw together this morning before I went to work and all DH had to do was keep an eye on it it seriously lacked in the flavor department. I used a homemade jalapeno cranberry sauce to add extra flavor and even that wasn't enough. The chops were very tender but just didn't pack enough flavor for us. Thanks for the easy recipe tho.

I guess I'll have to try these again with some modifications.  The meat did come out very tender, but I found the sauce to be overwhelmingly sweet.  I guess I'd like something a little more balanced between sweet and savory.  It certainly didn't need sugar in addition to the cranberry sauce and apple juice.  Next time I'll use water to thin it out a little, and maybe some brown gravy mix at the end to balance it out.

I used sugar substitute instead of the sugar and "light" apple juice which reduced the sweetness. Perfect over rice.

We love these chops. I make them just like the recipe says, except I season the chops first with some Emeril's Essence and brown them in oil . I add a little Worcestershire sauce and follow the recipe the rest of the way exactly. I love using the bone-in chops-more flavor. I usually serve them with mashed potatoes and broccoli or green bean casserole. It reminds me of Thanksgiving. This is one of the best pork chop recipes I have ever tried and my 5 year old son also loves them and usually he doesn't like pork chops.

These were okay, but nothing fantastic.  I even seasoned & browned the chops before putting them in the crockpot & added some onions.  I think the sauce needs more seasoning such as cider vinegar & some hot sauce to give it zing.

These chops had a good flavor; however, they weren't as tender as I would have hoped.  I followed the recipe pretty exactly, but they were a little dry.
