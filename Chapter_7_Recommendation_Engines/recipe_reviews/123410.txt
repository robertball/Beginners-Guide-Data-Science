I like to use the shredded hash browns and thaw them. Once they are thawed out I had a little melted butter and smash them in the bottom of my pan. Then I bake them till they are brown to form a crust. I also use either sausage or bacon. Haven't tried ham yet.

This was very good.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage instead of bacon and used more cheese.  The potatoes where a great change from most egg bakes.  I prepared it the night before and baked it in the morning!

I added what we call in New Orleans the Trinity (onion, bell pepper, celery). I added extra cheese, and used ham. I still thought it was a little bland. It needed a LOT more pepper and little more salt. 

Do you know how to really make this recipe a hit? Instead of baking, in a electric skillet, pan fry in a little bit of oil and season to taste. My husband did this and I LOVED the crunchy from the hash browns and the golden color from the cheese.

Was really good, I used frozen shredded hash browns with green pepper and onion.  Did not use meat.  Used some extra seasoning - some salt and pepper.  Then instead of paprika, I sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on the top.  Made it the night before and baked in the morning.  Yum.

I made this for my MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) group and it was voted best dish of the day. I did prep it the night before and added half an onion sauteed in the bacon drippings, extra cheese and some black pepper. I also baked it closer to an hour, but it was cold from the fridge. Will definitely make it again.

I really like this recipe!  I did add my own touches...I made some homemade hash browns which I fried in the bacon greese with some chopped onion and spices.  I made it the night before so I just had to pop it in the oven.  Great taste!

This is a great base recipe.  You can pretty much add or change things to your heart's desire.  I've made it with sausage, ham, bacon and vegetarian style.  I alter cheeses to fit the meats.

this was a pretty good dish.  i added chopped tomatoe, onions and mushrooms for some extra flavor and used boca veggie sausage in place of the regular sausage.  it could have used more cheese and i will add more next time i make it.  to cut down on dishes and clean up time i used the same bowl to mix the eggs/milk as i used to mix the potatoes/veggies.

This was very good and moist and was gobbled up!  I modified it slightly to use a 20oz bag of shredded potatos to which I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and the bacon.  When I whisked my eggs, I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and a generous teaspoon of granulated chicken boullion (I omitted any additional salt) along with 10 oz of skim milk.  After I poured the mixture over the potatos, I dotted with butter and baked for 1 hr.  Then I topped with additional cheese and let it go another 30 minutes.  It was delicious!  Maybe the cream of chicken soup is the added "something" needed that some of the commentors have mentioned.  Anyway, it turned out great!

I have made many egg casseroles and had a difficult time with this as I was tempted to add more ingredients.  I made this recipe true to the original with one exception.  The hashbrowns I used were shredded and 26 ounces.  ( that was all I had on hand) I also used the pre cooked bacon.   It was great.  The simplicity of the recipe added to the goodness.  It was not overwhelmed with to many ingredients.  You can add peppers, mushrooms.....but it is great as is.  Everyone had seconds and good things to say about it.  The simplicity had no-one picking out ingredients they did not like.  Salsa on top can always add a bite at the end when adding the final cheese.

I made this for a brunch and it was a huge hit (with the adults)! I modified it based on other reviews - I added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese and 1 tsp of oregano and basil each to the base, and then 1/2 tsp of pepper to the eggs. People went back for seconds and thirds! I will definitely make this again.

Good basic recipe. I made this for our men's church breakfast, it was a hit. I cut back on the amount of potatoes to about 3/4 of a bag. I increased the eggs to 12 as 8 didn't look like enough. After beating the eggs I added garlic powder, chopped onions, red and green peppers, cheese, and mixed in some sausage with the bacon. Sprinkled the tops with additional cheese. These were made the afternoon before, refrigerated and baked the next morning. Very good.

Several alterations (based on what I had available) made this a perfect, simple breakfast.  I took a previous reviewer's tip and used shredded hash browns and pre-baked them with butter for the crust.  Replaced bacon with cubed ham, sautee'd garlic and onions with rosemary and thyme before adding to the eggs, layered sliced mushrooms on top of the potatoes, and used mozzarella and parmesan whisked into the egg mixture instead of cheddar.  Served with sliced green onions on top.  YUM.  My new favorite!!

This was awesome!  With the one change I made..... I used Obrien potatoes instead of regular hash browns because the peppers and onions give the dish more flavor!

This was very good, but I used shredded hash browns instead.  Next time I think I will season and fry them a bit before baking, though.  I also increased the eggs to 12 and probably used closer to 3 cups of cheese.

Good, but not great, in my opinion.  Seemed to be lacking flavor.  Next time, I will add some seasoning salt, garlic salt.  Thanks!

I made it for a family brunch.  The best part is that I made it ahead of time and when people arrived, I was able to just stick it in the oven and enjoy the company!

I used the pepper and onion hashbrowns. It was terrific! I had to cook mine a little linger (25 min longer) because I used to 20 oz pcks of the hashbrowns. The longer it sits on the counter the better it is!! I loved it.. I served it with biscuits. We are all sitting around ready to take naps! =D My whole family loved it!

Mmmmmmm..........this is comfort food at it's best! My whole family full of picky eaters loved it!! I made one pan with bacon and one with sausage and both were given rave reviews. I did add one extra egg to each batch per other reviews. I also added more seasoning: more pepper, some Lawry's and a healthy dose of my Tastefully simple Garlic Garlic seasoning. This will be perfect for holiday mornings since it can all be prepped ahead and assembled in the morning. Serve it with a side of biscuits or toast and you're all set.

Perfect as written.  My only substitution was using a combination of sausage, bacon and ham to equal the written amount and it turned out great.  Just a tip--DON'T overbake.  Even if you are tempted, take it out of the oven!

I made a lot of changes, but this is a great starter recipe.  First, I used shredded hash browns.  I used 2 lbs of sausage, and 1 1/2 cups of cheese.  I added sauteed trinity & garlic.  I used 1c half&half and 1c milk, and added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese.  I started it all in a hot cast iron skillet, with a layer of the hash browns, then a layer of meat mixed with veg's and cheese, then poured egg/milk mixture over and baked per recipe.  Next I will try it with ham.  :)   See the posted picture.

I made this for work, very easy I would say it could use a little more seasoning. I followed a recipe above and pressed the hashbrowns around the pan like a crust. Yummy. It was a hit !

I added onion powder, pepper, two additional eggs, and doubled the cheese.  Next time I will add Parmesan cheese to give it more of a "zip."  Overall a tasty, easy dish!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It turned out good, but a little bland.  Next time, I will add some spices or something else to liven it up.  Overall, my family liked it, but it's not at the top of the list when making my weekly meal plan.

Good base recipe, but very tasteless without something else added.  Will try green onions, maybe a bit of sour cream next time. Maybe shredded hash browns would also make the potato a bit less overwhelming.

I made this for a brunch and have had requests from my girlfriends for it several times since. So easy to make! I put everything together the night before, cover, and pop it in the oven in the morning.

The only alteration I made was to add more cheese. I found this bland and too heavy on potatoes - you could hardly even tell it had eggs in it.

Super easy to make and very satisfying!  I did some minor alterations; 1. I broiled the hashbrown mixture for 10 minutes before pouring eggs on top (to keep it from getting mushy) 2.  I added oinions and red pepper 3.  For spices I used salt, pepper, garlic powder and a dash of cayenne to help boost the flavor 4.  I used an old sharp cheddar cheese to give more cheesy flavor and used more then asked for. (I put 3/4 cup in with hashbrowns and then topped the entire casserole with a cup of cheese to finish it off)  Cooked for 45 minutes and it was perfect!  I then added the cheese to the top and broiled it for another 3-5 minutes.  The family LOVED this recipe!

Made this for my boyfriend and his friends, all of them raved! It makes a ton and is very hearty. I added a couple handfuls of cheddar cheese to the hash brown mixture in addition to topping it with cheese. I think I'll add more cheese inside next time. I also used turkey breakfast sausage instead of bacon. I couldn't find the plain ground kind, so I just squeezed the meat out of some fresh links. It tasted really good, but I would add more meat (maybe another whole package) next time because the little chunks got kind of lost. Note: This more of a hash brown bake than an egg bake; the hash browns are what make up most of the dish, they aren't just "filler." I liked it that way though, and I'm making it again this weekend!

Loved it! I sometimes make it with mushrooms and tomatoes in it and switch out the meat using, ham, sausage or bacon. Everyone I make it for loves it.

I scaled this downt to 4 servings and omitted the bacon.  I also added some garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper.  It smelled really good when it was cooking and was pretty tasty.  I will probably make this again.

Yum! Changed the recipe slightly. First, I used turkey bacon and country-style hash browns instead of cubed potatoes- 
just a personal preference. Next, I added in about 1/4 cup diced onion for flavor and doubled the cheese. But what really made my recipe is that I added a few spoonfuls of sour cream to the potato mixture. For those who thought this was bland, that should help!

I used the turkey sausage crumbles instead of bacon and while it was good, needed some spicing up. I appreciated not having to refrigerate over night. Good recipe to play around adding spices.

This is really great!  I use about 28oz of frozen shredded hash browns and that's more than enough!  I also use about a cup and a half of cheese mixed in.  Next time I would add a few more eggs but keep the milk the same.    Great base! Thanks!!

I took this to a breakfast party at work and it was totally gone by 10am. What more could you ask for?! I added a 1/4 cup more cheese in the potatoes and on top. I also prepared it the night before and then baked it the morning of - I let it sit out for 45 minutes before baking, but it probably could have sat out for 1 hr or so. I am guessing that the refrigerating was what made the bake time go up to 1 hr, about. But a fantastic item to bring to work for a pot luck!

This was sooooooo good!  I admit- I cooked it a little longer- was scared it would be runny in the middle.  We used sausage- added onion and seasoned as suggested by others.  And by mistake- I bought shredded hashbrowns- I cant say if that helped or hindered- but for now- I wouldn't change a thing.  My parents and in-laws raved about their Christmas breakfast-fantastic recipe.  I do normally like to review recipes based on their original recipe- and not my altered version- so take it as you will.

OK base recipe - very bland prepared as written.  Next time we will use Potatoes O'Brien in stead of reg hash brown (and use slightly less - too "potatoey") and it needs more cheese too...

I made this for a breakfast at work.  It was ok. I might try browning the potatoes first the next time.  Also, if I was making this for just my family I would have added garlic and onions to give it more taste.  My co-workers did like it.

Per recommendation I added an extra egg and  1/4 cup extra milk, so it turned out nice and moist! I would add a little more salt though. Makes for a very hearty breakfast!

Very easy & quite tasty. I brought this to my sister's for Football Sunday Brunch. I used sausage instead of bacon and I had to use more eggs than it called for because of the quantity of hashbrowns. There was a ton leftover, even after 6 people ate. So, I divided this into small containers and froze it. It makes a great on-the-go reheated breakfast!

I halved the recipe and prepared this Christmas Eve and just popped it in the oven on Christmas morning. I adjusted the recipe to include red, green, and orange bell peppers, as well as some green onions and diced yellow onion. My family really enjoyed it. I think this might become a tradition. Certainly was easy!

Very good, served for a brunch and love the flavor.  I used hash browns w/peppers which gave a little more flavor to the dish.

I prepared this without paprika and added green onion, more salt and white pepper. I didn't have enough shredded cheese so I used sliced sandwich cheese. We topped with homemade salsa. Husband said it is good and taste light. Overall, everyone loved it. I will make again but use sausage and maybe 1/2 pound more than a pound. Thanks for the recipe.

I love how simple and tasty this recipe is. I have made it many times and it has turned out perfectly each time. I usually substitute ham for bacon and it works just as well. I usually am left with a lot of left over ham from the holidays. I chop it up and freeze it. Allows for a brunch worthy dish with a minimal amount of effort.

Easy to make and makes a large portion but it was a little on the bland side.  I would make this again but tweak it to add more flavor.

AWESOME base recipe-always a hit at breakfast.  I do make some slight changes.  I use shredded hash browns instead of cubed, I cook a pound of bacon and extra to put on top, I shred a whole block of cheese and extra to put on top, and sometimes I will sub Eggbeaters for a couple of eggs to make it a teensy bit healthier.  Overall, a great go-to recipe.

It was execellent. I made my own changes and it had great flavor. Instead of cheddar cheese, I used pepperjack and I used a little more than the 1 cup it says. I also added some cayenne pepper, black pepper and garlic salt for flavor. I would have to say everyone enjoyed it :)

Absolutely tasteless!  Couldn't even taste the eggs.  It was more like good old Cheese Potatoes.  I am glad I tried it on my family first.  Lots of carbs, fat, and bland.

If you like potato's this is the recipe for you.  Very good, but I used the hashbrowns with the peppers and onion in, and added 2 extra eggs to cover the hashbrowns. Will make again.

I used cut-up breakfast sausage patties and mozzarella cheese, with more cheese on top.  You can use different variations depending on the ingredients.  Would make again.

Wow, this was not good. It was more like bland dry hash browns than a egg dish. There was no real flavor. Way to many hash brown.

This went over great when I had people over for brunch lately.  I used turkey sausage, the hash brown mix with peppers and onions and twice as much cheese.  Tasty.

Really moist and has all you need for breakfast.  I used a pound of sausage instead of the bacon. I also sauteed about 1/2 cup each green pepper and onion together and added to casserole.

This was a great turnout.  I made it with a 20 ounce bag of shredded southwestern style hashbrowns and I used sausage instead of the bacon.  It was very moist with a ton of flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this out Thanksgiving morning so I would be sure it was good to serve to 10 on Christmas day. I added a lot of spices like Old Bay and garlic salt and a little more milk. It came out great! My husband loved it! I may add more sausage next time since it could have used more.

Made recipe as written.  Was plenty moist as written (some complained it was dry), but could have more eggs to balance out potatoes.  Great to freeze in pieces and warm up in microwave.  Added at least 15 minutes to cooking time, but that might be my oven.

I really liked this recipe. Very easy. Instead of meat I added bell pepper and onion. I used reduced fat cheese and split the eggs-4 real and 4 egg beaters with only 1/2c nonfat milk. I am all about the skinny. I will make this again.

This was so GOOD.  I made it for my Mops meeting and everyone loved it.  The whole tray went. The only thing I changed is I added and extra egg 9 instead of 8 and I mixed all of the cheese in with the eggs and hash browns.  I cannot wait to make this for my family.

I made this on Christmas morning for my family.  I added a lot more cheese but thought it was a bit dry.  I think next time I'll add either sour cream or a cream soup. Thanks for the recipe.

We really liked this recipe overall.  It was easier than a lot of the breakfast casserole recipes that I've made in the past.  We have a small family and were having this for a Sunday breakfast so I only made half of the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 casserole for about 40 min.  In the future, I might try adding maybe an extra egg and some sour cream or cottage cheese for extra moisture and maybe some minced onion.

I took it to work for a potluck and everyone asked for the recipe. This is SO EASY! I made it even easier by using Hormel bacon pieces. I greased the baking dish with butter and added some to the top too. Also, added a little cayenne pepper to the eggs and used shredded hash browns.

I baked mine about 50 minutes and it was still a little runny.  I think 5 or 10 minutes more would have been okay. I used more cheese as others suggested.  I think it needs more salt and pepper.  Otherwise it was good.  My husband and kids liked it.  My kids asked for seconds.

Such a great Minnesota dish! I truly don't understand why it isn't popular all around! 

I am a huge fan of cheese, so I doubled the amount. It turned out (and turns out) excellent each and every time I make it. This is a regular for me.

Thanks!

This is delicious & easy! I make it every Christmas Eve for the next morning. I make the bacon in the oven for easier preparation. Place bacon on foil lined cookie sheets. Place in oven at 400 degrees for 18 minutes. DO NOT PREHEAT! Keep an eye on it so the edges don't get too dark. Makes it easier to clean up too!

I made two servings of the hash brown egg bake using two individual gratin dishes and reducing the baking time by ten minutes.  Not only did the dish have an appetizing presentation, it made a hearty breakfast.  This dish definitely needs some jazz though.  We thought it was too bland.

I made this for a cousins family reunion and since we liked sausage & bacon, I put an aluminum foil divider in the pan to please everyone. It worked great. Bacon on one side, sausage on the other. I also prepared it the day before, baking it the following morning. Planning on making it again this weekend.

Unfortunately, this was not a big hit in my house. It was okay, but there were too many potatoes even after using 12 eggs and extra cheese as others suggested.

I like the simplicity of this recipe.  I used veggie bacon and tripled the cheese (which sounds like a lot 1 1/2 cups but it's still not super cheesy).  It's good.  I added a lot of salt and pepper after baking because like others said, it is slightly bland.

Super easy to prepare but next time I won't hold back on the cheese. add more salt and maybe some thyme. Worked great in fridge overnight too.

This was a great STARTER recipe.  I followed the other suggestions and used some sauteed onions and added more s&p and a little garlic powder, as well as white pepper.  I used turkey bacon, at the request of one of my guests and it was OK, but I can't wait to try it with ham and mushrooms!

This went over very well at my post-high-school-reunion brunch.  I browned some onions and veggie bacon in a skillet before adding them to the recipe; I omitted sausage or other meat.  I also added an extra egg and extra milk as some people had suggested.  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but that's what condiments are for.  But it was good plain, too, I thought.  I will make this again.  It's a great base recipe to which you can add all kinds of goodies.

I am a young newly married gal who is learning to cook and this recipe was perfect for me. Very easy to do and was a hit with my husband. We like our food a little spicier so we used hot flavored jimmy dehn sausage and then sprinkled creole seasoning and chili powder on top of the mixture. Yummy!!

I made this for my Bible Study group and it was going faster than the other breakfast bake dishes.  I managed to get a small portion and it was delicious.  I used shredded potatoes instead of the frozen hash browns.  I am anxious to make this again.

Not good - cooked it longer than directions advised and potatoes still were not done.  Put it in the oven for 20 additional minutes and they finally cooked, although the dish is just blah.  Will not make again.

The egg didn't want to cook all the way in the middle.  I ended up taking it out of the oven and I put it in the microwave for a bit.  I can't stand runny eggs, or even the thought of runny eggs  :)

As written--this recipe turns out okay but it really is very bland.  Needs a lot of extras to make it interesting.  My teen daughter said it was pretty blah and didn't eat anymore than 1 piece.

This was really tasty! I made it when my mom friends came over for breakfast. All of the moms had seconds. I followed reviewer suggestions and added the extra egg and 1/4 cup milk, plus more cheese. Also, we are vegetarian so I added Morningstar Farms veggie sausage patties, cut into bite sized pieces. I will make this again!

Recipe was really easy to make, kind of plain. We skipped the bacon, and added more cheese and one extra egg as suggested. I used potatoes o'brien so had peppers and onions in it. Could have used something to add some more flavor, more seasoning or onions or something.
Really simple in a pinch, but not the best I've ever had.

Good flavor, but pretty dry. I would add more eggs next time and maybe more milk? It was easier than most breakfast casseroles, but a bit dry for me.

We made this recipe for our Valentine's brunch at our church. We served around 70 people and got the best comments. Everyone loved it and wanted to know if we were going to make it again for the next brunch our church was going to have!! We added more cheese and made a couple pans with sausage instead if bacon. This is real keeper. Mari16

I made this egg bake the night before and it was wonderful my family loved it.  I did add more cheese.
