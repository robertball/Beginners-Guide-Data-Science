The submitter's description is right on - this IS old fashioned goodness at its comforting best and it IS easy to make as well. The recipe is straightforward, with perfect measurements of ingredients and user friendly directions for even the novice cook. I layered this with sliced bananas in stemmed wine glasses, then topped each parfait with toasted coconut and dried banana chips for garnish. If you are just going to serve the pudding as is, be sure to cover it with plastic wrap, directly on the pudding's surface, to prevent a skin from forming.

Excellent!  I didn't have any cornstarch on hand, so I used 2 tablespoons of flour instead.  It still turned out great!  I filled pre-baked tart shells with it and added fresh strawberries on top.  Yum!

i've never made homemade pudding before so i thought i would try this recipe.  it was soooooooo easy to make and soooooooo yummy!  why has it taken me this long to try it.  i used splenda in place of sugar and all i had was fat-free milk, but it still turned out awesome.  i would imagine it would even be richer with whole milk.  thanks for the great recipe!

perfect!  temper your egg yolks good so you don't get (as one user said) scrambled pudding.  i beat the egg yolks until they look lighter and have a creamier looking texture.  then while vigorously whisking your yolks SLOWLY pour in ladles of the pudding.  whisk the blankety-blank out of it and you should have non-lumpy, non-scramble egg yolks.  i learned that from that guy on the food network.  you know the one with the glasses and hair.  you know who i'm talking about!

Fantastic.  I just made this recipe and it's great.  I doubled it and had about 3-4 custard dishes, so the recipe doesn't make much.  But, boy is it worth it.  My wife makes fun of me as I eat my pudding warm.  When I was younger and growing up in a house with 5 brothers, there was no waiting on cooked pudding to cool otherwise you didn't get any.  So, we got used to eating pudding warm (never a store bought refridgerated pudding in our house).  This recipe takes me back.  Oh my, it's a keeper.

This was pudding was GREAT! Once I tasted that it was good I modified the recipe to make a perfect banana pudding. 
To make the banana pudding: I tripled the recipe, used evaporated milk, added 2 chopped bananas and 15 crumbled Vanilla Wafers. Very yummy!

This is wonderful!! The only change I made was a dinner party for 12. I put a cloud of "on Top" (no melt whipped cream from Gordon Foods)in stemmed glasses, a small amount of crushed cinnamon graham crackers on that, spooned the pudding in and a dollop of whip cream on top. Put a strawberry on the rim of each glass. My guests were in awe!!!! Thank you so much!!

Was looking for a quick and easy substitute for boxed vanilla pudding, and found it. I added a generous dash of cinnamon, mixed dry ingredients first, and stirred constantly until it just reached a boil. (Is quite thick at this stage, just like the boxed stuff.) I also added egg yolks, to enrich not thicken, as the mixture bacame 'hot'. I’d have added them sooner, but I didn’t have a chance. As soon as it reached 'boiling' I pulled from heat and added vanilla and let it cool. I like 'skin', so I don't put plastic wrap on surface of pudding. Some say with these types of puddings that they are 'creamier' if you do the plastic wrap or stirring-as-they-cool  thing, and are 'firmer' if you just let 'em cool until thoroughly 'set', but I've found if they are a bit too firm or 'lumpy', just stirring them before serving smoothes things out quite a bit.  Very good-better than boxed, as you'd expect. Boyfriend liked it and he says he doesn't often like pudding (smile).

Excellent basic vanilla pudding.  Not too sweet, and the egg yolk adds great depth of flavor.  (By the way, using just the yolk reduces the risk of curdling.)  A nice way to add extra flavor is to cook the milk with a cinnamon stick, which gives the flavor without turning the pudding brown.

Awesome custard!  I only wish it made more!  I used mexican vanilla...yummy.  It only makes about a cup of pudding but it's very smooth and tasty.  So much better than the box!  And just the right amount of sweetness.

We loved this.  I increased the servings to 8 in order to use up 4 egg yolks(wanted to make Pavlova).  Our fam of 5 still ate it all in one sitting.  We had it warm with chopped milk chocolate on top.  I used vanilla sugar and added the seeds from one vanilla bean.  It seemed to take a long time to get thick enough, but I put my husband to work stirring.  The whole fam loved this!

I doubled the recipe and good thing I did.  Two of us still polished this off.  This was soooo very easy and soooo very good.  I would suggest using un-salted butter and make sure you use a very good grade of vanilla.  Vanilla is one thing you should spend alittle more money on and buy the good quality product - please please don't ever use the imitation stuff.  The vanilla will really have an impact on the flavor of your pudding.  Will defnitely make this again.  Thanks so much Katie!

Yummy! This vanilla pudding is soo tasty.  It is much better than the boxed mix. Soo melt-in-your-mouth good. I have a few suggestions though..

You MUST add strawberries or some sort of fruit (preferably berries)! It's absolutely a match made in heaven. Yum!

Also, this recipe makes about 1/4 cup so you should definetely double or heck, triple it.

Delicious! Thanks.

First time making pudding from scratch [[besides making banana cream pie]]!! I think it was the wonky stove but it has unattractive brown speckles throughout..though it doesn't smell burnt. It's for a strawberry trifle, so whipped cream will be added, but I def need to work on my pudding-making skills! Maybe chocolate would be easier..Thank you very much for sharing =) it still tastes good

Yum yum!  This recipe is almost exactly the same as the pudding for my banana cream pie.  Couple of tricks from my 50yr old cookbook...  1) Use a whisk, NEVER stop whisking.  You can't whisk too much.  If you don't whisk enough, it'll burn and have brown chunks.  2)  Use a small part of your milk to make a paste with the sugar and cornstarch, and add it after the milk is hot in the pan.  3)  Cornstarch has like double the thickening power as compared to flour.  Adjust if you have to use flour.  4)  When adding the egg yolk, be quick.  Get them right in the pan as soon as you add some hot liquid to them.  Whisk like crazy during egg yolk additions!  5)  And last but not least, don't forget the real vanilla from Costco.  It's dirt cheap and yummilicious from there!  I tripled the batch and 2 adults and 2 children could have eaten lots more.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My previous experiences with vanilla pudding have been gummy, tasteless, or downright unpleasant. This was creamy, delicately sweet, and awesome! I followed the recipe -exactly-, except I cooked and stirred for two minutes instead of one (but that's just because I'm afraid of raw eggs, I'm sure it would have been fine in retrospect). It made enough for three little glasses layered with whipped cream, graham cracker crumbs and bananas, with cinnamon on top. My little brother wolfed this down and declared it delicious. I would double the recipe next time for fuller dessert cups. Kudos on some kickass pudding.

I made this today and it was super quick and creamy.  My secret?  The microwave.  I mixed the milk and dry ingredients in a large glass measuring cup (2 quart) and microwaved on high 4 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes.  Then I added some of the hot mixture to the beaten eggs, and incorporated all back to the large glass  measuring cup for about 1 1/2 to 2 more minutes.  Perfect and no lumps!  I doubled the recipe (who can eat only 2 servings?) but instead of 2 egg yolks, I kept it at one so it wasn't too "custardy".  Delish!

I just made this recipe tonight, and I have to say that I am pleased beyond words.  Creamy, sweet, light and delicious.  I have to be honest, though, and say I used 1/2 T more sugar and I used half n half for the milk.  Delicious !

Great custard flavor but it did not set up well. It bubbled away for what I thought was ample enough time to create a nice thick pudding but it just didn't set up well. Once chilled it was somewhat loose. Would have made a great dessert sauce. Maybe I'll try again and see if I can get it thicker because I like that this makes just enough without leftovers and will then rate again.

This was my first attempt at making home made pudding and the end result was good, but the process was annoying. The instructions weren't written very well and I had to throw out my first batch because it browned too much. You must stir this constantly! Also, the vanilla flavor could have been more pronounced IMO. Next time I will add more or use vanilla bean.

Easy to make, old-fashioned comfort food.  I made this in the microwave because it's so easy to scorch on the stove--no matter the burner temperature or the constant stirring.  You still have to watch it cafefully so it doesn't boil over in the microwave.

When you make this don't think its like Jello pudding ok.  This is more of a custard , due to the egg yolk, its just sweet enough, not a fake sweet.  Also so simple and quick to make, its a keeper for my family.  This recipe was just enough for 2 small dessert bowls.

I love making my own puddings. When I saw this recipe I had to try it. It was wonderful! My family and our guests loved it! It was very creamy, actually almost custardy, and oh so good! One little additional ingredient that I added in seemed to make it even better - cinnamon. I mixed a very small amount into the pudding and then I topped the pudding with a sprinkle of it. It looked wonderful and tasted even better.

Very good, very simple. I've made this several times, and I really like it. It makes a small two servings. It's not too bad when it comes to homemade pudding calorie/fat wise. I've also made it with brown sugar. 3--4 tablespoons brown sugar makes a light butterscotch pudding. I love this recipe.

Pudding just the way it should be. Creamy and not too sweet. I sliced bananas on top of individual serving dishes just before serving. A dollop of whipped cream would have made it "Banana Creme Pie in Dish".

Delicious! My only complaint is the amount of servings. Definitely not for 2. Next time I will triple the ingredients.

I wanted some Bird's custard to put with an apple crisp and whipped this up as a substitute.  It was perfect!

Taste was pretty good, but texture not much so. I think that the directions were not exactly the right way to make pudding... it turned out quite lumpy... The Creamy Vanilla Pudding Recipe in this site had better directions, the pudding turned out completely smooth. So try it out or look for alternatives if you had lump-ness problems.

This turned out like a custard... it was nothing like a smooth creamy pudding that most people are use to. Thee egg ruined it. even as it was setting up it became lumpy. (with proper tempering)

This is delicious and has a great flavour. I use almond milk since I am dairy free and soy doesn't agree with me and omitted the butter.  I added a bit of cinnamon as well.   I will be making this many more times, I will probably add some cooked rice to it next time to make it a rice pudding.

this is the best pudding ever. I love the egg yolks. I reduced the sugar to make room for condensed milk and added way more corn starch while the milk was cold. I put the vanilla extract when I shut off the fire.

I was suprised with the amount of high ratings this recipe had.  I tried to make it three different ways to see if it it would turn out.   I followed the recipe exactly, and it burned on the bottom.   A neighbor told me to try a double boiler as that is  what she uses for puddings to avoid scorching.  It did not scorch, but it also did not thicken that well.   I then doubled the cornstarch and used the double boiler, which was the 3rd time, and it worked.  However, the recipe made very little and also tasted just like the cook top Jello brand.  I was really hoping for something that tasted better than the pudding in a box with all the effort.   My attempt was also to find a thick pudding that would hold up in pies, and this will not work for that purpose either as it is not thick enough. I will keep searching.

Comforting, creamy, perfect. Used half & half rather than milk and half a vanilla bean for the vanilla extract. Have to serve it warm!

TERRIFIC!  This was very easy to make and no changes are needed.  I doubled the recipe as I knew it wouldn't last long.  I used a silicone spatula to stir and keep lumps from forming.  Putting cellophane wrap directly on the pudding keeps it from getting a skin.  This was a terrific pudding and I will be making it again.  Thank you Katie for sharing.

I don't know what I did wrong.  :(  It burnt on the bottom and there are brown chunks all throughout the pudding.  Maybe I didn't mix the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in with the milk enough before heating???

This is a great versatile pudding that you can adapt to any flavor!!  I have tried chocolate, vanilla, banana, and coconut and they all turn out great!!  for the chocolate I melted some chocolate chips and added them after I added the eggs (I still used some vanilla)

I made this for dessert tonight on a cold, rainy March day and it was perfect comfort food served warm.  I used skim milk and it was still yummy and creamy! What a wonderful old fashioned treat!  I would take this over cheesecake any day!

This recipe was so easy and quick for my sweet tooth!!  I doubled the recipe and although it sounds quirky, I added Vanilla Coffee Creamer as it was heating.  It added a bit more sweetness, and a great creaminess.  Thanks for the recipe, and I'm looking forward to making it again!

Delicious!  I was very careful tempering my egg, but apparently not careful enough as I could taste a few little lumps here and there.  Note to self to run through a seive next time just as a precaution. Light, creamy with deep vanilla flavor.  Only change was to drop butter to about half called for.

Delicious! Mine was a little runny, but maybe it's because I didn't chill it in the fridge before using it in a trifle recipe. It's also pretty sweet so I'll reduce the amount of sugar next time. I have no doubt this beats the packaged stuff. Not hard to make at all. I didn't temper the egg york with all the milk mixture. I made 14 servings with 7 cups of milk but only used about 2 cups to temper the yolks. I then slowly poured the tempered yolks back in the hot milk while stirring vigorously. Worked out fine!

I have made pudding since college out of the better homes and garden cookbook that is a million years old.  This is my first time to look at another and this was...... Better!  Not too sweet and very creamy. I used a mix of half and half and skim to try and get some creamy consistency with what I had on hand. Thanks

Delicious and easy!  I tripled the recipe (only doubling salt and vanilla), included a cinnamon stick while cooking, and added 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Delicious!  It tastes so rich and 'old-fashioned' but actually isn't very fattening, mostly milk :)

Just perfect! I love rich foods, so I subbed in heavy whipping cream for the milk, and added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice in with the vanilla--delish!  Tasted like heaven in a bowl.

Great basic pudding!  I quadrupled the recipe and stirred in Ghiradelli chips (about a palm full per recipe), while pudding was hot.  Very Yummy!!  I made a chocolate banana pudding with this that my family just loved! (p.s.  Did need a bit more sugar for my taste.)

Awesome quick (well as quick as homemade pudding gets) recipe! All other recipes I've tried had things in a different order and I liked the convenience of this one. Easily doubles.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and it was perfect! I was wanting a great made-from-scratch stove top vanilla pudding recipe and this is it! 

(I will note that I was a little startled because the volume of milk/sugar/cornstarch increased quite a bit right around the time it thickened and began to bubble. If I hadn't been paying close attention it would have boiled over. After the egg yolks were added the volume settled back down).

Had extra milk to use up so doubled the recipe and it was fabulous.  Chopped up a couple of bananas and poured the pudding over in the desert dishes.  My husband loved it even though this type of pudding dessert is not part of his culture.  I did follow what many of the reviewers have said:  beat the yolks and pour the hot mixture into the yolks whisking the entire time.  This will make a nice, smooth consistency and prevent that scrambled egg goo.  It was so easy and the results so good that  I will make this again!

Really easy, made with ingredients in the pantry and really good! My 7 year old daughter and I had fun making this. Next time I will try sliced bananas layered in it with some homemade whipped topping on top...though this is really good just as it is!

This was really good.  I made a tremendous pot of this to split between three families.  I would maybe add some cocoa powder next time.  I am normally a chocolate pudding gal but this was fabulous.  I have to eat my pudding pipping hot.  I gotta say this wasn't as good the next day as it was once it was made.

I used this pudding in place of the instant boxed pudding that is called for in the Strawberry Delight Dessert Pie (highly recommended!), and it turned out fantastic! Much better than store bought pudding.

This recipe is super easy and really wonderful!  I do make a couple of small changes...I reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 T per cup of milk, instead of 2, as it was a little too sweet for us otherwise.  And I use 1 egg yolk per 2 cups of milk (I make big pots of this!) since I don't want to use up so many eggs, and it is terrific, though I imagine it is great with all of them too.  Thanks, Katie, for a great pudding recipe!

Made this last night, and wow, it was really good. I doubled the recipe and still it was only enough for two average size bowls. There were a few lumps but I chalk that up to my inexperience. Very rich and flavorful. I let it chill in the fridge for a little over an hour, and it probably needed another hour to set completely firm, but was still great. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Not sure what happened but it didn't turn out well for me.  The taste was ok, the texture wasn't.  I doubled the recipe and made a banana pudding, put bananas and vanilla wafers in it and it did not set right.  I liked the taste so I may try it again sometime but there are many others out there just as good and they turned out much better.

I doubled the recipe, but next time I'd use half the amount of salt.  I used salted butter, so that might have something to do with the too salty part.  And, careful when you're cooking on medium high, I burned the bottom of mine because I was in a hurry and wasn't stirring continuously.

I made another vanilla pudding recipe from this site 3 days ago and it was 10 stars compared to this. This was not sweet enough, it formed a film on top and the texture was strange. I'm mad I used my Mexican vanilla on this!!

I added a little extra milk (1/4 cup) to make it less firm for layering with fresh strawberries.  I also follow the recommendations and mixing the dry ingredients with cold milk, no lumps!    My addition is adding 1/2 of a cinnamon stick when I heat up the milk mixture and take it out before I refrigerate the final product.  It doesn't change the look of the product, but adds a nice flavor (it's my boyfriend's favorite dessert).

Right after I made this pudding  it looked and tasted great. I was planning on serving it the next day,however,and chilled it over night. The next day it had turned all liquidy, not a very appetizing pudding consistancy. I gave it four stars regarless, since it was great the first day!

This is a wonderful simple recipe. I used vanilla bean paste instead of extract which gave it a nice appearance and taste, but I doubled the amount because I love vanilla. One batch makes about 3/4 cup. I intend on using this as a filling for a vanilla cake, so I added another tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the pudding a little more. For those who are getting lumps in their pudding, the reason for this is you're not stirring enough or not as often as you should. Stir once or twice every 10 - 20 seconds to make sure you won't get any lumps. If you do end up with lumps, after chilling the pudding, strain it. If your lumps are cooked egg yolk, you didn't properly mix in the yolk.

Delicious! I used flour instead of cornstarch and skim milk and it was still fantastic. Probably my new favourite dessert. Here is a tip though: when you add the egg, STIR FAST! If you don't, it will start to cook and trust me, it's disgusting to deal with.

A tremendously good pudding. I substituted vanilla sugar for the plain sugar, which makes it even better. Thanks, Katie!

I followed the recipe exactly. I tried the pudding while it was still warm. It was all right. It was late, so I let the pudding set over night. This morning it was lumpy and runny. Last night it was thick without any lumps. I have no idea what happened. I also didn't like the taste. It tasted like eggs. I won't be making this recipe again.

I added some rice we had already cooked for dinner.. Used rice milk instead of Dairy, and sprinkeled raisens and cinnamon to the recipe.  I should have made a double batch, because the family LOVED this recipe.

This was my first time making pudding and it turned out great. I had a lot of egg yokes left after making an angel food cake so I made the recipe X6! It made enough for a generous dessert for five tonight and enough left over to fill a Cool Whip container. I'll use that for an after school snack tomorrow.
I also used skim milk and it is delicious and creamy.

Excellent. I have been making homemade pudding since I was kid, and this is a nice one. I did use less butter than it called for, only 1 tsp vs 1 1/2. It was creamy and delicious. I added toasted coconut to make it coconut pudding. This is a keeper.

Yum.  This was wonderful.  Not too sweet and sets up to a nice, creamy consistency.  At first I was worried about it setting up at all, but after the eggs were added it was fin.

I just made this (took advice and tripled recipe) and used it in a banana pudding. It was perfect, and very easy to make. I did have some stick to the bottom, but when the pudding was done I strained it to get the caramel bits out. This recipe is a real keeper!

Easy, tasty and wonderful.  I used a pre-made graham cracker shell.  I did triple the recipe to fill the shell.  I then used the 3 egg whites to make meringue.  Oh so good.

For Dukan Diet version, I use fat-free milk, Splenda (even amounts) in place of sugar, and omit butter entirely. It does take awhile longer to thicken, but it is possible! Delicious vanilla custard flavor.

This is WONDERFUL pudding, but be sure to use a whisk and NEVER STOP WHISKING!  That's how to get the right thickness and no burning.  I had all my ingredients measured out for a triple batch, when I found my milk was prematurely spoiled! Yuck!  So I used a can of evaporated milk and one of sweetened condensed milk, and some water to get enough liquid. Since the triple batch calls for 3 egg yolks, I just used 2 whole eggs instead, and cut out the sugar because of the the sweet milk.  I also used olive oil instead of butter, as I am cutting bad fats out of my diet.  It was DELICIOUS!

The first time I made this (super easy), I made as it is written with the exception that I made it for 12 servings. I used the pudding in a banana puddin' recipe I was making for a graduation party. The pudding was so good I wanted to eat it all myself and skip the party. A couple days late I made it in the two-serving size. Still delicious!!!!! Whether you buy the mix from the store or make it from scratch, you still will have to stand there and stir to keep it from sticking. So, why not make it from scratch? You will know exactly what's in it. You can use the best ingredients you can afford and you get to determine how much sugar etc that's in the results.

Instead of worrying about putting the ingredients directly in a pot on the burner, I simply used a double boiler and it came out beautifully!

I actually used this recipe to make banana cream pie, which tasted great because of this pudding. I did thicken it slightly with flour  and added an extra egg while it was still hot just to make sure the pie wasn't runny. Due to how thick it came out to be I would guess that the recipe is pretty well constructed and that it thickens up really well.

I used this as my pudding recipe for banana pudding.  I didn't have any trouble with lumps in the pudding, but I tempered the egg very slowly and whisked constantly during the entire cook time.  Overall, it took me about 45 minutes to make the pudding, but I was cooking it very slowly so it would not scorch or separate.

Overall, the pudding has a good flavor and it seems thick enough to set.  The only thing that I changed was I used 1/4 c. half and half because I had it in my fridge and needed to use it before it spoiled.  Next time, however, I think I will use some brown sugar along with the white for added "depth."

no matter what you do it turns out lumpy. Even on the picture it's lumpy. I'm an expert at making custards, puddings, and baking in general, but I enjoy trying out  new recipies. Don't waste your ingredients on this one.

I doubled the recipe, since it makes so little, and it took considerably longer than 10 minutes to cook. I wanted to be sure not to scramble the eggs or boil the milk too quickly. Very good flavor, I think, but the texture was off-putting to my 20 something sons, who are used to instant pudding. Layered with walnuts and frozen blueberries, it somewhat masked the pudding's texture. I liked it.  : )

WONDERFUL! I did not have any starch so I used flour (same amount as recipe called for starch) and I wanted to be sure that it was creamy so I used half and half (same amount at the recipe called for milk) an it turned out perfect!! I have tried other recipes and this is, by far, the best I have found yet!

So good and comforting :) I made a graham cracker crust and home made whipped cream. Turned this into little tarts ... it was a perfect dessert!

I made this once and had trouble having it thicken. The next time I scalded the milk FIRST and then added the dry ingredients to the milk. Remember to whisk while doing this so it doesn't get lumpy. It also thickens faster doing it this way. I added the eggs per the recipe. It is not very sweet but I am topping it with some bananas & strawberries which will sweeten it. If you want to make it richer use whole milk or cream.

this just didn't work for me. I did use fat free milk but i've successfully made rice pudding with it with no problem in richness. Its not really that sweet either for my taste.

This dessert is simple and wonderful.  I didn't have any vanilla extract but did have a vanilla bean that I scraped added the vanilla paste and the actual pod to the milk mixture as it was heating...I removed the pods during the cooling period.  The pudding has little felcks of brown in it from the vanilla paste but the flavour it doesn't get anymore authentic than that.  As per other viewers I  topped with toasted coconut and banana chips and you have a  special dessert.  Thank you for sharing Katie

A very easy treat using common ingredients. I used skim milk instead of 2%. Mine turned out runny, but I think that's my fault. I was too impatient in Step 1. I served with cinnamon sugar puff pastry straws and sliced strawberries. Will definitely try again next time with more patience.

Excellent!  I didn't change a thing.  I tripled the recipe, cooked it in the microwave (no scorched pudding for me), and stirred in about 1 1/2 cups cooked rice.  Thanks forthe recipe

This was pretty good, but it needed a little more flavour. I would probably add an additional 1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla next time.

This pudding was incredible easy to make and turned out perfectly!  I used heaping tablespoons of sugar and cut down the butter a little bit, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The only suggestion I would make is to dissolve the corn starch in a tablespoon or so of milk before adding it.  My consistency was a tiny bit gritty.

it was alright, I think I may have cooked it for too long because it came out much thicker then intended. I like thick pudding though...and I added some almond extract, ate it in a parfait.

Needed to use left over egg yolk and this did the trick. This pudding was so good. Now, it's my go-to dessert when I have left over yolks.

This was not sweet enough for me.  Some of my cornstarch/sugar/salt mixture scorched on the bottom of the pan (causing me to have to strain the mixture when it was cooked) so perhaps that took away from the sweetness.  If I make this again I would add another T of sugar and perhaps a bit more vanilla.  Good texture, though.

Nice, simple and quick vanilla pudding recipe.  I cut the sugar down by 30% and it was sweet enough.  I also quadrupled the recipe and that was enough for two skinny adults to have 2 servings each.  It was thin after making but after cooling overnight it thickened nicely.  It had a slight powdery texture but a great taste.

Good flavor with or without adding a cinnamon stick to the first step, not quite what I was looking for though.  The texture is a bit runny, and I believe I didn't add enough of the mixture to the egg yolk for one batch because it had lumps that were likely egg.  I like my pudding thick, and usually use between the pie filling and pudding level of liquid when making them, so should probably look for pie filling or custard recipes.

I made this tonight because I had a sudden sweet tooth, and it was my first attempt to make a home made pudding. This was very easy to make and it tasted great. Some of mine did stick to the bottom of the pan, though. I didn't change anything, but next time I will probably make 6 servings instead of 2.  I added vanilla wafers to mine, next time I'll add bananas or maybe some raspberries.

Yum - this hit the spot! I've made another pudding recipe from this site, but it didn't use eggs. The taste (and *especially* the color) weren't right. This had just the right richness and taste. Very easy, and very good.

This recipe is good as a base to work from, but as it is, it doesn't work. I have made it twice, and each time resulted in a runny pudding without much flavor. Both times I have made it, I've had no cornstarch, so I've used flour. That may or may not have affected the thickness. But the pudding was bland regardless. I recommend doubling the vanilla, and at least tripling the sugar and flour/starch. When I did this the last time I made it, the pudding was a thick, creamy, and lovely, with just the right flavor.

Delicious.  I used skim milk, and flour in lieu of cornstarch and it turned out perfect.  I also only had 3 tbs of butter left, but again not a problem.  I layered it with leftover chocolate cake and semi-sweet chocolate while the pudding was still warm.  Heavenly.

The pudding tasted ok, but the color turned yellow because of the yolk, so it didnt look really good, also remember dont put so much salt.

Doubled the recipe and it came out great.  Used regular "large" eggs but it tasted a little eggy -- not bad, but if making a bigger batch I'd cut back a little bit.    Also made this as a "chocolate" version by grating one full square baker's chocolate for a doubled recipe, and adding just a touch more sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

If you make this and decide you like boxed mix better, you must have done something wrong, because this was DELICIOUS! I skipped the egg yoke and microwaved everything but the vanilla about 4 minutes on high, stirring after 1 minute intervals. So much easier than on the stove!

This is just like I remember making as a child with my big sister!  The butter adds a nice touch, since I use lowfat milk.  I tripled this to make banana pudding, with the layers of vanilla wafers and banana slices, and it was a hit with my hubby!  I might toy with stirring in chocolate chips or creamy peanut butter to make banana pudding next time, but this is just yummy the way it is!

I used the microwave method described by BARBSRX and it was spot on.  I also used only 1 egg yolk and a little less butter, but used a good quality double-strength vanilla.  I don't know how this could taste any better or be any easier to make.  Just make sure to use a whip instead of just stirring.  This was so good I couldn't wait for it to cool before I attacked it.  Okay...now I'm going to go hide my bathroom scales...

I've tried making vanilla pudding before without adding egg, but you just can't beat this recipe.  I did scale this up to 3 servings (1 1/2 cups 2% milk) and added one whole egg instead of just the yolk.  The texture was perfect.   This will be my vanilla pudding recipe from now on when I want a sweet, creamy, treat.

I used this recipe, but tripled it to have enough for my family.  I added some vanilla bean--1/2 before cooking, and 1/2 of it after cooking, as well as only 1 tsp. total of vanilla extract.  It turned out sooooo delicious. The vanilla bean "classed" it up a lot.  I recommend it.

I'm trying to follow recipes exactly as written because I've recently had some bad luck while tinkering...but, now I think I'm going to go back to tinkering, lol. This is WAY richer than the boxed mix...but I don't think that's a good thing. I had to double the recipe for my family of 4...but I SO should not have doubled the egg yolk. It honestly tastes like egg custard. And even though I followed the reviews exactly to temper the eggs by whisking while adding them, there were some weird white pieces...but that might have been cornstarch. Also, why 15 minutes of cooking time afterwards? I'm trying 8-10 next...way too thick. And why butter? Useless. this recipe has plenty of potential...without the butter, with one less egg yolk for a doubled recipe, a TB of vanilla( I used abput 2 ts but still, it was total egg domination), less cooking time. I would make sure the cornstarch are two SCANT tablespoons too. Oh, and I used 2 TB of sugar for my doubled recipe...perfectly sweet enough. I will SO try this again.

I really like the pudding but it took forever to get thick. After about 15 minutes I added another 1 tablespoon cornstarch (I had doubled the recipe) and it still didn't get very thick. It did thicken quite a bit after adding egg yolk and I loved the finished pudding. I doubled the recipe and added hot chocolate mix to part of it to make chocolate pudding (I was out of cocoa powder). That turned out good, too.

ADDED LATER: Fabulous as written!

I had to use "unsweetened almond milk" which I sweeten with a fructose-free sugar and nix the butter for my kids allergies, so I added .5 tbsp cinnamon to help the flavor. The kids should eat it, which is the point, but I don't recommend it with almond milk.

Delicious, and very simple. I added more vanilla, about a teaspoon, for taste. I was going to make a summer dessert when I noticed I didn't have any vanilla pudding, so instead of running to the store I made this, and it worked out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing!  The pudding was smooth and creamy, with the perfect sweetness.  Serve with fresh strawberries and you're sure to have a hit with family or guests!  It is a bit time consuming, but worth the work!  I would recommend altering the recipe to make 8 servings instead of 2.

This is the best pudding recipe I have ever used. I was looking for a custard recipe, and this tasted like custard, except for the fact that it used cornstarch to thicken it. I would definitly make this again. It was also so easy to make. Thanks for such a great recipe. The only problem was there wasn't enough of it!

I wasn't very excited about this.  I doubled the recipe, but it turned out tasting too...buttery.  It wasn't the cool, refreshing pudding I was looking for.  Maybe the recipe should specify to use unsalted butter; I used salted, and that's what might have done it.  I *might* try again, although I'll either use unsalted butter or cut the salt in the recipe by 1/2.  I'll update if I get around to making it.  Texture was perfect though, so I hope I can tweak it to get the flavor I'm looking for.

well, this was a hit & we sure didn't need much.  my hubby critisized me for making it from scratch "again & the last one i made (5 years ago!!)was dreadful"...he loved this one.  i did as someone else mentioned & put a cinnamon stick in when bringing to a boil & this added a nice subtle flavour.  i will make this again but we really dont need to eat very much-- did i already say that!!!

Scrumptious! I ran it through a fine mesh sieve before I served it. However, it makes VERY little and I doubled it. I would quadruple it in order to make a satisfying dessert for 4 people.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it with skim milk, and tripled the recipe. The flavor of the butter, the richness of the eggs, and not overly sweet. A must have for every cook.

Delicious! I tripled the original recipe (to make 6 servings), and I think tripled this makes about as much as a box of pudding mix. I mixed mine with cream cheese and put it into a cream puff shell that I had baked in a 9x13. Very, very good.

Delicious, but you have to be sure you don't scrape up burned pudding from the bottom of the pan.  If that happens, just put the pudding through a strainer.  I made this for my boyfriend who had his wisdom teeth removed and he loved it.  He said it was better than any boxed pudding he had ever tasted.
