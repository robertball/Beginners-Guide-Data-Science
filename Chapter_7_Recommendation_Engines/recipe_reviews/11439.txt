My kids wouldn't help make these they said it looked gross.  They tasted good, nice addition to the platter, I put some red hollies on them and the looked good.

I'm into anything that is essentially chocolate covered raisins!  I melted the chocolate in the microwave, and stirred everything together.  So simple, so yummy!  I was skeptical about using "slivered" almonds, so I substituted chopped walnuts.  They may be called Cow Pies, but the taste is decadent!  I don't think I'd call them cookies, though.  They're definitely candy.

mmmm... Made with 60% cocoa chips instead (so I added 1 T of half n' half to help), and used craisens. Good flavor and proportions.   They're rather dense, obviously, so I might add a bit more half n' half next time, or maybe some almond butter.

Not a bad recipe, BUT I rated it a four because of the distinct taste of shortening.

Easy and delicious.  Subbed craisins for the raisins.  There are several recipes on this site that are exactly like this one ingredient for ingredient.
