I made this for my husband and a friend and they really enjoyed it.  I cooked the chicken with onions in olive oil, added extra milk as well as several spices (garlic salt and powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper).  I sprinkled parmesan cheese and Italian breadcrumbs on top.  Very good!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars rather than 5 simply because, while it is really good as is, I like my doctored-up version better. As with most recipes, I like to give this one my own flare. I use a 7.5 oz. package of macaroni and cheese (Kraft or generic, it doesn't matter)instead of just macaroni. That gives the recipe an even more cheesy taste. Instead of the Cream of Chicken soup and the mushrooms, I use Cream of Mushroom soup. I chop up the onions, but also some celery, and I saute them in a fry pan with about 3 T. butter. Then when they are tender, I add the cooked and cut-up chicken and I fry it all together for a bit, until the chicken has some nice brown to it. Due to the fact that I use the store-bought mac and cheese mix that has the powdered cheese packet, I do add more milk than the recipe calls for (about 1-1/2 cups). At the end of baking, I sprinkle a mixture of butter and saltine cracker crumbs onto the top and bake about another five to ten minutes, until crisp.
Whoever "Walter" is, thanks for this yummy recipe! We need to submit a better photo of it for this site--the current one is not a very appetizing presentation. :-)

This is delicious; great comfort food on a windy, rainy night! I boiled my chicken breasts in water with a large, chopped vidalia onion, lots of chopped celery, a couple of bay leaves, seasoning salt, and some cracked pepper until the chicken fell off the bone. Then I cooked the macaroni in the broth until al dente, drained but did not rinse the macaroni, and stirred it up with what was left of the onion and celery that fell into the strainer with the macaroni. Adding this mixture to the chicken and other ingredients added just the right amount of moisture and made the whole dish extra savory. Next time I think that I'll try a little extra cheese and a cracker topping. My husband and son loved this, as did I. This recipe will be made again and again in this house. Thank you so much for sharing it!

Good recipe.  I used suggestions from other people.  I did add a little extra milk, spices, onion, and added breadcrumbs to top it off.  It would have been very bland without the addition of garlic, seasoned pepper, red pepper flakes, etc.  This was a good change from regular mac and cheese.  I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken.

I'm giving this 5 stars for the idea.  But I did doctor it quite a bit and ended up with mac and cheese my wife, a mac and cheese lover, said was the best ever.  I used a litle cheddar, but also cleaned out my cheese drawer, so added Mexican Queso Fresco, Monteray Jack, Asiago, a brick of mixed English cheddar, and other bits and pieces.  I sweated mushrooms celery and onion, added the soup, a beer, chicken and cheese to make the sauce and tossed it with some whole durum wheat gobetti pasta before baking.  I put some thinly sliced rolls and shredded Parmesan on top to make a crust.  So I changed this recipe a lot, but was so happy with the outcome that I have to give ths 5 stars

I loved that this was a quick and easy meal to put together. My two year old ate it right up! I was skeptical about using cream of chicken soup to make a cheese sauce...and for good reason...the end product didn't taste cheesy enough for me. My suggestion...if you choose to use cream of chicken soup, then use a really sharp cheddar to give it more cheese flavor. Otherwise, if all you have on hand is mild cheddar, then use a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken.

This was good, but maybe a bit dry.  Next time I will add more soup and milk.  I used Campbell's cream of chicken and mushroom and it tasted great.  Tastes a little like tuna casserole but with chicken.  Definitely add spices like salt, pepper, garlic powder and maybe a little hot sauce or red pepper flakes.  Very easy!

This was excellent.  I cooked the chicken with some garlic and onion which was then added to the final pot.  I topped the whole thing with some bread crumbs.

This was quick, easy and my little asked for seconds which is huge!  I prepared as stated, except I cut the milk to 1/4 cup, added 1/2 cup of sour cream and skipped the mushrooms because we're not to fond of them.  I added some garlic powder and diced sauted onions also.  Hubby loved it, this will be added to the family favorites.

I must admit, I wasn't at all certain how this would be, but I made a half a recipe and it was enough for 3 small single-serve casseroles.  Froze them all and had the first one last night.  Holy Tamoley - it was absolutely delicious!  Far exceeded my expectations.  It'd be good even without the chicken, just the macaroni, cheese and mushrooms.  An easy way to make homemade mac & cheese.  Highly recommend.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is super easy and really delicious!  I was surprised at how good it tasted with of the simplicity of the ingredients.  My whole family loved it, especially the kids.  A few changes were made: I omitted the mushrooms and added about one cup of shredded mozzarella I wanted to use up.  I used pre-cooked frozen chicken tenders, defrosted and cut into bite size pieces. This is the perfect meal for a quick, weeknight dinner.

I love this recipe!  When I make it I add a diced green pepper and 2 cups of shredded mozzarella. I combine half of each type of cheese in the dish and then sprinkle the rest on the top before I bake it.

This was a pretty good meal for the few ingredients and prep time involved.  I'm trying desperately to find foods that my picky kids will eat, and this was approved by my 18 month old (not the 3 year old - can never win twice!). I added well-cooked cauliflower before baking - it was mushy enough that it blended in and they never knew it was there. Makes me feel a little better about the nutrition aspect anyway.  Thanks!

Very good base recipe, but it definitely needed some added kick.  I sauteed the chicken a head of time with salt and pepper to taste, cubed it, and refridgerated it.  When I was ready to make the casserole, I sauteed 1 chopped cerely stalk, 1/4 cup diced white onion, and 1 tsp minced garlic (1 clove) in some olive oil (spritzed with a Misto).  When the onions and celery were aldente and the garlic aromatic, I added the chicken to warm it and added 1 1/4 tsp Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Then, in a mixiing bowl, I mixed the cooked pasta, veggies/chicken/seasoning, soup, mushrooms, 1 c milk, 1 c shredded mild cheddar, and 1 c cubed velveeta (in place of the second cup of cheddar to make it creamier and less dry).  I spooned it into a casserole dish and crumbled 2 slices of Pepperidge Farms 100% Whole Grain Whole Wheat bread (for it's nuttiness) on top.  Next, I dolluped 1 tbsp butter spread evenly and drizzled 1/4 milk over the top of the bread to keep it from getting too dry.  Finally, I sprinkled an additional 1/8 c mild cheddar to crust over the top and baked it for 1 hour.  Fantastic!  My hubby raved- and instant classic- but it needed the doctoring.

Not bad! I added a little (1 ts) garlic powder to this and breadcrumbs on top to give it a little more flavor. This was easy and tasty, but next time I'd add a little more garlic and cheese--perhaps adding a different type to mix things up a little.

I tried this last night, and was pretty happy with the results. I didn't have all the exact ingredients on hand so I had to make some substitutions, and I took some tips from previous reviews. Here's what I changed: no milk, so I used half-n-half (75%) and water (25%) as a substitute; no cream of chicken, so I used cream of mushroom and didn't add any extra mushrooms; I boiled the chicken with diced celery, onion, pepper, and adobo; I added a couple slices of american cheese on the top in addition to the chedder mixed in. I cooked the dish for approximately 35 minutes, stirring midway. I really liked the flavor, and will probably add more cheese next time.

My husband and kids loved this.  I cooked chicken breasts on the stove with some diced onion and a little olive oil.  I diced the breasts as they cooked.  I mixed everything else in an other bowl (including a small can of tomato sauce because  so many reviewers said it was too dry) and then I dumped the stuff in the other bowl into the pot I cooked the chicken in and warmed it up pretty good.  Then I only had to bake it for 1/2 an hour, which also made it a lot less dry.  I ended up with a pretty creamy dinner!  Also, I added garlic powder and onion salt.  Yumm.  Thanks for the recipe.

How can something so simple taste so good!  I don't know, but it sure did.  I just added some salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder and that was it!  Great comfort food;)

It was pretty good.  My husband really liked it, he said it could have used a little more cheese.  We don't like mushrooms so we used peas, and that was pretty good too.  It tasted a lot like a pot pie.

Yum! My husband & I had to force ourselves to put down the forks. After reading all the comments, I also added spices (garlic powder, paprika, Old Bay, & Nature's seasoning). I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used the Frenches fried onions. It added crunch & some salty onion flavor. I had leftover rotisserie chicken which made it even easier. I will make this again & again.

I made this a 2nd time & used leftover ham. Yum!

Made this as written.  Not a winner here.  It wasn't bad just not really good.  My husband and boys all have big appetites but there are PLENTY of leftovers.  I'll probablly end up eating some for lunch tomorrow.

Great recipe, though the first time I made it I thought it was a little bland.  So now I cook the chicken with a lot of garlic, seasoned generously with lemon pepper and a few splashes of Tobasco.  I add monterey jack cheese as well as cheddar, and throw in about half a carton of sour cream to make it a little creamier.  The end result is spicy and rich, and very tasty.  I like to give it to my twin toddlers for dinner on days when they've eaten little else.

I used about 1 3/4 cup of macaroni so it would be a little cheesier  :)  Used Gouda cheese and a bit of crushed red pepper & had left over chicken from a roast I made the night before. Omitted the mushrooms since I didn't have them. Baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for about 10 to 15.

I used this recipe as a base and added garlic and a few other herbs to it.  It was a great hit.  I definitely recommend adding some seasonings.  Also, I didn't have cream of chicken, so used cream of celery.  It still worked out great.

We lovingly refer to my hubby as "Mr. Bland" - he likes very, very mild chili and eveything else unspiced. But even he remarked that this recipe had no taste. I love the idea and the ease of preparation but will have to come up with some other ways to add some flavor to this flavorless recipe.

Overall, I would say this is a good recipe.  My husband really liked it.  I followed other reviewers' comments and made the following changes:    I boiled the chicken in garlic, onion, and chili powder.  I used the water from the chicken to boil the noodles.  I used a mixture of sharp and mild cheddar.  I added green onions as I had them on hand. I put an extra cup of cheese on top and also sprinkled some bread crumbs over it.  I used 3/4 cup half & half and 1/2 cup milk.    Like some others, I found the chicken to be somewhat dry.  Other than that, the recipe was good.  Next time I will add some broccoli to the mix.

This recipe was delicious, but I made a few modifications.  I don't like mushrooms, so I left those out, and I also sprinkled bread crumbs over top before baking.  That made it a little crunchier, which was fantastic.  My only complaint was that it wasn't cheesy enough.  Next time, I might add 1/2 cup more cheese and see how that goes.

I thought this was really good and my husband thought it was a great way to use leftover chicken!  (I had made Quick Chick from this site the night before.)  Next time, I think I'll use Cream of Mushroom soup tho, as I'm not really a fan of the chicken version.  I also added about 1TBS of dried, minced onion and a dash or two of garlic powder.  Oh, and a few shakes of bread crumbs to the top for crunch.  It only needed to bake about 35-40m.  Super yummy leftovers, too!

This reciped turned out better than I expected.  It was very creamy and cheesey.  I used some grated onion instead of mushrooms because my boyfriend isn't a big fan, and only baked it for about a half hour.  My boyfriend loved it and the leftovers were even better!

I added a LOT of additional spices to zip this up.  Far too bland for me as written.  So I threw in half a cup of chopped sweet onion, a dash or 3 of tabasco, garlic pepper, a tablespoon of sweet with heat mustard, a sprinkle of cayenne, & plenty of fresh ground black pepper.  Then I topped the casserole with an additional 1/3 of a cup of sharp cheddar and some paprika.  NOW it's a keeper!

This was so easy and very yummy! I did add the suggestions others mentioned. Used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of chicken/mushroom and used mild shredded cheddar cheese. I added chopped onions and chopped celery and sauteed them with olive oil with the canned sliced mushrooms.  Used 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, salt & pepper, and red pepper flakes. Also using 2 handfuls of Panko bread crumbs made a nice touch. My stepkids even liked this! Thank you!

I used a deli chicken, healthy cream of mushroom soup, Kraft crumbles and 1percent milk.  I made a topping of buttered, crushed saltines.  My husband ate half the recipe!  Easy and a real comfort food.

Loved it! I omitted the mushrooms because my son and I don't like them. Added chili pepper, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the chicken while cooking it in olive oil. I added the same spices to the dish when mixing all the ingredients together. It had a Mexican flavor. I think next time I will forgo the milk and spices and try a can of enchilada sauce! Very yummy! (I would've used onions, instead of onion powder, and assorted bell peppers if my son would eat them.)

I doubled the recipe.  I used 3 chicken breasts that filleted first, then marinated in 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 tbps balsamic vinegar, 1 tbps dijon mustard, 3 tsps poultry seasoning, and 1 tsp of Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic.  I put the marinade and chicken fillets into a zippered freezer bag and made sure the chicken was completely coated, then took as much air out of the bag as possible and put in the fridge for two hours.  Then I grilled them on high until they were cooked through.  Instead of just cream of chicken soup, I used one can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  I didn't use the sliced mushrooms because I was cooking for three picky kids.

It was a hit with all of them.  The one who doesn't like mac and cheese liked the mac and cheese part; the one who likes mac and cheese but only the boxed kind wasn't thrilled with it, but she ate it; the one who doesn't like anything had two servings.  I will definitely make this again.  I have a similar recipe that I use and just use uncooked cubed chicken (it cooks when it's baking) and I love it, but the grilled chicken (rather than plain chicken or even plain cooked chicken) really makes a difference.

Excellent!  Made some minor changes.  Only 2 of us so cut it in half.  As suggested by others, used half milk half sour cream.  I combined shredded cheddar and shredded pepperjack cheeses - what a nice combination!  I also added some garlic powder and about 1/4 cup diced onions.  I used already cooked Tyson's Southwest chicken strips and baked for about 25 mins, then put canned fried onion on top.  Cooked for another 10 mins and added a little shredded cheddar on tip.  Delicious!  Halving the recipe was perfect for 2 people.

My only wish is if there was a way for the chicken not to be so dried out.  but, otherwise it was great and easy.  Me, my husband and my 1 year old liked it!

Pretty good recipe! My least favorite part of it was the chicken. I actually undercooked it to begin with given the baking time of the dish and it still came out quite dry. No complaints otherwise.

This was pretty good and easy to make.  I used 2 chicken breasts and this seemed like the right amount.  I browned them in the skillet until golden, a tiny bit undercooked so that they would be less likely to dry out in the oven.  I used 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms, which I sauteed in a little olive oil before adding to the mixture.  Some of the pasta on the top came out kind of crunchy so I think I would add a little cheese the next time for the top.  The chicken did get a little dry, so maybe I would cook it less before I cubed it.

this was really good. I did add some more seasonings as suggested and sauteed onions and mushrooms in olive oil. This wasn't dry at all like iv'e experienced with similar recipes. Even my picky 9 year old had a second helping of this. Its a keeper.

My husband and I cooked this on Christmas for family and friends and it was a hit amoung the young and old! My husband seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, S&P, creole seasoning, and cooked the chicken in a little butter. We then layerd the macaroni, chiken, cream of chicken and cheese.(we forgot the mushrooms, but will use them next time) this recipe was easy and delicious and a crowd pleaser-there were no leftovers and next time will triple the recipe so we can have leftovers!

This was not a hit in our household.  Tired recipe as stated and it did not have a cheesy taste. The condensed chicken soup gave it a salty taste as well.

Excellent. I fixed it up a bit by using the suggestion of boiling chicken in water and adding several spices then, boiling the macaroni in the water. Loved it.

My husband hates when I "mess" with mac & cheese but he really liked this recipe. I added garlic salt and ground red pepper, like other reviews suggested. I accidentally forgot the milk, but it was still awesome!

Followed the instructions exactly and thought it came out wonderful.  It craved my husbands mac and cheese desire and I loved the added mushrooms.  Only comment would be that the chicken can get a bit dry while baking.  Make sure you keep it very juicy before baking.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to put together. I made a few changes to suit our family. Here are the changes that I made: 16oz elbow macaroni, 2 bonless skinless chicken breasts-chopped, 2 c shredded cheddar cheese, 1 26oz can cream of chicken (large can), 1 cup milk, 1/2 medium onin-minced, 4 cloves garlic-minced, 1 package mushrooms-sliced, salt & pepper... topped with parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, and bread crumbs. Cook chicken, mushroms, and onions together in olive oil w/ salt and pepper and then mix everything together in a mixing bowl. Pour mixture into 13x9 pan and top with parmesan, bread crums and red pepper flakes. Yummy. Thanks for the wonderful base recipe walter!

We really liked this dish!  I added 16 oz. of fat free sour cream and used fresh mushrooms (sauteed before adding).  During the final minutes of baking, I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese and french fried onion rings on top.  It was a hit!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe except used 3 cups of cheese. I cooked three boneless chicken breasts in water seasoned with seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Then I cooked my macroni in the same mixture. I added about 1 1/2 cups of half and half to the mixture and it was moist.

I made the recipe according to the directions, and my family and I found it pretty bland.  I doused my serving with hot sauce to add some flavor.

Very easy recipe.  I had to use Cream of Celery soup bc I accidentally opened the wrong can and it tasted just fine. Great way to use up left over chicken.  This casserole tasted even better the next day re heated.

Was looking for a different way for Mac & Cheese for work and this was a great one, everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe except for the mushrooms, used half of a roasted chicken from the night before and added cheese fried onions to the top during the last 10 minuites.  Will be making this one again...

This was a really wonderful recipe, and I know I'll be making it again. The cream soup gives the dish a really mild, traditional-chicken-soup-type flavor - at least the brand that I used. I also made the recipe exactly as stated, measuring out everything - I think the proportions are perfect, I wouldn't change anything. Thanks very much for sharing such a great recipe :)

Thanks for such a great recipe!!!  My 5 year old asked for seconds which NEVER happens.  I made the following changes-used only 1 cup of shredded cheese, added a can of Nacho Cheese Soup, used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half, added green onion, and covered with American Cheese.  I boiled chicken breasts with taco seasoning and garlic salt.  There are lots of ways you can take the basic idea and make several different dishes--definitely a keeper!

I make this recipe all the time, and I love to try new things so that's saying a lot!

I like to sautee the chicken with a little garlic powder to give it a little kick, it really adds flavor to the recipe. I've also tried several different cheeses, but cheddar is best, however if you add a bit of garlic or some onions, white cheeses change up the whole dish (in my opinion).

My family and I thought this was really good! I didn't change anything. I loved the flavor that the cream of chicken soup gave the meal- better than regular mac and cheese.  I bought a rotisserie chicken and used half for this and half for tortilla soup.  This fed 6 for dinner and we still have leftovers for lunch.

Very Good basic recipe.  I add finely minced onion and peas.  This is also very good with bacon, onions, and peas.  I think you could definately use this recipe with a variety of vegetables, chicken, ham, bacon, whatever and it would still turn out good.  Overall, great everyday recipe that the kids will eat.

I thought this was very good.  I gave it 4 stars bc I agree that it was a bit dry, but I will definitely make it again and maybe add more milk or soup.  It was tasty and filling.  If you like macaroni and cheese, you should enjoy this recipe.
