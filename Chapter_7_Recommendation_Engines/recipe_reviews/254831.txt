8.1.16   Well, I liked this dressing but, honestly, don't think it tasted much like Ranch Dressing.   Wanted to be sure I was correct in making this statement, so I had a bottle of Hidden Valley Ranch in the fridge and did a taste test on it.  Regardless, it's still a very nice salad dressing with good flavor, and I LOVE the way it  breaks down nutritionally.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this ranch dressing because both my husband and I love ranch dressing and was looking for a simple clean recipe.  This is definitely a "clean" recipe but it turned out very watery even though I followed the ingredients to a T and the flavor was very bland.  I may try using fat-free sour cream (Trader Joe's) and adding more garlic and onion powder, then see how that turns out.  Will return for an update.
