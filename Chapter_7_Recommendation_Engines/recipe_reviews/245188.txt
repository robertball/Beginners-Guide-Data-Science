This crust was great! Soft and chewy even though it was healthy. I used all ww flour instead of using bread flour and  it still turned out great! This will be my standby easy healthy crust recipe.

We enjoyed this. I will admit that I didn't use this as a traditional pizza crust. I wanted something without toppings so after the dough rose I rolled it out into portion size pieces, brushed the pieces with olive oil and cooked them in a cast iron skillet. Very tasty with a slice of cheese for our lunch.
