My husband loved this easy to make sausage combination. I served the sausage combo over quinoa. Adding onions would make it perfect! There were no left overs. I would say it is a winner.

I thought this was alright. I found the vegetable prep a bit time consuming using 6 peppers alone. I did add a little garlic salt onion powder and black pepper. For the sausage I used a fresh chicken instead of pork brand. I felt like it needed something but wasnt sure what. This was heavy on the green peppers compared to meat if looking for a more vegetable inspired dish.

made this again with chicken and kale sausage from Premio. added roughly chopped onion and just used 1 large pepper. added fresh garlic cloves chopped at same time as tomatoes (heirlooms from our garden!) Was a wonderful variation. I love this recipe easy and adaptable

Easy. Next time I am not going to add the salt because the chicken bouillon made it salty enough
