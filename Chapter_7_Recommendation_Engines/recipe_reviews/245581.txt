Happy Pi(e) Day! I made this pie as it combined two of my favorite things. Apple Pie and Apple Crumble. I followed the recipe as is instead of using a pie crust that I knew. The result...loved the insides of apples and crumbles left the crust on the plate. I found the crust way too heavy with no flakiness to it at all. Next time I would use a rust recipe I know.

It was fairly easy to follow. I didn't have any apple cider vinegar so used white vinegar instead. I also doubled the the filling recipe which worked well for the large family gathering.
