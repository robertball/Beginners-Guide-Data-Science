I love soups like this.  I make a modified version of this by using water and adding 4-6 boulion cubes (half salted w/sea salt, half un).  I let the soup cook its own stock.  Also some tips: use a giant pot and cook this for two + hours to make a thick, hearty stew.  Add some seasoning salt to flavor acordingly.  Finally I make bisquick dumplings and cook them on top.  It is an all evening affair - good for winter nights and a nice movie.  + you will have leftovers for a week.

This was great! I added a whole stick of butter and some extra parsley. Rather than dumping everything together, I started the pot with a little bit of broth, added the onions, and let that cook while I was chopping up other veggies. I went from fresh raw veggies to soft canned ones, adding to the pot as I chopped and increasing the amount of broth (just enough to cover everything and kept it boiling). So by the time I had added everything to the pot, the soup was practically done. I let it all cook for 10 mins to let the flavors combine. Wonderful.

I liked this, and it's so versatile that you can use what ever veggies take your fancy.  I made as is, and will make again with a couple of changes.  I will cook the potatoes first, then when they are half done I will add the rest of the veggies for 10mins so they don't go too mushy.  I would leave out the wax beans, use red bell pepper instead of green, and add more chickpeas and cauliflower.  This is a delicious healthy soup, and will join my rotation :)

Loved it! I threw in everything I had in the fringe and the cupboard. I seasoned as directed and added a little cilantro and about a tsp. fresh ginger ('cause I had them) it was hearty and delicious.

Wow, this was so good! I cut the recipe in half and used two chicken bouillen cubes in 5 cups of water, 1 red potato, 1 cup mushrooms, 1 cup fresh spinach, 1/2 cup onion, 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, 1 cup green beans, 1 cup broccoli, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder. I also added two slices of cooked bacon and a cooked chicken breast. I served this with basil buttered french bread and it was delicious, thank you!

Excellent and simple. Kids helped with prep. Used alot of ingredients up... Didn't have / use broccoli, cauliflower, wax beans, parsnip, navy beans. Did have extra 3 potatoes, 2 banana peppers, yellow bell pepper instead of green, 2 cups of dried shittake mushrooms, 2 cups frozen chickpeas, 2 cups of frozen green peas, 1 lb. fresh green beans.   Used homemade chicken stock.  Very delicious! Salt and pepper to taste.  Very good with biscuits.

Perfect for it's ease and simplicity for a casual Sunday night dinner!  I used a higher end bouillon paste, ensured the presence of a complex protein through beans and a whole grain, threw in whatever vegetables we had in the refrigerator, and got a huge thumbs up!  Combined with grilled cheese sandwiches, it was wonderful comfort food with little effort.

Perfect cold weather soup and a great way to use up veggies you have laying around. I use a different variety each time and have never been disappointed with the results.

I love this versitile soup - anything goes! For my soup - I left out the peas, green beans and wax beans, but used all the other vegetables, and added some chopped pumpkin, and a can of corn. It was so good and filling. I usually make a variety of thick pureed vegetable soups, but i like this one that has discernable pieces and a think tasty broth.

It's a decent way to get rid of leftovers for sure. Not sure what I had on hand blended so well but it was ok.

Loved this soup! I switched a couple of the ingredients, no cauliflower or broccoli - instead used a couple extra potatoes and added some left over chicken. Great tasting soup!

It was a great way to use up the leftover veggies in the house and it was savory. I added a stick of butter and cooked raw and hard veggies to soft and let it boil the whole time. 

Tasted even better the next day and I froze the rest. Thanks for a great veggie option!

This is really good soup. I make it it's different each time with whatever the veggies are available.  One thing is a constant though, I always put in Kale, celery, onion and carrots.  I also use a small piece of smoked pork to add flavor.
