I made one small change by making enchilada sauce otherwise no changes. You definitely do not want to leave out the jalape√±o pepper or the chipotle pepper as it helps balance the cornbread sweetness. I think I would have preferred the cheese be blended into the cornmeal batter instead of sprinkled on top afterwards.

I make this regularly. It's now one of my Go To meals. Everyone loves it & it freezes well, too.
