Very Good! Quick and easy, this is one of those recipes that I had everything on hand.  My children loved them.  I had to add and additional tablespoon of water because the dough seemed too dry.  I was also able to stretch the mixture to fit into a 9x13 pan.  I cut them into squares and topped with vanilla ice cream, drizzeled caramel topping and chocolate syrup on top.  Easy and Yummy!

Confused by this recipe.  If you mix the cake mix as per the instructions on the box and then add the remaining ingredients you basically get a cake with a chocolate bottom.  However, if you do not mix the cake batter and just add the powder to the remaining listed ingredients, it is no where near moist enough to be a batter.  I think there may be a mistake in the amounts of certain ingredients listed.

I looked forward to a quick  easy recipe here, but I was a bit baffled.  The dough was very dry so I added 2 T. water.  You really had to press to get it to fit the pan.  After baking it still looked dry so I sprinkled powdered sugar on it and served it to a bunch of teens.  They ate most of it but I was not impressed.

This was terrible. I was highly confused by the recipe and the end result was just as confusing. Will not make again!

It was so thick I could barely stir it. I added some milk until it mixed better.

I left out the nuts due to a picky eater, & I added an extra egg (had 2 cracked & had to use them! LOL) They came out great - will do again! I also will admit to not quite measuring all liquids,  so there may have been a little extra liquid. Still came out fine. :-)

As written, the end result is a crumbly mess.  With an added Tbsp of water, it's a sticky clump that you can't even spread into a 9 x 13 pan.

The mix was way too dry.  I added 3 extra tablespoons of water.  The mix was very sticky and didn't spread well.  They don't taste good.  Don't make them.
