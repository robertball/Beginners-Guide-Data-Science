Was looking for a pulled pork recipe. Really Thrilled I found this one! The pork practically cooks itself! I just spread the seasoning all over and added a little liquid smoke, 275 degree oven for 6 hrs and the meat was fork tender! About half way through, I poured off most of the broth. When it was done, I added some of the broth back in along with just a touch of bbq sauce, I didn't want to drown it. The slaw on top sends this sammie over the TOP! Thank you Lori, WINNER WINNER OINKY DINNER!!

We were so in the mood for pulled pork.  Decided I would try this recipe because it's made in the oven rather than a slow cooker.  I used a pork loin I had on hand.  Rubbed the spices on the loin, wrapped in a double layer of foil and refrigerated overnight.  Next morning, placed foil wrapped loin onto cookie sheet and baked as per recipe.  Could not believe how delicious, moist and tender it was.  The best pulled pork ever!

I didn't need that much pulled pork, so I cut the recipe in half.  I also didn't want my oven on that long so I cooked it for 6 hours in my crock-pot.   My husband kept saying to me "now don't dry it out".  So after I shredded the pork I put it in the fridge overnight in the orginial juices.  The yummy juices absorbed back into the pork...keeping it moist.   I just rewarmed it (in the crock-pot) the next day & put a little BBQ sauce on it.  Couldn't have been easier.  My husband said it was the BEST pulled pork he has ever had......and that's saying something!

Amazing!!! I made it for my daughters graduation along with chili and pasta salad. There wasn't even a  morsel big enough for a mouse left. I lots of other leftovers, but no pork and I made 2 batches. The only difference I made was that I used a Hellmans Mayo Dijon mix. They make and sell it already mixed. It was delicious. My crew isn't overly fond of the stronger taste of the Dijon mustard alone. This recipe was fantastic!! And my house smelled so dang good. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

I am in the process of making this, and would love to know if the meat should be covered or uncovered?

First of all I used the converter since I was only using 1 lb of meat....silly me forgot to cut the cooking time but it was still perfect even after overcooking it by an hour or so. super easy to make and my husband loved it. 

Followed the recipe exactly and I was not disappointed. Now I know that people love different flavor profiles but I made this for my husband and he says "it was the best ever, even better than steak!" so it's a keeper in my book

I would use an Eastern North Carolina BBQ sauce on any pulled pork sandwich.  There would be no tomato based sauces anywhere near my pulled pork.

So good! I tried cooking it as one reviewer suggested--marinaded in foil all night and then baked in oven.  Was really tender and even got some crispy parts that added extra flavor when shredded.  Will definately make this again!
