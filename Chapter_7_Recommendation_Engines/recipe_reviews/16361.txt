Artichoke and mussels happens to be two of my favorite things. The soup was very tasty but I honestly felt that the flavor overpowered the mussels. I like the soup on it's own better. I think that the artichoke flavor wasn't that complimentary to the mussels.

I am not a huge mussel fan so I switched out for some butter sauted' shrimp instead.....mmmm nice flavor combo.
