This was good for a quick week night meal . I did adjust the amounts a bit and added 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese just to jazz up the jarred sauce a bit.

OK, I give this two stars because of the bottled alfredo sauce. I will NEVER buy that stuff again, its so gross. I definitley recommend making your own with this recipe. It ruined mine - BLECK!

This was wonderful.  I had frozen a chunk of our New Years Ham, just diced it up and made this.  Of course, I forget to buy the frozen peas at the grocery store so I threw in frozen green beans and it was delicious.  Will definitely be making again.  Thanks.

Thanks for sharing this recipe, Angela!  It was excellent.  Even my two kids who are picky eaters gobbled this one up and asked for more!  I substituted broccoli for the peas, used cubed ham and made the alfredo sauce (got the recipe here....Afredo Sauce by Rebecca Swift).  Even my husband, who thinks pasta is a side dish but never the entire meal, loved this recipe.  It is definately a keeper for us.

Really great-tasting, easy-to-make dish.  I had to throw a Christmas party with only 3 hours at my disposal, and this dish was a big hit.  Great twist on "ham" dishes at Christmastime, or anytime. Very rich, full-bodied.  I simmered the alfredo mixture on low heat for 10 minutes while the pasta was boiling, and the flavors mixed prefectly.  Angela, you're a lifesaver!

I have been making this recipe for years (after having something similar at Olive Garden).  Really, really good and EASY.  You could cut down on fat by using the dry alfredo mix and making your own (probably doesn't cut down on sodium though).  Very yummy!

I just wanted something with ingredients on hand, so I used egg noodles instead.  Also, I substituted sugar snap peas for plain ones.  It was great, my family asked when we can have it again. =)

Amazing that five ingredients mixed together can taste so good!  I used dry tortellini instead of fresh (Barilla Three Cheese).  I scaled the recipe to four servings, but it is so rich that it could have easily served six.  Will make again but not very often--not only is it rich tasting, it is rather expensive to make.

This was pretty good and very easy.  For the price of the 5 ingredients it wasn't good enough to make again imo.

Wow... what a great recipe for a quick dinner!  I'm teaching my husband to cook, and I thought this recipe looked like a good canidate for him to try out.  He made this last night... not only was it relatively simply for a cook-in-training, IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!  Great recipe Angela!!

This is great, I used diced ham and made it a main dish. I also added onions and bel peppers and sauteed them down with my ham. This is awesome, I'm eating leftovers as we speak!!!

I really liked this recipe, but my husband didn't enjoy it as much (I think it was too rich for him).  I decided to leave out the peas, and think you could add in almost any vegetable in its place.

Pretty good meal.  I used diced ham cubes, and it turned out pretty good. I also use a garlic parmesan alfredo sauce (Ragu), and it was real tasty. It was just a "heavy" meal, but had good flavor.

This was very rich, but excellent served with a salad, garlic toast, and glass of Merlot! It didn't get 5 stars due to the over-abundance of peas. Next time I will only add about 3/4 cup. I also used Rebecca Swift's Alfredo Sauce recipe instead of the jarred stuff and was very happy with the result. Will make again and try it with Italian sausage next time.

I had forgotten how bad canned alfredo sauce is.  Although everyone choked it down, we threw away the leftovers.  Definately, don't cut corners and make an alfredo sauce from this site!

This was excellent partly because I used a homemade Alfredo sauce. I have yet to find a decent jarred one. It is a simple recipe to make and I'm sure any pasta would be good with this.

I think this recipe has everything you could want in a recipe. Fast, easy, and not to expensive. There is hardly any cleanup after as I used the same pan. My 3 year old is very picky and she asked for a second plate. To please everyone and make things easy on you, this is the recipe to use.

Not much of a recipe using jar Alfredo sauce, and really it is not that hard to make your own if you really want it.  True Italian Alfredo has no cream in it though and is way healthier!

This was so good! I left out the peas and added sauteed onions and green bell peppers. I used one jar of Ragu light alfredo sauce and half of a regular alfredo sauce. We loved it with the ham!

Found this recipe to use up some leftover baked ham and WOW! did my picky family LOVE it! Since my children aren't crazy about peas, I simply cooked them on the side, so husband and I could stir them in on the plate. Also, to cut the cost of jarred Alfredo sauce, I used only 1 jar plus 1/2 a package of prepared dry Alfredo sauce mixed together, was delicious. There are many choices of tortellini,we tried portebella mushroom filled and loved it. Will be making this again. Thanks!

My fiance and his roomates loved this recipe. I thought it was allright, but next time I will make my own alfredo sauce instead of using canned. I also used ham cubes and I will use a different type of ham next time. I will make this again. Thanks!
UPDATE 12/1/13: I decided to try this recipe again since I had leftover Thanksgiving Honeybaked Ham. Instead of using the jarred alfredo, I made my own using the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe by Dawn Carter found on this site. Let me tell you....the recipe is now 5 stars with those two adjustments! Deeeelicious!!! With the alfredo sauce recipe serving 4, I put more ham than what was called for and added 20 oz of tortellini instead of 8. Came out perfect and fed 2 hungry guys, myself, and 3 little children. We all went back for seconds, including the children, so you know it had to be good! Will definitely be making again when we have more leftover ham for the holidays!

I made this and now my wife thinks I am a gourmet chef.  It tasted excellent.  I added green onions and some shrimp.  It was easy to make and the kids wolfed it down.  This is a permanent addition to our recipe box.

This is a great recipe to use my leftover ham.  We love alfredo, so this was a hit with everyone!!

My whole family loved this recipe!  I did make a change and added broccoli instead of peas.  It was wonderful!  Even my picky 6 year old had seconds.  Thanks for a great recipe--it is definitely a keeper!!

I really enjoyed this.  We started with salad, and it was quick and easy to make.  I used about half a pound of cubed ham instead of sliced ham, but it seemed like it turned out really well and made it even quicker.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  Great for a quick dinner on a busy weeknight.  I did feel there was something missing, but since we will definitely be making this again, I'll have to experiment.  Thanks for a really good dinner!
