I've made this soup several times using different recipes and this one by far was the easiest. I doubled it without any issues. I added carrots, celery and potatoes. Also a nice touch was to grate some pickles into the soup at the end for a little crunch and texture.

Oh my! Thank you, thank you, thank you! At 7 months pregnant, this completely satisfied my cliche, pickle, pregnancy craving! Topped it with Tabasco sauce & had it with some warm, crusty garlic toast. I'm living this! I wish I had found it 7 months ago!

I cooked this tonight.  Minor alterations on the recipe.  I cooked leeks with the butter at beginning then added kosher dill pickle.  I did follow prior suggestion of adding red potatoes to put some fullness to the soup.  Leeks made a huge difference.  Family was appreciative and thought it was wonderful.

This was a nice soup.. different from my usual. My only sub was to use evaporated skim milk rather than half and half..

Great base recipe, but I changed a lot and it tasted  just like the soup from the restaurant by my house. I decreased cream to 1/2 cup. I increased pickle juice by 1/4 cup. I added 1 whole diced and potato at the end. I only blended half of the mixture. I used chicken broth instead of water. I added 1/4 tsp ground white pepper.
