I have been growing and making Horseradish for around 5 years now.  I don't care for adding sugar to my recipe.  I think you would like it better without the sugar.

This is VERY similar to what my Grandmother always made and what her mother made and etc..  I think she only used white vinegar and maybe coarse salt and I'm not clear if sugar was ever added.

Grandma would make a large batch once every year by using the fresh horseradish root from her garden.  Of course she grated the rock hard root finely by hand!   

Growing up, this was ALWAYS on the table with dinner, along with the other standard items like sweet and dill pickles.  Pickled beets, watermelon pickles, you name it!  It was on the table.

Some people don't understand the potency of this homemade and pure horseradish and lay it on too thick. 
Most people prefer this over the creamy style once they've tried it and learn how much suits them.  You don't have to like "spicy" or "hot" to enjoy horseradish.

Personally, I've NEVER enjoyed the creamy and diluted versions of horseradish sauces.  I've always been familiar with this since I was a child.

It's so nice and refreshing to use in many of my recipes... rubs for a roasts, adding a hint to different appetizers and dips, and always including it in hearty sandwiches.

I'm so pleased someone included this GREAT and SIMPLE recipe.   Simplicity is often the best.

*** As for how long this safely lasts in the fridge, I believe if the horseradish stayed covered by the vinegar and tightly covered in the refrigerator... and since it's considered "pickling" it should last indefinately.  This is a huge gray area and you should be caref

I wasn't overwhelmed with it when I first tasted it. But three to four days after I made it, it tasted incredible!  Definitely will clear your sinuses.

Wonderful! We grow our own hoseradish and this is a very nice easy recipe. If you want to make small batches as we do, it works fine. Nothing beats the fresh stuff!

Holy Cow!  Hubby has been on the prowl for a good HR recipe (we have a whole lot of "store boughts" that just didn't do & will now be thrown away).  This is great.  However, at the risk of sounding like a moron, the first time I made this, I bought a celery root (it was in the same basket as the HR root) and well, figured it out because: A. it wasn't hot & B. well it smelled like celery.  Needless to say, hubby & I both agree this is great!   Thanks Kim, no more store bought for us!

Outstanding! The hardest part was finding the horseradish root at the grocery store. Do not make too far in advance of the meal, as the horseradish loses power the longer it sits.

I followed the directions to a "T" and my horseradish simply wasn't hot.  I could taste the flavor but I like very hot horseradish and I was disappointed after all that work.  After some addition research, I learned that adding vinegar neutralizes the hot.  I did a second batch but blended the horseradish alone with a little water.  Then, waited 3 minutes for the heat to build (longer than 3 and it will subside) then added the vinegar.  I added it to my bunk batch and it will definitely make your eyes burn!

This recipe is great. I made it again recently and gave a jar to my neighbor. She's Polish and has always liked to have horseradish on hand for sandwiches, so I wondered if this would taste authentic to her. She loved it, and now I'm on order to make some for her every time I put together a batch because it's so much better than store-bought. My husband loves this, too--both for its taste and for its "medicinal" qualities. He tends to get sinus headaches, and a spoonful of this horseradish pretty much cures him! It seems to keep well in the fridge, as long as it's in an air- tight jar. (My neighbor suggested turning the jar upside down every so often to keep the liquid well distributed.) We're still using the horseradish I made at Christmas (2+ months ago), and it has stayed hot and tasty. One last thing: We had guests recently and decided to smoke a ham outdoors. My husband covered the ham with this horseradish, and it was terrific--made the outside a little crunchy but didn't overpower the ham flavor. Even the little kids (ages 2, 5, and 7) loved it. Thanks, BOOK_WORM!

I love this recipe. can someone please tell me why fresh horseradish is yellow and why it has a slight taste of lemon, it's still hot and tastes great but was wondering why it's not white and has the slight lemon taste.

This was my first try with homemade horseradish.  It was very easy to make and I'll make it again.  To try to get the horseradish root to be a finer consistency while still using my food processor, I peeled the root, but left it whole.  Then I shredded the whole root using my food processor.  I then changed the blade in my food processor and processed 2 cups of shredded root along with the other ingredients.  This worked pretty well, but it still wasn't the very fine texture I was hoping for. At first I left the sugar out of the mixture, as suggested by another poster, but the it tasted a little bitter.  Adding the sugar eliminated the bitterness.  My son, who loves horseradish, also loved this recipe.

This was so GOOD! We were trying to be healthier this year at Thanksgiving so decided to make our own horseradish! Such an easy recipe....we mixed it with mayo for pork loin sandwiches and had to put a warning on it for the kidlets! It's potent but delishious!

YES! Finally! The same horseradish that the restaurants have! Don't plan on it tasting correctly for 2 days. Then. WOW!  Very good. If you heat it in a jar in boiling water for 10 minutes it will keep longer.

I acutally took the time to join Allrecipes so that I could rate this recipe...  PERFECT!  Simple with  fantastic flavour/heat.  Just know that it takes at least an hour or two before the heat kicks in.  Then it *really* kicks in :-)

Very easy!  Despite the fact that we used a blender instead of a food processor (long story...)  Anyway, used store-bought all my life but fresh is just sooo much better.  Definitely recommend a food processor!  But a blender will work in a pinch (took about 7 minutes for one batch).  Does anyone know how long this will keep in the refrigerator?  Planning on growing my own from now on.

I used cider vinegar for my recipe. No sugar. 
Also, I think, if you wait a while to add the vinegar after you've processed the horseradish, I'm told it would come out hotter! Hard to tell! About the sugar?
You can always add it to the recipe if there's none in the fresh horseradish.

Well.  First timer.  Always had store bought horse radish all different brands including advertised very HOT.   So washed, scraped, chopped the HR root straight from the garden and it wasn't making me have any reaction.   Sooooo I figured this was not going to be very hot.  I was going to put it in the vita mixer with the cover on so I decided to do it in the house.  Still not causing any reaction and no unbearable fumes.  Well I am thinking this is going to be bland.   Time for the taste test.  To be on the safe side I tried 1/4 tsp. of the horse radish.   Dynamite I think it was going to blow my socks off and stop my heart.  This is some potent stuff.  BEWARE.  Will let it weaken a little in the frig.   It does not compare to store bought.  It exceeds any store bought  horse radish I ever had.

I make horseradish all the time, however I've never used sugar...I mixed part vinegar with part of Carnation milk.  I grind the root in my food processor until it's ultra thin, becareful when opening the lid, it's very hot...my kids said if mom isn't crying, the root isn't hot.  Then I add the milk mixture slowly until I get the consistent I'm looking for. Don't toss  all the milk mixture into the grind root...it makes it too waterly, you want it so you can make cocktail sauce and be able to place it on roast beef....

Great!  Put some in a jelly jar to use in the next month.  Put the rest in jelly jars and freeze until needed. That way you'll always have fresh available.

I just made this to go with PJ's Sweet Potato Mash. In an effort to know my ingredients, ready-made horseradish at the store had so many extras in it, I couldn't buy them.  This is an easy, quick recipe!  I used my little Cuisinart to grate the horseradish. It only has two modes, grate and chop, so the root never got to a fine consistency.  I may try the blender next time. The reason you're told to "keep your face away from the container" is that the fumes will slightly burn and make your eyes water. Think of wasabi!  Great recipe.

Just a question.  I have white radish( very hot) growing in my garden. How does this differ from the "root". Are they interchangable in preparing horseradish

Simple and great.  I had a huge horseradish root, so I quadrupled the recipe, expecting to give most of it away, but we ate it all up in no time.

It's worth 5 stars even though I left out the sugar and waited 3 minutes before adding the vinegar!  It is better than any prepared horseradish I've tried!

My husband likes a coarser texture for his horseradish.  We simply grated the root on the small hole side of a cowbell then mixed all in bowl. No blending or processing needed.  Also, we did NOT add any sugar.  Very very good!

Used this recipe as a basis to a horseradish sauce recipe on this board that I also rated on.  Instead of regular vinegar, I used the equivalent of white wine vinegar.  Very good.  The texture was still a little cruncy but I'm sure if I gave it time to sit overnight it would soften or perhaps I can use another food processor (ohhhh...hunny! LOL).  Very good otherwise :0)  Thanks for sharing!

A big WOW! If you love horseradish this is fantastic! So much better than the grocery store kind. Love it mixed with ketchup and a little lemon for dipping shrimp. Also great mixed with mayo for a delicious sandwich spread. Thank you Kim!

turned out great and I heated it with a little extra vinegar and then jarred/ canned it up. also made some horseradish cream sauce too from this fresh stuff. equal 1/4 cups parts horseradish and sour cream, then 2 tsp of brown mustard, diced chives, splash of rice wine vinegar, salt and pepper. Let it sit in the fridge one day and Love the cream sauce on steaks.

Too good and too easy!  :).  I love that you can make just as much as you need, so none goes to waste.  I used just the horseradish and vinegar but no sugar.  I may try using the sugar in my next batch.  I love making condiments from scratch because you can add whatever you want to them.  I'll probably add some garlic and/or onion in one of my batches.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just made some. It is HOT!! We used a meat grinder. The first one was a course grind then went to a fine grinder. We saved the juice from grinding and included it with the liquid measure. We also used kosher salt instead of iodized salt. Turned out GREAT!

Simple, easy..... never going back to store-bought!  I prefer not to add sugar.  I do grind it, wait a few minutes, wipe the tears from my eyes, then add the vinegar!

If you like it hot, wait 1 or 2 minutes to add the vinegar after it is processed. If you like it on the mild side, read no further. I've been growing and making horseradish from root for over 10 years. I do one torturous batch of about 40 pint jars and immediately freeze them. I like it hot and adding vinegar before grinding the root doesn't do it for me. Since the vinegar stabilizes the level of hotness of the ground horseradish, I wait about 3 minutes after its ground to blend in the vinegar before bottling. I don't use or see a need for sugar, and salt is optional. By freezing it it retains some of its pungency, at least much more so than if it's stored in the refrigerator. I give a lot away and people seem to enjoy it.

So true are the instructions to process and process and process. 
I did not use any sugar and we are VERY happy with the results.  I’m sure the root itself has more impact in the taste and textures than the recipe ingredients but this is our second year with this plant we believe it is perfect!

Just awesome!  Made it exactly according to the recipe, let it sit in the frig for a couple days and it rivals the best restaurant or store bought variety’s.

This was absolutely awesome. The first time I ever made horseradish. I didn't change a thing. So easy to make. This will now be the only horseradish in my kitchen.

Just made this tonight. I followed the recipe exactly and while it's very tasty, it's really not hot at all.   Still, the taste is wonderful and it costs much less than the store bought jarred variety.

This is great! And WOW what a punch! MashaAllah!  I did use organic raw sugar instead of processed sugar. And I used 1/2 tsp. of Himalayan Salt instead of table salt. 
Just Google the health benefits of horseradish and I am sure you will make this a staple in your cooking from now on! InshaAllah
Yesterday I added it to my sour cream to go along with my Cassava Fries and it was excellent !!!! MashaAllah!
Today, a bit of it in my rub for my chicken. So much flavor and such a punch to any dish!

I made it exactly as given. I think it depends on the freshness of the root because mine is bitter and a bit unpleasant.  It's in the fridge mellowing so maybe it will be less bitter later on. (Not taking stars off for that though.)  Still, beats store-bought any day.

Thank you BOOK_WORM! This saved me from going through all my old recipes. Exactly what I wanted. As far as the heat goes, I found the older gnarly roots are much hotter than the ones from young plants with almost carrot-like roots. They are harder to peel, too. I always replant the top of the cut root then try to remember which plants need to be dug up next (the hardest part!)

Love it.  I don't think it's "hot", but definitely strong smell wise. I used a Ninja. I advise working in steps to avoid eye/nose "burn".

I pretty much own an apology to everyone here. Here I was thinking people were a bunch of wimps. I tossed in the cubes, vinegar and salt (opted out of sugar) and whirred it around in the processor a few times, took the lid off a few times. Hah! Just you wait until it gets to the correct consistency and then wear a gas mask and protective goggles. I didn't even lean over it. I was way back and had to make a mad dash outside TWICE! I think I learned. :) It smells divine, or will once my nostrils are no longer scorched. Bravo to homemade horseradish. This recipe is not for wimps! ;)

I LOVE fresh horseradish!! So hot and tangy!  This recipe is the one!  The only thing I changed is I cut my vinegar back to 1/2 cup (I ran out!) and I omitted the sugar as others recommended ... it turned out great!  I'm serving this with our prime rib dinner on Christmas Day!  Thanks for sharing!

I make homemade horseradish every Thanksgiving.
We just moved and I can't find my favorite recipe so came here.  This recipe is the same except that mine calls for one small turnip to be added also. 
Thanks for having this recipe posted here.  :)

Great and very easy.  My processor doesn't chop the horseradish as smooth as I'd like, so the radish and the liquid seperate a bit, but still gets rave reviews.
