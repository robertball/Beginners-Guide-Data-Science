Yummmm...loved that this recipe called for 4 cups of pears as I had lots to use.  It makes the bread moist, moist.  I have found that if you toast the nuts (walnuts) for any recipe, it makes the flavor more pronounced.  After burning many batches of nuts, I've found that I can toast them PERFECTLY in the microwave.  For my oven it takes two minutes on high for a cup.
I made a little glaze for the top w/ butter, powdered sugar, a little maple extract and maple syrup.  Good enough to serve as a dessert.

I am in love with this recipe!!  It's so easy that even though I'm only fourteen it came out perfectly.  The only differences to mine were that I divided the recipe by four to get one loaf, used maple instead of vanilla extract, and whipped up a quick maple extract/Splenda/milk glaze to pour on top at the end, and it was absolutely delicious.  It was all gone before it even cooled off.  Thanks!

I grated 4 cups of pears in our food processor to save time and avoid chunky pieces in the bread. I took it to work and it was gone quickly.
this is a great way to use fresh local pears.

This was delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and left out the walnuts.  It was moist a very sweet.  Next time I'll try it with the walnuts.  Wonderful bread!

Excellent recipe, halved it to make one loaf but didn't change anything other then using wholemeal flour instead of white. Absolutely scrumptious and will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is awsome! I pulled the first batch out of the oven and it didn't have time to get cold my family dived into it right away and just kept eating until it was gone.

I made this as a dessert-type thing to have after a roast pork as I had an abundance of pears, and the whole family loved it. Yummy and moist, with a pleasant yet subtle taste of walnuts. Will be making this again!

I would have given this a 3 star but my husband LOVES it, so 4.  Too much cinnamon and vanilla really wipes out the pear taste...tasted just like a applesause bread in my mind.  Good, but not wow.  I tried it again using pear butter for more flavor and less cinnamon, less vanilla and more flour, and it was much better.  It just tastes like it needs something more...

Update:  Still excellent, but I made another batch with canned pears I needed to use up and not nearly as good as fresh.  FYI..so use either but fresh worked better for me.  Original:  Excellent...altho I couldn't really taste the pears.  Could have been my pears.  But the flavor and especially the texture of this bread was excellent.  I made six mini loaves because I was in a hurry.  I also cut way back on the cinnamon but that's because I have a bottle of Saigon cinnamon that I think has an especially strong flavor.

This recipe was good, although it was just a bit hard to really taste the pears. I substituted 2/4 applesauce for the oil.

This is the second year of making this bread. My family and nieghbors love it. My neighbors tree always has an abundance of pears so I'm always looking for a new recipe. I did substitute 1/2 cup of the sugar for brown sugar, and omitted the nuts. I usually leaves the pears chunky to really get the flavor. This year I'm going to make extra to freeze, so I may cut the pears smaller, so the bread doesn't get mushy when it defrosts. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was delicious! My 4 year old helped and she likes it also. I cut the recipe in half and used just one egg. Our pears were pretty ripe, so they were perfect for this bread. A great fall treat!

This was very a moist yummy bread. I substituted cranraisins  for the walnuts because nuts are not a big hit with my family. Other than that I did it exactly how it was written. Very good bread

Loved this recipe!! It's easy and tasty! I make a 3-4 loaves at a time and freeze some so I can have it often.  I left out the walnuts and went light on the sugar (using only 1 cup.) I highly recommend this recipe for people with pear trees in their yards at the end of season.

Love.  I feel like a superstar when I serve it.  I kept the pear pieces more chunky, for a rustic texture.  Don't skip the walnuts. They balance the sweetness of the bread perfectly.

OMGoodness! This was delicious. The perfect way to use up some already delicious pears that we couldn't eat fast enough. Made 3 loaves and one was gone before it was even cool. YUMMY!

Amazing bread.  I had a ton of pears from a neighbour's tree and this was one of the recipes I tried.  The first time was without the nuts. The second time I ran short of pears and substituted 1 cup of mashed banana for 1 cup of pear, forgot the lemon and left out the nuts. Could really taste the pear and the banana.  Great recipe!  Everyone loved it.

This bread got raves from my family.  It was easy to make and the bread really tasted of pear.  I left some of the pears finely chopped and some I mashed up a bit (they were very ripe) and the result was a very moist, delicious bread.  Will definitely make this again.

This bread turned out wonderful! I didn't have any walnuts on hand but still wanted some texture so I added a cup of oats instead. I even had very VERY ripe pears and it still worked perfectly. I added a maple honey glaze while it was cooling. It was gone within 5 minutes of my bringing in a loaf to work!

Ok, this was YUMMY!  I never heard of pear bread before seeing this recipe but I had a bag full of pears to use so I tried this recipe.  It was a HUGE hit with me and my family.  I also had other relatives over that just raved about it!  I also used 4 pears instead of 4 cups and I also added an extra egg because the recipe called for large eggs and the Davidson eggs are rather little.  I am going to make this again!

Really really good! If I did it again though I would not put in as much sugar (but my pears are Seckels so they're really sweet) and I'd probably smash the pears a little or cut them up smaller than i did. It looked like half pear chunks and half bread. YUMMY! But the bottom fell off the first on when I was taking it from the pan and the 2nd one broke in half when I was trying to carefully readjust it on the wire rack. Ack! It's a good dessert or sweet breakfast cake/bread.

Wow, now I have had some pear bread in my day but this was delicious. Now I am not an experienced chef at all, so I dont know whether it was my inexperience or what, but I didn't need as much stuff on the ingrediant list as it states. For example, I only used two cups of Pears, and didnt even use lemon juice, even though that is just a personal preference. In the end however, it turned out wonderful, and I will definately make this again. I am eating some as I write right now.

This bread is so good, however, I did make mine into muffins instead of loaves.  I shredded the pears in my food processor, and used pecans rather then walnuts.  Got 24 muffins that baked for about 23 minutes.  Will definately make again when gifted more pears from my friends tree!!

It was a delicious way to use overripe pears.  I had about 14 pears left over from canning and pear butter, that were much to soft to do anything else with.  I was able to mash them up with a fork and they worked perfectly.  No big mushy spots of pear, just a delicious moist flavor throughout the entire loaf.  Loved it!   I haven't tried it in this recipe, but you could probably sub half the flour for whole wheat flour.  I do that with my banana bread and it turns out very tasty.

Made as listed, just cut the recipe in half for one loaf.  Turned out great and was yummy!  Great use for 2 pears that had gotten a little bit too ripe.  I will make again.

This pear bread is Delicious!  It is so moist and has the perfect blend of spices.  My husband is very particular, but when he tasted this he was hooked!  This also freezes well and is great to give as a gift.

I had an abundance of pears that needed to be used. I was glad to find this recipe....and it turned out moist and yummy. I found that I liked it better if the pears were diced into small pieces. I ended up making 3 double batches and froze them. It'll be nice to have them in the winter!

Took to a group gathering - bread went in no time! Did not have enough pecans so threw in some raisins. Substituted 1/4 c. applesauce for 1/4 cup of the oil.
Made 4 mini loaves & 5 muffins with remaining batter.  Excellent at muffins as well.

Very good and a great way to use the abundance of pears from our pear trees.
