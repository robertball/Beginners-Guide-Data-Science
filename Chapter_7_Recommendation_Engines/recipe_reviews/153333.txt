This is a family favorite, and I use  this recipe all the time.  I like using a variety of jello flavors.  Really good with strawberry jello and fresh strawberries mixed into the cool whip, also orange jello with mandarin oranges on top of the cool whip, raspberry with raspberries, etc.  Have also done one cake layer with any red jello flavor and a cake layer of blue raspberry jello for July 4th picnics! Makes for very dramatic slices of a patriotic-looking dessert!

I use Instant Vanilla Pudding as a topping on my jello poke cake. Might want to try this but, you can bake it in an oblong cake pan also. This is one of my favorite cakes.

This cake is SOOO good! I used strawberry Jello instead of the black cherry. I'm sure you could use any flavor and this cake would still be delicious! 5 stars!!!!

This is soooo good....cool, light and refreshing. Everytime I make this people rave; they can't believe how good it is and how easy to make! Love this cake, plus you can change it up by using different jello flavors/colors.

Easy, pretty AND delicious!  What else could I ask for in a cake.  I used regular jello instead of the sugar-free variety, and decorated with maraschino cherries on top.

When I was growing up, Jell-O Poke cakes were popular, and I enjoyed making them.  However, as I hadn't made it in years, I couldn't remember how to do it and was thrilled to find it here!   I made the following modifications: I used raspberry jello and baked it in a 9 X 13 pan (as I did as a teenager).  I also used fresh raspberries on top of the whipping cream (I mixed up fresh whipping cream each night I served it to the family).  Delicious!  Thanks for helping me find a long sought recipe!

I surprised my mom with this cake for her birthday.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  It's super moist.  You can play around with what kind of cake mix you use, and also with different flavors of Jello.  This recipe is a keeper!

My family loves this Jello cake especially with strawberry Jello. This is much much better with real whipped cream and it holds up a lot better too!  I add a 2/3 cup of powdered sugar to a quart of whipping cream and beat with a mixer until it is stiff. It spreads better, stays on the cake better, and tastes better than cool whip.

This is really good. I like using chocolate cake with raspberry jello...the only problem is that you can't see the jello that runs through.  I also put raspberries all over the cool whipped topping and it looked so nice!

I made this cake but made each layer a different flavor/color.  For that I used one box per layer.  The inside was super cool looking.  So yummy!

Ive had this cake before, but never made it. For some reason the coolwhip kept melting so fast before I could ice the cake! Next time I will mix some cream cheese and confect sugar to make a stiffer icing so it doesnt look like a melting blob. :(

I don't know what I did wrong, but I ended up with cake topped with Jello, nothing like the picture.
