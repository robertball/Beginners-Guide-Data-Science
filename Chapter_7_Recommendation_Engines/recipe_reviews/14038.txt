This was so good! It reminded me and my husband of chicken nuggets!  this would be a great appetiser for people who have not tried tempeh before. I marinated the tempeh first though , in some tamari, garlic, water , and olive oil. I strongly suggest marinating since tempeh can be bland. I also didnt have green onion so i minced about 2 TBS yellow onion instead.  Also, the instructions talk about garlic, but no garlic is mentioned in the ingredients, so i just guessed. AND i admit i didnt use as much oil!  so i dont know if it was because of that or if the batter was too thin, but i found that drizzling a little extra batter over each peice is DELICIOUS!  It turned out very good and i would definately make it again! We ate ours with ketchup!  YUM!

I put sliced green onion (scallion)and 1/4 tsp cumin in the batter, and cut 1/2 inch thick, or even thinner than that, to make it crunchier. yummy...

My two year old ate most of these before I could finish making dinner. I, too, marinated them in about 1T of liquid aminos, and the garlic called for in the recipe. I used 1/4c less water than what was called for and it coated well. Anything my tot will eat we will make again and again.

I left a few ingredients out because I didn't have them on hand, but this was dangerously delicious. I seriously wish I had sweet and sour sauce on hand. Sooo yummy.

I am by no means an excellent cook, but this one was my worst attempt, according to my husband. We ended up sending out for pizza.
