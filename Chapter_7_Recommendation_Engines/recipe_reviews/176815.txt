Great recipe!  We served it over couscous--if I served it over couscous again I would make the sauce thinner with more lemon juice and less tahini.  But the recipe as is should be great over pita, I reckon.

this is a very easy recipe, but is not for kids, the sauce is a strong flavor, just as i like it¡¡... but i`ve cooked the fish over a pan in the stove, and at the middle of cooking time, i poured the sauce, cause i like the most if is it warm... the parsley was sprinkled at the plate... excellent middle east recipe¡¡¡¡

Not 100% disgusting, but I didn't like it at all.  My wife thought this too lemony, and I thought it was too "sesame seedy".  The parsley helped mellow this out.  I won't be making this again.

The sauce was very nice.  I didn't have tahini, so I substituted 3 parts peanut butter and 1 part sesame oil (from a hint I saw somewhere else on the web).  My son didn't like it at all.  I didn't care for the sauce with the fish.  My husband and boarder both gobbled it down.  I think I'll try to find something else to put the sauce on.

My BF called it interesting. Sorry, I didn't like this one. I'll save my tahini for hummus.
