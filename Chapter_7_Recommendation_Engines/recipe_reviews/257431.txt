4.10.18 This really is super simple to make and I was able to empty my big container of Cabot Lowfat Plain Greek Yogurt (yay now more room in the fridge). The texture is different than any quick bread I ve ever made and that s not intended as negative just different. However it is very moist not dense but not totally light either (hope that makes sense) sweet but somewhat neutral in flavor. I was looking for something that would be a bit different from a buttery pound cake flavor to spoon some fresh fruit or a fruit sauce over and I think this will work well...I'll know tonight! ASweeney thanks for a tasty new recipe. UPDATE 4.11.18 As I mentioned yesterday the texture of this bread is just a bit different so I wondered how it would toast. Well it was delicious this morning as a thick slice of toast spread with plum preserves. Liking this versatile bread more and more.

Honestly I really enjoyed this!  I had some excess homemade yogurt that I wanted to use. It tastes like a nice dessert bread. It was very easy to make, very easy to stir. The batter was very liquidy. It filled a bread pan to the top.  (I measured the yogurt, but I think I may have been a little generous. I also used large eggs.)  I ended up using a ladle to take some out and fill two mini loaf pans. I couldnâ€™t be happier with the turnout!  Next time I think I will see if the recipe works just as well with whey instead of yogurt.

I made this recipe and it came out fabulous.  The only thing I did differently was to put two teaspoons of vanilla extract into the batter.   I would definitely make this again.  It's a great way to use up yogurt that would otherwise go to waste.

I did not make any changes.  I will make it again. Had leftover yoghurt that I didn't want to waste. Tastes like something between bread and cake.
