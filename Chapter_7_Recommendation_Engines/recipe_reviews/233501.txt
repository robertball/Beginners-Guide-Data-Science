First off, I LOVED the flavor of this soup and how easy it was to make. I used Jennie-O Italian sausage (3 links = 3/4lb). I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, about 2/3 of a bag, and that's just because of personal preference. I did not add any salt and it was plenty salty. I can't imagine having added 2 tsp. Of course, if you use unsalted chicken broth or low sodium, you'll want to add salt to taste.  The issue I had was that because you are cooking the barley for so long to get it tender, a lot of the liquid evaporates, leaving you with 6 very small servings (about 6oz each). I had even added 1 cup of water to the pot.  In my opinion, this makes 3 lunch size portions, so plan accordingly. I will definitely be making this again though, with the extra liquid. Thank you Juli for the tasty and healthy recipe!

I really like this soup. I just thought it needed more meat (I used 1.25lbs) and less salt. I recommend tasting it before you add any salt and then adding a 1/4 of a tsp at a time (if any.) I only used 1 tsp, and I thought that was a little bit too much, even after adding 3 cups of water.

I exchanged kale for spinach and it was amazing. My husband said it was the best soup I have ever made.
