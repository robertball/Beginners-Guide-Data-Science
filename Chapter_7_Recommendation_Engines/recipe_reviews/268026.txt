If you'd like to do a complete Irish feast, remove the trivet while your brisket is resting and place baby carrots, quartered red potatoes, and cabbage wedges in the bottom of the Instant Pot. Secure the lid, lock, seal, and select the manual setting. Set for 5 minutes. Do a quick release. The rested brisket and vegetables are ready at the same time.

Fantastic! I had previously tried making a corned beef in my Instant Pot with terrible results - tough and dry and a trip to the trash. I decided to try again using this recipe and it was PERFECT! Juicy, tender....cannot...stop....eating....it! This is how I'll be making my corned beef from now on!  UPDATE: I have made this at least half a dozen times since and it's perfection every time, whether using the point or flat cut.

This is probably the best corned beef I’ve ever had. I used hard cider instead of beer (it’s what I had, and I don’t like beer anyway) and it was absolutely delicious. So tender and flavorful! And very easy in the instant pot.

This was delicious!! The whole family gave it rave reviews. I followed a suggestion of cooking cabbage and potatoes and carrots while the meat rested. Perfect accompaniment. The only problem was I should have bought a larger brisket! The broth was so delicious I used it to make vegetable sup with the leftover veggies. I added a can of diced tomatoes and drained white beans, a bit of Italian seasoning and fresh ground pepper.  This will become a St. Patrick’s Day traditional meal!

Hands down the easiest I've made. I made it exactly to the recipe with a Guinness and didn't find anything out of balance. I rinsed the meat before placing on the trivet just to get the salt solution off. While it rested I did one head of cabbage cut into 6 wedges, about 5 carrots, a bag of parsnips (both coarsely chopped),  and a whole bag of baby red potatoes un cut in the cooking liquid for 5 min on high from another review.  Everything turned out perfect. Next year I'll brine my own again but I will definitely cook it this way.

I added a sliced onion and used Guinness in the Cuckoo Pressure Cooker that I recently purchased. I only had a 3 qt Instant Pot that I didn't think was large enough. Anyway, the corned beef was delightfully tender. I added cabbage, carrots, and potatoes after I removed the corned beef. I shared it with a neighbor and he said childhood memories came back as he remembered eating corned beef with Irish neighbors. We ate it over rice with some of the sauce and it was delicious.

Made this today, only thing added was I trimmed most of the fat cap off, fat side down, light coating of mustard to hold spice packet contents in place and a light dusting of brown sugar.  For beer, I used Hackerphschorr Oktoberfest beer. O M G The Best Corned Beef we have ever had and we make Corned Beef a lot in this home.  Now I know why I have this InstaPot!  Wow, Wow, Wow!

This is one of the best meals I’ve ever made in my Instant Pot.  I added a sliced onion to the broth, but other than that I made it as specified.

Mine turned out like deli corned beef with a subtle hint of beer... not at all stringy like in some of the pictures.

I’ll be making this again.  Try it — you won’t be disappointed!

The reason it's turning out dry for some people is they're cooking it too long. I used a 2.9lb cut of corned beef and I cooked it on top of the raised metal insert thing for 60 minutes, then let it natural release for 14 minutes, then I manually let the rest of the pressure out slowly. I had 2 cups of water in there along with a 12oz bottle of Guinness, pickling spice, & garlic.
The meat was cooked perfectly, 170° very tender. Then I followed Nicole's recommendation and took the meat out, strained the liquid, then added baby carrots and brussel sprouts (cuz i didn't feel like doing cabbage) with some salt and pepper. I set the meat on top of the carrots/brussel sprouts and added in about an inch deep of the strained liquid, and cooked it for 5 more minutes. The brussel sprouts weren't soft yet so after that I took the meat out & sliced it, and cooked the sprouts/carrots by themselves in the liquid for another 5 minutes. I think I had too much liquid in there at the end that's why it took longer to cook the brussel sprouts. Anyway it turned out epic, I would say cook the meat for 20 minutes per pound, and then let it natural release for 10-15 minutes depending on the weight of the meat

I followed Soup Loving Nicole’s suggestion and the meal turned out terrific. I used Guinness for the beer. Recommend allowing a bit more time for the prep and cooker preheat but otherwise delicious!

Made this last night for dinner.  I am so pleased with the results.  It came out perfectly.  I followed the directions exactly as they were written.  It’s great to have a corned beef recipe that I can cook in just a few hours in my IP instead of all day in my slow cooker.  This one’s a keeper!

Perfect recipe for making the most tender corned beef. 90 minutes works every time in the IP! Since my beef was missing the spice packet, I used my own spice mix. I used Two Brother's Gluten Free beer, which has the taste of a dark ale. Served this two ways...for hubs on Rye Bread with mustard and cheese only, and for me as a Reuben Lettuce Wrap. It is easier to thinly slice the meat the next day after it sits in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not a very good cook, so I stuck to the recipe. It turned out perfect. I was shocked that the veggies were just right after only 5 minutes. The corned beef was so tender.

I tried this recipe for  St Patric’s Day and it is a winner. I cooked a 5lb corned beef; I increased the liquid to 4 cups. Instead of water, I used beef broth and a bottle of Guinness. I also threw in 2 bay leaves, a small onion and 5 cloves of garlic chopped. The corned beef came out flavorful and not too salty, and did not seem to shrink significantly, which happens with boiling.  I then pressured cooked potatoes and carrots for 5 minutes, and then the cabbage for 3 minutes in the broth after I removed the corned beef from the pot; they came out perfectly cooked.  A great one pot meal!

Made exactly as described, and followed the review suggestions of adding potatoes and carrots at the end. Came out amazing. Had never made corned beef before and just got an Instant Pot. I wish I bought a bigger piece of corned beef.

Absolutely delicious. I rinsed the beef several times to remove some salt. Tender. I added potatoes and carrots with the cabbage as suggested by other review. Cooked them 5 minutes after removing the corned beef to sit.and natural release.

I have tried to make corned beef in the instant pot several times. It has always turned out terrible.  This recipe got it right! Instead of beer, I used orange juice. It was delicious and really tender!

This was a delicious and easy way to make corned beef.  We did put the fat side up so as to keep the meat moist.  It made great leftovers - corned beef hash and Ruben sandwiches.

Great recipe, did not change a thing,  since it was St. Patrick's day I used a 12 oz bottle of Smithwick.  I also use the idea of after the corn beef was done I added the carrots and cabbage cooked those for 10 min and everything came out perfect.  Will defiantly be cooking corn beef again soon not just in March.

very tender, I substituted beef broth for the water, and in the future will not use beer, but maybe a splash of red wine.

Dang!  Easy and delicious!  Will make more often than once a year now...  We have to adjust all our cooking to low sodium due to kidney disease, so we rinsed the brisket and soaked it in cold water for 1 hour before cooking, and it made a big difference in the saltiness.  We didn't have beer on hand, so I substituted low-sodium beef broth for the water and dry sherry (not cooking sherry) for the beer, to try to make up for the flavor imparted for the beer.  Also followed up with the directions for potatoes and cabbage while the brisket was resting -- so good!  Thank you Soup Loving Nicole for a wonderful recipe and a great tip for the accompanying sides!

Didn’t make any changes to the recipe and my family and I thought it was the best brisket I’ve cooked. I really enjoyed the Reuben sandwich I made from it.

This came out well.  My corned beef was a bit bigger than 3 lbs. and I wished I had added a bit more cooking time to it to make it a bit more tender.  Also, I probably cut the slices too thick.  Great recipe.  I am a new IP user and am really enjoying trying different food in it.

Corned Beef turned out great! Cooking vegetables while the meat was resting worked out very well.

I cooked the corned beef as per the recipe.  Then I took the suggestion of another review and put the potatoes, onions and carrots in while the meat rested.   I should have waited for the meat to cool a little but everyone was hungry and it smelled great so the meat was shredded and enjoyed.
I will ,make tis again

I made it as is.  I used Guinness Draught for the beer.   The brisket came out nice and tender and very flavorful.  The family loved it.  Thank you for this recipe.

Wow! This was by far, one of the BEST corned beefs we have ever had. I used beef stock  instead of water and beer for the liquids, and it came out so flavorful and juicy. I will never cook this any other way!

This is very very dry.  I found 90 minutes much too long.  I'm going to try again at 45 and see how that turns out.  Just as in boiling, if its too long it just turns hard.  Unfortunately you don't have the luxury of checking on the process with an instant pot.  I'll let you know how it turned out with 45 min.

Made this tonight with 3.5 lb brisket.  I’d say it was perfect.  The vegetables took 8 minutes to cook. I used Killian Irish Red beer and I did rub it down with Grey poupon mustard.  Just me and my wife and there wasn’t enough left for leftovers.

I used four cups of beef stock in the pot with meat and it came out tender and super flavorful! While the brisket was resting, I tossed baby potatoes and carrots in the broth and cooked those for 15 min. PERFECTION!

I made one change. I didn't have any beer, so I used chicken stock.  I added veggies as suggested while the meat rested. Corned beef was tender and moist. The whole meal was a hit with my family and so easy to make. This one's a keeper. Thank you for submitting.

Very tender & flavorful meat. I didn’t have beer, so used dry hard cider. Must admit I didn’t care as much for the taste, so next time will use beef broth or water. Otherwise, delicious & so easy.

After many years of making Corned Beef and by many different methods this was absolutely the best. The meat could not have been more tender and tasty. I followed one reviewer’s advice and cooked the potatoes, cabbage and carrots in the pressure cooker after the brisket was done.

I followed this recipe exactly and the corned beef turned out so dry it was inedible. Never again!

My kids and my husband like my slow cooker version much better.  Won’t use this recipe again.

Way too salty! Meat was tender but couldn’t eat it. Maybe it would be better if you doubled the water?

I used a 3# flat corned beef.  Followed recipe exactly using high pressure setting.  Flavor was good, but meat was so tough!  From what I've read on line I probably should have used the low pressure setting.  Very disappointing.
