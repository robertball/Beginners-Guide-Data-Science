The first words my husband’s said after taking a bite are “these are awesome. I didn’t know chocolate would go so well with maple.”  Silly man, if he was a woman he’d know chocolate goes with everything.  But anyway, I followed the recipe exactly using dark chocolate chips (personal preference.)   These won’t last long in this house.  Thanks for sharing!

A good base recipe to which many fun flavors could be added.  Tasty, but more of a chocolate shortbread than a "toffee."

Good start. Maple flavoring is a great idea!  But the texture was all wrong. Adding half shortening made the bars too soft. Would have been really great to have a firm, flaky shortbread texture. All butter might be a good idea. I'll try it again that way.

These are very good, they make the house smell great too! I sell baked goods to make ends meet and these sell like hot cakes. Just have to be careful to keep an eye on the walnuts when toasting so they don't start to burn (due to different sizes in the chop).
