Oh yum.  The other reviewers are right, this bread is very pretty. As always, I made a few changes.  First, I used 3 T ground flaxseed and toasted it with the other seeds.  There's really no point in using whole flax seeds as most of the nutrients can't be extracted through chewing and digesting alone.  Using ground seeds will still give you that robust flax flavor and all of the wonderful omega-3s.  You can buy ground flax seed or you can grind your own in a food processor/blender.  I added 2 t of raw sunflower seeds to make up for the missing crunch from the flax seeds.  Instead of honey, I used blackstrap molasses (this has an unbelievable amount of vitamins and nutrients and is rather tasty), which may have given the bread a stronger flavor than with honey, but it was still delicious.  I put all ingredients in my bread machine and set it on the dough cycle.  At the end of the cycle, I put the dough in a very lightly greased clear glass loaf pan and baked it at 375 for 30 minutes.  The crust was crunchy and flavorful, while the interior was moist and lighter than you might think.   I will definitely make this again.

This is a great bread recipe, Donna. I've only made 12 loaves in 8 days. What does that tell ya? The seed combination adds a nice nutty flavor.I didn't take time to toast the seeds, but other than that, I did exactly as the recipe states. Didn't have to change a thing to get a beautiful loaf of very flavorful bread. As another reviewer commented, this is pretty enough to give as gifts. This recipe makes me look like a skilled baker, but its sooo easy my granddaughter can do it.All 12 loaves have come out perfect every time. I use the dough cycle, then shape the loaf, place it in a 9X5 bread pan, and bake at 375 degrees for exactly 32 minutes. WoW! GREAT BREAD!!

For those not using a bread machine: While the seeds are toasting, blend the yeast into 1/4C of the water, (warmed), along with the honey, (warmed) and the salt. Wait for bubbles to form, and then add the remaining water and the oil. In another bowl mix the flour and the seeds, (I didn't wait for them to cool), and mix into the liquid to create a ball of dough. Cover with a towel and allow to rise in a warm place. The stovetop worked nicely, since the oven had been on. I left it for a half an hour and got a small loaf. I'm not sure whether it would have risen further had I waited longer, as I used regular white flour rather than bread flour, but under less hurried circumstances I'd have left it for an hour. From here I followed ItsJustaRide's baking directions. This was lovely toasted with butter for breakfast. My parents put jam on it and said it was very good, but I didn't think it needed any.

This is a really great loaf bread; perfect for sandwiches, heavenly as toast, great for grilled sandwiches, and just right when you simply want a fresh slice to hold some honey or butter. 

It doesn't need any changes - you can make it just as directed and it will come out perfectly every time.  If you want a variation, however, it is perfectly amenable to tinkering. I frequently add oat bran, diastatic malt, and/or sunflower seeds.  I often change the bread flour to a mix of plain and whole wheat flour (although when I do this, I add a tablespoon of wheat gluten to the mix, and increase the yeast quantity to 2 1/2 tsp.) For a sweeter version, I simply increase the honey and add a handful of currents.

I bake almost all the breads my family eats; traditional, artisan, flat breads, rolls, braids, you name it.  That being said, this is the best "everyday" loaf recipe I've come across, and I thank Donna Beth for sharing it.

This bread comes out perfect every time.  I make the dough in my bread machine and then bake it in a long loaf on my baking stone.  Really tasty with an excellent texture.  Pretty enough to give away!

This is a nice light bread.  Very good taste and texture.  It's the best multigrain bread I've ever made in my bread machine.

Very good. Makes a small loaf (probably 1 lb).
Changes I made because I had no poppy seeds: 2 tbsp of flax seeds, 1 tbsp+2 tsp sunflower seeds. I love the taste of sunflower seeds in bread.

This was a delicious and savoury recipe.  The grains and nuts give it a very satisfying texture and flavour.  The dough was a bit too sticky and I had to add a little flour but it still turned out beautifully.

I found this recipe in a magazine years ago and had lost it, only to find it again here!  I was thrilled to see how many freat reviews it had.  It is also my fave bread.  I scaled this recipe to 18 servings for a 1.5 loaf in a breadmachine, which was perfect on medium crust with one package of yeast (2 1/4 tsp). A new tip to give this great recipe some variety: try different kinds of honey (buckwheat honey for a more molasses taste, orange blossom honey for a sweet fragrant taste, etc), which really gives a personal touch. I also use a variety of nuts like other reviewers have suggested, and toasting them is great. if you toast them, however, make sure they are cool before you add them or that they do not touch the yeast or you will fry the yeast and end up with no rise.

dear me, another bread maker failure for me---i look at that photo of that beautiful loaf and want to weep:  my hard, craggy, lumpy "bread" looked *nothing* like that and i followed the recipe to the letter...i have no idea what i'm doing wrong, but the result was a hard lump of baked dough with burnt seeds stuck to the bottom...same thing happened when i tried to make cinnamon raisin bread from this site...if anyone can tell me what i'm doing wrong, please do, because i don't want to be relegated to making *just* the recipes from the manufacturer's handbook!

I didn't have any wholewheat flour so just used white bread flour. I also made a boo boo and put in 3 cups of flour so added an extra 1/2 cup of water and 2 tsps of honey (we like it sweeter). I also mixed the yeast with warmed water and, as my bread machine likes the wet ingredients first, let it sit in the bread machine with the other ingredients. This actually rose over the top of the pan and tastes like shop bought unsliced bread. Toasting the seeds really helps with the flavour. I will use this as my new basic bread recipe from now on and make alterations to make wholemeal, white, malted etc. Thankyou xx

Great recipe as is!
My kitchen has 2 rules: if you are making something good, double the recipe, and clean up.
I don't use a bread machine, I use a stand mixer with a dough hook.  Do toast the seeds, and for that matter, anytime you use nuts or seeds, in salads, brownies, pecan pie... toast them, adds a wonderful flavor you can't get any other way.
I use a slow rise, all day or overnight technique. For the loaves I made yesterday (gone now!) I doubled + some. Started with 1 3/4 cups water. Put half of that in a cup, microwaved till temp is 110 f.  Stir in honey, and stir in only 1/2 teaspoon yeast.  Let it proof an hour or 2 until foamy on top(this makes a bottle last a long time).  Meanwhile, mix whole wheat flour, and about 3/4 cup rolled oats, salt and oil, and the other half of the water in the mixer, knead with dough hook about 5 min.  Toast seeds, mix in.  Add proofed yeast to mixer, add bread flour as much as needed until dough isn't sticky, and streches when pulled.
Gather dough into ball, spread 1/2 tsp oil outside of dough and inside of bowl, let rise at room temp for hours- overnight or all day. I keep it in the microwave, it's draught free, and the cats can't get at it... If a faster rising is needed, remove dough from microwave, nuke a cup of water until the water is hot, keep hot water in microwave, return dough.  When dough is doubled in volume, punch down, shape into 2 loaves, in buttered loaf pans, or freeform, bake 375f about 25 min.

Love this bread!  I have made this bread four times, and it is a favorite.  I scaled to 15 servings for a 2 lb. loaf and increased the yeast to 2 tsp.  Otherwise I followed the recipe. I toasted the seeds in my toaster oven using the small pan that came with it.  Very easy to do.  Thank you for submitting.  Update: I tried this without toasting the seeds first as some reviewers suggested -- big difference!  Much, much better with toasted seeds and well worth the effort.

This is my staple bread recipe which I have used all the time for several years now. It is splendid plain, but even better with cranberry and walnuts. I also add raisins and grated carrot/apple recently with a teaspoon of cinnamon. I have this recipe printed. x3 to make 2 loaves or one big loaf.

As plain untoasted bread, this was just okay.  Toasted and turned into BLT's, this made an awesome sandwich!  I think I'll only make this when we are planning on BLT's.  For every-day, a simple wheat bread suits us better.  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe!  I have been using my bread machine on a regular basis since we put our house up for sale.  Nothing invites a potential buyer into your house more than the smell of homebaked bread!  I followed this recipe exactly, but played around with some of the suggestions other posters have made.  In addition to using 4 T. honey, I toasted the sesame seed and sunflower seeds (substitution for poppy seeds as I had none) and added them after they cooled with the ground flax seed when the machine signaled.  But the best addition I made was when I put some raisins and craisins in hot water to which I added some pure vanilla extract.  When they plumped up, I added them with the seeds.  The dough seemed slightly moist so I added some wheat bran.  The dough looks small, but don't panic as it rises beautifully.  This was the kind of hearty bread I have longed for, but never thought I could get out of a bread machine.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

Love this--thanks!  It's a bit dry now, but since I didn't eat it as soon as I made it, I'm not surprised.  Just had a sandwich with it and I love it.  I subbed pine nuts for flax seed--didn't have any, and baked in oven for 30 min at 375.  Came out golden brown.

I got a brand new bread machine for Mother's Day today and decided to make this bread. It is goooone! Gobbled up in minutes.
Moist and tender centre and crusty exterior. Honey did add a lot of sweetness so if you don't think you like a sweet taste with grains then halve the honey. I didn't have flax so I used sunflower seeds like another reviewer suggested and made sure not to add too many grains to overtake. I also added a couple of shakes of onion powder. Fantastic!

The first time I baked this bread, it didn't rise quite enough, so I scalded it to 1.5 to suit my 1 1/2 lb loaf bread machine, and it turned out quite tasty. Will bake it again.

Wonderful-I added a little more water and 2 Tablespoons of millet into the mix. This was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside and soooo tasty. It sliced really well too-it was great for sandwiches.

WOW!!! This is perhaps my favorite bread recipe!! The taste of the toasted seeds is just fabulous! I gave this recipe to my mom, my sister and my aunt, and everybody love it! In fact, my father (who is a breakfast cereal man) will eat this bread the morning if there is some in the house.  I tried not toasting the seed once, but the taste is far better when they're toasted.

Easy and great! I may never have to buy store bought whole grain bread again. Add 1/2 cup sunflower seeds at the end of the dough cycle for a even seedier bread and nuttier taste.

Delicious, moist, complete protien, yum. I added a bunch of seeds (not really measuring) including sunflower and hemp, and didn't toast anything. Other than that, didn't change a thing. Yum.

Made 2 loaves, 1 with roasted seeds, the other with raw seeds.  I also increased the whole wheat flour to 1 cup, and decreased the bread flour to 1 cup. Very good breads!  We prefer the nutty flavor of the one with the roasted seeds more!  We will be making this again!

This was really great bread, I am definately making this again.
I ground the flax (linseeds)so they digested easily and provided the anitoxidants, and then toasted them with the rest of the seeds.
The consistancy was very good, very impressed.
Thanks for the recipe Donna

This is the best bread i have tasted. My parents just love it. Of all the breads, they said that this was the best. I followed the suggestions to sub sunflower seeds for poppy seeds.

My kids LOVE this bread. It comes out perfectly every time. I make a loaf for dinner and then the next day use the leftovers for sandwiches or french toast. I don't change a thing in the recipe -- it's just perfect!

This bread was easy to make and tasted amazing.  I used the bread machine to make the dough, as per suggestions of others, but when I took it out of the bread machine it looked small sitting in the greased glass baking dish.  I decided to let the dough rise for about an hour and it more than doubled in size before baking.  I am very glad I did this last step prior to baking since it probably would have been very dense otherwise.  I baked it at 400 for the first 5 minutes and then finished it at 350 for the last 25.  My main suggestion to those of you whom use the bread maker for the dough and then bake it in the oven is let it rise first! : )

Really good bread. This is my first time using my bread machine and I'm hooked. I will use this recipe again but will tinker with the ratios of flour as I like more whole wheat

I have made both this and the Flax and Sunflower Seed bread quite a few times. This recipe, I believe, has a nuttier flavor and a better aftertaste.

So delicious.  I cooked it in my breadmaker and increased the ingredients to make 1  1/2 pound loaf.  I used flax meal instead of seeds.  I didn't have sesame seeds on hand, and I added 1/4 c. each of crushed walnuts and macadamia nuts to make up for it.  I will making this bread a lot!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! I scaled up to 15 servings to get a taller loaf, and increased yeast to 2 tsp. I used a seed mixture from King Arthur Flour, and added additional flax seeds. Baked at 375* F for 30 minutes. The family loved this, and have been requesting a loaf every couple of days! Thank you for the great recipe.

Wonderful. Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews. If you do this by hand and add sunflower seeds - like I did - add the seeds when you're just about done kneading, otherwise they just keep falling off.

This is truly the best bread!  I think you could add almost any seed type and have it turn out well.  I stick to the recipe for the most part, but took the idea from someone else yo add more honey (I use 6 tsp.) I also add 1/4 c. raisens and 1/4 c. craisens (dried cranberries) following the directions that came with my bread machine.  We love the fruit and nutty taste.  I'd give this bread a 6 if I could.

This is my family's favorite homemade bread.  I only make one change.  The first time I made this bread I accidently added 4 tablespoons of honey instead of 4 teaspoons. It was so good that I have continued to do the same thing every time.

I mixed this recipe in my machine and baked it in the oven. It was good, but not phenomenal, as other reviews suggested. However, I was hesitant to add all the amounts of seeds listed, so I used only half. Next time, I will add them all, and see if I liked it more. Thanks for the recipe!

O.M.G......this is the BEST  bread I have ever made!  I used a bread machine.  No poppy seeds but did put the sesame in and 1/4 cup quinoa,  1/4 cup pepitas, 1/4 cup millet, 1/4 cup sunflower seeds.  So nutty and good!  Thank you to whoever posted it!

After trying this recipe as written, I have made some changes to suit my taste simply because I didn't like the flax seed taste and how the original recipe performed in my bread machine--the top kept falling in.   This is a truly wonderful bread for anyone who likes a little more flavorful bread.  My changes if they could help anyone else:  instead of the oil, I use 4 t. soft butter; I add an additional 1/3 cup flour; up the salt to 1 1/4 t;  increase the bread machine yeast to 2 teaspoons; and use 1/4 cup toasted sunflower seeds midway through the second knead cycle.  I don't use any of the other seeds although I'd love the sesame if I had my own teeth, lol.  I process for 1.5 lb loaf on regular cycle with light crust.  This is really good for about anything -- sliced, toasted, french toast or sandwiches.  I also find that it keeps well for 2 - 3 days.

I love this bread. 
I make it all the time. 
The most recent time I made it I reduced the flax a little and added quinoa and chia seeds. Its a great bread using the original recipe or changing up the seeds as well. I toasted the seeds for the first time and it gives it a great flavour.
Thanks for this recipe!

I bought a bread machine about 2 months ago and this bread may be the best wheat bread I have tried so far taste wise. My only change, when adding the ingredients to the machine, were using 1 tablespoon of flax meal and 2 tablespoons of roasted unsalted sunflower seeds for the flax seeds. I just don't care for flax seeds. I also used Gold Medal's white whole wheat flour. Note: I noticed this was not enough dough to make a loaf of bread in my 2lb Zojirushi bread machine. It has a rectangle pan and makes standard loaves only. I suggest, if this is the type of bread maker available, to double the recipe or bake in the oven. As it was too late to double the recipe, I took the dough out after the 2nd rise and right before it started the baking cycle in the machine. I lined a baking sheet with parchment, sprayed it with PAM, and lightly sprinkled a circle of cornmeal on it. I gently placed the dough in a circle. It did deflate some, so I lightly sprayed it with olive oil and covered with plastic wrap. I let it rise about 25 minutes more while preheating the oven to 375. It had a nice rounded dome shape by that point. I baked it 25 minutes, let it cool 7-8 minutes on the pan, and then transferred to a cooling rack. Had one warm slice to see if it baked up and it is delicious. ty

I have been making bread for years and this is one of the best IMHO. Everyone loved it including my son who is very picky about his bread as he worked in an artisan bakery as a student. I have been given the task of providing Easter dinner for our large Italian family and this is the bread that I will be making.

I made two small changes, I added wheat gluten and formed it into two small, round loafs that I baked on a pizza stone.

Really good bread.  I got the bright idea to make 1 1/2 times the original recipe and adjusted it to 15 servings.  It outgrew the bread machine pan so I had quite a mess. Still good and I will make this again, not increasing the amount.

This is wonderful!  It has become our favorite bread and it bakes well in our bread machine,doubling for a beautiful, large loaf. (I don't toast the seeds though--too lazy!!)

The first time I made it I didn't have flax so added sunflower seeds.  Very good. Now I add 2tbsp sunflower seed every time.  If using bread machine yeast, the equivalent is just a bit over 3/4 tsp instead of the 1 1/4 tsp active dry yeast.

Pretty good. Made delicious toast. This had a quick bread, almost cake-like crumb. I suspect the culprit is gluten. Next time, I will add 1-2 TB. Whole wheat flour usually needs a little.

I doubled the batch and it only made two small loaves. the bread took a long time to rise, and didn't hold together on the sides.  i baked in 375 for 30min at 5000ft elevation (colorado). i would add a tablespoon or two of gluten and another 1/2 t of yeast.

This bread was awesome. I used what seeds I had, sunflower, sesame, and chia and it was so soft. Even my 11 year old loved it. I too do not use a bread machine, so I just kneaded it, let it rise till double, punched it down and let it rise again. It worked fine. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

My husband and I liked this bread. I did not use bread machine, but instead mixed yeast with honey and then added that to flour and seed mixture, as other users have suggested. I did toast the seeds and I think that gives the bread much better flavor. I changed the recipe a bit tough. I added about 1/4 cup of buckwheat flour and added some toasted pumpin and sunflower seeds to the mix. I doubled the recipe and made two small loaves. I would make this bread again. I baked it at 350F for 25 minutes.

Finally a healthy bread that is not so heavy that you could use it as a door stop.  I did double the recipe because I have a 3 lb machine, I also used some molasses, wheat gluten and buttermilk.  Good texture

This was my first bread machine bread... Wow!!!!!  The only change I made was omitting poppy seeds & adding the equilivant amount of 10-grain cereal. The only problem now will be that my husband will want fresh bread daily.

I did this recipe with some difference because I live in Europe and we do not have all purpose flour here. I used a pre made flour mix called "Multicereal flour mix" (Pao Vitale)and did not have to add the seeds as this contained it. I then followed the rest of the recipe and it turns out fabulous. Give this a try.

Baked 3 loaves of this bread today! Kneaded the dough for about 5 minutes with a Kenwood mixer, 1st proving for 1hour,  divided dough and shaped into loaf pans, 2nd proving for 45 minutes. Followed the reccomendation of a reviewer to bake at 375F for 32 minutes. Turned out perfectly! Tasted great too. The only thing I did not do was to toast the seeds. This is my attempt at a seed bread. Am sure glad I picked this recipe. Will definitely bake this bread again.

Definitely yummy and versatile-- add whatever seeds you want!  Just make sure to use the one pound loaf setting and the light crust.  I made two batches where it was overbaked and ended up using it for croutons.

Very nice and very easy recipe. I accidentally added sunflower seeds instead of flax (don't ask me how I misread that one!) and they worked really well. I found the poppy seeds a bit weird though - like they added almost a gritty texture (my husband disagreed and loved the poppy seeds). I'll definately make this one again.

Best bread I've made. Right density great for breakfast or as sandwich. Poppy seeds are not sold in my country (it's banned!) so I did away with it and added 1/3 cup of sunflower seeds. Turns out perfect. Thanks loafs!

My mom gave me her bread machine, and this was the first recipe I ever used in it. This was easy, used ingredients I already had on hand, and was delicious. I have made it a few times now, and use it for sandwiches. I will NOT buy bread from the store anymore, not with a great recipe in hand!

this bread really rocks! i ate almost half a loaf when it came out of the oven. the only thing i added was some dough enhancer you can buy from www.kitchenresource.com it works like gluten, but preserves your homemade bread longer and really enhances it. the texture is better and doesn't crumble when you slice it. this batch i ran out of flax seed so i used flax seed meal so we'll see how it turns out. i like to add sunflower seeds too. this recipe is pretty versatile as far as seeds. i make in bread machine, starting with warm water, yeast and honey and let the yeast come to life b4 adding the flour.

Really really good.  To be honest, when it was mixing I didn't think I would like it-thought it would be too crunchy/seedy and it smelled too strong-but it was absolutely delicious!  I used sunflower, flax, & sesame seeds and used bread machine to mix, let rise in loaf pan and baked in my oven at 340 for 28 mins (my oven runs hot though).  Perfect.  Made the BEST toast the next morning too!  Thanks-a new favorite!

This bread is sinful!!! I am new to baking bread - in both a machine and conventional. I changed a few things - added some wheatgerm - extra salt - extra yeast - abit more water. I also eyeballed the measuring of the honey and oil (used olive). Anyway, this bread recipe will be used at least 3 times a week - maybe 5!!!

Delicious.  The crust came wonderfully crispy while the inside was soft and tender.  I only had sesame seeds and poppy seeds on hand, which really gave the bread another level of flavor that wasn't overpowering but much more interesting than plain!  Also, I had to sub light corn syrup for the honey, which seemed to work just fine.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was good and came out great even with adjustments.  I didn't have any wheat flour so I used all purpose in place of it.  My bread machine also doesn't have a setting for making a 1 lb loaf so I set it on the 1.5 lb and "light" settings and it came out perfect.  I'm planning to make it with wheat flour this week!

This is a wonderful recipe and it came out perfectly.  I can't say enough good things about it! I put the bread machine on and then made the soup to go with it for dinner and my husband and I polished off more than half the loaf.  I will make this again and again and will probably "fiddle" with the recipe a bit, by changing the seeds as there are so many out there.  Update: Shelled sunflower seeds add a lovely nuttiness to this bread and may be my favourite variation with equal amounts of subflower seeds, poppy seeds and flax seeds.

I like making bread the old fashioned way...by hand and bake it in my oven so that's what I did with this.  It's pretty good tasting, however, it didn't rise very high.

A delicious hearty bread. Everyone loved it. Have made it twice and it came out great both times, following recipe exactly. Didn't toast the seeds the second time (mistake), but we toasted the bread for breakfast and it brought out the flavor of the seeds. Will make this bread again and again.

I have made several breads from this site both in the breadmaker and by hand. This easily makes my top 3. I didn't have any poppyseeds so used sunflower seeds instead. The crust on this tastes just like the crust on the bread my mother used to buy from our local bakers when I was growing up. No bread has ever matched it until now. Many Thanks.

I LOVE this bread!  It is so nice and light, unlike many of the wheat breads I have made.  I used one cup bread flour and one cup whole wheat floor, and I used a handful of crushed pecans along with the seeds.  Fabulous.

This is a good seed bread, but I think the sesame seed flavor was a bit strong.  I increased the wheat so that it was half wheat and half white.  Overall a good bread.

This is a great bread. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so just used unbleached regular instead. Followed other suggestions and substituted sunflower seeds for poppy(personal preference). Used a coffee blade grinder to grind flax seed and it worked great. Bread is great as is, and if you can wait a day the honey flavor improves with time.

Okay, THIS is the bread I have been waiting for.  I love bread that is nutty and seedy, and living in Guatemala it is almost impossible to find it, except in commercial sliced bread.  I bake a lot of bread and am constantly on the lookout for various seeds, and just happened to have all these on hand.  I toasted mine on the stovetop in a frypan using low heat and stirring frequently until I could smell the toasty goodness, let them cool and dumped them in.  I think I will be making this a lot, so will just toast a couple pounds of them and keep them in my freezer to use as needed.  Thank you so much for this bread recipe.

Delicious! Toasted the seeds in the microwave, which is fast and easy. Start with 1 minute, then in 30 second increments until seeds are fragrant. Also added 2 tbsp of honey. Baked at 375F in a heated Dutch oven for a rustic crunchy crust.

I used black sesame seeds, as that's all I had...I did grind up 1/2 of the flax seed (as I like the whole ones too) and added 2 tbl of toasted sunflower seed, as it's hard for me to make bread without them! LOL...Very good, will make this one again!!!

This is a super simple and delicious bread. I did toast my seeds. I excluded the poppy seeds and threw in a handful of sunflower seeds. The bread turned out very attractive despite being a bread machine bread.  It had a nice crisp crust and soft moist inside. I had two slices right out of the pan.

Bread had a nice texture but I wasn't very fond of the flavor.  That's probably due to the fact that I didn't have flax seed so subbed sunflower seeds.  Will try it with flax seed before I give up on it.
