This is a great base recipe, but I did do a few things differently. I first salted each piece of eggplant, let it sit for 30 minutes, drained and then rinsed each piece with water. This allows it to lose a lot of moisture so that the roasting gives it a very nice texture and consistency. Then I added basil, oregano and garlic powder to spice it up so that I can serve this with pasta and sauce. It is a delightful alternative to eggplant parm, and a lot healthier!

1. This is a very good basic recipe for roasted eggplant, and you can pretty much change the seasonings at will to match whatever you may wish to eat the eggplant with. I've tended to leave it at salt, pepper, and basil and it comes out terrific every time.    2. As other reviewers have mentioned, salting the eggplant first and then letting it sit to drain is a *must* for this recipe. Not only does it take out some of the moisture to improve the texture for roasting, but it also cuts the bitterness of the eggplant. I've tried it both ways; salting, draining, rinsing, and drying the eggplant beforehand gives a *much* tastier and better textured end product.    3. When you roast the eggplant at this temp/time, the cut surfaces get nice and crispy and the insides turn beautifully tender. If you like the crispy outer texture that roasted vegetables can sometimes get, cut the eggplant into smaller pieces (say, eighths instead of the quarters it calls for in the recipe) to maximize the surface area.

I agree this is a good base recipe. I added more olive oil, to which I stirred in a large amount of minced garlic. I also added dried basil to the salt and pepper. My husband loves eggplant and he loved this.

I sliced the eggplant diagonally and sprinkled both sides of the slices with salt and let them sweat for about 1/2 an hour. I then rinsed them and put them between paper towels. I lined a cookie sheet with foil and sprayed with Pam, placed the eggplant slices on and brushed with a mix of olive oil and crushed garlic and sprinkled with salt & pepper. I think the sweating part makes a huge difference. The outside of the eggplant was crispy and browned while the inside was tender. Very simple and healthy recipe. Will make again!

This was really tasty. I added minced garlic, dried thyme and basil, plus some pepper and salt to the olive oil before brushing it on. Roasting brought out the natural sweetness of the eggplant. Really delicious - my 10 month old loved it, too!

This was pretty good. Nice healthy way to have eggplant. I also let the eggplant sit in salt for while, I find it's the only way eggplant cooks well. I added garlic powder and some dried cilantro to them when baking and then dumped half a lemon's juice on them when I removed from oven. Yum! Thanks to whoever posted this!

Easy breezy and so delicious!  I just followed the recipe and it came out just fine.  I did add whole peeled garlic cloves in the pan and served this with thin spagettini, artichoke hearts and jarred roasted peppers, tossed with a tad of light olive oil.  A nice healthy meal, quick, easy and tasty!  One thing to remember is to bake this in glass ovenware such as pyrex, never aluminum.  Also when slicing the eggplant, use only stainless steel knife.  Anything metal will ruin the flavor. Bon appetit!

This is a very basic but solid recipe.  Good for a night when you don't feel like putting in too much effort in the kitchen but want something healthy.

I chopped the eggplant into smaller bit sized pieces and sprinked them with salt. I then let the pieces in a strainer to drian for about 30 mins...then rinsed and pressed with paper towels. I mixed them in a bowl with enough olive oil just to coat then placed on lightly oiled aluminium foiled pan. Sprinlked salt pepper onion powder garlic powder and smoked paprika. Bake until goldn brown and squeeze fresh lemon juice. Yummy!

You can also use Extra Light Olive Oil instead of Extra Virgin Olive Oil for a lighter olive oil taste to it. Also if you want a little kick to it you can add red pepper flakes before putting in the oven.

I really liked this very simple recipe.  It is nothing extravagant, but it is very good.  I elected not to use any pepper.  Easy to prepare, an excellent side dish!

This is very nice.  the cooking method is easy and results in a flavorful, soft eggplant.  I don't, however, like the lemon juice at the end.  I don't like the combination of flavors or the fact that the lemon juice seems to cool down the eggplant, so I think I'll try lemon pepper instead of lemon juice and pepper next time.  I sweated the eggplant--salted, let sit in a colander for an hour, then rinsed and drained thoroughly.  I definitely like this, minus the lemon juice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for more eggplant recipes since we were getting it frequently with our farm share. I made this recipe exactly according to the directions. The taste was bland and the texture unappealing.

I just loved this and Hubs, who generally turns his nose up at eggplant, even found it "edible." Simple preparation with just a few ingredients and it worked perfectly paired with oven roasted potatoes which required the same roasting time and temperature.  I used baby Italian eggplant which made this especially tender and sweet.  It costs a little more, but it's worth it.

I salted the eggplant for about 1/2 hour then drained.  Then brushed on the olive oil, salt, pepper and some basil.  Delish!!  I didn't even use lemon.

This was a great recipe to use fresh summer eggplant for. I cut eggplant into smaller pieces before baking. I added it to couscous when finished and I whisked together lemon juice and olive oil for a dressing over the combination. Delicious!

Very easy and delicious. I did what some others recommended; let the eggplant sit and added other spices. Then when it was 3/4 done cooking, I transferred it to a long glass baking pan and layered sauce and cheese and baked. I will make this again!

Great starter recipe. Took the advice of some of the top "helpers" and sprinkled salt on the eggplant cubes beforehand. It wasn't bitter at all due to that step! I also sprinkled basil, oregano, and panko crumbs.

Another vegetable I never thought of roasting, until someone posts a simple recipe like this.  I added a little garlic powder while it roasted and I served open face on homemade bread with feta cheese on top.  We loved it.  Thanks Sandra, great recipe.

Followed some of the suggestions: salted for 30 minutes, and added basil. Was delicious. Will make again and again. Very healthy and tasty, and appreciated by the husband.

This came out amazing.  I cut the eggplant in the manner recommended, then I put it all in a large bowl, drizzled olive oil over the eggplant, added sea salt, black pepper, fresh parsley, cilantro, dill, and tossed it by hand in the bowl, then let all the herbs and spices soak in for a few minutes as the oven heated.  Placed the pieces on the parchment paper as directed, roasted according to temp and time listed here, and voila!  I forgot the lemon at the end, but with all the other herbs I added, it was plenty flavorful.  

My kids and I loved it, and even my husband, who swore off eggplant forever 23 years ago after having it served to him literally twice a day for two months at a summer camp job in college, said it was really good and had some. ;)  Thanks for a VERY easy and DELICIOUS recipe.

Sometimes the simplest seasonings can make an awesome difference in a side dish such as eggplant. In this case just olive oil, salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice is all that it took to make this a 5 stars in my opinion. I loved the tender roasted eggplants seasoned lightly and just a tad of lemon juice. I served this with, “Mushroom Slow Cooker Roast Beef,” and “Swanson Ultimate Mashed Potatoes,” also from this website.

This recipe turned out awesome! I did everything exactly as in the recipe except instead of using olive oil I just sprayed the eggplants with PAM cooking spray and that did the trick.

This recipe was EXCELLENT and extremely easy!  And eggplant, in weight watchers, is 0 points...so very healthy!  I actually used lemon pepper in lieu off fresh lemon and it was even easier!

I tried this recipe today and I was so diappointed. It came out very salty, totally inedible! I followed other commenters advice to put salt on eggplant and sweat it for 30 mins. I rinsed it and then it still absorbed the salt. It still came out a bit mushy, not crispy... I would welcome ideas what to do different next time.

This was perfect. I made it with some foot-long Japanese eggplants out of my garden, cut into slivers. I let it sweat for 30 minutes, and then drained it. While the oven was heating up, I tossed in salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and the olive oil. I let these soak in for ten minutes. I cooked it for the time and at the temperature suggested here. It came out beautifully. I served it on some fresh-baked ciabatta, with feta cheese and some marinara sauce. My three brothers, sister, parents, and boyfriend all had seconds and scolded me for not making more. I will make this again and again and again. Thank you so much!

I loved this! I really didn't know what to expect, I have never purchased an eggplant  before, and I don't really cook, so... I wasn't expecting much. But I loved it and will be making it more often!

I needed to use up an eggplant, and this worked fine since I had all the ingredients. I did let the eggplant sit with salt on it and then rinse and dry before brushing with olive oil and sprinkling garlic, thyme, salt and pepper over the slices on the baking sheet. Baked for 30 minutes, then sprinkled with the lemon juice and it was a satisfying lunch - although the eggplant itself doesn't have much flavor.

Great quick simple recipe. As other users suggested I salted the eggplant after slicing and let it drain for about a half hour before roasting. This will keep the eggplant from getting mushy, I added garlic powder for flavor and was pleased with the result. It makes a great quick side dish or even a yummy crunchy snack!

I made this with a few japanese eggplants I had left in the fridge. I used lemon pepper and an oil olive spray and baked for 20 min. They make out better then I expected and I WILL DEFINITELY make this again. Easy and very tasty.

Good. My roommate had two servings, even though he does not like eggplant. I thought it needed something more. I took advice and slathered some pasta sauce and parmesan on top. Yum

Sorry, this just didn't work for me - maybe I did something wrong but we did not enjoy the flavor and they came out crunchy on the outside and soggy on the inside.

This was great, I used Pam spray instead of the olive oil and Mrs. Dash instead of salt and pepper.

This is amazing and so delicious!  I decided to add a Thai spice blend to the olive oil (I eyeballed the amount) before brushing it on the eggplant for extra zip.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it is to die for, thanks so much Sandra!!

I am a recently turned vegan who is on the hunt for tasty new recipes. This dish was perfect! I made it with some vegan pasta noodle drizzled in olive oil, onion, garlic and cherry tomatos. Thank you for reminding me that I do not need meat or dairy to make a fantasic meal!

very good. I brushed both sides with olive oil, pepper both sides, salted one side and cooked the salt side up. Then 20 minutes in. I flipped it up to side without salt and used Parmesan cheese on top (the parmesan I have is very salty). It was delicious. next time I will try no salt at all and just a small mound of Parmesan cheese on top. the last 5 minutes put it on broil so the cheese gets crispy.

My grill was out of gas so at the last minute I sliced my eggplan, spread with olive oil, salted as suuggested and sprinkled with Montreal Chicken seasoning which is always great on veggies too - roasted on 400 for 20 mi as suggested - and YUM! Served with fresh beefsteak tomatoes sliced with balsamic and goat cheese. Simple and delicious!

I salted and drained as suggested and it was tasty, it's a good basic recipe, as has been noted, it seems to me it would be easy to vary it - it would mix well with other veggies too, like soy beans.

A little soggy even after salting the eggplant for 30 minutes. However, we added some garlic and balsamic vinegar and the eggplant tasted wonderful.

Perhaps I am not an eggplant fan or got a bad one.  Won't try eggplant again unless it is smothered in something that can take away the flavor.  This recipe doesn't do it.

A simple, easy very tasty recipe.  Yes, definitely salt, rinse and pat dry first.  I added a few cloves of garlic, salt and pepper to the oil and then brushed on. The skin is chewy and the flesh creamy.  Tasted fantastic with lamb curry.  Will definitely make again

This was a not bad recipe.  I am not a huge eggplant fan though.  My husband really liked it!  I took the advice of others here and salted it and let it sit for 30 minutes.  It did help with the moisture.

Yum, roasted veggies carmelized in their own juices.  I included eggplant and asparagus too!  Forgot the lemon, maybe on the leftovers, and it was delicious anyway.

A new VEGAN EGGPLANT  RECIPE. This was super easy to make and a way to save an eggplant I didn’t know what do with. This will be a go to recipe. I like things extra lemony so I used my manual lemon press and squeezed more juice on them while hot. I made a salad and added this to it with lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, cucumbers, basil flakes and calamata olives and drizzled a little olive oil, tossed and added salt and pepper to taste and a little more lemon juice. Thanks Sandra!

I had an eggplant I needed to use, and wanted to do something other than fry it  or make ratatouille , so I searched, and found this recipe. I'm so glad I did! It is awesome! I added the garlic and basil per the video, and they really should be included in the base recipe. I also salted, drained, rinsed, and dried the eggplant first. This will now be one of my go to recipes for eggplant. Do yourself a favor and try this! I'm going to try some to make babaganoush!

Watch the video to make this recipe, it is a big help.  Although it is an easy recipe, salting, washing, and drying the eggplant is time consuming. I also added the garlic and basil. I tried some pieces with lemon juice but prefer the eggplant without it.

Wife approved!  I made it for my wife and she gave it a 5 stars. She loved it. She ate it before I could put the lemon juice on so I took it and put lemon juice on it . She said I liked it without the lemon juice... But at the end she liked it either way.

I followed the directions exactly, but didn't put lemon juice on it and I thought it still tasted wonderful.  I think it's a really good alternative to potatoes.

Very good.  A couple of things were done differently.  I salted the pieces and let them sweat 30 minutes and then rinsed and dried them.  I placed the oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper in a plastic bag then added the eggplant to coat. I then placed them skin side down on the baking sheet and continued as directed.

It's more than 3 stars if you sea salt the eggplant first and leave it 30 minutes then squeeze them out! We preferred ours without lemon juice like another reviewer. I just cut the eggplant into big chunks and we ate it over quinoa pasta which was very delicious.

This was simple and healthy, but not very lemony. I think next time I would put the lemon juice on before baking, so it can better absorb into the eggplant.

I had never tried eggplant until I made this, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I made half of the batch exactly as the directions stated and added garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and shredded parmesan to the rest.  I think it tasted great both ways.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Eh. I've never made eggplant and not sure if I will prepared like this again. The taste was kind of blah but I just think that's how it is, eggplant. I think I like it better with cheese and sauce lol. :)

I found this recipe to be not very good at all.  The taste of the olive oil was overpowering and it just wasn't the right flavor for the eggplant.

I agree this is a good basic recipe. I go about it a bit differently, though. I cut into pieces as fits my recipe or dinner meal. Sometimes rounds, sometimes chunks. I like the chunks for ease of prep better. I put oil, acid (vinegar or lemon/lime juice) a bit of salt and spice to fit y my meal in a large salad bowl. Then throw in the chunks and toss until well coated. I find this more completely coats the prices, requires less oil--eggplant drinks it up.   Place the pieces on the pan to roast. Then I use the same bowl to make my salad dressing in, adding more  dressing ingredients and then salad ingredients. then the salad dressing compliments the eggplant.  And I only dirty one bowl.  Works for all roasted veggies, and I do this about 3 times per week with whatever veggies I have on hand.

Simple and delicious.  Eggplant is probably my favourite Veggie.  I did it in rounds and threw grated parmesan on it and served it warm right out of the oven . 

I much prefer to have eggplant retain some crunchiness  in most of my recipes for this veggie.  I did that with this recipe and it worked out well.  Guests loved it

This is superb with all the wonderful flavors, crispness on the edges and yummy softer center on the peel. It is a delight! I cut my wedges thinner, added extra spices (onion powder, parsley, garlic powder), along with the minced garlic, Himalayan sea salt and pepper. Baked 30 minutes. I’m planning to make this a new side dish for Thanksgiving!

I substituted the olive oil with sunflower oil and used sea salt. Immediately after removing the eggplant from the oven, I drizzled with concentrated lemon juice.  I will most definitely make again. Easy and tasty.

As many suggested, after slicing I liberally sprinkled salt on the eggplant and let it sit to remove moisture and bitterness, then pat dry with paper towel.  After sprinkling with oil, I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  The lemon at the end is the secret to success!!

Not bad. Salted the eggplant for 1/2 hour and made according to recipe.I thought the lemon juice was a bit overpowering. Will make again but will cut the lemon and maybe add some herbs to pump up the flavor.

I loved it, although next time I’ll use a bit more salt, as my Italian husband said it was a tiny bit bitter. (I didn’t taste bitterness) 
I sat 1/2 aside & sprinkled mozzarella on top and put them back in the oven for a bit, then broiled till cheese was golden! Served with marinara! Fabulous! (I will for sure make this again cutting eggplant into circles like mini egglplant pizzas w/ sauce on side)

Delicious and really easy!  I've made it as an entree and a side - if you want to kick it up a notch add some lemon zest, mince garlic and italian seasoning to the olive oil before you brush it on and then top with feta cheese

This recipe is close to how I roast eggplant to make eggplant Parmesan, minus the lemon juice. But I always  salt  the slices of eggplant and let them render some of their bitter juice, then rinse a pat dry with paper towels before roasting. But I never thought of making the eggplant this way to eat as is !! 
The mistake I made with this recipe though,  was to use Chinese eggplant ! Don't use that kind ! It's tenderer and It doesn't stand up to the high heat and all that roasting time.. They turned mushy.
I will make again with other kind of eggplants and maybe add some garlic powder too. But, I won't be using the lemon juice, I just didn't like it on eggplant..

i made this for the first time.Not first time making it but having it. I had no idea what it was going to taste like but it was delicious.I was sad to have never tried it then.All the years of my life had past and I had waited until I was 55 years old before I did.I followed instructions to the letter and took the prep very serious but it turned out very tasty to me.So tasty I have decided to  try it again with paraghamian  next time.I have moved up in my taste bud and now I want to go a bit further

Mine did not come out crispy. I think I need to increase the temperature on my oven. It was delicious. I set the eggplant in a bowl with salt for 30 minutes. I washed the salt off and dried the eggplant. Then  I added olive oil, lemon pepper, salt and more pepper. I added a five cheese blend of Italian cheeses two minutes before the time ended. It added that extra something!

I made this exactly as written and aside from my 1 year old no one else in my family would eat it. The texture of the eggplant was strange especially with the skin on. The skin was rubbery & tough while the eggplant was mush. The flavors were just not appealing in the end. I really wanted to love this recipe since we have a garden full of eggplant.

I  was glad I read some of the reviews. I thought this was a phenomenal base recipe. I usually don't care for people rating a recipe and then changing it, but I followed all the directions as written but added additional herbs and garlic to taste. I roasted some summer squash, zucchini, and onion and served it with some whole wheat pasta and marinara. It was the perfect yummy and healthy lunch on a rainy day. Thanks!!

I really like the mushy texture of eggplant - just like scrambled eggs!  The roasting adds a bit more texture, caramelized a bit, nice.  I forgot the lemon, but it was very good with the beef roast with gravy that I made with it.  I think I will peel the eggplant next time.  Thanks for posting.

We love eggplant and this recipe didn't disappoint. However, the submitter left out a major step. Eggplant is bitter if not salted and left for 30 minutes. I go one step further, I salt the eggplant and place it between layers of paper towels then place a heavy pot on top. After 30 minutes I rinsed, dried and proceeded with the instructions. To make cleanup easier, I cooked this on parchment paper. I like to make a recipe as close to written as possible the first time but in future I'll add additional seasonings and garlic.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious and I would make it again.  I seasoned with Mrs. Dash and ground pepper and left out the salt.  We had fresh lemons right from our tree to squeeze on them.  Savory to the max!!!

Make sure you first salt for 1/2 hour, rinse, then follow recipe, adding basil for the roasting, then the rest when done.

First time I've preparred Eggplant.  I cut into 1/8s instead of 1/4s and drained for 30 minutes as suggested by review  Seasoned with basil, salt and pepper.  Next time I will cook an extra 10 minutes for more crispy outside.  I think I would add a bit of garlic as well.

Great recipe! I add some garlic powder (and salt the eggplant prior to get rid of any bitterness), but otherwise stay true to the recipe.

It's in the oven right now. I did the salt and rinse before proceeding, but how can you place it skin-side down when it has been sliced as instructed? Still, it's an appealing and simple way to cook eggplant and I look forward to digging in ! (If I'm disappointed, will come back and say so, but I'm an optimistic cook!) I see that I mixed the recipe, which seems to show slices across rather than along its length. Delicious result though!

WAS a great recipe when I cut it thinner and into patties :|... Don't much like the cutting directions you give here. Rather than cutting down the length just cut it the short way. It'll cook all the way through.

I didn't like this one. It turned out overly spiced.

This was pretty tasty!  It was my first eggplant experience, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but the eggplant came out tender and the flavors were good.  I'll make this again, especially when I'm feeling lazy but want to feel like I ate a healthy dinner.
