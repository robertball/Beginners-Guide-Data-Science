I doubled everything except for the potatoes (boiled until almost tender) added fresh green beans & cooked another 5 minutes.  I didn't use the olives, used a large chopped onion & apple cider vinegar, everything else the same except double.  Will make again.

This was a great potato salad for taking to a picnic; there was no mayo but it tasted quite creamy.  My husband hates onion pieces so I used a teaspoon of Onion Powder instead of the chopped onion.  I think the key to flavorful potatoes is to dress them while they are still hot.  I cooked the green beans separately and then shocked them in ice water so they would stay firm.  Raves from the whole family.

This was a great potato salad recipe.  My husband doesn't like the traditional mayo-based potato salads, so this was great!  The only change I would make is doubling the amount of green beans.  There weren't very many at all.  A great light side-dish to a summer barbeque!

I loved it put of course AL didn't like that is why I rated it low. The combination of Oil/white wine vinegar/dill/dry mustard was good.  Probably good with pasta too

This was a good salad, but not quite enough flavor "kick" for me. I think I would use lots of fresh dill next time, and green olives instead of black olives. I enjoyed the method of cooking the green beans in the same pot as the potatoes, though, which made it very easy. I didn't have any ground mustard, so I used dijon mustard, and it turned out fine. This is great for a picnic since there is no mayo.

This was delicious! I used 2 bags of frozen 16 oz green beans and 1/2 cup olive oil. It was a huge hit even with a friend who didn't like potato salad.

4.5 stars  I really liked this for the variety and the different flavors it brings out.  It's easy and quick to make (just have large bowl!) and kept pretty well for our outdoor activities.  I'll make again.  Everyone enjoyed something different.
