Can I give this 6 stars? What a great refreshing light dish. We even added imitation crabs to a few rolls at the end. We served with sushi ginger, peanuts, and wasabi! I would reduce the vinegar by a 1/2 Tbsp next time I make the dip.

Super easy and absolutely delicious! We made the dip as stated and although we didn't find it too vinegary, I did notice as we added the cilantro at the end as noted, ours was decidely more green then other pictures. It was delicious, none the less, and we also substituted chicken for the avocado. Will make again!

We loved it so much that I made this twice. The second time I added baby shrimp and sesame seeds. Both times were delicious. I did cut the vinegar down as it seemed like a bit too much when I made it the first time. I will make these again now that I know how easy and delicious they are. Possibilities are endless. Good way to use up fresh veggies, too.

This dish reminded me of the mango sushi and the veggie rolls combined! (Which is a good thing by the way)
