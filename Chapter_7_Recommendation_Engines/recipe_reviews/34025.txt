Tried this and it never set.  I added more powdered sugar to try and get it the correct consistency to no avail.  I kneaded this stuff for over 1/2 hour...I don't know enough about marzipan to know what else to try, but this will not work for decorations that you need to be solid!  It is a gooey mess.

I inadvertently used almond meal instead of 'paste' and the recipe turned out perfectly. I added maybe a quarter cup extra of powdered sugar to get it to the kneadable point.

Tried this recipe yesterday. It turned out like a semi-liquid paste rather than a dough. ANy idea why it could have gone wrong?

Hey there,   I as well, (without reading these reviews) tried this out. It was my first marzipan recipe I ever tried, so it was a disappointment to find out it did not work.. but, there is a good thing! I made a few adjustments to make the recipe how marzipan should be. To do this, I added one 198g container of Jet Puffed Marshmallow fluff and a few more cups of icing sugar. I kneaded it only a few times and it ended up turning out very well.   I hope you can do the same and have your marzipan to turn out too. The consistancy should be simular to pie dough, Good Luck! :)

I was going to try this recipe, but almond paste is too soft, and once mixed with egg whites, it's just a mess.  Most of the other recipes I've found call for finely ground blanched almonds--probably b/c of the dryness?  Hopefully, this helps...

I have made this and use regular sugar works great, just leave it overnight in the fridge, and use almond flour or ground almond.

I'm not sure what the others did or didn't do when making this recipe.  It turned out exactly like it was suppose to for me, and I followed the recipe to a tee.  The only thing I did was convert the 3 cups confection sugar to ounces and then weighed the sugar. In addition, I used my paddle hook on my KitchenAide mixer to knead the dough. As to the recipe being to soft or not setting... that is either a not enough dry ingredient or too much wet. This recipe doesn't say what size egg to use for the egg whites.  The larger the eggs the more white, so maybe the eggs need to be just large or medium in size.
