I tried it because of the short list of ingredients and relative ease. I was actually in tears after dishing this out to my family. No one could eat it. Negative 100 stars.

The top did not turn out. To save the apples i had to peel off the old top layer and recreate another topping. My advice, try a different apple crisp recipe.

I tried this recipe and it did not turn out.  Maybe a step is missing or something else is mixed up.

I just have a suggestion... dont use macintosh apples, they are waaayy to soft for cooknig/ baking with.  The best that I have used are Ida Red or golden delicious.  Mac's are good for eating, but for baking they get really mushy.

This recipe had no flavor and the topping was pasty.  I'm so glad I was just playing in the kitchen when I made this and not taking it to work to share.

This recipe is okay but I changed it to make it better. For the topping, I added more brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and nutmug. How can an apple crisp recipe not have cinnamon? And you only need to bake the apples 20 minutes, add the topping and bake for another 40 minutes. That is plenty of time. It came out really good with my changes to it!

This recipe is missing the BUTTER! I have not tried it but after reading the reviews I looked at the ingredients. I am sure it was quite dry. Also, I would say definitely eliminate the milk. Thats just weird. It will sour.

i think there's a misprint here. Shouldn't that 3/4 cup be BUTTER instead of milk? I chanllenge anyone who hates this recipe to exchange the milk for melted butter and see how it comes out then.

This came out great doubled.  BUT...I only added 1 egg to a doubled recipe instead of two, and I added 6 tsp. of melted butter instead of four.  We put it in a 13 x 9 pan, baked it at 350 for 30 min.  Delish!

Tried this as we like apple crisp a lot but had to add a lot of ingredients to make it worth eating.  Somebody must have left a lot of things out when they entered the recipe here. This is terrible as written.

I used a combination of Rice Milk, H2O, and whipped cream, instead of just milk, using a base of Arrowhead Mill's Organic Buttermilk Pancake Mix (rather than flour).  Because I am cooking for 2, I cut all ingredients down to about a 1/3 of original qty.  While I usually use some form of butter (usually Smart Balance spread w/ flax seed oil), I specifically searched for a recipe that did NOT include any type of butter in the topping.  Like one suggestion, I mixed all ingredients together at the start, and will top with just a few sprinkles of the buttermilk mix and a few oats towards the last 15 min. of baking time for a crispy topping.  I am rating based on my modifications for adding organic ingredients + mixing altogether.

I put in a cup of melted butter instead of the milk. Added a tablespoon of cinnamon. 
I also used Courtland apple's.
