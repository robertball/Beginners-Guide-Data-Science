Very good, but I would leave off the gravy and add salsa.

I wanted to do something different for breakfast, so I tried these. They were pretty good, but seemed to be missing a little something - maybe sauteed onions and green peppers would be good. I used the "mexican mix" cheese (all I had) and that gave it a little kick.  Also, the sausage gravy my mom makes is a lot tastier than this one. Hubby liked it okay. Alright for basic recipe. Will probably make again, but will tweak a little bit to suit our tastes.

These are terrific!  I added a bit of cumin and Chipotle pepper powder to the egg mixture, and some Tabasco to the gravy (we really like spicy stuff!) -- wow!  I'm going to try this with bacon tomorrow, cooking it in the same fashion as the sausage.  Great recipe..thanks!!

My family loved these.  I was looking for a recipe I could roll up in foil and throw on the grill for our camping trip.  I just put the gravy in the egg mixture instead of on the outside.  Everyone loved them, and they were perfect for the camping trip.  My 7 year old said, "I could eat these all day long"!  I added some butter to the drippings to make a little extra gravy.

Very good, but will alter a bit next time to better fit our tastes.  My husband loved all of the sausage, but it was a little to much for me.  Next time I will halve the sausage, add a few more eggs, and double the gravy.  I halved the recipe and it made 5 (w/6 in. tortillas) burritos and fit perfectly in an 11x7 pan.

I cut the ingredients for the filling in half but kept the gravy the same amounts. I did spice up the gravy with onion powder, garlic powder, a little hot sauce, and some fresh ground pepper. I did not eat any of these but my three men ate every bite of breakfast. They thought the gravy inside the breakfast burritos was an excellent idea.

Yum, yum, yum!  Had these right before the Vikings game and they were delicious!  Made extra gravy with 1 cup water, 1 beef bouillon cube & 1 teaspoon flour.  Other than that, don't change a thing!  A great brunch, we'll certainly be having these again.

We loved these.  Used green pepper in place of the chiles and mild italian sausage in place of pork sausage. Turned out great for us.  Thanks so much for the post.

Breakfast burritos never register any complaints from my fiance! I scaled this back to 1 serving. Used 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites (I always do that) and added a splash of milk to the eggs. I did use sausage links, as that what I had on hand. I also skipped the gravy, as it didn't seem necessary. Thanks :)

This is really good greasy breakast food. I think it would be perfect for a brunch. I'm not a huge egg fan but I love these! I used 1 lb of spicy sausage, and also added a diced green bell pepper. Instead of making the gravy I garnished with sour cream, salsa and a dash of hot sauce.Very tasty indeed I'll be making theese again for sure!!

I cut this down to only 4 servings, and omitted the green chiles per my kids' request.  I also used turkey sausage links.  My kids loved these for breakfast and have already asked when they can have them again.

I made this for a work breakfast!  Everyone raved about it!    Needs more of the white sauce for my taste.  Next time I will double the sauce.  Also, I made my own sausage instead of store bought.

These were good and fairly easy.  I halved the recipe for the burritos but still made the same amount of gravy.  I feel like it could have used even more!  We did use a roux in the gravy, to help thicken it up, so that could have had something to do with it not being enough.  Delicious, nonetheless!

I think this recipe is between 3 and 4 stars.  The gravy wasn't enough and I added a pakage of gravy mix that I made to it.  Also, I used half the sausage it called for and it was plenty.  I think it wasn't really worth the trouble, I like just to put all the ingredients you like  in a warm tortilla and add salsa ontop... it's much easier!

We weren't crazy about this.  I forgot to save the sausage drippings so I made packaged peppered sausage gravy and put on top.  All in all it was okay. I will maybe try again but use salsa or cheese on top next time.

I didn't like the cheese with gravy taste.  I like to make the tortilla part of this recipe, fold like Chimichangas and grill them, and then dip in salsa.  Adding sautéed onion is good also.

This was just ok. I wish there was more gravy.  Also, I should've put salsa inside the burrito-would've been less dry tasting.

Can't be completely fair with this rating, I left out the sausage, which means I didn't have any sausage drippings for the gravy to go on top of the burrito.  Instead I used some extra ham that I had, cut up, and they still turned out good with just the eggs, the green chili peppers, and lots of cheese.  After Rolling them up I baked them in the oven for about ten minutes to make the tortilla nice and crispy and to melt the cheese.  We served them with a little sour cream and salsa on top, and of course more cheese!  Turned out really good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Prepared this for the first time for my wife to take to a brunch meeting, she said it was a "hit" and she has one recipe request.  I didn't get to eat any, but there are some leftovers I can warm.  Very easy to prepare.

Delicious and perfect for a brunch. Made the extra gravy and also added onion and green pepper plus seasonings. I also used ready cooked pork sausage and just cut it up. Topped with a little extra cheddar.

I fix these for my husband and we though they were really good. The only changes I made was, I used hot sausage. I also used 2pkg. of McCormick Country Gravy,(sausage flavor)with a little sausage add to it,for the Gravy. Will differently make again. Thanks

Left out the peppers and added tomatoes.  Melted cheese on top instead of the gravy.  Quick and gratifying.

My breakfast-burrito-loving-kids both raved about this--so did I!  I didn't have enough drippings for a substantial amount of gravy--possibly because I used two packages of bulk sausage--and it comes in 12 oz packages--rather than the two pounds the recipe calls for.  Even so, good recipe-- and as other reviews stated--you could just have the burritos on their own--no need for the gravy.

Another hit at my brunch!  However, the gravy did not make enough to cover the burritos so they were a little dry on the outside but made no difference.  In the future, I would make more gravy on my own to make them a little more moist.  Great leftovers!!!

Made the recipe exactly as written but halved the recipe.  This was good but needed spices.  We ended up adding salsa to the top of our burritos just to give it more flavor.  This is a good base recipe.

This is a good base recipe but left me feeling quite heavy. It also needed a bit more texture. How would I alleviate these two issues? 1. Exclude gravy. I think that's what made it heavy. Salsa, cheese, or even plain with fixings after would be good. It would make them crispier. Sour cream would be an added bonus. 2. I would put onion and green/red peppers in the burritos.

This is a great brunch to feed a crowd.  I always add in a can of sliced mushrooms, and I use taco cheese and serve with a side of medium taco sauce!
