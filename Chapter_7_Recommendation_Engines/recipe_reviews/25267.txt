when cooking zucchini in a skillet, i always chop it up, then douse it with salt and let sit in a colander for 20-30 minutes before cooking...it gets rid of a lot of the water, staying somewhat firm while cooking.  i replaced the italian seasoning with cumin- so good!  *sigh* i love summer garden vegetable dishes! =)

This recipe was really easy.  My picky picky husband loved it.  I sauteed the garlic in with the onion instead of waiting.  I also added a spaghetti squash.  I used DelMonte Diced tomatoes with garlic, onion and olive oil instead of fresh tomato.  It worked well although I drained off the liquid before serving.  I added scallions when I added the tomatoes.  I didn't have "italian seasoning" but sprinkled with some parsley, oregano and basil.  Very easy and will add to the regular veggie rotation.

Loved it! Used valdalia onions and canned italian tomatoes & no mushrooms. Made this for inlaws last night for dinner with the best beef filets I have had in over 15 years. Mother in law said this veggie dish was even better than the beef!
Have made this several times since first review. I think it's best with a can or two of Italian style stewed tomatoes. Have made this with fresh, ripe tomatoes, but I couldn't duplicate the spices in the stewed tomatoes. Plus, it's much easier! 
Just made again. I also use a sprinkling of Mrs. Dash. I forgot to use some when I ate it last & it thought it was missing something. Remembered to use Mrs. Dash last night & it was MUCH better. Adds just a little kick.

We LOVED this recipe.  The only thing I will do differently next time, is to slice the onions instead of dicing them.  The diced pieces were too small to fit onto the fork, but tasted yummy just the same.

Outside of the Italian seasoning, this is the way I grew up eating zucchini and the way I still prepare it today.  I used a very nice Tuscan seasoning blend and sweet onion rather than red.  I don't know that it will change what is familiar and comfortable to me, but it was good! I mean, what's not to like with Italian seasoning?  :)

This is a great side dish.  I usually add some yellow summer squash for some color.  I bake it in the oven at 425 for about 45 minutes in glass baking dish sprayed with PAM vs. using olive oil.  I sprinkle it with some low fat parmesan cheese, a little lite butter, salt & pepper before serving.

I haven't served zucchini to my kids before so I was expecting them to balk when it was placed in front of them.  However, once I got them to actually put it in their mouths, they really liked it!  My husband loved it too.  I used some of the variations mentioned:  canned tomatoes w/ basil and garlic, garlic salt instead of salt, more crushed garlic, and sprinkled with parmesan.  I will be making this dish again.

This was a great basic recipe, but i changed it a bit. I made a much smaller amount (cooking for two) and used equal amounts zucchini, mushroom, and onion. I also used 3 large garlic cloves because we love garlic here and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Next time I will be leaving out the tomatoes. They just seemed to water down the flavour without adding anything interesting to the dish.

I halved the recipe and used half of a can of diced tomatoes in a garlic herb sauce instead of the tomato. I don't like mushrooms and used half of a red pepper instead. I wanted to use a yellow squash, but the ones at the store did not look good. The veggies were missing something, I think. Perhaps I did not add enough Italian seasoning.

Wow, this was a huge hit, healthy and super easy…even my 6 year old gobbled it up!  Instead of dicing a tomato I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with basil & garlic (drained) and I also added an extra clove or two of garlic.  I had to make a separate batch for my husband minus the mushrooms and he was mad that I didn’t make enough for him.  My aunt wouldn’t leave until she had a copy of the recipe.  This will definitely be added to the veggie rotation as they would be great with just about anything.  They worked perfectly with the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan from this site.

Denyse, this is crazy good!   I julianed the zucchini, I had no mushrooms but added double the red onion (as we love it) and chopped up an few kalamata olives, about a tablespoon of basalmic vinegar instead of the salad dressing.  garnished w/ grated parmesean.   WOW!!!

Everything in this recipe pointed to a potentially delicious dinner last night, but it was just average. Everyone liberally salted at the table, and no one thought this was a keeper.

Both my husband and myself really enjoyed this veggie dish.  I will definitely be making this again.  My only changes were:  I added 1 T. butter to the oil, I used a sweet onion because I did not have a red onion on hand, I had to use canned mushrooms, didn't have any fresh (shame on me), I used basil instead of italian seasoning and added one teaspoon sugar.  When it was doing cooking, I sprinkled it with parmesan cheese.  YUM!!!

I recently purchased a package of Ziploc Zip'nSteam bags. I had zucchini that I wanted to try out in the bag so I used this recipe. I was out of mushrooms but had everything else. I steamed all the ingredients in the bag for 4 minutes in the microwave and it turned out delicious and was super easy!

Instead of olive oil I cut everything up and marinated it in Italian dressing in a zip-lock. We were camping and stir fried it over the fire in a camp mesh screened pan. A very easy and tasty vegetable dish.

delicious and healthy. i substituted sliced black olives for the mushrooms, which i'm sure gave it a different taste than the original recipe, but it was still great. also didn't use salt and pepper, and i used halved grape tomatoes.

Loved this. I didn't want a heavy dinner, so I made this and put it on top of buttered penne noodles. Meatless dinner...and I didn't care! I didn't have a fresh tomato, so I put in around 1/3 cup of canned Itailian diced tomatoes. I added all the liquid from the can. Yummy!! I will make again. Next time I will make sure I have a fresh tomato...but if not, I know the canned tomatoes work just fine.

I loved this dish and thumbs up to the reviewer who suggested sprinkling salt on the veggies to squeeze out the moisture.  It made the dish.  I used both zucchini and yellow squash. Like some reviewers, I just used canned diced tomatoes with garlic and onion and OMG this will be my go to veggie dish from now on.  So easy and so good and makes a pretty presentation as well.  It's very low calorie, but I had to make myself stop eating it before I served it for dinner.  My husband LOVED it!

I've long been a fan of sauteing zucchini and yellow squash in butter, but this fancies it up a bit for company. :-) I didn't use as much onion as suggested b/c of a guest's sensitive stomach, but the flavor was really good.

Used 1/4 tsp each basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary since I didn't have Italian seasoning. Everyone loved it!

Good flavor! I used fresh herbs and sprinkled a bit of grated parmesan cheese before serving.

Excellent dish to use my ever producing Zucchini. I would suggest sauteing garlic with onion just prior to adding Zucchini.  Put tomato into boiling water for 1 minute to loosen skin before dicing. I made without mushrooms and was delicious, but would probably be extra special with mushrooms.

great recipe. I add shreadded cheese (cheddar, or parmesian, jack) whatever I have handy before serving. My kids love this with the melted cheese on top and don't think of it as a problem eating their veggies.

The first time I made this, my husband didn't like the Italian seasoning.  The second time, I substituted some onion powder for the Italian seasoning & it was a hit.  Sprinkling parmesan on top, as suggested by another reviewer, is tasty too.

Excellent!! I just loved it! I just started Atkins and was looking for something to add flare to some vegies and I FOUND THIS!! LOVE IT! I didn't have a tomato and I pressed the garlic instead. This is a keeper. Thanks Denyse

I was surprised how good this was. Made a few changes: increased tomato to match zucchini. Yellow onion instead of red. Added garlic with the onion. Left out mushrooms (but I'm sure they'd be great in this!). Added parmesan at the end and tossed in some pasta. DELISH!

I needed to use up some zucchini so I thought I would try this recipe. I wasn't sure how it would taste but it was delicious. I appreciate that it didn't have a sauce on it. Just the veggies. I followed the recipe except I had an orange pepper I had to use up as well. Thanks for this recipe. It will go into my keeper file.

great base recipe - left out the tomatoes so I could get some good browning on everything, added a chopped sweet pepper, some fresh lemon, and topped with parmesan. A local bistro near me serves this as a veggie type burger on a toasted crusty bun with melted gouda and mozz. - yum!

Very good! I did follow the recommendations that many others made and used canned italian tomatoes.  For the italian seasoning I did use the Mrs. Dash italian seasoning.  It was quick, easy and delicious!!

Great healthy side dish. Next time I'll try it with canned stewed tomatoes and see if that ups the flavor a bit, per other reviewers suggestions.

Good saute and easy to prepare.  I didn't have any mushrooms so I left those out and I ended up doubling the garlic.  I sprinkled some Parmesan cheese over the top.

Very yummy and versatile!  This is something I make often, switching up the veggies and seasonings depending on what we are having.  I used a greek seasoning to pair with Easy Mediterranean Fish which we were having (from AR of course!).  I used a combo of portabello and creminin mushrooms with the other veggies, colourful, healthy and fresh...love it!

I'm only giving this recipe four instead of five stars because of the modifications in amounts used. Here's what I used (made about 3 servings: 2 zucchini, 3 ripe small tomatoes, 2 medium vidalia onions, 2 cloves garlic, Italian seasonings, pepper, and 1.5 t white sugar. We served it over wheat spaghetti, and it was great! The tomatoes created a lot of extra juice, which is great if you're eating this over rice or pasta. This is a recipe that I will keep coming back to because of its versatility.

Great vegetable combination.  Giving four stars as written, because of inaccurate cooking time, in my opinion.  Also I would cut down the Italian seasoning to 1/2 tsp, because it overpowered the taste of the veggies. I would make again with adjustments.  Especially during summertime, when zucchini is plentiful.

Love fresh vegetable dishes.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh cause I didn't want to run to the store.  I am not crazy about the seasoning used in this recipe though, needs something more for my taste, more of a kick.

This recipe needed some tweaking for us.  I will try again adding a little butter and dry white wine and add the mushrooms near the end of cooking time so they don't get over cooked.

Very good. The mushrooms and tomatoes give it a great texture and flavor mix. I am not quite as sold on the way the Italian seasoning worked in it; I almost wanted a bit more of an Italian dressing taste, a bit more tang.

The recipe lacked a lot of instruction for those of us who don't know our way around the kitchen very well.  I didn't know what to do with the zucchini...do I peel it or leave the "skin" on.  Do I cut the zucchini lengthwise?  After overcoming those obstacles, I kicked up the seasoning a little and it was very good.

Nice change of pace vegetable will do often from now on.

This was really good.  I didn't add mushrooms, put the garlic in before the tomatoes, and put just oregano and thyme seasoning on it.  It was so tasty.  Loved it. I also used garlic salt and lemon pepper as an substitue for salt and pepper.

Cooked the garlic with the onions since I thought the taste would be overpowering if added just at the very end. This was so good, I know for sure, I will be making it again...and again!

Great recipe!  Zucchini and mushrooms are two of my favorite veggies and this recipe makes the most of them.  I added some chopped fresh basil and chopped fresh flat parsley as well as some dried oregano, and then cut back on the Italian seasoning (since I had added those other seasonings).  It came out really well and was really delicious.  This recipe is extremely easy and cooks up very quickly.  I’ve made this a couple of times now, including for company, and have received compliments and requests for the recipe.  This has become a new “go-to”.  I highly recommend it!

First, this makes a lot! Second, I took this to a potluck and got lots of compliments on and questions about it. I did make a couple of small changes, but think I stayed true to the nature of the recipe. I used both zucchini and yellow squash, a 14 1/2 oz. can of no salt diced tomatoes,  and increased the seasoning a little bit. In the summer when I have good fresh garden tomatoes, I will try it using them. For seasoning I used 1/2 tsp. of each salt and pepper, 1 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning, and 2 cloves of garlic. The spices had a solid flavor, but still left the dish light and fresh tasting. Thank you Denyse for sharing. I will use this recipe often as it will go with so many things and will be good year round.

A tasty and versatile recipe the family loved. Easily adaptable to particular tastes. Like others, I sliced the onions and cut in half rather than dice them, added carrot, and cut grape tomatoes in half. Very pretty and delicious! Also, great tip on salting the zucchini first and letting it sit in a colander for 30 minutes before cooking to make it less soggy!

Very simple yet tasty and fast recipe.  I didn't have an 'italian' seasoning, but subbing in a cajun seasoning and basil turned out great.

Love this simple saute.  It's a great side for just about anything from Italian to Mexican to BBQ.  I used as a side for our Cinco de Mayo dinner last night by adding a tablespoon of cumin to the mix.  I also added some sliced summer squash and shredded carrot.  Simple, versitle, delicious and quick, what more can you want!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe came out great.  I served the veggie mix in a serving dish tossed with whole wheat spaghetti.  I served spaghetti sauce on the side, to which I added sun-dried tomatoes.  My veggies consisted of zucchini, yellow squash, red pepper and vadalia onion.  The dish was seasoned with thyme, dill, oregano and basil.
And a light sprinkle of cayenne red pepper for zip.
I added about 3tsps of minced garlic. I left out the tomatoes (I didn't want the dish to be to watery). Be careful not to overcook the veggies.  I threw the zucchini and squash in last, and once they got soft I turned off the burner.
My husband liked this a lot.  Of course, he loaded it with parmagiana cheese! This version is garlicky and flavorful, can be served with or without spaghetti sauce.  It's a nice vegetarian option and would be great with Italian bread or rolls.

Delicious! Served it over pasta. I used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the one tomato and only used 2 zucchini.

Easy and flavorful. I used canned mushrooms and they were fine. I also added more seasoning - basil, oregano and parsley. You need to up the cooking time, it takes about 10 minutes for the zucchini to get soft. Great with fish

As is, I give this recipe 3.5 stars.  These recipe stars are so misleading b/c people give it 5 stars but they have modified the recipe so much, it is not the same.  If I could make it my own way, I'd give it 5 stars too!  I cooked it as directed and there is nothing about this recipe as listed that makes it more than 3 stars.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now, but haven't gotten around to reviewing it yet.  This is a great recipe.  Easy, colorful, and healthy!  I don't find any changes are necessary.  The recipe doesn't state exactly how long to cook the zucchini, but I usually sautee mine for about 7 - 8 minutes.  I also like to add some yellow squash.

We really enjoyed this recipe at our weekend barbecue. I made it ahead of time and then I put it in a casserole dish and sprinkled it with Parmesan Cheese. Just before dinner I heated it up in the oven. It received great reviews.

Delicious! The only thing I did was to omit the onions and use parsley, oregano, and thyme instead of 'italian seasoning'. Absolutely perfect :)

I had broccoli on hand and cooked that a bit in water before putting it in the skillet and it worked beautifully.   The onion, mushrooms and tomato, along with the seasoning make the main vegetable more savory.  Great veggie recipe!

Absolutey delicious!  I used 3 cloves of garlic, put in a whole yellow onion, used a can of diced tomatoes and added crushed red pepper.  Perfect with "Keligun Chicken".  I'm going to make it again soon.

I followed advice of others and substituted fresh basil for the Italian seasoning and added crushed red pepper, to taste. It was a great addition to the Lasagne Spinach Roll-Ups and Mardi's Broccoli Salad!

I made up something like this recipe on my own but found this recipe and decided to try it. I substituted oil spray for the oil and cut out the fat. It was good and I would make it again.

Has the tendency to get to mushy if you saute too long. Otherwise, a great deal. Added more minced garlic.

WOW! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish with our steak. I crumbled feta cheese ontop of the zucchini saute. For all those feta cheese lovers out there, I suggest you do the same. I'm definitly making this dish again. Thanks!

Thought maybe this would be like the zucchini squash saute you sometimes find as a side in steak houses that I love so much....but it wasn't.  Don't like zucchini that much, and this recipe didn't do much about that, or much of anything for me.  I'm probably a little bias, so if you really like zucchini this recipe might be great for you.
