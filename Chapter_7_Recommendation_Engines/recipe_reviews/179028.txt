Simple yet delicious. Change the boneless chicken breast to chicken thigh breast and cut with scissors around the bone. The chicken taste a lot better and it forces you to get creative to cut as much meat as possible (small chunks that cook quickly in the skillet). Everything I kept the same and didn't add salt or pepper...tastes great.

very good and easy. I did not have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken and it was great. Also added some onions and pepper.

I was looking for a quick easy meal to make that wasn't too much on a warm night. This seemed to be great....but the flavor was kinda blah. The 'sauce' was still way too liquidy for my taste and the soup just wasn't able to add enough flavor to all that water. I will just skip this next time around....thanks though!!

While this is a quick recipe, I did find it a bit bland.  I even seasoned chicken with Seasoned Garlic Salt and added minced onions, garlic powder, salt, pepper and extra basil to the soup, water at the beginning... I also used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic... I used half a bag Green Giant broccoli, cauliflower and carrots with cheese (removing bit of the cheese chips).  Still, I feel it could have used a bit more... I needed to use a half a cup more of water because it was too thick to cook the pasta (Barilla). Also, this barely served 3 adults... If I do make it again, I will consider making a double batch.  My husband and friend liked it enough. Though I'm not sure he will request again.

Decent weeknight dish.  I added a bunch of garlic and onion powders and it was still bland.  I used Cream of Chicken soup on accident, but I don't think it would have made a difference.  Great for a pinch, but even my easy going eaters weren't impressed.

This dish was sooo delicious!  I only had fresh mushrooms on hand & actually no veggies & I loved it anyway!  The fresh mushrooms added so much flavor to it.  I followed exactly as it said.  We couldn't get enough of it! I'm definitely making this again!

I marinated the chicken in lemon herb for 30 min, used fresh chopped veggies,a bit of italian spices and garlic powder. My boys loved it and the seasoning was just right for this cozy creamy dish.

The best part of this was that it was quick and easy.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper,  added some chopped  onions,  more cracked pepper. I used what was on hand, cream of chicken soup and whole wheat elbow macaroni.I also used Kraft shredded 4 cheese.
