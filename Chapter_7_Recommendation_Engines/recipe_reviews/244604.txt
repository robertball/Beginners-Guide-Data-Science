I used sirloin of pork boneless chops cut into cubes about 2.25lbs.  Once I lightly browned the meat I put all ingredients into a crockpot and cooked it about 2 1/2 hours. I added 2 cups more of my own chicken stock thickened it and served it over long grain white rice. Yummy!

Great base recipe! Substituted chicken breast for pork and added carrot and broccoli for colour and texture. My family actually prefers it served the day after, when the sauce has had a chance to saturate the meat and veggies.

I doubled the soy sauce & cornstarch to make it thicker and added 1 cup of salted cashews instead of 1/2 cup of almonds.
Really good!

This was pretty good. I left out the almonds due to personal preference. It did remind me a bit of the chow mein out of the can I had as a child. The pork was super tender but I prefer my veggies a little more crisp. The next time I make it I will simmer the pork for 20 minutes as directed but I prefer my onions, mushrooms, celery, and bean sprouts quick fried in a wok. As the recipe submitter stated, chicken would work really good in this recipe too.

I used leftover pork loin roast adding  it with the broth.   Very good basic recipe that can easily be modified to personal preference.
