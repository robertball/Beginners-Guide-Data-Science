This sounded so strange I had to try it. I loved the way the sweet prunes and salty bacon complimented eachother. Next time I will chop the prunes up more fine so they don't come out in big clumps. I can't eat buns though (no bread stuff) so I just had it with a side of cabbage. Fantastic dinner. It was a bit dry though, but still I am putting this in my recipe inbox.

This was wonderful. The sweet and salty contrast was really good. I wish prunes didn't have such a negative image.. think of them as dried plums instead. I used a peppered turkey bacon with this... delish!
