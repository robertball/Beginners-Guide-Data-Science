I found this recipe to be lengthy to make considering the marination time which totaled four hours. In addition My dinner party guests did not appear to enjoy this dish which was highly disappointing. It was very heavy and oily.

I found this dish to be very good! I used a generous amount fresh basil instead of dried and cut the olive oil down to 3/4 C. May use less next time. I think it would be good without the chicken as well. I will make this again.

My husband loved this recipe! He said it had a authentic flavor. There were few changes I had to make only because I didn't have all ingredients on hand. I didn't have goat cheese so I used mozzarella and it's way to cold and windy to grill so i used egg italian bread crumbs and fried the chicken in olive oil. I also used pre-marinated sun dried tomato's. This did make it a lot simpler. Next time I will make sure to grill the chicken and have goat cheese.

What a nice dish! The instructions kind of threw me for a loop--it basically keeps the pasta warming for an hour? So I changed that a tad. I roasted my own red and orange peppers on the grill (you basically blacken them put them in a bowl covered in plastic wrap for about 20 mins then slide off the blackened parts. Voila! Roasted peppers) and used about 2 total. I used the sundried tomatoes in oil and processed in the food processor--so much easier that way! I don't have fresh basil so I used dried and marinated overnight then tossed the pasta and cooked with some frozen chicken tenderloins for about 20 minutes-was delicious and great with some bread. I left out the cheese and we didn't notice. Thanks for the recipe!
