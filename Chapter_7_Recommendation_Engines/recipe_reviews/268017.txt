This is something I make all the time and when I want to make it into a stand alone meal I add rashers of streaky bacon thinly sliced to the mix before baking usually 3 rashers per head of broccoli

With just a few ingredients, you can have an easy and delicious side dish for any meal with this recipe! I was thinking that this might at least need some onion or garlic (they would both be great additions, btw), but it was really good without them! I could easily serve this with some baked chicken breasts or salmon filets for a complete dinner! Thank you for the recipe!
