This turned out to be a REALLY good recipe!  A few pointers so you can avoid the dogfood look another reader mentioned.  1) Don't turn the squash more than you have to.  Once in the roasting pan and once after you add cream to the saucepan will keep it from going mushy.  2) A little butter and a crushed clove of garlic added to the roasting pan deepens the flavor.  3) Don't let the cream fritter away in the saucepan or the squash/sausage mix will turn to stew and you won't have enough sauce for the penne.  4) You might not even need the pasta - the mix is that good.  This is a very tasty, restaurant-quality recipe and the slight drizzle of balsamico adds subtle sparkle to the flavor.  An Excellent dish - I'll make it again and again.

I customized, I roasted the squash for about 45 minutes to give it those nice carmelized edges.  I omited the sage completely.  I used milk and a touch of cornstarch instead of cream.  AND I added a skant 1/4 cup parmasean cheese.

I loved it and it made enough for leftovers for lunch.

I made some modifications, but the basic idea is great and I'll be making this one again!

I roasted the squash w/ olive oil, sage, a tbls of butter and a bit of chicken stock. 

We had neither sausage nor balsamic vinegar, but we had chicken breasts and vinaigrette salad dressing, so I baked the chicken w/ the vinaigrette and it came out super tender and tasty.

I chopped that up, tossed it and the squash together w/ the pasta, a splash of milk (no cream in the house, and we didn't want a heavy meal) and some parmesan cheese.  It was divine!

I used this recipe as a guide, but changed a few things based on reading other's reviews. I added about 5 cloves of garlic to the cookie sheet before roasting the squash. While the squash and garlic were roasting, I caramelized 1 medium onion in about 2 tbsp of butter. Please note that I omitted the balsamic vinegar completely from this recipe, but I did use dried sage, since I didn’t have fresh on hand. After the turkey sausage was completely cooked, I kept the flame on medium-low and added the caramelized onions to the pan, then added about ¾ cup of chicken broth, ¼ cup half and half, ¼ cup of fresh, grated parmesan and Romano cheese, and a dash of dried rosemary. I stirred this quite frequently. When the squash and garlic were done I added them to the sausage and onion mixture, being careful not to stir too vigorously so the squash cubes would remain intact. I used fresh linguine instead of penne, and as soon as the pasta was cooked, I drained it and poured the sausage mixture over it in a wide pasta bowl. For a finishing touch, I tore bits of fresh basil and tossed it on top. My husband and 7 year daughter devoured it! Take a look at my photo of this lovely dish! It was very flavorful. I may make it again using pork sausage!

This was just divine. I made a couple of alterations. i used skim milk instead of the cream to cut down the fat and added some diced up summer squash to the sauce as I had some I wanted to use up. I did forget to add the balsamic vinegar to my portion last night but I will remember to do that for the leftovers. Oh yes, I didn't have sausage so I used chicken breast. I really want to try this sometime when I can get my hands on some fresh sage. I looked in the store and there was none to be found

we love this! I used sweet Italian sausage ( cubed 1/2 in). Instead of roasting the squash ( also cubed 1/2 in.) and onion I sauteed them on med. high heat in a little olive oil, and in the same pan as I cooked the sausage. They carmelized nicely and the squash held its shape well.I also added some fresh sage to the sautee. After adding the half & half, more fresh sage, and a sbout a 1//3 cup fresh Parmesan cheese I let the sauce sit while the pasta cooked to blend the flavors. It was a great hit with the whole family.

My daughter made this today.  She used ground turkey burger in place of the turkey sausage.  She also used some (not the 2 tsp.) poultry seasoning (did not have any sage) and left out the vinegar.  She made it lighter using skim milk in place of the cream.  She will definately be making this again!  Great recipe!!!

This recipe bombed.  My child and husband hated it.  I'm not a very big fan of sage in food other than dressing anyway but this dish was bland and had no taste.  After a couple of bites, I had to throw the entire meal out.  Trust me, this one's bad!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I used prepared pork sausage w/ basil and garlic instead of turkey. I added 1 clove of garlic and about a tbsp. of butter to roast pan with the squash, and found that I needed to raise the heat to 400º. I added the sage a little at a time to taste. All in all I'd say the flavors went really well together and I would definitely make this again. Maybe for a party I'd serve it with a little fresh sage on top for color.

I made this last week for dinner.  It was pretty good.  My husband really liked it.  I only give it 4 stars because it's not very pretty, the dish looks all tan-colored to me.  BUT, I don't like to dice the squash b/c it's kinda tedious, so I roasted it, and therefore the squash was basically added to the pasta in a smashed state, not diced, so that's why it's not as neat and orderly as it should be.

Very good, but dry.  As other reviewers have noted, I used milk with cornstarch instead of cream, but I almost tripled the amount of liquid to keep the dish from being too dry.  Other than that, great mix of flavors.

it is a good jumping off point - I can't rate it a 5 because I changed too much of it.   I would rate my version a 5 though!  I subbed 1c cooked chicken breast and 4 slices of bacon, chopped, for the sausage.  I also added in 2c baby spinach that I cooked in the strainer when I drained the pasta.  I also added 2T asiago cheese.  My kids devoured it, and I loved it, too.  Went great with a nice merlot.

This recipe is good because it's easily adaptable. I turned this into an entirely vegan dish by substituting Gimme Lean "sausage" and soy creamer. I also used rice penne to make it gluten-free. Even my meat-eating linebacker of a husband wanted seconds, and wants me to make this dish again.

Some notes: making it vegan, I think, may have taken care of the dryness that some mention. Gimme Lean is inherently moist. In addition, you should definitely take the time to dice the squash. Mine turned out to be a lovely dish with the butternut neatly spread throughout in cubes. 

This dish is a winner; if you find yourself adapting recipes for your dietary needs, add this to your collection. I think adaptations improve it.

I gave this 4 stars as I didn't quite use the recipe, more 'inspired by' this recipe. I roasted the butternut squash with a little olive oil and black pepper, and also roasted chicken breasts (with glaze of olive oil, soy sauce, maple syrup and French mustard). Then, I sauted shallots in butter, added butternut squash, chicken and peas, before adding single cream, 2 tablespoons of parmesan and some chopped parsley. Finally added the cooked pasta to the pan, and served with garlic butter.

I thought this was very good. Having chunks of squash seems odd, but it works. Make sure you don't overcook the squash or it will be too mushy. You want it to have a bite to it!

This was an excellent dish.  I was impressed that even my picky boyfriend enjoyed it.  I suggest adding more cracked pepper at the end - it really intensifies all of the interesting flavors going on in this dish.

I followed the recipe to the letter. I made double the amount and gave some away to a few friends so they wouldn't have to cook. When we started eating dinner NO ONE liked the recipe. I think it was the balsamic vinegar that turned everyone off. I will NOT be making this recipe again. We REALLY didn't like it at all.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  The changes I made were:  I tossed the squash & onion in the olive oil before putting in roasting pan. Baked 35 min & squash was still somewhat firm.  After I added it to the meat & poured in the heavy cream, I covered the pan & turned to low heat so it could steam while I cooked the pasta.  Used bowtie pasta. I never added the pasta to the sauce mix, I just put the mix over the pasta on the plates.  It was excellent & made for great leftovers.  My husband wants me to make it again this week!!

I thought this was excellent! My husband gave it 4 stars.  The only change I made was to increase the heavy cream to one cup.  Otherwise, I didn't feel there would be enough sauce.  Don't be hesitant about adding the balsamic vinegar.  It really made the dish.

This recipe was rich with flavor. I used half the balsalmic vinegar that it called for...it seemed to be a bit much. Next time I will double the squash. My husband and I loved it!

I used Itialian sweet sausage for a little more flavor. I also used pre cut squash. I roasted garlic with the squash and onion rather than adding raw garlic at the end. Some in my family don't like balsamic so I left it out. I topped with freshly grated parmesan. I didn't bother to put the pasta in the skillet; I just added the squash mixture to the pasta in the serving dish. Don't "cube" squash too small and don't overcook. I doubled the recipe and will make again. A meal in itself!

This is a tasty recipe.  I left out the turkey though (I try to cook vegetarian).  The first time I made it I felt like the balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the flavor of the butternut squash, so I left it out the second time.  Tastes great either way, just depends on whether you want a strong balsamic vinegar taste or not.

My only complaint is that peeling butternut squashes is so hard!  I felt like I was going to slice my fingers off!  There must be an easier way to do this.

I loved this. Absolutely great use of butternut squash. Not too difficult and a hit  with my kids.  I used vegetarian sausage in place of the Turkey sausages (made myself from seitan)  Can't fault it at all; had to stop myself eating 2 portions!

Oh my. This may sound mean, but what a gooey gross mess. This is very gross. I am not a picky eater, but I could barely choke it down. Just thinking about this makes me wretch. Vinegar and squash and sausage...not good.

Wow-- this was so good.  I especially liked the squash, and I'm not usually a huge fan of squash!  Did some substitutions, based on the ingredients I had (elbow macaroni instead of penne, mild Italian sausage instead of turkey sausage).  Based on previous reviews, I did also nuke the squash in the microwave for 3 minutes before cutting into it, as well as preheating the baking sheet, and also adding butter and chopped garlic to the squash.  I cooked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then gently turned the squash cubes and cooked for 15 more minutes at 400 degrees (for carmelization on one side of the squash).  Yum, yum, yum!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I am relatively new to the recipe scene after only staying in my own home for 7 months now but I have tried a number of things by for imagination and just beautiful taste, this is by far my favourite.

I cooked it exactly as described, maybe adding more cream than suggested by its paid of regardless.

I still feel that it will take something out of the world to receive a 5 star rating but it takes nothing away from this meal.

Easy to prepare, cook and for the time taking, its worth every last drop.

i think this recipe would be delicious without the cream.  Nothing against cream sauces, but browned butter, sage and balsamic makes a delicious sauce.  I'm sure it would be amazing with the sausage and butternut squash!

My husband and I watch our carbs, so I eliminated the pasta in this dish. I tossed the butternut squash in olive oil, salt, pepper, italian seasoning and a bit of chili pepper. I sauteed the onion and garlic and added it to the butternut squash and baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes; while that was baking, I browned some tuscan ground sausage (I found in the deli dept. at the market), drained the sausage and added some chicken stock with a little flour to thicken it; I then added a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. After 30 minutes, I added the sausage to the butternut squash and baked it for 10 minutes; I added parmesan cheese to the top and baked for 5 more minutes. I served this with steamed brocolli. It was absolutely delicious!!!

Okay. Cream and balsamic -- together!?  I was skeptical. I tried it anyway. It was amazing! I skipped the sage and forgot the garlic and used half-and-half. Also, I only added the half-and-half to the portion we were going to eat tonight so the sauce would not get absorbed by the squash. It's will be easy to add more to the leftovers.  I added a little parm too (okay, and bacon, but who's keeping track?)

Very good.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  I used 1/2 a large butternut that I roasted with 1 T maple syrup and 2 T olive oil.  I used more squash, so I needed more liquid and I used fat free half and half.  I spinkled a few dried cranberries on top.  Leftovers yummy without the pasta....

followed recipe except I used mild italian sausage (not a fan of turkey) and used skim milk and cornstarch instead of heavy cream.  Also only used 2 tblsp instead of 3.5 of balsamic - seemed a lot.
 husband, who usually eats any recipe I try, wouldn't eat it.  WAY to sweet. i love balsamic and sage,  but i didn't finish my serving, either.  Just not good at all.  don't know what would improve it except maybe skipping balsamic all together.

We have made this several times and enjoy it, especially using pre cut squash.  This time we creamed the roasted squash and onions.  Better if you have people who would otherwise pick out the squash(me).  We also always use evaporated milk instead of cream because of price and convenience.

This dish was quite tasty before you drizzle with the balsamic vinegar but I must say, and my family completely agrees, that once you do add the vinegar, it totally makes the dish!  I was skeptical but tried it and delish! Thanks for the share! :)

Excellent flavour combination.  Be careful not to overcook the squash though, as it will quickly turn to mush when stirring.

I liked this dish. I did use the heavy cream, but I found it was a bit dry, so I added more until it was creamy enough for me. Also, I used vinaigrette salad dressing, because I had some on hand, bow-tie pasta and chicken sausage.  I think I'll use less garlic and possibly add some cubed fresh mozzarella next time, but I will definitely make it again.  Very tasty.

Excellent recipe, yum!  I followed it as written except for using milk instead of cream, and adding 1/4 c. parmesan cheese.  I also roasted the squash for a longer period of time so it would cook fully through.  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have sausage on hand so I used chicken breast chunks.  It was a little bland, but I think making it with sausage would make up for that.  I will be making this again!

This recipe was not at all what I expected... but excellent.  The contrast between the tart balsamic, rich meat/cream and the sweet butternut squash created a nice depth of flavor.  I doubled the squash (about 3 cups, 1/2 a squash) and used macaroni noodles (didn't have penne).  Other than that, no changes were necessary.  Pair this dish with a crunchy vegetable for a nice texture contrast.

This was excellent.  However, I did make a few of the suggested changes.  When I roasted the squash, I added sage and garlic.  I felt that 1/4 c cream was not enough. I ended up using almost a pint.  I also used mild Italian sausage as that is what I had in the freezer.  It worked well!  Will definitely make again!

It was too dry could use more of a sauce.  The cream and the balsamic vinaigrette made a sticky coagulation.  I probably wouldn’t make this again.

Loved it.  Did not use the vinegar. And I cooked pasta in chicken broth.   Husband can not have milk so used Rice milk.  Also he cooked onions and garlic in with the sausage.  After the sausage was done he  sauteed the squash in with the sausage for a few minutes.

I made this recipe pretty much "as is" - only used chicken sausage (Italian style) becuase I couldn't find turkey sausage. I also saved about a cup of the pasta water because some other reviews said it might come out dry.  I wound up using about 1/3 cup of the pasta water.  This was so fantastic!  I am making it again this week.  It was a wonderful fall flavored dish and the balsamic (which I was initially worried about adding) is very necessary to wake up all the flavors.

So I modified this recipe to my own tastes by using capellini instead of penne pasta. I also roasted the onions and squash with 1 clove of minced garlic and some butter, plus some cinnamon and a pinch or two of basil. I also used 2 baked chicken breasts in olive oil and basil instead of the sausage. it turned out exceptionally well. I see a lot of reviews saying it was bland but the extra basil and the cinnamon on the squash I think really helped, I might even add some rosemary next time. The Balsamic also complemented the sweet flavor of my squash very well. I loved it.

OMG, this is so good.  I made a couple of changes.  I didn't have any cream, so I used a little bit of almond milk and a bit of pasta water.  I used Italian sausage because that's what I had.  I am not crazy about sage, so I left it out. I added a handful of halved cherry tomatoes, some parmesan cheese and only 1 Tbsp of Basalmic because more than that just sounded like too much to me.  My husband said it was only a "7" (out of 10), but he ate seconds.  My son and I loved it.  Even better the second day.  I know I made a few changes, but this is a great one that I will be repeating!

I made some alterations to this recipe, but it was awesome!  We had a blizzard in New England last night and I was happy inside having this dish!  Here's what I did...
*I had already baked my squash.  I like doing that because it keeps is flavor nicely.  
*I also didn't want to use the slow-cook method.  
* I exchanged fresh sage for powdered.  
* I used a LOT less butter.
* no cheese. It was rich and delicious, so why add the fat?

Basically, I started with a big pot.
 I sautéed the shallots and mushrooms in a little butter until wilty
I then added barley and stirred for about 5 minutes.
I added the wine and stirred/cooked until it was absorbed.
I added everything else except for the squash and parsley.  
I put the cover on and turned down the heat a little.
I stirred occassionally.  
When the barley was fully cooked and the broth was absorbed, I scooped in the semi-mashed squash.
I put parsley on top.
It was amazing!
Thanks for posting this.  It was a perfect guide to just what I wanted.

The flavors of this dish were outstanding.Sage,garlic,onion,butternut squash with sausage just compliment each other so well.I used whole wheat spiral noodles to avoid mushiness.I used italian turkey sausage links cutting them.Fat free creamer and a bit of skim milk.I don't feel one onion is enough and used more.I sauted the garlic to bring the taste forward.No balsamic though.

Delicious!  I made it with chicken/apple sausage which was a tad too sweet.  Would have been tastier with a spicier sausage.  My daughter was hesitant about eating it.'Do you have to put squash in it mom?' But ended up loving it and going back for seconds. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Followed almost exactly as written (substituted Lactaid Milk for heavy creme - for obvious reasons) and was AMAZINGLY surprised.  My husband picked this out and when he told me he found a recipe that used butternut squash, sausage and vinegar I was very sceptical - so thank you.

I used acorn squash, rosemary, and left over ground beef and it was still so good!  The balsamic at the end is definitely a needed ingrediant - it makes the dish amazing!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but since I was lacking turkey sausage and sage...I had to make modifications. I also borrowed some from another recipe. I roasted the squash on 375 for 40 minutes, and put 1/2 an onion in the last 20 minutes. Next time I try this recipe I'll do it for 30 minutes at 350, since the squash started to fall apart when I mixed it with the other ingredients. I used 1/4 c. of half and half and next time will use more, because I like having more sauce :) I added parsley and parmesan cheese at the end! :)

I made this with spaghetti squash instead of pasta so it turned out very moist.  I found that cooking the vegetables just to al dente made for a better texture and fresh taste.  I forgot the balsamic at the end, but it was still good with some Parmesan added.

I used chicken instead of sausage, as some others suggested, and also used part milk/cornstarch, part heavy cream.  I cooked the chicken in the basalmic, and pretty much just tossed everything else together.  Oh, I also roasted the squash (chopped into small cubes) till it was starting to caramelize, which did take longer than 30 minutes -- yum!  That was also a suggestion from another reviewer.  I thought it was absolutely delicious!  I love butternut squash, so it isn't really hard to please me.  Hubby loved it also.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe, however, I don't think it needs the cream. I added a little bit of milk, but that's about it and it was super creamy.  The sage is fantastic. I didn't roast the squash, but shredded it in the food processor and then just loosely sauced it.

This was great! Though we're not vegetarians we tend to lean more towards vegetarian meals. So in place of the ground turkey, we used some soy andouille. And omitted the rosemary because the andouille has quite a bit of seasoning. 

Oh, and I was out of heavy cream and used half/half in it's place. Probably not as heavy, but really yummy! We'll keep and do this one again.

Although this recipe was a lot of work, it tasted delicious!  My 1year old & 3 year old not only ate it, but had seconds!  I did not have butternut squash, but I had yellow summer squash; it turned out great!

Super rich recipe. My sauce came out really thick and goopy. Had good flavor but I think I will try it next time with a browned butter sauce instead.

I left out the meat & used steamed summer squash.  I used whole milk instead of cream.  I served it cold the next day.  The flavors had time to blend in the frig.  A lovely light lunch fare with nice delicate flavors.  Will make again.

I made it and we ate it - the balsamic vinegar MAKES this recipe.  I used some left over turkey breast and added a little chili powder. Just used what I had on hand.

Excellent fusion of flavors.  I did not change any of the ingredients - just didn't have the Sage, so I made it without. My husband has a very particular palate and he loved it!  I made it one night and since we both enjoyed it so much - and I had plenty of the ingredients left over - I made a double-batch.  So, we had it for two dinners and, now, will both enjoy what's left for our work lunches.  A must try!

So it’s the day after Thanksgiving… I actually don’t have any leftovers, but I do have a whole butternut squash that I don’t know what to do with. I also have turkey sausage in the freezer. Hmmmm...I did my search and found this recipe. It was awesome! What a great use of the butternut squash and the turkey sausage… Instead of sage I substituted some fresh basil that I had. I also added half of red pepper (small dice) just to get rid of what was in the fridge… One more change… Did not have any heavy cream, but had lots of sour cream… Substituted in the sour cream along with a little milk in place of the heavy cream! Very tasty! I honestly had no idea what how this was going to turn out. So glad I gave it a shot!

This was amazing stuff.  I tweaked it to make it vegetarian (well, I guess actually vegan).  Instead of heavy cream, use cashew milk.  It is very creamy and has 1/2 the calories of skim milk.  I used "Field Roast Grain" Meat Sausages-the smoked apple sage flavor.  I get it at Whole Foods but I've seen it at some of the Price Choppers and high end grocers.

It was a good recipe with compliments from my husband. Reading back the recipe I see I completely forgot the balsamic. As other users suggested I roasted the squash  as directed with some butter and garlic added. I also separated the squash from the onions after baking. I only added the squash just before serving with one stir at the end. I increased the cream slightly and added some chicken broth and some of the pasta water, just to increase the amount of sauce. (I thickened it a little with cornstarch so it would stick to the pasta better). As I do with all pasta, I topped it with some parmesan as well. I will make this again! ( see the result in the pictures. I served with a Caprese Salad)

This is excellent-my family could not stop raving about it! I only made a few changes, the first being to add the garlic with the squash and onions for roasting (I don't particularly like the flavor of raw garlic). I also used Italian flavored chicken sausage, a brand that my local grocery store carries which is always good. Finally, I made this with gluten free penne from Trader Joe's (I have Celiac disease), and my family didn't know they were eating brown rice pasta until I told them! Oh, I also used fresh sage, I'm always looking for ways to incorporate my favorite fresh herb into recipes-it worked very well. Go easy on the balsamic at the end-we just drizzled it over each serving from a cruet, which added a nice sweet finish, but I could see how too much would kill the dish. This is one of the best recipes I've tried in a long time, and a great way to use one of fall's best harvests-enjoy!

Very good, very different. Drizzled squash and large ch. onions with EVOO.   Added pasta.to cooked sausage (take sausage out of casing before cooking) then added about 1/3 c. milk mixed w/cornstarch, thickened this and then added about 1 c. chicken bouillion. Added slightly less sage, and slightly less balsalmic vinegar. Gently stirred in squash right at end to avoid mushing it.
       2nd time added squash mix. to cooked sausage.  Added 1 tsp. fresh ch. sage plus some dried sage and 2 tsp. fresh ch. basil, at least 1/2 c. ff 1/2 & 1/2, possibly more, and 1/4 C. parmesan cheese.  Then added pasta and tossed, and then added full amt. of balsamic vinegar, maybe a little more.

This was a delicious recipe.  To give it a bit more flavor, I used chipolte olive oil and hot and spicy turkey sausage.  I also used less sage, since I am not a big fan.

This is my first review, this dish was really good despite the low number of reviews which is why I wanted to add my own.  I added a bell pepper to it and roasted my garlic cloves with the squash and onions.  It was very good overall.  My only complaint would probably be not enough left over sauce...my pasta probably sucked it up.

My family loved this meal.  I used hot italian turkey sausage wich mixed up great with the sweatness of the sauce.  I added half a green pepper for a dash of color.  I only added 2 tablespoons of the vinager because we don't like things real sweet.  It taste good even without the vinager.  It does lose some of its sweet taste the next day, so if you want to add a little more vinager to it before serving again.

I have made this several times now and each time is fantastic. I have now shared the recipe with several friends and they loved it too. This is deffinately a keeper. The last time I made it I didn't have sage so I used oregano and it was just as good, just a slightly different flavor.

This recipe is really different and very good. I used 3 tablespoons of fresh sage and fat free milk instead of the cream because I am on weight watchers. By cutting out the cream and using wheat pasta this is a core friendly meal! Just be careful you do not over roast the squash, it will come out too mushy.

Delish! I used ground turkey with some cayenne pepper, white pepper, allspice and Italian seasonings added to create the sausagey flavor. Also, as per other reviews, I added some butter and a clove of garlic to the onion and squash while roasting. The balsamic vinegar was the key; it completely transformed the dish from ordinary to awesome! Well done!

I had a dish similar to this at a restaurant in Banff...I made this with chicken breasts turned out pretty good not quite 5 stars I found it a little dry could have used a little more of a sauce maybe a little extra cream or oil next time

To be fair, I will preface this review by saying we did make some significant modifications to this recipe. First of all, we veganized it so we replaced the turkey sausage with vegan style sausage crumbles. Also, we used a vegan style creme instead of the heavy cream. That being said, we weren't impressed with the taste. As another review noted, it tasted bland, like it needed something else to pull everything together. We also tried doing half with the balsamic vinegar and half without (since I don't like balsamic vinegar but my husband does). My hubby tried both versions and said the balsamic vinegar was just a strange addition.

Suggestion:  this recipe should say that you'll need 5-10 minutes to "cube" the pumpkin.  Otherwise, a very nice recipe for Autumn.
