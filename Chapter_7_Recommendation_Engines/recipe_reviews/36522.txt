I don't cook. My wife does. However, in an effort to help my wife, because we were in a time crunch, I found this website and this recipe. I don't even know what dry mustard or white wine vinegar are. Be that as it may, I made this salad and it was great. Very tasty flavored with the salt of the bacon and the sweet of the honey. Because of the ease of making this salad and how good it came out I've actually joined this site and am currently looking up other recipes I can make.

I thought this recipe was great! I used a teaspoon of real dijon mustard instead of dry mustard and used turkey bacon instead of the real thing (just as good). I wanted to make more of a "meal" out of this so I added grilled chicken breast as well and it really was terrific!

This salad is great!  Nice combination of flavors.  I did not add the bacon and it was still a very good salad minus all the fat.  Very easy to make.  The dressing is also fabulous.

Outstanding salad, Barbara! For personal preference I cut the honey to 1 1/2T, added 1t Dijon in addition to the dry mustard, omitted celery salt and added 1/2c diced celery, and toasted the almonds. WONDERFUL FLAVOR and CRUNCH! Thanks much.

Loved this salad!  Definitely recommend waiting until the last minute to toss with the dressing, and in my opinion it is better to add less than you think you need, and serve the rest at the table.  I could not find white wine vinegar and used white vinegar instead.  It worked. I also toasted the almonds before adding to the salad, and was sure to drain the mandarins really good!  Do NOT save this salad as leftovers! You won't be able to eat it, make everyone have seconds!  I'm sure they will want to anyway.  Great recipe!

The first time I made this dressing, using Extra Virgin Olive Oil, I found it tasted too oily.  So, I threw that out and started over, using Canola Oil.  I thought it still tasted too oily, so next time I would cut the oil in half.  To compensate for the oily taste, I added Balsamic Vinegar and a dash of lemon juice.  That seemed to do the trick, at least for my taste buds.  I will definitely make this again.

In a word - Fabulous! And, just as the submitter states, "oh so good and refreshing"!  This was a great combination of flavors and gave a nice presentation. The dressing was spot on and like others I subbed dijon for the dry mustard. I opted for thin sliced red onion vs. green and topped this with grilled chicken. This was so easy to throw together and made for a tasty, light summer meal.  All I had to do was serve it with warm rolls and a nice glass of wine! Thanks for a great recipe - it's one I'll definitely make again.

I love this recipe.  Took it to a luncheon pot luck & it got rave reviews.  Don't assemble the salad until you are ready to serve though (will get soggy~ just bring all ingredients in seperate bags/containers).  Used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Also added green peppers.  So good:)

I first made this during this past summer and have taken it to several functions since- what a phenomenal salad! Previous reviews were very helpful and I did make multiple alterations: added craisins, use 1/2 oil and substitute canola, bell peppers instead of green onion, plain white vinegar instead of white wine (just used what I already had), Romaine lettuce instead of red leaf, added lemon juice and tabasco to dressing. As we were all eating this at a family get-together, my aunt even asked when I had "gotten so gourmet!" The almonds and bacon are especially good additions. A very fun to make, pretty and yummy salad!

This was very appealing to the eye, but I wasn't too thrilled with the taste.  I have no idea why, but it just wasn't what we expected.  I like the ideas of all the ingredients, but I think I will have to experiment some with this so that it suits us.  Thanks for the post.

Great dressing.  Don't toss until just before eating and don't use too many oranges or the lettuce goes limp.

Also, does dry hot mustard mean wasabi powder (a hot green mustard used in japanese cooking)?  That's what I used and I loved it.

A wonderful combination of sweet, crunchy and tang. I had a nice head of fresh red leaf lettuce which I tore into bite size pieces.  I reduced the amount of olive oil called for. I used real dijon mustard instead of dry mustard, omitted the green onions due to personal preference. I adjusted the salad dressing while blending to my tastes, adding only a pinch of ground paprika, then chilled it before serving. I also took the 3/4 cup of slivered almonds and lightly toasted them in a pan with a little white sugar to give it a sweet carmelized crunch. The carmelized almonds added even more of a touch to the salad. I took  a few strips of turkey bacon, instead of regular, baked it, cooled, crumbled over the salad. This gave it a light salty balance to the sweetness and tang already in the dressing. I chilled the mandarin oranges in the refrigerator as well. Right before dinner, I threw everything together and then poured the dressing lightly over everything. I really enjoyed this light and refreshing salad and is deserving of  5 stars in my book. I also like how I can adjust the dressing to my tastes if needed. You can even add a grilled chicken to the salad making it a meal.

This salad was great!  It was very easy to make and was a big hit.  I used a prepared bag of romaine lettuce instead fo the red leaf.  I highly reccommend this recipe!

I cheated and used bacon bits instead of real bacon.  Saves on time and also reduces the amount of fat.  The salad itself is good, but the dressing is a very sweet.  It's not something I would want to have for every meal, but o.k. once in awhile.

This salad was a wonderful addition to my Easter brunch.  I did have to make some changes, simply because I didn't have some ingredients I subsituted the hot mustard for regular dry mustard, to have the hot or spicey I used spicey paprika. I also used turkey bacon, simply for dietary issues. I found that the dressing was difficult to blend (I believe due to the honey) but found my teenage son to shake it up a bit.  Not only is the presentation of this salad beautiful, I simply could not not get enough of it!

This was delicious!  I will definately do this again.  I used about 1/3 of a cup of packaged bacon bits to cut down on saturated fat and to avoid the clean up of cooking bacon!  Thanks

I loved the salad but the dressing had a strong flavor of olive oil...Maybe a lighter oil would be better.  
I also only had dijon on hand (I'm in Europe, so it was French) and that gave a very sharp after taste, but that was my fault.  Otherwise very eye appealing!

Very tasty! The bacon and almond adds bulk, and the dressing is a great combo of flavors. I made a vegan version with SmartLife veggie bacon, and I substituted agave nectar for honey.

I used a combination of italian mix and baby field greens mix (bagged), and ommitted the dry hot mustard and the bacon.  I also toasted the almonds in 1 Tblsp butter and then sprinkled white sugar on them while they cooled. The salad was GONE, and my dinner guests asked for the recipe before leaving.  Great recipe, thanks!

This is definitely a salad to make if you're on a diet...but it is delicious! I made it for a potluck dinner with friends..we have a friend that won't touch vegetables, but he was easily persuaded to try it after hearing everyone talk about it!
Great addition to my recipe box!

Just made this today for the first time. I doubled the recipe and use a tad less honey than the recipe called for. The olive oil taste was a tad strong for me, but this is hardly worth mentioning. I am sure that as this sits and the flavors meld it will become less prominent. This is a wonderful recipe! The dressing is both sweet and tangy. I used regular dry mustard. Thank you.

This was so good! The dressing was very easy to make - and the salad was very pretty. I used slivered almonds and forgot to toast them - they are always better that way - so I'll have to remember next time! I had a red bell pepper on hand, and it really went well in the salad.

I made this for Mother's day dinner and it was fabulous.  I doubled it and passed around goat cheese to top it.  It was so good.

This is absolutely the best salad in the world!  I added the craisins, and it was an EXCELLENT touch!  I doubled the recipe, and 10 adults nearly went through it!  RAVE reviews!  In the future when I choose to make a different salad, I think I will always wish I made this one instead!  But I don't want to over do it!  I served it with a wonderful egg casserole from this site called Brunch on th Bayou, and it was the perfect complement! All my guests were VERY, VERY complementary and wanted all the recipies!  I was so pleased!

Great salad.  I took another reviewers advice and added a bit of craisins, I also used canola oil for a lighter flavor. I made this to go with Apricot Ginger Game Hens and it was perfect.  Thank you for this recipe, I will use it often.

This salad is AMAZING> 
The homemade dressing compliments the ingredients in the salad very well. I served it with Egg Drop soup from this site for a healthy, relatively easy dinner.

I made this as part of our Valentine's Dinner and my husband loved it!  I'll be making it for a family potluck this weekend.  I substituted celery flakes for the celery salt. Also, I didn't have hot dry mustard (and my grocery store didn't carry it...) so I used regular dry mustard and added a dash each of crushed cayenne pepper and chili spice instead.  I also added some fresh raspberries with the mandarins.  So good and so easy!  The salad looked deliciously beautiful and tasted even better!!!

Made this for a luncheon -- it was a huge success!!  Just the right amount of tart-sweet taste.  The only thing I did differently was sauted the almonds in a bit of butter, then laid them on a paper towel.  MMMMMMM-Good!!

This is a Sweet and Savory combination, a must make for family and dinner guests!  I loved the ease of preparing because I had most items already in the cupboard..  My guests insisted on going home with the recipe for this salad and I continue to get requests from my family to make this instead of the boring salad.   You really must try!!

This salad was delicious. Goes with anything, and it is easy to make. I skipped cooking my own bacon and bought the bagged real bacon pieces by Hormel. The dressing was delicious as well, although I probably didn't need as much. Next time I won't add all of the dressing and see how much I need.

DELICIOUS!  We loved this salad - the dressing is wonderful and the red leaf lettuce is a nice change from iceberg or romaine.  Will definitely turn to this recipe often!

Fantastic!  I followed other suggestions to add craisins and substituted cashews for the almonds.  The dressing was outstanding.  I used up the last bit of it by adding a touch of orange juice to stretch it and then tossed some grilled chicken into the salad.  It made for a great lunch the next day.

Absolutely delicious!  Used regular dry mustard instead of hot dry mustard.  and I added just a touch of the leftover orange juice to the dressing.  (careful if doing this, it could make your salad soupy!) I served this w/ teriyaki burgers, which were also sweet, so it complemented very nicely.  I even put some of the salad inside the assembled burger, yummy!  My guests loved it, will most definitely make again!

What a wonderful salad! I'm not a fan of mustard, so I substituted the Asian Ginger Dressing (also on this web site), and it was so delicious. I might try using romaine or something sturdier next time so that the greens don't get soggy too quickly. I also chopped up the mandarin oranges a little so that they were distributed a little more throughout the salad.

This salad is my FAVORITE salad.  I recommend two additions to this salad though.  The first addition is craisons.  The craisons not only had more color to the salad but also more flavor.  I used 1/2 a bag.  The second addition is tabasco sauce to the dressing.  Just about 4-8 drops.  Other than that, follow the recipe as directed too and you will have everyone asking you for the recipe. Fabulous.

This was wonderful!  I was unable to find dry hot mustard in the stores so I just used regular dry mustard and it still turned out great.  The recipe say's it will serve 8 but my salad was wiped clean from the bowl with 6 people.  I will make this again, and pass the recipe on to my friends and family who asked for it.

This was VERY nice. A great blend of ingredients -- kind of sweet, but not TOO much so. I'll make it again and again. In fact, I have a pot-luck to attend this Friday and know it will be a hit with everyone, so I am making it for the third time in one week. Yum!! :)

I halved this recipe, used real bacon bits and left out the onions.I like the blend of flavors together, but offered the dressing on the side.  Next time I will use LESS olive oil as I felt it overpowered the other flavors.  Will definitely served in the summer with grilled chicken or fish.

I made this salad for lunch today for me and my husband.  We both agree it's a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly but added prepackaged seasoned croutons and toasted the almonds.  I didn't have any celery salt, so I ground up some celery seed along with a little sea salt in a mortar/pestle and it worked fine. I also couldn't find white wine vinegar, so I used rice vinegar.   Thanks for this delightful salad recipe!

Delicious salad.   I made it twice for two different parties and people who usually don't like salad gobbled it up.  I used cashews one day and walnuts the next instead of the almonds.  Thanks for a wonderfull recipe.

Fixed this for company, and got rave reviews.  I went with the suggestion to use veg. oil, but otherwise followed recipe exactly, and it was great.  Dressing complimented the salad perfectly.

This salad was a great success at a dinner party I threw last night.  The only addition I made to the recipe was to add some blackberries that we just happened to have.

This was excellent.  Everyone loved this salad.  I didn't have any hot dry mustard so I used dijon mustard instead and it still turned out great.  I will definitely make again.

I brought this to a dinner party and everyone there came back for second and third helpings.  (And probably would have had more but it was gone)  This is an excellent salad and the homemade dressing is fantastic!  I will definitely make this again and again.

Dressing was a little oily as written, so I ended up increasing everything else until it tasted right.  A few drops of sesame oil really added a lot to the dressing.  Pineapple is a good substitute for mandarin oranges.

Very good.  I don't care for sweet dressings because often they are very cloying.  This one is not.  It's well balanced and goes well with the sweet oranges, savoury bacon and crunchy lettuce and almonds.

Made this for bunco. It was very easy and very good. I used bagged mixed lettuce and spinach and took the suggestion for honey roasted almonds. We were practically licking the bowl clean!

I will definitely make this again, but I would cut down the olive oil in this recipe.  Other than that, it was so good!  Like others, I added craisins, and used honey roasted almonds.  I also used a mix of iceburg and red lettuces.  Very tasty, thank you!

Excellent flavor, but it wilted quickly.  Next time I would try romaine lettuce, as another review suggested, and then maybe it would hold up better.

It was very good and i would make it againbut with a little less paprika.  I added some lemon juice which tasted very good in it.  I wasn't a fan of hot sauce in it so I think I'd use crushed red pepper.  I used a half bag of craisins.  I thought red leaf lettuce worked great.

I served this to a crowd of 18 and they LOVED it! (Super that this site lets you scale a recipe with a few clicks of the mouse.) I liked that I could put it together early and just "dress" it right before serving it. For my personal taste, I'd cut the sweet down some.

My husband and I like this but my children balked.  I suspect onions were the culprit and I plan to try this again without them to see if it appeals to the kids.  4 stars because it was lost on my kids-but tasted pretty great for the adult palettes in my home.  I'll try again, thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I wasn't crazy about the dressing, but only had regular prepared mustard on hand, so could be my fault.  Will try with a vinaigrette next time!

Yum! I followed the recipe except for using 1/8 tsp salt instead of celery salt (didn't have any).  Next time, I may serve the mandarin oranges on the side for anyone who wants them.  I wasn't a big fan of them, but my mom liked them.

Awesome salad!!!  The dressing was perfect - I used Dijon mustard instead of hot dry mustard because all I had was regular dry mustard.  My husband loved it too!  I just used bacon bits instead of frying bacon.  I added some grilled chicken and it was great!  I'll definitely have this salad again - very flavorful.

Dressing wasn't anything special to me.  I do like the oranges in the salad, but the rest was just blah.

Very tasty! I used half romaine lettuce and half red leaf. Next time, I will add some dried cranberries.

Made this recipe as written for a family dinner. Everybody loved it, and I thought it was good but not "WOW!" Will make again though. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent. I made this for a dinner party the other night and usually salads are not the crowd pleaser with the late 20 to early 30 year old males that tend to come for the main dishes.  One of the guest had brought some garden fresh romaine lettuce and I used this recipe to incorporate the gift into the meal.  All raved about it.  I had a little honey left in the bottom of the bear, so I used that to mix the dressing in and added just a little sugar to make up some of the sweet that was lost with the lesser amount of honey.  Also I had a red wine vinegar on hand that I used instead of the rice.  I omitted the onions for personal taste but added some garlic chive from the garden.  I also added some pine nuts for a little texture.  I have a small glass ewer that I use to serve dressings in and so I used that so the guest could add as much or little as they wanted and no soggy salad by the end of the meal.  Definitely will make this again, very quick, easy, and most ingredients are on hand to either make exactly or do a very good variation.

I don't do the onions and I add a cup of crumbled gorgonzola cheese. And I make twice the amount of dressing it calls for.

Delicious salad! As suggested by many reviewers, I added sweetened cranberries, cut the oil and honey back slightly, used packed honey roasted almonds and used pre-cooked bacon pieces. I also substituted Rice Wine Vinegar for the white and added an avocado. So yummy!

This is the perfect salad for hot summer days when you don't want to cook big a meal, just add a loaf of bread and there's dinner. The dressing is delicious, I added cut up chicken and celery for added flavor. Perfect! will make again!

DELICIOUS!!!  I'll probably put in less honey next time since it was a bit sweet for me.  I would alway buy salads like this back home for about $6-$7 a plate.  I'll add grilled chicken next time. Thank you for sharing. God bless!

This is soooooo good.  We grilled chicken and put on top to make a meal out of it.  We couldn't stop eating it.  It was so refreshing and wonderful.  The only change I made was added a tad more honey for our taste.

This is a really tasteful, easy salad great for having with friends as part of a larger meal. I added pre-roasted, salted almonds and sliced them myself for more flavor. I also doubled the mandarin oranges.

This was really good - I can see why it has been rated so well!  I used Sesame Honey almonds from Trader Joes and they added a nice sweetness.  My only comment is that next time I might use something other than red lettuce because it wilted rather quickly.  The salad was still really yummy but it just did not look as good on a buffet table.

Very yummy salad!  I brought to a pitch in dinner and it was enjoyed by all.  I made a few changes.  I used baby spinach leaves and cut back on the amount of honey in the dressing.  I might add mushrooms next time!

I made this salad for a dinner party and everyone loved it!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I used a little bit less (like 1 tbs. less) olive oil than the recipe called for, and I think it was perfect that way.  I also was unable to find dry HOT mustard, and just used regular ground mustard.  GREAT salad!

This is a great salad, the dressing has a very nice tangy flavor.  Will definately make this again. 
I made this along with the Grilled Salmon with Ginger Orange Glaze (also on this site) and they went really well together.

Yummy!  I had a bit too much dressing, but I think Wal-mart jipped me on the red leaf lettuce.
Nonetheless, hubby and I both enjoyed this salad very much.  I will be making this again this week.  Very, very good!  Thanks!

Just made as a light salad for Thanksgiving. Salad was ok but nothing to rave about.  I would increase bacon and oranges. Dressing was bland. Not sure how to step up flavor.

I love this salad. Sometimes I make it just for me as a lunch salad, and when I do this I don't use bacon. I put grilled chicken on the salad to make it more of a meal, and it is also very tasty.

This salad was good. I omitted the bacon and used dijon mustard. Next time I will use only half of the honey because it was too sweet for my taste.

My husband and I had this salad for lunch the other day and both loved it! The only change I made was to serve it using iceberg lettus. My husband loves wedge salads, so I just cut out a wedge of the lettus and piled everything on top and around it. This dressing is wonderful.

Very delicious.  I omitted the onions & only used half of the vinegrette.  'Makes for a pretty & tangy garnish/side dish.

Good tasting salad.  Only change I made to recipe was that I reduced the amount of green onions as I am not a big fan.  I have made twice for dinner guests and everyone enjoyed!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it had reaaly good flavor. I used prepacked real bacon pieces instead of browning my own, and I also added spinach leaves along with the red lettuce.

This was good. I halved the oil, didn’t use the bacon and we toasted the almonds and doubled them. I think the dressing could have used more vinegar; will add a bit more next time. Served it at Thanksgiving dinner and it complemented the meal well.

The dressing was yummy.  I did use plain white vinegar  as others suggested.  

At the last minute i realized i didn’t have mandarin oranges, so I just threw in a big hand full of craisins.   I did cheat and used a handful of bagged bacon.

It was very good.  I will be making this again....  will be a good one for company.

Brought this to a party and it was just ok.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was very bland. It had a strong olive oil flavor which normally I don't mind. I waited until right before serving to toss with the dressing per suggestions so it wouldn't wilt. After tasting it, I added balsamic vinegar and some salt and pepper. That helped a bit but it still wasn't great.  Didn't get any compliments on the dish at the party. :(

I love salads like this. I followed the directions except didn't have any dry hot mustard. I just used regular dry mustard. Delicious, light dressing.

I'm not usually into salad, but this one is incredible.  In fact, it's so incredible that I get asked for the recipe every time I take it to a pot-luck...and I've had to quadruple the recipe every time I take it in.  Super yum.

I've been making this salad for years.  The dressing causes the lettuce to wilt, so it really needs to be eaten right away.  I usually make this to take to reunions and family dinners, and I always get compliments on it.  Often, I make the dressing and keep it in a container for use on other salads.  It's very difficult to get my husband to eat salad, but even he will eat one if I put this dressing on it!

Made for missionary luncheon with other salads. It was the first to disappear. Made no changes.

Made as is and loved it.  Notes:  a head of red lettuce doesn't go as far as you might think, and cut the amout of dressing and the amount of bacon to make it more healthful.  Also suggest adding the dressing to plain lettuce to it's easier to distribute other ingredients evenly.
