This is a very good recipe for bolognese sauce.  Of course, as with most recipes, a little tweaking made it superb.  I also fried the bacon first, then removed it from the pan and fried my onion, celery and shredded carrot in the bacon fat.  When they were soft, I added the pork, beef and garlic.  Then I followed it exactly as it was.  I remember watching Emeril on the Food Network and he always fried his "mirepoix" (celery, onion and carrots) when he made his sauces and it really made the flavour much better.  Very tasty recipe.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  I have made it a number of times both for my family and for dinner parties.  I have gotten rave reviews each time I have made it, and there is rarely any left.  Even my picky husband loves it.  I brown the bacon first and then remove the bacon from the pan leaving the grease behind to saute the onions in.  I found that when cooking the bacon and onions together, as suggested in the recipe, the bacon never really browns and is kind of soggy and rubbery from all the liquid the onions create while cooking.  I also double the amount of tomato sauce for a little runnier sauce.  I cook the sauce in a crockpot on low setting for the afternoon instead of in a saucepan on the stove.  Great recipe, we really love it!

This is just your basic, everyday bolognese sauce. I only see one problem with this recipe... dried herbs. If you're going to use herbs, do it right and use fresh. They have about five times more flavor than their dried brethren and they don't stay in your spice rack for five-six years at a stretch. I would probably also triple the amount of garlic in the recipe.

AWESOME & DIVINE!!! I am bad about not following a recipe.......the only change I made with this GREAT recipe was the substitution of sliced/chopped Prosciutto Ham instead of the bacon...less grease and personal favor. I topped the finished pasta bowls with grated Asiago Cheese. I had guest over and they flipped!!!! Thanx for sharing!!

This was really good spaghetti sauce.  I am unable to follow recipe directions without changing a few things, so this is what I did.  I used 3 oz of pancetta in place of the bacon and I used 4 cloves of roughly chopped garlic.  I sauteed the pancetta along with the olive oil until crispy and then I removed it from the pan.  Then I added the onions, carrots, celery and garlic.  Once soft, I added the mushrooms and about 5 minutes later, I added the meat.  I cooked this until the meat was cooked through, then added the pancetta back to the pan. I added 400 ml of tomato sauce and a large can of San Marzano plum tomatoes along with the wine and broth.  I cooked this for about an hour and a half and added about 1/3 cup of ketchup (you'd be surprised how many professional chef's rely on ketchup to make a classic bolognese taste 'complete').  The end result was really delicious spaghetti sauce that I won't hesitate to make again.

Excellent! Wonderful flavors! I made a double batch and I'm glad I did; it will be well worth pulling from the freezer when needed. I did make a few changes that all worked tastily: Cooking the bacon first was a great idea; thanks APRILSNYDER. I used both white Spanish onion and red onion; saut√©ed until well caramelized. I substituted sweet Italian pork sausage for the ground pork; yum. I doubled the amount of celery and next time I'll also halve the carrots and chop them and the onions more finely. IMPORTANT NOTE: The recipe calls for a 6oz. can of tomato sauce - but tomato sauce comes in 8oz. cans, I believe the author meant tomato paste which is used to thicken sauces and comes on 6oz. cans. Fantastic - don't forget the fresh grated Parmesan and a sprig of fresh basil for garnish.

To make the bacon more palatable...take the bacon, onion, carrots, & garlic and olive oil and put them in a food processor and grind them up into a paste.  Then carmelize this mixture.  I also agree that it needs the tomato paste and a quart size can of tomato sauce.  When I make this recipe, my family says that this is the best I have ever made...and I am Italian and have been making wonderful spaghetti sauce for years!

My family truly enjoyed this sauce. It is rich and flavorful. It is very authentic. I did add quite a bit more tomato sauce, wine, and chicken stock than it called for.I also increased the simmer time.

Thanks so much for this recipe, Kimber!  This sauce is excellent and I only made minor changes.  I cooked the bacon seperately as suggested by another reviewer so that it would crisp up nicely, added 6 oz. of tomato paste and I chopped the carrots intead of shredding them.  My husband and I devoured our plates, and there is plenty left over.  Very hearty and full of flavor.  Thanks again!

I, like most reviewers, had to adjust this recipe to make it tasty. I personally think there is a major technique fault in this recipe in that it doesn't call for the mushroom/carrots/celery to be sauteed yet a lot of people recognized that and did it anyway.  This process develops the flavor of the vegetables--a must in just about any recipe (even vegetable soup).  Also, the sauce/paste issue is a major fault.  Tomato paste is a must. One last thing, never serve sauce on top of plain, white pasta.  The pasta should be stirred into the sauce so it is coated. Save a little pasta water to help loosen it up if needed.  My Italian grandmother taught me this.  I think this pile of white pasta habit was developed from American restaurants trying to cut down on costs.  It is not the Italian way!

"Stupendously delicious!" declares my boyfriend!  I made only a few changes and think they changed the recipe from 4 to 5 stars.  First, I fried the bacon, removed it from the pan and reserved the grease in the pan.  Second, I fried the onions, carrots, and celery, with one extra stalk of celery in the bacon fat over medium-high heat until the vegetables softened, about 7 or 8 minutes.  I removed the veggies and set them aside.  Third, I fried the meat and as it browned, I added the garlic.   Fourth, I used fresh herbs instead of dried, and tripled the amount.  Fifth, I added all ingredients together in an oven-safe pan and cooked it for two hours on 250 F in a convection oven.  This cooking process allows the amino acids and sugars to combine into some amazing flavors and aromas.  It also results in a little dehydration, which makes the sauce a little drier/thicker and much richer.  Absolutely wonderful!

I really liked this recipe; it was very simple to make and yielded quite a bit.  I wanted it a little more "saucy" so I added an extra can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato paste.  Would make it again.

I made a few small changes only to use what I had on hand. I used two cans organic petite diced tomatoes and I omitted the celery. When I cooked the bacon, I had to drain it well when it was halfway done only because my bacon was really greasy. I tripled the garlic and because I wanted to keep the "beef" flavor throughout, I used beef stock and burgundy wine. After tasting it, I did add a sprinkling of brown sugar and I threw in a good amount more of basil and oregano. I didn't have the full hour to simmer, but I wish I had. It was pretty tasty anyhow, I served it over linguini that I tossed with a little EVOO and fresh grated parmesan and homemade rolls. Everyone enjoyed this meal, even my littlest! It's four and a half stars, really, because it does need the extra added basil, oregano and a little brown sugar. We all agreed that we can't ever go back to jarred spaghetti sauce, even if I do coupon well. This was just far superior to anything you can buy on the shelf in a jar.

Brilliant! I've made this with both white wine and red wine, although the red seems to give it more of a zing. Awesome!

This recipe was AMAZING!!! I took the advice of another review and cooked the bacon then removed it.  I then made the "mirepoix" (shredded carrots, chopped celery and onion) cooking it in the bacon fat.  When they were soft I then added the garlic, pork and beef, chicken broth and RED wine.  When the meat started browning I added the oregano (from the sprig) and the basil.  This was the most wonderful Bolognese sauce!!!  I served rice pasta with this meal.

Nice recipe!  I made it per the recipe and it came out pretty well.  I did substitute red wine for white because I only had red, and added some extra onions and celery because I had no carrots.  If I make it again, I will add a wee bit of sugar, a pinch of cayenne, and an extra clove of garlic, but otherwise this is a keeper!

It will be 5 star next time I make it. It was absolutely delicious. I had one problem and that was with the bacon, onion, and garlic. Problem was that even on medium heat the garlic and onion cooked up way faster than the bacon. So next time I am gonna get the bacon started a few minutes before I add the onion and garlic. I am thinking of using pancetta instead of the bacon as well. In place of the ground pork I used ground sweet/mild Italian sausage which was good. This sauce was good served over linguini. Very good!  We loved it!

Very yummy! I made this to go with lasagna and it turned out so good.  My Italian hubby always orders the bolognese lasagna at our favoirte fancy italian rest. we eat at and now I can make it for him.  I would so suggest to make the sause early on as the longer it simmers the better the flavor.

3.5 if you will.  This was a meaty dish.  I had no problems with it being runny.  As mentioned, I think the tomato sauce was meant to be tomato paste.

I thought this was a great recipe. Next time I think I'll add some parmesan. It was a bit on the acidic side, but still very delicious.  I also browned the bacon first, then cooked the onion, carrot and celery in the bacon grease. Then added the meat and garlic and followed the recipe. I also substituted crushed tomatoes, b/c my husband doesn't like chunks of tomato in his sauce. My 11 month old couldn't eat this fast enough. My husband and 4 year old liked it too. I really liked the subtle wine flavor. I'm sure it will taste even better on day 2...

First I cooked the bacon in a large pot and set it aside to drain on paper towels. Then I cooked the carrots, celery, and onion in the hot bacon drippings and then added the ground pork, ground beef, and the mushrooms and browned them. I drained off as much fat as I could and returned the bacon to the pot and added the rest of the ingredients. I used homemade chicken stock. I did add 4 cloves of minced garlic with the mushrooms. This was good but if I make it again I will add some tomato paste on top of the sauce because it was a bit watery and fresh herbs instead of the dried.  With these modifications I think it will be a 5 star recipe.

Thank you Kimber,  for giving me the basics for the best meat sauce recipe  I've prepared in 45 years of Italian cooking.  Tweaking helps take an already really great recipe and fine tune it to your taste buds! Like many other reviewers,  I  pan fried bacon and set aside.  Sauteed the mirepoix in bacon fat and olive oil until nearly roasted.  Minced 4,  (not 1)  fresh garlic cloves and added to beef and italian sausage as it was cooking in the mirepoix.  Definitely 6 oz. tomato paste; omit tomato sauce.  Used cabernet sauvignon and tore 8-10 fresh basil leaves in large pieces.  Added bacon last and simmered 2 hours.  Sserved over al dente linguine fini. 
BON APPETIT!!!

what a tasty change!  I did change this recipe up, so this review is more just for me:  didn't add the oil, didn't have the ground pork, did pasta sauce instead of tomatoes and sauce, didn't have wine to add, didn't add the oregano- forgot!  Was goooood, would make it my way again.

I really enjoyed this recipe....I did follow other reviews....instead of using tomato sause, I used tomato paste so the sause wasn't runny and doing so the consistency came out right.

Yet another satisfied customer.  Wow, what a great sauce.  My alterations were minor.  I used 3 cloves of garlic (put through a garlic press), not 1 and like many others, I used the 6 ounce can of Tomato PASTE, not sauce.  In what is probably considered sacrilege, I also melted in about 3/4 of a block of cream cheese after the sauce was finished cooking.  *heaven!* This makes a huge quantity of food and I took it to a potluck at work, expecting to bring home lots of it for lunches the rest of the week.  Bad plan.  The bowl was practically licked clean by the end of the day.  (Oh and by the way, I cooked just a pound of pasta at first, as the recipe calls for and it got completely lost in the sauce.  There was so much, it was swimming in it.  I cooked an additional half pound and even with the much, it was still VERY saucy.  The is enough sauce for 2 pounds of pasta, IMHO.

Delicious!  But takes a good 2 hours to complete.  Could use another clove or 2 of garlic.  Also sauce might be better a little thicker - add half and half?

Awesome!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, using one 6oz can of tomato paste and 15oz can of tomato sauce.  Also used Pinot Grigio, which made the sauce very sweet - might try a red next time.  My husband loved it 2 days in a row, and I even served leftovers to my parents, who raved as well.  Excellent sauce!

I loved this and so did all that had it with me. I did double the sauce and I cut up the bacon with kitchen shears and cooked it alone set aside and cooked the rest as was printed. I used crushed tomato's and the one's I buy say in puree so I didn't have a problem with the sauce being to thin. I used small can of paste instead of sauce. I think everyone will like this.

This is a favorite!  I added the celery with the onions/garlic/bacon (this took a long time to cook to crispy).  We used only beef (no pork) and I added some half n' half to cut the acid right before serving.  This is sooooo good, just my type of comfort food.

A local restaurant makes an awesome bolognese using ground filet mignon so I wanted to try to make something similar at home.  This recipe is a great start!  To save time, I left out the bacon, the pork,  the carrots.  That made it so easy to prepare and IT WAS FABULOUS!!!  I served it with penne pasta and fresh grated Parmesan on top.

Excellent recipe!  I did make some modifications.  I used ground turkey in place of the ground beef and turkey sausage in place of the pork.  Also added some roma tomato's as well as more tomato sauce.

Made this last night with just a couple of changes.  Used pancetta instead of bacon and mild Italian sausage for the pork. Also fine chopped the carrots and celery.  After cooking the pancetta I sauted the onion,garlic, celery, & carrots in pancetta grease then set it aside while I browned the burger and sausage in the same pan.  Then mixed all together with the wet ingredients and spices. Let it simmer for 2 1/2 hours.  Thought the oregano flavor was a little strong so added a bit more basil to counteract it. I also added a splash of EVOO during the simmer since I omitted it during the sauting. This is a fantastic bolognese!  My husband is not a big tomato sauce fan, but he loved this.  A must is to cook it for at least two hours to let all of the flavors blend together.

Thanks Kimbers for this base recipe. Although I found that the sauce (Italians call it gravy) was too thick. I made a number of changes to this recipe which required me to name the recipe as Bolognese Sauce II.

This was very good. I did take other reviewers' advice and increased the garlic to 3 cloves .  I also increased the oregano and basil.  I still felt that there was something missing, so that's why I'm not giving 5 stars.  There was a certain zest that was lacking that I look for in a great sauce, but I still haven't figured out what that is...

My husband absolutely loves this recipe. Of course I tweak it a little to fit our style- we like spicy foods so I add just a dash of red pepper flakes. Also I use ground turkey instead of beef (I have made it with beef also) and it turns out great! In fact I served it to some friends that never knew they were eating ground turkey! :) They just assumed it was beef.

My family liked this sauce. We've been looking for a great Bolognese for a while. This was flavorful and complex; overall, a nice change from the marinara that we usually have. I'll probably use it as a weekend recipe, though, as it was too labor-intensive for weeknights.

I ended up browning the meat and cooking the bacon and tossing everything in a slow cooker.  I also used 1/3 C red wine vs white and tomato paste vs the sauce and skipped the celery for personal taste.  Makes a hearty sauce for pasta, but will continue to look for something else.

This is a super great recipe! everyone that has tried it loves it. Bolognese is my husbands favorite and he is so happy to get it at home now instead of going to an expensive restaurant. I like to add Italian seasoning to the ground beef as I brown it. Very delicious and makes lots of left overs -even better the next day!

Very nice.  Followed instructions, except for using canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and replacing abt half the beef with left-over mince chicken from the freezer.  Came out to be a rather meaty type of sauce that's low on gravy.  Plenty left-over to freeze.  The next day added extra garlic, celery, onion, potatoes, chicken stock & cream to turn it into a nice stew (^_^)

This is the ho'made spaghetti sauce I have been searching for!  I love the idea of it having veggies in it.  My kids lapped it up, never knowing that it was better for them than the average spaghetti.

Wow was this delicious!  Prepared as directed, although I left out the mushrooms (I'm allergic).  Makes a lot - just the two of us, so will reheat for great leftovers this week.  Wonder if the flavor deepens over time, like cacciatore or minestrone?

I made this tonight and did not change a thing.  I thought it was great.  I cut the recipe in half (it's just me & my husband), and there's still plenty for another leftover dinner for us both.  
Surprisingly... my husband said he did NOT like the bacon!!!  Whaaat???  I disagree and will make it again WITH the bacon.  
I used baby bow-tie pasta (Barilla Piccolini).  Great recipe.  Would have been better with some grated parmesan!

I am giving this 4 stars because I felt that some things were very unnecessary, I think that the Carrots and Celery should be completely out of the ingredients, My husband is Italian and he was a bit confused about the veggies, it should be more of a meaty sauce and some what cheesy, But I did tweak some things instead of ground pork I put in Ground turkey to make it healthier and since I had already added veggies I also added baby broccoli to the mix, I also added bits of Gouda cheese then I let it simmer for an hour and it was GREAT!  So Yummy! I love that you can tweak somethings and they still come out so great!

This sauce got rave reviews in my house! I did a couple of small tweaks -- in that I took some advice from other reviewers and fried the bacon on it's own at first, then pan-fried the celery, onion, and carrot together in the bacon grease (so I omitted the olive oil completely). Then I followed the rest of the instructions, but added a splash of light cream after the sauce was finished simmering. It was delicious!

Very good recipe with only a few exceptions: 4 garlic cloves, 1/2 lb hot Ital sausage instead of ground pork, 6 oz can tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, 1 tsp each of basil & oregano, & 1/2 cup vodka instead of wine!

I agree with the reviews, particularly the suggestions to use fresh herbs, pancetta, extra garlic, liver, and saut√©ing the onions, garlic and carrots.  One more addition; I believe that classic Bolognese has fresh mint.  It sounds strange to the uninitiated but truly pumps the Quentin flavor.  Great recipe and reviews.

My husbad really liked this. I did use crushed tomatoes instead of plum because that's what i keep on hand. I also replaced the stock with milk and let that soak into just the meat because all the other recipes had milk and I like it that way.

Very tasty. Red wine worked just as well, since I did not have any white whine. Threw in a couple bay leaves, which rounded out the bolognese sauce, in addition to a dash of cream. Next time, I plan on throwing in the rest of the mushrooms for more veg. Thanks for the recipe! THis will be my favorite.

This sauce was AWESOME! My Husband and I loved it.  I left out the mushrooms, because we don't care for them.  The only other change I made was i took one turn of the pan with some balsamic vinegar.  That seemed to bring the whole sauce togehter.  Very nice recipe thank you!

Overall I really liked this recipe.  It was fun to make. I added more spices and garlic. First time around it came out kind of bland so I increased the oregano & basil. Also added a tsp of rosemary and 1/2 tsp of thyme and a bay leaf. Increased the garlic to 4 cloves. I also put it in my slow cooker on low for 8 hrs.  This allowed all the spices to thoroughly infuse throughout the whole sauce. Can't wait to try it again.

This had bacon in it, people, bacon‚Ä¶I expected that and the combination of beef and pork to make this the Bolognese that knocked my socks off.  Sadly, for us it did not measure up to my turkey Bolognese but is a decent sauce.

Sauce was very good.  I heard last night on MasterChef from Chef Gordon Ramsey that a Bolognese sauce should be cooked a minimum of 3 hours to even be good so next time I'll simmer this a lot longer and see if it makes a difference!

This was my first attempt to make a homemade sauce and it turned out well. The flavor was incredible! All of my friends raved about it but the consistency was a bit runny for me. I think my problem was I used a can of diced tomatoes (without draining) and I would probably try pureed next time for more of a sauce and not soup texture. Overall, great recipe!

This sauce was tasty, however, if I were to make it again I would omit the mushrooms and dice the carrots.  Having shredded carrots was distracting to the eye and not something you normally see in sauce.  The mushrooms are also not something you usually find in Bologese sauce.

Oh yes...OH YES!!!  Followed the suggestions of a couple of reviewers and sauteed bacon without the olive oil, removed it with a slotted spoon and set it aside til sauce was almost done.  Used ground venison instead of beef and used venison Italian sausage instead of ground pork.  Also followed another reviewer's observation about the tomato sauce should be tomato paste.  Added a large zucchini cut into chunks with the other veggies.  I'm sure the original recipe is fabulous as what I made was one of the best pasta sauces I've ever eaten.  It made enough for 12 servings easily and I froze the extra sauce to thaw and use on a future hectic night.  Kudos for a first class keeper recipe!!!

Really Good!  I used fresh herbs and the flavor was just as wonderful.  The next time I prepare this I'm going to fry the bacon and then add the onion and garlic.  A sprinkle of fresh grated parmesan is the perfect finishing touch.

This was a great sauce that my family loved!  I used prosciutto due to less fat.  I also sauteed all the vegetables than added them to the cooked meat & sauce.  I didn't have plum tomatoes so I used stewed tomatoes w/ seasonings & tomato paste.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Very good.  Used roasted (cooked in 400 degree oven with salt and pepper until they popped and then cooled and lightly mashed) cherry tomatoes from my plant in the garden instead of the canned grape tomatoes recommended by the author.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it.  It was so good even my kids raved.  I have tried other substitutions/variations to cut the fat and cholesterol some, but I prefer the original recipe.

The only thing I did different was add 2 extra cloves of garlic and another small can of tomato sauce.  I think this recipe needs some tomato paste, because it comes out a bit on the thin side, even after cooking for a long time.  It has tons of meat and stuff, just the actual tomato sauce part is thin.  This is the 2nd time I've made this (and the first time I made a note to add tomato sauce, hence the extra tomato sauce the second time around).  I'll add some tomato paste next time and see if that thickens up the sauce enough.  Overall pretty good though, Thanks!

The sauce just tasted meaty.  There wasn't really any other flavor to it.  The meat flavors were so overwhelming that I couldn't enjoy it.

Made it with my sister the day before yesterday for a company meal we had yesterday. It's very tasty and versatile. Add any vegetables and seasonings you want. We did use frozen vegetables and it already had plenty flavour; I can only imagine how tasty it would be with fresh ones... Yields exactly 9 twenty-something eaters.

Yum!!  I loved this and so did my family.  Except of course my 4 yr old who will not touch anything red.  I did make a few changes.  I left out the bacon, used a can of diced tomatoes, and a whole 15 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I used a little more wine too.  This recipe was very delicious.  I served it over rigatoni along with breadsticks.  I think though if you want 9 servings, you should probably make 1 1/2 times or double the recipe.

It was a great sauce. I simmered it for over and hour and it was perfect. A good quick one that you could use on any kind of pasta or even in a casserole.

Excellent.  Full of flavor. Easy to make.  I found that I missed the ability of tomato base to help hold the sauce together, but the taste ultimately won me over.  I left out the celery as its not something I keep in my fridge.  Freezes well.  Highly recommend.

Love this recipe. I made only one change and that was adding  1/2 lb ground veal which means adding a bit more sauce. I have made this a couple times and it is really very good.  As the recipe says fresh herbs are definitely better if you have them. I like to keep this on a very low heat for at least an hour or more. Thank you for this great addition to my weekend meal planning.

Wonderful recipe, third time making it and i still have yet to try it myself before its all gone. Family keeps eating it all on me. but like with most things i add a little something different. 
My family are all garlic lovers so i used about 3tbls of minced garlic and instead of the white wine i went with a merlot with a 12.5%alcohol. I just think red has more flavor.
Other then those two things i pretty much followed the recipe...might have been a little heavy handed on the spices but 1/2tsp i couldn't taste at all.
freezes very nicely for future dinners as well

Absolutely wonderful !!!!!!  Easy to make and taste's great.  I made this in my crockpot becuse it was easier than leaving it on the stove for an hour  and in the winter I enjoy smelling things cook in the crockpot for a few hours.  Thank You for the great recipe.

This sauce was SO GOOD!  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I, like a few others, did saute my onions and garlic in the bacon fat and it did add to the full flavor of this recipe.  Makes A LOT, so be ready to feed or freeze

This was one of the best that I have tried. It was so good that I canned up 14 quarts of it for the winter.

Instinctively I knew that I should cook the bacon before adding the onion, garlic, etc., but I thought I'd try it as directed. My instincts were right. It turned out OK anyway but the bacon never got brown.

Sauce was hearty, meaty, and relatively straightforward to make.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used tomato paste (6 oz.) instead of tomato sauce, which turned out really well.  I also used all the juice from the plum tomatoes.

Weird that I am giving this 5 stars - I don't know what I did wrong, but it came out awful!  Not being one to throw out that much food, I added a can of Campbell's beef broth and a can of Campbell's french onion soup, added some penne pasta and turned it into soup.  IT WAS SO GOOD!  So the lesson learned is that if you have Campbell's coup in your cupboard, you are the MacGiver of cooking!  
I will try this recipe again, though for sauce and keep my fingers crossed.

This was pretty hearty. I liked it but my family just thought it was ok. I didn't have a can of plum tomatoes or tomato sauce but I did have a 29 oz can of tomato puree which worked great. Also didn't use bacon - didn't have any. I also used beef broth and red wine instead of white wine/chicken broth - thought those would go better with the beef/pork mixture. I liked that there were lots of veggies in it - didn't have to make a side dish!

This sauce was... *miraculous*. I will be making this regularly from now on. A couple of changes I made: as another person mentioned, I cooked the bacon, removed, then saut√©ed the carrots, celery, onion until tender. Then I removed that and cooked the meat with the garlic. I also pur√©es the tomatoes because I‚Äôm not crazy about tomato chunks in sauce, and I also pur√©ed two fire-roasted, peeled red peppers. And I added 2 tbsp of grated Parmesan. Basically it was the best sauce I ever ate in my life.

Made this for a dinner party and followed the directions to the letter. Everyone loved it. Added some flour to help thicken the sauce. If I were to make it again I would not use bacon but replace it with more sausage.

Served with grilled Asparagus and garlic bread which worked out well.

After reading the reviews, I decided that I must make this and see how it turned out.  The only substitution in the beginning was to double the chicken broth because I didn't have any wine on hand and use tomato paste instead of sauce.  I did saute the Holy Trinity and garlic in the bacon grease and olive oil because that is essential in releasing the flavors of the carrots, onions and celery.  The sliced mushrooms were mixed in with the ground beef as it browned. I repeatedly tasted the sauce as it was cooking and found that it lacked something.  I added 3 additional whole cloves of garlic and a couple of beef bouillon cubes and it was still missing something.  Salt, garlic powder, two chicken bouillon cubes and it was still off.  Finally added about a 1/4 to a 1/3 cup of sugar in order stave off some of the bitterness and it was just what the sauce needed.  I also let the sauce simmer for about 4 hours to help the flavors to develop.  To finish it off, I added 1/4 cup of milk and fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  My kids raved and I enjoyed the finished product.  However, when making this, you must continually taste the sauce to see how it is progressing and make adjustments as necessary.  Thank you for the good base for our dinner tonight.

This is just delicious. A bit of a pain in the butt, but totally worth it. I used to just "wing it" when making bolognese, but not anymore-- this will be my go-to recipe from now on! I made a couple changes based on what I had - didn't have any mushrooms so I substituted diced green and red bell pepper, and I also didn't have any ground pork so it was all beef. And it still turned out fabulous!! Next time I will fry my bacon alone first, as other reviewers suggested, so it can get nice and crispy -- I couldn't get it crisped up enough with such a large amount of finely minced onion (I made a double batch, so it was a LOT of onion!). Oh, and I agree with another reviewer in thinking that the recipe must mean to call for tomato paste, not sauce, as sauce is not available in 6oz. cans. I initially added just the equivalent amount of sauce, but it didn't look quite right (too watery) so I added 2 cans of paste to the doubled recipe and it thickened up perfectly!

My husband and I loved this recipe. The only change I made was instead of plum tomatoes I used Victorias marinara sauce. Didnt have the plum tomatoes. Really good. We were looking at all restaurant and celebrity chef sites, but my husband found this one. Glad he did. :))))

This was the first time I made a Bolognese but it came out perfect. I didn't use the bacon...(I didn't have any) So I sauteed the veggies in tbsp of olive oil and a tbsp of butter. I added tbsp of sugar to cut the acidity and I used beef broth instead of chicken. It was a hit my daughter and husband loved it, she asked for it for lunch and dinner the next day. I will be making it again!

Excellent! I had to use mild Italian pork sausage as opposed to just straight pork sausage out of necessity, and I followed others suggestions and did the bacon first, then sauteed all the veggies in the drippings and used 6 oz tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  Still, even with these minor changes I would have never accomplished this without your original recipe. Thank you so much Kimber!

This is a very nice recipe.  It makes a generous amount.  The bacon adds a special flavor.  I will probably use more the next time!

This is the best sauce I've ever made!  I flavored the meats while I browned them with a little salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar and a bay leaf.  I thought there'd be a layer of grease on the top from the bacon grease but there wasn't.  I fried the bacon and removed it before adding to the sauce as per another member's suggestion.  Ab Fab, Darling!  Bravo!!

Taste was great but the texture was similar to chili. I will definitely try fresh spices instead of fried next time. Will definitely be making again with a few tweaks!

This is an excellent bolognese & we loved it.  I added a chopped green bell pepper during the initial cooking of the meats and increased the garlic pods to 6.  I also increased the tomato sauce to 15 oz, added a packet of Stevia to cut the acidity and a can of Cannellini beans for additional low glycemic fiber, plus it just tastes good too!  :)   I loved the taste of pork and ground beef in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

The flavor was good, but it was a bit more watery and chunky than I would have liked. I Liked the wine flavor however the young people in my family said it was not as good as the last bolognese recipe I made.  I probably will look for a thicker sauce style next time to please everybody.

Website not responding to my taps, so I didn‚Äôt really make this 71 times..this is my first time using this recipe as a guide. :-)
It‚Äôs still simmering, but I think it will be delicious and well-received!
The changes I made were to use what I had available and incorporated some of what others have mentioned as well as my experience with other Ragu ala Bolognese recipes.
I used pancetta bits instead of bacon, but next time I will chop it up fine with the garlic in a processor before browning it. After browning the pancetta, I saut√©ed the mirepouix til tender before adding the ground meats. After browning the meats, I added the herbs I had on hand...fresh rosemary, frozen fresh basil, dried oregano and dried parsley ( I prefer to use fresh Italian parsley, but had none on hand). I also added a little bit of pepperoncino flakes to give it a bit of heat. I used tomato pur√©e since I had no sauce available, and used considerably more as well as more chicken stock, as others have mentioned, to make sauce a bit looser. Since I had no dry white wine available, I used Marsala wine, remembering my chef uncle who used to like using that in his sauce. After simmering an hour, I added 1 cup of hot milk, let that reduce, then added another cup of hot milk to soften the acidity and give the sauce a more velvety taste.  Hmmm seems like a lot of changes now that I‚Äôm writing this. It could almost be another recipe!??
Looking forward to serving this and gobbling it up!

Tried several times to upl

So, I made a few changes to the recipe, as I was making a large batch for a dinner party.   I used an entire package of bacon (cooking it in a couple different batches) and saut√©ed it, then strained the grease into a saucepot (I didn't actually use the bacon meat in the sauce).  I saut√©ed the onions and garlic in the bacon grease, then added chopped celery and chopped carrots (not shredded).  After I added all the veggies, I added in 1.5 cups whole milk and cooked until it reached a simmer and some of it evaporated.  I eliminated the mushrooms and I used San Marzano crushed tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes.  I blended the tomatoes with some fresh herbs - parsley, basil and oregano.  I added that with tomato paste (instead of tomato sauce.  I also used about half as much chicken broth as the recipe calls for, as I didn't want to make the sauce too runny with the addition of milk.  I used about a tbsp. of brown sugar to offset the acidity from the wine.  I let it cook for about an hour, then let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The next day, I put into the crockpot and warmed for a big dinner party.  I did triple all the ingredients for a large group.  Everyone loved it!

I thought it needed a little more seasoning but that's why the directions state 'to taste'.

Great recipe. I screwed up on the tomato sauce and added one can versus 6oz. So, I simmered for two hours versus one. What a great recipe. Thank you!

The only ingredient change I made was subbing diced orange bell pepper for carrots; I also used 2 cloves of garlic - next time I may use 3.  As for prep, I cooked the bacon first then removed it with a slotted spoon and set aside - then cooked the onion, celery, bell pepper and garlic in the bacon drippings for a bit until they softened.  Then I added meats and browned.  I DO think they author meant tomato PASTE, not sauce...  it was quite watery.  Next time I will sub tomato paste to thicken it up - will probably have tomato sauce on hand if I need to thin it out a bit.  It was good and I like the fact that it doesn't have sugar in it (unlike jarred pasta sauce).  Overall, a great start :)

This was absolutely delicious.  I used a quart or so of freshly pureed tomatoes, a healthy amount of fresh herbs,  and used 1 lb. of Italian sausage pushed out of the casing..  The flavors blended so well  I did not use a lot of salt or pepper, nor other seasonings as I usually do.  We used leftover sauce on a pizza and it was great!  Definitely will make this again....may try adding zucchini as well

The sauce was too watery for me. I wish I had read more of the reviews because someone mentioned using paste. Maybe that would‚Äôve made it better but I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the flavor. Disappointed.

It definitely needed more garlic, I used 3 cloves. I left out the celery, it just doesnt belong in this sauce but the carrots really add great flavor. Saute the carrots and mushrooms before adding. Also, add the wine first to the browned meat and saute about 2 minutes to help scrape off the delicious bits of meat that are stuck to the bottom of the pan, then add everything else.

The recipe is basically a good recipe but lacks flavor. Next time I will use crushed Italian tomatoes and Italian sausage ( maybe hot sausage) and needs salt

A good basic recipe, I added more tomato sauce, 6 oz is just too little for me, I tripled it, plus I added a chopped zucchini instead of the mushrooms, which I didn't have.

Delicious!!!!!! I've made this recipe so many times. I've made it as is and doubled the recipe. Or you can make it with a variety of other likings. I always use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce but don't add it it until the end of the simmer. Then you can gauge how much that you actually need to your taste. I always saut√© the bacon or pancetta first (I usually use pancetta now) and I never make it crispy because I don't like the hard crispy meat in the sauce. Then I saut√© the vegetables in the bacon grease and a little olive oil or butter with the garlic. All the while I'm cooking up the other meat. I usually use a combination of ground sirloin, pork or Italian sausage and ground veal. They all taste wonderful but I think that I like it with the veal the best. I also am very generous with the fresh seasonings (not dried), garlic as well as a few shakes of crushed red pepper flakes. I've also used half chicken stock and half beef stock for the wine and is good too. The great thing about this recipe is that you can make many different variations to it depending on what you taste is and can't screw it up!! I always save smaller potions in food saver bags and freeze it. Yummy heated again. A terrific recipe that I'm thrilled that I found and tried. No plain red sauce ever again. I just made another double batch today.

A decent base for a great bolognese! It has a great flavour. We made just a few changes that remain in the spirit of the original recipe, which mostly consisted of increasing quantities. We used 2 lbs of mushrooms, 3 carrots, 6 celery stalks, and 1 head of garlic. Instead of ground pork, we used ground sausage for a bit more of the sausage flavour. Unfortunately, although we doubled the bacon, and cooked it separately as other reviewers suggested, we really still couldn't taste it. We used fresh herbs in doubled quantities and either should have used more  or should have added them in the last half hour of cooking, because my lovely fresh oregano was totally lost. We also added fresh tomatoes from the garden because we have oodles of them. Overall, this was a chunky sauce with a lot of texture and flavour ... and with our additional ingredients, we have lots of extra!

This was a really good sauce! I will definitely make it again! I did not have any ground sausage when I made this and I will make sure I do next time or at least use 2 pounds of ground beef. The tip about using fresh herbs was excellent! I cut a couple of fresh basil leaves and the flavor was wonderful! Very hearty!

This is a good recipe! It's an even better base recipe. There r so many different ways to make this dish. I prefer this one do to cooking time. I use 90% of  the listed ingredients but mix match others from different recipes. Instead of bacon I use prosciutto and pancheta.  Fresh herbs r always best also. I have my own wine to meat ratio which I found works best for my taste . Also I prefer cream in my bolognese sauce as well. With a few personal tweaks (as others have said ) u can customize this simple awesome recipe to your disired taste. Then u have your perfect meal. If u love to cook and make sauce...... this recipe is great !!! ????  Use the basics and tweak as u please. Hard to go wrong here no matter how basic some people think this is. You can tweak it into restaurant quality with ease.

This was an ok sauce but it is definitely not Bolognese. Marcella Hazan did that best (and Chef John of all recipes fame who uses pretty much her recipe) I did try this one because it was short cooking time, knowing it would be an ok version at best before I made it. Not worth the ingredients and time it took frankly. Back to the real deal.

I used pancetta instead of bacon, and a can of Rotelle (original) tomatoes with peppers instead of the tomato sauce.  Added some red pepper flakes to give it a little more of a kick.  Probably the best spaghetti sauce I ever made!

I forgot to add the heavy cream at the end and I would omit the bay leaves (I just didn't care for the taste of the spice).  I also used just  a pinch of the nutmeg.  I'm not sure I would use the nutmeg, but plan to make it again and make a few of my own tweaks.  Family LOVED it; I wasn't a huge fan, but if it pleases my family, it pleases me!

I was short for time so gave everything a quick cook in the wok, I added zucchini and a second clove of garlic. I threw it all in the pressure cooker but used a cup of stock as I didn't have wine. Also used tomato paste instead of sauce and two tins of diced tomatoes. Thought I put in too much Italian herbs, but it tasted great. Cooked it for 15 minutes in the pressure cooker and it was perfect. Definitely make again.

I only used the meat mixture and added two jars of my favorite spaghetti sauce. It is my families favorite now!

Very good recipe. I made a few changes: I used pancetta instead of bacon; browned the pancetta before adding the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery; Removed the veggies to brown the meat. Used 1lb. Ground beef and 1lb. Meatball/meatloaf mix (beef, pork, veal). After browning the meats, I drained most of the fat, and added the veggies back to the pot. Then I added the spices, increasing them all a bit, plus some red pepper flakes, fresh thyme, and fresh basil. Then I put in 2 28 oz. cans of San Marzano tomatoes (hand crushed), 6 oz. tomato paste, beef stock, and white wine. Simmered for 2 hours, and served with pasta, parmigiana reggiano, and fresh parsley. Delicious!!

To me this is a basic "meat sauce": yummy, but didn't stand out as extraordinary. My guests and husband really liked it, however. The only changes I made was to use fresh basil, canned diced tomatoes and we don't eat pork, so I only used ground beef. I'll make this again when my husband requests it.

This recipe is good, but needed more flavor. I added a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and a pinch of brown sugar. Next time I will probably use Italian pork sausage as the plain ground pork is pretty flavorless.

Made it exactly according to the recipe except I used 1 pound of beef and 1 pound of pork. Also, I used fresh basil and two more ounces of tomato sauce making one cup. Family absolutely loved it for Mother's Day. This is the second time I've made it and it was terrific. Way better than just some spaghetti sauce out of the canned mixed with some ground meat.

Sauce was excellent but, next time I will add more to make the sauce more "wet" it was too thick. I wound up adding it to a lasagna I made...wow...

Yum!  My husband can't stop raving about this sauce.  The only changes I made was to use plum tomatoes from the garden instead of canned, omitted the pork and used 1/2 the ground beef.  Just enough meat to add substance and extra flavor.  Doubled the recipe and froze a few quarts for later.

To be honest it was just alright. It smelled divine while it was cooking though.

I doubled the spices and the garlic as advised by other reviewers, but that didn't add as much flavour as I would have liked. To me it's a pretty average meat sauce, nothing to write home about flavour-wise. I had to add a bunch of cheese to add some zing to it, as it really seemed like it was missing something. 
I should add that it did taste better a couple of days later (still had to add cheese for make it yummy)

Fussy husband called it 'restaurant quality' and entire family agreed.  I omitted mushrooms and instead of l lb. of beef and 1/2 lb. of pork, I added only 1/2 lb beef and 1 lb. ground Italian sausage (1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet). Definitely a keeper recipe and will be making for dinner parties as well.  Thanks!

I absolutely loved this sauce, the only complaints I got were that the wine taste was very strong. I didn't think so, but I suppose I could have let it simmer a while longer. My advice: Prep in advance and let it simmer until dinner. It took me a little longer than the estimate time, but I loved it. Will be making again for the roommates!

Hearty but healthy! I didn't have bacon, but used ham I chunked up and fried up to crisp.  I also omitted the Italian sausage as I didn't have any and used ground beef rather than ground pork...again, because I had it! I added more spices...doubled the amounts suggested ...and thought the flavor was great!  Served ours over spaghetti squash and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese. Yum!

I sauteed 1/2 an onion which I later discarded with minced garlic and bacon strips.  

I left the bacon and fat in the pan.  I added a can of plain tomato sauce, salt, more garlic and grated cheese.  (add grated cheese to the sauce)  I also put 4 baby carrots in the sauce, but later discarded them.  I didn't add any more vegetables.

I browned the hamburger meat, drained the grease and added meat to the sauce.  It cooked on very low heat for 2 hours and tastes amazing.

I scooped out the sauce and tossed with angel hair spaghetti.  I will make again.

Great idea to add prosciutto but... I thought I had done something wrong because it was so incredibly dry. I did double the tomatoes and added the rest of the tomato paste. I then added 1/3 can of Prego sauce to make it less dense. The flavor was great.

This was my first time making homemade sauce.  I followed the directions with the exception of saute the "trinity" (celery, onions, and carrots) first before adding the meat.  I found the sauce to be runny.  I used a box of Pommo Italian tomatoes, and a 8oz can of Hunts tomato sauce pre-seasoned with Basil and Oregano.  I plan to revisit the prepared sauce again to try to thicken it up a bit.  I will try adding Catsup as one reviewer wrote and/or a can of tomato paste.  I will also try San Marzano tomatoes next time as well. Love them!

This is a very good recipe. Loved the celery in it. I doubled the recipe, tweeked it to my taste by adding 5 fresh red chili peppers, 1/2 tsp dried chili flakes and a bit of tomatoe paste. It was really really good! The white wine threw me, but I stayed the course and am so glad I did. My additions were just about the spice level, that's it! I will make this again for sure.
