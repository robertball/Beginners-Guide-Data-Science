The reason I'm writing a review is to tell other people who are unfamiliar with these cookies (like I was) to not be disheartened when they first look at the dough. The cookie does firm up after a day in the fridge and it does end up being a very tasty cookie. Although unusual. It is a no-bake cookie but in this case that doesn't mean it's not time consuming to prepare.

I have been looking for this recipe for years. I first came across it in a magazine in 1971. It called for crushed pecan shortbread cookies (Pecan Sandies) rather than graham crackers or vanilla wafers. Thank you!!

Love these! My Grandma has made these all my life and I look forward to them every year! Tip : Put the vanilla wafers in your food processor to grind them up... saves a lot of time. Also stick dough in the fridge for awhile then use a melon scoop and they are all the same size and your hands don't get as messy :)

I typically do not alter ingredients and then rate a recipe, but i just had to try adding 8 oz of cream cheese to this, and I am glad I did! Here is what I did.  ...I could not figure out for the life of me why in the world this recipe would need FOUR cups of conf. sugar, and then I figured the reason for that was because it had to sweeten the 6 oz of OJ concentrate.  So instead I only used about 3 oz OJ and only ONE cup of conf sugar and it turned out GREAT!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated, except I added 8 oz of room temp cream cheese.  These were also really good without the OJ in them, just the crushed cookies, cream cheese and the sugar...YUM! Next time I will make them like that and dip them into white chocolate.  Try adding cream cheese, you won't be sorry---just make sure it is room temperature so that it "folds" into the cookie crumb mixture well.

These are absolutely delicious!  I wanted to try something new for the holidays and boy am I glad that I did!  Easy to make (though it does take some time to crush up all those nilla wafers!!)  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a recipe from our childhoods-DH & I both remember these as Christmas cookies, but they make a great, cool, very sweet treat in the summer, too.  I use confectioners sugar and/or finely chopped pecans to roll them and chill the mixture, then use a small cookie scoop to form the balls.

I got an orange ball recipe many years ago from a co-worker and I lost it. I now use this recipe with a few modifications. I add the pecans to the rest of the mixture and then roll the balls in powdered sugar. After the balls have chilled, I roll in a second coating of powdered sugar. They are wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

Great cookies. I added 1 T orange extract, then added only enough concentrated orange juice to sufficiently moisten for easy handling. I mixed the pecans into the dough, eliminated the coconut, then rolled into balls and place on cooling racks. Let dry overnight, then drizzle with melted chocolate! before placing into tiny paper cups. Wow, my family loves these cookies. White, or milk chocolate may be used. I like them both. Yum...

Delicious.  First time I did as directed, but second time I forgot to put the butter in, and actually they did better, and I really like the taste better without the butter.  Thanks for a new Christmas tradition cookie here :).

This was so easy! One helpful hint-my grocery store does not carry  the small  6 oz cans of frozen OJ. I thawed the 12 oz OJ in the fridge and then measured out 3/4 c. of the concentrate. It mixed up just right!  I saved the remainder for a second batch.

These were just okay.  After the good reviews, I expected a great addition to my holiday cookie tray.  I hoped for more orange flavor, but found these orange balls to be a bit bland.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I chilled the dough before rolling it into balls, and the consistency was fine.  My son hates peacans and coconut, so I rolled some in graham cracker crumbs, too.  They are edible, but not spectacular enough to add to my list of Christmas recipes.

These are delicious.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  When I made my second batch, I used my grandmother's cooking secret -- I added a shot of brandy to the mixture.  The brandy enhances the flavor - myself, my family, and my friends loved them.

This is my great aunt Eleanor's recipe to the letter!  (Although back then it was just 'one box' of wafers, 'one box' of sugar).  It's so easy and tastes so yummy!  I've also tried rolling them in chocolate sprinkles as well, also good.

OH WOW! I'm glad I waited to review this....I tasted these right after making them and the orange flavor was a bit too much for me BUT then I tried another after sitting in the refrigerator overnight and it was PERFECT! So I would suggest preparing a day in advance for the ultimate results. I also would recomend letting the batter chill before forming into balls as they fall apart. The next time I make these I will also try coating these in a simple glaze instead of rolling in sugar or coconut.

My mom made this recipe when I was a little girl and totally forgot about it.  I loved it but she could never remember what I was talking about.  I was so excited to find this recipe and I'm glad I did.  I got carried away and acidentally added a 12oz can of OJ and had to scurry to make a double batch, lol.  I'm glad I did though b/c it went fast!

Sooo easy and sooo good! I have also made with following substitutions, which turned out to be a hit too :  use graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers, and use lemonade frozen concentrate...roll in powdered sugar. Plan on trying with frozen limeade too. great quick recipe!

This is a wonderful cookie.  My mom used to make these for us at Christmas and we just gobbled them up and now I make them for my family and have the same results, lol.  A great addition to a family tradition.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but they turned out super mushy and wouldn't solidify no matter what I tried.  They were also too sweet, even for me.

This probably comes from a bias of baked goods but I wanted a quick no-bake after another holiday recipe fell through. After a quick mix as (near) described, I found the consistency too wet ; pasty, and unable to set for shape.  I had too many other  products with nuts, so they were left out of this recipe.  And no a fan of coconut!  I threw orange cranberries into the the batter for a stronger hold and refrigerated.  
After the refrigeration it was more workable but still fudge-like in consistency and taste.  Since I had to "sell" these at a Christmas function, I renamed it as Sweet Orange Cranberry Fudge... and they did well !

We like it!   Prefer to just to use 2 packs of vanilla wafers and just enough juice concentrate to make the wafer crumbs stick into a dough.We also add some grated orange  rind in the mixture.    In our opinion,  the butter and nuts only block out  some of the orange flavor.  WE RESERVE THE POWDERED SUGAR AND ROLL THE BALLS IN IT.  Serve them n a bowl around a 1/2 orange.

Love this! These may be considered a holiday recipe, but they are also nice for a shower or tea...especially here in Texas where it is 110 degrees in September. They are refreshing and look really pretty in small mini paper cupcake cups. I mix all ingredients together and lightly dust with some powdered sugar once rolled into balls.
