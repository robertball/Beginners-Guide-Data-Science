This is my recipe, they changed it a little when they published it, I generally make a roux with the flour and oil in the pan, and a little broth if necessary (it eliminates clumpy flour).  As far as seasoning, I change out the season salt for garlic or onion powder, etc. based on the family's mood.  I also frequently add mushrooms or onions; I have served it over rice, pasta, egg noodles, potatoes; I adjust the liquid (wine/water/broth) depending on who's eating.  I think it's a good base to a quick easy meal you can adapt to you family's moods.

Not bad- but the flavor got old pretty fast. Adding the flour mixture caused lot of clumps which I had to strain out. I put it over bow ties which was a good way to mop up the sauce

This was pretty tasty. I did the chicken up my style (pounded thin) seasoned lightly with pepper and salt, quickly cooked it in a little olive oil and minced garlic. Pounded thin, it cooked in about 6 minutes. I removed the chicken and followed as recipe indicated. Then added the chicken back as recipe indicated, but only simmered for just a few minutes. I cut my cooking time in half by pounding the breads to about 1/2 inch thickness and we found it quite tasty. Nice sauce, easy to make and ingredients are always handy!

It's true, this is a great starter recipe which is why it deserves full marks.  After I initially cooked the chicken, I pulled them off and then put 3 T flour and 3 T butter in the pan.  After that was slightly browned and bubbly I whisked in the wine and water.  It wasn't clumpy at all.  In went a bunch of fresh rosemary, thyme and oregano, then the chicken.  Make sure you check your chicken!  That's why the recipe says "or until chicken is cooked through".  If it was overcooked, that's not the recipe's fault.  :)  15 more minutes is what it took for mine.

I liked this recipe a lot.  I took some advice from previous comments and decided to season the chicken really well.  I seasoned it before I fried it and than after.  My whole family loved it.

Lara, my family is in your debt!  We thought this was AWESOME!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for; it has a wonderful delicate flavor and is VERY EASY to prepare.  This is DEFINATELy in our regular rotation!  A green salad, maybe a loaf of bread and you're ready to go.

It was good, but perhaps needed something more. I'll make it again and experiment.
To solve the problem of the clumping flour, I added 1/3 of a cup of the hot broth to the flour mixture before adding it to the rest of the broth. Worked wonders - I had no problems.

I was going to make Angel Chicken from this website while visiting my Mom.  Then I discovered that she had no onion & Chive cream cheese, a key ingredient for that yummy recipe.  So, I hopped onto Allrecipes.com to find a recipe she had all of the ingredients for and up came Pan Sauce Chicken.  This was very good and pretty easy to make.  I will definately be making it again.  I will probably add some fresh garlic & mushrooms. Yum!

This was very good!  I omitted the 1/2 tsp salt and just used the 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, which was plenty.  I also added sliced mushrooms along with the chicken, removed them to make the sauce, then returned the chicken and mushrooms back into the pan.  We'll have this again!

We really enjoyed this (Husbot insisted that I write a review), and we already had all the ingredients on hand.  It was quick and easy.  I followed the recipe almost exactly - I didn't have any seasoned salt so I used some salt-free poultry seasoning and added a little more salt.  I served this atop some tomato basil fettucine but I think it would go better with egg noodles.  I am not sure about kid friendliness, I don't think our seven year old would have liked it but she wasn't here for dinner so five stars!

SO good and very easy.  

I made changes based on the reviews - used the flour and water mix but added some of the hot liquid into the bowl with the flour/water and whisked it together, then added it back into the pan.  I didn't have any problems with clumping.

I also added 3 whole garlic cloves  and juice from 1/2 lemon to the sauce prior to simmering.  I removed the cloves prior to serving.

Made enough sauce to serve over angel hair with a side of green beans.  Very good, healthy and simple!  Highly recommend for a weeknight meal.

This was very simple and quite good. It didn't taste low fat AT ALL. The sauce was very rich and perfect over seasoned rice and with some rolls. So tasty. I'll definitely be making this again.

Instead of using the flour and water, I used corn starch instead.  It didn't clump that way.

Eh, it was ok. I followed the directions exactly but I don't know. Seemed kind of bland, even served over buttery angel hair pasta with peas. Probably won't make again.

Wow. To find a dish low in fat and high in flavor is quite a task for me. I made this for my family and everyone loved it! I served it over fettucine noodles. The only thing I did differently was season the heck out of the chicken. I didn't measure the seasoning salt or pepper, I just sprinkled it on both sides. I used Mrs. Dash instead of regular salt, and also sprinkled on some poultry seasoning and paprika. For the herbs I used tarragon and parsley. This is definitely deserving of five stars. Thanks for sharing!

This chicken was delicious!!! My boyfriend said it's his new favorite chicken dish of mine.  I did omit the salt (I rarely use salt when I cook, though) and the seasoning.  I think I'll add some salt-substitute poultry seasoning like someone suggested next time.  I also threw in some oregano and rosemary, but I think I'll leave those out next time.  Other chicken dishes I've tried in the past have tasted too much like the white wine, but this was perfect!

Very tasty!  To keep the sauce from being lumpy, I put a tiny bit of chicken broth in the pan (about 1/8 of a cup), stirred in the flour which sort of made a roux, then added the rest of the broth and wine.  I also increased the broth to 1 1/2 cups and decreased the wine to 1/2 cup.  It made it more kid-friendly. I'd make this again.

An easy weekday dinner.  I served it over cappellini, which seemed to suit it.  It has a good flavor but perhaps needs something more...

This is a great classic recipe.  It is a great base from which you can personalize it to your taste.  I have to admit, I didn't measure when I added the seasoning.  I sprinkled the chicken with seasoned salt (no additional salt because it is not needed), black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little cayenne before browning.  Then I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken the sauce and I had no problem with lumps.  I used dried italian seasoning for the italian herbs.  If I make it again, I think it would be great to use fresh herbs.

Pretty amazing for being so simple. I only cooked and halved two breasts, with a little less wine and broth. I also didn't use seasoned salt cause I couldn't find mine. It turned out fantastic. I love that the ingredients are things you almost always have in your kitchen. Definitely making this again!

I used pork chops, cornstarch instead of flour (2tblspns), fresh garlic and mushrooms and also added lemon juice - DELICIOUS with these changes.

Very good base recipe.  Made it my own with semi sweet white wine, seasoned the chicken and the sauce with sea salt, pepper, thyme and rosemary.  Also added approximately 1/4 tsp of lemon zest to the sauce with the spices.  We will definitely have this again.

Easy recipe, average taste. can be kicked up a bit with garlic and lemon. I also used whole wheat flour and fat free broth for a healthier version. If you can put your own spin on this one its a great recipe to keep!!

My daughter said she would rate this 3 1/2 stars based on taste.  She thought the gravy had too much wine/herb flavor and would have preferred something more "chickeny".  However, I bumped my rating up to 4 stars because the recipe is so easy to make.  You do need to be careful to add the gravy/flour mixture very slowly and stir hard to prevent lumps.

This is fantastic!  Served with smashed potatoes and poured the yummy sauce over like gravy...tasty!  The only thing I added was crushed garlic. Also, I used Chardonnay as the wine. Don't know if that makes a difference or not. Can't wait to make again!

Love it, like the author says, if you read her "review" on the recipe, it is a base or starter, match it to what you want or are serving with it.

I made a roux instead of the flour/water mixture and added some garlic for more flavor.  With some small modifications, this is a keeper.

my husband loved this recipe.  It was just the tiniest bit bland for me (I LOVE spicy) and I could taste the raw flour.  I will definitely make it again but next time will prepare a roux to add to the sauce rather than the flour/water combo.  I know it adds some fat, but they say "fat is flavor"!  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

This recipe was wonderful, low-fat and easy. I omitted the salt and just used the seas. salt. I cut the chicken breasts into chicken fingers.  It cooked faster and it was very easy to serve over a bed of rice.

Delicious and simple. I used dried Italian herbs, and shook the 3 tbsp flour with 1/4 cup of water in an empty jar before adding to the skillet. The sauce thickened perfectly, and the leftovers were just as good reheated the next day and served over egg noodles.

A real family favorite, in my household. A did not have seasoning salt, as we are trying to cut down on sodium intake, so I added 1/2 teaspoon Mrs. Dash, with dashes of garlic and onion powder. It was delicious!

Excellent and easy. I did decrease the wine by 1/3c and added the same amt of water. I also added onion salt and garlic powder to the chicken before browing it. While the chicken was simmering I added approx. 1 to 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. This will become one of our regular dishes from now on!

Great chicken recipe.  My husband is not a big fan of chicken but he ended up bringing the leftovers of this to work the next day.  And he rarely brings lunch to work.  I pounded the chicken before cooking and seasoning, then simmered about 10 minutes.  Thanks Lara.

The flavor was delicious. I did end up with balls of flour like some other reviewers. I’ve made roux many times but always with butter and I don’t end up with lumps. I plan to make the roux the way I know how next time I make it. I won’t change anything else with the recipe.

This as a good basic recipe and like the original author, I made a roux. I saw no point in mixing the flour with water. Also, there is too much salt for us, so I reduced that considerably. I overcooked the chicken and that was my own fault, but 15-20 minutes after browning seems excessive. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will add more herbs and spices,  maybe onions and mushrooms.

This was a really tasty quick and good looking weeknight meal. My wife and her family loved it. I followed it pretty much to the T except I added mushrooms and a bit of cayenne pepper to spice it up. I'll be making this again for sure.

The only modification was that I added fresh garlic to the pan before adding the liquid mix and I skipped the salt and just used season salt like one person suggested (but imo that was to strong of season salt so i'll go back to original recipe next time).  I will be adding the flour  different next time as this method clumped up right away (even when I added some of the hot liquid to the mix before pouring it in)..next time i'll skip making it a paste and just slowly add flour to the simmering liquid while whisking it until it thickens into the sauce.  As for those that tenderize the breast first for quicker cooking (perhaps a good idea when dinner needs to be done quickly) but I think the 20-30 min simmer is what helps build the flavor into the chicken as well as allowing the juices to seep into the sauce during cooking.  For those that claimed this wasn't flavored enough perhaps adding fresh herbs might give it more umph vs dried herbs.

We loved this recipe! We don't drink alcohol, so I substituted an extra cup of chicken broth (so 2 total) and added a dash of apple cider vinegar. Very delicious! Also, remember to water down the sauce before storing in the fridge for leftovers, or else it will get thick and lumpy.

Had to share: I just figured out a good way to use frozen chicken breasts with this recipe:  When you saute the chicken in the first step, just use a little extra oil and cook the chicken all the way through to browned. Set chicken aside. Then make the sauce (you dont' have to simmer 30 minutes) and pour over the chicken. Delicious results in about the same total time!

This is a keeper.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only change I made was making the rouX in the pan instead of the flour water mixure. I served with mashed potatoes and fiddleheads and my husband took the leftovers in for lunch the next day. Thank you for a delicious dinner.

We thought it was OK. The sauce was a bit sour. My youngest daughter wouldn't eat it, me and my oldest daughter added some sweetener and found it OK that way, my hubby ate it but said it was just OK.

I always follow to a T and it turns out fantastic without any left overs!  This is quick and easy to make.  Great tasting moist chicken breast.  Outstanding recipe.

I probably would not make this again-it was not bad, but just tasteless, even after I made some minor changes to the recipe that added flavor- I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried italian herbs, seared it in a pan, made a roux, added the white wine, stock and some fresh garlic and fresh herbs...not only was the sauce a bland, unattractive color, it was totally bland in taste too...I am glad that I made the changes that I did or it would have been REALLY tasteless!!

As others mentioned, my flour/water mixture clumped up, and the cook time was far longer than needed so my chicken turned out a little tough. I will try it with a roux and shorter cook time next time, and rerate if it turns out better!

I had a problem with the flour mixture getting clumpy in the sauce and my chicken turned out a little tough, but the taste was very very yummy!

We liked it much better when we skipped the flour and water part and just did the seasoning. (There are times that I marinate the chicken in fat free italian dressing ahead of time also). I use Olive Oil for the browning, we love it. There are times that I cook the chicken in oil and do the deglazing/wine sauce at the end. Just don't like the flour, sorry.

A good basic recipe to know and edit to suit your tastes. I used a dry sherry and chose to thicken with cornstarch. Worked great. I'll be making this again.

Very good flavor and minimal work! I decreased the wine by half and made up the difference with extra broth, as I was serving this to kids and didn't want the flavor to be too strong. My only complaint was that the flour mixture lumped up and I had to strain most of it out the sauce, which subsequently didn't thicken up much. Otherwise it got good reviews all around. (The kids didn't love it, but they did eat it.) I served it over linguine with broccoli and toasted french bread. The pan sauce tasted great on the broccoli, too!

Did not enjoy this recipe.  The flavoring was a little bland.

We really enjoyed this recipe, it was fast and delicious. I cut the recipe in half but kept the amount of flour the same because it wasn't thick enough. I used herbs en provence in place of the italian seasoning and served it with plain white rice. Will definitely make it again.

This was not my favorite.  I will try again with less wine, onions, mushrooms, and garlic.  I think then it will be more to my liking.

This was so delicious! The flavors were wonderful and the chicken was moist and tender. I didn't have any white wine so I used white zin and it worked and was still yummy. I also added rosemary which gave it a wonderful fragrance. My fiance keeps begging me to make this one!

I scaled this for two people and made it for my fiance. He's really picky but he thought this was pretty good. I used Mrs. Dash instead of Italian Herbs because I didn't have any on hand and added just a touch of chili powder at the end. I served it over noodles, but will try rice next time.
