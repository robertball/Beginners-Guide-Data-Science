This was ok.  First, it took more like one hour before the pork was tender enough.  After only twenty five minutes it was like rubber.  And please, DON'T trim the fat!  That is what makes it so tender and moist!  Will stick to the classic Carnitas recipe.

We thought the orange was overpowering in this recipe. I don't think I will make this again. It was quick and easy to make but I would cut the OJ to 1 cup and use water or broth for the other cup.

Uck..Didn't quite taste like I thought it would. The orange flavor was very faint, almost like an after taste.. I'm not sure if the orange and the spices mixed well. Probably won't make again.
