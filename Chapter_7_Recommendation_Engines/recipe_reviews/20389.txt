Good recipe.  I used the canned pumpkin that already has spices and sugar in it.  I might add a bit more spice next time, but it was fine as is.  This recipe was good out of the oven but tasted MUCH better the next morning.  If I were to make it again I would allow at least 12 hours before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.

This is excellent!  I halved the recipe, used a French vanilla cake mix (Mmmm) and cinnamon instead of pie spice and left out the nuts.  Came out great, BUT---is even better the next day nuked in the microwave for about 30 seconds.  The top gets all gooey and moist and WOW, is it ever delicious...A must try!  I'm taking THIS to Thanksgiving!!!

This recipe is amazing.  My family loved it and I have some fussy eaters.  I didn't have some of the ingredients to make an actual pumpkin pie so we opted for this one and I am so glad that I did.  I think we all liked it better than pumpkin pie and it's so easy (my 3 year old helped make it)!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!  P.S. One change I did make was that I didn't have any pumpkin spice so I added A LOT of cinnamon probably about 2 Tbsp. if not more - I didn't measure, about 1 1/2 tsp. of ground all spice and about 1 1/2 tsp. of ground nutmeg

I make this every year for my friend's Fall Feast; leftovers never make it home.  My original recipe is very close to this one with some changes.  I use 1/4 cup melted butter in the crust. Substitute a can of pumpkin pie mix instead of pumpkin, eliminate the sugar and pumpkin pie spice, and use only 2 eggs in the mixture. The topping uses 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon / nutmeg to taste in the topping.  Turns out great every time!

I never thought I would say this--ever--but this was way too sweet. In fact, the sweetness overpowered the pumpkin taste. Maybe without the added sugar to the topping and cutting down on sugar in pumpkin filling would help.  If I make it again, I'll take the suggestion of another reviewer and double the pumpkin too.

This is excellent -- my kids love it!!  The next time I make it, I will add extra spice (a little bland) and will add a bit more brown sugar to the pumpkin mixture.  Definately a keeper!!

Oh my goodness. I didn't come in with the intention of making this one today, but had to try it. SO glad I did! This is a fantastic dessert - sort of like a cake bottom, pumpkin pie middle with a crumble topping. Everyone in the house loved it and requested that this be put on the repeat list!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I bet it would be great with some molasses as well.  (And, I made a mistake with the white sugar, and put it in the batter - it still turned out just fine!)  YUMMY!

My 3rd time making it, I keep tweaking it, because I didn't care for the spongy bottom-no flavor crust.  Also, the middle needs some more flavor.  So far, I have changed the bottom crust by adding 1/3 cup of brown sugar and half tsp vanilla, and only use the white of the egg.  It was too wet using the WHOLE egg.  This made a sugar cookie-like spreadable dough that you can easily spread with your fingers without being a sticky mess.  Second..I added a bit more spice to the pumpkin center and some cinnamon and a little extra brown sugar, a touch of vanilla and a dash of salt.  Third, the TOP crust...USE brown sugar instead....white...its much better, and be sure your butter is CHILLED.  If it doesn't come out crumbly enough..just add a little more brown sugar and flour.  Give it a try...maybe someone else can come with some ideas too, its a great base recipe!! thanks!

Pretty good recipe. However i would recommend you go light on the sugar in the pumpkin mixture. the cakemix + butter topping is very very rich, so it's best to go a little lighter on the pumpkin layer. Would have enjoyed more if the upper layer wasn't so sweet and buttery. Will pobably make again but try to lighten up the top layer.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe and now insists it must be made instead of our traditional Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. We couldn't stay out of it. Delicious and full of sweet decadence!

This is a nice change.  Next time I'll add ground cloves and a bit more sugar to the filling.  I used pecans instead of walnuts on half; the other half I left plain for those who can't eat nuts.  Nice when served cold with a generous squirt of real whipped topping!  :)  Thanks!

I have to give this one 5+ stars!  We love it and so did our guests.  I changed the walnuts to pecans as we have allergies but other that than, I followed the recipe to a T - much better in my opinion, than pumpkin pie.

This is absoultely delicious! After it cooled I tried a small piece and I wasn't overly impressed. I stuck it in the spare fridge out in the garage. I wasn't even sure if I should serve it or not on Thanksgiving. The next day I tried another small piece and I was dumbfounded. It was a whole different dessert. Straight out of the oven, the topping was all hard and crunchy. When I tried to cut it, it just sort cracked all over. Sitting overnight in the fridge totally improved the topping. It was one of the first to go on the dessert table. Thank you Bea!

Very good!  I took the advice from some of the other reviews, and DID NOT add the 1/2 cup of white sugar to the topping mix.  I had tried another recipe very much like this one before, and the added sugar made it too sweet.  There is enough sweetness already in the cake mix.  Also, remember to made sure the pumpkin is set.  You cannot nessessary assume it's done by the golden browness of the top.  Insert a butter knife or a toothpick in the center, and if it comes out clean, then it's done.

I didn't read all 140 reviews so if someone has already suggested this I'm sorry. Like other reviewers I added vanilla extract (a couple of dashes) to the crust and filling. I also added 1 pkg of jello pumpkin pudding, 1 dash nutmeg, 1 dash pumpkin pie spice, 1 dash ground cloves, and 1 dash powdered ginger. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar for topping. The key is letting it sit for a coupla hours. Don't serve just made. This is awesome & easy!!! Definitely could be made the day before and served at room temp. Thanks for the recipe!!!

My daughter and I made this tonight for a church supper.  I used the Libbys easy pumpkin pie, the one that already has the seasonings.  I omitted the brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice.  I only used 2 eggs and compeletly forgot about the milk.  Kept everything else the same.  This is sweet and very good!  Thanks for sharing!!

I made this for Thanksgiving, it was the most loved dessert.  
I used butter pecan cake mix instead of yellow and pecans instead of walnuts. Will make it every year now!

easy and delicious recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee, used canned pumpkin and added my own spices individually, because I ran out of a pumpkin pie spice. I agree with the other reviewers about it being on the sweet side, but I personally prefer my desserts to be a bit rich, (that way I feel satisfied with a bit less). If you are not into the sweet stuff, use less sugar. Using both the cake mix in addition to the white and brown sugars tends to lend a sweeter mixture. I took this to a gathering and one friend of ours actually had three huge pieces. everyone said they enjoyed it and I personally LOVED it. I will make this again every year. It is now a staple for my Fall desserts.

This dessert was excellent.  A nice alternative to pumpkin pie that adds a little pizzazz.  I added extra cinnamon, cloves and ginger as others had suggested.  Good idea.  I also also a bit more brown sugar as the pumpkin batter didn't seem sweet enough before I baked it.  Got raves reviews at family gathering.

It was a chilly day in the end of September and my pumpkin craving kicked in.  I did a quick search and this recipe looked pretty easy and sounded pretty good.  Lo and behold I had all the ingredients so I gave it a whirl.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly- with the exception I didn't have pumpkin pie spice.  So I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ginger, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg instead.  I also lack a pastry blender and food processor, so I mixed the crumble topping by hand (ie. with my bare hands). I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  I used Temp-tations ceramic bakeware, so my bake time was 65 minutes until the top looked nice and brown.  My grandma (the best dessert chef in the universe) is my main critic and after the first bite she said, "I need this recipe".  Success!  The family LOVED this dessert, and my husband (my 2nd best critic) said, "this is definitely a keeper".  I agree with the other reviewers that state this is better after a day in the fridge when all the flavors really set in.  Which is convenient, so I can make it a day in advance of a dinner party or pot luck. Positively delicious and I will ABSOLUTELY add this recipe to my recipe binder-- which is a collection of delicious recipes I give to newlyweds.  ;-)

Exceptionally good dessert! I was in the mood for something that was seasonally appropriate and this thoroughly satisfied my family's sweet tooth (even the picky ones).  I did make a few adjustments according to other reviews. I added vanilla into the yellow cake mix. I added nutmeg and about 1 cup brown sugar to the topping to avoid being bland as others stated. Omitted the walnuts because we do not care for them. Turned out spectacular! Tastes amazing the next day! Must keep for holiday gatherings!

I thought that we would really like this because my family loves pumpkin so much, but we didn't think it was all that great.

First we didn't care for the cake mix crust and second, we missed the more custard-like filling in pumpkin pie.  It tasted nice, but we just didn't care for the texture of the dessert.

It was fun to try but I won't make it again.

Okay, so I am going to do what I said I would NEVER do.. Tell you I loved the recipe , but made a change in it.. I only had a 15 ounce can of pumpkin and didn't want to drive to the store for just one thing, knowing I would buy more!! I used the can of pumpkin and added one 8 ounce package of 1/3 less fat cream cheese.. I also only had a box of white cake mix, so I added 2 teaspoons of REAL vanilla to the bottum layer ingredients.. It is wonderful.. Made it today, tried a small piece just a few minutes ago, and it tastes great.. I would make this again, the same way...

This recipe comes out perfect every time.  It serves more than a pie and it is a little sweeter.  This is a great addition to holiday get-togethers.

I made this recipe last evening for family, and they LOVED it.  Everyone said it was better than pumpkin pie.  I took the advice of others and added a little more brown sugar.  I also didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so used cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves.  It was wonderful.  My 3 year old daughter couldn't stop eating it.  I've already been "ordered" to bring this to Thanksgiving this year.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Oh My Gosh!!!  Thank you Bea for a different pumpkin dessert.  I went home for Thanksgiving to the VERY rural Jackson County, West Virginia.  
Normally my family likes my sweet potato pies...but my Brother had a serving of you Pumpkin Dessert and LOVED it...he insisted that I give his wife the recipe...the sweet potato pies I had brought as well were left in the fridge barely touched.

This recipe was the best I've made so far from all recipes. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It was a great change from traditional pumpkin pie. This recipe is a keeper! I wouldn't change a thing.

This was great, made it for an alternate Birthday Cake.  Read a lot of the reviews thanks so much it helped a lot.  A added to the amount of melted butter and to the chilled butter to get a better"crumb"  also cut back on the sugar for the crumb part. I used "Spice" cake and added additional spices to the mix like allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon.  I am definitely going to make this again, a huge hit.
Oh and I cooked it for 1 hour.

We loved this recipe! I made it for a potluck and all raved about it, including the kids. I read the other reviews and added a teaspoon more pumpkin pie spice and thought it was just right. I did find that baking time was a bit longer and baked for 1 hour instead. I will certainly make this again.

Was pretty good, but don't try to scimp on the sugar. I added another can (small can) of pumpkin and it was the perfect amount. The cake crust should have been thinner, but a nice change from regular pumpkin pie.

This was really good as is BUT I modified the recipe to the tastes of my family.  I left the crust the same, but in the filling I decreased the sugar to 5/16 cup (which turns out to be 5 tablespoons OR 1/4 plus 1 tablespoon) and left everything else the same.  In the topping I used margarine instead of butter, only 1/4 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and no nuts.  We thought the modified version was better because it was still rich, but not overly rich.  This makes a lot! We had 6 people at thanksgiving and we only ate about 1/4 of the cake!  I would recommend this, but perhaps thinks about modifying the sugar so that it isn't soooooo rich!  I didn't think it was bland at all.  It had the perfect amount of spice for me.  I will continue to make this!

I made this exactly as written except minus the nuts.  The pumpkin flavor is very similar to many other pumpkin dessert recipes, but the crust and topping give it a nice texture.

I was expecting something sweeter but with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or some whip cream on top the sweetness is just right.  Nonetheless I would consider adding more brown sugar next time. Even people who won't eat pumpkin pie had a bite of this and said they liked it.

Hmmm...I was SO excited to make this after reading the reviews, but was disappointed with the end result.  Seemed too "pumkin pie spicy" to me!  I used the Allrecipes recipe for Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Was that the problem?  Anyway, probably won't make again - sorry!  If you're trying to feed a crowd, the recipe makes quite a bit.

Yummy.  I made it for church refreshments and there wasn't any left!  One lady even told me that she doesn't like pumpkin, but could she have the recipe?  :)  I used pecans instead of walnuts and I did add a bit of cinnamon when I made the topping.

We've been making this dessert for about 5 years now but we called it Pumpkin Squares.  It's WONDERFUL.  In fact it's replaced the much loved pumpkin pie at our house.  My 10 year old son requests this dessert at every opportunity!

Delicious! I took this dessert to a potluck, where it got great reviews. I set the oven to 325° because my pan was dark stoneware. It took 75 minutes to bake, so next time I will bake it at 350°.

This is delicious!  My hubby loved it. I substituted the sugar on the topping with Splenda and it got a little soggy. Next time I'll just use regular sugar. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I made this recipe for a gathering at church. It was such a HIT! I added some cinnamon and sugar, and a little extra pumpkin pie spice. But it was absolutely delicious!!! I got asked by 3 different people for the recipe! Thank you for sharing!

This is awesome. Used French vanilla cake mix and instead of pumpkin spice mix used cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. For the topping I used coconut Palm suger instead white sugar and pecans instead of walnuts.
I would definitely bake this again.

Excellent. For those who don't want to make a pie crust this would be great for Thanksgiving. I served with whipped cream & was delicious. Pumpkin was firm to slice...see my photo, but still pie perfect filling. The only thing different; I used spices from Libby's Pumpkin pie recipe & mixed the nuts with the topping just before sprinkling on top & pressed in lightly. This way the nuts stick a bit better & become incorporated into the topping, with less falling away when cutting.

We had not yet had any pumpkin dessert for Christmas so I decided to try this recipe.  I made this recipe only sugar free.  I used a sugar free 16ounce yellow cake mix.  Changed all of the sugar to Splenda - in the pumpkin part I used a cup of Splenda and added a teaspoon of molasses to substitute for brown sugar.  I used 1/2 cup Splenda in the topping part.  I also changed the spice some for the pumpkin part to 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also used half and half instead of milk.  I then baked this until a knife came out clean in the center.  It was delicious!!  The only thing I would change next time is I would double the pumpkin mixture so that there is more pumpkin in the middle - with the original recipe there is only about 1/2 to 3/4 inch of pumpkin mixture and the cake mixture on the bottom was close to 1/2 thick - I wanted more pumpkin between the top and bottom layers -- will definitely make this again -- sugar free and with more pumpkin!!  I don't think I will make pumpkin pie again either -- I really like this as a great substitute for pie.

Pumpkin. First there's pumpkin pie then there's pumpkin cake and there's pumpkin bread . But none of that can get a hair close to this pumpkin dessert. And that is because it is sweeter, softer, and way more Fall-like. Take a bite of it , you'll be taking a bite of Fall.

I made this recipe today based on the amazing reviews!!  It turned out great.  Made it for a gathering and everyone loved it.  Nice with whip cream.  I used a yellow cake mix as thats all I had and it was fine.  I also used 3 T of pumpkin pie spice as I like alot of spice.  I found a recipe for the spice on line which was just fine.  Great recipe!

This was delicious! Thank-you for sharing Bea. My husband thinks it is better than pumpkin pie and I have to agree. I did substitute fresh pumpkin puree for canned this time. I used low fat sweetened condensed milk instead of plain milk. I left out 1/2 the sugar and two of the egg yolks in the pumpkin part. It was nice and light and fluffy.

This is cake is so good it is RIDICULOUS.  I didn't have much to make the topping, but I did have some cream cheese frosting, so I drizzled that over the top.  Seriously, I'd eat the whole thing if no one was watching.

It is really better than any pumpkin pie I have ever tasted. I will definitely make this for Thanksgiving and many more times. I used pecans and brown sugar as others suggested. Perfect.

Delicious! The only thing I would change is to add more topping. I think the next time I make it I will add a cup of flour and double the sugar and butter.

Really good. Brought it to a church function and got lots of compliments. It was the first time I made it and had to go get seconds before it was all gone. Definitely will make again. Yummy! (Note: I made without walnuts. Didn't have any. I also had to sub the pumpkin pie spice because I couldn't find it. Other than that, I followed the directions.)

I will be making this every year. It was a HUGE
hit with the whole family and there was nothing
left to take home. I made it the night before and
on Thanksgiving I served it at room temperature.
I did change two things. I put brown sugar instead
of white in the topping and pecans instead of walnuts. It was simply yummy...

This is better than pumpkin pie. When there is a potluck at work I take this and none comes home. I also chill and serve with cool whip I ran out of pumpkin pie spice and so I made my own from an online recipe It is much better than the store bought.

Wow this was amazing! I did not expect this dessert to be as great after reading a couple of reviews that had said this was better the day after. This was delicious though! The only thing I changed about this recipe was the topping. Rather than the white sugar I used raw sugar cane crystals. I used about 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. I added the raw sugar, remaining cake mix, butter, and chopped nuts to the food processor. This happened to crush down the walnuts even more, but the topping was wonderful! I also recommend this recipe for those who do not like traditional pie crusts too, like me! The bottom cake crust was a great idea! And the pumpkin filling was perfect! This deserves more than 5 stars!

This is a wonderful recipe! I used the pureed pulp from a peanut pumpkin that I had baked.  Since the pulp was a bit thinner than the canned pumpkin I added about a teaspoon of cornstarch.  I left the nuts off the top since I made this as a snack item for the children at the child care center  where I work.  I prepared two pans.  The children and staff really enjoyed the dessert.  Staff made copies of this recipe to make at home.  This was a great hit with all ages.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was easier to make than pumpkin pie (I always make homemade crust which is some work to make and roll out) and the flavour are similar. My guests asked for seconds and even someone who hates pumpkin ate it. i did add the same spices I put in my pumpkin pie (cinnamon, cloves, ginger) as I don't use pumplin pie spice.

I was worried at first by how "soupy" and thin it was when I put it in the oven, but it turned out WONDERFUL! Only changes: added a little vanilla to the crust, and used half white, half brown sugar in the topping.

Made this today. It got rave reviews! I substituted a half can of evaporated milk for the regular milk. And pecans for the walnuts. I mixed the pecans in with the topping. That made a nice candied nut! So GOOD!!!!

A tasty recipe that we enjoyed. It had a lot of kick to it from all the pumpkin pie spice. It was easy and inexpensive to make and was a nice welcome to fall.

Amazingly moist! I used sugar free cake, smart balance light, and Splenda to make it healthier.

I'm not a big pumpkin eater so this wasn't my favorite recipe.  I think I would have liked to have more 'crust'.  I also didn't put in it the refrigerator so it kind of fell apart and was mushy, but that was my own inexperience with pumpkin fillings and not the recipe.  I think I would try this again but with less pumpkin filling and more cake.

This recipe was excellent.  I took it to work and heard several people say it was the best pumpkin dessert they ever tasted.  I have made this for my family a couple of times and they all loved it.

I unfortunately didn't care for this.  It is like a dessert with an identity crisis!  Part cake, part pumpkin pie...I'd rather make both of those items separately, but each of really good quality.

I made this with spice cake mix and extra spices. It was very good, but keep thinking a crispier bottom would be better. Maybe a gingersnap crust. Anyway, it was an easy and good recipe.

Made this exactly according to the instruction.  However, realized after 20 minutes of baking that the dish of chopped walnuts was still sitting on the counter...totally forgot about them, but it was OK.  Will make this again, but it won't replace good old pumpkin pie!

SHOULD HAVE SIX STARS...........

Just tried this and LOVED it.Light and elegant tasting. Added 3 TBL. Pumpkin Pie spice rather than 2. It might have been kind of bland had I not added.

Just delish. Sending this link to everyone for a little Thanksgiving gift. THANKS BEA!!!

RE: DIABETICS, use Spenda rather than the white sugar. Only 1 cup of sugar in the whole recipe, and I think that's one reason it tastes great. Not TOO sweet, more like a souffle. An elegant tasting alternative to pie.

HIGH ALTITUDE: I live at about 7,500 feet and had to cook this twice as long to get the middle done. But.....it toasted the walnuts perfectly. Also glad I used a DEEP casserole dish or it would have been all over my oven.

Just a wonderful surprise, and I'll be using it THIS Thursday!!

Very tasty and easy to make, I couldn't find pumpkin pie spice so I made my own based on the pie recipe on the pumpkin can. Will have to play around with the spices. Would be good to have alternative to the pumpkin pie spice just in case.

These were easy to make and I followed other suggestions to use less sugar and use brown sugar instead of white sugar. The pumpkin filling was great but I was a little disappointed in the bottom cake crust - not enough flavor. I will make again and spice up the crust with more cinnamon and maybe even nuts on the bottom.

Agree with others who recommended adding vanilla extract to  cake layer and pumpkin layer. This recipe made 7 mini loaves.  Bake at 350 for 35 minutes.  Definitely better the next day!

The only thing I did to this recipe was add cinnamon (to taste). I used a 15 oz can of pumpkin puree (only cause I had it & wanted to make something ) and because of that I used 2 eggs instead & half of the milk.
i am certain that if I had followed the recipe the exact way it is, my desert would have turned out as wonderful as it did when I made it!! I LOVE IT!! 
ALL FIVE STARS!! Oh!! I used pecans instead of walnuts!!

This is a straight forward easy to make dessert. The first time I made it I followed the recipe as it was and it was good. Thereafter when I make this I only change one thing - use a spice cake instead of the yellow cake mix it calls for. I took this to a work party and received lots of compliments. My hubby even loves this and has made it for his office.  The first time I made this we didn't have Pumpkin Spice, so looked the recipe  up online and wa-la, we made our own Pumpkin Spice! We do use whipped cream or ice cream to accompany this dessert.

I followed the recipe exactly (except the walnuts) and it was delicious both warm and cold with or without whipped cream. I will make it again. It is a wonderful alternative to traditional pumpkin pie.

VERY good!  Our family loves pumpkin EVERYTHING and this is no exception.  We all prefer this over pumpkin pie!  It makes a large pan (great for potlucks or bigger crowds) but could easily be halved.
Do serve it warm with whipped cream.
I made this exactly as is with 2 exceptions:  
1.  Substituted pecans in place of walnuts
2.  Made a "from scratch" boxed cake mix to sub for the store-bought boxed cake mix (just not a fan of those).  Here is the recipe I used for the boxed cake mix substitute:
Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups (320 g) all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cup (300 g) sugar
4 tsp baking powder
1/4 cup (60 g) butter or vegetable shortening or margarine
1/3 tsp salt
Directions:
Sift all dry ingredients and put into food processor.  Add room temp butter/shortening and mix until the consistency of dry cake mix (a fine powder).  
Making this again, I will cut down on the butter in the topping (I had to mix a little extra flour to get the topping to a crumbly consistency mixing it in the food processor).  Also I will add more spices (pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg and cinnamon).

Oh my, this is so good!! Very rich and filling. I made it tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow (some reviews say it's better the next day, and I can't wait!), and I couldn't resist and had a tiny bite. Delicious! At first I thought the cake mix wouldn't fill the bottom of a 9x13 aluminum disposable pan, but I decided to use my hands and spread it around and mash it down rather than a spatula or spoon, and it worked like a charm. The cake mix is more like a dough than batter, so if yours looks like a dough ball, it's perfect. I don't have a pastry blender, and my trusty food processor decided to die the night before Thanksgiving (go figure), so for the cake mix/sugar/butter topping I cut it with a fork and then used my hands (again) to kind of mush it all together. My house smells amazing, and this is absolutely a dessert that I will be making again and again. (I also omitted the nuts, we're not big fans). Perfect!! *UPDATE*  Yep, even better the next day. Put it in the microwave for 30 seconds.. Perfection!

I made it twice, the first time exactly as the recipe and the second with two variations.  The variations were my usual pumpkin pie spices instead of pumpkin pie spice and the second was pecans instead of walnuts.  This recipe using pumpkin pie spice and walnuts was far superior and highly recommended.  My guests raved about it!

Very good.  I used half the amount if white sugar for the topping, and it turned out perfect. I probably should’ve cooked it for another five minutes. Next time, I think I’ll try and bake the crust a bit before adding the rest of the layers, to crisp it up a bit.

Comes out with a burnt crust both times I made it and has a very dull sweet flavor for the pumpkin layer.

This recipe was easy to make with ingredients I had on hand.  I took it to a church function and everyone loved it. The only change I made was to substitute 4 cups of squash for the canned pumpkin.

I made this for a get together and everyone loved it! I left out the nuts due to allergies. When mixing the crumble topping, make sure not to over mix or you’ll get a doughy mess.

I didn't have a couple of the ingredients that was in the recipe, so I substituted it. Basically, I had leftover pumpkin pie filling that I didn't want to throw it out, and it was already mixed too. I didn't have yellow cake mix, so I ended up using white cake mix. I couldn't find all my pumpkin spices, so I only used cinnamon. I guessed with out the pumpkin pie spices you can't really smell the pumpkin aroma. I did use less sugar than the amount in the recipe. Good with morning coffee like coffee cake. For dessert maybe serve with whip cream or ice cream. I'll have to make it again with all the right ingredients. The recipe was easy to follow and easy to make. Everyone loved it!

this is very good, easy to prepare, and I even had someone comment that they don't like pumpkin pie(mostly d/t the consistency) but loved this.  I followed the recipe as written, except I tasted the pumpkin batter before baking.  It seemed bland. it was perfectly spiced but somehow was bland, and then I realized that it lacked SALT. there is no salt listed in the ingredients for the pumpkin mixture. It definitely needs salt in order to enhance the other flavors. I recall reading several state that there is discrepancy between the amt. of sweet/not sweet depending on the layer.  I think the salt helps to tie it all together and therefore, consistently was a nice dessert that I feel, was not sickening sweet.  trick is to add some salt, not add more sugar or spice.  this is great to take to potlucks.

Will absolutely make it again!   The only thing I added was a healthy sprinkling of chocolate chips on top and spread them with my short offset spatchula (as they melted from the residual heat).  The pan was empty in no time as my family strolled through the kitchen and cut  themselves "just one more square".....yummmmmm!

It was very tasty, but the recipe was not well written. The top crumble was more of a paste that splashed into the pumpkin mix.

Excellent recipe. I didn't have a yellow cake mix, so I used white instead and baked a real pumpkin and used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. It turned out excellent. Thank you for this great pumpkin dessert recipe. It's a keeper. I'm gong to make it again for Thanksgiving.

I made it exactly like the recipe. I made it to take to a Church function and received lots of compliments and even had someone want the recipe! The best part is that it's super easy!! Will make again !!

I made it low sugar and low fat and it was still a hit!  
I used half Splenda and half sugar.  I also used half the butter and half apple sauce. (top layer I used the sugar and butter). It turned out delicious and my guests loved it!

I added more spice as recommended by a comment and also left out the sugar on the topping. By leaving out the sugar it wasn't sweet enough unless there was cream on top. Also, I added brown sugar instead of white and the pumpkin turned brown. The cake part on the bottom was odd. This tasted pretty good, but I won't make it again.

This got raves when i served it at my Circle meeting.  Can't give it 5 stars because it took an hour to bake.  I carefully read all the reviews and made some changes accordingly. Probably not fair to review it since I made so many changes.  Crust: used 1/4 c butter, egg white only, added 1/3 c light brown sugar, 1/2 teas vanilla.  Was not easily spreadable, so next time I will try the whole egg and 1/3 c butter.  Pumpkin layer:  used 30 oz can pumpkin pie mix and 2 eggs.  Top layer I mixed all this together, including the nuts:  reserved cake mix, 1/4 c chilled butter, 1/4 c sugar, 1/8 c light brown sugar, 1/4 c regular oatmeal, 1/8 teas  cinnamon, 1/8 teas nutmeg, 1/2 c chopped walnuts.  Baked for one hour.  Made it the night before and put in fridge overnight.  It is pie consistency, so needs forks.

I made it for a Pot Luck and found it delicious, as did everybody else who was fortunate enough to get some.  I used cinnamon and allspice, which is what I had and pecans since I couldn't find my walnuts.  Can't imagine any improvement  over time but perhaps I'll have some left over next time and will find out the next day.

Truly delightful!  Wanted to make it a bit healthier, so I used coconut oil instead of butter in the bottom layer, reduced brown sugar by about 1/2 by not packing, replaced milk with unsweetened almond/cashew blend and reduced white sugar by 1/2 in top layer.  instead of pumpkin spice (didn't have), I used 2t cinnamon, 1 1/2 t ginger and 1 t ground cloves.  Delicious!  I will not have to worry about being left home alone with the leftovers because there won't be any!  Love it, thank you!

This recipe is easy to make and delicious!! My kids don't like pie crust but love pumpkin pie so this was a great alternative for us.  Very easy to make. This was gone in a matter of days and there was a fight over the last piece! Only change we changed was to leave out the nuts (picky eaters at our house).

This is truly amazing! I only used brown sugar and even cut that in half, and was still plenty sweet. I also added cinnamon to all three layers with little vanilla to each. Mine was done in 45 minutes. I promise this will be made many more times!! Thank you, thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was a winner as written. I've tried similar recipes, but everyone agreed they liked the fact that there was a "crust" on the bottom.

Sorry I made it and won't try it again as this is a recipe not worth repeating. Parts are too sweet, others not sweet enough... It is better after sitting overnight but not by much. It's this weird hybrid thing that doesn't really fit into any category, succeed in soothing any craving you might be having. It's not pumpkiny enough to satisfy if you're craving pumpkin pie, it's not sweet enough if you're craving sugar, it's not savory, hearty, homemade enough. It's not warm enough, cold enough... More than what it is, is all that it's not. About the only thing this recipe is, is easy.

This got great reviews from everybody at our BBQ that had this. I went scant on the sugar in the topping and in the pumpkin layer. I think I might have gone a little too scant in the pumpkin layer, so next time I think I'll just put in the normal amount of sugar in the pumpkin and skimp on the topping. Strangely, the next day, it tasted just right. Good hot or cold!

I didn't have a yellow cake mix, only chocolate. I love chocolate and pumpkin together in other recipes so I thought this was worth a try with the chocolate cake mix. It tasted delicious! And I just put the nuts in with the other topping ingredients to save myself a step.

This is very good.  My only suggestion is to make sure the cake mix is down into the butter or the pumpkin mixture because some of mine was not and I had cake mix powder on top after it was baked.  Other than that it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again because it is very quick and easy!!!

This is a dessert with an identity crisis lol. Overall, It was enjoyable but there seemed a bit much all over going on. The top turned out to be way to sweet and buttery for me and retracted from the pumpkin filling flavor which the filling at the same time seemed to be missing something. The bottom crust for me never firmed up much. The over all bite just confuses the taste buds. Maybe forget the crumb topping (or go with a recipe for cobbler topping without cake mix) and maybe spread a thing layer of whipped cream once it's cooled.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it is delicious. Like many other reviewers have said, even better the next day! Next time I will try to cut back on the sugar to reduce calories. My husband likes it better than pumpkin pie.

Fantastic! Made the recipe exactly as listed.  Tastes the best cold after sitting in the fridge overnight and add a dollop of whip cream. So, the 2nd time I purposely made it the night before & served it at Thanksgiving with whip cream.  Everyone loved it.

I don't think I'll ever go back to a basic pumpkin pie again after trying this recipe!  While I made a few tweaks (i.e. made more of a true pumpkin pie filling by following the directions on a can of pumpkin), the concept of yellow cake mix as the crust is brilliant.  My VERY picky 6 y/o couldn't get enough of this dessert.  I made it for Thanksgiving and will be making it again for Christmas.

This recipe has a great taste but the filling was a little loose for my taste. I will give this one another try but without the milk.

You can use white cake mix too. Better if left sit in the fridge for a day. It is plenty sweet.

Excellent and easy desert.  Make a day ahead to allow flavors to meld. Delicious w/ both ice cream or whipped cream topper.

One of the best desserts I have made from this site. VERY easy. I followed the recipe exactly. No changes necessary - this was SO good. The house smelled amazing when it was baking too. I couldn't wait to try it! The only problem was that I could not find an 18.25 box of cake mix. I could only find 16.5 but it still worked out fine. One reviewer found this to be too sweet but I did not think that at all. It was delicious.

Doubt I will be making plain pumpkin pie again! This is a phenomenal recipe! I used a 1/2 the sugar yellow cake mix, I did follow advice of other users and use brown sugar instead of white in the topping, and also used 1/2 cup oatmeal instead of nuts due to allergies. AMAZING! Whole family loved it!!!!

This is yummy and easy to make.  I suggest letting sit overnight in fridge brings out all the flavours.  Add whip cream, gives it yet another dimension.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  It was simple to make and I already had most of the ingredients in the house.  It was simple to make but doesn't taste like it.  My fiance was still talking about how good it was the next morning.  I didn't add the nuts to the top since my fiance doesn't like them but otherwise made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  Will definitely be making this again when my whole family comes out for Christmas.  When you make a pumpkin pie it only serves a few but this dessert will serve many more with even better flavor.  Great job!

All the Non-Pumpkin pie lovers at work loved this. I even got asked to make it again a month later for the next pot luck.    I used pumpkn pie dry pudding mix instead of pumpkin pie spice in the filling. This is usually only available around the holidays though.  Adds good texture and flavor.  I've also made it using half of a spice cake mix instead of vanilla.

I wasn't crazy about this desert. I was expecting more of a layered desert, but it ended up with all the ingredients just running together during baking. It was rather dense and the flavors just didn't quite work for me. Don't think I'll be trying this one again.

I would really give this recipe 3.5 stars.  It's a good recipe and everyone liked it at the party I made it for, but I think it could be a little more flavorful.  I'm not sure what to add to it, though, for that extra umph.  :)

This was not good to me. I thought the bottom crust was dry and the filling was bland. I also felt like the top should have more crumbs. I did everything according to the recipe. I will not make again sorry it just was not what I was expecting.

Served with ice cream, this dessert was decadent & delicious! Mine turned out a tad mushy (the pumpkin layer). No one else commented on this so I may have done something wrong but next time I am going to make it with 1/2 a cup of milk instead of 2/3. It really does serve 18 because it is so heavy.

I made this recipe thinking that it would be a nice dessert.  Its good, but it tastes like a coffee cake not like a sweet dessert.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  Next time I may make a few changes.

Fabulous dessert!  Very easy to make and way better than pie.  We used fresh pecans instead of walnuts and cooked it slightly longer than suggested.  Great cold!

Wow! I decided to try this for my Thanksgiving guests in place of pumpkin pie and my guests LOVED it and wanted the recipe to use instead of pie for now on.  This was an incredible dessert.  I don't like pumpkin pie and I even liked this dessert because it was enough pumpkin to be velvety but the crumb topping and cake-like bottom gave a nice change in texture.  Even if your not fond of pumpkin, I recommend giving this one a try.  Thanks for sharing :)

This was way too good, and I ate way too much of it. I agree with other reviewers that the flavor incorporates nicely if let sit overnight and refrigerating it makes it taste great- although it tastes good hot and at room temperature too...lol.

Excellent recipe!  I used Pillsbury's Moist Supreme Classic Yellow (pudding in the mix) and Pumpkin Pie Spice I from this site.  Took it to a church Oktoberfest potluck with a can of whipped cream.  Out of a table of desserts, this was the first one gone.  I've been asked to bring it to our Thanksgiving celebration.  Probably should make two.

YUM! I brought this to work and it was gone within an hour. A nice change from pumpkin pie. My only comment/complaint is that I felt the 'crust' needs something, maybe some finely crushed nuts for texture, it seemed kinda blah. Other than that, excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good recipe. It did have a few more steps than I anticipated but worth it.  I think I will bring this to Thanksgiving dinner.  It is a nice change from pumpkin pie.

I got very positive feedback.  I added more sugar than the recipe called for.  Someone said it was better than pumpkin pie!

Much tastier than the last pumpkin recipe I tried from here.  I would cook it a few minutes longer.  My pumpkin was not very firm and the topping a bit battery underneath.  I halved this recipe since it was only for my husband and myself.

No one in my family likes pumpking, but they still ate this custard-style dessert. I took it to a dinner party, and the pumpking fans ate it up. I would suggest adding some cloves and cinnamon to the pumpkin layer; overall, this was very good, although not quite sweet enough.

I had been looking for a good dessert recipe using pumpkin, staying away from crust with shortening in it, and I came upon this recipe. We (husband, son, and myself) all loved it! It is great eating it hot or cold, and it is a pleasant change from eating pumpkin pie. Thank you for posting it on allrecipes.com!
