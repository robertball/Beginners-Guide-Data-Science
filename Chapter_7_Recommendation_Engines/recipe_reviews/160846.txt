I found this bland and tasteless.  It was a buttermilk biscuit.  I even used cinnamon sugar on top instead of plain cinnamon.  It didn't help much.  I know scones are not supposed to be sweet, but this didn't make the cut.

I added 1/3 c. sugar and about 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the recipe.  Baked up sweet and soft, excellent breakfast scones!  Will be trying them with blueberries next time!

Great taste but they fall apart while eating.

Bland. Would definitely add more butter and sugar.

I'm always looking for new scone recipes most have been good. This one is the worse recipe I have ever made. I took advise and and added sugar and cinnamon to the batter. These are biscuits the texture is chewy, bland and is not a scone. Every Xmas I make 6-8 different cookies, candy and the scones. This yr there will be no scones.

I added some sugar to dough as well as cinnomon and sugar on top. These could also be made savory by leaving off cinnamon and maybe adding cheese, meats.. and spices.

Adding the sugar took these from a 3 star recipe to a 4 star plus

I used tiny tea cookie cutters for my daughters Peter rabbit tea. She’s o let in 2nd grade so they don’t need much. I was confused by the “sprinkle cinnamon” part, so i improvised and made cinnamon sugar and drenched the top of them with that. They are tiny and delicious and sure to be a hit with the kids tomorrow!

I should have read the recipe and reviews more closely before diving into making these. These are not scones. They're biscuits. I made some changes on the fly to make them more scone-like (I put cinnamon and sugar in the dough and hand formed the dough and cut into triangles instead of rolling and using a round cutter) and they were passable. But next time I make scones, I'll make sure I actually find a scone recipe.
