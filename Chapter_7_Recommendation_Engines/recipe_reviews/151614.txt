My family and I love this recipe - with some additions.  I usually add sauteed onions, 1 tsp each of garlic powder, chili powder and black pepper and 4 Tbsp of soy sauce.  Very easy and quick dinner with ingredients I usually have on hand.  Reheats well too.

This is pretty good, a nice once-a-month quick easy meal for my family.  I like to put Onion and/or Garlic Powder in this to give it a little added flavor

This is good for what it is; I'm eating a bowl of leftover cheeseburger pasta right now.  It is very mild and something children would probably enjoy, but to add flavor, you need to make some changes.  First, I browned the meat with cayenne pepper, crushed pepper flakes, and minced garlic.  I also used milk instead of water to make it more creamy, and I mixed in a handful of shredded medium Cheddar.  I added a few dashes of Tobasco to the soup mix, and you'll likely want some salt and perhaps black pepper to taste.  I top my individual serving with more shredded cheese.  I also used egg noodles.  Even with all those additions, it still tastes pretty mild to me, but it's good and simple when you don't have much energy for cooking a big meal.  Consider the audience, definitely; over on Campbell's website, this recipe gets pretty good reviews all around.

We absolutely loved this!  I used ground turkey instead of hamburger.  I cooked my meat then added some chopped fresh onion and garlic, then my soups. I needed just about 1 3/4 cups water for my noodles to cook.  I also added pepper, onion powder and garlic powder as the noodles were cooking.  Served with steamed broccoli/cauliflower.  Will be making this again soon!

eh, nothing special.  My mom's goulash is much better and if I want something quick and easy I'll just purchase the hamburger helper version instead....cheddar cheese soup cost $2 by itself!

This is even better if you sautee some onion and garlic and add a cup or so of shredded cheddar. I serve this with a good crusty bread.

Sure, it's not anything gourmet.  But it is kid friendly, quick, easy and economical.  I make it about once a month.  I don't think it needs anything else, although I always season my ground beef with garlic powder, garlic salt and onion.

This is so good. Not a fan of all the preservatives hamburger helper adds so i feel this is a much better way to get that quickness of h.h w/out the chemicals. Tastes even better!!! I'm making this tonight for a quick "back-to-school" night dinner. I'm actually looking for more recipes like this.

I would personally give this a 3.5 Me and my fiance are getting out first place together and I was looking for a couple of good cheap recipes. I'm sure we'll use this one every now and then. I added 2 handfuls of colby jack cheese, and used milk instead of water. I also used a whole lb box of noodles. In the end it still turned out really creamy even though I used the same amount of sauce. It has an interesting flavor and although I despise tomato soup this was pretty good. Quick too, only takes about 15 min or less.

I found this recipe on a can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup.  That recipe calls for a can of Beef Broth instead of Tomato Soup.  Also, look online for a recipe for making your own Cheddar Cheese Soup...cheaper.

I didn't have any tomato soup so I used a small can of tomato sauce and a can of drained diced tomatoes. Still turned out pretty yummy. Might add a little seasoning to it but otherwise good. Very easy and quick!

The recipe itself is very basic. It makes a good starting point for additions. (Hence, 3 stars). But once you add in some other stuff - garlic powder, onions, milk as some other members have suggested - and/or tomatoes like I did, and the recipe becomes 4 or even 5 star material.

If you want a cheap, quick, and easy meal, this is it. I made the version on the back of of a soup can that called for beef broth and ketchup. The sauce was a little thin, but nothing a little flour can't fix!

this one is pretty bland but i should have expected it given the ingredient list.  this is not gourmet cooking by any strech but i needed something quick and easy so i tried it.  i dont think i'll make it again, it's glorified semi-homemade hamburger helper...and maybe even not as good!

I made this last night, and we all liked it! I did take the advise and added more tomato soup and pasta. I kept wanting to add normal "spaghetti sauce" ingredients, but I didn't because if I wanted spaghetti I would have made that! But we liked the creamy thick texture that it made.

You need to add more water than what the recipe calls for. Basically tasted like Hamburger Helper. Added some garlic and shredded cheese to spruce it up a bit.

My family and I really enjoyed this. I crock potted my meal. I let the hamburger cook in the crock pot, then drained fat, added the soup and water, then the noodles the last 30 minutes ( I also used egg noodles) and then threw in some shredded cheese. Will make again on a busy day.

Tasted like a big bowl of nothing, even after I added chili powder and garlic powder. The cheese soup didn't add a cheese taste so much as an unidentifiable "huh?" taste that I didn't like. Won't make again.

I liked this recipe. I do agree that it needs a little something extra. I added a handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese while it cooked. This made it tastier and thicker, which I preferred.

everybody loves this and it's so much better than the boxed stuff. I add a little onion, garlic, basil and oregano. if I have velvita I will add a little of that too. I've tried diced tomatoes in it also.  I also do vegi noodles so I can sneak more vegis into the kids diet.  all are great to an already great recipe. thanks for the yummy goodness.

After adding the seasonings and cheddar as suggested by Jenny, this recipe produced a very tasty, cheesy "beef-a-roni."  I'll make it again because it's quick and uses the pasta and tomato soup I receive from the food pantry.

It was pretty good as is, but it was a little bland for us.  I did not care for the background taste of tomato soup.  I made it again a few weeks later and used pasta sauce in place of the tomato soup.  I added some finely diced onion which I sauteed with the ground beef.  With some dried basil, oregano and red pepper flakes it was even better.

First of all, I doubled the recipe since I have 2 teen-aged boys and a lil' girl that can keep up with them! I read through the reviews and decided to go ahead and be kind of liberal with adding flavor. The changes I made are: I seasoned the meat with onion and garlic while browning, I used milk instead of water, added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce, and 8 ounces of extra sharp cheddar. Oh, and I only had elbow noodles on hand, so I used those. Everyone loved it

The meat definitely needs something. I'll try the garlic or onions next time. Other than the meat the pasta and sauce was very nice.

I tried this as written, and not that great. I added hot sauce, red pepper flakes, garlic, and used beef broth and did also add a handful of cheese. These were all suggestions written by other reviewers and it did the trick. Delicious with all the changes.....

I loved this recipe! It was so simple yet it tasted yummmy (even better the next day!) You can add things to this to make it not so plain. This was on of the first recipes i made last year when i first began cooking. We enjoyed it :D

This is a good recipe for a quick weeknight dinner. It is pretty simple, cooks up quickly and it's easy to keep the ingredients on hand. I've made it exactly as the recipe is written and it's fine. Not earth moving but it gets the little bellies full, a feat not easily accomplished when you're feeding picky toddlers! When I cook it for my family I usually add onion and garlic as other reviewers suggest, but you could really get crazy if you want and add veggies and all kinds of spices.

bland. I added onion to the burger as well as a bit of minced garlic, and I added red pepper to the dish... Still pretty bland.

It was less than OK until you put seasonings in it. I have since turned it into a family favorite. :) With Italian seasoning, fresh garlic, green pepper, Worcestershire sauce, ground pepper and beef stock in the crock pot.. Even better as leftovers..  :)

Not great, but will make it again and try adding some other ingredients to jazz it up a bit.  It is VERY fast and easy to make though and is perfect if you need something right away.  You probably have the ingredients on hand too.
