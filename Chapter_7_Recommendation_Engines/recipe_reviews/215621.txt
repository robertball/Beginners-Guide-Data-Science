This is delicious. We use this method to prepare fish often. Hubby mentioned he would like grilled shrimp and scallops and I remembered seeing this recipe. Since we enjoy the fish so much I knew we would love this as well. Very clean, straight forward flavor from the seafood and lemon-butter. Perfect light meal for the upcoming hot evenings. The only changes we made were that we used less of each type of seafood in each serving, didn't really count the number of shrimp or mussels (used in place of clams), only placed 3 large sea scallops in each packet and 2 small pieces of corn in each. Also drizzled approx 2 Tbsp of white wine over everything before closing each. Super fast and easy with excellent results. This will be a regular weeknight dinner as well as served to impress company here this summer. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a light, easy weekend grill meal and boy, did this one hit the mark!  I used foil loaf pans and added about 2 T. white wine to each, as noted by other reviewers.  Also added some yellow squash.  Followed all other directions.  Absolutely devine!  Can't wait to make it again next weekend.

We used small foil bread pans, and covered with foil.  Also added a 1/2 (small) lobster tail, cut lengthwise to each.  Increased the butter by 50% to have more liquid for boiling/steaming.  Easy to prepare, awesome dish.  Will add some white wine next time.  Also, we garnished with parsley instead of chives.

very nice recipe!  I added raw mushrooms and red skin potato quarters to the packets.  I also didn't bother melting the butter.  Instead of using freshly grated lemon peel, I quartered the lemons and threw them in the packets after squeezing.  Next time I make this I will add muscles and season though with old bay or dill.  Definitely a keeper!

I scaled way back on the servings since it is only the two of us and clams are not available to me so I took the advice of the recipe submitter and used mussels instead. I also took the advice of previous reviewers and sprinkled some white wine over the top of each packet. We enjoyed this very much and I will use this recipe again.

Excellent!  Next time I will add a little crushed garlic to the packet. This would be an excellent meal for company because you it can all be made ahead of time and then just throw them on the grill.  Don't seal the packets, though, until you are ready to cook them so the clams remain alive.  Discard any clams that do not open.

Delicious!  We skipped the mussels and just went with the shrimp and the scallops.  We did just as the directions said but also added some white wine as some others had mentioned.  It was probably one of the best meals I have had in a long time, including restaurants!  We will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the idea!!

Delicious & simple! I didn't melt the butter, just added a little pat to each packet. Also added a sprinkle of Old Ba seasoning to each.  I've made this three times in a month!

This was easy and great.   I made two packets and added half of lobster tail to each.  I'm making it again this weekend.

This is my husband's favorite. So easy considering the results! I use Balance Light butter, and not quite so much. I zest a whole lemon as well. So good!

Only thing I did different was to leave out little necks and clams (tripled up the mussels) and skipped the onions as  my friend is allergic.  I would never have thought cooking only in wine would do what it did.  10 of us loved this recipe!

I have made these many times using 8 x 5" loaf pans, covered in aluminum foil.  If I have some, I also add split lobster tails to the mix along with some par-boiled Baby "B" potatoes, quartered.  Every type of seafood that I have tried is just so good prepared this way.  I use about 2 Tbsp of beer poured into each loaf pan before I seal them and get them on the grill.

Recipe was great!  We ended up using scallops and shrimp.  Both came out a little overdone.  We cooked them on the grill at 350 for 20 minutes. I think next time we will cook on lower heat, or for less time.

Very good.  I added the wine and some carrot sticks and green and yellow squash for color.  Also used Old Bay.  Think I will add a touch of hot sauce next time.

This was absolutely delicious!  My husband and two boys had third helpings.   Don't forget to have a baguette on hand for dipping in the broth!

You can get very creative with this recipe!  We didn't have  scallops or mussels  but added potato wedges and chorizo sausage slices.  We loved it and plan to use this recipe the next time we entertain.

Simply fabulous. We had friends from out of town and weather was gorgeous, grilled our packets. So delicious. Add some crusty French bread to soak up the juice and you have a very easy-to-prepare, but impressive casual dinner. Used slightly larger tomatoes, sort of medium size on the vine. I think smaller would disappear. Try this recipe.

I used shrimp and scallops, pats of butter and a lemon wedge. Seasoned generously with Old Bay. Grilled for 19 minutes. Restaurant quality to be sure!

Definitely making this again. I didn't want to spend the time cleaning clams so did shrimp and scallops. Delicious! Made brown rice with a little lemon and garlic butter sauce and broccoli tossed in orange juice, olive oil and garlic and served on clementine slices (yes I have kids). Next time will try olive oil with the seafood.

Delicious indeed!  I made this for a dinner party with a couple of revisions...Added garlic, fresh herbs & shallot.  In addition, I used king crab legs in lieu of clams & aspargus instead of corn (not in season)...turned out great!

Super easy!  Added white wine as suggested. Made in small loaf pans so easy to serve & clean up. Simple, fresh flavor. Paired with crusty French bread.

I made this for a party and it was perfect.  I did very few changes, but I did add some fingerling potatoes in it and then upped the salt a little bit.  This was perfect dinner party food because I did all prep in advance and then put the packets in the fridge to wait for cook time.

A summertime fave in my household.
