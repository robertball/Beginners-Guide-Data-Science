I'm not sure why this doesn't have more reviews? I watched the video first and it looked so easy, so I got the rest of the recipe here. Super easy and tasty. I didn't have silicone molds so I used parchment paper in a small tray and it worked just fine! Cut them into squares. Texture is great and flavor is delicious. I did not taste the coconut oil either. Definitely recommend this recipe, you can't go wrong!

Yum yum! This was delicious and much healthier than traditional fudge. Made it exactly as written but didn't have the silicone molds, so I lined a loaf pan with parchment paper and that worked just fine. I keep the fudge block in the freezer wrapped in cling wrap and just slice off a piece when I'm ready. This definitely isn't your traditional fudge as it needs to be kept cold, but it's yummy!

While this is great for vegans.  I WILL SAY THIS...EVERYONE THAT POSTED OF "THE COCONUT" TASTE..   DID   N O T... USE REFINED COCONUT OIL.  Refined cocnut oil is flavorless. Period.  That being said if you like the almond joy  taste go ahead and add a bit of coconut extract to take it on home... Good both ways .  Just thought  I'ld  put that out.  Vegans learn it all to quick.

I loved this and with some experimenting I did change some things.  I don't love nuts in sweets so I didn't use. I melted the refined coconut oil in a saucepan and added maple syrup. Off heat mixed in cocoa powder and  few tsp. of powdered sugar. Used small silicone square molds that I first dusted with cocoa powder. Turned out amazing!

Absolutely delicious! Decadently smooth, rich and not too sweet. Successfully used unrefined coconut oil. Did not have a silicone mold so I doubled the recipe and poured it into a lined 9 x 9 glass dish.

I screwed this up by not realizing my oil was coconut-sunflower oil, which has a much lower melting point. The fridge was simply not enough to solidify it. However, tossing it into the freezer allowed me to enjoy it just fine, with just the right texture, albeit with a nip of cold every time i bit into it.

I suspect, but haven't tried, that a few modifications to my screwup might make a good chocolate sauce for ice cream.

This makes a very tasty candy, similar in taste to Almond Joy. Especially if you use almonds in place of the walnuts, like I did.

Excellent vegan fudge recipe that is very easy to make. I didn’t feel that the amount of Maple Syrup called for made it too sweet. I have the Ninja silicone ice cube tray, which must be larger than the standard ice cube tray. If you have that accessory, you’ll have to double or triple the recipe to fill up all the cubes. Here are my tips: #1: Watch the video and do not follow step 1 as written. Chef John does not stir/combine maple, vanilla, and salt, and then stir in melted coconut oil. He stirs them all together. #2: Use refined coconut oil (accidentally used unrefined and didn’t care for taste); #3 The melted oil should be warm and not hot; #4: Back to tip #1 and maybe #3, not doing so will result in you stirring for a while. First 3 ingredients stirred will be very thick, add oil and you’ll be stirring for a hit (especially if oil is hot). Then, when you add walnuts to it, all the oil will separate and your mixture will be at bottom of bowl swimming in pool of oil. You’ll be stirring for quite a while. This fail on my end resulted in unpleasant fudge. My first two successful attempts were not as thick as in the video and more like a pudding consistency, but set perfectly in the freezer and was delicious!  The only reason why I can’t rate this recipe 5 stars is because of the way the directions are written in Step 1, which may or may not be Chef John’s fault.

I left out the nuts. It's a very easy recipe to make. The only problem I have with the recipe is that it's too little fudge! Double batches from next time.... And there are going to be lots of next times:-)

This is delicious!  But, read labels carefully.  Made my first batch with unrefined coconut oil.  Husband stirred and stirred, saying "You MUST have done something wrong...it should not take this long."  He was right.  Reread recipe and coconut oil label.  Next time fudge set up perfectly.  Used pecans because I like them better.  Next time will not use the silicone  molds.  Just put in in foil wrapped dish and then cut into pieces.  Does not make very much but it's delicious.

I was overwhelmed by the maple syrup flavor and could barely taste the chocolate but my mother (vegan) loved it.  I would suggest going with an alternative liquid sweetener.

This recipe was so easy and turned out delicious! I prefer it to traditional fudge and it was much easier to make. I did use refined coconut oil and there was no coconut flavor in the final product, just chocolates maple goodness. Will make again for sure.

Mine didn't even come close to getting solid at room temperature. I have had it in the freezer for days, and it is not firm enough to pop out of the silicone mold. It just mashes in there and cracks if I try to push from the bottom. I even tried running hot water over the back to pop them out, but wound up with drippy fudge water all over my hands and a still stuck piece of "fudge" in the tray.

I did use cold pressed coconut oil because I was making it for my Sister in law who has RA, and cold pressed has more health benefits than the refined or heat extracted kind. (also, she doesn't mind the coconut taste) It is solid at room temperature, so I'm not sure if I need to cut back on the maple syrup to get the consistency better? I was pretty bummed that I wasted such expensive coconut oil, but my husband is happy to eat my mistake.

Update: I tried it again, melting th coconut oil in a water bath, and once I stirred all together, started looking like the video. Added the toasted pecans and WHAMMO, the oil separated from the rest of the mixture and no amount of stirring would get it to mix together again. (And couldn't whisk it because of the nuts) It looks disgusting in the tray. I am super irritated because this seems like such a simple recipe. I am not an amature in the kitchen either. I make old fashioned fudge like
A champ, and that is no easy task. If I weren't making this for my sister in law, I would have thrown in the towel the first time.

I live in the Netherlands (Europe) so I love chocolate, and this turned out great! I added the second time almonds on every piece, before I froze it.
Next time I will try to combine the chocolate mix with coconut rasp, see how that turns out! My friends can't wait to taste them again...
