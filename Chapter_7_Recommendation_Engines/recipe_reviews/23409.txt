I'm from the south and grew up on classic buttermilk cornbread. I've since moved and forgot my family recipe, so I looked up a recipe here to jog my memory. This was a very good base recipe. The result was a crispy bottom, and soft moist middle. The perfect cornbread in my eyes. However, I did change a few things. First, I used an iron skillet. If you want a good crispy crust you must you an iron skillet. I preheated the oven to 400 degrees as the recipe says, then I put a cool iron skillet in the oven with a thin layer of vegetable oil on the bottom in the oven to heat. Heating the skillet before adding the mixture will prevent the bread from sticking. After preparing the skillet I Mixed the recipe together as directed except for a few minor exceptions. I did not use potato flakes or baking powder, I used buttermilk (this is also a must for cornbread), and I added a cup of cornmeal instead of 1/2 cup. Then I carefully took the hot skillet out of the oven (be careful, by now its HOT) Added the mixture, and baked for 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes was up I changed the stove to high broil to brown the top, not required but it adds a little extra something. If you do broil your break make sure to stay with it and watch, it shouldn't take more than a few seconds, 30 tops. Leaving it on broil too long will burn the bread. Good luck to anyone who makes this and thinks to Chefkimber for submitting a wonderful base recipe.

Very quick and tasty.  I sprinkle an extra teaspoon of sugar on top before baking for that sweet taste.

I was quite impressed with this cornbread recipe.  I was looking for a new cornbread recipe to make cornbread dressing with.  I doubled the recipe (but I only increased the baking powder by two additional teaspoons instead of four) and this recipe proved to be excellent.  It was a good base for my cornbread stuffing and won praises with my family.  This cornbread recipe is definitely a keeper for me.  I did omit the potato flakes and it still worked out very well.

If you grew up in the South eating grandma's cornbread on Sunday, you will not recognize this as cornbread.  The proportions of cornmeal to flour are backwards at best, and I even increased the meal to 1 cup.  Perhaps this is what passes for cornbread in some places, but not around here.

UFF, what can I say... it was quite moist but not sweet. I would have liked it with more cornmeal flavor too.

being from tennessee, i have had some pretty great cornbreads, and this is not one of them. this cornbread is just okay. i doubled the sugar and the cornmeal and used buttermilk and still it was rather dry. we had it last night with vegetable soup--it's great for crumbling into the soup, because you can't tell how dry it is, but for eating it by itself, like i said, it's just okay. i took one reviewers suggestion to preheat the pan with vegetable oil in it before adding the cornmeal mixture and unfortunately my cornbread stuck to the pan. so, i will not be doing that again!

This has to be the best cornbread I've had! Thank goodness I ran out of Jiffy mix. Maybe next time I will add a little more sugar, but other than that it was amazing!

I thought this was fabulous! It wasn't too sweet, which is a problem I have with allot of the cornbread recipes out there.  I was a little leery about the use of the potato flakes, but they added moistness and a tad bit of texture to finished product.  It was delicious with the Black beans I cooked.  This will be the recipe I use every time.   I must say mine cooked up a little less even on the top as compared to the picture accompanied with this recipe.

This cornbread recipe is actually pretty good. I only used it because all the other cornbread recipes called for buttermilk and i needed one that called for regular milk. I was kind of skeptical about using the potato flakes but it was actually pretty good. Well, that is,if you are making dressing with it. I would recommend that if you want some good "grandma's" southern cornbread, that you use a different recipe. This definitely isn't what I am used to when it comes to just regular cornbread, but it is good for dressings. Thanks!

First one I found that was good and worth saving.  i will tell you 2 tablespoons is not enough sugar if you like sweeter cornbread, i used 6 and it was perfect.  4 will still leave it a little bitter for me.  i did not have the potato flakes, made it anyway and it worked perfectly.  good and moist.

This is a great basic cornbread.  I did make my own adjustments as it wasn't salty or sweet enough for us.  I used 4 tablespoons of sugar, only 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and a teaspoon of salt.  I omitted the potato flakes, don't keep them on hand, and doubled the cornmeal instead.  I oiled and heated the cast iron skillet ahead of time and broiled for 30 seconds after as another poster suggested.  It came out wonderfully!  I whipped butter and honey together, one to one, and used as a spread.

I loved this recipe and I didn't change a thing!  It was fast and easy to put together and came out beautiful flaky and good.  I never would have thought about putting instant mashed potato flakes in cornbread but I think it really adds something.  Great job!

This was the first time I made cornbread that wasn't from the box. It was pretty easy. I could smell the mashed potato as I pulled it out of the oven but I never tasted it. I would have liked a little more cornbread flavor and it seemed a on the line of dry/crumbly and moist/spongy.

This was pretty good cornbread. I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup and followed Evianposh's suggestion of using a cast iron skillet. I also added a drained can of corn to it. I think I like this better than my usual cornbread, so I'm switching!

Personally I would give this recipe two stars, but my BH liked it.  I suppose he's used to "dry" cornbread.  The description says "so delicious and moist" that I thought I would try it.  It was neither for me.  Plus, it needed more cornmeal and less flour.

This cornbread is great. I love the addition of instant potatoes. Never thought of that before. I wanted a cornbread that wasn't sweet and this one fit the bill. The only change I made was I forgot to buy baking powder. Oops. But I had some self-rising flour. I was skeptical, but IT WORKED. I just needed to make a pan of cornbread to use for my Thanksgiving dressing. This one was perfect.

Good as written, I have a couple ideas of how to make it more "cornbread-y": Add more cornmeal and more milk, add 2 eggs instead of one.

We do not like sweet or dry, dense cornbread. This was moist and fluff and tasted amazing! I made it in a preheated cast iron skillet and it had a wonderful crust. I did not change a thing about the recipe and I thought it was superb! I think a review should be about the posted recipe, not about how it came out with modifications. Yummy as is!

I really liked this recipe - it is quite easy to make, and made it as written the first time. Afterwards, I left out the potato flakes and doubled the cornmeal. I also added a handful of cheddar cheese and a handful of corn (I find that this makes it less dry and adds a little extra flavor boost). The other thing that I recommend is to stir it with a whisk past the point of "just combined" - this also helps with the moist issue (I do this with the boxed variety as well and have had great reviews because of it).

I made this without the instant potatoes, I instead doubled the amount of yellow cornmeal in the recipe.  It turned out great.

This was a great standard sweet cornbread recipe. Perfect with a bowl of pinto beans and some fried 'taters!

This was okay, but I guess I prefer to have a stronger cornmeal flavor and texture in my cornbread.  I saw others' comments about this not being sweet enough.  I made it according to the recipe and thought it was fine.  This cornbread is very dense and has more of a bread-like quality than the cornbread I'm used to.

Was not sweet. I even tried with extra sugar. Was moist though. We will probably not be making this one again.

Pretty good recipe.  I used 1 cup of cornflour instead of the 1/2 cup cornmeal, withheld the sugar and instant mashed potatoe flakes so I could make a cornbread dressing. Pretty good. I then wanted sweet cornbread so I added the sugar in the recipe. I have never made this recipe using the instant mashed potatoes. Maybe I'll try that one day.
