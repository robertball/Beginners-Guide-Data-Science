I absolutely love this recipe (and yes, it is mine!)  I have to say that the hot fudge spread over the base cracker is very visible when cutting into the cheesecake.  I love that look :)  I also am in love with the sweet, saltiness from the peanut butter Ritz Crumble Topping and I am infatuated with the mixture of the peanut butter and caramel sauce.  I could eat that stuff by the spoonful.

Just a tip - make sure the hot fudge sauce is cold when it is spread on the cracker.  Even though you may think the heat will melt it and make it sink into the cracker, it does not.  It remains as a nice neat little layer in the cheesecake.  I hope you will enjoy!

These turned out quite nice....light and flavorful and that added crunch with the RITZ streusel on top was wonderful, even the peanut butter caramel topping was just fabulous. I only had the Smuckers Sugar Free Caramel Syrup on hand and .... hmmm let me tell you, worth making. It was a wonderuful balance between, sweet and salty. We had a young lady at the house, who doesn't care to much for cheese cake and she ate 3 of these and wanted the recipe. KUDOS!!!  I loved them!!!!

I had to modify mine a bit due to peanut allergies so I made a regular crumb topping and drizzled it with both caramel and fudge sauce.  These were hugely successful at a shower today and I am making them again for tomorrow in mini size so they will be one bite.  Great job, Shelby!

These came out very good. Without the sauce I thought the salt of the ritz cracker really stood out but once I added the sauce it changed the whole flavor profile. This was my first cheesecake. This recipe was very easy to follow.

These little cheesecakes are the perfect sweet bite!  I didn't have any fudge sauce, so I decided to add some mini chocolate chips to the batter and the crumb topping.  I also used plain Ritz crackers for the topping and replaced a TBS of the butter with peanut butter.  Thanks for the great recipe Shelby @ The Life & Loves of Grumpy's Honeybunch!

Oh my!! These turned out perfect!! We loved them and gobbled them up!! My husband doesn't really like caramel, so I left the sauce off a couple and then I noticed he bypassed the sauce-less ones. When I asked him about it he said the sauce is sooo good haha! Thanks Shelby @Grumpy's Honeybunch!! Love your blog!!

The cheesecake part of this recipe is lousy -  too eggy and bland. No amount of fancy toppings can redeem it, in my mind.
