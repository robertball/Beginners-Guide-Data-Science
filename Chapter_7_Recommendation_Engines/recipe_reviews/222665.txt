I made this soup, but I used salsa instead of the tomato bouillon and added celery for added health benefits.  I also kept out the spice I'd never heard of along with the Ceyenne peppers since we don't like spicy foods.  Yummy.

My family and I loved this hearty vegetarian soup - I used chicken stock instead of water and a cup of water instead of carrot juice, skipped the bouillons, added a tablespoon of tomato paste with the garlic, and used a bit more fresh tomato than called for - results were wonderful.  This will be a regular in the rotation, and next time I'll use veg stock to keep it vegan.  Awesome flavor, really great texture - thanks for the recipe!

Delicious recipe, perfect for Alaskan winter! I did add salsa instead of the second tomato, and it gave a nice spicy aftertaste. I didnâ€™t have zartar, just added a little thyme.

I enjoyed this recipe and loved that it was all 1 pot without too many steps.  I did think it was a tad too spicy and will leave out the cayenne next time.  Also, because of some of the warnings about carrot juice, I left it out completely.  I didn't have tomato bullion but used 2 tbs of tomato paste and thought the taste and texture was great as far as that goes.

I knew I would like this recipe because it has three things that I love: lentils, zaatar, bulghur. I often put bulghur in soups but adding the zaatar (which I have never used in soup before) was key in making this soup wonderful for me. Specifics: I used Lebanese blend zaatar and coarse bulghur. Yum! I think next time I would make Middle Eastern 'mountain bread' with zaatar and have it with this soup. Delish! Also for me this is 4 bowls...I like hearty servings of soup.

I did not have bulgur, so I used quick cooking brown rice instead- which was great for gluten free.  Did not have carrot juice so I boiled one cup carrots and pureed them in the cooking water. Everyone loved it.

Be careful with the carrot juice! I added as much as described and it was like you'd poured sugar over the soup. I didn't like the flavor, but by increasing the amounts of everything else the sweet taste eventually disappeared, and a pretty tasteful soup emerged. I wish I had a mixer, because the consistence is not very soup-y without blending.

Yum! I used ingredients that I had in house. So I made carrot juice in my vitamix, substituted tomato sauce for tomatoes, and chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  Added just a pinch of cayenne. Also needed to add an additional 2 cups of broth. Wish I had doubled the recipe. Very easy to make!
