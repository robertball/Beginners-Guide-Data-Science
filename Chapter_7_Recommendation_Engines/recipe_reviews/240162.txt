We loved this pie and the flavor it had. 2 things I did differently was I added the cinnamon to the pumpkin mixture ( my own fault) Then I seen a few people was having trouble having it set up so I tried what I do with another style of pumpkin pie like this and that is I whip the heck out of the pumpkin, sugar, and cream cheese mixture then fold in the whip cream. It held up nicely and tasted wonderful.

I made it just like the recipe,but I added extra pumpkin spice,so the cream cheese wouldn't over take the pumpkin flavor. Also ,I read all the comments and I added a package sugar free cheesecake pudding to firm it up and 1/2 of 2%milk and it came out beautifully.!

This is a dessert with very good flavor. It tastes like pumpkin pie meets cheesecake, however it doesn't seem to set properly. It wasn't too sweet which was nice. I used fresh whipped cream instead of "frozen whipped topping". I read the ingredients list of whipped toppings and they contain a lot of thickeners so this may have contributed to mine not setting. I also used homemade pumpkin pie filling. I even tried adding gelatin and that didn't help. After 6 hours in the fridge it was runny. I have now put it in the freezer and have decided to treat it like an ice cream treat. It tastes good. It is like a pumpkin pie mousse. The only thing is I ate it with a spoon. Thanks Karaoke Ken for the recipe, I will try it again with some thickeners the next time.

I made some adjustments based on personal taste, what I had on hand and after reading the reviews.  I made it twice for Thanksgiving get-together and they both turned out great and were a hit, multiple request for recipe.
I only had plain canned pumpkin so I used it rather than going to the store for pie filler, I added pumpkin pie spice for taste.  I also added an additional 8 oz cream cheese to give it a stronger cheesecake taste. Due to not wanting to freeze it,  I added 1 pkt of gelatin.  The consistency was great and was not runny at all.  I served them in individual  cups with ginger snaps as the crust.  I also make my own whipped cream and made it very stiff.

This was delicious! I used pumpkin puree because that is what I had on hand. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to give it the pumpkin pie taste. I used one 8 oz. package of cream cheese. I saw no reason to add the extra  3/4 oz. I froze mine as well and it was delicious. I tried the filling when I was making this and was a little concerned but 24 hours later the tastes married together and it was splendid! I have been asked to make this at my upcoming holiday meals.

This did have great flavor. After reading Buckwheat Queens review I froze the pie which made it easier to slice, still it barely held it's shape. Not quite sure what would happen if I didn't freeze it. I never knew that there was such a thing as a prepared shortbread pie crust however I will be buying more of them.

Yum - this recipe was a hit!  The one thing I changed was adding 1/2 pkg of vanilla instant pudding.  I will be making it again, everyone loved it!

Would have been better to mix the cream cheese and icing sugar together first, before adding the pumpkin.  Cream cheese didnt mix in well.  I wont make again.

This was such an easy pie to pull together! In less than five minutes I had the pie in the fridge to set up.  This pie really had the flavors of fall and would be great to make ahead and freeze!

I used 3 bricks of cream cheese mixed with whipped topping to 3 prepared Graham crusts. Also I mixed up a little bit of cream cheese and whipped topping with some orange(10 drops yellow, 2 drops red) food coloring to draw a pumpkin face on top. Loved this just as good as my new York style pumpkin cheesecake ?
