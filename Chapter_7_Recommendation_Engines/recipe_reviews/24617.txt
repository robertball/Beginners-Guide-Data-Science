No sour cream! Use Hellman's mayo, it just tastes better and up it to 2 cups. Cut cellery to 1/2" cup. Add 1/2cup red onion, 1/2cup white onion and 1/2cup fresh red bell pepper (not pimento) and up the green pepper to 1/2cup as well. Skip the sour cream, lemon juice, jalapeno and pimento. Instead add a dash of red wime vinager and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. Also, the only seafood you'll need is 1 cup of crab, 1 cup of lobster and one cup of shrimp - all chopped. And don't forget to add a dash of black pepper. Mix and let stand at least 3 hours for the best flavor. This is a much better rendition of the recipe, surely to please all those seafood lovers! Great on crackers and as a sandwich!

I made this recipe yesterday for my daughters First Holy Communion and it was a big hit.  I did use imitation crab meat and had to leave out the jalepeno (my mother-in-law won't eat anything that even sounds spicy).  I also had to leave out the sour cream.  I put the mayo in first and it seemed too wet already so I just omitted the SC.  I thought it tasted delicious without it and will make this recipe again.

VERY GOOD! Has wonderful flavor.  If you like a seafood flavor you will like this salad.  I omitted the peminto peppers and it still had a wonder flavor.

I love this recipe and that is my picture up there with the macaroni in it. I followed the recipe exactly and then added the elbow macaroni. That's how I like it. I also put the jalopeno peppers on the side.
