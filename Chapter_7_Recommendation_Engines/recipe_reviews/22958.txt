Extremely disappointing! The meat didn't come out tender at all and the sauce had a funny taste that no one liked. I ended up dumping this out and ordering take out. I won't be making this again.

This was pretty tasty. I used this recipe because everything it called for I had on hand so that was convenient. The only thing I did different was toss everything in the crock pot for 6 hours on high instead of baking. Meat was very tender and easy to shred. I'm only giving it three stars because I guess I was looking for more of a barbeque flavor but maybe I am just used to bottled barbeque sauce. I served this with warmed flour tortillas and shredded cheddar cheese and husband enjoyed it this way. He is used to eating shredded pork bbq on rolls and he liked the change. I do think its funny that the first person to review this recipe seems like it is the author of the recipe herself either that or its just a coincidence.;)

This was the most wonderful tasting beef I have had in a while. I made it with homemade tortillas. A winner in our home.

I have made this twice and it came out really tasty both times. I think adding a little liquid smoke next time will make it even better. Leftovers go great on flour tortillas.

I made a small batch for dinner the other night but then took leftovers to work the next day. I had so many of my coworkers asking what I had and to try some I ended up making a HUGE bath and taking it to work cook-out. It was gone in 15 minutes!

I was skeptical about the tomato soup but tried it anyway. I sprinkled the meat with a blend of seasonings I use for my regular pulled pork. I thought it cooked nicely. The beef was more tender than the pork. I would made this recipe again.
