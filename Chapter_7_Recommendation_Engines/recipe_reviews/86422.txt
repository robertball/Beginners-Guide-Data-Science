I added in some fresh minced garlic when I threw in the onion and I used Johnny's Seasoning Salt in place of real salt. As I made the soft tacos, I spread a mix of sour cream/salsa on the tortilla, spooned some of the mixture into the tortilla, then sprinkled some extra sharp white cheddar cheese on the top. HUGE hit with the family. The boys especially liked these. I made this for breakfast both weekend days.

Oh so delicious! I cooked the onions in with the potatoes until they were translucent and tender too, I only used 2 T milk. All I added was picante sauce on mine. I could eat these all the time! I cut this in half. Thanks for sharing this, Rhonda!

I've been making these for breakfast on a weekly basis.  My kids even make them!  To cut the time in half to prepare I microwave the bacon, skip the onion, then bake the potato in the microwave while scambling the eggs in the pan. To assemble cut open potato and scoop into tortilla, crumple bacon (sometimes we use ground sage sausage in place of the bacon) and egg and Top with fresh shredded jack or cheddar cheese and Ranch dressing!

This didn't turn out quite like how I had pictured, but it did taste pretty good. It didn't knock my socks off. The problem is the recipe doesn't specify thickness of potatoes, which made a big difference in how it turns out. Too thick and they're underdone, too thin and they fall apart before you get the eggs in. I also think it would benefit from a little garlic and finely chopped green pepper. Also, I added some shredded cheddar cheese inside the tortilla. Final verdict: it's okay but not that special.

i halved this, and it would have easily fed 3 people. i cut the potatoes the same size you'd see at a restaurant. and i used unpeeled new potatoes. would probably use fewer potatoes. i also added avocado and cheddar cheese and it was good. would probably be good with a little salsa too.

This was super fast to throw together amd filling too. I fried the potato with the onion to get the extra taste going through it. Served with salsa this made a delicious supper on a hot day.

In South Texas, these taquitos (ta-key-toes) are a regular breakfast for the majority of the folks. You can make your own or buy them at DQ or dozens of other eateries in different meat/cheese/vegie combos in flour tortillas.  This looks like a great recipe from a fellow Texan and I intend to try it. Sorry DQ, once in a while I have to cook breakfast for me and the old coot. LOL Thanks for the posting!

I made this with the addition of seasoning salt to the potatoes, and garlic salt to the eggs. I also added the corn like another person suggested. These were so yummy and super easy to make. I will make these again. Thanks for sharing!!

I love breakfast tacos and they're one of the things I miss the most about Texan cuisine. To make this a little bit more lively, don't forget to add a dusting of chili powder & a touch of cumin!! Also, spicy chorizo from your local market also makes a great substitute for bacon!! These are complemented very well by some good salsa. Thanks!

Very basic, but good.  I ate three. One with hot sauce. One with chili sauce. One with sweet and spicy barbeque sauce.  The winner is chili sauce.  It is kind of a blank canvas recipe.

This is a great one dish breakfast or dinner. This would be soo good served with some beans. I only used four eggs and forgot to add the water or the milk to them. I had some flat out wraps so I used those in place of the corn tortillas. Yummy!!

I made this without bacon-since I'm a vegetarian, and it was pretty good, but I really wanted a contrast of flavor, so next time I think I'll add some chopped bell peppers, corn and garlic. I'll be making this again for sure!

This is really good. I make it all the time but I add salsa and garlic powder to eggs before beating them and skip the water and milk. I then cook the potatoes and dump eggs into skillet with potatoes and top with bacon and cheese and throw the entire egg concoction under the broiler and cook until it poofs and cheese is melted. It makes it more like a frittata but you get more egg this way

This was good!  I added some extra seasonings, just to pick up the flavor a little, but they go great straight into the freezer, for those busy mornings!

I made two servings for my bf & I. Didn't have enough bacon so used a turkey linkette. I don't use black pepper so I just used seasoned salt, may have added other seasonings can't remember. I used my own hand made corn tortillas with maseca. My bf & I loved it, he was very impressed. Thank-you 4 this great recipe.

Made for dinner tonight...everyone enjoyed the taco's..yeah! I did make some changes. First, I baked the potatoes in the microwave. I substituted sausage for the bacon. I added garlic & onion powders, sea salt, paprika & chili powder to the eggs. I also topped the tacos with shredded cheese. I'll certainly be making again!

We made this for a quick breakfast this morning.  It was really good. Can't wait to try it with some ground sausage!
