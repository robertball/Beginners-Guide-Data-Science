I added bacon when cooking the onions, some rotel diced tomatoes, fresh garlic, and hot sauce and this was very tasty and quick!

Late on New Year's Day, we decided we needed a dish with black eyed peas and tomatoes; it was a little late to fix anything without the word "easy" in it, so I gave this one a try.  I used crushed pepper flakes instead of the cayenne and added a can of rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies to spice it up a bit.  I was skeptical because it was so easy, but it was delicious.  Next time I will add some shrimp.

My Husband and I had this for New Years Day for good luck.  It was just delicious and great.  We decided we would definitley make this our New Years Day Tradition.  It was so Easy. We used jalepeno and ham black eyed pea cans instead of regular ones.  And instead of sausage we used Spiral Sliced Ham cut up.  Hope others like as much as we did.

Hubs and I really enjoyed this & easy is right.  I did add some chopped celery and red pepper with the onion, and some garlic powder, onion powder and cajun seasoning.  Very simple but tasty dish.  I also used turkey smoked sausage which I don't think took away from flavor at all.

This was easy (as advertised), quick to make, and tasted very good. I decreased the servings on this recipe, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Do not add salt until you taste this as the smoked sausage adds some salt to the mix. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Very easy and very tasty. The only thing I did differently is to use dried black eyed peas that I cooked in the slow cooker all day. When I got home from work I just tossed the rest of the stuff together for a quick dinner. Oh, and I added some garlic and salt.

This was a hit for New Year's lunch!  I made jasmine rice instead of instant.  I just reduced the amount of liquid that I used and then put the cooked rice in the pan with everything and let it cook down.  It was great!

Very quick and inexpensive dish to make, but really did not have much flaovr.  I will definitely make it again, but will try to tweak it with some bacon, hot sauce and garlic.

Good for New Year's Day - Used Johnsonville turkey sausage, adjusted everything for 6 servings, used 2 cans peas;  1 can drained diced tomatoes; a dash cajun seasoning instead of cayenne; cooked onion and garlic with 2 slices bacon, then disgarded bacon since we're trying to eat healthier

I gave this a star for being inexpensive to make, one star for easy, and one star for quick, but it seemed a bit flavorless without some added seasoning. Which my husband used sazon seasoning.

My entire family loved this. We used 2 lbs sausage as all my boys were insisting 1 package would not be enough, but then they love meat overkill. One pound would be plenty! We will be making this again, its an easy weeknight meal.

My recipe is just about the same except I use the cajun trinity and I use pre-cooked rice. This is so much better then red beans and rice. Delicious any time of the year. Goes great with cronbread.

This is the first year that I am actually enjoying the black eye pea part of New Year.  This dish is amazing!! Now if I can just keep my husband out of the pot until the cornbread is done...lol
I did make my own stock with chicken base so the flavor is awesome!!

Just added a tiny bit of garlic powder and a shake of herb and garlic salt free seasoning. Used Andouille pork free chicken sausage because we don't eat pork, and everyone loved it.  That along with some cornbread is our must have New Year's day meal.

Too bland without my additions so I  made a few changes. I added chunks of chicken, 2 stalks celery, 1 can of tomato sauce (I actually meant to use a can of diced tomatoes but  read the can wrong, but it turned out great!), sprinkle of Cajun creole seasoning spice, 2 tsp garlic, pepper , and salt. Then made it with a wild rice and quinoa blend. It was really good! ?? Shrimp would probably be good to add.

This is not Hoppin' John. A proper Hoppin' John has crispy rice. This recipe is more like a hoppin' risotto.

Wow!  Against my better judgement I used a can of blackeyed peas, by the time it was ready to serve the peas were overcooked and mushy.  Next time frozen peas only.  Overall, I found it very tasty and just spicey enough.

This was great! I made a half recipe using left over hickory smoked ham. I cooked basmati rice, so added 1 cup of chicken bouillon. I used only 1/8 tsp cayenne.

This was delicious! Only thing I changed was the seasoning. The little bit of cayenne would leave it bland. I did Cajun seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder and chili powder. I also did Brown minute rice.

I make this all the time, not just for New Years Day. I also add a can of diced tomatoes with chilis and I use long grain rice. My 23 yr old grandson absolutely loves this.

This was the best Hoppin' John I've ever made.  The only change I made (which didn't affect the taste at all) was:  I ALWAYS cook regular long-grain rice in a microwave cooker especially made just for rice.  It makes dependable fluffy rice every single time.

Nothing to write home about. Pretty blah in flavor. You should DEFINITELY adjust the cayenne unless your family LOVES hot n' spicy food. I'd cut it in half (at least) for most people, my family included - my older kids could barely eat it and they're used to spicy food. The youngest couldn't eat it at all. I wish I'd chosen a different recipe for my first taste of blackeye peas.
