The end result in my house as it was delish. I found that you need to use good judgment on the size of the onion. Use too much chopped onion results in a not so formed or held together meatball. That's just a heads up with some advice. If you have to much, just throw it in the tomato sauce and let it cook with it. However, recipe simple, easy and fast to whip together. I was worried about no spice or proper seasoning in the beginning but when it was all said and done, reminded me of the filling to cabbage rolls without the cabbage. I served over cheesy garlic mashed potatoes and called it a day. Will make again as my family said it was worthy as a repeat offender. TY

Updated review: I've made these meatballs several more times (with the pineapple sauce still) and so far, my favorite version is with 2 tsp salt and a few shakes of worcestire mixed in the meat mix before cooking. 

Original review: Tomato sauce hasn't been agreeing with me lately, so I'm rating the recipe even though I altered it (I know, I should be burned at the stake for my crime). I added 1 tsp seasoning salt (as suggested by submitter) to the meat mix, and cooked the meatballs in plain water without the tomato sauce. Then I used the Spicy Pineapple Sauce recipe from this site as the sauce. The dish came out really good. The meatballs needed some more seasoning salt, but the meatballs were surprisingly tasty for such bland ingredients. The pineapple sauce was delicious, and they really paired together nicely. I'll make the pineapple meatball dish again and again since it was easy.

I put an Italian twist to it. Used (to the sauce), Worcestershire, diced onion, 4 cloves of garlic, basil and oregano. Oh, and I used tomato soup (Campbellâ€™s).

My mom always made this for us... they're even better the next day with a little squirt of ketchup lol. I'm glad I'm not the only one who loves this simple, yummy meatball.

This is a long time favorite for several generations.  Chief differences are long grain rice instead of instant and tomato soup instead of sauce.
