I made this recipe for dinner tonight and my family and I loved it! I didn't use the green peppers or paprika and all I had was sharp cheddar cheese but it was delicious just the same.

This was very easy to put together. I did omit the onion only because my kids refuse to eat it. The country gravy packet really added flavor to it. My packet was about half the size it called for, it may have been a little overpowering if I had added another one. This was a great recipe, one I will make again! Thank you for a great breakfast!

This is a GREAT recipe.  Very easy to prepare and everyone loved it!  I put the layers together the night before, then added the egg mixture and baked it in the morning.
Changes: 
Used 8 eggs instead of 6
Used 9 x 13 casserole dish
Used pre cooked, packaged breakfast sausage
Covered with foil for first 40 minutes, then removed foil so it could brown a little

I've made many egg casseroles over the years and this is the best. I made it exactly as written and it was delicious.   The gravy mix in the eggs is terrific.  More interesting flavor than plain eggs.  
Now that I've made it several times, I will share some tweaks that work well.  I sprinkle an 8 oz package of diced ham on top of the sausage on the bottom.  2 green onions chopped go on next, and some partially cooked green and red peppers if on hand.  Next the potatoes.  I always use Tater Tots in an egg casserole, vs the frozen shredded hash browns. They're sturdier.  I use more than 16 oz, maybe 20?  Enough to cover the meats in a single layer.  Next the shredded cheese.  I use more than 2 cups, closer to 3.  For the eggs, I use the peppered gravy mix, and I use 8 eggs with 1 cup of milk.  That's it.  Bake it at 325, 70 minutes.  Let it stand 15 minutes, and then you can slice it into pieces.  
This is a delicious recipe!  Thank you for sharing.
**Also, it's so easy to make ahead.   Follow steps for meat, potatoes, cheese.  Cover and refrigerate.  Then take it out a half hour before cooking it, to bring it more to room temp.  Follow directions for mixing up eggs, etc, pour them on, and bake as directed.   Easy and delicious.

This was a hit at the office.  The only changes I made, after reading the reviews, were I used 8 eggs, about 3/4 of the gravy powder, and covered it with foil 50 minutes of the hour.  I prepared everything, except the egg mixture, the night before and baked it the following morning for an hour with foil on top for all but the last 10 minutes.  Sooo yummy!

This was great! Like others, I left out the green onions because we have some picky eaters in the house, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The recipe doesn't specify, but you should definitely make sure to thaw the hash browns before putting them in the casserole.

Love the flavor, but the cheese on top got very hard in the hour it took to cook. I'd rather have the cheese ooey and gooey instead of hard and chewy as it turned out. I think next time I will only add the cheese at about 20 minutes left to cook. I'll definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I lightened it up by using turkey sausage, low fat sharp cheddar and mozzarella, and egg beaters.  I didn't have green onions, so I cooked some white onions and garlic with the sausage.  Topped with fresh rosemary and covered with foil the last half of baking.  Everyone loved our breakfast for dinner!  I will be making this one again!

I prepared this casserole for Sunday Brunch and everyone raved!
WOW. I would serve this to anyone with pride.
I did follow suggestions to, (1): leave off the cheese, cover with foil, and bake for 50 minutes. And (2), remove foil, cover casserole with the cheese and return to oven until hot and gooey.
(3):  I personally like my cheese browned attractively a bit, so I did the "cheese melting gooey" stage under the broiler.  So yummy.
Congrats to 'bmatheson' :)

I made this for a recent camping trip.  Fed 6 adults and 4 kids with leftovers.  It was a huge hit!  I used chives instead of green onions as my garden is bursting with them right now and it added a nice subtlety.  I was using the oven in my trailer so not as reliable as my kitchen, but I think it was around the right temp!  I added 1.5 cups of the cheese when the recipe states and then covered with foil for the first 45 min.  For the final 15 min of bake time, I removed the foil and topped with the remaining 1/2 C of cheese.  Thank goodness other reviewers said to use a 9x13 pan.  The 11x7 never would have contained it all!  I will most definitely make this one again.  YUM!!

I made this today.  MMMmm  If I make this again, I would add 1-2 more eggs.  I would slightly fry the hash browns before I used them to brown   & crunch them.    I cut down the milk to 3/4 cup, and used a bit of Frank's hot sauce to the eggs.  I may even use a little bacon and short the sausage.  I  did make it in a  smaller deeper pyrex dish with higher sides.  Therefore it did take longer to cook it.

I have made this twice for a breakfast at church and I have never brought home leftovers.  The things I did different were I used a plain pork sausage but added about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes after draining the fat.  I slightly browned the hash browns before layering them on top of the sausage.  I used 8 eggs and 1 cup milk plus 1/4 cup half & half.  I added 2 kitchen tablespoons of Franks hot sauce to the egg mix.  I used what ever cheese I had on hand and baked it 40 minutes with foil and 20 without.  People ask for my recipe but never bringing any home says volumes.

I bought a 7 x 11 pan for this and ended up having to use my 9 x 13. I have my doubts about it fitting into a 8 x 11, unless it's Pyrex (with the higher sides). It did a good job of pretty much filling my 9 x 13, before the cheese was melted. Other than that, it didn't take a full hour, so the cheese did not get too hard. Very easy and tasty even at room temperature and filling. Will make again.

I've made this casserole three times now and my family loves it!! I've looked at many different breakfast "make a head" reciepes on this site and others and tried a few of them, this is by far the best! It is easy to change the ingredients to what you have on hand and it still comes out delicious . I have used bacon instead of sausage, shoestring potatoes instead of hashbrowns, a combo of cheddar and monteray jack, added red, green and onion frozen fajita mix to the dish and it turns out great. The one thing that I haven't tried is to make it an 'overnight' casserole. I'm making this today for tomorrow morning - Labor Day party, using shoestring potato, fajita mix peppers, country peppered gravy and cheese combo. I'll post the results later.

I made this for my parents on Christmas morning and it was a hit! I did not use the gravy packet but it was still excellent! Next time I am going to completely thaw the hash browns as it got a little watery. Very easy to put together and even make ahead of time. Thank you.

I loved this recipe. It was a nice change to use the gravy mix instead of cream of mushroom soup. The consistency was great and guests liked this recipe better than the last one I made. I added some red and green chopped peppers and one extra egg.

My family loved this recipe. This is the first casserole my husband has liked, and it was simple enough for a beginner like me. I did make a few changes: (1) I didn't have sausage, so I used turkey bacon. I cut them into small pieces and browned them before laying them on the bottom. (2) I used half of an onion instead of a green pepper. I put a small amount of water in the pan that still had just a little bit of bacon grease and threw in the pieces of onion. I sautéed them for only a few minutes. (3) We didn't have hash browns so I thawed tater tots and mashed them up. (4) I cooked it at 375 degrees. and used the tin foil method that other reviewers recommended. (5) I cooked it in a 9x13 pan, and left out the gravy.

It was perfectly moist and the edges were perfectly crispy. Loved it!

I tried this but that "country gravy" ruined it..no one would eat it. I tried it again without the "gravy" and everyone was looking for more.

This is an amazing recipe.  It had the best flavor.   There were only a couple of things I did differently.  I browned the hash browns in a skillet before layering on top and omitted the green onion.  I will definitely make this again.

OK, I've made this enough times I seldom look at the recipe anymore. I hollered at my wife to see if she remembered the temp setting. She said 375° F so I just went with it. Mixed up everything put it in the pan and covered it with aluminum foil  (we always do that for 45 minutes). Went in after 45 minutes to uncover it for the last 15 and noticed it was darker and raised up more than normal. I put a little cheese on top & popped it back in the oven. Then checked the recipe.  325° F it says so I turned it down for the remainder of the time. All I can say is OMG! I have officially changed the way I do this forever more...

Tried this and it was very good. I always read the lowest ratings first to see what people didn't like. Since many of the reviews said it needed something to add to the flavor, I added seasoning salt. It still could have used something but not sure what. My husband likes to put salsa on breakfast casseroles and said that gave it a flavor boost. Will make this again. Thanks for sharing

My selective eating husband loves it! The only change was to increase to 8 eggs. I think it needed  salt, but that could be personal taste. I used dehydrated hash browns and onions because that is what I had. Rehydrated and it worked fine. It is a define keeper. Thanks bmatheson!

This was delicious! I used link sausage that I chopped up after browning, 2 extra eggs, and slightly less milk (about 3/4 a cup). I also browned the hash browns before adding them, and I  covered the casserole with foil till the last 10 minutes, at which time I added the cheese, which allowed it time to melt but not become hard.  I will certainly make this again.

I did not use bread but frozen hashbrowns instead. I also used bacon with the sausage. It was wonderful for Christmas morning and my family loved it!

I made this on Thanksgiving day for breakfast, it turned out great. I browned the hash browns before adding, and added 2 more eggs. So Delicious!

This is a really good casserole. I followed the directions all the way up until adding the cheese and then put it in the fridge overnight, added the egg mixture in the morning and it came out perfect. The only thing I did different was do 8 eggs instead of 6.

Tried for the first time - with changes suggested by reviewers: I put frozen hash browns into skillet used to cook sausage with the pan drippings and a little olive oil; cooked till lightly browned. I used 8 large eggs. I had to substitute about 2 Tbls. chopped white onion for green. I sprinkled paprika over dish instead of stirring into egg mixture. Because the hash browns were hot,  I lessened baking time to 40 min., 9x13 pan tightly covered with foil. It couldn't have been more perfect. A new family tradition! Note: I (unintentionally) poured egg mixture somewhat unevenly & that gave it a nice texture where cheese was prominent in spots & egg whites in others. I cut leftovers into squares and froze; they tasted great when microwaved.

The hashbrowns were in a larger bag  so I added extra eggs and cheese. It turned out delicious! Definitely a hit with the family.

I made this with the ingredients I had on hand. For the potatoes I microwaved/baked 3 medium Idaho potatoes and then shredded them. I used about 1/2 C. of diced onions because I can't cook without them. I also added about 1/4 C. red bell pepper for color. After cooking the sausage, onions, and pepper together I put the potatoes and the sausage mixture into a bowl and gently mixed them. I beat 8 eggs (as per other reviewers) and 1 C. of milk added about 2 tsp. of seasoned salt and 2tsp. hot sauce. I folded in 3/4 of the cheese into the potato mix and added the milk and eggs. This was all put into a 9 X13 pan and baked for 45 min. Then topped of with the remainer of the cheese and baked until done. I wanted to use the country gravy seasoning, but didn't have any in the house. I will try this with the gray mix. The casserole does not have to sit overnight like a lot of the ones with bread. The texture was similiar to a breakfast casserole using bread, but had a disintive potato flavor. It was very GOOD.

I love this recipe as is!  I do mix it up a little depending in what I have on hand and who I'm feeding. Definitely add the two eggs or even double the gravy. A larger 9x13 is necessary or a 3 qt pyrex.

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times with varying ingredients.  One time I added diced fresh baby bella mushrooms. It's a great breakfast to take to work during the week.  I usually make it for Sunday breakfast, then freeze individual portions for later.  Thanks for sharing!

My family really likes this casserole.   I used the pre-cooked sausage crumbles and followed the recipe.  I did add some thin slices of tomato on top while it baked and it turned out nicely.

Did everything this recipe called for with some hot sauce to top it off and the family loved it...next time I think I should add some salt and pepper, needed a little something and I believe that was it. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for a breakfast meeting at the office and got rave reviews.  I didn't add the onion as I was out.  It went together very quickly and was seasoned just right.  I'm making this again for breakfast at my house.  I used a 9x13 pan which was perfect.

I made it in an 8x8 pan so, therefore I only used 5 eggs, but kept all the other ingredients the same; EXCEPT I only used the white, of 2 green onions in mine and it was perfect for our family.  I did add Montreal Steak seasoning to the egg, milk mixture and a hefty dash of salt and pepper.  I found it to be a bit dry, so I think next time I may look up a "breakfast" type sauce to serve over it once it has baked.

Love it! Definitely ensure hash browns are dethawed. It took me longer than 60 minutes at 325, so I turned it up to 350 at 40 minutes and uncovered the last 10 minutes of the 60 minute cook time.  I substituted sausage for ham. And added top layer of cheese towards the last 30 minutes of cooking. Let it rest. Came out beautifully. I could cut square pieces that looked like I knew what I was doing!

I’ve made this many times and it’s so easy. I change mine just a little. Instead of using bread I use crescent rolls on the bottom, cover with foil, and cook for 30 minutes. Then remove the foil and add crescent rolls to the top and finish baking. It’s so delicious!

This was excellent! Was worried it would be too eggy, but it was perfect! I used an extra lean pork sausage which prevented sogginess. I disagree with the cook time though. 25min was plenty of time.

I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of adding a 2.5 oz bag of real bacon bits over the top prior to baking. The grease from the bacon bits seemed to keep the cheese hydrated. Delicious!

This is a very good recipe! I left out the potatoes to lower the carbs. It felt odd not adding salt or pepper, but it really didn’t need it, the gravy mix packet, paprika and spices in the sausage were enough. I upped the oven temperature to 350 and it was done in 30 minutes. I added some more cheese on top and put it in 2 more minutes until it melted. Tasty!

I made this using a gluten free country gravy packet and it turned out great! First breakfast casserole all four of my family members truly enjoyed!

Made this for a work potluck, and it was a hit!  I put together 3 pans of it the night before and baked them for an hour in the morning.  Great recipe and not too many ingredients.

Very tasty recipe; no need to change anything unless you don’t like certain ingredients.  The good thing about this recipe is you can add different ingredients that you like or delete the ones you don’t like.  Simple to make.

I made this recipe for brunch and everyone seemed to like it.  I put the hash browns, browned sausage and some cheddar cheese and green onions in my baking dish the night before and in the morning added the combined 8 eggs, 3/4 pkg gravy mix, 3/4 c. milk (I actually used evaporated milk as we don’t keep milk on hand), and paprika. I topped with cheddar cheese and green onions and covered with foil. I baked it for 30 minutes, then removed the foil and baked it another 30 minutes. That kept the cheese from drying out. I served it with green salsa.  I will make it again.

This is a very good recipe. Did adjust with an additional egg and we used a sage breakfast sausage. It was really hard to stop with one serving. Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious, I’ve used vegetarian sausage meat which was amazing and I’ve also sliced sausages, sautéed them and used them instead of sausage meat. This is great for large groups on Saturday or Sunday mornings served with toast and sliced fresh tomatoes, my new favorite.

This recipe is very simple to prepare.  I used turkey sausage, and the results were amazing.  It is very good with a little green salsa, and avocado on top (after it bakes, for individual preference).

I made this recipe for my husband to take to work. I followed it as written except for the paprika. My husband has thanked me numerous times. He says it is the best breakfast that anyone has brought in the 5 yrs he has been there. People have continued to compliment it all week long. It was a huge hit. I plan to make it again soon.

This is truly one of the best Breakfast Casseroles I've made. I loved the added flavor of the country gravy. I did reduce the amount of the milk to 3/4 cup and added diced ham. Excellent recipe for any Brunch. Lady D

Ive made this a few times and everyone loves it.  I cook my hashbrowns a little brown before putting them in the casserole.  I also have not used the gravy mix and like to use half n half instead of milk.

Excellent! If Almond Milk, or the like is used, the amount needs to be decreased a little as it will leave behind a little excess "water". Other than that, I enjoyed the dish.

I love this easy casserole dish.  I didn't have milk or country gravy mix, but I did have a can of country gravy.  I mixed the eggs in that, voila!  It tasted great.  I will probably do it this way all the time.

Was Pretty Good. Followed some of the reviewers and browned hashbrowns before hand and used 8 eggs. Thought I had a packet of gravy but I didn't so made some with the sausage from a recipe on this site.

Sausage Gravy went on the bottom, hashbrowns, cheese than eggs. Cooked with foil for 40 min, removed, topped with more cheese and finished last 15 uncovered.

A tasty and very filling Breakfast Casserole that can be put together the night before a Potluck and baked the next day!  I added Canadian Bacon and used a full dozen eggs.

Made this bc I happened to have all the ingredients. The only issue I ran into was my own mistake and that's that I made the country gravy as directed rather than mixing it w the milk and eggs. So I think any lack of flavor that created was my fault. I will definitely make this one again.

I needed a 9 x 13 size. Next time I will add more sausage/meat at the bottom.  Tried shredded and cubed hashbrowns. Prefer shredded. I used 8 eggs.   Very tasty and it looked Good! People selected mine over another that used bread instead of hashbrowns.

Delicious just the way it’s written. I didn’t change any ingredients but did bake in a 9x13 pan. I put sharp cheddar on top and had to foil the last 10 minutes. It’s a keeper.

Great dish. I cooked the hash browns before adding them and used half a white onion instead of green onions. Also seasoned liberally with salt, pepper, paprika and a little cayenne.

I made this casserole dish for brunch and it was amazing!  I used some of the recommendations that I found common throughout some of the reviews:  I used 8 eggs, covered the casserole with foil for 50 minutes and then cooked it uncovered for the last 10 minutes.  I also used a single, small packet of gravy and that was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!  I will definitely make it again!

I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage and put the hash browns on the bottom. I did add 4 more eggs, which I think wasn’t necessary afterward. I baked uncovered for 30 minutes and then covered it for the last 20 minutes.

Family loved it and it was so simple to make for 6 adults and 3 kids (doubled recipe).  I used egg beaters and accidentally bought the southwestern style egg beaters. Spiced it up and was fantastic! But I know this would be just as wonderful with regular eggs.  It is now a holiday breakfast tradition.  Thank you for this recipe! (would submit a pic but it was gone quickly!)

Five stars for what it is -- a go-to recipe that can, with a few changes, go from breakfast to elegant brunch to week-night dinner.  I opted for the latter, by adding some chopped, mixed vegetables and substituting shallots for the green onion.  Otherwise, I made it as written. Served with a green salad, it was a very tasty, easy recipe that my family enjoyed.

Mixed the eggs and milk in a blender for a lighter bake. Devide the hash browns in half, raw on the bottom layer, quick fry the other half and put them over the egg layer. Adds a bit of crunch to the mouth.

Made this for Easter Brunch and it was a huge hit. I recently had surgery, so my husband had to shop for the ingredients. He had no problem except he couldn't find the sausage gravy mix, so bought a pork gravy mix instead. I didn't think that would quite work, so after I cooked the sausage i added 1 1/2 Tbs of flour to the pan to make a roux, then added 1 1/2 cups of make to make a gravy. I let it cool to room temperature then added it to the egg mixture, poured it in a blender and mixed til smooth, and poured it on per instructions. Worked out great. Will definitely make again.

Great casserole.  As some reviews have suggested; I baked 30 mins., then added cheese, and continued baking as directed.  This helps the hash browns to brown slightly.

This was just OK.   I stayed pretty true to the recipe.   Only change was I added a couple more eggs as other reviewers suggested.   I guess my problem with the finished product was the texture and how all the individual components (the sausage, the hashbrowns and even the eggs just became part of this giant styrofoam-like block.   The purpose of the egg mixture is just to bind it all together and it seeps into every nook and cranny and it binds it alright.   Wasn't too crazy about being able to taste the country gravy flavor so strongly either.   I probably won't make this one again.

Definitely a good recipe.  I agree that the cheese on top gets pretty hard.  If I make this again, I'll try mixing it more with the hash browns .  Also, I thought that there could be more gravy.  I found pockets of gravy in mine.  A little more gravy might have been better.

I added a sliced jalapeno to the layer with green onion, a full bag of Potatoes O'Brien, Jimmy Dean HOT sausage, 2 additional eggs and cooked for almost an hour and 15 minutes at 325. It all fit nicely into a 13 x 9 casserole dish.  Turned out perfect.  No doubt about it when my wife asked for another piece. Very tasty.  Will definitely make again.

I will definitely make this again. For the most part I made the recipe as stated except I used 8 eggs and made it in an 8x8 baking dish per the recommendations of other reviewers. I forgot the green onion, which may have given it the extra oomph it needed.  I had diced potatoes o'brien in the freezer and forgot to thaw them out. So while my sausage was cooking, i put the potatoes on a baking sheet in the oven to thaw and cook just a little bit. 

I will definitely make this again, since it's easy, but I'll try Hot breakfast sausage and maybe some diced green chiles.  Leftovers are great!

This was fantastic. I wanted a recipe with potatoes, not bread, so I gave it shot for Christmas breakfast.  Wow, what a hit. This is now our breakfast for every holiday!!  Served with a fresh fruit plate & yogurt honey sauce and you have a perfect breakfast.

I have made this several times and it has become a requested dish for any breakfast gathering. I mix it all up the night before and just put it in the oven in the morning. I also had success using Pioneer brand Gluten Free gravy mix to accommodate a couple friends with Celiac.  My one tip is that if you increase the servings and put it in a deeper dish you need to up the cooking time substantially. 
Update: Even with the right sized pan and regular recipe it took almost an hour and a half to cook. Still, worth the wait.

This was great. My group don't usually eat casseroles but when I put this one out it was eaten with great gusto??. I didn't have the size dish the recipe called for so I used an 8x8 and cut down on the amount of some ingredients. This is on the "remake" list. Ruby

Loved this. I used 8 eggs and kept everything else the same. I used a jimmy dean sausage roll and simply potatoes shredded hashbrowns. I found it helpful to brown the hashbrowns before adding to the casserole. My husband couldn't get enough of this. It's a keeper. Yum!

Great recipe for a novice! My husband made this according to the recipe. Only changes were using 8 eggs ( per previous reviewers), pre cooked turkey sausage crumbles ( he doesn't eat pork and that was the best substitute available at our local market), and 1/2&1/2 instead of milk (because the teenager had finished off the milk). Now, my husband is not a fool, but he is the guy they're talking about when a recipe is referred to as "foolproof". This came out looking, smelling, and tasting good. And (bonus) my kitchen did not turn into a disaster area in the process.

I really enjoyed this! I followed the suggestions of others and used 8 eggs instead of 6, and I covered it in foil for the first 50 minutes.  After those 50 minutes, I sprinkled on a little more cheese and cooked it another 10 minutes without the foil, and then I broiled it for a minute or two.  I used a mixture of sharp cheddar and taco cheese.  Because I used frozen hash browns, I thawed them by heating them briefly in the pan of grease after removing the sausage.  While this was definitely not a healthy option, I do think it added a little extra flavor.

Very nice starter recipe. Only change I made was making  home-made country gravy from scratch rather than from a packet. We thought the dish was a tad bland, so future  (and I do intend to make it again) versions will likely use either spicy sausage. pepper-jack cheese, or diced poblano peppers.

So very delicious! We are a family of four and we finished this casserole in one sitting. Either we were just really hungry or it was just really delicious...maybe a little of both! Next time, if I can remember,  I would like to add a bit more liquid. Another egg or two? More milk perhaps? So good, though, I hate to change a thing!

I made this exactly like the recipe except... no, I made it as written. I liked it very much, but found it to be a little bland and a little milky. I'm sure I will make this again, but next time I will use hot sausage and maybe do half milk and half water. It was a little confusing for instructions. In the recipe it said to use hash browns, but didn't say frozen or thawed. It also said to use an 8x8 pan. In the video it said to use fresh or thawed hash browns and a cast iron skillet. Well, I used the cast iron skillet and frozen hash browns. Came out fine.

Good recipe.  Since I did not have the country gravy mix, I substituted a brown gravy mix instead.  It may sound crazy, but it still came out great.  The next time I will also add mushrooms of some type.

Made 1/2 the recipes for two. It made enough for two servings each. I did use 5 large eggs.  We loved it.  This one is a keeper.

I added carmalized onions and homemade gravey.  I also added red and black pepper, garlic, and nutritional yeast.  We took it out of the pan, added sour cream and salsa, and made breakfast burritos.  I made a nine by thirteen and it took 9 eggs and I didn't have any milk so I used a half cup sour cream. Was a fun recipe to play with.  It turned out great.

I didn't personally like this over others I'd had. It was way too pepper. The rest of the family seemed to enjoy, though I usually feel more enthusiasm for my dishes. Added the two extra eggs and some more green onions.

It was really yummy! I added 3 more eggs and salt and pepper to the eggs, substituted Monterey jack for swiss and instead of bacon I used a pound of breakfast sausage. 
Next time I will also add some sliced kielbasa....
I recommend making this ahead and just mix eggs in in the morning as it takes quite some time to prep...

I used half the gravy mix, 5 eggs, and seasoned salt to the egg mixture.   Foil lined 11x7 dish, 350 covered for 50 min and 10 uncovered as previously suggested.   Got good reviews from breakfast this morning, I will make this again.

This was a hit with the whole family!  I used minced onions rather than green and sharp cheddar cheese.  Based on reviews I used 8 eggs instead of 6, and it was delicious!

It was my turn, and I was looking for something different for our after-church gathering.  This was rated right up there with the fantastic biscuits & gravy one of the men makes.  I call that a HIT!!  I, after reading reviews, did add two eggs, lightly fried the hash browns with green peppers, salt, pepper, a good chili powder, and increased onions.  I used bacon in one batch & sausage in the other. I baked them in 9 by 13 baking dishes, adding the cheese at the end to just barely brown (still soft).  Made it the night before and "nuked" it at church.  I also served a side of country gravy as I know our church folks love those biscuits and gravy, plus a side of salsa for those who wished for some extra zip.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this morning for Sunday School class.  It was easy and awesome!  Used advice from other reviews, using 8 eggs and Potatoes O'Brien, cooking them first.  Also used more cheese.  Will make again for sure.

Made this for dinner and it was delicious! I would have never thought to mix the gravy with the eggs! I didn't add the peppers because I didn't have any on hand. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly! My husband and 5 year old both had seconds!

Good basic casserole recipe - next time I would skip the gravy mix because we all seasoned it with hot sauce and ketchup, I think it kind of masked the flavour. I would also increase the eggs so it wasn't so heavy on the sausage - maybe 10 eggs to 16 ounces of sausage. I added an onion and a clove of garlic to the sausage as it was browning, then browned the hashbrowns in the sausage grease. Very good - will definitely make again!

Great recipe the way it is (I added some chopped broccoli for a veggie addition)but could be changed up to suit what you're craving or have on hand. Next time I may add ham, mix some salsa in with eggs mixture or hot sauce, chopped tomatoes, jalapeños, red bell peppers, mushrooms, green chilies, etc. or just make it the same way. Can't go wrong. And it's just as delicious re heated next day!

This is a great recipe! It's a hit every time we fix it.  We like to add mushrooms to the beef mixture and a bit more green onion than what's called for.

I made this for a crowd and got no particularly good or bad comments.  Made one with sausage and one with bacon.  Usually if my group of 25 really likes something they tell me, hoping I'll make it again.  Got nothing this time.

This was great! I left out the onions because I don't like them and I used hot sausage. Also the package of hash browns that I bought was more than called for so I just put all of it in. I also forgot to buy milk so I just used water and it turned out fine. The next time that I make this I think that I will add two eggs and use another cup of milk. The liquid mixture didn't seem like enough to cover the entire pan. I did use a bigger pan than called for though.

This is delicious!  I also fried up some hash browns and put them on top. I also used 3 green onions instead of one, added a little bit of red peppers flakes to the hash browns,and it turned out with a lot of flavor. Thank you for the recipe

Very yummy! Followed ingredients to the letter, but I did not let it sit overnight. I assembled and immediately baked it, and thought it came out wonderfully.  Will try again with setting overnight to see if there is a huge difference.

Do you make the gravy mix according to package or just put in the dry mix?

My mother in law was looking for something different for our family breakfast on Saturday mornings.  I printed this out and she made it.  We all enjoyed it.
