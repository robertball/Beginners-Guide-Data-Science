This was a pretty tasty Barbeque sauce. The bacon drippings, cumin and Spanish Paprika really add a depth of flavor. I used it for dipping - not for cooking. The instructions say the flavor changes when cooked for too long, so I went for the sauce more raw. I'd make this again.

I think the bacon drippings are the key to this recipe.  I did not have Spanish parika, so I used smoked paprika instead...this sauce has a lot of depth, and I loved the fresh ginger and soy sauce in this.  I made pulled pork BBQ in my slow-cooker with this sauce!  Unbelievable BBQ sauce recipe!!!

Tangy, peppery and a sweet. Tried it with a can of crushed tomato instead of ketchup as well, and it was still awesome, more smoky and less sweet tasting though.

Pretty good recipe! Too much vinegar though. I doubled the recipe (minus more vinegar) to thin out the vinegar, liked that better! Otherwise very nice with the ginger, soy sauce and seasonings. I will use this sauce on short ribs on the weekend.
