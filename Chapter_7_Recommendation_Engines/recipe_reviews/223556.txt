The only thing missing might be caraway seeds and I will concede they are optional.   After the first rise I felt a loaf pan would be too small so I free-formed the dough.  It did spread slightly but still made a nice boule, substantial but not too dense with a nice crisp crust and moist crumb.  The flavor is really good, there are notes from the molasses and cocoa but they are balanced.  Thanks, this will be made often.

This tastes so much like my Mom's recipe. We increased the chocolate by 1/4 and used corn or flax oil instead of canola (rapeseed) which I can taste and don't like. But the measurements were dead on and the recipe really works well. Thanks

Very nice.  I kept thinking this was a rye bread until I came back to review and realized, nope, not rye, but pumpernickel.  Oh well!  Shared with my coworkers, who loved it.  This makes 2 loaves if you are okay with a small loaf size; I am, so 2 it is for me.  If you prefer a larger loaf, though, it would work in large loaf pans or free form as previous reviewer did.  Nice, basic pumpernickel loaf that was great with cheese and dijon mustard but equally delicious with just some honey.  Proportions worked perfectly for me as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Been looking for a good pumpernickel recipe and this one looked weird enough to try. It turned out great. Not too heavy and very flavourful. Great toasted as well as for making a sandwich. Thanks for posting.

This makes a super dense and delicious loaf of bread.  I also like adding some caraway seeds to the dough, and an egg wash with more seeds on the top.

The only change I might make in the future is to tone down the molasses a bit. Maybe 25% less or so. My other issue was that it came out very dense and didn't rise as much as I would have wanted. that didn't affect the flavor, it just made a slice be heavier than I would have preferred. But overall its a very good bread and I will make it again.

I have made this recipe twice - adding 2 tablespoons of Maple syrup and a hefty sprinkle of caraway seeds, I left out the wheat gluten. Both times it turned out great - will make it again

The molasses flavor was waaaay too strong for my liking. Served it with honey butter which made it a little better. I'll be looking for a different recipe next time though.

This is fantastic!  I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfectly, even though I baked on a cold and rainy day.  It made a very firm dough that only took about 10-12 minutes in the mixer before it tried to climb out of the bowl, so I went ahead and removed it to move onto the kneading phase.  The first rise wasn't terribly impressive, so I was a bit concerned how it would turn out, but an hour in a 9x5 bread pan in a barely warm oven covered with a warm damp dishtowel did the trick.  The texture is firm, but not overly dense and the flavor is very, very good.  You can definitely taste the cocoa and the molasses, as another reviewer mentioned, but it's not overpowering and those flavors are balanced nicely.  I don't think I'll be buying pumpernickel from the store ever again!
