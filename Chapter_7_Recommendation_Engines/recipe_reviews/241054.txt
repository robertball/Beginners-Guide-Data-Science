I wanted a Iemon cookie to add to my cookie gifts and decided on this recipe. I made them lemon lime as I had a lime to use up. I added 1 tsp each lemon and lime zests and 1 tbsp each of lemon and lime juices in the batter.  In the cheesecake part I also added 1 tsp each of lemon and lime zest and 1 tbsp each lemon and lime juice, I reduced the sugar to 3 tbsps and added 12 drops of yellow food colouring to make a nice sunny yellow colour. The cookie is part is too sweet, I would reduce to 3/4 cup of sugar next time. I would also reduce baking temperature to 350 mine needed 12 to 14 minutes to set but the bottoms were browning too fast. I omitted the nuts due to allergies and left the cookies plain. My #60 scoop made 45 cookies.
