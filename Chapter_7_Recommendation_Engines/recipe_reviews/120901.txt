I made this, but used refrigerated cookie dough to make the crust, rolling out per the instructions in the recipe and baking and cooling.  Made the cream cheese filling as stated in recipe and sliced berries as in recipe, but just heated some strawberry jam to glaze with.  It received rave reviews and everyone wanted the recipe!

This recipe is awesome. I made it because it's a personal favorite at a local tea shop, but I think this one is ever better! The only thing I changed was layering the strawberry sauce on top of the cream cheese layer and then the layer of sliced strawberries.

I am giving the taste of this pizza 5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly but did have trouble with the topping.  I had a big gloppy mess and had to thin it down.  I don't know maybe my strawberries weren't juicy enough but I had to add a little water.  It was way too thick.  After thinning this down, I was able to spread it on the pizza.  I will make this again because my whole family loved it but will make a plain strawberry glaze, no crushed berries.

I really liked this, the dough was reminiscent of a sugar cookie, only b/c I swapped the ingredient amounts for the vanilla and the almond extracts.  I chose to add in 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture, but other than those subtle changes this was really good! I chose to place the dough between two pieces of parchment paper -you could also used wax paper, it saves on the clean up, if you don't want to do this, I would use confectioner sugar in place of the flour. I also used a lightly greased tart pan that had a removable insert, instead of the pizza pan. After rolling out the dough, all I had to do was remove the top parchment paper, place the tart pan on top of the dough, and flip the dough into place...quite easy using this method. I pricked the bottom of the dough w/ fork tines before baking, and also pressed the dough up the edge of the pan, but during the baking time the dough "sunk" forming it's own edging.  Great dessert, the only thing I can think of that would make it even better, might be to drizzle some chocolate on top of it.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for dessert and it was a huge hit. I expected to have left overs but people went for thirds. It was also a nice a simple recipe that used things I already had so I didn't have to go shopping.

While this was good I'll stick with fresh strawberry pie.  This really wasn't worth all the work and it produced about the same results as pie.  I was a little confused on the crushed berries, was that 2 C strawberries crushed or 2 C crushed strawberries?  The former created only 1 C.  Since I wasn't sure I reverted to my tried and true gel recipe for the above mentioned pie:  mash enough berries to equal 1 C.  In a saucepan combine 1 C sugar and 3 T cornstarch, slowly add 1/2 C water while constantly stirring; add berries.  Cook over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens. (I'm fairly new to baking with stoneware and made the mistake of using one for this recipe, the crust stuck.)

VERY VERY good! I had a hard time working with the sticky sugar cookie crust but I figured it out and once I did it was so worth it. And for my personal taste I would probably make more of the cream cheese layer next time. Very yummy. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used a prior poster's suggestion and used refrigerated cookie dough for the crust. I was making appetizers, so it would have actually worked out better to make the cookies and make it into "mini" pizzas. Which is what I'll do next time. Very delish and all of them were eaten. :)

I was running short on time so I used a roll of sugar cookie dough. I put a piece of parchment paper on a pizza stone. Then I sliced thin slices of dough forming a pie shape, when complete I just used my finger tips to make sure the dough was sealed together. Next time I think I will double the cream cheese topping.

Loved by my family and friends. I had woken up late and forgot to get a dessert ready for the dinner party we were hosting and I bumped into this recipe and whipped it up in an hour and a half. I thought it would fail because of how fast I had made it but it turned out great. The whole pan was empty by the end of the night.

Adults will revert to childhood and not want to share once they've tasted this dessert.  Well, at least in my circle of friends that's what happened!  We just gave our kids a bite, which leads me to the next point: make two pizzas.

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, but due to time constraints, did not roll the dough, but used my fingers to press it into the pan.  So glad to find this recipe!

This was excellent!  I used refrigerated cookie dough.  I should have cooked it a little longer though (about 15-20 minutes). I didnt use the crushed strawberry sauce and it didn't need it.  My brother said this was the best dessert my sister and I have ever made.

This is fantastic!! I recommend following the recipe as it is written rather than using strawberry jam. It is not hard and it's soooo good! :)

Looks and tastes great.  However the dough was very sticky so I had to roll it out between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap.  After the dough baked, it stuck to my pizza pan and made a huge mess when I tried to serve it.

What a hit! Very Refreshing! I used many types of fruit and no extra jam/topping. I also used sugar cookie dough and it was very easy!

The crust was impossible to roll out even tho I used a ton of extra flour. I ended up just pressing the crust in the pan. Couldn't taste the cream cheese at all. This really tastes just like an almond cookie w/strawberry jelly on the top.

I used one package of pillsbury sugar cookie dough after reading other comments.  it worked well.  i thought the crushed strawberry topping was too much, to the point where it made the pizza a little too sweet and you couldnt even taste the cream cheese.  strawberry jam would serve as a great substitute to the crushed berries (it tasted just like it.)

i will make this again but next time i will either up the cream cheese mixture or half the crushed strawberry topping.  you really do need to put the crushed strawberry mixture on top of the cream cheese before the strawberries on top.  

also, this pizza was better after sitting in the fridge for hours or overnite.  when i tried to serve it after just being done, it was really messy.  

overall, it was a beautiful looking pizza and went over well with my family.

Fantastic! Definitely don't forget to poke a few holes in the crust with a fork before you bake. I forgot to do this and my crust rose more than I would have liked, and was uneven. I don't fault the recipe author for this, since it's definitely SOP when baking and the omission was my mistake. Nonetheless, it came out beautiful and absolutely delicious! The crust took 20 minutes in my non-convection gas oven. I'd check it after 15 if you use convection or your oven seems to run hot.

I arranged the sliced strawberries on the very top for presentation. This is a great recipe that I would definitely make again. Well-deserved five stars!

I made this yesterday for a fortieth birthday dinner.

The "birthday girl" has always had strawberries for her birthday:  chocolate covered, shortcake, etc.

She and the rest of the family rated this one of the best "keepers" from allrecipes.com.

Thanks for sharing the recipe Kara Cooks!!!!!

This was very popular at our house.  The hardest part for me was trying to roll the dough into a perfect circle.  After a few attempts, I was satisfied.  The rest of the recipe went very smoothly.  I was a little worried that the strawberry sauce would make the pizza runny and the crust mushy.  But it turned out perfectly.  This was a very nice, light dessert.

This was pretty good except that 1 cup of sugar was WAY too much for us. If I make it again I would probably cut it down to 1/3 or 1/2 cup.

This was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. I found it to be slightly time consuming but fun to make. I was short on time so I skipped refrigerating the crust dough for 1 hour. It was fine without that step.

Even my husband said he liked this, and he never says that about anything.  I did use stevia instead of sugar and you could not tell at all.

This is so good...to make it easier I also used 1 &1/2 tubes of sugar cookie dough. Then I used 2 small tubs of strawberry cream cheese & mixed it with 1 cup of powdered sugar. After I put the sliced strawberries on I drizzles it with warmed in the microwave strawberry ice cream topping. Divine!

Four Plus Stars!!! I combined suggestions from shortywcb and TRICIA JAEGER - Halved the crushed strawberry sauce (USED 1/2 cup Pureed strawberries) - this seemed to be just enough.  (Neufchatel) Cream cheese flavor came through beautifully!  Agree with lisa, however, when it comes to the dough workability.  Granted, I didn't refrigerate it - but it was IMPOSSIBLE to roll out, so I too just pressed onto the pan.  Light 'N' Refreshing! I will definitely add this to the "Paper" recipe box.

Great Recipe. The only annoying thing was that I had to double the crust recipe. There was also a massive amount of cream cheese mixture left over, and a good bit of strawberry too. There was more than enough of the topping and hardly enough of the dough. I lightly drizzled chocolate (hardshell because I was lazy) over the top and it was a HIT at my girl's night.

Great recipe!  Very easy.  I didn't have a pizza pan so I used my largest springform pan and rolled out ready made sugar cookie dough.  Then I followed baking directions on recipe.  Everyone loved the pizza, but next time I think I will use another members tip and put the glaze over the cream cheese then put strawberries on top.  (I took the time to lay all the strawyberries out and you couldn't even see them.)
