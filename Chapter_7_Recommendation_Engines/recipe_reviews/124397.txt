My wife says this is the best thing I ever made.  I did use a whole lot more (like 5 times more) blue cheese.  I put some white pepper in there also.  Yummy.  I used it primarily for a steak covering...I screwed up and burned the steaks very bad (almost called the fire department), but recovered beautifully with this sauce. We ate every bit of those nasty burnt steaks because of the fantastic sauce. Highly, highly recommend for covereing anything. Thanks!!!!!

This was delicious!! I don't usually have evaporated milk in the house so I used 1/4 cup milk mixed with 1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch. I used 2 tbsp of blue cheese because I like a sronger flavor of the cheese.

What a great pairing! I added WAY more blue cheese to the sauce, just because I love it so much, and the sauce was just perfect. Thick and creamy, strong blue cheese flavor, and just right with steamed asparagus. An elegant side dish that I'll be adding into the regular rotation, that's for sure!

This sauce is to die for.  I've already made it twice this week, first for the asparagus and then again for bleu cheese bacon burgers and also put some on my roasted potatoes.  The second time I made it in the microwave and used cream instead of the canned milk.  this recipe is very flexible and very yummy.

Added more blue cheese, fresh ground black pepper and a little butter. Went great with some grilled steaks. Sauce was good with the steak as well.

Fantastic! Even my mom, who SWEARS she HATES blue cheese, ate this and said it was great.  I used 4 oz. cream cheeze, 1/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tbsp. milk and about 4 tbsp. blue cheese... I modified to my taste, plus I did not have evaporated milk. I will definitely make again!

Very nice and easy dish. Love the blue cheese and asparagus flavors. I tripled the recipe and mixed with cooked linguine and chopped cooked asparagus. Will add this to my favorite recipes.

I was looking for a blue cheese sauce to try with steak and thought I would try this one.  It was WONDERFUL!  I changed the servings to 8 but used two whole containers of blue cheese crumbles.  It made the sauce VERY strong, but that's what I was looking for.  Have passed the recipe on with raves.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I may actually have to start eating veggies!  LOL

I loved it.  Very simple recipe with a great taste.  I didn't have the blue cheese on hand so I substituted 2 tsp of blue cheese dressing and the taste to me was excellant.  It's definitely something I will make again.

I LOVED this. I thought the blue cheese and asparagus flavors went together beautifully. Used a lot more blue cheese than the recipe called for, of course! It's not as good when it cools off, so serve it piping hot!

Do yourself a favor.. make this sauce! We already had the asparagus on the grill when I found this. I did make some adjustments to the sauce and it turned out AMAZING. I melted the cream cheese with 4 tablespoons of butter. Then I added in apprx. 5 tablespoons of regular milk (because it was all I had on hand). I whisked in 2.5 oz of blue cheese to give the sauce a nice bold flavor, and I gave it a dash of white pepper. We put it over our asparagus and our steaks. It would be great on a burger, too! This was fabulous. I will make again and again!

I too tried this for a steak sauce and it was very very yummy and I cant wait to get some fresh asparagus so I can try them with it too.  I also added about 5x the blue cheese the recipe called for because well we love blue cheese..lol.  Very yummy and only had fat free cream cheese and was still very good!  Thanks for sharing!

I did not have evaporated milk, so I just used skim milk.  I am guessing that it did not taste nearly the same, but it ws still ok.  I love blue cheese and anything with it cannot be bad.  I think the evaporated milk would have really added something.

The sauce is the star in this, if you have a blue cheese lover, this is a great sauce to get them to eat veggies they don't like.

My fiancee loved this recipe!!  I added more blue cheese and a little more milk to thin it down and served with small steaks.  It was great!! This will go in my favorites book.

This was a nice alternative for asparagus. You have to be a bleu cheese lover though! It would be great with gorgonzola. I ended up using a bit more bleu cheese and it came out pretty tasty. Even though  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings, it still made a ton of sauce, probably enough for 4 people.

Yum! I made this with pork chops and it was great on both the meat and asparagus. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used dry milk mixed with just a little water to make it thick. Also light cream cheese. It became a little overpowering after a while, but I also used very strong blue cheese.

I was serving steak and had some leftover roasted asparagus.  I doubled the recipe and quickly made this sauce in the microwave using the dish I served it in.  I also used regular milk.  Passed it around and some used it on the veggies, steak and/or baked potato.  You can make it in minutes.

I tried this when I wanted something different than Hollandaise Sauce for my asparagus.  It's extremely easy and tasted great.  You could use the blue cheese sauce with many other recipes.
