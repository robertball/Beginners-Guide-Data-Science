Yummy!  Very good!  The only thing I have a problem with is people who change half the ingredients ( in lots of recipes on this site ) and then say the recipe isn't any good.  How the heck would they know????

I made this recipe AS IS before I made any changes and it was hands down the best chili recipe I have made!! next time though, I put my own little spin on it and I think it elevated it to another level! The recipe as is has a thinner consistency and isn't overly spicy. I added up to 1/2 tsp of cayenne to make it spicier, but what make it out of this world was 1/4 cup corn meal!!! Made it thick like chili you would get in a restaurant. This recipe makes a lot so you can freeze half if need be and is absolutely delicious!!!

I could eat this chili until my stomach bursts!  All the ingredients are in the right proportion; I wouldn't suggest altering a single thing.  Take it to a pot-luck and I guarantee that people will gobble it up.  I like things hot, and I would consider this chili to be about a 5/10 on my scale.  It'll clear your sinuses, but you won't be gulping down milk to cool your tongue!  This recipe heats up well in the microwave, and freezes just fine - we've got three meal's worth in the deep freeze right now.  By all means, give this chili recipe a try, I'm sure you'll like it.

I probably shouldn't rate this recipe because I made so many changes, but it is a great base recipe to tweak to your own liking.  The end result was the best chili I have ever made!!  I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb sausage to give a little more depth to the flavor.  I also followed the advice of others and substituted the tomato juice with tomato sauce and the tomato sauce with diced tomatoes.  I didn't realize that I was almost out of chili powder until I had already started the chili, so I only used about 1 T and added hot sauce (tobasco) in place of the rest of the chili powder.  I used one can of chili beans (with liquid) and one can kidney beans (rinsed).  I followed the rest of the seasonings.  It only took about 15 minutes to put together, then I let it simmer for about 2 hours.  Served with sour cream, cheese, fresh chopped tomatoes and corn chips.  I will make this recipe over and over again.  I have never received so many compliments - on anything I have ever made!!

I won the chili cook-off with this recipe last night. Everyone commented that they liked the combination of spicy and sweet. I adjusted the ingredients to feed 15 people. I also  followed the first couple of reviews and substituted tomato juice for paste, and diced tomatos for juice. FYI, for 15 people, I used 2, 28oz cans of diced tomato, and 2, 29oz cans of tomato sauce. It's a bit thick till it cooks down. Enjoy!!

If I could rate this chili more than 5 stars I would! 5 stars for easy! 5 stars for delicious! I have been making this for over a year and I have tried it different ways. Now I use crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice, and diced tomatoes with diced green chilies in place of tomato sauce. I use 1 can of kidney beans, one of pinto and one of black (all rinsed) in leiu of one of the lbs of beef, thus cutting down on the sat. fat and red meat content. Doubled the cumin because I like the smokiness. I also added one hot jalepeno without the seeds, diced, or cayenne pepper. I throw it all in the crockpot and let it cook for about 4 hours. SPECTACULAR!

I also changed the tomato juice - to tomato sauce...and the tomato sauce to diced tomatoes (no salt added).  Otherwise, followed exactly as written.  This chili was EXCELLENT.  Everyone commented how good it was -- not once, but multiple times -- as they ate two and three bowls each!

This was delicious! Instead of 1 can of tomato juice, we substituted it with 1 can diced tomatoes. It made it nice and thick!

Yummy! 'Nuf said!  I noticed many reviews commented that this recipe is somewhat bland.  I would encourage everyone to double check the age of the spices they're using.  If they're over a year old, you probably need to pump it up a little as spices lose their punch as they age.  I recently noticed a jar of chili powder at my mother's that was probably at least 10 years old.  She didn't see the problem with that.  The problem with that is that she's basically adding slightly flavored dust to her recipes...yuk!  I used fresh spices for this chili and it turned out perfectly tasty and spicy.

Update:  I've been making this recipe consistently for a few years now, and I've found that I'm happiest when I double the beans (Sorry, serious chili lovers), and increase the amount of all the vegetables, plus add 1/4 cup corn meal to thicken it up.  Nevertheless, this recipe is a great starting point that is easy to tweak to your satisfaction.

I found that putting in the same amount of kidney beans as red beans is the way people prefer it.  I also chopped up some steaks and put them in, my husband really liked that.

This definitely is a keeper! Loved it! Here's one thing you can do with this recipe (or any soup recipe that has beans in it) to make it thicker if you just love the taste and don't want to use flour, cornstarch, cornmeal, etc. to thicken it - Put some of the beans in a blender with some of the juice from whatever recipe you are using and puree. Add this to your recipe and you won't really change the taste of the recipe but it will make the broth thicker. If you want to: you can add a few more beans or less beans to make your recipe turn out the way you like.

This is my favorite chili recipe on the entire site. I cut the chili powder in half, used brown sugar as opposed to white,  added a touch of cinnamon and use a little more oregano and cayenne.
Instead the Tomato Juice, I used sauce and petite cut tomatoes. We love this recipe, and always serve it with the Absolute Mexican Cornbread, also on this site. Thank you George... this is truly a winner in my book! It gets a 5, even with my changes!

This is awesome chili! It's a regular beef chili recipe with no frills or cinnamon or any other special ingredients. I omitted the celery and bell pepper because I didn't have them and we were iced in.

I helped my eldest son make this only slightly--he did most of the work himself. We did not add the celery, we used two large red peppers, we used "a mess" of fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and we added one 4 oz. can of mild diced green chilies. We also used black beans because that was all we had in the pantry. After the meat was browned, he threw everything in the crockpot and let it go all day. Very good! We all thought this was one of the better chili recipes we've ever had. I was quite proud of him. This will be his go-to chili recipe from now on.

I needed an amazing chili recipe for a family gathering, and I knew that over a thousand reviews couldn't be wrong.  I followed the recipe closely and added only a small can of diced jalapenos for a touch of heat.  The chili was a big hit!  It was just spicy enough for everyone to enjoy without having to gulp down cold drinks to cool the tastebuds.  I received lots of compliments, which was especially nice because I rarely make chili from scratch.  I made it a day ahead in order to allow the flavors to blend and heated it in a crockpot for the party.  Several guests used the chili to top baked potatoes.  I'll definitely save this recipe for future gatherings!

This is the best basic chili recipe! I changed quite a few things but I know it would have been great without any changes.
I used I 29oz can tomato sauce, 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (with liquid), and a 10oz can of tomato soup. I didnt add the sugar because the condensed campbell soup is already sweet. I did this because I like my chili really thick so I emitted all that juice. The only other thing I changed was 3lbs beef and an extra tsp of cumin to compensate. Everything else was done just like the original recipe......turned out awesome!
I just made this for the second time and have to say, the can of tomato soup makes all the difference for me....dont know why but its a must!

Are you kidding me?! How can something so simple taste so wonderful? This was hands down the best chili I've ever made. Because of the ingredients on hand, I cut the recipe in half (just me and my hubby eating) and used 2 quarts of homemade canned tomatoes w/onion & green pepper in place of the tomato juice & tomatoe sauce. I ran my hand blender through the tomatoes before adding to the pot because I like them chopped up small. I added a pat of butter and topped with Oyster crackers. Oh, my gosh it was great last night when I made it, but it's even better today for lunch! Do yourself (and your family) a favor and try this one today!

Made some changes based on other reviews - I used 1 lb beef, 1 lb mild italian sausage.  I used 2 cans of diced petite tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato sauce.  I used one can dark Kidney beans and 1 can chili beans w/ medium sauce.  Drained/rinsed kidney beans but adding the sauce from the chili beans.  I dbled all spices, cooked meat in Worchestir sauce, used only a 1/2 cup of onion (not huge onion fans), 1 green pepper cut into md chunks, no celery (husband doesn't like it)  I cooked the meat, spices, onion and green peper in the skillet, then combined it w/ the sauce and beans.  Cooked for 3 hrs on high, then 2 hours on low in the crockpot.
half hour before it was done, I added a 1/4 cup of cornstarch since it was a little watery to my liking - next time I will drain the diced tomatoes so it won't be so watery.
Brought to friends house for dinner and everyone loved it.  Husband said it was the best chili I've made yet.  Hostess said it was just the right amt of heat for her.  
i was running late so whipped this up and into the crock pot in only 20 min - super easy to make.

This is a great chili recipe. Its close to the one I've been using forever. If you add a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, you cant go wrong with this. I do use pinto or black beans. You can also add a can of corn if you want. I also like to add 2 chopped jalapeno peppers.

A good basic recipe to build from - I used 1lb Turkey instead of 2 lbs Beef - doubled the amount of beans - used white beans and red beans (it's all I had) and doubled the cayenne - I'll have fun tweaking this recipe

This was the best chili EVER!!!!!!I didn't add the celery instead i added 2 chopped red peppers. Instead of garlic powder, I used freshly minced garlic. Instead of red beans, I used black beans because that was all we had. I added a 4 oz. can of green diced chilies. I loved this meal sooooo much that I wanted seconds [but got full after my roll and the bowl of this chili]. My parents were VERY proud of me.

I've made this twice now and I think it's going to be my new standby. I noticed a lot of folks didn't use quite the same volume of juice that the recipe calls for, but I used V8 juice for the tomato juice. It was perfect, still thick enough to be hearty, but not so thick that it was like sloppy joes. This is just such a great basic recipe and I am so happy to find it. Cornbread on the side makes for one delicious meal.

This was a great basic chili recipe! Reminds me of my mom's. I changed a couple things. I used a large can of tomato sauce instead of the juice and 2 cans of diced tomates. I omitted the celery and added more green peppers. I cooked in the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours. Turned out great!

This is the best basic chili recipe I have ever used.  You can make it to suit what you have on hand and add to it for bigger crowds.  I usually vary the tomatoes with what I have in the pantry using whole, diced or stewed and sauce.  I also use more beans than called for to stretch it for a crowd.  I use 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey to make it slightly healthier.  This is not a spicy chili but I keep a bottle of tabasco out with the toppings for folks to make it to thier liking.  Overall, its the BEST!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with one addition- about 2 TBS of chopped pickled jalapeno for added zing.  FABULOUS!  DH and I loved it.  It didn't have the overpowering chili powder taste.  Oh, and I thickened it up a bit with some masa flour as was previously suggested. Thanks for our new favorite chili!!!!

This is the best chili ever! It has the perfect amount of flavor and takes out the guess work. I made it for the super bowl and everyone loved it. My friend is convinced we should enter our town chili cook off with this recipe and based on other reviews I think we would win. I did change the recipe a little based on my own liking and on some of the reviews I read. I used 1 lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of ground sausage. I like chunky tomato's in my chili so I replaced 1 (46 fluid ounce can of tomato juice) w/ 28 oz. can diced tomatoes and 18 oz vegetable juice. I used a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cayenne instead of 1/8 teaspoon. Lastly I added 1/4 cup cornmeal. This one is a keeper for me. Thank you for a great recipe!

Living in Belgium, I had to make one tweak to the recipe. After the ground beef finished browning, I drained it, then added 3/4 of a bottle (about 8 oz) of beer. I let that come to a boil for a bit, then put that concoction into the kettle and added the other ingredients as directed. I used a blonde beer, but next time I will use a darker beer (whatever you use, make sure it's 'quality' beer). Either way, I think that gives this excellent chili recipe an extra layer of flavor.

Made this without changing anything, very flavorful, easy to make, after I browned the hamburger, I just threw everything in slow cooker on high for 4 hours.  It was a hit to all including neighbor who came by.  Will definately make this as again!

I just made it for the first time tonight and my husband raved!!! This was very good, I am highly impressed.. The suggestion to add the 1/4 cup of corn meal made it.. He loves his chili thick and that did the trick!! It was very thick, and had just enough kick..I will def. be sticking with this recipe!

I think this Chili is fantastic. One of the best I have ever made.
I cooked it early in the day and then allowed the flavours to develop flavour nicely until I needed to reheat it later in the evening.
Superb!

Fabulous!  I have made approx 8 times.  Only mods that I have made is to add a can of diced tom's, and more vegetables.  If you allow it to simmer for approx 3 hours, then the excess liquid from the tom juice reduces which makes the ingredients "get happy".  Heat level is perfect for us, but some may need to kick it up.  We top with fresh diced tom's, corn chips, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.  Super recipe!

This is a very good, simple, mild/medium chili recipe. As others have suggested, I like to substitute tomato sauce and diced tomatoes (in juice) in equal proportions for the tomato juice and sauce because I like my chili thick! If you prefer a more soupy chili, the original recipe will serve you well.

I originally had this chili as the recipe is written at my sister's house.  I ate three big bowls in the two days we were there.  It is a very balanced, very agreeable chili.  I have a big pot of it on the stove right now that I changed just a little (added diced tomatoes and used half ground pork) and my house smells amazing.  Can't wait for tonight by the fire with my beautiful wife, a good movie and a bottle of Regusci zinfandel, a gift from my brother-in-law.

I was looking for a good, basic chili recipe to take to a chili potluck this evening.  This one looked like the right one.  I didn't realize it but the potluck was actually a chili cookoff.  Guess who won first place?  That's right, me.  I also did not use tomato juce but did the tomato sauce and canned tomatoes instead.  I added a can of beef broth and tomato paste in place of 1 can of tomato sauce. I used red bell pepper since I prefer that flavor when cooked and I usually add jalepenos but was out so I also added 1 can of hot "Rotel" to spice it up.

This turns out to be 5 stars if you follow what most reviewers do.  And what I did.  Substituted the tomato juice with tomato sauce and the tomato sauce with diced tomatoes.  I also cut the chili powder in half and found that to be more than enough!  But that is a matter of the chili makers preference!!  Thanks sumbitter.

The only thing I changed was I added a can of diced tomatoes. After making it I could not stop eating it. Went back to the pan 5 times while it was cooling, after I already ate a bowl of it. Delicious!!

This is amazing!!! I love chili and wanted to finally make my own. In search of chili recipes and reading over many of them, this recipe caught my eye and I thought to give it a try...thank goodness I did. My husband is not a big fan of chili and he was loving every taste. I mostly used the ingredients as stated, but I did do a few modifications. Instead of Tomato juice, I substituted it with tomato sauce and subbed the tomato sauce with diced tomatoes. I used kidney beans and red beans (next time I will try a mix with black beans). I added 1/4 cup of cornmeal as suggested by a previous reviewer because I love thick chili. Also, I added 4 pieces of cooked bacon (which I cooked in the skillet and once it was done, I added the bacon grease to the ground beef while I was browning the meat) and a tablespoon of Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. This was a wonderful recipe and I can't wait to make this again for my family and friends.

This is great chili. I've done the recipe exactly as it states as well as used my crock pot for it as well. When I do the crock pot I use dry beans that have soaked over night and we normally make chili the day before we plan on eating it. We let it sit overnight in the fridge to let the flavors marry then we warm the chili up before dinner. Yummy.

This was my first chili I ever made and this recipe was great!  I changed some of the tomatoe ingredients to make it thicker but the spices were right on.  I use the crock pot and we freeze the leftovers (if there are any!)

This was really good.  We all enjoyed it quite a bit, over pasta with cheese.  Hubby did use a dash of hot sauce.  Fair warning, this makes a big batch of chili.

Nice and spicy!  My husband loves spicy foods and this definitely hit the spot.  I put more of the hot peppers in than was called for, but I think the recipe is actually just right spice-wise.

This recipe is fantastic!  I did cut the amount of tomato juice added to 1/2 the amount the recipie called for. I also added a small can of tomato paste and 1 can diced tomato... the result, a thick amazing chili that my hubby and I could not stop eating! : )

I loved this chili recipe.  It is easy and very flavorful.  The only modification I made to this was that I used fresh garlic (about 6-7 cloves), ground red pepper instead of cayenne, and I added 1 chopped serrano chile pepper.  It was fantastic.  For those who said the chili was too liquidy, if you let it cook down for about 2 hours, some of the water will evaporate off giving a thicker chili.

Best ever chili, hands down! I did what many reviewers suggested by using tomato sauce instead of juice, and petite diced tomatoes instead of sauce. I've made it several times, and it's always a hit. I even won a family cook-off with this recipe! All of the ingredients are in perfect proportion, and you just can't go wrong as long as you stick to the instructions. Thanks for a wonderful chili recipe! :)

Great chili recipe. It's very similar to the oe I grew up eating. I skipped the green peppers & celery. I added diced tomatoes. I took anothers suggestion to puree a can of kidney beans since I don't like biting into beans. I also replaced the other can of beans with green beans- just because I usually do and I really like them.
UPDATE: I brown the meat the night before and put everything in the crockpot.  In the morning I take the crockpot out and put it in the warmer to let it cook all day. Wonderful!  Have made it a few times since the original.

As a lover of chili, I have to say that this is a GREAT recipe!  It was easy and quick to put together. The flavors were clasic chili all the way. Unfortunately, my family is scolfield (sp?) handicapped and I was forced to cut back on the chili powder.  Using corn meal, (1/4 c.), to thicken the chili about 10-15 minutes before taking it off the heat, really made it thick and hearty.  For all you chili lovers out there, stop searching and fire up the stove!

Just made this again for the second time and was on the site so I HAD to come and leave the review.  not that after 923 reviews mine will even be read but it deserves it! lol  This chili is the best chili I have had!!  I do make a few changes... 1 lb or meat and 3 cans of beans pinto light and  dar kidney beans, less chili powder, skip the cumin, use brown not white sugar  and add more, also add chopped mushrooms.  My husband had  been stuck on HIS chili for so long and I hated it well being pregnant I decided to give a new recipe a shot and  even he loves  it!

I have made this several times and, accordingly, it has evolved. For one, when you make any sort of stew/curry, you should sweat the veggies with salt (get all the water out). Mix the dry seasonings with the meat and add  to the sweated veggies over high heat until the meat gets nice and browned. Again, this means getting the water out and you should start to get some brown bits sticking to the pan. This condenses the flavors and the direct heat on the spices bring out their oils, intensifying their flavors. Then add your wet ingredients scraping up those browned bits from the side of the pan. I never discard fat. That's just throwing away flavor.  Tonight, I will add chopped fresh oregano and fresh garlic before serving to give it a little zing.

Things I add: tbsp cocoa powder, pinch of cloves, smoked paprika.
Things I sub: ground pork or chorizo for part of the ground beef, pasilla or anaheim chiles for bell pepper, beer for tomato juice, diced tomatoes instead of sauce.

This was easy, just as promised and a huge hit in my house. I made it two weekends in a row becasue kids were eating after sports practices (like instead of junk) and I thought wow, what a great change to choose to eat something in which sugar isn't the first ingredient! Great job...made as is!

I only give it 4 stars but with the changes I made, it would be 5: tomato sauce sub for juice and canned diced tomatoes subd for the sauce, half of the meat sausage, and I only used abt2 Tbls of chili powder instead of the 1/4 cup cuz I have young kids and we do not enjoy the spiciness. I can't imagine how hot it would be with the whole  1/4 cup! Also, I didn't have cayene pepper, so I added 1/4 tsp Tobasco and added a couple of Tablespoons of cornmeal to thicken as another reviewer suggested. It did turn out delicious and there was enough (without doubling) for 2 families. Will definitely use this recipe from now on.

This was the first time I made chili and I cooked it for poker night at my house. It was a huge hit and there were no leftovers! The only thing I added was a can of black beans and 2 cans of chili beans since I like alot of beans in my chili. 5 stars from me!

Wonderful Chili Recipe! I left out the celery and the oregano as not my style and instead of the tomato juice I used a can of stewed tomatoes.  I've been raised on Texas Chili so this recipe came close to what I am use to.  It is a little spicy, so if you don't like so much heat then just take out some chili powder is all..Will make again for sure.

This is a very good, very basic recipe. I used a bottle of spicy V8 juice in place of the tomato juice. Next time I will use more beans and maybe a little tomato paste. This recipe is a great source of Lycopenes. Thanks for a good, healthy recipe.

Made this Chili today for family as we watched the Football games and it was spectacular. Although I usually am a firm believer in trying the recipe exactly how it is written before making any changes, I had some Hot Pork sausage that needed to be used so I used it in lieu of half the ground beef and it was AWESOME! I really think the fact that i used HOT pork sausage made a huge difference. It had a really nice kick to it. Oh and I also didnt have Tomato juice so i threw in a can of Diced tomatos with green chiles.

Very tasty!  Not too spicy but you can adjust your own heat!  I used salt free juice to cut some of the sodium.  Everyone had their choice of toppings, sour cream, hot sauce, chili powder, onions, crackers and Fritos. Hubby even grilled some hot dogs for chili dogs too.  Served with a salad and cornbread.  UPDATE OCT 2014:  Wonderful tweak to this fall comfort food was using half ground beef and half Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage.  Delicious twist on a favorite!  #AllstarsJville, #JvilleKitchens, #Fall

This is such a good chili recipe.  I think it's the first time I've made chili without using some type of canned tomatoes but just tomato juice and tomato sauce.  I followed the recipe to a T and it was absolutely delicious!  Definitely will make again!

I'd give this 5 stars! Excellent taste. I would add another type of beans; maybe pinto or black beans and some salsa for added flavor. This is great though.

Loved this. So yummy. The only thing I did different was substitute a bottle of beer and a can of stewed tomatoes with jalapenos for the tomato juice. Otherwise, made as directed! Thank you for sharing!

Don't use ground beef! Try ground chuck or ground round.  Ground beef is to low in quality and lacks taste.

Wow.  Better than another recipe I had tried on this site.  I did not have tomato juice so I added a cup of beef broth.  The celery is such a refreshing add.  I sprinkled with cheese and ate with some cornbread.  What is a flatlander?...a human?  Thanks for the formula.

I love this recipe!  I did boil dry kidney beans instead of using canned, and I substituted sauce for tomato juice.  I also added diced tomatoes.  That is not what I would call "changing the recipe," it is just our personal preferences.  All the seasonings are original to the recipe...none added, none omitted.  This is the best chili recipe!!!

Excellent chili!! I serve this Chili in a carved out fresh bakery bun. I don't do the pasta part. I also use strained tomato puree instead of a can of tomato juice.

My husband LOVED this. I make it with ground turkey instead and it tastes great and light. My honey praised it so much I made it for my parents and my mom could not believe it was turkey. Served traditionally with cornbread... yum, yum!

I've been using this recipe for some time now and it is always a hit. I've given the recipe to several people who always say it's the best chili they've had.  I did make some changes, some minor, some major that make it even more amazing than it already is:
I put half ground beef, half hot italian sausage
I use canned tomatoes with juice in place of the tomatoe juice because I like the chunks of tomato.  
Other than that I make it as is...sometimes I half the amount of cayenne pepper for myself because I find it a little spicy but 90% of the people who have had it say the spice is perfect.  Great recipe

Wonderful Chili!  I have made this probably 10 times now.  It is great as written.  If you like things a little more spicy, increase the cayenne and/or add tobasco.  I also like a little more veggies in mine, so I add more onions and peppers.  Personal preference.   I highly recommend!

Was etable... but... Waaaaaaay too soupy for us. Omit the tomato juice and add a couple can of diced tomatoes instead. Also had too much chili powder and cumin for our tastes. I used V8 in place of plain tomato juice and left out the celery and green pepper; and as always, grated the onions (for my picky eaters)... lol.

Best chili ever!!  The only thing I have changed in the many times I've made it is to add more beans....I use about 6 cups of beans....3 c dark kidney, 1 1/2 c light kidney, and 1 1/2 c pinto.  Everyone loves it....even the kids!

This is the best chili I've ever tasted!  Absolutely delicious!  The only "change" I made was to add more green pepper/onion/celery than was called for.  This one is definitely a "keeper!"

Simply great. I love how sweet it is, and added an extra pinch or two of sugar to help it along. 

It's amazing how the meat flavor embraces the tomato. I was overly worried that since there was so much tomato sauce / juice that it wouldn't taste like chili. 

This recipe is perfect.

Loved it.  I use turkey instead of beef.  But I can only imagine how yummy beef would have been.  I served it over Trader Joe's corn chips (aka Fritos) and cheese on top.  I call it a Frito Boat.

It's a keeper. The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half except keeping the 2 cans of beans. My husband ate 3 bowls -- I had 1-1/2 and we still had ample leftovers. I always serve my chili over rice.

This is a great recipe! I adjusted it for 15 people and only substituted 3 crushed garlic cloves for the powder. Also the vegetables and garlic were sauteed with the meat. Everything was put in a crockpot and cooked on low for 9 hours. I think the tomato juice was what made it so good. I did not add anything to thicken it. I will definitely make this again!



Made this again with ingredients for 15 but kept tomato juice at original recipe proportion. It was even better this time around. Don't change a thing!

Will make again.  Followed many reviewers' suggestions to replace the tomato juice with diced tomatoes.  It was the right amount of spiciness for everyone (those who like it hot and those who don't!).

This is the best chili ever!  I have been looking for a recipe that my kids would like since I love chili and they don't...this is THE ONE! It is so good!  I did use 1/2 and 1/2 beef and turkey tho, 1/2 of the called for amount of tomato juice and cut the chili powder some for the sake of my kids. Perfect combo of spice and sweet...Just a great meal!

Making this for dinner tonight in the crock pot!  The only ingredient I didn't have in stock was the tomato juice, so I used canned diced tomatoes instead.  I've done a taste test or two in the past hour and OMGosh it is so yummy!!  Might be a tad too spicy for my 7.5yr old tho' since he's not fond of spicy, so next time I might tone it down a bit.

This replaces my favorite overnight oven chili recipe because it is not nearly as time consuming to make, has a short ingredient list with items I tend to already have in the pantry, yet tastes almost exactly the same as my old favorite!  You've made my life easier with this recipe!--Thank you for posting it!

Made this multiple times since finding the recipe.  Very versatile and love it.  Made exactly according to directions first time, even though I thought it was a lot of juice and chili powder.  It was good, but the second time, I cut the juice in half, and only used about 3/4 of the chili powder.  It was quite good.  The last time I made it, I left out all beans so my daughter would eat it.  We enjoy adding corn, macaroni, rice, green onions, cheddar cheese, or sour cream to the individual servings.  Finally found a recipe my whole family will enjoy.  Thanks!

A good recipe when you omit the cumin and add corn. My boyfriend and I both thought there was something missing, but this may be due to the fact that I rinsed the canned beans this time, and never have before. We enjoyed this chili, but would spice it up next time.

BEST HOMEMADE CHILI EVER!!!  i have made this countless times, and passed the recipe on to dozens of people and everyone who had tasted it has made it their standard chili recipe...only things i change are:  i use crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes, and omit the sugar...i use a little extra cayenne just because i like stuff quite hot; this is a brilliant recipe!!!  thank you!!

I have made this several time, tripling the amount for large groups. I use diced tomato instead of the juice as some have recommended and have received many requests for the recipe.

Excellent. I did double the spices for more kick. Also added 2Tbs hot sauce. My brother who is a picky eater could not get enough. It makes a lot! But it was all gone after 6 people indulged! I would definitely make again.

This is the best Chili recipe I've found. It's the one I use for the Fire Department's annual Christmas party. They keep asking me to make it so there's a 5 star rating from the entire department!!  Little do they know how simple it is and I'm not going to tell them. The extra (rarely is there any) freezes well. Makes great chili dogs and chili cheese fries too. It's just a good all around recipe that reminds me of Wendy's.

Beats, hands down, the chili seasoning packets I had used for years..plus far less expensive in the long run.
Thanks George for sharing your recipe..this is such a great site..I could spend hours reading reviews and suggestions on recipes..feels like a community rather than just a cookbook!!!

Family loved it and not too spicy - just enough kick. My teenaged daughter even asked me to pack it for her  lunch the next day. Liked the simplicity of recipe that besides cooking beef, all other ingredients thrown in together at the same time to cook. Made it exactly as is - other then cooked on medium heat for half hour with pot uncovered to thicken it. Just FYI, leave the tomato juice - don't substitute. It has a very high vitamin C content - another great way to sneak vitamins in your family's food!

This is It! After trying several different recipes I've found my go to chili! Made a few slight changes but pretty much prepared as written here. Added a can of mushrooms and 4 cloves of Garlic. Used ground beef as well as some leftover roast I had. Used twice as much green pepper as called  for and a little more tomatoe sauce. Adjust to what you like but if your not adventorous make as directed and you will not be disapointed. I found it to be medium spicy so watch the cayene pepper! You can always add more later. Thanks very much for posting! Excellent!

How in the world a simple chili recipe like this can be so special is miraculous to me. This is delicious. I subbed ground buffalo, added mushrooms, and replaced celery with some dried coriander. It is a perfectly flavored chili.

When I think of chili, this recipe is it! I LOVE it! I did change the tomato juice to tomato sauce and I added a bit of Smokehouse BBQ sauce to it for a mild smokey flavour. Other than that, I followed it exactly. It is fantastic!

I stuck this in my recipe box last year and finally got around to making this. With the suggestion from Debi P. to exchange the tomato juice for sauce and sauce for diced tomatoes, this turned out EXCELLENT! I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cajun seasoning to the mix, cooked the beef with Italian seasoning, and used B&M Kidney Beans instead of the red beans. I put this in the crock pot instead of a kettle, let it cook on high for 3 hours, then on low for another hour. Since the kiddo can't eat hot stuff, we waited until we plated our bowls to add Tabasco sauce. A little sour cream, and voila! Dinner is served. Easy peasy. And lots of leftovers!

This is the best chili I've ever had, and my husband agrees!!!  I follow the recipe, except I don't add the sugar.  I cook the beef then add everything to my crockpot on low for several hours, and it's even  better reheated the next day!  I serve with sour cream and shredded mild cheddar, and black bean & garlic flavored tortilla chips.

After reading the recipe and several reviews, I tried it with a few suggested tweeks -- what a hit! I've made it several times and my family and friends have all declared this to be their favorite chile ever, with just the right blend of flavors and texture. I used a 28 oz. can diced tomatoes, a can of tomato soup and a 15 oz. can tomato sauce for the liquids, left out the cumin, but kept everything else as stated. It freezes well (when I was able to make it and put it up without family knowing). I look forward to this go-to dish during the cold winter nights ahead. Thanks!

This chili is awesome. I will admit I didn't do it quite as described but it was so good I have to give the original 5 stars. I used 3 pounds lean ground beef, a large can of tomato sauce, a large can of Rotel, no onions/celery/peppers, and I used a can each of black beans, dark red kidney beans, and pinto beans. Also browned the meat and then threw it all in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours. It was so good I've made it twice in two weeks and each time my guests raved about it. It's perfect with or without small Frito chips, shredded cheddar cheese and even sour cream. Love it!

I kind of winged it at the store before even looking for a chili recipe so i didn't have the celery or tomato juice for this recipe. I simply left the celery out and substituted two 10 oz cans of tomatoes with chilis with the juice along with the other ingredients that I did have. This was an easy recipe to follow and the results were great. I am not a fan of chili but my husband likes it and i was glad to have this to make for him before he heads to work on a cold and wet night. I had a huge bowl myself and will probably have seconds. I garnished the chili with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and chopped green onions.

awesome chili recipe! i don't care for cooked peppers, so left that out and added some diced tomatoes. also, i didn't have time stand at the stove... so i browned the meat first then cooked the whole thing in the crockpot on low for ~6hrs. topped with canned jalapenos, cheddar, and sour cream and served with corn bread. so good!!

My fiance said it was the best homemade chili he has ever had, but still prefers the canned variety. I thought the flavors were good. Made in the crockpot. Used tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice.

This chili is a great way to sneak some veggies in your diet! I make it all the time, most recently I only had a pound of ground meat so I chopped up some fresh summer squash and carrots for it (boil carrots first or they'll be crunchy)! I also used more of the other veggies, & had chili without the guilt of too much red meat!

This is a great recipe as is.  It is easy to modify based on your personal tastes, with a variety of modification possibilities.  It freezes and stores very well also.  I'll be making this one a lot!

Made this recipe almost exactly as written - added a red pepper and can of diced tomatoes. It was excellent. Not too spicy, so if you like hot, grab your tabasco sauce. If you just like a good, meaty chili, you won't be disappointed in this recipe.

We made this for dinner lastnight and all of us agree that this is the BEST chili we've had in a long time. We just added a can of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of mushrooms.

I made this with a few minor changes based on the other reviews (1 lb sausage & 1 lb beef, tomato sauce instead of juice & diced tomatoes where it called for sauce). It was so delicious!

the recipe in itsself is good..had 2 up chili powder and cumin 2 my personal preference. also added a teasp of paprika, couple tablespoons of chopped jared jalepanos,used 4 6 oz cans of tomatoe juice w/ 24 onces of petite diced tom & chilis and half cup of water instead of the 46 oz of tomatoe juice.  along w the 2 cans of tomatoe sauce called for.  did not used tomatoe paste also ised 1 can of kidneys and 1 can of black beans rinsed and drained..in the crock pot now..rated this 5 stars with the changes if done as called 4 i would have given it a lower rating don't think it would have been thick enough or had enough chili/cumin flavor

I love this recipe and have been making it for about a year now and I get great reviews. Very yummy. The only difference I made was as others suggested to substitute the tomato sauce for juice and diced tomatoes for sauce. Love it!

I had never made chili before and actually had never had any that I liked but my husband had a craving so I found this recipe and went for it. It turned out fabulous! The only thing I did differently was halve it, omit the celery (I don't care for it) and as others suggested substituted the tomato juice for sauce and the sauce for a can of diced tomatoes. I also added 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. Fished it with shredded cheese and sour cream and even I was wanting seconds! Delicious!

This is a good base for a Chili recipe, but you need to add your own touches or it doesn't have that kick to it. 
I skipped the tomato juice and used two cans of plain tomato sauce. I found that the vegetable ratio was way too low. If you cut the recipe in half, it calls for only 2 tablespoons of green pepper for a serving size of 5! That is not nearly enough to get the taste and texture of the peppers in the Chili. 
I think I easily quadrupled the celery, peppers, and onion. I chopped up 3 different colors of peppers (red, yellow, and green) to add a nice visual appeal. 
I used fresh chopped garlic, instead of powder. I also added a few tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and a bouillon cube. I added more of the hot spices to it as well because it was just too bland as is. 
I served it with white rolls on the side and sour cream to put on top. With the additional changes it was easily a 4-5 star Chili. The recipe as written though is simply average. People who do not like a lot of spice might find it perfectly fine. I needed to give it quite a kick to make it work for me though. 
I will definitely make it again with my own additions of course. Thanks for the recipe George!

This was very tasty. I left out the cayenne as my wife can't do spicy, (I leave the Crystal's on the table for each to add to their own bowl) and I only had 1 can of red beans so I substituted a can of northern beans. Hands down this is a very good receipe

This was a big hit! My husband even asked to bring some for lunch the next day. I used kidney beans instead of red beans, I didn't have chili powder or tomato juice. I just added some water instead. I am definitely making this again! Next time I might add a bit more cayenne pepper to be more daring.

This was excellent.  I had to alter it slightly when I realized I didn't have any cayenne, but it was good.  I used a whole 64 oz bottle of tomato juice (that's what it came in and we don't drink tomato juice straight).  Also omited the cayenne (just didn't have any), and eyeballed the green pepper and probably ended up with 1/2 a cup.  Also took another reviewer's advice and added about 1/3 cup of cornmeal towards the end to thicken - that was AWESOME!  but be careful to add that very slowly, otherwise it clumps.  This is a big time keeper.

Excellent chili recipe!  I used v8 juice instead of tomato juice because thats all I had, and I omitted the cayenne pepper because of the kids, but it still turned out very good.  My 4 year old ate 3 bowls!

I couldn't find tomato juice, so I used 24 ounces of tomato paste and used quite a bit of water, maybe 6 cups.  Turned out pretty good.  I thought it was ok, but my husband really liked it.

Great texture and taste. However, I increased cayenne to 1/2 tsp and added a minced jalapeno pepper, and it still wasn't spicy enough for my taste - spice lovers be warned, you will need to add more hot stuff.

this is everything chili should be.  was worried kids would balk at spiciness but a dollop of sour cream solved it.  didn't add as much tomato juice as called for just per preference for thicker.

I love this recipe!  Everyone who has tried my chili raved about how good it is.  The only thing I change is that I use diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice because I prefer it a bit chunky..I use the same amount of diced tomatos as I do sauce (so, for 10 servings, I use 29-30 oz of diced tomatoes and sauce each).  It's so good and I find it to be pretty healthy too.  I usually make a huge pot and it lasts us several days.

best chili I've ever had. Even beats my mom's recipe. I added cheese, of course, but also canned pineapple chunks. I love the extra sweet taste.

Like others I substituted and used tomato sauce for the tomato juice and diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce only because this was what I had in the house. I am not a very good cook and it is a family joke that I always have PB&J on hand after I try to make a new recipe. Well, my family LOVED this chili and my husband told me it was the best meal I have made in 12 years of marriage. Thank you!!!

This is wonderful chili!! I didn't have all of the ingredients so I improvised (added a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice, northern beans instead of kidney, and added a small can of corn) but it was hands down the best chili I've ever made! So delicious!  This is my recipe from now on!

We printed this recipe over a year ago, and have used it about a dozen times since then- it's become our standard chili recipe.    Based on other reviews, we swapped 46ozs of tomato sauce for the tomato juice and 29oz of crushed tomato for tomato sauce.  We also prefer the taste of fresh garlic to garlic powder, so we mince up a couple of cloves.  We do not find the sugar necessary, but that probably depends on how sweet or bitter your particular batch of tomatoes is.  I'd add that at the end, if necessary at all.    The chili made this way has a great texture and spice balance.  It's got a ton of flavor, but isn't too spicy.  If we're cooking for ourselves, we double the cayenne.  I love that the heat is one of the flavors, but does not overpower the other seasonings- great balance.    When making this recipe for a crowd (which I highly suggest) we kept it warm in a crock pot on our buffet.  Worked out very well.  As other reviewers mentioned, this also freezes beautifully!

I love my own chili recipe but desperately needed to cut off my McCormick's Chili seasoning "addiction".  It was getting too expensive & was tasting too salty lately.  Anyway, I just needed to find a chili seasoning recipe and this was perfect.  I didn't follow the rest of the recipe; however, I'm giving this 5 stars because it served my purpose of replacing the McCormicks.  For my own chili recipe, I use both diced and stewed tomatoes; brown sugar vs. white sugar; a touch of cinnamon; roasted jalapeno peppers and finish it off with crushed Fritos and cheese.

I think this is more of a 4 1/2 recipe, but I made a few changes so can't vouch for the original. The changes I made were partly out of necessity, part based on other reviews, and part just cuz. I don't know exactly how much beef I used, but I'm guessing between 2 1/2 and 3 lbs (I had bought a 5 lbs roll, and it was what was left) I couldn't find plain red beans, so I bought a 2lb can of chili beans, and just added them all in, didn't think to drain and rinse em. I also didn't bother to measure the green pepper, just used a whole one. I used an whole onion and 1/2 onion, cuz I had a half onion in the fridge I wanted used up, and the whole onion measured up a tad bit short. And, I added an extra tsp cumin, doubled to oregano, sugar and cayenne. Also, since my husband ended up working late, the chili ended up simmering closer to 3 hours. This didn't hurt it a bit. Usually when my husband comes in late, he's to tired to eat much, but he downed 2 big bowls and actually wants the left overs for dinner tonight. I few reviews mentioned that it was thin and watery, I didn't have that problem, but it maybe because I tossed in a few extra solids. T. It's not a hot chili, but does have plenty of flavor, which is how I like it but the chili powder still kinda overwhelms everything a bit for my taste, so next time I make it, I'll probably scale it down just a teeny bit.

This chili was perfect! The only thing I did differently was add a little more cayenne pepper and everyone thought it was faculous. Having made and tried various chili recipes throughout the years, I would say this is a definite 10!

Made a half recipe and it was awesome!  I used an entire can of red beans, and I didn't have the tomato sauce on hand so I used extra tomato juice and a can of diced tomatoes instead.  I used more green pepper and celery than the recipe  listed for extra flavor.  Cooked most of the day (probably 6 hours or so).  Every once in awhile I tasted it and added salt, ground black pepper, or Lawry's seasoned salt if it tasted like it needed it.  GREAT!

I hate it when people rate something and then tell about all the changes they made but in this case they were minor and just a preference choice. I used tomato sauce and hand crushed canned plum tomatoes. This is a very good chili recipe that is impossible to screw up and make anyone think you've been making chili for years.

Delicious. Used some of our homegrown tomatoes, diced, added a can of green chiles, and used half turkey (ground) with the lb of ground beef....very good chili, great flavor. This would also make a great slowcooker 'on the go' meal. Thank you.

Out of all the different chili recipes i have tried i like this one the best. I used V-8 tomato juice and the only change was adding diced tomatoes (the one roasted w/ garlic and peppers)to it because i like the chunky tomatoes in mine. GREAT RECIPE DEFINITLY!

Hey, George, great recipe! Thanks. I only messed with it out of necessity and it still turned out great. (Didn't add the tomato juice cause I didn't have any...and threw in a can of black beans just because they were there!)
Used a yellow pepper since I didn't have green; also chopped in a carrot, which turned out to be a mistake!
Next time (which will be soon, based on wifey's applause) I'll try throwing in a dozen mushrooms and see what happens.
Thanks again, George. Fun recipe.

Wow! I am not usually a big chili fan, but this is GREAT chili. I think this would win awards. The only differences in my version were:

I used a food processor to chop the onion and the celery b/c my kids wont eat chunks of onions in anything. 

I omitted the green pepper only b/c I didnt have any.

I didnt realize Iw as low on chili pepper - I only had about 1/8 cup instead of 1/4 cup and was afraid this would ruin the chili, but it didnt. NExt time I'll use the whole 1/4 cup but really, 1/8 was fine!

Oh, and I used ground turkey b/c we dont eat a lot of red meat. 

GREAT chili. Thanks for posting!!!

I didn't have tomato juice on hand, so I replaced the sauce and juice with the equivalent amount of stewed tomatoes and their juice. My husband loves onions and cumin, so I nearly doubled both. I fried the onions in with the ground beef so they would be carmelized and yummy. Instead of plain red beans, I used 2 cans of chili-style beans with their sauce. I also replaced the white sugar with a sprinkling of brown. This all made for a rich, super-flavorful, stick-to-your-ribs chili that my husband and daughter really loved! Yum!

This has become a seasonal dish that my friends and family look forward to me making. I put sour cream, sharp cheddar cheese, and onions in side dishes for people to use as toppings.

It is extremely easy to make and very tasty! I forgot to buy the celery but it was still very good.

The only tip I have: if you use tomatoe paste and fresh/canned tomatoe instead of the juice the recipe called for (as I did), don't drain the beans. I found it a bit dry the first batch I made, the second batch I left the juice in and it was perfect.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

It was FABU. My friends went crazy over it. I did take another reviewer's advice and substitute canned diced tomato for the sauce and sauce for the juice though. I also used a can of black beans instead of one can of the kidney's and 1lb of ground tukey, 1lb ground sirloin and a tube of Jimmy Deans' hot sausage. I also used 3 large cloves of garlic, upped the cayenne, omitted the jalepeno, added 1/2 cup coffee and 1/2 cube baker's chocolate. It's my new favorite chili.

I can't BELIEVE how good this chili is -- but I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE how easy it is to make! I was shocked that you didn't even have to brown the onions and green peppers first. Really, really great chili. Very inexpensive to make, too. I'll never buy a mix again. Thanks so much for this WONDERFUL recipe.

Really good, hearty chili.  I replaced the tomato juice with tomato sauce and the tomato sauce with diced tomatoes.   I also cooked it in a slow cooker on high for about 4 or 5 hours and it came out great.

I have never made chili before and this recipe won first place at my friend's chili cookoff!  I took the advice of others and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice for a thicker chili.  I used pinto beans, red beans and light kidney beans for a variety.  I threw in some corn for color and left out the celery. The spice amounts were just perfect!!!  I used a little less chili powder, but some people complained it was not hot enough, so next time I will use the full amount. Thanks, it was a real crowd pleaser even with the children at the party!

I tweaked this recipe just slightly by adding more beans, cutting the chili powder & cumin both in half, and it was the best chili my husband & I have ever had!  I cut the recipe in half (5 servings), followed everything except I omitted the celery and added 2 cans (15oz) of  drained & rinsed beans (instead of the 1 cup suggested), used 1 TB chili powder and 1/2 tsp cumin - I kept all other spices at the recipe amounts suggested.  I mixed all of the spices in one bowl and then added the spice to the chili.  My husband is very picky about what he eats, but this was so tasty, wasn't "soupy" and we both loved it!  Will definitely make again.

I agree with the other reviewer that something was missing.  Ended up adding two beef boullion cubes to give it some body, and that helped quite a bit.

Recipe lacked something, so added more chili powder and splashed in some red wine - made it perfect! Leftovers lasted for over a week. I sprinkled some cheddar cheese over each serving, mmmm :)

I like this recipe a lot!  I've made it every week since the first time I've tried it, and I've gotten compliments from my family and coworkers.  The only changes I did were to add more celery and green pepper than what the recipe calls for and I also added about 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of 1/4 teaspoon.  I used kidney beans instead of red beans (it was what I had in the cupboard) and those worked well too.

This is amazing chili. I used pureed tomatoes in lieu of the tomato juice. I prefer to make the chili and reheat the next day slowly to let all the flavors come together. Awesome recipe!

True story-- I live in Texas, have several times made this chili totally vegan, entered it in "regular" ("carnivore") chili competitions, and taken home ribbons, including 1st place.  I used Boca crumbles once (browned in olive oil first to add that greasy chili component) and cheap TVP the next, so zero cholesterol or animal protein in it so we can avoid the diabetes and heart disease so common in our meat-obsessed society now.   Everywhere I take this, people rave, and nobody believes it's all vegan.  I wait till I got the ribbon before telling everyone there wasn't a spec of meat in it.  It's cooking up in the slow cooker right now, and I'm going to wow more people tomorrow at my new job.  I, like other users, also changed the tomato juice to tomato sauce, and the tomato sauce to diced tomatoes.  Other than that, and getting rid of the animal flesh for stuff that lets me eat till I almost burst without gaining an ounce, the recipe is perfect as is.

This is my first time making chili with a recipe.   Usually I cook and taste and add as I go.   I put my trust in the author and I wasn't disappointed.   The only place I didn't follow the recipe is with the green peppers.   I didn't have any to put in.  From past experience, I would have loved them in here.   I would probably compare this to a pretty good restaurant chili with some heat, but not a lot.   I've also never made chili before without some tomatoes in it.   I will probably use this again when I'm serving for those afraid of the tomato monster.

I hate when someone changes a recipe then pans it but I have made this a bunch of time, with a few changes,and my whole family loves it.  Tomato juice is not something I keep on hand so I use one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.  I also do one can of black beans and two cans of chili beans and a little finely diced jalapenos.  Really good chili recipe for a grandma who has never been able to make chili from scratch.

I thought I could make a mean chili, but thought I'd try this recipe.  This is by far the best chili!  It freezes beautifully, too.
I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and I would not change anything.  Going to make this for a crowd in the upcoming weeks and will share this recipe with them.  YUM!

I the followed directions. It turned out OK. Nothing really special. Good basic recipe. I was afraid that 1/4 cup of chili powder would be too much, but it actually wasn't too spicy.

Excellant!!!! Made this recipe pretty much accordingly. The only things I did differently was I used two red bell peppers and two small onions and omitted the celery. Everything else I kept the same. My boyfriend loved it!!! Will for sure make again!

Very good chili recipe! I added a small can of diced green chilies for a little heat.  I browned the ground beef and then made this in the crock pot (10 hours on low).

Excellent recipe as is, more or less. I like it hot so I add a little Tabasco or cayenne powder. I have tried it with diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, it makes it a little thicker but tastes about the same.

I make this a few times a month during the cooler months. If you try this, be warned that you probably won't ever make a different chili recipe ever again!

This recipe is spot on for my taste buds! I didn't change a thing and it is absolutely delicious! It is THE perfect chili for me- I like a little spice mixed with a little sweet and this is the perfect combo. If you like spicy you may want to add some jalapeno but for this girl, it takes the cake. This will be my award winning recipe from here on out. Thanks George this is exactly what I've been looking for!

Another recipe I've been making for years! Everyone loves it. I don't add cayenne because my kids don't approve and I use brown sugar instead of white. Super hearty and tasty! (And great on hot dogs!)

EXCELLENT. I MADE IT IN THE CROCKPOT. IT IS DELICIOUS. AFTER COOKING THE HAMBURGER IN A SKILLET, I DRAINED THE FAT AND PUT ALL THE DRY SPICES ON THE HAMBURGER. PUT ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS IN THE CROCKPOT WITH THE HAMBURGER AND COOKED ON HIGH FOR SIX HOURS.

This is my favorite chili recipe out of all the ones I have tried. I have made it as is but without the peppers and celery and it's amazing. I prefer it though with tomato sauce replacing the juice and 2 cans of the rotel tomatoes for chili. I also add 1 tsp of cayenne and it's perfect. I make mine in the crock pot. This is some award winning chili!

Made as recipe stated. While I'm not a chili fan, my family is so I made for them - all enjoyed - a "keeper"! I'm wondering if some simmered with cover on - that may have made it more soupy. With cover off it definately reduced. Hate to mess with a recipe if all enjoy but thinking about V8 versus regular tomato juice. Bought a package of cheddar-jack cheese for those who like to sprinkle and also had fresh scali bread! Thanks, George!!

I make this frequently but it calls for too much tomato juice. If you don't add more of the other ingredients then it will be soupy.

Great chili recipe, I can't add anything to make the original recipe better it is just right for our palate.  However, if you like really spicy chili, you might need to add additional cayenne, but apart from this-it's perfect!

This is a great chili...I made this a couple months ago, and froze half to have later.  I thawed in in the fridge overnight and it made a fantastic quick winter meal.  I like to top this with a pile of grated mild cheddar and some sour cream, and serve with some buttered rolls.  My husband is picky about his chili, and he enjoyed this.  It's nice and thick, heavy on the meat, and just enough kick for both of us.  Will definitely make again!

Love it but it’s a bit on the tart side.  I tone it down with an extra can of chili beans and a little more sugar.  Also think a half cup of bell pepper is weak for such a very large pot.  I use a cup.  Also great with broken tortilla chips and shredded cheese as toppings.

I have been making this chili for several years now and it is always a hit.  I am guilty of substituting a couple of ingredients though as recommended by a few posters.  I use tomato sauce in place of the juice and diced tomatoes in place of the sauce....everything else the same.  This is the best chili I have ever tasted!

This is the BEST chili that I have ever had! Just thick enough and just spicy enough! I like chunks of tomato in my chili though, so I added two cans of diced tomatoes, drained. If I feel like a less thick chili next time, then I will just added some of the liquid from the diced tomatoes.

This was an excellent chili.  It is was plenty spicy and I only used 1/2 of the chili powder (but, I'm a wimp).

Yes, this is it.  I have perfected many a chili recipe, but I still wondered.  Today, we were in the mood for chili and I searched for something new. This was a nice, rich, hearty but light recipe and proved to be a good base.  The tomatoe base's are nice (sauce and paste).  Only half the juice, and added a can of dice tomatoes with chili peppers, and chiptole or two.  Wow, very happy.  The taste was not extremely unique, but ecompased the great features of a basic+ chili recipe.  This is it for a "chili" recipe.

This is a very basic, but very good chili.  I mixed the dry spices together and put half of them in as I was afraid that it would be too spicy for us as written.  Cooked for a half hour or so, tasted chili and threw the other half in.  Just about perfect for us as written.  I did also added a small can of mild chopped chilis and I used half ground venison and half ground chuck.

AWESOME chili! I made as directed except: used 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb pork sausage. Substituted tomato sauce for tomato juice, and diced tomatoes for tomato sauce. I also used dried beans that I boiled separately and added at the end, because the texture is superior to canned beans. Everybody in the family loved this!

Wonderful recipe.  I did add a little cornstarch to thicken itup a bit and I used ground elk instead of beef.  Great flavor!

this is as close to perfect as a recipe could be.  here's what i did to change it:  i used tomato sauce instead of tomato juice; i used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce; and i used fresh garlic (6 cloves) instead of garlic powder.  i cooked it longer than the recipe recommends (more than 2 hours).  it was amazing.  absolutely great chili.  perfect really.

Made this the other night and my husband and son said it was the best.  Thought I would have leftovers for dinner the next night - my son ate most of it for lunch.  Added some pasta and made it work.  Fantastic Chili!

This is an absolutely amazing and delicious chili.  The only thing I didn't add was the celery because we didn't have any - other than that, it was made just as the recipe call for and it was incredibly wonderful.  We doubled the recipe because of the intense cold snap we've been having and it freezes wonderfully.  Thank you for submitting this George.  This is the only chili recipe that I will use from now on.  It just can't be beat.

Hubby asked for the canned "Hormel Chili w/out beans" to add to baked potatoes tonight.  Because I'm trying to cook more naturally, I searched allrecipes for a good homemade chili recipe instead.    I made this recipe without the beans and used can of chunky tomato sauce in place of juice (as others suggested).  I accidentally bought a "chili powder blend" instead of plain chili powder.   It has cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, red chili powder and more.  I found that even with all those flavors the chili was a bit bland.  I doubled the seasonings, added more salt and it was much better.  Hubby still likes the Hormel better, unfortunately, due to the lack of chunky veggies in Hormel.  I loved it and it tastes AWESOME on my baked potato.

This is a great basic chili.  I needed something that I could put together fast with what I pretty much had on hand and this fit the bill.  My kids liked it because it didn't have any chunky tomatoes.  The flavor was great and I didn't change a thing.

It was not bad, but nothing exceptional. For the amount of spices called for in the recipe, it was surprisingly on the bland side.

GREAT chili recipe! My guests ate it right up. I found it pretty mild for my taste, so as the chili simmered, I kept adding additional cayenne and tasting to get it to my preferred level of spiciness. I also might add in a can of tomatoes with jalapeños next time. Yum! This one is a real winner.

I've made this about 4 times and it's always great! Like the other commenters, I sub tomato sauce for juice and sub diced tomatoes for the sauce. I also use Louisiana hot sauce instead of chili powder.

Awesome chili! Be prepared though.. it really does make a lot. After I started adding the ingredients, I got nervous that it might not all fit in my pot. Gladly, it did, and now I have chili for a week. Like others, I added 1/4 cup of corn starch at the end, and it really thickened nicely. Definitely will make again.

Excellent, lighter chili! I like tomato pieces, so I used two (29 oz) cans of crushed tomatoes, two small cans of tomato sauce, and half of a beer instead of the tomato juice. I also used one pound of ground turkey, and half a pound each of ground sirloin and ground pork. Just what I was looking for...thanks so much!

This was excellent. It is different that the traditional chili you eat, and that is in a refreshing way. We had a bonfire party and it fed 35 people easily. We followed the recipe. We got compliments all night on it about how great it was. The best part it was so easy. We served it like frito pie with frito chips and corn bread.

This was VERY good chili. The only thing I would change is to add diced green chilis. I will definately be making this one again.

I personally do not like Chili.  I made this Chili for the first time today and used the recommended changes (paste for juice and diced tomatoes for sauce).  My husband loves this Chili!!  Thank you for sharing and thanks to all for the changes.   I will definitely use this again and again!

Amazing, awesome and phenominal!!! Thank you SOOOO much for this recipe. I have been craving chili for weeks and gave this a shot because I had all the ingredients on hand. I looove it, best chili EVER (my best friend makes a pretty good one, but this blows it out of the water!) and this was my first shot at chili so I am pretty proud of myself. I did sub sauce for juice and diced tomatos for the sauce...oh and used 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of kidney beans (we had last minute company so I needed to stretch the meal) but thanks so much, I will make this A LOT!

I love that this chili wasnt full of tomato!  It had awesome flavor, although it was on the mild side. Next Time I will probably only use half the juice, It did end up being a bit watery so I threw some rice in it and cooked it a bit longer.  Thank you for recipe!  My husband loved it!

This is a great chili recipe! It is a crowd pleaser across the board.  Easy, no wacky ingredients & not crazy spicy. My picky family put this away with no fights at the table!  Thank you for a great basic chili recipe, Mr Couch!

This had an excellent flavor and was super easy to make.  It is not the type of chili I am used to making though.  I like more beans and chunks of tomatoes in my chili.  Next time I will add chili beans and tomatoes to the pot and maybe try half beef half ground sausage.  the seasonings were perfectly portioned and gave this a great flavor and smelled soooo good!!  It was a little spicy for my kids to eat so maybe a little less cayenne next time.

I skipped the 1 can of tomato sauce and used just a little less than the whole can of tomato juice. Wasn't soupy at all. Just eye-ball it people!

This is a GREAT chili recipe!  I've made about a dozen different recipes, but this is my hands down favorite.  The combination of spices gives it a real smokey flavor. Didn't change a thing.  Hubby loved it!

Excellent recipe!  I made a few changes, based on what i had in the house.  Omitted the celery, used only one pound of ground beef, and made up for the loss by using 3 cups of pinto beans rather than red beans.  Fantastic!

Best chili I ever made!  I would personally add a little kick to it,  but the rest of the family loved it as is.  I just throw a little something extra in my bowl.  Awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent Chili!  Just like Grandma's!  I used V8 juice for the tomato juice and only half (2 tbs) of the chili powder (I figured guests could add Tobasco or whatever if they wanted it hotter) and it was perfect for me.  Yummy.  I served it with rice, but I forgot the cheese and no one missed it!

This is an excellent Chili, thick and tasty.  I used it as a base for Chili This year.  I make a Huge Batch in a Large Canning Pot and then freeze for days I am looking for a fast meal.  I used industrial crushed tomatoes, also added some corn and mushroom as well as Jalapeno peppers.  The chili used in your recipe is good as it is but I had a lot of seasoning to add.

Anyone who rates this a four is not believable, this is one of the best recipes on this site.  I did use crushed tomatoes instead of sauce.

I think this was the best chili I have ever made yet. I did not use the sugar and I added in a tablespoon of Hot sauce and tobasco because I did not have cayenne pepper. I also did not use the tomato juice or sauce. I use 1 can whole tomatoes and 2 cans diced tomatoes. That is what I always use instead. Love this recipe!!!

This chili is great!! I added a few things to it (a can of black beans, a larger amount of the seasonings, a can of sliced mushrooms, and towards the end, black olives) that we have to have in my house.....the chili is wonderful....but it will make a TON, so be prepared!! Wonderful, will make this again many times....but the red pepper does give it a little bit of a bite, so if you don't like hot stuff, maybe you'd want to leave it out.....

This turned out great. I didn't alter much in the recipe. Whole Foods didn't have specifically "tomato sauce" and "tomato juice" so I used puree and strained tomatoes respectively, but with the same effect I think. I also added a little fresh tomato. About the only other thing I did was cut back slightly on the chili powder and added a fresh jalapeno. Came out great. Maybe I'd reduce the ground beef and add more beans, but I'm fairly accustomed to vegetarian chili by now which is what I usually make, but I really wanted meat this time, and this was a good one. Simple too.

This was delicious.  I'm new to cooking, and it was still very easy to prepare.  I didn't think to look in the 'juice' aisle, so instead of the tomato juice, I added 42 oz of diced tomatoes and two cups of water, and it still turned out fantastically.

Followed the directions exactly (other than using red bell pepper instead of green).  My husband didn't care for the celery.  We'll leave that out next time.  This chili was good but not the most flavorful I've ever made.  I will make it again, however, because it is so easy and a great week night dish.  Made tons of leftovers too.  We will be freezing some.  Ate it with jalapeno corn bread as well as corn chips.

This really hits the spot for quick, easy, tasty chili!  I do think I'm going to tinker with it to find the exact flavor I'm looking for, however.

No need to change anything.  The spices are in perfect proportions.  A delicious, savory chili that tastes even better on day two--and three, if you don't devour it all before then!

Finally! A Chili recipe everyone in my family likes. I don't add the celery or bell pepper because my kids won't eat anything that I add those ingredients to. Great recipe...thanks for sharing!

A good recipe. I added more beans and made it vegetarian by using soy crumbles. I also threw in a bit more chili powder and some smoked paprika, to good effect.

I made a big pot of this for a gathering at my daughter's cheerleading school.  I did make the changes on the juice and sauce to sauce and diced tomatos because I wanted it a little thicker.  Turned out great and everyone enjoyed it.  I even doubled the recipe and didn't have any left overs.  Thanks for sharing it.  Amazing to see 26,000 people have saved this and over 1,000 ratings and STILL 4.5 stars!  Fantastic!

We love this chili - I've made it several times.  It's good with the tomato juice but I only use 1/2 the amount b/c it thins the chili too much and takes away from the flavor of the spices.  I often make it w/o the juice and substitute 2 cans diced tomatoes undrained.  I always add some diced tomatoes regardless and an extra can of beans (usually black).  We always freeze the leftover and it's just as good the 2nd time around!

I don't know why everyone who uses the tomato juice says its too soupy. I followed the directions to a T, and its so thick, it will not fall out of a slotted spoon. It tastes wonderful.   My husband absolutely loves it. He only gets chili during deer(or should I say beer)camp.I have never made it before. Very good recipe I will hand down to my own children. Love it!!!

Super easy and delicious! If it's too thin for you, replace the tomato juice with more tomato sauce. That worked for me. Also, next time I'll saute the onions and celery a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients. I halved the recipe because there's just two of us and it was ready just over an hour. YUM!

I have made this twice now and we love it! I  omitted the green pepper and decreased the chili powder to 1/8 cup.  Other than these minor changes, I followed recipe and it's excellent.

I have used this recipe a couple of times now, and both times were excellent.  I mainly use it for the spice combo, which is great.  In the past I used the chili seasoning packets, but have been trying cook healthier, with less sodium.  Instead of tomato juice and sauce, I use tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes.  I used to use sause and diced, but have found that the 'crushed with added puree' version provides a better texture. (Diced doesn't always cook down to the consistency I want.)  When possible, I make my soups on the stove, and let them simmer on low for several hours, then freeze any leftovers.  I found this recipe works excellent for freezing.  I save the little plastic trays from frozen entrees (eq. to one reg. size bowl), freeze chili, soup, etc, in them, then pop them out and store in foodsaver bags.  We call them chili pucks, or soup cicles, and they keep for months!

I have always used McCormick's chili seasoning to make my own chili, but, at my doctor's request, he wanted me to stop using those seasoning bags because they contain ingredients that aren't always good for you.  I decided to try this chili and I have to say, it's the best chili I have ever had!  Two thumbs up and a hip shimmy!!!

I made this last night and it is very good. I didn't have any bell pepper or kidney beans so I added black beans. I thought it was a little soupy so tonight I will make chili mac with the extra soupy. Also, it makes a lot of chili. I don't know why the person thought 1/2 tsp of sugar would make it sweet. It isn't and it has a good kick to it. I wouldn't want it any hotter. Can't wait to try it with the bell pepper and kidney beans.

My family really enjoyed this, the taste was very good and the consistency was nice. The recipe was also very easy to make and could be done pretty inexpensively for the amount of servings you are able to get from this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I followed another reviewers suggestion to add crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice, after cooking for an hour the chili became very thick, I like mine more soupy so I suppose I will just add more tomato sauce?  I also would've like to see more beans but still such a good recipe! Thanks so much! This will be my go to chili recipe!

As previous reviewers suggested, I made this with tomato sauce instead of tomato juice and diced tomatoes instead of the sauce.  I also used 1c chopped peppers.  Incredibly tasty!  Not too spicy, has a little kick though.

This a great chili, one I will certainly be making again. It got rave reviews and the kids ate it up. Per family tastes I added extra spices and used a orange pepper instead of a green. I didn't have celery but will add it next time. Thankyou for sharing this. :)

I have made this chili once a week now for the past three weeks. It is a very simple recipe and so delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and used tomato sauce to replace the tomato juice and diced tomatoes to replace the tomato sauce. It makes it a little thicker than the original recipe which I love. Definitely a keeper! :)

I made this recipe this morning in my crock pot.  I did modify slighty - rather than 46 oz of tomoato juice I used 1 1/2 cups of juice and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with oregano, onions and basil, and 3 cups of beans.  Other than that , I followed the recipe.  It is cooking as I type and smells amazing.  I did sample it and even though it is not completely cooked I already love it.    I am serving it with cornbread -also from this site.  Perfect recipe for a rainy fall Saturday! Will definitely make again.

Oh, My Gosh!!!  This is the first chili I have ever made (my husband is the chili maker in our family).  I made in 2/08 and my husband and I loved it.  This year when our family Chili Cookoff came around, I entered for the first time with this recipe.  And GUESS WHAT???  This is the very first year we had a Chili Queen instead of a King!!!  I won with this fantastic recipe!!!!  It is the BEST and I have the trophy to prove it!  : )  I made the recipe exactly as stated, with one exception~I left out the bell pepper.  Thanks soooo much for this recipe, George!  We all love it!

This is a great tasting chili con carne and terrific meal for football weather.  I took the advice of others and used a base of 28 oz diced tomatoes, 29 oz tomato sauce, and a 10 oz can of tomato soup.  I topped it with shredded cheddar and oyster crackers and served with a side of cole slaw.  I would prefer it a little thicker so next time I will remove the cover for 30 minutes or so while simmering.

How can you make chili & not add somethings that arent in the recipe? I added one 12 oz beer...I used Rolling Rock and added 2 T of Texas Petes Hot Sauce. Great recipe...I make this about 5-6 times a year & serve it over Brazillian Rice (recipe can be found on allrecipes)...thanks.

Great ingredients make a great recipe. The spice mixture is perfect and the next time I make it I will add two cans of diced tomatoes to sub for the juice. We like a thick chili so will cut back on the sauce/juice addition for our preference. I fried the beef in a skillet and then threw all in the crockpot to simmer for 3 hours on high. I also made with cooked up dry kidney beans. Lastly for more heat I threw in a whole hot pepper and pulled it out before serving. Thanks for the recipe! Oh yeah, I served w/ sourdough grilled cheese sandwiches. Yummy!

Not only easy, but delicious.  OK, now for the "slight" changes.  We enjoy a thicker chili, so instead of tomato juice, I substituted 2 14.5 oz. cans of stewed tomatoes.  Substituted 1 16 oz. can of tomato sauce and left everything else the same. Seasoning were just right.  Again, delicious AND hearty!!!

At last, a chili recipe that my entire family loves.  It is easy to make and comes out wonderfully every time.  My 5 year old son requests it regularly.  My husband is very particular about his chili and absolutely loves it!  Wouldn't change a thing!  We boil macaroni to serve with it so people can add it if they want it, but it is great just as is!

This was a good basic chili recipe, but we found it a bit boring.  We ended up adding more seasonings, garlic, and salt.  Maybe it had too much tomato flavor for my family.  We tend to like ours chunky and spicy.  Good recipe overall, but only with our own personal additions.

Ok the first day, MUCH better the next day.  I omitted the celery and bell pepper because of personal preference.  Also I only used dark and light red kidney beans 2 cans each.  And like some other reviewers suggested I used canned tomatoes versus the tomato juice.

Not only do we love this recipe but we have made it more than once.  Love it!!!  The only thing we did was to add a can of diced tomatoes.  We even tried this in the crock pot.  Not bad.  Better on the stove top.

Delicious!  My husband and I do not care for really spicy chili and this recipe had just the right amount of spice for us.  Using what I had in my pantry I had to make a couple changes.  I substituted one quart of home canned tomatoes for the tomato juice and used only one 15-oz. can of tomato sauce and one 15-oz. can of black beans (all I had).  My husband doesn’t like onions and peppers so I had to leave those out, however I did use onion powder.  I am sure they would have been delicious.  Even with the substitutions, the chili was wonderful!

I am sorry, but we did not like this. I will not make it again.   We thought it was very bland, not the least bit spicy.  If you are looking for a very mild chili this recipes is probably for you.  The only change I made is I had a little more then 2 lbs of grounds beef.  I gave it 3 stars because it was easy and those that are looking for a mild chili recipes may enjoy it.

THis is a good chili but I only gave it a four because there are a few things that need changing. First of all,it needs some more juice,I made it as is for lunch and decided quickly that it definatly needs some more juice,so for supper I added beef broth.I left out the celery (personal taste) and like some other reviewers suggested,I upped the cayenne pepper. All in all,a good chili to have.

This recipe was awesome.  We just finished eating.  The only thing I didn't have was tomato juice, so as others suggested I substituted two cans of diced tomatoes.  This is now my one and only chili recipe.

This chili was good and enjoyable but just did not have the taste like some other great chilis. I could only give this recipe 3 stars.  It had a nice simple taste. I followed the recipe to a tee.

good, basic chili.  just the right amount of spice for me (too much for my kids though of course).  i would add another 1/2 lb. beef or maybe some sausage to mix it up.
thanks.

Very good chili recipe - plenty of flavor, and just the right amount of "heat" for my taste.  I followed the recipe closely (I did cook the chopped onion and pepper up with the ground beef), and the chili turned out great.  I'll definitely try this one again.

I have made chile from this site and this one, in my opinion, is the best one so far...Very easy to make. Even my husband said it was better than the others...It taste even better the next day! Followed the recipe to a "T". It wasn't too spicy so for my personal taste I added pickled jalepeño peppers and yummy very delicious..!!!! Definetly great!!!

This is a keeper......it's a real good, basic chili recipe that you could enjoy as it is, or build on.  I personally, would put half the amount of tomato juice, because it is a bit soup, or perhaps next time, I might just add more kidney beans....as far as seasoning, it would be considered a more mild chili, which would be perfect for those with young children.  I did add a bit more cayenne for a little more spice.

Doubled recipe for an event, have never chili w/ celery in it as far as I know.  Had lots of requests for mild chili & gave this one a go.  Glad I did, easy & flavorful w/o being bland.  Had toppings on the side, cheese, onions, s/c, jalapenos, corn chips.  this will  become my "go to " recipe fm now on!

I didn't have tomato juice, so I substituted V8 vegetable cocktail instead. I was a bit worried just looking at it in the pot,becasue I thought it would be too thin or that it would not come out right; but it was absolutely tasty! I served it with savoury muffins, and an array of fresh chopped cilantro, minced green onions, sour cream, & shredded cheddar cheese.  The cilantro really brought out the flavours,and this is definitely a keeper for our home. it was a big hit. Thanks for a great recipe

Great recipe! This is one that will be my staple chili recipe. The only changes I made was I omitted green pepper and celery and used diced tomatoes in its own juice instead of tomato juice. I cooked it for Halloween last night and got rave reviews! I even had the recipe requested!

Really good! We made it as written, and may fiddle with it another time for variety.  
Topped with small Fritos and chopped onion and shredded cheddar.

AMAZING!  You can really play around with the tomato base.  I used what I had -  a big can of paste, a 29 oz can of sauce and 1 15 oz can of diced.  Really good!  My husband requested it for his birthday so I served it in bread bowls with all the fixings.  Cheddar cheese, sour cream, diced red onions, cilantro and pickled jalapenos!

I thought that the while the flavor was good, the juices far exceeded the ratio of meet/bean and juice.

I can't even believe how good this chili is! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. It isn't even done cooking, but I already know. My husband couldn't wait for it to finish before he got himself a bowl. I tried to get him to wait, but he wouldn't. He LOVES chili and he says this is just perfect! I left out the bell peppers and celery just according to our own taste and added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper because we like things spicy. I took another reviewers advice and added a little less than 1/4 c. of corn meal. This is so good I know I will be cooking this frequently and I'm glad because I can't wait to eat a lot of this! It was my first time making chili from scratch and I'm so glad it came out well. It is fast, easy and affordable! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!

I am a pretty good cook but have NEVER been able to make a good chili.  This is the one, I will quit trying any other.  I did switch the juice for one and half big cans of sauce and I did add one 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes but I kept the seasoning exactly the same and it was PERFECT.  Will definately make again.

This is a very good basic chili recipe. I doubled the batch and sent it with my son to college for dinner on moving in day. I was told that everyone liked it. My suggestion is to try it according to the recipe and then take it from there, as everyone it seems has there own opinion regarding how chili should taste. This recipe is darn tasty, but not so much as to offend the more delicate palates among us. I added a pan of cornbread with jalapenos for those who needed more heat.

fantastic. I had to make a few changes but nothing major. I like a thicker chili so instead of tomato juice I used a large can of crushed tomatoes, a 15 ounce can of stewed tomatoes, a little can of tomato sauce and a 15 oz can of tomato paste. I also used 3 different kinds of beans. I used the same spices except I didn't have any cayenne so I used habanero sauce instead. We like things hot so I threw in some diced jalapenos too. To give a little more flavor to the meat itself I browned it with some of the onion and a clove of minced garlic. Great recipe. I don't think I changed things that really impact the recipe itself except the hotness. It's a good combination of spices. good flavor.

This chili is the best I've ever made or eaten! I used all the ingredients except I also added a can of Rotel and two cloves of minced garlic.  After browning the meat, I cooked the onion, green pepper, and celery together until they were crisp tender and then followed the rest of the directions.  I think my stomach is going to explode from gobbling up all of this delectable chili!

I swear this is the best chili I've ever had...and I too would give it more than 5 stars if the option was there.  The ground beef gets so tender that it almost melts...the spices are mild, which is different than what I am used to but it works perfectly.  The only thing I do different is add half the tomato juice at once, then slowly add the rest as it cooks down.  (I occassionally add a can of diced tomatoes and extra beans.)

Great recipe and I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nice Yankee chili.  As a side note, I'd like to respond to those who criticize others here for putting their own twists on submitted recipes.  I just don't understand why some think its a sin not to follow a recipe "exactly".  I think any recipe on here should be experimented with.  I for one, LOVE that others have tried different ingredients, cooking methods or whatever.. it gives me great ideas and helps me to be more creative when I cook.  There are few professional chef's here and I think any recipe posted to a public forum is open to new ideas and fun surprises.  I have a recipe posted here and nothing gives me more pleasure than to see people giving it a try - changing up the methods, adjusting the baking time, adding sesame seeds to the top.. whatever.  I find it exciting and extremely flattering that they would try my recipe in the first place.  If they change half the ingredients and the recipe fails, then I suspect people in here are intelligent enough to figure out the source of the failure.  There is only one ingredient substitution that drives me nuts.. diet or low cal mayonnaise for regular mayonnaise!  Maybe in some recipes it works fine, but for my mom's potato salad recipe - nothing but real mayo would work.  I say, if you have to substitute for low cal mayo, maybe you should take only half, then put your fork down!  I say, have fun!

Excellent Chili.  I made a few adjustments to better accomodate my boyfriend and I's taste, but I bet its awesome as is.  I used 1 can black beans and 1 can kidney beans, drained.  Ommitted the cumin, because I don't have any and added a chopped fresh red chili pepper and used groud turkey instead of beef. Instead of tomato sauce I used 1 can of whole stewed tomatos- diced with juice.  EXCELLENT

DELICIOUS!!! By far the best chili I have ever made. I removed the casings and added spicy turkey sausage to it for a little extra spice and i substituted the ground beef with ground turkey. I made the rest of the recipe as is and it was a huge hit! Excellent recipe!

This was wonderful! Everything came out tender and flavorful with a pleasing consistency. It wasn't too thick and it wasn't watery either. Next time I would make a little less though. It seemed like more than ten servings once it was done.

I was so disappointed in this recipe given the ratings. I honestly do not understand the high ratings.  Only with the addition of several spices, cheese, sour cream, and crackers was I able to salvage something remotely tasty for dinner.

I made this recipe for my son's end of year class party which was a Mexican theme. After reading some of the reviews, the only thing I did different was add an extra lb of ground beef (I wanted to stretch it for the whole classroom). Since some of the reviews said there was a lot of liquid, I figured an extra lb wouldn't make too much of a difference. I too am one of those people who can't understand how people change the whole recipe by adding and substituting different flavors and then give it a bad rating.  Well, I think this recipe is awesome just the way it is. It came out great! This will be the recipe I use for chili from now on. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best chili recipe I have ever tasted, and probably my most requested! Perfect blend of spices - great flavor!  I like my chili really thick, so I add a can of tomatoe paste, and 3 cans of beans (kidney and red beans).

This is a really great recipe.  I've made it a few times substituting ground turkey or vegetarian crumbles for ground beef.  I usually kick up the heat a little by adding chopped green serrano chili.  I also add just a drop of vinegar for a little tang.  This is a keeper.

This was terrible.  The tomato juice and tomato sauce turned this into tomato soup with a kick.  I was looking for a hearty superbowl chili, and this definitely wasn't it.  I will not make this again.

I made this on Super Bowl Sunday. I browned the hamburger and put all the ingredients together in the crock pot and let it cook all day. It was the best chili we have ever had and will be the only chili we make in our house. Thank you for the recipe.

This was excellent!  I used V8 for the tomato juice, petite diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce, and omitted the salt.  I used a whole red bell pepper instead of a green pepper, added a chopped and seeded jalepeno, and added two full cans of beans.  This chili was not too spicy at all but if you like your chili really spicy, adding tabasco sauce is really yummy!

Looking at the ingredients you’d never guess this makes good chili. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that it is a bit “soupy.” I found it got thicker with each reheat. I made this for guests so instead of the ground beef I used two pounds of sirloin which I cubed and braised. If you like super chunky chili, I think you could easily double the non-liquid ingredients. But, I would make it just “as is” the first time.

Great tasting chili.  Did everything as recipe said with the exception of celery since I didn't have any on hand.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very good chili.  Following others' suggestions, I used three 15 oz. cans of diced (petite) tomatoes and a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce.  Didn't have any celery, but I know from past recipes that would have made it even better.  Middle-of-the-road as far as spicy goes, which is perfect for us.  The husband can always add tabasco sauce!

I think this is the best chili recipe on this site. I made as directed the first time, and the second time I opted to add garlic, diced tomatoes, and beef stew meat. I didn't need all of the tomato juice, and substituted some of the juice with beer. Put in a slow cooker on low for 4 hours to let flavors mix, and you have one heck of a chili!!  YUM!!!

Really good and spicy! I used 32 ounces of V8 juice, one 15 ounce can of tomato sauce and one 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes. My husband doesnt like bell pepper so I omitted that and the celery and added one whole jalapeno diced and red pepper flakes. Also salted my hamburger meat with garlic salt as I was browning it. Even better topped with sour cream and cheese!

Fantastic! I made this for 20 servings. It called for 2 cans of tomato sauce, the only change I made was to use 1 can tomato sauce and 2 cans of rotel tomatoes. I brought it to a boil, turned down heat to a med boil for about 45 min., put it in a crock pot and simmered on low for about 6 hours. I made this 3 times over Thanksgiving week for 3 different groups of people. My husband can not stand chili and he even enjoyed it. I think it is even better the next day.

This is a fantastic recipe. I'd never made chili before, and my fiance is a Texan, so this was serious business. He loved it. We both like a meaty, thick chili though, so I did change the fluids a bit. I use a 29oz. can of tomato sauce and a 14.5oz can of crushed or diced tomatos on lieu of the suggested sauce/juice amounts. We top it off with cheddar and sour cream. YUM.

Whoaaa! I was expecting a good chili. I got a GREAT chili! This is some of the best chili I have ever experienced. I have tried so many different recipes, including one on this site that has high reviews and twice as many ingredients and it doesn't come close to this. This chili has the perfect blend of spices and ingredients, and so simple to prepare. Thank you to the recipe submitter for ending a long search for a great chili!

An A-1 beef and red beans chili...especially if you substitute tomato sauce for the juice, and diced tomatoes for the sauce. Anyone can kick up the heat to their individual tastes.  It is now my go-to chili recipe!

This was a really good, really simple chilli. The only things I did differently were add a bit of red wine to simmer it in, and served with baked potatoes topped with cheese and sour cream. Superb. Would definitely make it again as cuts down on messing about that seems to go with making a lot of of chillis and can adapt the strength by adding hot or mild chilli powder.

I'll admit - I'll usually use chili seasoning packets.  My mom is gluten intolerant and most packets contain gluten so I had to go from scratch.  This recipe was INCREDIBLE.  I will never again use a packet!  I made a couple of substitutions as recommended by other reviewers:   2 cans diced tomatos instead of tomato sauce and tomato sauce instead of tomato juice.  Even my very-picky 7-year-old liked it!  Thank you for the wonderful, wonderful recipe!

I have made this chili two times now and it has been a huge sucess each time.  It is hard to find a chili with a seasoned taste and this one truly has.  It tastes just as good warmed up later.

I doubled this recipe for a chili cook-off and won hands-down. Since I was doubling it, and I like really meaty chilis, I added some hot pork sausage to the mix, but I kept everything else the same--the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  Truly fabulous!

George, George, George.  What can I say?  You're the chili master!  I burned my tongue a couple of times "tasting" the chili, couldn't help myself.  I used 1/2 the tomato juice, and 1 large can of diced tomatoes.  Other than that I left everything exactly as stated in the recipe.  Served with shredded cheese, sour cream and green onions.  EXCELLENT,
Everyone loved it!

Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with the WWW.

Highly Recommended!   Very delicious.  The only thing I did differently is that I used Ground Turkey instead of Ground Beef and it was very yummy.  Different than our basic chili recipe and I will definitely be making again in the near future!  Thank you!

Another Blue Ribbon for this chili!  It was the best at our chili cookoff at work today.  I made some slight changes suggested by others and it was easy as well as yummy.  I used tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and 2 cans of chili beans.  I drained one and left the sauce in the other.  I knew the taste of chili beans was what I was looking for rather than just red beans.  I also halved and seeded a jalapeno pepper and tossed it in instead of the cayenne pepper.  Perfect!!

I made a few modifications to this recipe with fantastic results! I used 1/2 italian sausage, 1/2 ground beef & added a pound of bacon & a can of jalapeno peppers.  It had just the right amount of zip without being overpowering or too tomatoey.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe gets 5 stars not only for its taste, but for its ease of preparation.  This was the first time I had ever made chili and I know now that I will be making it often.  The spices were great.  I made only a few changes.  Instead of garlic powder, I used about 8-10 gloves of fresh garlic (I follow the philosophy that one can never have too much garlic).  After I browned the meat (I used 96% lean), I removed it and then sauted the onions, celery, green pepper, and lastly the garlic with a little bit of olive oil in the same pot.  I simmer the meat for about 30 minutes before adding the beans because I didn't want the beans to fall apart.  I used two cans of dark red kidney beans and one can of black beans and for me the ratio of beans to meat was perfect.  I served the chili with fresh baked corn bread.  I can't wait to eat the leftoevers tomorrow!

Very Yummy. It is not spicy at all so if you like heat you might need to add some extra ingrediants. But the flavor is great!! Oh I used tomatoe sauce and diced tomatoes also.

I'll give this 4 stars.  I use a 29 ounce can of tomato puree instead of sauce.  This will make the chili much thicker, I've been using this recipe for years and it is very good.

I thought it was really good, I made it with Turkey instead of Beef just for a leaner chili.  I did however feel that it wasn't thick enough, and I added another can of beans.  I thought it tasted good, but it didn't blow me away.  Maybe next time add crushed tomatoes, or diced to eliminate some liquid.

This took me a little while to prepare and I didn't win the chili cookoff!!!  It is NOT a hot chili (not that it claims to be) and it is a lot runnier than I like.

Excellent recipe! Easy to make and very delicious. It's much better than any canned chili you'd find and probably at a fraction of the cost (although I haven't done the math).

I prepared this chili exactly to the letter and the only thing I'll do differently next time is add a bit more beef and/or beans. Me likey a very thick chili. ;)

Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

This was a great recipe for chili! I did; however, make a few adjustment to satisfy my own tastes and what I had in the cupboard. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and instead of using tomato juice I used a full can of tomato sauce and a full can of diced tomatoes. Delicious!

This was very good and super easy!  I did saute the onions and peppers before adding.  I cooked this in my crockpot, too.  I did reduce the chili powder to 2 T. and only used the tomato sauce as my hubby doesn't like tomato chunks.  He enjoyed it, and he's very picky about chili.  Thanks!

Had a nice to it. My kids and husband loved it. No more chili seasoning packets for me! The only thing I did different was add a can of diced tomatoes it added a nice texture to it, we love tomatoes cooked in with things. Will make this one everytime we want chili. Thanks for sharing this one.

I made this chili recipe for a chili cook off and I won runner up to first place.  The only thing I changed was making it out of ground turkey instead of beef.  The spices really make the difference.

We cut the chili powder down to 2 tsps from 1/4 cup for the more tender tummies in the house. Omitted the green pepper due to preference. Also added 1 can of white beans. It had enough kick for the tougher but still a wee bit too much for the lighter-weight. Overall very tasty! I added soft cheese to mine - others used crackers and bread - we all had two bowls! These Wisconsin flatlanders will make it again! Thanks!

This chili was delicious! I had to change a few things because of some ingredients I didn’t have (didn’t have cayenne pepper so I used crushed red, use diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice, etc), but it tasted great! Want to try it again without the changes next time :).

Well rounded easy chili recipe. We were out of town recently and I needed to make a chili for a chili party. I had most of the ingredients on hand at our vacation home, so I decided to go with this recipe. I followed the recipe with only 2 changes. I used low sodium V8 in place of the regular tomato juice and accidentally forgot to purchase celery, which I will add next time b/c I like the flavor cooked celery brings to other dishes I make. I sautéed the onion and bell pepper before adding all ingredients together. I was fortunate I had the time to make a day ahead and agree that it is better the second day, as most dishes of this type tend to be as the flavors have more time to meld together.  Good solid recipe!

If I hadn't listened to the comments it definitely would've been soupy, so 4 stars for the recipe as written but  BEST CHILI EVER with the simple changes. If you like soupy and don't like tomato bits, follow as written! If you like it hearty, try this: I subbed the tomato juice for tomato sauce and tomato sauce/bell pepper for 3 10oz cans of Rotel (diced tomatoes w/ green chilis). I also drained Everything and rinsed the beans, and the chili came out perfectly thick and hearty with no need to add corn meal. This is my first time making chili and I nailed it, so it has to be easy- I'm so glad I didn't go with the more complicated recipe on this site.  And last tidbit, I precisely halved this recipe and it was the perfect amount (about 4 big bowls) for a couple with leftovers or small family with none. Hope this helps!

As others recommended, I substituted tomato sauce for the tomato juice (46 oz) and diced tomatoes for the 29 oz of tomato sauce.  The beans I used were one can each kidney and pinto.  After browning the meat, I put it along with all remaining ingredients in a crock pot and cooked on low for about 7 hours.  That was for my convenience, as I was going to be gone for that length of time.  My husband and I ate it twice, topped with sour cream, grated cheddar and sliced green onions.  I froze the remainder which will easily provide another 2+ meals for us.   We both liked this a lot!

Just made it this morning. Made exactly as is but instead of  using the stovetop I put it in the crockpot on high for 4 hours. I put it in a competition this afternoon and won! I got 1st place in the "Mild" category and won Overall Chili Cookoff Champion! I don't think I'll be making any changes to the recipe!!

I made it twice so far. Very good and tasty. I did make a change the second time and gave it better flavor. The change was:

Substituted the 46 oz of tomato juice with 23 oz of V8 vegetable juice and 23 oz of V8 Red Radiance Fruit juice.

Try it! I am sure you will enjoy it!

It has never occurred to me to add cumin and oregano to chili, great idea!  I did use diced tomatoes and a bean mix.  I let the meat, onion, spices and tomato simmer for awhile then add the other veggies and beans in the last half hour.  Also sautéed 2 cups of mushroom and added with the veggies. I'm not sure what chili powder in the states is like, but here in Australia if you added 1/4o cup it would be inedible..!season to taste :)

I just won a chili cook-off with this recipe! I followed it pretty close. I added 1/4 cup corn meal and diced 2 anaheim peppers, but otherwise it was the original recipe using ground venison for the burger. Very pleased! :)

Just a tad less chili powder (our preference). The rest was awesome as is.

delicious chili. I left out the cayenne pepper because it's too spicy for me otherwise followed to the letter. my mother's chili is similar except she uses brown sugar instead of white.

I made two batches, one as is, and one minus the sugar and meat and added black beans, I did add garlic and used less tomato juice (not sure exact amount?) just because we like it a little thick. I also cooked in the slow cooker for convenience. Everyone loved this!

Really like this recipe.  I've grown up making chili and I always cooked the onions, celery and bell pepper until it was tender before adding the rest.  In the fall it's fun to roast a hatch pepper and peel it and dump it into the chili.  It doesn't increase the heat that much.  I also experiment with different chili powders.  We really like chipotle chile flavor.  I love club crackers in my chili and my husband says no way.  Well we both can eat chili for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Great recipe.  We always have cornbread with lots of honey with our chili.  Thanks.

We've made this several times for ourselves and company.  It's a hit every time.  The only change we make is we sub in sauce for the juice and diced for the sauce.  It's good after 1.5 hours but even better when it cooks longer.

Loved this. Used sauce instead of juice and rotel instead of tomato sauce. Did 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. turkey sausage. I also doubled the beans.  This will be my go to chili recipe. Thanks!

This hit the spot on a cold, rainy October night.  The one change I made was with the beans.  I used hot chili beans rather than red beans.  We are not big fans of red beans, so for us, this was the perfect switch.  This chili is even better the second day as the flavors had time to meld after being heated once.  Served this with 'Jalapeño Popper Wontons' from AR.

This chili is delicious. It's so simple but packs so much flavor into every bite! I made it exactly as the recipe says with the exception of doubling the cayenne because I like it hot. It's definitely my new go-to chili recipe and has been hand written onto a card in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing!!

This was delicious! I added a couple of cups of frozen corn and a can of diced tomatoes (because I like the texture) also I added a bit of red peppers with the green and a can of black beans in substitution of the second can of red. Sooo good! I served it with quinoa, corn bread (with some agave on top, adds a touch of sweetness), shredded cheese and sour cream. Mixed it all together and it was incredibly delicious and hearty!!! We all loved it!

Followed this recipe exactly except for one, sorta big, exception. Instead of ground beef I used beef tongue. I'm sure that sounds off-putting to a lot of people but we love beef tongue in this house. This made a very flavorful mild chili. Next time, will make some changes to heat it up a bit. Very good base to work from.

Have made this several times and it's always delicious and easy.  We do substitute 2 29-oz cans of stewed tomatoes (that we chop up) instead of the tomato juice, so there are chunks of tomato in the chili.  That also makes it a bit thicker.

I tried this recipe and it was very good. I did have to substitute and omit some of the ingredients because of a lack of supply at home though. i was unable to put the celery and green pepper in and instead of the tomato juice and tomato sauce I used a can of diced tomatoes and a tomato paste mixed with about a cup and 1/2 of water. I also added 2 fresh garlic cloves to the recipe. I don't know if you can call it the same recipe, but it did turn out great!

Terrific!  My husband and son raved about the flavor!  I prepared the recipe as directed, using a little less chili powder (personal preference) and added a packet of chili seasoning while it simmered.  It's not only going into the dinner rotation, but with a little prior prep, it's perfect to make on camping trips.  5-star winner!

Made it almost exactly as follows, the only thing I left out was the cayenne and just added a 1/4 tsp of more chili powder instead. Turned out awesome, and not too watery like other reviews stated, just let it sit for 10min after removing from burner to thicken and you're good to go.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years. My family really likes it. I did make a few changes to it. I put in a red pepper, I use only 1 can of beans,I don't put in the whole can of tomato juice, and I completely omit the tomato sauce. The sauce makes it to tomatoey. I really like how there is not a chili seasoning mix packet used, with the use of the seasonings it makes it more flavorful. I do add tomatoes once in awhile. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my go-to chili recipe. I make it all the time! The only change I make is adding more cumin. When I don't have tomato juice on hand, I'll use canned diced tomatoes instead. It's great either way.

Quite possibly the greatest chili recipe of all time! I normally substitute a can of stewed or diced tomatoes for an equal amount of tomato juice. Everyone always gets seconds.

I've tried several chili recipes, and this is the one for me. It is not too spicy (though you can make it as spicy as you want to) and had just a good general overall flavor and texture.  Worked perfectly for making frito pies with my kids, who can't handle the heat yet.

I won a chili cook off with this recipe! I followed the suggestions and used spaghetti sauce and italian sausage. It didn't take long at all to throw it all together. Let it sit in the fridge overnight and serve the next day. It seems to be tastier the next day.  This is by far the best chili I have ever tasted! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I give it 10 stars!!!! I follow the recipe as is and we love it. Super simple recipe. I always make a double or triple batch and then freeze it in smaller servings and take out for topping on baked potatoes or chili cheese fries. So YUMMY

*cut the recipe down for a smaller family and changed the servings to 5*

the spices make this chili taste the way it does and I followed them exactly. DELICIOUS. perfect straight forward chili recipe.

What I love most is that you just throw it all in the pot, stir and cook. Only need to brown the meat separately and you can do that while you're prepping everything else.

I added some frozen corn to mine, omitted the bell pepper b/c I didn't have any on hand, added a full  medium sized onion, used 2 14-oz cans tomato sauce & 1 lg can crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. Threw maybe a cup of water to add some liquid. Used a large can of red kidney beans. 

I changed things but nothing about the spices and that's what I think makes it what it is.

I cook this recipe in the Crock Pot on low about 4 hours.  It's a family favorite!  I omit the cayenne as it's too hot for the kids, and reduce the tomato juice by about half because we like it a bit thicker.

LOVE this recipe! I was a little skeptical at first because of the amount of tomato juice and sauce it called for, but it's become my go-to chili recipe.  The only changes I make are adding a little extra cumin and cayenne pepper to better suit my taste, but otherwise I follow instructions as-is and it turns out great every time (I've left out the green pepper and celery once before too because I didn't have them on hand; it was just as good without). I always receive rave reviews and requests for the recipe when I make this. Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe!

This is a very basic chili recipe.  Very good, especially on a cold day.  I followed the recipe as far as ingredients were concerned, but threw it in my crock pot after cooking and draining the ground beef.  Everyone had seconds.

Reliable recipe and worthy of being in your repertoire. Knowing ahead of time that I don't like Kidney beans, I substitute Pintos. Chili without beans is often called "Texas" chili... a misnomer because Texans like beans the way Mungo likes beans. Don't skimp on the chili powder. No, no! But do use a premium chili powder. Your chili dish will never be any better than the chili spices used in it. Morton's Chili Blend, if you can find it, or Schilling. Gephardt's if that's all you can find. And taste it before you decide on the cumin... some chili blends already have cumin in them. Good chili isn't necessarily hot; it is, however, well spiced and flavorful. I'm more inclined toward crushed tomatoes or tomato puree, but out on the cattle drives where chili was invented (to use up less than prime beef scraps) they probably didn't tomatoes at all. It's a very personal dish, but some chuck-wagon cooks were buried beside the trail just because of their chili.

This was a fantastic recipe. I thought it was the perfect amount of spicy, but you can always add more if you like it that way. Perfect for a cold day!

Best chili recipe EVER. Great flavor, love the vegetable juice. I added just a smidge more salt and added all the spices to the meat and beans before the liquid so everything would be coated. I will make this again and again.

This is simmering right now and I have already eaten 1/2 cup before it finishes cooking.  Great flavor. Subbed more tomato sauce for the juice, and in lieu of the beans added a bit more onion, bell pepper, and a small can of chopped jalapenos. Super chili; super easy!

Excellent recipe. Perfect amount of spices. We do not like very spicy food so was perfect for us. I imagine if you want it spicier you could add more.  I used 1 lb hamb and 1 lb. ground pork. Didn't have tomato juice, so I used 28 oz dices tomatoes and 1 - 28 oz tomato sauce and 1  -28 oz crushed tomato. I think anything you have on hand will work. Served with French Bread recipe by Jenn Hall from this site. Delicious!!

We LOVE this recipe.  Sometimes when I make it, I will use SPICY V8 juice in place of tomato juice.  I also like to use a LOT of beans.  2 cans of red, 2 cans of black and 2 cans of white.  It is very pretty and delicious.  The seasonings are perfect.

I made this chili one night for dinner, I made twice the amount so my family would have extras, and I used 2 lbs of ground beef and 2 lbs of ground pork and everyone loved it! I also, instead of tomato sauce and tomato juice, I just used kroger brand diced tomatoes chili ready, and they added beautiful texture to the chili as well as made it meatier. Everyone loved the recipe, including a couple people who really dislike chili. Definitely making this recipe again!

I loved this chili recipe! I followed it almost entirely except I omitted the celery (not a fan) and I slow cooked it on low for a few hours in my dutch oven so the flavors would have time to marry. I also did what other reviewers suggested and added cornmeal. It took the chili from wonderful to amazing! I like spicy so I also added more cayenne pepper until it was spicy enough for me.  I served it with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread (also on this site). Thanks for posting!

I didn't have the green pepper to add, and used a combo of canned diced tomatoes and tomato sauce instead of the juice, and used home-cooked black and red beans with some of the juice.  This is great recipe; will be my go-to recipe from now on!!

This is a great recipe! However, I changed a a few things to my liking. I added 1 tsp. more of cumin, 3 tablespoons of sugar to the sauce (this cuts down the tomato acid a bit), and an extra tsp. of salt. Next time, I believe I'll add 1/2 tsp. to each lb. of the beef before cooking.

Good thick chili.  I used 1 cup of celery (instead of 1/2) and 2 cans of red beans (instead of 2 cups).  SO GOOD!  Perfect with some macaroni for ChiliMac!

I really enjoyed this recipe! Thank you for sharing.
I took some liberties with some of the ingredients. I exchanged 1lb of beef for sausage, added about a cup more of celery, and tossed in double cayenne pepper.
I also added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, a can of diced green chilis, and 2 garlic cloves.
The tomato juice really boosted the flavor of this chili! I made sure to use the kind that isn't from concentrate.

This was good.  Next time I would leave some liquid out so that it is a little thicker.  I also used chili beans instead of red beans, but that's just a personal preference.

This recipe is wonderful. I've made it without the ground beef and as written. Both are excellent. I depend on my slow cooker for stews and soups andd this was no exception. I cooked the ground beef, drained it, and put everything in the Crock-pot. By dinner time, I just had to make some cornbread and the family was loving it! Just to add variety, I make elbow macaroni for chili mac and the kids always ask for more! Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I have never made chili from scratch before and this recipe, as is, needs nothing.  Excellent flavor.  Spicy enough to clear your nose but not hot enough to make you sweaty.  My husband said he would have preferred it to be thicker as it does have a little bit of a sauce-like texture to it.  However, I really loved that about it.  Even my 1.5 year-old happily ate this!

This chili rocks! okay...like many others, I use this recipe as a base. I substitute ground turkey for beef, tomato sauce for juice, diced tomatoes for sauce, anaheim chiles for bell peppers (for a bit more spice). I also use 3 cans of three beans instead of 2 cans red beans. I put it all together in a large frying pan then throw it in a crock pot on low for at least 6 hours. It is so delicious. We made it for a party last night and people were raving about it I just finished the last bowl for lunch and looking forward to when we'll have it again. Make it along with a pan of cornbread and you've hit a home run!!! Thank you George Couch. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!

My new favorite chili! Made this chili as is and thickened it a little. Spooned it on top of cooked spaghetti noodles, topped with cheese and served with pickles on the side. It was delicious. Made enough to freeze and use throughout the week -- frito chili pie, chili and on our hot dogs.

Very heavy on the tomato, this one.  I added more beans and some beef broth to try to bring down the over-the-top tomato taste, and it helped.  Will be looking for another recipe.

Even though I’ve been making my mother-in-law’s chili recipe for years, I tried this recipe because it was recommended by another cook on the buzz.  I slightly tweaked this recipe such as adjusting the seasoning, and adding molasses instead of the sugar which I feel rounds out the flavor.   I prefer chili to have more red kidney beans and would add more the next time.  However, having said that, this recipe is delicious I’m sure without any changes and is easy to adjust to suit your taste.  I'll be making this again.

This chili is delicious! Two pounds of beef seemed like a bit too much though,  so we only used one pound of beef, with an extra can of kidney beans and one can of black beans to make up for it. We also added one small can of chopped jalapeno peppers for extra heat, and took other reviewer's advice for adding 1/2 cup cornmeal. Awesome chili! Served it with whole wheat corn bread.

This is now my "go to" chili recipe. It makes a great tasting base and you can easily adjust the heat by increasing or decreasing the cayenne. My family likes it with Cheddar Cheese goldfish crackers and I put a dollop of sour cream on mine. Great recipe!

This was very good chili.  I am not usually a fan of chili, so I only served myself a small bowl and I ended up going back for seconds.  My husband is a huge fan of chili and he had thirds.  After reading the reviews, I subbed 1 qt tomato sauce, 1 pt juice + @2Tbsp tomato paste, and 1 pt diced tomatoes for the juice and sauce called for in the recipe.  That worked out really well for us, but next time I will probably just do 1 qt sauce and 1 qt diced tomatoes.  I also omitted the black pepper since my son is allergic and I bumped up the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp to account for the missing black pepper.  And I did use 2 full cans of drained and rinsed red beans, rather than just 2 cups.  We served this over noodles like in the picture.  Very tasty, thanks!

What a fantastic recipe!  I made a few modifications based on other reviews, but the base recipe is a keeper in my household.  I added two seeded serrano peppers, a bag of frozen okra, 1 tbsp cayenne, 1lb of spicy italian sausage (subtracted 1lb ground beef), and a 12oz bottle of beer.  I also substituted diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice.  Again, the base recipe is fantastic.

This was really good. The flavor reminded me of the chili you buy at Wendy's--but better.  I followed the recipe for the most part, keeping the spices the same with the exception of adding 1 TB worchestire.  I used one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and then filled that same can twice with tomatoe juice. It just seemed strange not to have some diced tomatoes in chili! I also added two drained cans of red beans, instead of 2 cups.  Just read the recipe wrong, but I'm glad I did.  I probably had an extra 1/2 pound of hamburger. One more comment:  I made one batch the night before and the next one the next morning.  The one that had cooked longer was less sweet... go figure!

Only changes I made were adding 1/2 can of drained whole kernel and a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. I did use 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chillies in place of the tomato juice, simply because that is what I had on hand. Had several chili recipes in my box until I tried this one, now i only have one.

fantastic! i used 1 can chili beans, 1 can red beans, 1 can great northern beans, and 2 cans of black beans and then followed others suggestions to use tomato sauce (instead of juice) and petite diced tomatoes (instead of sauce). Towards the end, I realized that it did need more liquid so I added about 30 oz. of V8 juice for health reasons and flavor. I omitted the green pepper because I didn't have any but added some sauteed shredded carrots. Delicious!

First time to use tomato juice in a chili and my kidlets approved. Very kid friendly chili recipe because it doesn't have a lot of hot spices. I did cook everything up and left it in the crockpot for 8 hours to simmer out the water.

I made this recipe last night and it was delish! I did however take suggestions from other reviewers and substituted tomato sauce for the tomato juice and I used diced tomato in place of the tomato sauce.  This recipe isa great base for any chili recipe and can be adapted to whatever tastes you're cooking for. It's even better on day 2 :) Thanks to George Couch for a great recipe!

best chili. I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted the tomato juice for a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chicken broth. I didn't add celery because I didn't have any and I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Amazing!

Great recipe, but try using V8 instead of plain tomato juice. I use that for my chili and love it. For more spice, use the Spicey V8 for a kick.

This was the easiest recipe ever and I felt like a chef!  It was so yummy and hearty and again EASY! I sub-ed tomoto sauce for the juice and diced onions for the sauce. And I used kidney beans. Enjoy!

This is an excellent chili recipe. I've been to other sites looking for a basic recipe that I could tweak to my family and my tastes and this was it(although I didn't do much tweaking, except for extra spices).  My dish is on the stove and isn't finished yet, but tastes awesome already.  Thanks George.

Best chili i have ever had. I use to hate chili and i just made it because my husband was bugging me to make chili for a while and he loves it too. His co workers loved it as well for the pot luck. i am going to keep making this for as long as i live!

Very good basic chili recipes.  Like others suggested, I left out the tomato juice and instead used petite diced tomatoes.  Always a big hit in my house.

I made the recipe mostly as is, minus the green pepper and added 1 can kidney and 1 can red beans for interest, oh and only 1 lb beef--perfect porportion to the other ingredients. The flavor was great, not too tomato-ey/glorified tomato soup as other reviewers said. The consistency was perfect.  Also, a great balance of sweet and spicy.  However, it could stand to be a bit hotter to me and I'm not a lover of super spicey foods.  I made it for guests and got nothing but compliments.  They were curious what was in it to give it such a unique flavor. Served with sliced green onions, sour cream and cornbread.

This is the most delicious chili! I have never made chili before and this recipe was also easy to follow.  My family absolutely looooved it!! I did read the other reviews and substitute the tomato sauce for the juice and then sliced tomatoes for the sauce.  Yummy!!

What a fantastic chili recipe and thanks to George for sharing it! It's so easy to make and delicious. I changed two things because its what I had on hand. I used stewed tomatoes in onion, celery and green peppers instead of tomato sauce. I had no ground cayenne peppers so I doused it with Tabasco sauce :)))  I will definitely make this again and again.

Even great using shredded chicken. I make the base of the chili (without the meat) in a crockpot and then use some of the liquid from it to cook the chicken (cut into cubes or strips) in a separate pan. Once fully cooked I toss it in with the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot and let cook for 8 hours.

I make this fairly often, but I have trimmed the meat to one pound of 93% lean ground turkey, and I am using three cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice / sauce.  I cut the chili powder down to 2 tbsp to reduce the sodium, and I don't include any salt.  I throw in as many veggies as the crock pot will allow, and it still tastes great!

Very good recipe.  I  substituted, using tomato sauce and diced tomatoes.  I also diced two bulbs of garlic and added.  I salteed all of the veggies before adding to pot.  Lastly, I added two small dashes of cinnamon.  Delicioso!

This is a great base recipe as others mentioned. I substituted the tomato juice for sauce and sauce for diced tomatoes and for some reason, my chili came out with a strong tomato flavor. Too strong for my liking so I added some more spices, sauteed jalapenos in butter-poured it in, and added a tablet of Abuelita-Mexican style chocolate, and added cornstarch. The chocolate gave it a suddle mole flavor. I will try this recipe again but maybe follow the rules next time to see how it is originally =)

This is BY FAR my favorite chili recipe!  The first time I made it I only had a large can of vegetable juice instead of tomato juice.  I was worried it would make it spicy, but it still turned out wonderfully.  I also used real garlic instead of powder.

this is still simmering in the pot but i tried it once it got warm just to test the spices and this will be the best chili i will have to date.. (sorry dad) i'm not sure if i got the right beans. i was in a hurry at the store. i just got 2 cans of chili ready beans. they were on sale. the diced tomatoes i used were chili ready too. i couldn't find cayenne pepper at the store (they were all out) so i just used crushed red pepper for spice. tastes awesome.

GREAT recipe!!  I know it's good when my husband has a second helping.  The cayenne pepper adds a perfect spice.  I eliminated the celery just because we didn't have any at the house....I will be making it again and again.  Thank you for sharing!

This chili was simple to make and oh so good!!  My boys, especially my 14-yr-old, LOVED it.  For my personal taste, next time, I will probably go a little easier on the cumin.  But that's just me, the rest of my family loved it as is.  THANKS for this "keeper".

I have made this recipe twice! It was a huge hit both times. I just took it to a college tailgate party this past weekend, (doubled the recipe )and didn't have any leftover! (I did sub diced tomatoes for the Tomato juice though. sorry)

I did a lot of chili recipe testing a few years ago using recipes from the Food Network site. My favorite was Emeril's Chuck Wagon Chili w/ some of the veggies from his Vegetarian chili. The flavors are amazing. But I wanted to try something new + start checking out AllRecipes, and so I made this chili (despite it's regular everyday chili ingredients) thinking there must be something fantastic about it because of the reviews. I'm eating it right now. It's ok. I added cheese to flavor it up some. It's good - I'm enjoying it - but I dont see why it's getting so many awesome reviews. I dont think it's terrible but I dont think it steps outside the bounds of just an average chili.

This Chili is AMAZING! I substituted the tomato juice for tomato sauce and the tomato sauce for diced tomatoes as others recommended, I also doubled the beans. I'm sure it would be just as great as is I just like a little more protein and the sauce and diced tomatoes make it a bit thicker. The seasoning is dead on!

I made this chili exactly as the recipe called and it was fantastic!!  I; however, didn't cook it for the 1 1/2 it suggested because we were too hungry.  We let it cook for about 30 minutes and it still gets great reviews from us.  I served it with rice and also with fritos and it was great with both!  I will certainly keep this recipe handy.

This definitely was spicy but was enjoyed.  Our oldest son, who does NOT like spice .. I told him he had to at least taste it.  Well, despite the heat, he ate 2 bowl of it, but just enjoyed it along with FOUR glasses of water to cut the heat.  Rather funny because usually he just won't touch hot stuf.  I did add an extra can of home canned tomatoes.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used V8 juice (one can)

This is a great recipe. I ended up using a can of crushed tomatoes, one can of tomato paste and then about a cup and a half of water. The sauce cooks down nicely. I also added two diced smoked chipotles to add a little bit of that smokey flavor and extra heat. Turned out fantastic- perfect for a rainy, cold fall night!

Awesome.  I did a can of red beans & a can of pinto, and as recommended just added tomato juice at the end until I got the right consistency/thickness. Also, left out the celery. Really really delicious.  My new chili standard. :)

So easy to make with wonderful flavor. This is a fall and winter favorite in my household. So thankful I found this recipe! The only change I make is leaving out the celery as I cannot stand the taste.

This chili is the bomb! I added steak and ground beef for the meat and also added a can of S & W stewed tomatoes for a more chunky tomato taste. As other reviews stated, it does freeze well; however, it didn't stay frozen for too long as I used the leftovers 3 nights later for chili dogs! I will always use this recipe from now on. It is easy and delicious!

So AMAZING! I followed recipe to a T. I did let it cook for over 2 hrs and that helped it thicken up perfectly. Tastes like Wendy's Chilli (which I love!) Rave reviews from neighbors and the hubs.

Yum,Yum!  We used "Franks Red Hot Sauce" instead of Cayenne pepper, which is basically the same, but liquid. It gave the chili just the right "zing" to make your mouth water for more.

I make this according to the original recipe. It's easy, it's delicious and it's a favourite at our house. I made it for the hot lunch program at the kids' school, although omitted the cayenne for that occasion. It was the most requested for "seconds". Thanks for sharing!!

The recipe was easy and very yummy.  We followed the recipe exactly and for the most part it was great.  There was a lot of beans compared to how little of an amount of meat there was.  I would either add more meat of decrease the amount of beans.  With these changes, I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good.  Made this one to recipe.  Does come out a bit thin, but thickens some over time.  Taste is pretty good, but I'm still searching for THE chili recipe.

Only advice: leave it as is! Although due to lack of beans, I put in lentils, and it tasted just as good!

I made this chili for the superbowl and it was delicious.  So easy to prepare.  My family ate the entire kettle of chili in two sittings.  Serve with some crusty bread, perhaps some chedder cheese to top and you have yourself a definite keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I use a can of navy beans and a can of black beans in place of kidney beans.  Instead of using tomato juice and the like, I use 1-2 large cans of tomato sauce.  I also add a clove of garlic, some crushed red pepper, paprika, italian seasoning(instead of oregano), and normally a little more cumin.  It's scrumptious!

I made this recipe as written and we really enjoyed it.  The flavor was excellent.  I found it a little to salty for my taste and will not add the additional salt next time.  Also, it was very thin so I will try to thicken it as other reviewers suggested.  I think I will also try to cook the onions and celery with the meat so they are softer in the end.  They were too crunchy for my taste.

This is a great recipe! We like using it to make chilidogs and top with onions and saurkraut!  I do add a little corn flour at the end to make it slightly thicker.

It's not very spicy, so people who don't like spicy things will enjoy this just as much as people who like spice (and those people can put extra chili powder in their own bowls!). I used diced beef instead of ground, and it came out perfect. This is definitely the best potluck chili I have ever made (and I've made a LOT)!

I have used this recipe multiple times mostly for the spice combo!  I would lazily use a spice packet in the past. It was a good one, but it was so full of sodium!  I can control the salt this way and also tweak the spices how I want (I triple the cumin - yum!) ALSO in place of some of the juice/sauce I use one 12 oz can of V8 - it adds something sweet and extra veggie in the background.

This chili is AWESOME!  I make it in my crockpot.  My only tip is to make it a day ahead and reheat when ready to eat.  Tastes amazing.

My husband is a very picky eater, and hates both onions and peppers. He loved this! My toddler also gobbled it up, so it's not too spicy for young kids.

So Halloween was here and I needed some help.  Found this recipe and thank goodness.  I was able to throw it all together.  We didn't simmer it for and hour and a half and it was still yummy.  Lots leftover to freeze.  We've used the leftovers in chili mac and chili dogs.  YUMM...

Made this recipe for a birthday party and wow! everyone loved it.  I did what a few people did and substituted tomato sauce for the juice and diced tomatoes for the sauce.  The spices worked so well together and it had just the right bit to it.  It was the first thing to go at the party.  My husband ask me to make this more often.  This will be my only chili recipe now.  Thanks!

I made this last night for my husband and parents.  Great Chili!!  My mom asked for the recipe.  My changes (minor) was I did 1 lb ground turkey and 1lb ground hamburger, added only 1 can of chili beans instead of 2.  I also chose to use Prego Chunky Vegetable pasta sauce.  I'll make it the same way again in a few weeks for a baby shower.  Thanks!!

The only changes I made to this recipe were: I only added 1 small can of tomato sauce (398ml),and then added same size diced tomatoes. I also added the 1/4 cup of cornmeal like others. Perfect!

This is our "go to" chili recipe!  We always have an empty pot and folks asking for the recipe when served at gatherings.  We do use 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground chuck with this recipe, but is is PERFECT, as is.  Thanks to the submitter.

Very, very good chili!!  Made just a few changes, based on reviews from others.  I sauteed the onions with the hamburger.  Added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with onions instead of the tomato juice, and I also added a bit more salt, a bit more sugar and a touch of ketchup (believe it or not!).  Otherwise, followed the recipe to a T. Hubby loved it!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Good chili. I altered like this: used 2 cans plum tomatoes; 2 tiny cans tomato juice; half can of beer; 1 can kidney beans & 1 can black beans. I pureed the tomatoes w/ some of the beans, which thickened it up nicely. Served w/ shredded cheddar & blue corn chips and a simple salad.

This is the first time I made homemade chili and it turned out good. The only thing I changed was the red beans. I used pinto beans. Plus I added some hot sauce. All I can say is thank you so much for helping me make great homemade chili for the first time. Yum Yum

Great chili recipe. I tweeked it ever so slightly, adding 2 cans of diced tomatos and cutting back on the tomato juice(I like chunks of tomatoes in my chili) and substituting Quorn crumbles for the meat (I am a vegetarian). This is a real "thumbs up" dish. Enjoy.

Excellent. Came out a bit soupy so I seperated the liquid so I ended up with thick chili and sauce that I used the next week with spaghetti.

My girlfriend made some chili which was the best I had ever had. I forgot to get her recipe so searched for one. This is it. I now make this chili recipe about every 2 weeks. The only thing I change is the using pinto and small white beans instead of kidney beans. Depending how long I let it cook (sometimes several hours) I add some more tomato or vegetable juice and more chili powder to taste. My teenage son and his friends LOVE this on chili dogs with grilled onions and shredded cheese.  I love it by itself. Thank you so much.

I think there is too much cumin in this recipe. Mine smells and tastes like taco meat, and it is very thick. I followed the recipe exactly (I am the kind of person who can't change the recipe or it flops), and I'm not that impressed.

This is awesome!  I cooked the meat first and then cooked in the crock pot for 6 hours.  I added V8 and diced tomatoes and kidney/black beans at the end.

After many attempts at making homemade chili- this is by far the best.  I decrease the amount of tomato juice to only 16 ounces, use one can tomato sauce and two cans of diced tomatoes, other than that, follow the recipe exactly-  I leave it in the slow cooker all day making all the tastes run together very nicely.  Served with cheese and sour cream in bread bowls- mmmm mmmm good!

8 years after finding this recipe, it's still the one I come back to every time. You really don't need to change a thing, other than adjusting spice to your likes. This is a fall and winter staple in our house.

A hearty, meaty basic chili recipe. This is the grandchildren's favorite. After cooking beans from scratch this is one of our favorite 'leftover' recipes.

Great base recipe! I changed the same things as many others did. (sauce for juice and stewed tomatoes for sauce )and I added a one more tsp of chili powder. I also sateed 5 cloves of garlic along with the chopped up onions and green peppers and I still used the 1 1/2 tsp of powdered garlic.

i have made this recipe for a few months now it has been a huge success. i did make a couple changes just due to personal preference. i add 2 cans of dark red kidney beans as well as 2 cans of diced tomatoes. i also add a jalapeno and half the seeds for more spice. i do not add the entire bottle of tomato juice in on most occasions - i found with the extra tomatoes it can make it too soupy - i let it cook for a while and then add only as needed. the last two times i have made this i used ground turkey and found that both my husband and i liked it better. this really is an easy recipe and it makes great leftovers and freezes well too.

Wow was this an awesome chili!  I was a bit skeptical looking at the ingredients... but made it near-exactly as stated.  (I used one can of chili beans and one can of red beans, rather than two cans of red beans.)  The flavors are subtle and complex at the same time.  The ratio of everything is perfect -- a little crunchy, a little spicy, a little meaty.  This makes a gigantic portion.  I served it the next day to a family that snubs their noses at leftovers -- but added in macaroni.  We had chilimac and it was still tasted great.  Again everyone enjoyed it.  This is my new recipe!  Thank you for sharing it.

I am a full time college student and this is one of the best chili recipes I've ever had, it was quick, cheap, filling and I had everyone in my dorm dipping into our crock pot for this chili.  I added a little more chilli pepper just because I am a sucker for spice, but everything else was just perfect!!!  Everything worked well in concert with each other, and it was a cheap and easy recipe to make!  I will definitely add this to my routine

This is THE chili recipe! It would be great as is, but I recommend a few modifications. Instead of the tomato juice I use tomato sauce and instead of the tomato sauce I use petite diced tomatoes as others have suggested. I also use a whole green pepper and add mined garlic (fresh or jarred). For a little spice, I add chopped smoked roasted green chilies and add more cayenne pepper then in the recipe. For the beans, I enjoy 1 can of dark kidney and 1 can of black.

Good as written, better if you substitute the sauce for paste or diced tomatoes. I've made this numerous times and I just add the seasonings at random, I don't measure them out (but I did the first time I made this). It's a good recipe to use if you don't want to experiment, but it's also good as a base if you want to add additional ingredients or different amounts of spices.

This was very good!  We used spicy bloody mary mix in place of the tomato juice for extra spice.

I used crushed tomatoes instead of tom juice, also had no hamburger so used steak cut into small pieces.  VERY GOOD.

I used 1/2 the called for ground beef and added another pound or so of stewing beef cut into bite sized chunks.  It made the chili that much hartier, and I like the texture of cut beef as well as the ground.  A great recipe for winter games or movie night with a crowd, cause it's even better done a day ahead and re heated.

I used minced garlic instead of powder and sauted the onion and garlic before browning the meat. Then added everything but the beans to my crock pot in the last hour I added the beans. Good chili, everyone loved it. Thanks

Excellent chili! My husband is very picky and quite honestly, I didn't expect him to eat this chili because he hates vegetables. Turns out, he loved it! He keeps asking me to make it again.

this recipe is awesome! dont change it the way it is! the only thing i did different was sprinkle in some onion powder. i also left out the peppers, onions and celery and put those on the side for people who dont like veggies in their chili. i sprinkled on some shredded cheese and served with warm bread and butter. everybody loved it! this was the first time i ever made chili and i cant believe how much of a success it was!

A great recipe. I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice, omitted the green pepper and added some canned sweet corn. I like things hot so I tossed in some jarred jalepeno peppers. Small changes really and this recipe is so flexible that you can tweek it however you choose.

LOVE this recipe! I am done searching for a Chili recipe. I made this recipe without make any changes for lunch one day. My Husband and I decided to try out how different the taste would be if we left it simmering until dinner time. The taste was so much better with time. I highly recommend making this ahead of time and allowing to simmer at least 3 hours to really make the flavors pop.

This is a great chili recipe. My family loved it and said it was the best chili they'd ever had. The only changes I made were to use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 mild Italian sausage and I substituted diced tomatoes with the liquid for the tomato juice.

I'm not a good cook but this was super easy! I didn't do it stove top though. I felt i wouldn't have a big enough pan. I used the crock pot. I also used veggie juice instead of tomato juice. YUMMY!

This recipe is the best, and easiest, chili I have ever made. I only made one change to the recipe and that was to leave out the celery (because I don't like it) and added a can of spicy peppers.

Great recipe!! I just tried it last night and switched out the tomato juice for diced tomatoes based on other reviews. I also sauteed the onion and added two cloves of minced garlic to the pan.  The result was fantastic. I'm not typically one for measuring ingredients and it didn't matter. In the end, I added more cayenne for our own tastes. Topped off the bowls with some shredded cheese and served with tortilla chips - yum!! Easy and I will make this again.

Mmmmm...Definitely going in the favorites box! Threw all the ingredients in a crock pot on low all day.  Slaved over another soup that was not nearly as good. I usually regret trying new recipes when having company, but not this time. Super easy and very popular with our guests. Thanks!

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times since first learning of it and it went over well at a 2008 Super Bowl Party.  The best thing about it is it's so easy to make and takes less than 30 minutes altogether.  The only change I've made is, I use canned tomatoes instead of tomatoe juice.  It makes for a chunkier chili.

This was a perfect chili recipe.  Super easy and very flavorful; not too spicy which works well with my 2 year old.  I used a tiny bit less chili powder then called for and per some other suggestions used a large tin of diced tomatoes instead of using tomato juice.  Other then that I followed the recipe to a T.  Will definitely be using this as my regular chili recipe. Thanks!

I have to start by saying that I do not like to change a recipe and then rate it. I like to make the recipe as written, I will read the reviews and take the most popular suggestions and follow them. However, with this recipe I started to make this thinking that I had all of the ingredients but I quickly found out that I did not! I browned the ground beef, added the chopped onion and celery. Then I added 1 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes because I did not have a large can of tomato sauce. I had 1 16 oz can of tomato sauce. Then I added 1 small can of tomato paste, brown sugar and water. I hated that I changed it so much but this is what I had to work with. Other than the changes I had to make, everything else was as written and I have to say everyone here loved it! It is a really fantastic chili. I will make this over and over!

Very disappointed.  Spicy but not in a good way.  Way too much chili powder.  It overwhelmed all the other flavors.  I felt like I could have licked chili powder off a spoon and got the same effect.

I have looked at many recipes, and simple is better for me! If I can achieve the same thing in less time, than why not?!

This is a great recipe alone, but can be adjust so easily to fit anyone!

I've been looking for a chili like this for years. It's so tomatoey (word?) and delicious! It's not a thick chili but has a rich, flavorful soupiness (word?) to it. Great spice level. I took the liberty to add a can of stewed tomatoes (yum!) and a little bit more celery, green pepper and onion. We had corn bread muffins with it and wow, was it every a compliment to this just right spice level chili!! Amazing! Thank you! I'll probably never even try another chili recipe again. It's perfect!

We enjoyed this chili made just the way the recipe dictates.  Our version was cooked in the crock pot for about six hours on low.  We enjoyed tasting the different layers of spicing.

I doubled this because I like to make chili and freeze it in individual servings.  I have made this recipe before and didn't realize that I didn't review it.  This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was that I only used a half of a pound of hamburger to cut the calorie content.  The flavor is just right.

This is BY FAR THE BEST CHILI my family and I have had.  Instead of measuring out 2 cups of red kidney beans, I just used 2 cans.  It was a little more than the recipe called for, but it was great!~

This was terrific.  Followed recipe exactly.  Great flavor but not very hot for chili.  Added some jalapeno juice and habanero sauce and it made things just right.

Add bacon at the end on top of your bowl and experience a foodgasm.  It was sooo good.  I normally don't like chili but this one won me over.

4.5 if that was an option on the rating scale. I add mushrooms simply because I like them. Great recipe and I've made this every year just as the weather starts to turn to fall. Then every month just to keep in practice.

Darn good!  I did not change a thing, except I cooked it early in the morning and let it sit all day before warming it up again. I served it with monteray cheese, sour cream and garlic toast-perfect for a cool fall day!

Came out really well. It was a great balance of flavor's, except that it tasted a bit to tomatoey, so I added another tablespoon of chili powder. Everyone loved it!  I also add sausage to the mix.

Wow!  Very good chili.  Instead of using tomato jice and tomato sauce, I used fresh tomatoes.  I took other viewer's suggestions and increased chili powder and ground cayenne.  This is my new chili recipe.  Thanks.

My family - 3 kids included really enjoys this recipe. We leave out the celery and bell pepper. I use one 15 oz can tomato sauce, one can of petite diced tomatoes with green chiles and the I add the tomato juice until it's the consistency we like - usually about 2/3 of the total recommended amount of juice. Then I just adjust the spices to our tastes - I add a smidge more cayenne and salt. Other than that, I follow the listed amounts. We love it!

Excellent recipe, a keeper & I will definitely make again (and again).  I am a "first time exact recipe follower" but I did change things, only because I got about 1/2 way through it and realized I didn't have all the ingredients.  I subbed refrigerated minced garlic for the garlic powder (1/2 tsp in the browning meat, 3/4 tsp in the liquid mixture) and subbed 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for the cayenne.  Next time I will make it exactly as written.  I would say, though, that it is a forgiving recipe if you want to change it up.  I also sauteed the onions & celery prior to putting it liquid mix as hubby likes the veggies very tender in chili.  We like it spicy, so we topped it with jalepenos, cheese and a dash of tabasco :)

I made this for end of season tea for a cricket team along with trays of wraps and sandwiches and cakes...the cvhili was the first thing to go, I had to triple the recipe and the only thing I changed was that I omitted the onion as my b/f doesn't like it, and I couldn't put any garlic as I ran out on the first sprinkle, and I added mushrooms. It was an absolute hit. Thank you for sharing!

Yum! The only thing I changed was omitted the onion because I don't like them, and I used a red pepper instead of green because that is what I had. This was a big hit! My new favorite chili recipe.

Excellent chili recipe!  Just the right amount of ingredients.  I made this the night before so it had plenty of time for the juices and flavors to mingle.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Thanx for sharing.

This was delicious!  My husband isn't crazy about chili but he liked this one, he said it didn't taste bitter like some chilis.  The only changes we made were to use ground turkey and we used 1 can of light kidney beans, 1 can of dark kidney beans and 1 can of black beans.  I also added about 1/2 cup of cornmeal because we like chili thick.

This was my first time making chili and it was so good. Everyone always loves it when I make this. For my inlaws I usually add chopped jalipeno because the like it extra spicy. Thanks for a great chili.

I'm giving this 5 Stars.  Easy to make, doesn't require any exotic ingredients and great just the way it is.  I tweaked it a little bit the next several times by increasing the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper.  If you like a little more fire in your chili, double up with the cayenne and increase the chili powder.

This is a GREAT chili. I recently made it for my father-in-law and won him over. Believe me this is no easy accomplishment. I season to taste frequently adding more cayenne pepper and cumin and less chili powder. For a different variation and real tomato taste I add a large can of diced tomatoes.I simmered for a few hours until my guests arrived and it was the perfect consistency.

This is the first Chili I've ever made and it far exceeds my expectations.  I'm not sure its exactly right because some of the ingrediants listed have a different definition here (New Zealand) but I think I got it pretty spot on, very very nice and I will be making it often this winter.

A big hit with my picky boyfriend.  I used a can of fat-free refried beans, a can of red beans, and a large can of pinto beans to give it a thicker consistency (I probably could have even used another can of refried beans).  I used an entire bell pepper, a jalapeno and two habaneros, all finely chopped.  It's a fantastic recipe.

This was great!  I made it for a superbowl party, and served it with Fritos, sour cream, cheese and green onions.  I always kind of wing recipes, so i used 1lb ground beef, and 1lb ground sausage.  I also omitted the tomato juice and just used 3 cans of diced tomatoes with the juice.  This had some heat!  Thanks for the post :)

I have searched for years for a great chili recipe - and I've finally found one!!  After reading all the reviews - I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible - but with what I had on hand.  I didn't have tomato juice - so I mixed a can of tomato paste with beer to make the 46oz.  No tomato sauce - so I used canned diced tomatoes (with juice) instead.  Lastly - I didn't have ground beef - but I did have ground venison - so I used it.  Next time I'll actually make a trip to the store and get everything I need.  Because - if it is this good with the few changes I had to make to accommdate my pantry - I can't imagine how good it would be following the recipe exactly.  This is a winner!!!!!!

This was really fantastic chili, George! Just the right amount of spice and heat. I like that, then others are able to increase the heat at the table to their liking. This was really soupy and my husband loved that aspect. I chopped up 1 onion, 3 stalks of celery split lengthwise then chopped, and a half a green pepper. I couldn't find the garlic powder lost in my myriad of unorganized spices, so I tossed in a couple of tsps. of minced garlic. My only addition was an extra can of beans, 1/2 tsp of chipotle chile pepper and 1/2 tsp ancho chile pepper powder. I simmered this for 3 hours with the lid on. This was awesome chili and definitely highly recommended, but our personal favorite is still chili I.

Hi everyone - my husband and I made this chili for a chili dinner at church this evening and it was delicious.  We added red beans for some filler and kicked it up with a little Texas Pete sauce -- but it would have been fine without the stuff we added ... very good and easy recipe (and it fits a crock pot perfectly!) ...

THis was really good.  I made it exactly as directed except for the omission of the cayenne pepper, as I will be sharing with people who won't like it too spicy.  Next time I make it for just us, i will be adding it!  This is my first time making homemade chili, and I don't think I will even need to continue my recipe search.  This tastes just as good as any of the best chilis I have had!

Absolutley the best chili I have ever tasted.  Everyone loves it.  My husband of course adds a few dashes of Tabasco, but he adds that to everything!  We normally are feeding two adults and two children.  The leftovers are devoured for several days, as this makes ALOT of chili.  I will never try another chili recipe!  This is the one for me!

Been making this for the past 10 years and it’s always a hit. I pretty much follow the recipe as written with occasional substitutions - 32 is of V8 juice,a can of Rotel, and maybe done tom paste - just depends on what I have on hand. Total liquid always equals that of the recipe. We like it a little thinner so we can spoon it over the large “scoop” style corn chips. Yum,yum,yum! Gotta go make some...

Yummy, Nummy and all that jazz!  This was a little more work than I am used to when making chili but DEFINITELY worth it!  One small addition for my family - chopped jalapenos - we like it HOT!  This was ever better the second day, reheated.  The flavors just blossomed.  Thanks for the greatest chili recipe I've found yet!

Great recipe, the celery, pepper and oniion really add to the flavor. I substituted 2lbs of soy crumbles and added a little more zing by increasing the ceyenne.

This is fabulous!  I have never been able to make a "great" chili and last night I became the "chili queen" in my house.  Because of children, I did cut back on the chili powder and omitted the peppers.  Once again.....this is by far the VERY BEST CHILI!!!!

This is the best chili I've ever had! The only thing I did differently was adjust the amount of tomato juice by more than half b/c I like a thicker chili. Great Recipe!

This was a great base for me to make chili from!  I made it vegetarian so altered some things.
-No meat
-6 cans of various beans a handful of fake sausage crumbles
-added carrots and red pepper
-threw in a can of tomato paste.
I loved it!  Even my 2 1/2 year old daughter loved it!

We are chili lovers and this recipe is awesome!!  I did subsitute tomato sauce for juice and diced tomatoes for sauce like the other reviewers suggested and I also added a seranno pepper along with another can of beans to the mix, left out celery and used red pepper (a whole one) not green.  Delicious and spicey!!

This was a GREAT base recipe to build my idea of the 'ultimate' chili recipe upon.  

Much like the other reviewers, I tweaked this recipe to my own tastes.  Here is what I did:

I browned my ground beef, then added it to a large pot with 4-15oz cans plain tomato sauce and 2-12oz can V8 low-sodium veggie juice.  In the pan I browned the beef in, I then browned 2Tbsp minced garlic, 2Tbsp chopped green chilis (canned), and a chopped sweet vidalia onion, omitting the bell pepper (not one of my favorites).  To the tomato mixture, I omitted the garlic powder (since I already added minced garlic at the beginning), added 1/2 tsp ground coriander, 1 Tbsp paprika, and instead of the 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) of regular chili powder, I doubled the amount (we like a very stron chili!) and changed the proportions to 6 Tbsp regular chili powder, 1 Tbsp Ancho chili powder, and 1 Tbsp Chipotle chili powder, which gave the chili a wonderfully slightly sweet, smoky undercurrent.  Oh, and I also added 1/2 cup red wine and a full bottle of lager beer to the tomato sauce.  Finally, I added about 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice and a nice big pinch of dill to the mix.  Then I brought the chili to a boil and let it simmer about a half hour.

So, like I said, I tweaked everything to our tastes and preferences, but ultimately, this was a wonderful base recipe to build upon.  Great mix of flavors, great amount of heat, and definitely a crowd-pleaser!

I don't like when people rate recipes and change half of the ingredients but I'm guilty since I live in the middle east and can't always find some things. However, even if I had made it as directed I still would have given it 5 stars...I'm guessing. It was a HUGE hit and people were taking three and four helpings. I added a lot more heat to it (hot indian chili powder) and used watered down tomato soup instead of the juice. Thanks so much!

Very good chili recipe. I made this for a dinner club group I belong to and everyone enjoyed it. The recipe is good as is but I did make a few modifications. I added: half can of beer, only used half the tomato juice, subbed Turkey for beef, used 2 cans of red beans. Left out the celery, subbed one red bell pepper for the green one.

Great chili!  Didn't add any salt at all because I don't like things salty and I love beans so added more.  Try this, you won't be disappointed!

This was the first time I've made chili. It was pretty tasty, but it was on  the meaty side for my family, which is just because my family isn't a big meat-eater. I was afraid that it would come out too salty, so I used low-sodium V-8 vegetable cocktail and added more salt to my liking later. I also used fresh garlic instead of powdered (I never use garlic powder), substituted 1 can of red beans with pinto beans, and substituted 1 can of diced tomato with juice instead of tomato sauce. I served this with homemade cornbread, and the meal was hearty. Next time, though, I will cut down on meat and add other vegetables, like more bell peppers, tomatoes and add zucchini, green beans etc.

This has become my tried and true 'go-to' chili recipe!  I don't like my chili spicy, so use less chili powder and omit the cayenne pepper.  Instead of 48 oz can of tomato juice, I use 48 oz can of whole tomatoes.... I like the chunky tomatoes in there..... tons of compliments on this.... thanks!!!

Delicious chili! I made it in a crock pot, cut the tomato juice in half and added diced tomatoes. Next time I'll leave out the tomato juice and just use diced tomatoes - the liquid didn't reduce in the crock pot like it would on the stove, so it wasn't as thick as we would have liked.

This is the best chili recipe that I've tried.  I doubled all the spices (except the chili powder) because my family likes it spicy, used all black beans (that's all I had), and served it with sour cream, cheese, and scallions.  Delicious!!

I love this chili!  I have made it several times since finding this recipe.  I change up the veggies depending on what I have in the refrigerator, but always add zucchini and yellow squash and let it simmer with all the flavors.  I make a big pot and freeze in smaller bags to take to work for lunch.  It's a healthy alternative and so EASY.  This is a definite keeper recipe for chili in my house, everyone loves it.

This satisfied my craving for some good chili. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and added fresh garlic rather than garlic powder. I doubled the amount of cayenne for extra kick and next time I will add some diced jalapenos, though the recipe has plenty of spice without it. Thanks George!

I followed the recipe 100%, no changes whatsoever and I love this chili.  I detest tomato juice, but used it reluctantly.

I was very pleasantly surprised at the smooth, thick (but not too thick for me) consistency and the bit of a bite and unique flavor of this chili. 

My husband loves it, my picky 13 year old son likes it, and my daughters even pickier 16 year old boyfriend is eating it (and enjoying it) as I write this. My daughter wouldn't try it.  

I will absolutlely make this again, it's my new chili recipe, the old one can't touch this.

Very good! I cut the recipe in half, and used a whole can of tomato sauce instead of half sauce & half juice, and left out the tomato paste. We are a mixed meat-eating/vegetarian family, so I divided it into two portions and added cooked ground buffalo meat to one portion and fried crumbled tempeh to the other portion. Everyone loved it!

Great chili!  I added some fresh hot peppers (we like our chili hot) and substituted vegetarian crumbles for half of the ground beef to reduce the calories.  This will be our chili standard from now on.

This is the best chili we have ever had.  Follow the recipe exactly.  I have also used canned crushed tomatoes and canned chopped tomatoes - also terrific (more substantial).  You must try this chili!

This is now the ONLY chili my family will eat.  They liked the consistency and the spice was perfect.  We're trying it with deer meat next time since we have some in the freezer.  Excellent recipe!!!

Well, I made this for the Superbowl and all I can say is "GREAT"! I followed the recipe, but I omitted the beans (wasn't sure if the kids at the party would turn up their noses). Everyone who ate it, raved about it. I doubled the recipe to serve 20 and it still came out fantastic. I will add the beans the next time since I like beans. We are eating the leftovers tonight and can't wait. Thanks for the recipe George!

Instead of the tomato juice I used stewed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, and Rotel tomatoes, omitted the oregano, used brown sugar instead of white, then substituted black beans for the red beans.  Even though I made some minor changes the spices were perfect for us.  I rated this recipe 4 because I just thought the tomato juice was not the best choice.  I just let it simmer on low in my slow cooker all day filling my home with that comfort food smell!

This chili is D-E-Licious! This was my first time making chili. It was easy and it doesn't require a lot of crazy ingredients. It has the right amount of spice to start with. I like my chili spicey, so I added more red pepper. This is going to be added to my favorite recipes.

This chili came up flat to me.  I felt that it lacked a lot of flavor ( I know I am going against the grain.) I would not make this again.

Made it once, and that was it....even the picky ones request it.  Now that it gets so dark early, everyone wants CC's chili (I always say, “you mean Flatlander?”), Cheese, green onion and sour cream on top makes it better than perfect. (Some of the older kids want it spooned over a baked potato!) YUM, thank you =)

This recipe is outstanding - I did add an extra can of red beans, along with black beans for the protein content.  The spices were great.  For serving, I put shredded cheese, and chopped green onions on the top, along with some sour cream...definitely a hit with our family!

Awesome!!  It was really good. The entire family enjoyed it.  The spices were just right.  The only thing I changed were the beans. I used black beans and pinto beans instead, we do not like the red beans. I will definately make it again.

This recipe rocks!  I love the combo of spices.  I added a small can of corn, a large can of tomatoes (I think that's 28 oz) and an additional can of beans.  But that's chili - you can do whatever you want.  It's the base ingredients that make this a good one!  The spices and the tomato juice and sauce.

This was absolutely delicious.  I was a bit concerned about the amount of chili powder in the recipe but was very happy with the end result.  Turned out thick, had  just the right amount of spice and was just fantastic!  Served with cheese and sour cream on top, along with homeade cornbread.  Yum!  I did add a couple things to the recipe to add additional flavor...1 small can diced green chiles and 1 small can of diced tomatoes for texture.  You will NOT be disappointed with this recipe!  :)

Excellent chili.  I brown the ground beef and then add all ingredients to the crockpot.  Cook on low all day.  I don't add the celery or oregano or salt and I use low-sodium tomato juice.  Leftovers are great on burgers and omelets.

My boyfriend made this for a football party yesterday and it was outstanding! He used only half of the tomato juice called for, and used a can of diced tomatoes, as others had suggested. He also added a can of corn and two whole jalapenos (he likes to eat them whole and cooked). The chili had the perfect amount of spiciness for us.

I really liked this recipe. The spice was perfect. Th reason I didn't give it a 5* rating is because of the tomato taste. It was a bit too strong for me. Other than that, it was great!

I'm not much of a Chili person but my husband and son love chili and after they put their empty bowls down,they gave this recipe a five. My husband reserved his vote for the second day saying chili was always better the next time around. This recipe has definately made it into my recipe collection. Thanks

Made for my husbands b'day party, everyone loved it. iinstead of 2 cans of tomato sauce, I used on can and then one large can of diced tomatoes.  I left out the green pepper and celery just because not enough time left, and I used way less chili powder then called for.  This was a mistake - would have had a great "kick" to it if I had been more generous. Overall - great recipe!!

Tasty, but not the best ever. I used a crock-pot on high for 4 hours and found that there was too much excess liquid. We served it over rice to soak up some of it up. I followed the advice of others and used V8 spicy and 2 tablespoons of chili powder. The heat factor was just right for my taste.

Recipe was good, but I thought it was a little too spicy.  I will make this again, but I will cut back on the chili powder next time.  I did make this in a crockpot which worked out beautifully.  It was extremely easy to make.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe rocks!  I was looking for a quick meal to serve my family and this was perfect.  The only thing I added was a package of fresh mushrooms and didn't use all of the suggested chili powder.  Along with the chili, I made a homemade loaf of Hawaiian Sweet Bread...mmm-mm.
This receipe is a keeper!

This chili does remind me of Wendy's chili, but better!

I just made this chili recipe for a teacher's luncheon at my son's school and have had numerous requests for the recipe.  It was a huge success.  I also took the advice of some previous reviews and used V8 juice in place of tomato juice.  Next time I might scale down just a touch on the chili powder.

Good, but watch the spices. I took the suggestions to use turkey and V-8. The turkey does change the texture. This started getting hot when I added the cumin. Cut the chili powder to 1 tbsp. Next time I try it I will cut the cumin and boost the chili powder in hope of getting a better blend.

If you are looking for THE chili recipe, this is IT!  Rarely do I follow a recipe to the letter, but this recipe is perfect as is.  V8 is a good addition if you do not have tomato juice.  Some great things to serve with it:  oyster crackers, sour cream, and/or sharp cheddar cheese...Yum! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

The spice of this chili was spot on. I did substitute one can of chili beans in hot sauce for one can of red beans and added a  28 oz can of diced tomatoes. Served with shredded cheddar cheese and Corn  chips on top. This is a fantastic chili recipe.

I am trying to incorporate more beans into my diet so tried this chili recipe.  I made a few changes based on what I had in my pantry.  I used all tomato sauce, no juice, no celery,  red pepper rather than green,  half a jalapeno rather than cayenne and no sugar.   I also grated in a small zuchini at the very end to get a little more veg in.  It was a huge hit and even better the second night.

This was my first chili in over a decade since I’m surrounded by people who make better chili than me and never needed to try. It’s a perfect starter recipe, especially with picky kids. The texture was really good and even though I forgot to buy green peppers it was very tasty. Us grownups just threw some chalula in ours and that kicked up enough for me. The leftovers made great chili dogs and overstuffed chili cheese omelets. It’s going on the regular dinner rotation!

Perfection... I used low fat ground turkey rather than ground beef and didn't drain the little bit of fat from the turkey, which worked just fine.

I accidentally put in 2 T cumin instead of 2 tsp. Oops....added more of the other dry ingrediants to try and get back to the recipe. I think I succeeded. This was amazing. The only change I made was to add 3 T polenta to thicken it up. Husband went bonkers over this chili.

It may just be personal preference (we're Texans) but I like mine a little spicier so I made the posted recipe then adjusted for taste by adding about 1/2 cup of mild green chili peppers and another tbsp of chili powder.

I switched the tomato juice for sauce and the sauce for fire roasted diced tomatoes & it was perfect!  It scored an A+ from every family member, which is a rarity at my house :) Thank you for a great chili recipe!

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was I used venison hot sausage instead of beef! It adds just a bit more heat and it’s extremely lean meat! It’s a favorite among our friends and is requested that I make it for our get togethers, paired with corn bread muffins you can’t go wrong! Getting ready to make a big batch today! ??

I have made this recipe more times than I can count - I know it by heart now.  It is ALWAYS my go to recipe; I don't make any other type of chili.  Just wanted to add that this also cooks up great in the instant pot for a super fast meal.  Just brown the meat and throw everything in.  I cook it at high pressure for 10 minutes tops and natural release, or just manually release if I'm in a hurry.  Depending on the size of your instant pot though you may need to make half a batch.  Also, word to the wise - a full batch is a huge amount of chili. That's never an issue for us because it reheats and freezes great, but just be aware if fridge or freezer space is an issue!

This is an amazing recipe, simple and full of flavor! I didn’t have any cayenne pepper so I substituted a scotch bonnet pepper from my garden, oh yeah! Thanks for sharing

This is my favorite chili recipe.  My family loves it!  It's a easy to adapt this recipe to your own tastes. I add a couple of small cans of V8 and diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice. If you take this to a potluck I guarantee you'll come home with an empty crock pot!

Really liked this recipe. I did alter it slightly based on other suggestions and what I had on hand. I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and a 5.5 oz can of tomato paste as my base. For the beans I opted for 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of chickpeas. I also added a small can of corn. Everything else was followed according to the recipe. Served with sour cream and sliced avocado. Will definitely make this again!

love this recipe!   really hits the spot on a cold day.  I cook the ground meat and drain.   After that I put in my slow cooker on low for a couple of hours.

As far as flavor goes, this recipe is tops! However, I like my chili a little bit thicker than this recipe.  So, I'm going to read through these other reviews and see how others suggest thickening it up.

My family loves this chili--great flavor and freezes well. For those that don't like anything "spicy" they may not like the amount of chili put in this one or the cayenne.

Combining the ingredients and putting in a crockpot on low for about 4 hours works well, along with the published method. 

It's delicious!

Am I the one who thought this was way too spicy? I thought a 1/4 cup of chili powder was a lot but I read other reviews saying it was 4/10 for spicy.  My whole family thought it was too spicy. Otherwise it was pretty good.

I used 2- 28 ounce cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and tomato sauce, but otherwise I used similar seasonings. It turned out great; I also got rave reviews from my guests.

I followed the recipe as written. The chili tasted great, though a little too salty. I would recommend buying low-sodium ingredients instead of regular.

I grew up with my mom making chili almost the same as this.  the only difference is that she added 1/4sq unsweetened bakers chocolate.  I still make it the same to this day, and I am 65.  My family loves it.

I can’t say enough great things about this recipe. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve made it. I don’t think I’ve made it exactly the same way each time and it’s turned out delicious every time due to the ingredients I have on hand. I’ve received tons of complaints and my toddlers gobble it up. It freezes great. I always double or triple the recipe to share and freeze for later. We typically eat it over a bed of brown rice with a heaping handful of cheddar cheese.

I have made this for years.  I've had rave reviews and even won a chili cook-off with it.  The only things I change up is that I use V-8 instead of tomato juice, I usually use 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb spicy sausage and I add a small can of rotel to add a little more spice.  I like my chili more soupy so it's perfect for me, and anyone who has tasted it wants the recipe.

Turned out great! I used all the ingredients listed. I added a little more cayenne and 1 lb of thinly sliced steak. I sautéed the veggies a little and put all into a crockpot for about 4 hours on high. Very good and will be my go-to chili recipe from now on.

I cheat and use chili beans in a can. I skip the tomatoes, but use the spices as listed. It adds depth to the bought chili beans and is soooo good!

My kids LOVED this chili! I used all the same ingredients except I cut the recipe in half. I also chose to add the veggies to the beef while I was browning it with a dash of the seasonings. The rest of the seasonings I added straight to the tomato base while I was finishing browning the beef.

I love love this recipe. I have made this several times for my husbands work crew and EVERYONE raves over it. It's just the perfect blend of spice without leaving those out who don't eat spicy hot food. The flavor does the talking rather than extra heat.  I adjust to 50 servings and make it in table top roaster and let cook overnight, just I would in a crock pot. A big bag of cheese and some sour cream everyone is happy.

I have been making this chili for years. My trusty chili recipe that NEVER fails. I follow every part of this recipe but add two whole cans of both black and red kidney beans (drained), one can of corn kernel (drained), and sometimes a can of Rotel. This is a hit every single time. Thank you for sharing!!!

Great recipe, that is very easy! I did not have tomato juice, so I substituted the tomato sauce with 1 can of diced tomatoes. Also, I did NOT add the juice from the can of red beans. The consistency turned out wonderful, thick like a typical chili (or pasta sauce). LAST, I tripled the amount of cumin, chili powder, and cayenne pepper—because I like spice. Still didn’t turn out “spicy”, but it gave the chili a nice aroma and layered flavor.

Great go to recipe for a classic chili  con carne.  It’s got just the right  amount of bite and is nice and thick. I’ve saved this as my new standard for chili.

Honestly, the hype is real. I LOVED this. I don't like thick chili, so this was perfect unchanged. The only things I did were omit the cayenne simply because I thought I had some, but didn't. And cut the beans by 1/3 because I am NOT a chili/beans person normally. This was divine and I can't wait to make it again. I think I can lower the calories even more and I will eat this constantly!

2/4/19  Adjusted recipe for 5 servings, and used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce; no other changes.  Mine turned out like soup with very little ground beef nor beans, so I added a can of pinto beans then used a potato masher.  It's thicker but I  prefer "It's Chili By George."  Don't know why, as that has the same ingredients as "Flatlander."

My husband and I tend to disagree on chili, but we both loved this! I didn’t have celery or red pepper and I used a little less spice because I’m not used to spicy foods, but this is definitely a keeper!

I made the recipe almost as stated. I used homemade tomato sauce (despise grocery store sauce), more cayenne and splash of beer at the last moment. 

I would use less tomato juice and tomato sauce, more spices to thicken it up more and heighten the flavors more. I did not simmer the chili for 1.5 hrs,  perhaps that makes it  thicker.  Too hungry to wait. ha!

Even tho I live in the mountains, I needed something easy, fast and tasty that would work even for a camp out. This fits on all counts. Only thing I changed was no oregano(I was out) and less chili powder. It was PERFECT and is now in my repertoire. Thanks!

I followed the recipe except I cooked the onions with the hamburger, then threw it all in the crockpot.  Since I was making this for  additional family members I wanted to add more stuff!   I added 3 cans of beans (1 black, 1 chili bean and 1 kidney).  I also swapped out the tomato juice for Rotelo diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Oh I added a diced jalapeno.  Everyone loved it.  Even my daughter who doesn't care about chili.  This will be my go to.

One of my favorite recipes. Adapted to the instant pot this time   20 minutes on steam with full natural release. Then I slow cooker  until dinner. Really no advantage for instant pot unless the beans were a little softer. It needs time to absorb the flavors.

I make this chili pretty much according to the recipe (unless short on an ingredient). My family loves it, and have been asked for the recipe when bringing it to pot-lucks. Can easily add to the recipe if you want more spice, more veggies, etc. My husband likes noodles in his chili, and I like to add fresh onion and a dollop of sour cream.

I made half the recipe and used real garlic cloves instead of the powder.  No tomato juice, just sauce and diced tomatoes.
I also sauted the onion, garlic, celery and green pepper in olive oil and added it to the mixture after I browned the beef.

One of the best chili flavors I have ever had.  Soupier than I prefer.  Used a slotted spoon to serve it to drain out some of the liquid.  The result was a chili with much better consistency.

No changes made. It was a little soupy and a bit too much tomato flavor. I prefer a more bean heavy chili.

This is a GREAT chili recipe...without changing anything!  Very flavorful, and quick. Please don’t add or delete things till you make it as is for the first time...it’s very good. (If you want more heat, add Red Hot to your bowl after you’ve tried it.). I did add a whole green pepper and two cans of beans simply because I didn’t want partials sitting around (and we like beans), but I didn’t change any seasonings or add anything that wasn’t already in it. Family liked it, too.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was delicious and super easy to make.  Pretty much made as is, but with less tomato juice and added homegrown tomatoes. Served with sour cream and cheese was perfect.

I made this with lean ground turkey, and I used 2 red bell peppers, in addition to 1 green bell pepper.  I also added an extra can of kidney beans (about 4 cups total).  I used a full bottle of tomato juice (extra 12 oz or so), added some chopped garlic in addition to the garlic powder. I like spicy chili, so I also added one large jalapeno (finely diced).  Wow, so delicious.  I will be making this again.

I was looking for a recipe similar to Wendy’s chili.  This is soooo close.  I have been making this chili for a couple of years now.  We love it.  If my husband is working out of town, I make it as is (my personal favorite).  If he is is home, I leave out the peppers because he does not like them.  Perfect chili for a cold day, tailgate, pot luck or just because!

This chili was a wonderful dish! My relatives came to visit and we made this chili- they loved it!! The only thing i would say was that 3 cans of tomato sauce made it a bit on the liquid side. Other than that, it was vey yummy! Thanks!

It's a great, simple chili recipe that I made the first time by the recipe and we liked it a lot, but this time, I did not have tomato juice or sauce on hand so I substituted four  14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes that I blended into juice. I also added a half a can of water to the pot along with the "tomato juice". I also increased the veggies to I cup each of pepper, celery and onion and added five cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder.  Fantastic!

There are as many chili recipes as there are people in the world. So you can't please everyone...right? Well, this didn't please me, my family or my friends. It was more like ground beef and bean soup!  Next time I'll leave out the tomato juice and just substitute 2 cans of diced tomatoes with their juice. I will also add 1 can of tomato paste and another can of beans. Well, actually, I might as well find a different recipe, instead of trying to make so many changes with this one.  I swung with this recipe and struck out. Thanks anyway!

First time making this chili and served it to company.  I was a bit nervous as I usually don’t use a recipe for chili but as I was serving it to friend thought I’d try it.  They all LOVED it and wanted my recipe.  Of course I forwarded it on.

This is my favorite recipe for chili,but I did make a few changes. Since I didn’t have tomato juice, I used tomato sauce and chicken broth. Also, instead of two cans of red beans, I add 1 can of seasoned red beans,1 can of seasoned black beans, and 1 can of garbanzo or cannellini beans. My family loves it! It’s delicious!

I found this to be a great chili recipe.  However, I could not help putting my own touches on it.  I replaced the tomato sauce with Classico Spicy Red Pepper Spaghetti Sauce.  I also replaced the tomato juice with a can of diced tomato.  I found that this made the chili thicker, which is what I wanted.  Enjoy

This was yummy!  But I did make a *few* alterations. Instead of ground beef, I used a whole rack of buffalo meat. I didn't have any tomato juice or sauce on hand, so I substituted a '94 merlot. As far as veggies, all I had on hand were leeks and butternut squash, so in they went! I did use the 2 cups of red beans! For spices I just used a cup of sugar and a 1/2 cup of pumpkin spice. I love your recipe! With the few alterations I made, it came out 5-star!! =)

This recipe is really good as is! Flavorful and rich. I thought it a bit odd that everything was just thrown in a pot and boiled. So I cut up 4-6 slices of bacon and fried it in the pot until it was crispy. I removed it with a slotted soon to a paper towel lined plate to drain so I could use it for garnish later.  In the bacon grease I sautéed the onions, celery and peppers for about 10-15 to develop some extra flavor then proceeded with the recipe as instructed (all ingredients in the pot...). I think this additional step provided some extra depth of flavor to the vegetables. Turned out amazing!

Fantastic chili!  My only changes were using two 28oz cans of diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato paste (adding about 5 or 6 cans of water) and doubling up on the cayenne pepper, as we like it spicy.   I put it in the crockpot on high for about 3 hours, then added 1 can kidney, 1 can mixed beans  (drained and rinsed). Cooked for another 1.5 to 2 hours.

Thank you, no need to look for another chili recipe ever again :)

It took me a long time to find a chili recipe that had good reviews from people who HADN’T changed or added a bunch of stuff. This recipe is so good! The only thing I didn’t add was green pepper because I didn’t have any and we’re not big fans of them in our house anyway.

This is such a good classic chili recipe, comfort food at it's best.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I used a red pepper instead of green pepper, fresh garlic instead of powder, and I also added in a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I would definitely make this recipe again!

This chili is savory and so delicious. I recommend using one LB ground beef and one LB mild Italian sausage for a bit more flavor.  I also added two tablespoons diced jalepenos for just a bit of heat. 
Highly recommended!!

This is a recipe, as is, my entire family loves, and this doesn’t take me 2 hours to make! Seasonings are perfect! It is a thin chili as made. The 2nd time I made it, I used 1 lb ground turkey & 1lb hot ground sausage as it’s all I had on hand. Cooked it in a skillet then drained the fat. I added 1-2 Tbsp of Worcester  sauce,  the onions, celery, spices to sauté. Put it all in a crockpot& substituted 2 -14oz cans chopped fire roasted tomatoes for the sauce. Added 1 can beans only & 1-4oz can diced green Chile’s. I added tomato sauce and tomato juice until I liked the consistency. I was not sold this was going to work, but after 6 hours in the crock pot on low-it turned out great.

I changed the tomato juice to tomato paste (so I could get the taste without so much liquid) and tomato sauce to diced tomatoe (so I could still have volume) then cut the cayenne pepper to half of what is called for (we don't eat a lot of hot stuff in my house). This is by far the best chili I have ever made and this is backed up by my family! This will be the only chili I make from now on!!!

Best chili I’ve ever made but I had to make changes...  used a 24 oz jar of tomato sauce, two small cans of tomato juice, 2 cans of diced tomatoes with mild chili’s, I used ground chicken instead of beef.  One can each of black beans, garbanzo beans and pinto beans, half bag of frozen corn and I simmered on low for three hours. Added my bell pepper and onion about 90 minutes before I served it so they would have a little more bite.  I served it with cheese, sour cream and cornbread.  Everyone said it was the best chili ever!!!!  Made it for the eagles championship game!!!  Now I’ll have to make it for the super bowl!!!!!!

I've never made chili without using a seasoning packet (*hangs head in shame) but from now on I will use this recipe!  The flavor was outstanding and I had everything on hand including cumin which I never how to use!   I did add some brown rice, though.  My  daughter is a swimmer and needed to carb-load before her meet .

This recipe was really good. I made it exactly how the recipe called for but maybe a few more onions. It can use a little bit of space and so afterwards when you dish it up. But otherwise perfect.

Love this recipe.  Tried like five or six other chilies before this and once we made this one we haven’t gone back to the others. Only real change I made was to use some diced tomatoes in place of a bit of the sauce and juice.  We like chili a bit chunkier :)

I made it and pretty much followed the recipe. I didn’t have tomato juice, so I used diced & stewed tomatoes instead. I also added more beans and a small can of diced green chiles. It turned out amazing!

this is a great chili, easy to make and delicious! my husband gives it two thumbs-up! great as a base chili to change up as well, not too spicy so spice can be added, not too sweet so sweetness can be added. i prefer a mild chili so this is perfect.

I have made this recipe now 32 times!! Once in Italy, for my daughters friends while they studied abroad and needed a little taste of home and 31 times with my students who are in my cooking class. I altered it only a little... added crushed Toms with chipotle or green chili and used tomato sauce and not tomato juice. If need be we add broth. Seriously easy and delightfully yummy. Always a crowd pleaser!!!

Love this recipe, as is. It takes me about 30 minutes to prepare (a double recipe), and about 30 minutes to bring to a boil and then I simmer for the full 1.5 hours.  I serve with chopped raw white onion, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream on the top, along with buttered bread.  I make this recipe 3-4x per winter, and vacuum seal and freeze what's not eaten within the first few days.  Perfect!

I made this chili for a chili cook off at work and won first place.  I used the advice of other reviewers and substituted tomato sauce for the tomato juice and canned tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  I also added 1/4 cup of corn meal to thicken it up.  It was a hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it and my family loved it, had seconds and barely any leftovers.  I took a suggestion to add 1 large can of tomato sauce and 1 can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice and added some corn meal to thicken the sauce.  I had to cut down on spiciness because my kids cannot handle that much.  Also, I made the chilli in a Dutch Oven, I'm sure it doesn't affect the taste. Loved this recipe, big thanks to the creator and all suggestions from reviewers.

I've been making another chili recipe on here for a while, which is great, but decided to give this a try. The ingredients were somewhat similar in that recipe. The only changes I made with this were the addition of two 15oz cans of stewed tomatoes and I cut back on the tomato juice just a little bit. I also put my seasonings in after the meat browned and gave them some time to cook/toast up. I then deglazed with a little bit of beer and added the tomato sauce, juice, and stewed tomatoes. Simmered for an hour and a half and this was great! Also, I didn't measure the beans. I used one 15oz can of small red kidney beans at the beginning. I then added a 15oz can of Brooks Hot Chili Beans during the last 20min or so. The addition of extra beans, as well as the stewed tomatoes, made this the perfect consistency for me.

I am a VERY picky person about chili. I generally don’t like it unless on a hot dog with out the beans. Curtain ones I don’t like (especially kidney beans). But this...this was GREAT! I followed the instructions. But instead of cooking on the stove. I cooked and drained the meat and put it all together in the slow cooker. Had it set on high for 4 to 5 hours. My boyfriend and his son who is 7 and can be picky at times also likes it. I’m sure I’ll be making this again.

Subbed 2 cans diced tomatoes for tomato juice and half can of beer.  Sprinkle of brown sugar.  Spices are spot on.  This will be our go-to chili.

This is an absolutely amazing recipe! I add two cans to thicken it up some of the beans and let it thicken up some. I also add a bit more cayenne so it burns both holes! Delicious!!!! Won first place with this recipe at an office chili cook off

Great pot of chili this recipe makes. If you're on the edge about making this recipe or another, look no further. A couple changes I made: 
I added 2 jalapeños which added a nice kick, and used a bit more cayenne for the same effect. Overall a great dish, will be making it again

This was fantastic! The only thing I altered was to add 2 cups of corn to give it little sweetness with the heat. This has ruined canned chili for me now and that is a great thing.
**Update** I just took this to a family gathering and got rave reviews for it. I had people coming up to me to ask for the recipe and saying that it was the best chili they have ever had. This is a fantastic recipe and can be an amazing base for customization!

This has been my go to chili recipe for about a decade now.  The recipe, as stands, is amazing;  if I am cooking just for myself, I like to add a jalapeno and/or serrano pepper for extra heat.

Only change was subbing chipotle chili powder for cayenne pepper because we love smokiness.  Loved it, thank you!

Loved this recipe! The only changes I made was to substitute more beans in place of 1 lb. of meat. I used a total of 3 cans of beans: dark kidney beans, black beans, and great northern beans. I also used the entire green pepper instead of a 1/4 cup but that was by mistake (a good mistake though :).

I let this sit in the crockpot for a few hours and it worked. Tasted better the second day! Husband is fussy about chili and he liked this version for a change.

My first experiment making chili and I loved this recipe. My only change was the addition of 1 small can of tomato paste.  Everyone in the family loved it. I highly recommend this chili recipe

This is a great chili that can be altered easily to suit your needs.  The first time I made it, I made it ahead of time and put it in the freezer to take camping.  It froze nicely and tasted great with cheese and cornbread.  The second time I made it I added 2 cocoa squares and cinnamon and less tomato juice to create a Cincinnati chili to serve over pasta.  I also made a vegetarian version using vegetarian 'meat' bits instead of the ground beef and it was a hit as well.

Great recipe! Followed it as it is and came out great! Well I added mushrooms, which I don't think it will change the flavor that much. So I really liked it!

So I used onion powder and instead of peppers and celery added baby spinach and omg this turned out so well! I thought it would be really acidic and sweet with the tomato juice and sauce but after adding everything else with blended so nicely and it was sooo easy to make! I think next time I'll add a few grape or cherry tomatoes. Yum yum!

A great basic chili recipe. Easy to make just about any variation and have it still come out as a tasty crowd-pleaser! Whether you're replacing the liquids for different broths, tomato juice, or water, it still comes out great.

My wife was disappointed when I didn't make her favorite "out-of-the-box" cornbread she was expecting. I made this recipe with the only change being that I added 1can of cream corn. Baked at 350 for 55 minutes. She was "blown away" and wants this awesome cornbread again!

I have made this recipe exactly as written many times.  It is the perfect level of spice, heat and flavor.  My family loves this recipe for chili.  Sometimes I will add a can of diced tomatoes.  In the past when I would make chili it would be very inconsistent, sometimes great sometimes too spicy or blah.  It's great to have a  fast and easy chili recipe that's great every time!  Thanks

This chilli is delicious!!! I followed other reviewers advice and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice. I used fresh garlic and browned the ground beef with some Worcestershire sauce. I also cut the chilli powder in half because I don't like too spicy. Great recipe

Great chili.  I used this recipe to make my first batch of chili ever.  I entered it into the chili cookoff at my job and won first place!  It has a great taste, consistancy and just enough spice to wake up your tastebuds, but not burn you down.

My husband LOVED it! We didn't have tomato juice so I used tomato paste and water.  I threw it in the crockpot so we could leave it unmanned while we took a walk. Flexible recipe. Easy and yummy.

I don't do many reviews online, but this one had to be written! I have been searching for a good chili recipe and when I read the spices in this one, I knew it was going to be special. I made it last night for our family which usually has 2 teenage boys, my husband and I, but last night we had an extra 2 teenagers. This recipe made a huge pot of chili and was without a doubt the best chili I have ever tasted. My family raved about it. Kudos to the chef because the spices are perfection. The only things I did was add a third pound of meat to give it a little more body and then added a little extra sugar to suit our taste. I also used pinto beans and because my boys aren't crazy about beans, I mashed up one can and mixed it in (which thickened the soup) and then only 1 can of beans was visible:-) It's a wonderful recipe and will be my permanent go-to for chili in the future. It's just delicious!

We really enjoyed this. My brother can't handle cayenne so I used ancho chili powder instead- about a half tsp.  Thought it was a tad too soupy and a quarter cup of masa flour fixed that.  I had 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage to us up so I added that to the 2lbs of beef.   I'm sticking  with this recipe, it's delicious and you can alter it to your personal taste. Thanks for posting!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, used more veggies than called for, added a can of retried beans, a couple of chipotle chilies and their juice, and about a quarter cup of red wine. Took it on a ski trip to serve to kids from 10 to 50 years old and everyone gobbled it up. Served with cornbread.

Great chili recipe that I plan on making again and again.  I cut back on the amount of beans and added jalapeno pepper instead of chili pepper.  I almost omitted the celery too but threw it in anyways and everything turned out exceptional.

Just perfect! I did appreciate Nikko26 suggestion to add a little cornmeal to thicken it a bit. Thanks George-this will be my new go to chili recipe. It was a big hit!

Great consistency but too much tomato flavor for me.  I will make this again with some adjustments.

I replaced the 46 ounces of tomatoe juice with (1) 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes & a 1/2 cup water. I also added (1) can of chili beans with the (2) cans of dark red kidney beans. I simmered the chili  for 1 1/2 hours. Once done the consistency was perfect. Not to thick & not to liquidy. Melted some taco cheese on top, added some sour cream & corn bread. Walla my husband actually commented how great it was!! That's how I know is was good. This is my go to chili recipe from now on.

The easiest and by far one of the best chili's I have ever tasted. It makes a very hearty meal.  Sometimes, I reduce the tomato juice and add a can of diced tomatoes.

I made it with  few alterations but this recipe is exactly what I was looking for. I needed to know a combination of spices and I used everything but the oregano & cayenne pepper (mainly because I didn't have it)  I also added a little flour to the cooked down ground beef to add substance to it. I added a can of Hunts Fire Roasted canned tomatoes and a can and a half of water. Perfecto.

As many others stated I used diced tomatoes while making.   Otherwise I followed the recipe, my hubby and son loved it.   Consider doubling the recipe to freeze.

I made it exactly as written. This is by far their easiest chili I've ever made and it turned out great!  I used a New Mexico chili powder blend and I think that helped give it good chili flavor without being really hot.

Wonderful recipe! The only changes I made were things I cannot or do not eat...the sugar and the beans. I used diced tomatoes and some broth in place of the juice because that's what I had on hand.

We made this recipe EXACTLY as directed, and it was wonderful! Absolutely the best chili we've made at home in a very long time. My husband prefers spicier chili while I'm more of a cincinatti style chili lover. This one was a great compromise and we both loved it! We will definitely be making this one again and again!

One of the best recipes for chili I've ever made - very similar to what my mom used to make.  Didn't change a thing.  When I make it for others they sometimes like it a bit hotter so I add a bit more cayenne -- that's it!

Loved this and let me start by saying as a new cook and a skittish cook when it comes to modifying, I DID change a few tiny things based on lots of the reviews. Simple stuff -- instead of 46 ounces of tomato juice, I did 32 ounces (4 cups) and one 14 ounce can of chopped tomatoes with mild green chilis. I did a whole brown onion, a whole green pepper and prob double the celery. One last thing -- instead of 1/2 cup of chili powder I did 3/4 cup (I know, so wild of me lol). That's it! Super low flame, stirred occasionally, turned off the heat after about 1 hr 10 mins (hungry!). Perfection!!! And a nice kick :)

I was told "don't change a thing, best chili ever". I agree. But I will add another tablespoon of chili powder next time, just to pump up the heat a bit. Otherwise, perfect!

It was really good. I used creamy tomato soup instead of tomato juice and I used my crockpot to let everything simmer after I browned the meat and veggies. I will definitely make it again! I can't wait to try it the day after, when the seasonings really go through.

Best chili I've ever made.... I can't handle a lot of spice, so I started with only 1/8 cup of chili, and that was plenty for me and my family.  My husband has requested I make it again!

I made this for a chili contest at work and it won! What I liked about this recipe is there are no chunks of tomato (I do not like tomato chunks or crushed tomato).  I followed the recipe but added smoked paprika, two diced habanero peppers, and a bottle of pale ale.  I don't like spicy food but I knew that most of my co-workers do, so this is the recipe I went with.  When I make this for myself I will not add the peppers and may add some spaghetti noodles.

After reading other reviews that this wasn't as spicy as they would have liked, I substituted the bell pepper for Anaheim pepper and added 1 seeded and diced jalapeño. I also added 1/4 cup cornmeal to thicken it up a bit. I cooked this in the slow cooker for about 3.5 hours on high and it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a new chili recipe and I have definitely found it. It was delicious and hubby thought so, too, and he is a tough critic. On the favorite list for sure.

This is a great chili recipe.  We added a can of fire roasted tomatoes because we like tomatoes in our chili.  We also cooked the onions, green pepper, and celery with the beef but only because my husband was putting it in a crock pot for a chili contest and ran out of time.

I have made this chili recipe several times and it has turned out amazing every time. I did make a few modifications after making it as it the first time though. My family is not of fan of green peppers in chili so I left those out and I also omitted the celery. I did add a bottle of beer and this really made the sauce taste outstanding. I also added more chili powder and cayenne pepper than the recipe called for as we like it a little more spicy. Happy cooking as this recipe is a keeper!

I added brown sugar instead of white sugar and then put in Worcestershire sauce in to taste. It is a smoky and tasty chili that gets better as it simmers longer

It is still simmering and tastes great already!  The aroma in the house is awesome.  I followed the recipe to a T however I ran out of oregano so I used an Italian spice mix.  I really smell the onions - I used Spanish onions.  Cannot wait for dinner!

Didn't think it would be that good because it seemed so basic but it was great! Added cooked elbow noodles, for my husband & to sell at concessions, and general public loved it! I also added extra water because I knew the pasta would suck up a little. Would totally make again!

Very yummy!  I had all day to let this summer and it turned out nice and thick.  If I only had the1-1.5 hours to simmer that the recipe called for, I think it would have been too runny.  The flavour was so good though.  Will be making it again!

Made this on the crock pot on high for 4 hours. I had made a few changes to the recipe using 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans. It had come out too liquidy so I added some flour. The flavor is great, would definitely make again! Yum yum!

This is a great chili recipe!  I used one pound of ground beef and three cans of beans...one red kidney, one black and one white navy.  I didn't have celery or green pepper but it was still delicious without it.  This is my go to chili recipe- and I always serve it over jasmine rice.  Yum!

I didn't have tomato juice so added 2 cans of tomato sauce and 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead.  Turned out lovely and I've had some real failures with other chili. As with most chili it was better the next day once the flavours had time to blend. Next time I may add a bit more heat though, maybe a little cayenne pepper, but not much.

So I've never made chili that didn't have a can of diced tomatoes in it.  So I added a 28oz can and used only a 14oz can of tomato sauce.  I also had some jalapeno peppers that needed to be used up so I chopped up two of them and added them.  I also added a bit more celery than was called for and just a pinch of cinnamon.  Otherwise everything else was the same.  Simmered it for more than 2 1/2 hours so it thickened up to chili-like consistency.  Maybe it's the chili powder we bought from the ethnic aisle at the grocery store but this chili was very HOT! Hubby liked it that way but if not for the sour cream and nacho chips to eat it with, I would not have been able to eat it.  However it was very tasty and this is probably the only way I'll make chili again.  I might have to cut back on the chili powder just a wee bit though.

This is a very good chili recipe.  I omitted the tomato juice and tomato sauce and replaced them with 28 oz. crushed tomatoes and 28 oz diced tomatoes. I omitted the green bell pepper and replaced it with 4 oz. Hatch green chilies.  This is amazingly good chili the next day! I am always asked to make this for any pot luck gathering!

Initially I was concerned about too much chili powder, however the seasonings were spot on.  Turned out great, a nice hearty comfort food kind of meal.  Not too spicy just very flavorful!  It's now on my favorites!

I was disappointed because this is a very tomato-y chili.  Which isn't for me. I prefer a beefy chili.

This was delicious!   Modified slightly to ingredients we had on hand.   Uesd stew meat instead of ground beef, omitted tomato juice, only had a can of pork and beans, 2 small cans of tomato sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes.  Simmered 1.5 hours.   Hubby loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading many positive reviews of this recipe I was excited to make this. I did exactly as the recipe  said but it was really really spicy. I could have known by adding a pretty  big amount of chili powder that it would be a bit spicy but this was way to spicy for us. Maybe we're not used to eating this spicy. I tried to tone it down by adding honey and lemon juice and some sour creme while serving but I didn't finish my plate. I'm going to add some more tomato sauce, beans, onions and groundbeef and the others spices except for the chili and cayenne to the left overs (which are a lot). Hopefully this will tone down the spiciness of the recipe. It smelled delicious though.
I reread the recipe to see if I did something wrong because I started doubting myself, but can't discover anything I did wrong.

You'll get great chili from this recipe, and it's five stars exactly as written. I've made it as written many times because it's a guaranteed hit. With that said, I sometimes enhance the recipe. I'll add a can or two of V8 and cook it longer (2-3 hours) to burn off that extra liquid. I'll also omit the added salt and add one beef bouillon cube, one can of diced tomotoes with green chilies, and two dashes of Tapatio hot sauce which will give it a low-medium heat. If time permits, make it the day before and reheat when ready to serve. Tastes even better next day.

I wish there were 10 ??'s!!! THEE BEST CHILI EVER!!! I followed the recipe as written the first time but this time I did swap out the tomato juice for sauce, the sauce for diced tomatoes(in juice,undrained), halved the salt and DOUBLED the green pepper.Makes the PERFECT meal when paired up with 'Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread' from this site. :)

My family isn't big on the spicy so I added chilli powder to taste and no cayenne pepper. Also we have to be careful of our salt intake so instead of tomato juice I added water. The whole family gobbled it up and went back for seconds. This makes a good amount of leftovers so I'm looking forward to having more later in the week.

I adapted this for my pressure cooker (instant pot) I threw everything into my pressure cooker and set in on manual for 30 minutes. I did use pre soaked dry beans and diced tomatoes and tomatoe sauce as substitutes. I also threw in a can of diced green chilies. When it was done I slow released 15 minutes and then added some frozen corn and let it bubble for about 5 minutes. I served it with shredded Mexican cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips and it was AMAZING. A one pot meal that was super fast.

I am so happy I did not review it the first time I made it because it would have receieved no stars.  The first time I swapped out a few items.  Instead of beef I used asparagus, instead of tomato juice I used pear juice (was on hand),  instead of tomato sauce I used a half empty beer I found on my neighbors porch a few days prior,  instead of onion I used avocado,  instead of celery I used green onion, instead of green pepper I used horchata, and as for the rest of the spices I changed all of them as well.  It was horrible.  After using the actual ingredients in the recipe I have to say it was outstanding.  Sure, you can tweak it to suit your tastes but if you want to rate a recipe, rate it, not a fabricated one.  Thank you, that is all.

No big deal.  Needed something more.......   I cup of  carrots, mushrooms and corn niblets.  Also added 1tsp each of paprika and  ancho chile powder. Tasted it after 2 hours and it still needed tweaking. Lime juice and 2 Tbls of Bbq sauce.  Then this became 5 stars.  This pot of chili was served reheated the following day.  Devoured by 8 men watching a hockey game. They thought it was amazing .

Love this blend of spices. Very like the store-bought seasoning packets, but better. We don't care for spicy foods so I leave out the cayenne. I also swap half the beef out for extra beans so it's cheaper and healthier.

Turned out awesome made it exactly as they said. I did change a few things, put in a red and green pepper and a lot less chili powder since my wife is hating on spicy. Also put in chicken instead of beef. Still was awesome had it while it's sick and it hit the spot. Recommend it to all.

Loved it!  Might add extra cayenne if you like it spicy, but it was perfect for my family. Delicious and made with things I generally have on hand (no hard-to-find spices or ingredients) which is a plus!

This was my first time ever making chili!  I would highly recommend this recipe it was very easy to make. I added three cloves of garlic and some cayenne pepper.  That's the only two things I changed and only because I like garlic and a little spicy. Fantastic!!!

Spicy but,  good flavor! First time I made this chili I followed the recipe but it was too hot for my family (myself, hubby and 80 year old parents). My dad thought it had a good flavor but needed to tone down the spices. When we had the leftovers, I added more beans and that helped. I'm making again tonight but cut the spices in half. Hoping for good results!

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: 1) Substituted V8 vegetable juice in place of tomato juice, 2) Used Italian seasoning in place of oregano, 3) Added several squirts of Frank's Hot Sauce, 4) I did not add any salt.
 I thought the chili was thin when I started to simmer it on the stove so I browned an extra pound of ground meat and added it in. That seemed to help the consistency. I would reconsider the amount of tomato juice otherwise.  Everyone liked it, you could definitely taste the flavor of the spices. I would make it again.

Great!  Super easy, and turned out perfect. We used 4 or 5 Roma tomatoes diced and a couple of 29 oz cans of tomato sauce instead of the juice and sauce recommended. Also added a minced chipotle pepper in adobo sauce for a just a little extra kick, it was a little too mild as is. Thinking next time of sautéing the onions a little first.....Wonderful dish!

Made this recipe for the first time two weeks ago and it was a huge success. I was mindful of the reviews that said it was too soupy by adding only about 2/3 of the tomato juice initially then gradually added more during the cooking until the consistency was right. For personal preference I used half as many beans and added one diced jalapeno for a little more heat. Definitely follows the chili principle where the longer you simmer the better! I froze the leftovers in ziploc bags and they reheat very well, maybe even better than the first time. I plan on making it again this weekend for the superbowl and I'm excited to have a bunch of easy leftovers again!

The taste is fantastic but the  recipe could be rated differently depending on your tastes.  My husband and son rated this a 5 plus since they love a chili with chunky, somewhat crispy vegetables with a more "brothy" base.  My daughter's and I like a thicker richer base with the veggies completely cooked down so rated this a 3.  That being said, I'm sure the recipe can be tweaked to personal preferences by sautéing the vegetables for awhile before and adding a roux to thicken the sauce.  Overall, quick, easy and very good

I made the recipe as it was published.  We loved it.  That was a couple of weeks ago.  I bought the ingredients yesterday to make it again!  It does make a lot of chili.

This is the only chili recipe I make and everyone that has tried it loves it. I don't change anything but I do leave the bottle of hot sauce out for anyone that likes it a little bit spicier.

Best chili ever! I didn't have enough tomato sauce and no juice so I subbed half of the sauce and the juice with a can of tomato paste and some water and it was still delicious! Spicy but not too spicy and nice and thick.

Rave reviews and many requests for this recipe from my tax training volunteers.  I ended up adding three times the tomatoes and beans (had extra large cans of them) when they came back for seconds and thirds.  Fed 12 people for $15.00.

I followed the recipe exactly even though I knew the tomato juice would make it very tomato based.  It was, but the spices are so perfectly paired.  I wanted something different than the way I always make it.  It was very good and I haven't been disappointed.  A great heat n'serve meal.

Delicious!! And very easy to make. I substituted the juice for tomato paste and the sauce for diced tomatoes because I wanted a "thicker" chili. It came out a little TOO pasty..next time I will reduce my paste and add some extra diced tomato's instead.,.seasoning perfect, even though it felt like I wasn't adding enough seasoning while I was making it.

So far it is a great hit.  Sub some crushed tomatoes (28oz can) and diced tomatoes (also 28 oz) can, with a small can of tomato paste as well.  Also added HOT green chilies (small 6 oz can).  Love it.  Thank you for the recipe, and all the recommendations.  Great base recipe for each family to tailor to their own needs.

Made this before and I liked it. Did make a couple of changes. I used 1 pound of mild Italian sausage and 1 pound ground beef. Also I added all the seasoning to the meat as I browned it. I served the chili on a be of spaghetti, topped with cheese and onions, with jalapeño cornbread on the side. My 9 year old wolfed it down.

It's a really good chili. I do most of my cooking using an instant pot and this recipe worked real well. I used about 24 oz of beans because I like a thicker chili. Thank you to the author

Great recipe.  Just the right amount of kick!Followed recipe closely, added a can of Rotel, and additional 3 cups of red kidney beans. I will try the corn meal suggestion next time. I served the chili with corn muffins.  I will be making this recipe several times this winter.  Overall, Yummy!

Very good! I added some minced garlic, substituted spicy V8 for the tomato juice and added a healthy dose of seasoning salt. Can't wait to try it on day 2.

Excellent chili.  I have made this a few times.  Lately I have been substituting a large can of crushed tomatoes plus some water for the juice to thicken it up a bit.  Also, I add a jalapeno and a Serrano to make it super spicy.

Very yummy!! I stayed true to the recipe except I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also added 1/4 c of cornmeal at the end as another reviewer suggested and it made for a great textured, thick chili!! The spice is just perfect for a large crowd!! I think next time I will sauté veggies for a few min before adding them to chili, I felt they were a bit too crunchy for our taste! But overall, this will replace my old chili recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I added stew beef cut small, cut back on the onion (not a big fan) increased the celery. Threw it in the crock pot and I loved the results. I will be sticking to this recipe when I want chili from now on.

Used only 1 lb of hamburger, but added another can of beans; 2 black, 1 kidney. Also, increased the Cayenne to 1/2 tsp, but my wimp wife complained it was too hot!

Making my second batch now, my entire family loved it and they grew up in white meats. Personal additions: beef bouillon and addition spices to taste when cooking the meat. 

Personal bowl touches: Sour cream and hot sauce after for a creamy and cool with a kick combo

This was soo good!  We loved it but it was way too spicy so I added only half tsp chili powder the next time I made it.  I also used fresh minced garlic, 1 tsp sugar, and omitted the cayenne pepper.

I didn't have everything exact but made due w tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes w some water. I added  a whole jalapeño and some beef stock along w dried basil for some additional flavor. It's delicious!!  I'm not the chili eater but my husband is and the kids like it also. So it's a nice addition to the repertoire of regular meals that I normally make.

I couldn't help but change it up to how I like my chili but I kept the spices the same and it was perfect. I like to add some ranch beans and Rotel instead of juice.

This is my staple chili recipe! Like many others, I have made this recipe EXACTLY as listed, but personal preference is the essence of cooking. That being said, the only subtle changes are: substitute a can of black beans for a can of red beans and add 1/4 cup of corn starch for thickness. Soooooo good! Thank you for contributing this recipe! When the cool North wind blows, and the air is damp with the smell of Autumn, my mind transverses to the place of good homecooked meals like this!

I have made this a number of times.  It is a good reliable chili for dinner that isn't so fancy that it takes a long time.  I play around with it in terms of tomatoes, often I omit the green peppers or put in the fire roasted peppers... I haven't been able to mess it up yet.  Works well with quesadillas, tortilla chips, corn bread etc.

I decided to give this chili recipe a try since I wasn't happy with our family chili recipe and had tried several to replace it.  It was awesome.  When reviewer Jeff said he could eat this until his stomach burst, I thought, "Yeah, right!"  He was so on target.  This recipe is so good.  It has now replaced 'the old family chili recipe.'

Flatlander Chili Haiku: "It's a mystery. Same as 'It's Chili by George!!!' with little changes." Made this a few weeks ago w/o noticing it being near identical to another AR chili recipe that I've already had. Oh well. This was good, not outstanding. Would make it again w/o the tomato juice; just too liquidy for my taste.

Husband really liked this chili.  I would have liked it a little spicier, but I went easy because he and the kid don't like spicy.  I always choose the lower sodium option when getting ingredients.  I screwed up and didn't have the tomato juice.  Thought about putting in lower sodium V8, but decided to put in a small can of tomato paste and a carton of lower sodium beef broth instead.  Put in a little less than 1/4 cup chili powder, knowing I could add more later.  Used 3 cans lower sodium kidney beans, rinsed well.  I didn't add any salt.  Let it cook, and toward the end I tasted & made some adjustments.  Put in a bit of ancho chili powder (for a little smokiness), paprika, some more garlic powder, and some beef Better Than Bouillon.  Husband had three bowls, and had some for lunch today. ~~~ Thanks for sharing the recipe -- I'll probably make this one again!

This is a good, basic chili recipe.  It makes a ton of chili though.  It was more than a family of four could eat in a few days with the leftovers.

Best chili recipe (and I've tried quite a few).  I had to improvise with ingredients on hand:  16 oz tomato sauce, 8 oz can of seasoned diced tomatoes, and 1 can of Dr. Pepper (my husband drinks the stuff by the case). Everything else as listed.  I also premix all the dry herbs in a small bowl before adding to the main mixture.  I prepared it in my slow cooker and let's just say the batch  didn't make it till dinnertime.  After my boys caught a whiff aout 3 hours in, they were dishing themselves out bowls, and it was all gone before dinnertime.  Next time I'll double the batch. :)

Excellent. Picky children love it.  Very basic you can adjust it to your preference. My daughter who does not ask for recipes or home makes anything requested this recipe from me.

For a spur of the moment decision this came out great!  I tweaked it a little based on what I had handy, halving the recipe (I'm one person...I can't eat chili for 10 days..) and adding diced tomatoes with jalapanos in place of the tomato juice. I like my chili more solid than soupy :)  Used leftover frozen onions (didn't measure) and green peppers (didn't measure those either) and left out the celery because I didn't have any.  Came out great though--easy recipe to remember the next time I'm in the store and an older gentleman says "Today is football day!!" and I think to myself..hey...chili sounds good! :)

This very easy to make and it tasted great!  I cooked this in my crockpot - 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low.  The flavors merged beautifully.  I realized too late that I didn't have any cumin so I substituted 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground thyme - weird, I know, but it actually worked well.  My husband likes a very meaty chili, so I used almost 3 lbs meat, 2-48 oz cans crushed tomatoes and 1 can tomato paste.  For the beans, I followed another user's suggestion and did 1 can chili beans and 1 can kidney beans.  I have very happy with how it turned out - especially without cumin.  My husband was happy and ended up having 3 servings for dinner!  Oh, I did not think it was spicy at all.  A little warmth on the backend, so there is a lot of wiggle room for more heat options.

Just made this and would highly suggest it! So delicious! ! Only thing I did a little differently was put a small can of tomato paste to thicken it up a little and added just a bit more sugar :)

This was awesome!  Definitely recommend it.  For those who like it spicy, (I do), you will need to add more heat to it as it's about medium heat level.  Perfect for crowds as it's not spicy for the kids.  My 3 yr old loved it. We're looking forward to making chili cheese burgers with the left over chili.  Thanks for sharing this recipe! It was yummy!

Good recipe.  Because of the other reviews, I used 1 29 oz can of tomato sauce, 1 29 oz crushed tomatoes, and 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes.  I used 3 T chili powder instead of 1/4 cup. Thought it was a bit spicy, so next time I will use 2 T of chili powder.

I have used this recipe for a few years now and it is an excellent recipe. The only thing I change is that I use ground turkey instead of beef (and use only 1 lb) and 4 cans of various kinds of beans because I love beans. Otherwise I keep everything the same, love it!!! I also make it in the crock pot.

First time making chili. It was awesome!!! My boyfriend said it was the best chili he ever had. And he loves chili. I did use 2 1/2 pounds of ground turkey instead of the beef. I also  used 2-29oz cans of tomato sauce and 1-28oz can of diced tomato. I left out the tomato juice and celery.

I used brown sugar instead of white, and used bush's red chili beans in mild sauce in the place of red beans for the added flavor and it came out delicious! Five stars!

I make this for every occasion, it's fantastic. Around Halloween, I add a can of pumpkin purée and a few dashes of pumpkin spice, I've also added fresh mango to create a mango chili for a luau. No matter what I do, it comes out fantastic. I HIGHLY recommend it, everyone begs me for my recipe!

This was my first time making chilli and it was a success. Both my boyfriend and his roommate kept commenting on how good it was. We poured it over Fritos and added some cheese and it was delicious! At first I thought it would be too liquidy but it thickened up once we put it in out bowls. I did do things a little differently- I almost doubled the beans by adding two 15oz cans of red beans due to my fear of it being too watery and it  worked out great. My boyfriend normally hates beans but he still loved it. I also cooked everything on the stove for the first 15-20 minutes and then transferred it to a crockpot on high for the next 2 hours. Worked out so I am happy! When everyone is in a food coma after eating your meal, you know you did something right ??

I love this recipe!! It gives me the start to a basic chili recipe. I do mine in the crock pot for about 8 hrs on low. I use 3 lbs of ground beef or if I feel like splurging, we use buffalo burger!! I add in 2 28oz. cans of tomato sauce, 3 cans of fire roasted tomatoes and jalepenos fresh from the garden. I don't like beans, so I omit them & it still tastes amazing!! I even entered it in a cook off & it didn't win, but everyone complimented me.

This is my "go to" chili recipe. It's a Wendy's type of chili. Just much better! Prepared as written first time. Excellent! (I now cut the cayenne pepper down a smidge...personal preference.) Thanks,  George!

This recipe is fantastic! So many people ask me to make this when I invite them over for dinner.  I didn't change a thing besides letting it simmer in a slow cooker on low for 4 hours rather than in a pot on the stove.

We used this recipe as the base for a veggie chili by using tvp instead of the beef and it turned out great.  A few changes included heaping and doubling the spices (minus salt and sugar) and adding extra beans.  Added extra veggies and used fresh garlic (2 cloves) in place of the garlic powder.  I know, significant changes, but the basic elements are in place in this recipe and the tomato bases were in good amounts and the directions simple.  Have saved the recipe and will do it again (maybe adding some canned/stew tomatoes).

Easy and super-good.  Like many others, I switched out tomato sauce for the tomato juice, and diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  Other than that, followed it to the letter.  Really, really good.  My husband had THREE servings last night, and then took the balance to work for lunch today.  A bonafide keeper and hit.  Thanks!

I make this chili about once a month. I love it as is (aside from the fact that I add way more cumin and cayenne pepper.) but it really adds to the flavor when I add chili beans instead of normal kidney beans. I also omit the celery.

This recipe is really good! I didn't have tomatoes juice or tomato sauce so I just used red beans and diced tomatoes I didn't drain the tomatoes but did drain the beans. I added a bullion beef cube as well but this did turn out awesome :)

I made this tonight. Used the website to adjust to use 1lb of beef (we are a family of 2) this is roughly half the recipe. I used 1 can of tomato sauce, and added water towards the middle of cooking to adjust the consistency as needed. I also used a can of pinto beans instead of red beans because thats what i had in the house. I served it on spaghetti with a spoonful of sour cream and some grated cheddar cheese. It was very very good and I am looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

I stupidly messed with the serving size- cut it in half and it wasn't nearly as good as it was when I made it using the correct measurements!! Won't be making that mistake again!

Best chili ever!! Im new to cooking so I was a little nervous on how it'd turn out and it was amaazing. I just add a little more cumin, chili powder and blended fresh tomatoes for the tomato juice as well, left it a little chunky. Yummmmy. Making another batch right now only half the size this time. :) and I NEVER write reviews so that alone makes a statement:) thanks a ton!

This is the easiest chili recipe I have ever tried.  It is also the best.  I have made if just the way it is written lots of times.  Always a hit.  Serve it with peppers, sour cream and cheese on the side for those who wish it.  My grands come over with their friends every time I make it.  Thanks for a favorite keeper recipe.

Made this recipe and used ground bison in place of beef. Also added half a pound of mild chorico sausage and bumped the cayenne pepper up to 1/2 Tsp. Amazing turn out. 5 stars.

I left out the tomato juice, I thought the sauce was enough tomato flavoring once it boiled. The chili turned out great! I used shredded mild cheddar cheese, sour cream, and chopped green onions for toppings. It definitely doesn't take a whole hour to simmer before it is ready to eat. I made a bowl after 20 minutes, but I stir fried the onions, green peppers, and celery before mixing all the ingredients so they were done before hand which saved some time.

I almost didn't review because, what's one more 5 star rating, right? BUT! It really is as good as they say. Make it as directed. Tweak to your heart's content. It will turn out splendid, no matter what you do. 
My family loves this one, from the 34 year old to the 5 year old. Only pizza gets more raves. ;)

I did enjoy this chilli. It was quick and easy with ingredients I generally have around the house. After a few goes, I decided to try something new. I followed the recipe with 3 changes that made a difference to me. I added an extra cup of beans (because I love beans). Then I added a tbsp of freshly ground coffee and a tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder. Now this chilli isn't just good. This chilli is killer!

I made it exactly as the recipe calls out the first time. It is a hearty chili with a small amount of heat. The second time I made it, I hollowed out one jalapeno and chopped it up finely and added it. It gave the chili some more flavor without adding a lot of extra heat, which satisfied a wide range of guests.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious! Don't worry about measuring the veggies exactly, I always put in whatever I have left over in the fridge and it's perfect every time.  The only substitution I make is instead of the cayenne pepper, I put in 1-2 jalapeño, deseeded and deveined.  I add back seeds depending on my audience.  I've made this different ways...as written and also browning and draining the meat then mixing all ingredients in the crockpot and leaving it on Low all day (6 hours).  Both were perfect and guests always asked for the recipe.

I made this for the first time this week and loved it. I never thought to add tomato juice. I omitted the celery and green onion and used almost the whole bottle V8 juice (46 oz). I also used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed. With all the added canned ingredients and V8, I thought I should only use a 1/2 of salt. It was still a little too salty for me. So the next time I make this, I'll omit the salt entirely.

I make one simular to this...I'd like for folks to try.Cook 1-2 lbs. ground beef,season it with onion powder & seasoning salt.Drain.Put in large pot,with tomato sauce(you choose how much)and 2 cans of pinto beans not drained.Add 1 lg. can of diced green chilli's,cumin and chilli powder.To make it spicier,I add a few good squirts of Franks Redhot sauce.We either eat in a bowl topped with shredded cheese,and crackers,or over cooked elbow noodles.Fast & easy,taste real good.(sometimes we use onions on top)

This is the best. Won one contest, and now onto the next. I changed a few ingredients to the recipe. Then did not use the tomato juice, added more beans. As I made it the night before the need, as putting in the refrigerator probably did help.
There were many including myself that wanted to have more then one helping.
 Used a small hot pepper to give it alittle boost.

This is a great chili recipe, but really lends itself to modifying it to your own preferences!!  I've made the recipe as it is...but have started to "play" with it a bit and now I like it even more.  I decrease tomato sauce to 8 oz and add 28 oz crushed tomato, 1 can tomato paste and 2 cups of beef broth. Add 28 oz drained diced tomatoes and use 1 can black beans and 1 can of kidney beans (both drained and rinsed).  To the seasonings I add 2 T more chili powder, 1 teaspoon of chipotle pepper and 1 extra teaspon of cumin.  So good...my hubby's favorite chili!!!!

Great recipe - easy and perfect seasoning. I used diced tomatoes instead of juice since that's what I had and added more beans. Thanks - this will be my go-to chili recipe!

I made this exactly as written and it was really good.  The next time I made it, I added more cayene (I like it hot) nd instead of the tomato juice, I used equivalent ounces of petite diced tomatoes.  I like it chunkier and that did the trick.  My family loves this and I make double batches and freeze it in individual servings to take to work.

Amazing. Add Franks red hot for a hotter chili, but I like my chili's mild this this recipe! I also added brown sugar instead of white sugar, and a touch of honey to sweeten it. AWESOME RECIPE! Thanks!

Modified recipe according to what I had on hand. Omitted tomato juice and large can tomato sauce.  Used 3 small (8oz) cans tomato sauce & 2 cans water instead.  Omitted celery & bell pepper. Used scant 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Used 2 cans pinto beans instead of red beans. It was perfect.  Will used modified recipe again.

This was so easy and surprisingly good for how simple it was! I halved the recipe and instead of white sugar I used agave, but other than that , I followed the recipe . Yum!

I made this for the first time, making a few changes following other reviewers.  I used tomato sauce and diced tomatos instead of the juice.  Everything else I followed exactly.  I would recommend if you are a bean lover, double the beans, as I thought they were quite sparse.  I will definately make this again, but with more beans.  I topped with cheese, sour cream, and chopped green onions.  It is SO GOOD!

I have made this a few times. As others have said, tomato sauce is all that's needed (rather than the tomato juice.) I also omit the bell peppers, as I dislike them. I half the cumin, as I feel its too much. I also double the cayenne, and its still fine for me (I don't like really spicy stuff.) This is overall a really good recipe.

We loved this recipe.  We used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice and then added the tomato juice slowly to thin it out to the consistency that we like it.  It was easy enough that my 7 year old son made it with very little supervision from his mother!  Thank you!

UPDATE: THIS WAS SOMEWHAT BETTER ON DAY 2. THE CHILI MELLOWED A BIT AND WASN'T NEARLY AS TOMATOEY (WHICH I DIDN'T CARE FOR). I TOPPED A LEFTOVER BAKED POTATO (HALF) WITH SOME CHILI, CHEESE, SOUR CREAM AND CHOPPED ONION. REMINDED ME OF WENDY'S FAMOUS BAKED POTATO! MMMMMM.... Neither my hubs or I cared for this at all (sorry!). We both felt this was way too tomatoe-y. Having said this, I'm not sure why we had such an aversion to this while we liked George's "It's Chili by George!!". While we didn't fall in love with that one (it would not be the first recipe I turn to when the chili mood strikes), we certainly didn't dislike it as much as we did this. Other than a few minor differences, the two really are pretty much the same recipe, so I'm stumped. :) Contrary to the norm, I followed George's directions to the letter for the most part. My only change was with the cooking method. I decided to slow cook my chili (9 hours on low setting) rather than cook it on the stovetop as directed. If you're looking for a highly-rated and EASY chili recipe, try Deb's blue ribbon chili or Danielle's slow cooker chili. Both are FANTASTIC and the stellar reviews are proof of that. Serving this "chili mac" style with all the fixins' MADE our meal (the chili certainly didn't...). Maybe this will float your boat, but it did nothing for us. Thanks anyways, George. :)

A fantastic recipe!! I took many other's advice and changed the tomato juice to tomato sauce and the tomato sauce to diced tomatoes. I also increased the chopped green pepper to 1/2 cup and changed the beans to 2 cups each of dark kidney beans and pinto beans (both drained and washed). I let this big delicious pot of chili simmer on the stove for 2 1/2 hours and it was one of the best foods I've ever had. Definitely going to make this again!

I used 1.4 lbs ground beef, 2 cans low sodium dark red kidney beans, small can tomato paste, can petite diced tomatoes, about 20 oz. tomato juice, 1/4 cup chili powder, 2 tbsp cumin, sugar, sprinkle of garlic powder, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and I added diced onions and green pepper.  It was delicious!  Mild, the way I like it.  Reminded me of Wendy's chili without the bite.

This was really great!  Im not that crazy about chili(must have had it too many times growing up!!) but i followed the recipe strictly, just threw all ingredients into crock-pot, and cooked on high for a few hours.  I also didnt use ground beef, i used ground deer chili meat.  The seasonings were perfect, we topped with some cheese and sour cream, the leftovers the next day we poured the chili over some fritos and made frito pie, and it was great, even the company loved it!

Delicious! My husband and I love this chili. I make it in a large crock pot by adding the cooked beef and all other ingredients in the crock pot and cooking it on low for 2+ hours. Only thing I didn't include was celery.

The sign of a good recipe is one that doesn't need a lot of tweaking. I've never put in the full amount of spice. My kids would never eat it if I did but we love it just the same. One of these days I'll separate out the batch and do an 'adult version'. I prefer to split the beans: half red and half black. No other revisions made.

Needed a chili recipe quick...I had most of the ingredients on hand for the Flatlander recipe and put it together quickly. It came out superb!! Served it with steamed jasmine rice and it was a homerun at the kitchen table!! Easy, fast and prepped in under 15 minutes. Did not add celery by mistake and added black and red beans for color. Also added my own canned tomatoes from the garden. In my recipe box for future chili nights :) It's a great base recipe to experiment with.

I have made this many, many times.  I adjust according to my taste as do most people, but a couple of things I add that I love are chipotle peppers with a little adobo and liquid smoke when I brown the meat.  Sooo yummy!!!

I started this recipe as a base but then ended up changing up the ingredients. I added a can of corn to it, minus'd the peppers, celery, and exchanged the onion with 1 Tbsp of minced onion. I also minus'd the red beans, added chili beans and kidney beans. I added Hunt's whole tomatoes and Rotel diced tomatoes and chilies. I used a 1/4 tsp of chili powder instead of 1/4 cup but wished I used a bit more. Thanks for giving me a start!

I would agree with others that this is some of the best chili I've had. It's also easy.  We switched out crushed tomatoes & diced tomatoes for the tomato juice & sauce as others suggested and also skipped the celery.  We did 1/2 kidney & 1/2 black beans and used real garlic instead of garlic powder.  Delish over a baked potato.

I am actually allergic to tomatoes so had to rely entirely on feedback from others. I served this with grilled cheese to 10 people after we did a pumpkin patch and corn maze. Huge hit! The pot was scraped clean. DH tasted for me all day and his advice is to let it simmer for several hours; otherwise it tastes too much like tomato juice.

I loved this chilli. I made it as written except for a pinch more cayenne pepper and about 5 large jalapenos sliced and mixed in. I brought it to work for a chilli contest and didn't place. However, my container was the only empty one and 3 people asked for the recipe. Lol. Go figure.

I made this recipe nearly as-is (only substituted ground turkey for ground beef) and it was okay.  It calls for A LOT of tomato juice and at first it looked like it was going to be chili soup, but after simmering for over an hour, it thickened up. At that point I wasn't hoping for anything great, just something edible, which it was.  I have other chili recipes that are much better.  

On a personal note, it gave me horrible heartburn.

I used ground turkey instead of beef and it still tasted great! I also used diced carrots instead of bell peppers to make sure I got all my veggies. I will make this again and again!

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  I followed the suggestions, and subbed tomato sauce for the juice, and diced tomatoes for the sauce.  I also used both kidney and black beans, but only because I had them both on hand.  The longer it cooks, the better it is - I can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and it was a little runny for my taste. Next time I'll use less tomato juice. Still great!

This chili is easy and taste amazing AS IS!! My husband, daughter, and I all LOVE this recipe!! I do sometimes soak dry beans (kidney, black, pinto; any kind) and cook them and then add them and it's equally delicious and even more nutritious. If you're so inclined you can even add rice to stretch the servings. Of course, like everything, top with cheese. Serve with tortilla chips. Delicious! Thanks, George for your recipe!

Awesome, Easy, Great Tasting Chili!
I used ground turkey rather than beef and a red pepper rather than a green pepper, simply all on hand. This recipe makes a very nice rich sauce!
Highly Recommend!

Delicious!! I have been making this recipe for a few years now. Over that course of time, I have tweaked it just a bit until I found the thickness that I was looking for. With the help of some reviewers, I too changed the tomato juice to tomato sauce and the sauce to diced tomato (I use diced tomato with green chile for a little heat.) I then use 3!! Yes, you read right, 3 cans of beans. I use one of pinto, one of kidney, and the last can is black beans. I take half of each can (with a little of the bean liquid) and blend it in a blender to make a thickening agent for the chili. Then I just add more veggies than what the recipe calls for because WHY NOT!! :-p Very yummy! No complaints from anyone.

My husband is nearly a chili connoisseur!  Chili is probably his favorite food ever.  So, I've made many, many different recipes, countless times.  I tried this recipe on a whim - and seriously, it's so wonderful!  A real truly delish chili, we have our on rice and it was just out of control perfect as is!  I changed things up a bit for us, but just barely and yeah - instead of going from recipe to recipe, htis is going to be one of our top go-to chilis :)

I made this today, I think it has a strong base but I found it to be a bit grainy for me, like I could still feel the grit of the spices, so next time I use this I will be sure to cook the spices a few minutes before I add everything else, that way they are melded together and that grit has a chance to cook out. But I will definitely use the base for this again.

This is the only chili recipe I use. Fantastic every time and stands up to tweaks if you like it more spicy or garlicky etc. I've started using crushed tomatoes lately instead of sauce and juice. No matter what you do this recipe it is fantastic. Keep it and never show your friends. They will think you are a chili champ.

This was my first attempt at chili, very easy & tasty! I added a can of (no salt added) corn to amp up the veggie value and substituted 99% fat free ground turkey in place of ground beef to knock down the fat. I didn't have a green pepper on hand but will definitely add that next time. YumYum!

Delicious.  I used 1lb of ground beef and 1lb of ground turkey.  I also, like other reviewers, substituted the tomato juice for tomato sauce and the tomato sauce for 1 can of rotel hot and one can of diced tomatoes.  The chili was perfect.

This was very good and pretty easy to make. I used Tomato paste and diced tomatoes and had to add water because it was so thick. I used 1 qt jar of black beans and would like to have more beans in it. It was very meaty with a few beans but a good flavor. Next time I'll probably use 2 qts. of beans.

I am married to a hunter. So I substituted the beef for venison.  I did half spicey and half regular which gave it a great kick and awsome flavor.  It was a HUGE hit at deer camp!!

Hubby made this the other day and it was FANTASTIC.  Hubby used ground chicken breast to lower the fat content and left OUT the sugar (we don't like sweet chili) and it turned out EXCELLENT. He did add a little chipotle seasoning, also for taste.  The only thing I think we may try next time is to add some crushed or canned tomatoes. Definitely not necessary, but would have been delish too! :)  Excellent recipe as is- THANKS! :)

REALLY GOOD FLAVOR, but it was a little on the thin side. Granted, I left out the beans, but I can't imagine they made that big a difference, especially considering I added macaroni.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  It turned out awesome, many of our guests said it was the best chili they'd ever had and I've passed on the recipe several times.  This has become my go-to chili recipe.  Enjoy!

The first time I ever made chili and it came out great! It was super simple to prep. I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in a big sauce pan. I was planning on making it as is but decided against it based in what I thought would be lower sodium. I wanted to use low sodium juice but didn't want to compromise flavor, which is the only reason I used others recommendations to do sauce instead of juice and tomatoes instead of sauce. I also added shredded carrots. Will definitely be making this all season long!

After reading reviews, I decided to sub the tomato juice with crush tomatoes.  I also added at 15oz can of stewed tomatoes and a beef bouillon cube (I got this from another chili recipe) .  I let this simmer for two hours and was quite pleased with the results.  This will be my standard chili recipe.

After trying many other chili recipes...this one finally met my fiance's approval.  He wants me to make it weekly!  I did listen to other peoples suggestions and substituted diced tomatoes for the tomato juice.  I made cornbread to go with it, and it was the perfect fall/winter Sunday meal!

this is definately the chili recipe I am going to keep in my recipe collection.  I used stewed tomatoes intead of tomato juice to add some texture. Plus I doubled the cayenne pepper since I was making it for a bunch of hunting guys. I also added some green pepper, but the basic recipe here is very, very good.

YUMMMMMMY! Really good spices. I substituted diced tom and tomato puree instead of tom. juice. IT WAS FABULOUS!!!  My first time making chili, it was very easy to prepare. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe. Perfect dish for creating smiles on a chilly night.

really good, found it a little to watery though. So in the last 1/2 hour of simmering i added 1 cup of minute white rice, and the it turned into more on a chili. i also didnt add the 1/4 cup of chili powder because i didnt have any. still was very tasty!

I followed the recipe to the dot.It was pretty good, although I like mine with corn and more beans.And also a little less runny, hubby added starch at the end to thicken it up.

I loved this!  I made a few alterations - I did not use the can of tomato juice, instead I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I also only used 2 tbsp + 1 tsp of chili powder b/c my husband doesn't like it to be too spicy.  I sauteed the veggies in EVOO before I added the rest of the ingredients.  The flavor of this was great!  I will definitely make this again!

I cooked this last week and it was a huge hit. I scaled it down and still froze some of it for a later date. However I did make changes. I sauted my onions and garlic in EVOO then threw in crockpot. I then browned my hamburger meat, drained, and put in crockpot. I used a vegetable juice instead of tomato juice and I chopped up about 4 Roma tomatoes and 1/4 of a jalapeno and sauted in EVOO. I cooked up some dried pinto beans to use instead of can beans. I did not make any chages to the seasonings. I put everything in the crockpot and cooked on high for about 3 hrs then turned to low for about 2 hrs. The leftovers were even better!! This is my new chili recipe.

I grew up in Texas and this chili deserves to win a cook-off blue ribbon.  THe flavors are well-balanced and satisfying.  I've made it several times with only one change -- I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice because I never manage to remember to buy tomato juice.  (It makes the sauce thick and savory anyway!)  I've also made it with extra garlic, an added can of diced mild chilis and even a palmful of grated sharp cheddar.  Yum.  This is a great staple chili recipe that doesn't disappoint.

This is the best chili I've ever made.  Great recipe!  I added 1/4 cup corn meal to thicken and used canned diced tomatoes instead of juice.  I also just put all the ingredients except for the meat (I used ground turkey) into the croc pot before going to bed.  I added the ground turkey in the morning and now I have lunch and dinner ready!  I topped it with homemade Guacamole and crumbled cornbread.  Delicious!

Delicious!  I'm eating my first bowl as I type.  I followed the ingredients religiously and it turned out just superb.  Now, I'm a vegetarian so I used a vegetable base meat substitute instead of the ground beef.  Also, I prepared it in a pressure cooker, saving about an hour of preparation and humidity in the kitchen.  The consistency is perfect.  Right now, I'm taking a bite after every sentence.  Tasty, tasty, tasty.....

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I did change it to my liking.  The recipe as written is a little to watery for me.  I like my chili chunky.  I do not use the tomato juice, I substitue diced tomatoes instead.  I also omit the celery only because I don't like it.  With that being said, this recipe is incredible!  I highly reccommend it.  The flavor I would give 5 stars!  I have made this several times and its always a huge hit!

I made as written, and it was very good.  I mostly tried it because my husband likes a meaty chili and I was looking for something for him.  Very good.  He kept getting a "taste" before it was done!

I made this for a block party and everyone loved it. Served it with the oyster crackers and taco shredded cheese. It was gone in minutes! I will be making this all through football season.

Changed it a bit, got rid of the tomato juice and just had tomato sauce and canned tomato's. We like our chili thick! This is my family's favorite chili and gets cooked quite often.

Fantastic! My fiance and I used canned whole tomatoes (and cut them up), and canned tomato chunks in addition to the can of sauce. Absolutely fantastic! The spices are spot on and my family loved it! We're making it again next week!

I found the perfect recipe.  Everyone that tried it ended up with a bowl, even the ones that didn't like my other chili.  Thanks, George!  P.S. This is a chili recipe for those who don't like it too hot or too whimpy.  It's perfect.

Yummy,yummy,yummy! Excellent flavor! I had to deal with what I had on hand though. I halved the recipe and still only had half of the tomato juice. I substituted with 2 fresh diced tomatoes. Accidently used twice the cayenne, but still enjoyed the result. Only had half of the chili powder, so I used some chili spices left over from a chili kit. This is the best chili I have ever made. Agreee with other reviewers disagreeing with modifying ingredients then panning the recipe. If I had disliked my results I wouldn't have posted. But this chili turned out great even with my substitutions.

Very good recipe!  I followed some other suggestions and replaced the tom. juice with crushed tomoatos and tom. sauce with diced toms.  I also added 3 cans of beans, one black, one chili and one red kidney.  Turned out great!  The rest I did as written.  My family loved it.  thanks

Really good! I didn't have green peppers so I used mushrooms instead; also, I used both kidney beans and black beans - turned out delicious, a little watery, but otherwise, very good flavour! :)

This is one of the best chili recipes we've found.  However, we turn down the hot level for the kiddos.  Our best addition was 1 lb sausage and 1 lb ground beef.  Otherwise, this is phenomenal as written.  Our family loves it!

I made this exactly like the recipe said but used 3 lbs of ground beef, so it was a pretty thick chili.  Terrific.  I thought it would just be okay, but it came out great!  Thanks!

This recipe comes out great is seems to please everyone in the group from those who don't like it too spicy to those who do.  Also, you can make this recipe with a meat alternative (Morningstar Ground "Beef") and even meat eaters who know that it's not real beef still like this chili.

Wonderful recipe. Thank you. Only change I made was that I cooked the onion along with the ground beef. No more store-bought chili mix!

This recipe was a huge success with both my husband and my kids. Believe me when I say that this is difficult to do! I thought that it was perfect and in order to make it good for all my family I took out a little bit of the spices for my kids who don't like spicy food and then added more seasoning to my husbands and my bowl. I think I will try adding the cornbread mix in like another person suggested to see if it betters the recipe.

I adore this chili! I usually substitute a large can of V8 for the tomato juice, and do one can of black beans and one can of red. Very forgiving and so easy to make in big batches! I doubled a batch to give some to a neighbor in the crock pot and they loved it.

LOVE this recipe, Have made this twice, but like some of the others I tweeked it a little to make it easier. Omit the tomato juice, Used 2 cans of the chopped tomatos, one can of the tomato sauce, used 1 whole onion and 2 stalks of celery, and 1 whole green pepper. The rest stays the same. Wow what a great chili, less measureing and easy to throw together, just have to measure out the spices.

Great chili. Also a great base to play around with. Was fairly acidic so next time I will try to bring that down. The key to a phenomenal chili is to not get heart burn after. Personal experience though. Recipe is great.

This was a very good chili recipe, but I think next time I would add some canned tomatoes and not so much tomato juice (I may not add any at all).  As it has been said though, this is an excellent base to expand on as you wish

I may be a chili novice, as I had never cooked it before, but this was a HIT!  I served for a football gathering/party to a bunch of chili-loving men and they said it was the best they've ever had! This recipe is super easy and low maintenance.  A+

Good stuff. I halved a couple of the spices, but I think it can definitely take the full amount of spices, and not be overpowering.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this Chili but we found it needed a bit more salt. I think it's because I used the "blue menu" Tomato juice and it contained less sodium. Still yummy.

This was good standard chili. I only had one pound of ground beef but added the same amount of spice in along with a big can (28oz) of chopped tom's (not drained) and no tomato juice from recipe and it tasted good. I might add some sausage next time. If you do this with 2 pounds of ground beef I would definitely add more of the spices!

Don't put in so much chili powder - very good, but it had a kick, before you could finish the bowl.  Used a can of tomato soup, added a can of mushrooms, 686ml can of pasta sauce, and 540ml can of tomato juice.

This recipes was awesome but I did make some modifications because I wanted to make it more healthy and lowfat.  I used the spices as stated except added an additional teaspoon of cumin.  I used only 1 lb. of ground beef.  Instead of tomato sauce I used 2 (15oz) cans of diced tomates, 1 with chili's one without.  Instead of tomato juice I used 1 large (28oz) can of crushed tomatoes. I omitted the celery and onion because of preference but used a total of 2 chopped green peppers.  For the beans I used 1 can of light red kidney, 1 can of dark red kidney, 1 can of pinto and 1 can of black beans. I did purchase 1 can of tomato sauce in cause it needed to be thinner but didn't need it. Awesome flavor with moderate spice.  The family loved it!!!

AWESOME!  I used ground turkey in place of beef.  I trippled the spices and used in place of tomatoe juice, 2 cans of diced tomatoes (undrained).  Really, really good recipe.

Lovely recipe. My husband is a big fan of mexican food and this recipe is very authentic.It's also quite spicy, so if somebody can't handle too much spice, you should cut down on the chili powder.

very good chili, and makes a lot too.  followed the suggestion to leave out the tomato juice, and to use a large can of diced tomatoes instead.  Also doubled up on the vegetables and cooked for about 4 hours, and had amusement park cornbread with it.

the chili is just right. not too spicy. i followed what others had suggested and added 2 cans 14.5 ounces tomato sauce, 1 can 14.5 diced tomatoes and 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies and the 29 ounces tomato juice which i probably shouldn't have coz it turned out a bit soupy.  i added the corn meal 1/4 c as others had suggested if you want to make the chili thicker but it still came out too soupy for me. next time i will skip the tomato juice. i followed everything else. slow cooked it for 6 hours. good chili. like it.

This was a basic but really good chili recipe.  Just what I was looking for.  I used 1 pound ground beef and one pound ground turkey, and omitted the green pepper, but followed the recipe otherwise.  The hubby loved it.  Will definitely make again!

This is my husband's favorite chili.  I did change the tomato juice to tomato sauce and tomato sauce to diced tomatoes.  The only other thing I did differently was add a bit more sugar because my husband and I like a sweeter chili.  Very good.  Very easy!  Highly recommended.

This was a pretty good chili recipe in my opinion.  I added a little more cumin for the smokiness. The recipe calls for 2 cups red beans.  Maybe this was why others said it was a little on the thin side.  I used 2 cans of beans and it was thick and declicious!

I have never been able to cook a decent bowl of chili.  In fact, my feeble attempts have become legend and the butt of many an ongoing family joke.  Yesterday, I cooked this exactly according to the recipe.  George Couch, I shall forever sing your praises. It was purr-fect.  You have freed me of my culinary chains.  I am no longer the Chump of Chili.  Thank you, George.  And pass the chili, please.

I love this recipe. It's very flavorful and easy to make. I normally make two batches, one for my kids just as the recipe states, and then a batch for my husband and me with a little kick. To add a little kick I add a fresh jalapeno pepper(stem chopped off) with the rest of the ingredients and also red pepper flakes. Yum.

What a wonderful chili!  I too made a few alterations:  I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, and just cut the beans to one can (kidney-red), leaving everything else the same, and this chili was spectacular.

I don't like chili, however this is really good! It makes a TON of chili, so if you are feeding your family, I would cut it in half. I kept a small container for leftovers, but have 2 LARGE throw-away freezer containers in the freezer. 
I served this with cornbread, cheese, and sour cream. My kids weren't too into it, as they thought it was spicy. I'm a spice wimp, and I thought it was just right. I didn't have cayenne pepper available, so I added a touch more chili pepper to the mix. I also added the 1/4 C of cornmeal suggested by another member to thicken it up, and it was the right consistency.
Thank you for such a great recipe! I'm thinking of adding a little chocolate next time. That's what a lot of my friends here in TX add instead of sugar.

This is a very good, basic chili. I left out the green pepper and celery since i didn't have any on hand and it was still very good. I will probably add a little more chili powder in the future since it was pretty mild. My kids loved it though. Served it w/corn bread, sour cream and cheese on the side. They ate all but 1 bowl (that i had for lunch the next day) and this makes a huge recipe. Everyone went back for 2nds. Simmered the pot for about 1 1/2 hrs and it was perfect. Not runny but nice and thick. I was worried about using tomato juice but it worked well. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making chili and we enjoyed it! Very good. I gave it a 4 because I'm sure there was room to play and make even better :)

The only thing I changed was to leave out the celery. I don't care much for celery.  I thought this was the best chili yet but my husband said he thought it was just okay. The kids also really liked it. Thanks for the recipe.

The only substitution I made for this recipe was to use V-8 juice instead of plain tomato juice.  We absolutely LOVED this!! It's my new favorite chili recipe! The spices give it a little bit of a bite, but we didn't think it was too spicy.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good chili! I made 1/2 the receipe and I didn't have tomato juice so I used V-8. After I cooked the meat, I sauteed the veggies. Added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for 1 hour.

Loved this recipie! Substituted seasoned finely diced tomatoes instead of the juice, and regular diced tomatoes instead of tomatoe paste.  Trust me its not too thick!!  Also I like my chillie a little spicy, so I added a jalapeno pepper.   All in all, a fantastic chillie!!

Don't know what it was about this chili recipe, but everyone in the family really enjoyed it.  I cooked everything on the stove top and then popped it into the slow cooker for 6 hours on low.  I think the cayenne added a nice zip!  Thanks!

I made this the other night, left out the celery, because I was out, used a little celery salt; used canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice  and sauce... And it was really good. Everyone in my family enjoyed better than the regular McCormick's  pre-packaged chili spices. Would make again for sure.

Very Easy Chili- if made with sauce and diced tomatoes its thick, like everyone wants! Its not spicy, so add more cayanne to up the flavor. I did add 1 lb sausage and it was good. I suggest a Tbs of BBQ sauce to punch up the flavor. Otherwise the best, easiest chili ever! Always great reviews wherever I take it!

This is really good chili.  I like that it's not too spicy, and the kids like that it's not full of chunks of tomatoes.  I made it just as the recipe reads (oops, I used brown sugar for white), wouldn't change anything (at least not on purpose!).  This may replace my old 'chunky' chili recipe!

I've never made chili before, and never was interested in making it, until my daughter had a craving for it. Well I'm glad I found this recipe to make my first batch of chili because it was excellent. I did use juice and diced tomatoes, instead of the other tomatoes products to make it more chunky, but it was still delicious. My daughter not only loved it, but all my co-workers and their wives.

I have to say that this is a great chili recipe!  I looked and looked for a simple recipe that tasted good and I have found it.  The only thing I add is diced tomatoes and it's just a texture preference.  Otherwise this recipe is great as is!  My husband loves this recipe and it's not too hot or too bland.  It' perfect for our family. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have never made chili before, but my entire family loves it.  So, I ventured off for a recipe & found this one.  I made it almost exactly as the original recipe called - only added a tad more cumin & a tad more cayenne pepper and cooked it in my crock pot for 4 hours rather than stove top.  It was a HIT!  My husband loved it & took leftovers with him to work every day until it was gone!  EVERY DAY!  That's a big deal!

This is really good, and now is my go to chili recipe. I did change one thing on the recipe and I used tomato sauce instead of soup because I didn't have any on hand. BUT it was perfect and I have not used the original in fear of ruining a good thing. I also didnt think I would like celery in chili, so I cut it up really thin and it is really nice!
This is simple, easy, and yummy!

This is pretty close to what I remember my grandma making. It smelled so wonderful and tasted just as it smelled. 
I did sub sauce for juice and I added red peppers as well but otherwise I followed just as and it turned out great!
I usually have a large portion leftover and last night the pot was empty!

Wonderful!  I made this last night for a football game because my brother in law requested chili.  I did change a few things,  I used a 29oz can of tomato sauce, 2 14 oz cans of stewed tomatos and 1 10oz can of tomato puree and I sauteed the green pepper and onion before adding it to the chili.  I also omitted the celery as a personal preference for my family and it was awesome!!  Even my sister raved about it and had leftovers tonight.  I served it with a Spoon bread which really made this top notch.  Will be adding this to my recipe box for sure

This is the best chili ever!  I made a double batch of this for an annual "pumpkin party" we have, half expecting most of it to be left over.  It was GONE!!!  It was easy and really, really good!

Will make again. Made as instructed, it's a nice simple chili. Chili is a very personal thing though, so I ended up adding a bottle of guiness, a little more cumin and a few generous squirts of korean hot sauce and cooking it down again.

Good chili.  I made the tomato subs like others recommended since I don't like it soupy either.  I put the onion & pepper in my chopper and fried them up.  They disappeared after cooking.  My 4 & 8 y.o LOVED it with Fritos, cheese & sour cream and asked for me to make it every day!

Wonderful and easy recipe; perfect for a cold night at home. This is will be my go-to chili recipe. It had a ton of flavor and meat is tender and not dry. I followed the recipe as is and served with a dollop of sour cream. Enjoy!

Very good, the best chili, and the simplest, I have made yet.  Great flavor with a nice little kick in your throat.

Great chili receipe as is! I made a few adjustments for my own taste preferences. I sauteed 3 teaspoons of minced garlic before adding ground beef to add some flavor in the meat. I omitted the celery and added 1 can of kernel corn for a nice contrast of sweet and spicy flavors.  I also added 2 tablespoons of chopped jalepeno for some extra spice. After 1.5 hours of simmering, I served it with fresh baked corn bread and topped it off with a dallop of sour cream and fresh cilantro.

This is an excellent dish, all the flavors blend perfectly together! Thanks for the great receipe George!

Sooo good and so easy! I made this on a cold night and it was perfect with a little cheese on top. My boyfriend ate 2 bowls! For an extra kick add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of 1/8. I will definetly make this again.

This is a great recipe.  Tried it for the first time the other night and with just slight changes it was a terrific basic chili.  I omitted the celery and green peppers. I also omitted the tomato juice and added 2 large cans (29oz) of crushed tomatoes and a tiny can of tomato paste.  The BF was waaaaay impressed.   This is a recipe you can count on!

I added extra chopped green pepper and some red pepper. After browning the meat with the vegetables, I threw it all in the crock pot. I agree with other posters - 46 oz. tomatoe juice seemed like way too much, so I only addded about 20 oz. Turned out very nice in the crock pot.

This is an excellent, easy chili recipe.  I can't say its "the Best!" but its definitely  good.  I added some chopped jalapeno to it to help give a little more kick... still not spicy enough in my opinion, but the spiciness that does exist is nice and even from start to finish.

This Chili has Great Flavor. I made it as directed (although I did use V8 instead of tomato juice as I do  in most recipes)and agree with others  that it needs thickening. I added crumbled ritz crackers to the finished product and that helped out. Next time I will try what others suggested with crushed tomatoes.  Thanks

very flavorful.  also pretty with the bits of green pepper and celery.  perfect amount of spice.  i used one can of red beans and one can of kidney beans.  also substituted the juice for sauce and the sauce for canned tomatoes like many others.  husband loved it.  too spicy for my 2 year old, as expected.  i will keep this one as my go to chili recipe, for sure...

AWESOME CHILI!!! I'm pregnant and I was craving chili and this recipe really hit the spot! It didn't give me any heart burn, and it was just right on the spiciness! I didn't do the tomatoe juice; I also did the diced tomatoes instead. My hubby loved it! We had it with a little bit of white rice. It was very quick and easy. I will def make this recipe again! You should def try it!!!!!!!

This was a great, easy recipe for a delicious bowl of chili.  I took the suggestion of several other reviewers and used stewed tomatoes instead (I blended these first for a smoother consistency).  I followed most everything else, except that I didn't use canned beans but threw my own homemade ones.  Thanks for a keeper!

Tried to rate this earlier today and something happened.  Oops!!

I have just made this chili for the 2nd time and this time I followed the recipe exactly as it was written except adding a chopped seeded jalapeno and letting it simmer for 3 hours.  It was AWESOME!!!  I made it last night (15 servings) for a football party and I made some changes as per the reviews.  It is MUCH better tonight.  

Wonderful recipe!  Thank you!

This is, by far, the best chili I've ever had.  Husband and the kids loved it.  We froze some in lunch size portions which husband took to work instead of frozen storebought dinners (much healthier and tastier).  We substituted tomato juice with tomato sauce, and substituted the tomato sauce the recipe called for with stewed tomatoes.  We also added one fresh diced jalepeno, no seeds.  We made Mexican Cornbread from this site, and it was great!  (We froze that too so husband could take a piece with his chili for lunch.)  This recipe is one to keep in your family recipes to pass on to future generations.  WONDERFUL!

Yum Yum Yum. This was the first time I had ever made chili, so I was just looking for a recipe for some guidence, but I ended up following this recipe exactly. I was a little short of 1/4 cup chili power, but I though what I had was great. It wasn't what I would call hot, so I added a few dashes of Louisana hot sauce to each bowel. I am eating the leftovers now at work and they are delish. By boyfriend and my co-workers all complimented it. 
Also, I substituted the juice for sauce (one and a half big cans) and the sauce for diced tomatos as others suggested because I like thick chili. It was very good and tomato-y. Would be great on spagetti!

Great chili! Didnt change a thing next time wont put as much spice in it b/c it was just a tad to hot for our 4 year old. We will just have to add the spice at the table instead. I have tried several variations of chili from this site and just my own and this is at the top of my list. Think next time I will add more variety of beans though.

Very good. I made this without the beans and it was very good.  I did add a little extra chili powder and cumin because I like my chili spicy.  Also added a bit more sugar because my tomato products were kind of tangy.  The next time I will add more onion, green pepper, and celery, which I think will make it even tastier. Really good topped with cheese.

I can't say how this recipe is exactly as it's written since I read the other reviews and changed some things first.  And I did a pretty bad of a job shopping so had to combine a few of the suggestions.  I used diced tomatoes in place of the tomato juice and 28 oz of tomato sauce.  And it did seem a little too thin, so I added the corn meal as someone suggested.   I used 2 cans of Bush's chili beans too.  It was great and  I'm excited for leftovers!

So simple yet delicious! I substituted 1 can diced tomatoes for the sauce and used less meat. It was divine when topped w/ cheddar cheese and sour cream!!! It is pretty tomatoey, so the next time I might add a bit of water to dilute a, but then again, if you add enough cheese and sour cream it will help cut back on the strong tomato flavor. A definate keeper!

It was simply OK. I thought it was a little bit bland, but I am sure with tweaking it could be better. It did make good leftovers, but I would have liked it to have more flavor as a whole.

Overall, my family liked the chili but thought it wasn't the best out there.  It was just alright is what they said.  I didn't add the beans because my family doesn't care for them and I didn't use the tomato juice but added crushed tomatoes and a couple cans of diced tomatoes.  I liked it with sour cream on top.  I just think it was missing something.

My boyfriend and I loved the chili! I added the can of chopped tomatoes as well and put a can of water, then let that cook down. I did not have the cayenne pepper, but it didn't matter. I will make this again! So simple.

I made this for a football party and got RAVE reviews. Instead of tomato juice, I used crushed tomatoes and upped the amount of cumin. Very tasty!

My family thought this chili taste like our favorite chili at Wendy's. I substituted 1 can of red beans to kidney beans, and the other to pinto beans. You do not need to add the sugar. If you want it to taste sweeter, just add basil; which naturally brings out the sweetness in tomatoes. I used stewed tomatoes, chopped up because I like little chunks of tomatoes. Once I added the sugar, it was too sweet, so I ended up using 2 bay leaves to cut the sweetness. I would make this recipe again, with my little tweeking.

This was very good.  I changed a few things, I didn't add the tomato sauce and used 64oz. of tomato juice, added 2 cups of water and beef bouillon.  Doesn't seem to be quite so acidic.  Added 3 small cans of beans and used the 2 tbsp. of garlic powder.  Everything else was the same.  Was never able to make a really good chili and now this one seems to be.  Thanks.

This is the best chili recipe ever!  My husband does most of the cooking because, let's face it, he's better at it than I am.  This was the easiest recipe I have ever attempted, and it came out perfect.  I followed the exact recipe, and I find myself wanting it everyday!

Pretty good, but not the best. Needed more spice I think; kind of plain as is and a little soupy. Didn't have onions, but kept everything else the same. Might make again with more spice, diced tomatoes, etc.

Very yummy chili.  I didn't change a thing.  I diced the onions, pepper, and celery very small by using a food processor.  We don't like chunky chili.  I was a little worried because I was impatient and tried it as soon as I got everything in the pot together and it tasted really tomatoey.  However, I let it go for the 1 1/2 hrs and it was so wonderful when done.  Perfect blend of spiciness and tomato flavor.  Perfect consistency - not too runny and not too thick.  I will be using it in a chili cookoff in a couple of weeks - hopefully the judges like it as much as we did.

Even thought it is 96 degrees out I fixed this chili to take to a birthday party.  It is DELICIOUS.  I'm making copies now for all the people that ate some.  I didn't change a thing.  Went by the recipe exactly.  It was sooooooo good!  And, even though there are a lot of ingredients it's relatively simple to make.  UMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!

Great Chili!!!!!!!! ... used this as a base added 1 can of chipotle  peppers, 1 can of corn, 2 jalapeno peppers, doubled the green pepper and onion, and because of all this added more tomato sauce. (Poured in a whole jar of pasta sauce because so many veggies made it too thick) Shredded fresh cheddar on top. I happen to like a lot of veggies and that's the only reason I added so many.

This is wonderful!!  Like many of you, I did make a few changes based on others' suggestions.  I replaced the tomato juice and 29oz can of tomatoes with 1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes with Jalapeno and 1 14.5 oz can diced with mexican spices.  I also added 2-15oz cans tomato sauce. I used 2 cans pinto beans rather than red beans (that is what I had on hand) and I added 1-4oz can fire roasted hot chiles and 1/4 t red pepper (we like our food spicy).  Everything else I did the same except I cooked it all in the crockpot while I was at work!  Leftovers freeze up GREAT!

This chili was not too spicy, but completely delicious! We threw in some extra peppers just because we had some, and it was amazing! Like another reviewer mentioned, we put in 1/4 c. cornmeal to add some thickness to it. Definitely wouldn't change anything else!

WOW!  This tastes like the chili I grew up with...only updated with the spices I've come to love as I've grown older.  Made some changes to the tomato product line-up (as have many others) but really just to use what I had on hand.  I kept the volume amount the same.  Like another reviewer, I added some cornmeal to make my chili thicker, but that doesn't really alter the flavor.  I served it over elbow macaroni (again, a family thing).  Really easy, really tasty...thanks George!!!

This recipe was yummy! It definately had a kick to it! Use caution and add the chili powder slowly and see how much spice you can handle. Made a few other changes as well: used diced tomatoes and tomato sauce instead; added half a cup of chopped carrots; used a few cloves of fresh minced garlic instead; added a teaspoon of paprika; used half kidney beans and half pimento beans. Served it with a heaping spoonful of sour cream, some grated cheddar cheese, and fresh cilatro to garnish. Had some fresh dinner rolls to sop up the chili too! Definately a keeper in my recipe box!

Never made Chili before and this was easy and great flavor. Maybe some diced tomatoes next time in place of the sauce for some chunks.

This is very good chili. I had to substitute and use 2 cans of tomato sauce and a can of chopped tomatoes because I did not have the juice. I also doubled the cayenne pepper and used two jalapenos to make it spicy. Instead of the garlic powder I used minced garlic (2tablespoons) and cooked it with the ground beef. Still turned out very good. One of the best chilis I have eatin

I adjusted this recipe for 50 people for our church's Spud Sunday fund raiser for our youth mission trip. The chili was used as one of the toppings on the baked potatoes. Everyone raved about the delicious chili. Thanks for a winner.

Easy and delicious.  DH felt it had too much tomato sauce, however DS & I loved it as is.  As others before me stated...I added a little more cayenne pepper and used about 1/8 cup corn meal to thicken!  Thanks for such a good chili and beans (I've looked and looked and tried and tried, this is the best yet!).

good, but i added quite a few things to spice it up.  first of all, i browned the meat with the spices called for, plus paprika and coriander, but also added the called for spices to the rest of the chili (so all-in-all, doubled the spices... at least tripled the chili powder).  i also added 3 cloves of finely-diced garlic, one diced carrot, 3 diced Anaheim peppers, 2 diced Serrano peppers, & a bit extra of each other vegetable.  this made the chili very fresh!  yummy!

I have been looking for a great chili recipe and THIS IS IT!! It has the perfect combination of sweet, salty and spicy. I did use 2 cans of chili tomatos in place of the juice and added 1 12oz can of Spicy V8. This recipe is wonderful. My hubby loved it too. This will be a keeper!

I am a novice cook (to say the least!) and this was a really easy recipe for me and it is soooo good! My boyfriend likes to take the leftovers to work for lunch all week. I can’t wait to make it for the rest of my family. I use ground turkey instead of beef to reduce the fat and  for next time I would like to sub a can of black beans for a can of red beans. Possibilities are end-less with this one!!

This is a staple recipe in my house.  I use the recipe as a base and tweek depending on the ingredients I have in stock. I always half the recipe for me and husband (makes plenty).  Without exception I never have tomatoe juice so I instead puree whatever tomatoe products I have that adds up to the amount of oz the recipe calls for (diced tomatoes, whole, petite cut, whatever) and add the small can tomtoe sauce or paste (again, whatever I have). I use the spice ratio almost to a tee....just add a bit more cayanne.  I love that you brown meat, drain, add everything, and cover.  Easy, great tasting.

I almost followed this exactly and it was excellent.  I only had 3 (8oz) cans of tomato sauce.  I used 1 lb of ground turkey & 1 lb of ground hamburger which I added the onion,minced garlic, salt & pepper to.  I added an add'l yellow pepper w/ the green. I also added a large can of pinto beans and 1 small can of kidney beans.  Overall this was a great recipe, I wouldn't mind adding a can of diced tomato's as well.  Might try that next time.  **BIG HIT**

Delicious chili and so comforting on a chilly night! Very easy to make too. I have made this chili many times using different canned tomato variations, and bell pepper and bean varieties and it has always turned out wonderful. It's easy to tweak to suit your taste. I like to use 2 bell peppers, 2 cans beans, and celery with the leaves. The longer you let it simmer the better, the flavors really get to meld together. Serve with some sharp cheddar and monterey jack, green onion, olives, and sliced avocado-warm cornbread too!

I have made this chili many times, and from the first time, when I followed the recipe exactly, I have loved it. Since my husband and I like it very thick and spicy, I have added jalepeno, more beans, and tomato paste. This is such an easy recipe to follow and make your own.

I made this with a friend to enter into a chili contest. We made it exactly to the recipe but the changed it up a bit adding crushed red pepper flakes and Chili seasoning. The Chili seasoning really made it taste great. The recipe was great because the tomato juice makes a great sauce around the chili. We won the contest, so i'd say this recipe is great.

Awesome. This was my first attempt at chili and I have to say I was quite pleased with the results.  The recipe is a can't miss.  Since I like my foods on the spicy side, I added 2 teaspoon chopped jalapeños and an extra 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper to liven things up a bit (again just me liking things spicy).  Otherwise, this recipes is good to go and is sure to be a hit with family and friends.

I have never made chili before and this is the best! Not too bland, not too spicy. It's perfect. I put a medium size can of crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes. If you think it's a little too thick, use a can of V8 juice. It comes out great. Perfect, chunky chili!

We loved  it!  This is the best chili we have ever had. I added the salt but my husband felt alittle to salty so next time I won't add the salt. I didn't have tomatoe juice so I added instead a quart sized jar of my home canned tomatoes and the juice that was in with it. It seemed nice and thick. Will make again!!!!!!!

I made this chili for my family last night and everyone loved it ... they all had seconds. I didn't have tomatoe sauce so I substituted a can of chili ready diced tomatoes and a can of petite diced tomates. Also I was a little leary of using 1/4 cup chili powder, so put in a little less. Next time I might try to full amount although my family doesn't want me to change anything. It was a very cold day yesterday & it was the perfect meal. I served it with cornbread. This one is definitely a keeper.

Awesome chili.  The second time I made it, I didn't have celery or bell pepper so I left it out and it still came out wonderfully!  I do add Rotelle, though, because I like it really spicy.

I've never made good chili before today... I've only made "ok" or "hmm" chili.  But TODAY, I impressed my husband!  I followed the recipe with only one change: canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Worked great.  Seasonings perfect for our family with two younger children -recipe can be tweaked if you like it hotter.

My husband and I tried this recipe last night.  I loved it!  I usually add stuff to every recipe to make it my own, but I did not have to do that to this one.  We ate dinner and I froze the rest so we can have it another night.  I'm also eating it for lunch right now.  Not too spicy but has a kick.

Good, but not the best homemade chili I've had.  I added mushrooms and liked the texture they gave.  The problem for me was with the spices; I think there was too much cumin.  I'll try it again with less and see if I like it better then.

Excellent recipe. Substituted pinto beans for red beans and diced tomatoes for tomato juice (did not have either that were called for). Turned out great, just added about 1/2 cup ketchup to give it a little more tomatoey flavor. Even better as leftovers!! Try with the "Homesteader Cornbread" recipe on this site.

Made this today and it turned out really good. I'd added diced tomatoes and eyed balled the rest of the tomatoey stuff. Turned out really good..didn't think it was spicy like everyone says it is though.

Would make this again.

Very good, nice flavor -- I would have added more beans for our taste, and perhaps more green peppers to give it a little more texture and make it a little healthier.

This chili tastes great, but I had to leave it on the stove for two hours, as I found it too liquid. I also substituted to juice for sauce and the sauce for diced tomatoes. I added 1 teaspoon of cocoa and increased the sugar.

Completely AWESOME and easy chili recipe.  My 6 yr old wants to know why I don't make chili everyday!!  I didn't use any celery (didn't have any), cayenne pepper (for my kids sake), and used 1 glove of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Totally yummy!  Thank you!

Excellent chili! A little bit on the spicier side for my 2 year old, even without the cayenne pepper, but she ate it anyway! Next time I will try using diced tomatoes (as suggested by many other reviewers), but to be honest, this chili is pretty much perfect on its own! Will make again and again.

Absolutely excellent recipe!!!  I made it exactly according to the directions (minus the celery) and it turned out fantastic.  Oh and I did add a little more chili powder because I like it more spicy.  Next time I'd do the same, but possibly use just a tad less tomato juice.  Either/or, it was excellent and definitely one to keep at the top of the recipe box.

My DH and I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious...although we changed so many things that we probably should just post our own recipe!  Here is what we did:  cut the recipe in half to 5 servings; used 2 cups tomato juice; omitted the tomato sauce; added 1 can "spicy red pepper" diced tomatoes; 4 cloves garlic; omitted the green pepper; added 1 can kidney beans and 1 can brown beans in molasses; we also increased the amount of sugar to about 1 Tbsp and the amount of chili powder by an additional 2 tsp.  We simmered stovetop for about 2 hours and then transferred to a slow cooker for about 3 or 4 hours.  The end result was absolutely delicious served with sour cream, grated cheddar and sliced green onion.

YOWZAA!!! This is a great chili recipe.  Didn't want to mess with the recipe but had to tinker just a bit.  Added 1 tsp of ground coffee and 2 tsp of corn starch to thicken a bit more.  7 diced black olives and renamed it Fumi's Famous 4 Alarm Chile.  Good on ya George, best darn chile recipe I've ever used.

Awesome chili!  Made small additions- used black and pinto beans, 1 lb of beef, onions and peppers of course, added cocoa powder and cinnamon.    Boyfriend said first, "This is some fireball stuff!" and so we added some sour cream, his next comment "This is the best chili you ever made."    Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really good.  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and a can of tomato sauce for the tomato sauce/juice.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Very flavoful and I really liked just the touch of sugar.

Easy to make, uses a variety of spices but well-balanced. I substitute ground turkey for the meat and use a couple cans of diced italian tomatoes to give it a chunkier texture (instead of the sauce). I haven't tried another chili recipe since I found this one. I especially like the celery which balances out the spicy flavors. I usually make a pot on Sunday, and it always tastes better the next day.

Very popular with the family. I like less of a tomato based chili, so I added some beef bullion in place of some of the tomato juice and the stewed tomatoes. I also used spicy V-8 instead of plain tomato juice, and added spice to my own taste. Excellent- and I would highly recommend.

My family loves this chili.  I use ground turkey, omit the celery and use a big can of tomato sauce in place of the juice and add a can of diced tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce.  We sprinkle it with shredded cheese and the kids eat it with "Scoops" tortilla chips.  Yum!!

We loved this. I added carrots for a little crunch and left out the celery. I also used pinto beans with jalapeños in them in place of one can of red beans.

This is the best chili I've ever had!  Instead of the tomato juice, I used 2- 48 oz cans of stewed tomatoes(pureed), and I messed up and added too much sugar, but it is still awesome!  Thanks for the recipe George!

This chili disappeared so fast in my house and I made a big pot too. Anyway my whole family is vegetarian so I substituted the meat w/soy meat and it came out perfect and great. This recipe is sooo easy, I recommend it to anyone who is a chili lover.

Left out the celery & green pepper & will add a little more cayenne pepper next time, but giving this 5 stars as we LOVED it!  That's big coming from him b/c he's always hated every chili recipe I've ever made.  This is my new chili recipe of choice!

This is a great basic chili you can count on.  Only thing I did different was what others mentioned, used real garlic instead of powder and ground sirloin for the meat.  Vary the heat by using hot or regular chili powder or half of each.  -Susie

This was a hit at my football bash tonight! For a party of 6, I ended up using 2 lb of beef (mixture of lean and not-so-lean ground beef), 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1 can of Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes for extra heat. Not a big fans of beans, so I ended up just using 1 can of red kidney beans. I like the chili a lot hotter so I also added 1 seeded jalapeno pepper plus a few more teaspoons of cayenne and chili powder. Served this with hot dogs and tonnes of cheddar cheese. DELICIOUS!

This is a very good base chili recipe, my husband and I both loved it.  Like other reviewers, I did make changes, they were: adding a bit more garlic because we love it, 1/2-1 cup of chicken broth to give it more liquid, using tomato sauce instead of tomato juice, 2 T. of tomato paste, I used 2lbs. of ground turkey and 2 links of Italian Sausage (no seeds) instead of beef. 

This spiciness of the chili was balanced very nicely by eating Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread with it.  The recipe for that can be found here at allrecipes.

Great recipe.  I add a bottle or two of beer for flavor and to thin out the mix a bit.

OMG! Fab recipe!!! Absolutely wonderful! The changes I made were to add a lot of corriander, some black bean sauce, a little chicken wing hot sauce, crushed tomatoes instead of tomatoes huice, and black beans as well  as red beans. Served with corn bread, and it was SUCH a hit! Thanks for this recipe. It's going to become a regular for sure! :)

Very nice recipe.  A little too hot for our tastes, but really good nonetheless.  Great base to start with, and terrific since it's all from scratch with pretty ordinary spices (at least we already had them!).

I thought that this had a good flavor to it, but it was way too thick for me, I like my chili the consistency of Wendy's chili, probably will not make again.

This chili was awesome!  I took the advice of others and used a combination of tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and tomato juice.  I didn't use celery but used a yellow bell pepper along with the green.  I cooked everything but the beans the night before and let it sit in the the fridge overnight.  Then I heated it back up with the beans the next afternoon for lunch.  It was excellent. My father-in-law who doesn't like chili liked it too! I served it with cheddar and sour cream.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

I love this chili so much I have trouble breaking away to try other recipes! I make it with tomato puree and canned diced tomatoes, and recently I tried lean ground turkey instead of beef. It came out just as good.

Me and my husband loved this recipe. I omitted the tomato juice and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 tablespoon of chili flakes.   I can't wait to make it again.

Very good chili.  Since I do not like too much spice, I only used 1/2 of the chili powder and it still had a little bite.  I also did not use tomato juice and doubled the tomato sauce and added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes as I like tomatoes in the chili.  But otherwise, I kept everything just as is!

First place winner at SuperBowl Chili Cook-off!  Yes, I won the contest with this great, easy recipe.  The only change I made was to eliminate the cayenne pepper because I don't like it too spicy.  Out of 10 chilis, this won the show!  Great recipe -- I'll use it all the time now.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe!  You don't even need to tweak it to make it any better, the recipe is great as is.  Definitely taste better if you let sit for a day in the fridge.  A must keep recipe, better than my mother's own chili recipe!

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to use 1 lb. of gound beef and 1 lb of venison sausage. I think the sausage adds a little extra zip. I've made this several times and used V-8 when I didn't have tomato juice on hand. Yum! This is the only recipe I'll use for chili. Thanks!

Very good!  Had this tonight and put it over white rice.  Did however replace the tom juice with diced tomatos (with garlic and onion and oregano).  Other than that followed it to a T.  What a great dish when its cold and snowy outside.

I made this chili a month ago and my husband and I love it. I didn't use as much tomato juice and added 1/2 cup of store-bought chunky salsa for a little extra kick! I'll keep this one in my recipe box. Thanks, George! I halfed this recipe to accomadate just me and my husband hence the 1/2 cup salsa.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used three cans of diced tomatoes and a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice and tomato sauce the recipe called for.  I also added a sliced and seedless jalapeno along with a whole jalapeno to the recipe.  I served the chili with cornbread.  It was absolutely wonderful.

this was an EXCELLENT recipe.  tasted fantastic - i made for a friends BDAY dinner along with some slow cooked ribs and i must say the chili was a huge hit.  i made extra hoping for leftovers - but these were gone the next day.  i've since had to give the recipe to most of my guests as they all liked it so much!  

i did make a couple of small changes due to personal preference / dietary concerns.  First, instead of ground beef i used 98% lean turkey and i also added about a pound of mild italian sausage.  instead of using tomato sauce and tomato juice, i used tomato sauce and a can of stewed tomatos.  everything else was per receipe.  Try it - you will NOT be disappointed.

This is the second time I have made this chili and it is absolutely the best recipe for chili I have ever found! I followed the recipe exactly both times. The flavors and spices are perfectly balanced to my families taste.  If a 15 year old teen son approves it, then it IS good! Thanks for the recipe George!

This is the best chili I have ever made!!  I usually don't make chili often because I have never found a good recipe, until now.  I did, however, take the advice of others and use crushed tomates and tomato sauce instead of tomato juice.  I think I might try it with a vegetable juice next time.  For more nutritional value.  I made it for my family and for a potluck and everybody loved it!  There were NO leftovers!

Very good response. I tripled this recipe and served it at a party.  Everyone enjoyed it and reqested the recipe.  I was worried at the amount of chili powder that the recipe called for, but I used the indicated amount and it was great. Not too spicy.

Very good chili.  I did as others said and substituted the tomoto juice for a 29 oz can of tomato sauce and 1/2 a can of left over spaghetti sauce (16 oz jar.)  I subbed the tomato sauce for two cans of diced tomatoes with suace.  Really good.  Next time I am going to try it with one lb group beef and one lb ground sausage.

YUM  YUM  YUM!  I wondered about the 1/4 cup of chili powder, but the flavor of this mixture is wonderful!  I did make changes for personal taste & texture, but for me, this was an excellent base to work from.  Like others, I subbed out the tomato juice for 2 of the large cans of tomato sauce (29oz) and then the tomato sauce for 1 large can of diced tomatoes.  I don't care for kidney beans so I used 1 drained can of pinto beans & 1 can of chili beans, partially drained.  Chopped jalepeno pepper was a good addition. I served over macaroni noodles with some cheese & sour cream & it was SO GOOD!!  My husband bragged for days!!

This chili is delicious! I usually put beans in mine but this one was fine without it! It was a little too spicy for the kids, though. I've made this recipe twice now. Next time I think I will not put in so much chili powder. This is a great recipe!

Amazing! My bf and I agreed this is the BEST chili we've ever had. Only substitution we made was soy crumbles in place of beef. Love it! Thanks for sharing.

This chili's flavor is good, however, I didn't realize until reading all the comments that everybody is making the chili thicker by substituting the chili juice for sauce. I wish someone would post this recipe with the  good ingredients and THEN rate it 5 stars. Although I admit next time I'll just swap out the juice and hopefully it will be thicker. Thanks!

VERY good flavor.  Tasted similar to my favorite fat-free canned chili.  It did come out somewhat runny, so next time I plan to dump the tomato juice, and use tomato sauce as others have suggested.  Overall it was a hit!

I just made this recipe for my co-workers and it was a huge hit!  I did tweak the recipe a bit--I used crushed tomatos instead of juice, added two packages of MorningStar Veggie Crumble (sorta like fake beef), some carrots, and black beans.  I sauted the onion and pepper and also sauted some mushrooms and a yellow pepper.  My co-workers and I take turns making lunch for each other every Friday and my colleague cooking next week says he has a tough act to follow!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it came out fabulous. I was a little scared it would be watery with the tomato juice but it wasn't in the slightest. It was perfect we made this along with the waikiki cornbread on this site and it was  a perfect winter meal!

Only because I changed it up a bit that it could have been 5 stars. I didn't put 1/4 cup of chili powder and that might be a mistake in the recipe..I put 1 tablespoon of chili powder, 1 can of pinto beans and 1 can of chili beans. I also didn't have tomato juice or sauce so I used 1 can of tomato paste and added 2 cups of water and two cans of diced tomatoes and it I thought it was amazing. I have made it twice in two weeks. Mine could have had more cayenne to it though.

Great recipe for what I needed it for. My 2 teenagers don't like chli with tomato chunks and this recipe fit the bill.  My  16 year old son said it was the "best chili he ever had." The flavor is excellent. If you like more tomato chunks just add canned tomatoes like everyone else did.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not find it to be too runny.  However I added 2 cans of kidney beans that probably added up to more than 2 cups as the recipe called for.  If you let the chili simmer the full hour and a half it simmers down to a thicker consistency. Next time I will make a double recipe however so I have more leftovers to freeze for another meal.

Fantastic chili!!! I made two batches and added on 29oz can tomato sauce and one can of Rotel tomatoes. Used dried beans rather than canned. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next would like to add cilantro (love the flavor).

Wow what a great recipe. I found this recipe as a way to use leftover redbeans i had made. I only used ingredients on hand, since i didn't have everything so i improvised. I used V-8 juice, Mild Rotel chopped tomatoes, salsa and 3/4 of a corona to make up the volume.  Left over red beans with the sauce it had made. Italian seasoning (as I had no oregano). And I added a can of corn.  MY KIDS WHO EAT NOTHING, ATE THIS AND LOVED IT. Grade A recipe that can be made a thousand way. Thank you sooo much for sharing.

With just a few changes, this is my new chili recipe!  We like more beans, more bell pepper, and more spice, usually a chopped up jalapeno.  This is super easy and great - thanks a ton!

Good, classic chili.  Just the right amount of kick.  I followed the recipe exactly except substituted black beans for kidney beans because I was out of the kidney.  Next time I may add some stewed or diced tomatoes.  I will definately make this again.

Very good chili recipe.  I scaled it down to half the recipe.  The only thing I did differently, was I added one diced jalapeno pepper, and threw in a whole one, as suggested on a previous review.  We discarded the whole pepper after the chili was cooked.  It gave it just enough heat for us!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that I substituted the tomato juice for sauce and sauce for diced tomatoes.  I added a little more chili powder and cayenne to make it spicier, and a little less celery.  It really does taste like Wendy's chili which is great since I'm in Japan now and hardley ever get to have the real thing.

This was a great recipe but I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and made it less watery by changing the tomato juice to tomato sauce.  I liked and agreed with another reviewer who likened the taste to Wendy's Chili, whose recipe I've been searching for, for years.  I think I would use a litte less onion next time and if I used sugar (I can't remember), it was so scant that I didn't even notice it.
Lovely, and has made my permanent recipe collection.

I love this chili recipe - very easy and everyone loves it.  The only change I make is that I do not add the salt. Very yummy on those cold winter nights...

This makes a great pot of chili!  It is easy because all of the ingredients are easy to keep on hand and it make a huge pot...enough to send home with the college daughter and her roommates!

This was the best chili we've tried so far and very close to my mother-in-law's recipe -- which made my hubby happy.  I cut out the green peppers and the cayenne; I added a can of drained black beans.  Very good and thick.

Great chili with a little kick!  I'm very sensitive to hot, spicy foods, so I'm happy to say that the chili powder and cayenne pepper did not overwhelm me!  This chili's got a great flavor and makes for a very hearty meal.

This was a nutricous delicious recipe. I used zuccini in place of peppers and stewed tomatoes in place of tomato juice and it came out great. Not too spicy, just the way I like it.

The best chili recipe I have ever made. Family and friends raved about this dish. When you get multiple requests for this recipe, you know it is great. I watched a co worker try this chili and all he could say was " God Almighty this is perfect. "

This was very good.  I omitted the green pepper, as nobody in our house likes it.  Made 1/2 with beans and 1/2 without-- the no bean disappeared first.  Next time will cut back on the spices a little for the kids.  Will definitely make again, though.

We all loved this chili!  I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I left out was cayenne pepper because I didn't have any, and it still tasted great.  I will definitely make this regularly.

Wonderful!  I used this recipe for a small "chili cook off" & it won, hands down!  I kept hearing everyone say that it tasted like Wendy's.  Although, I think it's a bit spicier than Wendy's, which is what they all liked (& I didn't even use the cayenne pepper, as I forgot to buy it).  Thanks for this recipe - it's a keeper!

This chili is really good!  I followed the instructions almost completely.  Because I don't want to cry while chopping onions I omitted them and added some white mushrooms and some portebello mushrooms.  I think there's a few different types of chili mixes.  Considering that this recipe asks for 1/4 cups I picked the kind that was less spicy.  It didn't turn out that spicy but in my opinion 1/4 cups of chili powder is too much powder to be adding.  I simmered it for 2 hours and mixed it too but I still feel that the chili powder isn't that well blended into the mix.  Next time maybe I'll use less chili powder and add some hot sauce to it or use a little bit of the more spicy chili powder.

This recipe was so good!  I did add an extra pound of ground beef and threw it all in crockpot!  It turned out delicious!  I have added this to my recipe binder.

This was a good recipe. You can make it as spicy or as mild as you like. Instead of tomato sauce I used Spicy V-8 Juice. I will be making this again.
