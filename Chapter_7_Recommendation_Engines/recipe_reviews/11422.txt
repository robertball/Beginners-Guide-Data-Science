I made a few alterations to this recipe and it came out perfect. I added a little brown sugar which I discovered makes sugar cookies great on accident one day... I also added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar. Then I did pecans in place of the walnuts. They turned out great!!

Really good! I didn't peel the peaches and I pureed them for a more even texture!

This is a very basic recipe and not very interesting BUT its a great start! I used butter instead of shortening and I also added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp.cinnamon. I will continue to use this recipe as a base and change it to what I have on hand.

These were pretty great except I think I might use a wee bit more sugar next time. I used canned peaches as that's all I had (I seem to have a staggering amount of them in the pantry) and of course they were easier to chop that way but I dunno how it would affect the overall taste as opposed to fresh. Hubby gave them a thumbs -up and that's what I look for in a winning recipe!

These cookies were quite good. I ate half of the first batch! I added a teaspoon of vanilla since others said they were lacking in flavor which was a nice touch. I looked at the cookies as they were baking and thought they were too flat so I added flour before the next batch. BAD idea. The cookies have a very cake like fun texture that I hadn't had in so long and really love but adding flour makes them too much work to eat! Too chewy. Its hard to tell when these cookies are done and they kind of take a while. I baked them at 350 and still they took 15 minutes. Next time I will add maybe a half cup more nuts. I definitely recomend this recipe for using up peaches as my tree this year is overproducing and I know the feeling of needing stuff to do with all of the fruit!

Even after adding TWO cups of pureed peaches these cookies didn't taste like peaches. They didn't double in size either. They're a decent cake-like cookie but since we prefer crisp or chewy cookies we probably won't make these again.

As stated by others they are too soft and not much peach flavor. Maybe next time I will cut back on the shortening and add more peaches.

This recipie with suggestions from other reviews and a small twist of my own was great as a muffin! Just for fun I used 1/2 cup of shortening and a 1/2 cup of margarine 1tsp each of nutmeg cinnamon and vanilla - which it really needed! Extra peaches and just because I had them and they were not the freshest a pint of strawberries. I didn't put the nuts inside but sprinkled slivered almonds on the top of each one and some got a thinly sliced peach on top. I baked them at 350 of rabout 20 minutes and they were very moist and tasty (although not peachy) muffins.

This recipe was not very good. The cookies turned out bland and very crumbly and limp. I tried to thicken them up by adding a bit more flour but that didn't seem to help. They are good if you aren't into much flavor and like very plain food. I used canned peaches and added about twice as much as the recipe called for. The addition seemed to help add a bit a flavor. Overall I doubt I will make these again.

I used some of the suggestions and substituted margarine for the shortening and instead of 1 cup of peaches I added about 3. I also added in cinnamon nutmeg and a dash of vanilla. These were easy to make and they made nice cake-like cookies but the taste isn't really that peachy or special at all.

My daughter needed a peach recipe to share with classmates and I made these. I used baking powder accidently instead of baking soda but they still turned out great. They didn't double in size while cooking which I'm thinking came from using powder instead of soda..

I had to throw these cookies away. I was not pleased with the outcome at all. They were extremely dry and did not double in size. Hopefully I did not mess the recipe up. I am a very good cook but...

Delicious cookies! I used two peaches so it was probably about double what the recipe called for but I wanted plenty in there. As other people suggested I used 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar and added in about 1 tsp vanilla. I mixed in about 1/4 cup slivered almonds since that's what I had. Each batch baked for 15 minutes and didn't brown a lot but came out cooked just right. Nice soft cookie with lots of flavor! My whole family is inhaling them!

I added an extra peach and pureed all of them with the skin on and added a tsp. of cloves to the dry ingredients. The cookies turned out fluffy and chewy with a hint of peach flavour. But taste more like muffins than cookies. Overall pleasant... will try again.

These rose well and had a nice texture but they were surprisingly tasteless--no peach flavour (and that was with more peach than called for by the recipe) just sweet bland dough. I would suggest adding cinnamon or some other spice or perhaps peach extract.
