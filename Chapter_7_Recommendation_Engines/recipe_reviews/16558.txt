I too doubled the dressing and thought it was delicious. Grilled chicken may be used instead of fried chicken as well.

The chicken was really good. However the dressing didn't quite turn out right it was too watery.

I found the dressing a little oily, but the taste
was great.  I doubled the dressing mixture.

Money is real tight so I used leftover Tanya's Louisiana Southern Fried Chicken from a few night's before and omitted the peppers only because I didn't have any. I tripled the dressing only because I made it according to recipe and it wasn't near enough. I also didn't cook it, I just whisked it in a small bowl and drizzled it over the salad. This was okay, not our favorite. I think this would be better with fresh spinach and tomatoes without the rice. The dressing suited the fried chicken really well, though.

Made as written except that I doubled the dressing. The dressing was thin as another mentioned but I think it was designed to be so that it wilts the lettuce nicely. With that being said, I think baby spinach leaves would work great in this recipe. I love cornmeal in my breading but it does have that grit to it so if that texture bothers you, flour only would work just fine too. I thought this was pretty tasty and one that could be changed up with whatever salad fixings you had on hand.

I thought the chicken came out very moist, but I didn't think the breading stuck to well to the chicken.
