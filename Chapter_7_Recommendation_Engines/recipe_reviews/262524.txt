This was VERY good!  Because I had to use what I had at home, I didn't have Johnsonville chicken so I used regular boneless chicken breast I cut up (I seasoned the chicken very well in a pan with oil).  No bell peppers, so I used an half onion to replace that.  Like the other poster, I had to add a bit more chicken broth, but I'll be making this again.

My kids loved it and asked for seconds!!

This was a very good, quick recipe. I used Neufchâtel cheese and a little additional chicken broth but otherwise followed the recipe. I’ll be making this again soon.

I made it as directed, and it was delicious! Next time, I think I'll sauté the peppers, garlic, and lemon zest by themselves before adding the peas a little later, so the garlic and lemon are incorporated throughout the whole dish, and the peas aren't quite so soft. I also used more than 1 tsp of lemon zest, probably closer to 1.5 or 2 tsp; I'd go even heavier on the lemon zest. You need a lot of lemon to balance out that much garlic. I think I also ended up with more than 2 cups of pasta, and that worked out really well. There was plenty of cream cheese and everything to coat it all. Overall, an excellent dish, and very easy to prepare!

This recipe had a nice flavor but I found it too salty. Next time I would add half water to the chicken broth and only add 1/2 package of cream cheese as I found it to be too much cream cheese.

My wife and I thought this was awesome.  Easy meal to make, and super tasty.  Creamy taste without using cream or lots of butter.  Recipe calls for either peas or asparagus, but I used some of both.  Otherwise made exactly as directed (minus the fresh oregano).
