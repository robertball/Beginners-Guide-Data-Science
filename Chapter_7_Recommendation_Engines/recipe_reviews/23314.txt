My roomates and I love this recipe as it is extremely easy to prepare.

I bake my chimis at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes instead of frying...not only is it healthier, but you don't have all that mess of frying.  We can whip up a pretty healthful and delicious meal in about half an hour.

I didn't bother with the quacamole topping because I'm a bit lazy...and not a huge guac and sour cream fan.  But adding red enchilada sauce is a must!!

I loved this recipe.  I did however out rolled chimis in a casserole dish, brushed with butter and baked them at 400 for 20-30 minutes until they were crispy and golden!  Delicious and a lot cleaner.  I didn't make the topping and just served it with sour cream and homemade gauc!  Yum Yum!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot, I brushed olive oil on the tortillas and baked them in the oven instead of frying. I used more olives and prepared the ingredients the day before to lessen prep time. I added hot taco seasoning to the rice and cooked chicken (I love spicy food and this recipe seemed a bit bland), and the flavor was wonderful. Great recipe with lots of room for experimentation!

I did end up having enough for a lot more than six servings, however.

Absolutely great recipe!  We did opt to bake ours at 400 for 25 minutes vs. frying.  I would also suggest adjusting the time to do all of the prep work - it definitely took longer than 20 minutes to chop and prepare the ingredients.  I would suggest doing all of the prep work ahead of time in order to assemble and cook these quicker.  ;o)

I took some time to prepare the rice and chicken in advance, that way when it was dinner time all I had to do was assemble to chimis and fry. I used refried black beans which gave them a good authentic mexican flavor. Also, I made the the guacamole and a homemade salsa earlier in the day. The time they chilled in the frige made the flavors come together nicely. My whole family loved these chimis. Will definately become a family favorite. Also, I made about 15 chimis by useing the recipie adjuster on the website. Finally as you roll the chimis you will get better at rolling and tucking them tightly. Practice makes perfect.

My sixteen year old said these are the best chimi's he's ever had.  Too bad they are kind of time consuming but I will now have to make them again when you get a compliment like that.

These were a bit more time-consuming than stated, and you have to make sure not to stuff them too full because then they spill out in the frying pan when you try to flip them.  Once I finally got that down, however, they were delicious!  The guacamole sauce was the biggest hit with my boyfriend.  Just make sure you leave yourself a full hour to prepare these!!!

Love this recipe! My husband is a picky eater and he had nothing but praise for the chimichangas-A real accomplishment! I also cooked these up for my family and shared the recipe with some friends. 
Recipe cooks up easy and leaves little to clean up.
I am very pleased. Ingredients can be cooked/chopped ahead and assembled later. I also grilled them in my george foreman grill for an extra cripsy outside!

this is a great recipe - you may want to add a red enchilada-type sauce to pour over the chimis.  very tasty and easy to make!

This is the best meal I and my family have had!  We would definately order this in a restaurant!  I had a blast making it.  I only used half an onion in the rice and omitted the other.  I also didn't have any olives.  I deep fried it.  Thank-you!!

I love chimichangas and this was my first attempt at making them...and what a successful one it was.  These are easy and delicious.  I used canned chicken breast, which although it is canned, I feel when putting it in something like this where you are smothering them with sauce and stuffing them in a tortilla, it turns out great.  Its the cheapest and easiest way to get chicken for something like this.

These were so delicious.  My boyfriend even said that they were better than the chimis at our favorite Mexican restaurant!  I baked them at 400 degrees for 25 minutes instead of frying for easier cleanup.  They freeze well also.  I just reheat them at 350 degrees for about 30-35 minutes, until heated through.  They are even still crispy!

LOVED this recipe.  Simple, tasty, pleasing to everyone!  Also love that I can make it ahead of time.  To simplify without changing the recipe, I cooked the rice and added the beans and cooked chicken to make a mixture.  Then I stuffed the tortillas and brushed with oil and placed under the broiler to get them nice and crisp.  Topped with sauce, shredded lettuce and sour cream.  Thank you for sharing!  (Family was fighting over leftovers!)

Yesterday when I made these my first thought was the instructions could have been simplified by combining some of the ingredients. I used green enchilada sauce instead of red (personal preference). Other than that sub and the topping, I followed the recipe. In the future I will use half of the amount of chicken, half of the refried beans, and about 1/3 of the onion. That alone will still make about a dozen if you use regular fajita size tortillas. One key is keeping the tortillas soft enough to work with. I put 2 or 3 at a time in the microwave for about 20 seconds at a time. Once they cooled off they were harder to work with. Start your filling on one end and then start rolling them. As for the topping,I sort of strayed from that. I cut the avacado into wedges so it could be optional, and made a sort of pico de gallo out of the other ingredients. I also made velveeta cheese sauce to drizzle on top of the chimi. I fanned out the wedges of avacado, dolloped some sour cream and piled the pico de gallo mixture all on the shredded lettuce bed. Impressive. Thanks for the post.

This recipe was good but the chicken needed a little help. Here is what I did to add a little zing to the chicken.
1) Used store-prepared rotisserie chicken. Luckily I live in Miami where they make Mojo chicken, but most places sell Lemon Pepper, BBQ etc.  I like the whole chicken because you can have both white and dark meat.
2) Added 1 packet of Taco Seasoning and half cup of enchilada sauce
3) Added Sauteed green onion, yellow onion and garlic which I softened in a pan with butter.

I then placed the shredded chicken with all of the above and let all the flavors marry for an hour before placing it into the tortilla.

YUMMY!

Great Meal! My son wanted chimichangas for birthday meal and it was a hit. The 
tortilla's were pretty stuffed and just 1 filled me up and there were leftovers. They 
were just as good reheated. Thanks!

I was really excited about these & sad to say I was disappointed. The premise is good, but the end result is very bland. There needs to be more seasoning in the preparation of the chicken and the recipe in general. The guac needed lots of salt to taste good. I added a can of died green chilies to the rice mixture while cooking for color & flavor. Would make again with some tweaks, probably some chili powder, cumin, etc. in the whole recipe.

Very good. I made these for dinner tonight. The prep time is quite a bit longer, but thats ok, I expected it from the reviews. I baked at 400 for 20 minutes. I put cheddar cheese on the top of them for the last 8 minutes. Very yummy! Thanks!

These were  good.  Again, I used shredded rottisserie chicken meat instead of plain chicken breast.  The filling was tasty, as was the lightly fried tortillas.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  I have already had requests for the recipe.

Good recipe!  I loved chimichangas and these were good.  I think we would leave out the 
extra onions that are added before frying.  The rice was a little different twist but was
good.

These were good but didn't really have the wow factor I'd expect from a chimichanga.  And considering how fattening all that cheese is, I really want the wow.  And they are rather time consuming - no way these are done in 45 min.  I've never seen 12" tortillas but I calculated this would be about ten 9" ones... that allowed them to be good & stuffed like I like them.  I don't like cooked pieces of onion in (most) stuff so used liquid onion in the rice mixture, and no extra. I just dumped on top the stuff I liked and had around, which ended up being the cilanto, green onion, tomato, sour cream (the more sour cream the better!) & cheese.  These really do need "something" - at the local restaurant I shove the guacamole off and there's no onion or pepper, and they are delicious, so there's something missing in the way of spices or something.

This Receipe was great, especially the rice mixture, we loved it.  I did change it up a bit by leaving out the chicken. I used a fresh squeezed lime, in place of the lemon juice, and added just a little bit of salsa to the avocado mixture.  It was all very tasty once they were assembled together.  I may opt to bake the chimichangas next time instead of frying.  The fried tasted great of course, but I hate a smelly fried house for the next couple of day.  Thanks for the great recipe, will be making these often.

Good recipe, although I need a little more flavor with this one.  It was a little dry and even though we love guacamole, I wish there was some type of sauce that the chimi's could have been moistened with.  But overall, I believe we will have it again!

This was a yummy recipe, but I only gave it 4 stars because it was a little bit too much work in my opinion.  I think next time I will be super lazy and just not fry them.

Tasted wonderful, my family loved them, and they don't require too much time to make if you are able to prep beforehand.  I did have a little trouble with the guacamole part but the rest was great!

I served these at a wine and cheese party we had, with a mexican flair. I deep fried them instead of cooking them in a fry pan. They were the first things to go..Very tasty!!

The family loved it.  I basted them with butter and cooked in the oven at 400 for about 25 minutes.  I also pre-mixed the rice, beans, chicken and olives in the pot with the rice, which made the filling one step.  I used the big tortillas, which made for monster sized chimichangas.  Very satisfying (and stuffing) meal.  The ingredients as listed make a lot of filling.  I made 6 jumbo chimi's and have enough left over for another 6.  It took about an hour preparation.

These are the greatest! Like a lot of others, I also baked them instead of frying. They are better than some I've had at restaurants, and even better the next day!

Really good.  Family loved it.  I did bake them as others suggested to decrease calories, make healthier.  Added some enchilada sauce on bottom and top.  Really tasty.

So we baked these instead of frying them to cut calories. Also made these with Quorn Chickn' as we are vegetarians, but all I can say is WOW! The topping for these makes it taste like something out of an authentic Mexican restaurant, it was so good we've decided this will become part of our regular dinner rotation. 5 Stars and two HUGE thumbs up!!!!!!!!! *****

Really a four and a half. I didn't do the beans nor the topping and I accidentally picked up the green enchilada sauce and not the red but this still came out great! I'm doing it again and have shared with all I know. I baked it as suggested by other reviews

This was a great recipe and my husband loved it.  I used other reviewers comments and brushed a butter substitute on top and then baked them for 20 minutes at 400.  I didn't have the avacados, but sour cream was fine - I will be more prepared next time.  The shredded lettuce was the perfect touch.  Thanks for a delicious and easy dish!

The concept is a good one, but the recipe itself was bland. We baked them as another reviewer suggested and that was great (see other reviews for details). I would do again but add lots of mexican spices and season the chicken!!!!

Made these for the family last night. Everyone loved them and thought they were a great alternative to the boring taco's and burittos! Chimis are not regular fare in Australia - but it didnt take too much to convince my family - they love mexican food. I took some of the revies on board and baked mine in the oven rather than frying. Also omitted the olives - I love them, my family hates them. majority rules! Thanks for a nice change in the menu.

These were good, but I think all the flavor is in the topping. The filling was bland. I added some taco seasoning (from a recipe on this site) to give it more flavor. Maybe I shouldn't have used mild enchilada sauce. To make them easier to assemble, I mixed the rice, beans, cheese and chicken all together and then filled the tortillas using a large kitchen scoop. The whole family liked them, but agreed that the filling needed a little something. I will make them again but with more spice!

Thanks for the recipe! I did however change a few things to make it a little easier. First I put the chicken in a crock-pot with seasoning and peppers for 10 hours.  I used 8 chicken breast so I could make enchiladas also.  I used the Chicken Enchiladas I recipe for the chicken mixture. Then for the rice I used zatarans jambalaya rice mix. SO YUMMY and very easy to make. Then I layered as you stated but baked them over some salsa in my pan and covered in cheese. I baked give or take for about 20-30 minutes covered, then 5 min uncovered. Served it with cornbread and the left over rice mixture. I placed them over lettuce and topped with sour cream. This was a huge hit with my lovely husband, thanks so much, Rebecca.

This is a good recipe! I usually bake these and they are just as good. I scale down the ingredients though because it makes way more filling than you need. I have also made them with beef and they were wonderul that way as well. My kids love these! Thanks for a recipe my whole family enjoys!

A wonderful recipe, my housemates and I loved it.  We found we used a lot less chicken than the recipe suggested, and we think we'll try a different topping the next time around, perhaps something along the lines of enchilada sauce and cheese.  I would suggest putting some of the diced chili peppers  right in the chimichanga, for a bit more zazz.

The rice mixture part of the recipe is a real winner, and easy to make - great filling for anything in the taco/burrito genre.

I changed the recipe a little and it was awesome! I shredded the cooked chicken and added it to sauteed onions and 2-4 tbsp of enchilanda sauce. Then I layered the chix mixture, cheese and refried beans in a tortilla. Rolled them up and fried. I will be making this again soon!  This came out awesome!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe!!  I too live in Texas and think this is as authentic as they come.  Do to some time constraints i omitted black olives and refried beans.  I used chedder cheese (it's what i had in the refriderator).  This turned out great.  If you don't have time to make the topping, just add a little cheese on top along with some sour cream and you are in business.

I tried this recipe and loved it. However...... Instead of 1 1/2 cup of broth for the rice, I did 2 1/2 of chicken broth. 1 1/2 cup did not allow my rice to cook thoroughly. And the chicken deserved a pinch of salt. Also, the topping needs atleast another tbsp of cilantro.... Oh, and I skipped the olives. Other then that, it was great!

Easy and yummy!!  Used Ortega taco sauce mild instead of enchililada sauce and left out the olives.  Also used Minute Rice and followed package directions. Topped with sauce and sour cream.  Had refried beans with shredded cheese and sauce on the side.  Should have taken a photo.  Ate it up instead.

we both enjoyed this, but there was just way too much onion for me.. i cut the recipe in half and the filing was still enough for the full amount.. used chile verde sauce for the enchilada sauce and leftover grilled salt and pepper chicken breast.. didn't have the ingredients for the topping.. so we ate it straight up.. ty for the recipe

Love these! It takes some time to dice up the chicken, onions, etc and to wait for the rice to simmer, but so worth it.  The flavor combination is perfect! We don't usually even bother making the topping, but just serve them with sour cream and salsa, as they are fantastic as is!  Restaurant quality!

My family liked this recipe.  I seasoned the chicken and rice with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin yo ensure that it had flavor.  In addition, I buttered and baked it versus frying. I would definitely make it again; but it is a lot of work.

This recipe is great. To speed things up I mixed all the filling ingredients, except the refried beans, together and that made it easier to fill the tortillas. The refried beans I smeared on the tortilla before adding the rest of the filling. I thought the filling tasted bland at first, but after putting the whole meal together it was perfect. I did make the guacamole and served a generous dollop of it on a bed of shredded lettuce with a dollop of sour cream and a dollop of salsa next to it. Like other reviewers, I rubbed olive oil on the chimichangas and baked them in the oven at 375 degrees until they were hot and golden. Then I placed them on the bed of lettuce. Any extra enchilada sauce got poured on them before baking. 
This recipe is a keeper!

This was a good "start" recipe.  While I kept the topping ingredients the same (except omitting the peppers and adding a few packets of hot sauce from Taco Time), I tinkered with the actually stuffing of the Chimichangas.

Although not that much, instead of refried beans I added a drained can of black beans, as well as a drained can of mexicorn. The cooking on the stove was the same, I did add the chicken to the cooked ingredients after the simmering was done, also added some pepperjack/cheddar cheese and about a 1/4 cup of the remaining enchilada sauce, mixed it all together and then after spooning into the taco shell added a bit more monterey jack cheese and then folded up.

As for cooking, after reading some some reviews, I put toothpicks (1 at each end and 1 in the middle). "flash fried" 1 at a time, and then put them on a baking sheet covered w/sprayed foil. I then brushed melted butter over the top, added a sprinkling of sea salt and baked in 375 oven for about 20-25 min, or until golden brown.  I used this method because they still have the deep fried taste and appearance, but if you are serving a crowd they will all be done at the same time.

I served it on the bed of lettuce, a small bit of the topping then the chimi on top & more topping & sour cream, actually forgot the final sprinkling of cheese, didnt miss it, but I'm sure would also be good.

It was a hit with my family, especially my "Farmer John" son. as well as my 18 year old growing basketball player son.

I thought these were delicious.  The fried tortillas around the melted cheese, rice, chicken and beans was delish!  I actually didn't have some of the ingredients so improvised with great results.  First, no jack cheese, used mozz, was excellent.  No enchilada sauce, used tapito but only a few drops for a hint of heat.  Last, I didn't have any of the topping ingredients except shredded cheddar and sour cream so I skipped that this time, but I will definitely make it next time.  It is obvious that this recipe was written by someone who really knows Mexican food.

Absolutely amazing! I have to say though, this recipe is LABOR INTENSIVE. There are a lot of parts to prepare, and then the frying in oil takes time (since I could only do one at a time) and it was one heck of a mess. In my opinion, what really makes this meal in the guacamole/salsa that you make with it. The only change I made was adding a packet of taco seasoning to the rice.

Instead of rolling... I layered so I had a chimi lasagna.  I omitted olives because my husband dislikes them and I added a can of green chilies.  Also, use the recipe from the site for Refried Beans Without the Refry... excellent.  Make them the day before for a meal, then use them again in this recipe!

This was very good! I followed a lot of the other reviews- I spread on butter and baked them for 20 minutes at 350 F instead of frying them. Also when I cooked my chicken I added taco seasoning, salsa, and left over enchilada sauce. It was DELICIOUS!I served with rice and beans.

This was great. As we all do...I customized to taste and what I had avail. I used taco sauce rather than enchilada since that is what I had. Best mexican rice I have ever made. Used less chicken and more beans and rice instead. Also baked at 400 rather than fry. At the end I put a little slice of queso quesadilla cheese on each chimi. and cooked for maybe 5 minutes more to allow the cheese to melt. Absolutely wonderful!

This is the first recipe I have gotten off here that I was not impressed with.  I consider myself a fantastic cook, but something went wrong with this.  Rice - followed directions and turned out under cooked and dry. To make them more restaurant style, suggest using larger then 12" tortilla shells so you can put more chicken in them.  Had much higher expections when I started.

They were good and easy to make but were very bland. I also baked them instead of frying them as posted by other reviewers b/c I don't like greasy foods. I think the next time I make this, I will add taco seasoning to my chicken.

The flavor was great, and the filling was very plentiful!  I gave 4 stars because the directions were not that clear for a beginner.  It says to divide a few ingredients, but never instructs what to do with them once they're halved.

This was fabulous and extremely easy to make! As with other reviewers I baked the Chimichangas at 400 degrees instead of frying it. I also opted to do the highly rated guacamole recipe on this site instead of the avocado mix above. Will definitely make again!

These were ok.  They were kind of bland for my taste.  I think if the chicken was cooked with some spices that would help.  I might try again spicing the chicken up.

i forgot to look at recipe while cooking, lol, but i satueed chicken in oil with greenpeppers and onions, seasoned it with cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper. add zatarans jumbalaya rice mix, water on back of package, black beans rinsed and drained, mccormick enchilada sauce seasoning packet, 1 1/2 cups of water, and a can of enchilada sauce. i rolled them up with refried bean/cheesy tortillas, drizzled evoo and loaded them with cheese on top. cooked for 15 min on 350, served with homade quac, pace salsa, and sour cream. they had just enough of a kick but not to much to ruin the taste, and thats a compliment from me since i hate spicy foods. thanks for the orignal recipe though, i just like mine better. i'll try yours one day ;)

Excellent!  By the previous reviews, I also decided to bake at 400 for 25 minutes.  They came out nice and crispy, and they were a hit for Super Bowl Sunday.  This is certainly a keeper!

We absolutely love this recipe.  It takes time and lots of dishes, but good food is worth it!  I cook my chicken in enchilada sauce, and rather than using canned, I have discovered the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce on this site to be much more flavorful.  
My children love this too, although they prefer when I use small tortillas and simply fold them in half and fry them that way.  It's probably just the novelty of eating with their hands rather than using forks. :^)
As others have noted, this makes far more than six...something more like twice that.  Our family (two adults and three smallish children) gets two meals from this.  But we don't mind.  The more the better!

I made these for company and everyone enjoyed them.  I baked them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  I used homemade red enchilada sauce (from this website) and drizzled some over the top of the chimichangas.  I didn't make the topping and instead let everyone choose what they wanted to add on top (sour cream, cheese, lettuce, etc.).

These turned out really well! I baked, rather than fried them, brushing the smaller "soft-taco size" flour tortillas with EVOO as I heated them in a skillet; spread them with refried beans (like you would butter), topped beans with cheese & other filling ingredients, & baked at 400F for 30minutes in a baking dish sprayed with cooking spray. The tortillas browned top & bottom. Topped these with the avocado salsa included in the recipe, as well as with sour cream & "Garden Tomato Salsa", also from this website.  The rice filling for this was great & would stand on its own as a nice side for a Mexican meal; I did add a sprinkling of "Taco Seasoning I" mix (from this website) to the rice.  I did have lots of leftover fillings, so I used it all up in the extra tortillas I ended up with, didn't bake those, but froze them to thaw later and bake for another great meal.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe, Rebecca!

UMM UMM UMM! We had HAPPY BELLIES all over my couches after this meal. They were quick to make, not expensive at all because you have almost everything in your kitchen already anyway. This quick, tasty dish is now a family favorite! Thank you for sharing!

These were good, but the proportions on the ingredients were WAYYYY off for us.  We only used a quarter of the refried beans, half of the cheese, and a quarter of the rice.  We also had TOO much sauce.

We enjoyed this dish a lot but would really like to see someone else make it to see where we went wrong.

Although I would give this recipe 4 stars as written, with a few adjustments it made for a really outstanding meal. For a start, I marinaded the chicken in a little lime juice and freshly-ground black pepper. I also added some chili powder, fresh snipped cilantro, and ground cumin to the rice mixture. Husband absolutely LOVED it! Thanks so much, Rebecca! (PS Like most people, I try to avoid needless calories when I can, but for that delicious chimichanga flavor, you really must fry these! It's so worth the splurge!)

This recipe needed tweeking a bit but it is a good place to start if you want Chimichangas to become a family favorite.  We reduced the amount of rice in each chimi and changed the sauce to a white cheese sauce.

GREAT! I was surprised how well these turned out.  I put diced chili peppers in the chimichanga, deep fried them and used enchilada sauce for topping. Very Yummy!  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks.

Great easy to do, would be great if your having a fiesta most of the work could be done ahead of time. I do agree with others about spicing the chicken up a bit, next time I will try adding some enchilada sauce  to it.Also I suggest doubling the rice and refried beans and use them for your side dishes.Will also try to bake them as others have suggested, next time just to see which way is better. A+A+A+A+ MUST TRY.

Excellent. We leave out the rice and to make it quick use white cheese sauce drizzled over the top instead of the avocado topping. Mmmm.

I made a few changes in this to suit us but it was soooo good!  Used about 1/4 cup Rotel tomatoes and 1 tsp. cumin instead of enchilada sauce in the rice because that was what I had.  We don't "fry" foods so instead after rolling the chimichangas I brushed the outside with olive oil then placed them on a baking sheet and baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes until tortilla was lightly browned.  Also didn't make the avocado sauce because husband doesn't like it.  Just served them with traditional taco toppings including diced avocado, cilantro and sliced olives so we could each put on what we wanted.  These were a bit of a mess to make but boy were they worth it!!  Will definitely make again!

This is an awesome Chimi recipe-there is plenty of room for seasoning, the rice mixture really makes it. I spiced it up a little and put in a little more broth.

The first time I tried this recipe, I had only small size tortillas.  So, we just cut them up the size of chips and fried them up.  Served the rest of the stuff on the side and it was still a hit!

Loved this recipe. The only thing I'd do differently is add the olives to the rice when simmering. Can't say how the guacamole was cause I didn't make that.

This recipe was amazing. I did however bake the chimis at 400 for 20 minutes. I didnt have enchalada sauce. Therefore, I thought I would try using what I had in the fridge good ol' tapito. Tapito wasn't a good sub. But the recipe itself as fabulous! I fought through my over seasoning. I will try again minus the tapito

This worked well for my family. I had to use some shortcut methods, like pre-cooked rice, and modified it to fit my time schedule. Overall, its an easy recipe for families on short time.

This was so delish.  My husband loved it.  Didn't amke the avacado topping, I used a queso topping and it tasted so good.  I also added some bell peppers and yellow peppers to the rice with my leftover chicken broth from baking my chicken.  It was very good.

I love recipes like these because you can substitute what ingredients you like or dislike. I browned up some chorizo to go in these with sauteed peppers and onions. Fantastic. My husband requests these once a month now.

Great!  My family loved these.  Chicken was a little bland by itself.  I just added a little mexican blend seasoning.  The cheese is definitely the key!

This chimichanga is as good as any restaurant version I've ever enjoyed (and there have been quite a few).  I used left over mexican rice in the filling, placed the rolled tortillas in a greased 9x13 casserole/cake pan, brushed them with melted butter, and baked them in the oven at 350 until they were golden brown.  I topped them with guacamole and sour cream (instead of making the topping) and they were awesome.  I will absolutely make them again.  Thank you!!!

These don't have very much flavor as a stand-alone chimi. I didn't make the topping but maybe it's needed to make these tasty.

Really good. Would prefer to have more flavor inside, but it is a great mild flavor for children. My three year old and my three year old niece devoured them.

These were ok. Since others made comments about them being bland, I added some garlic powder to the rice mixture and simmered the chicken in taco seasoning. I still found them to be rather bland. Still, they were not as difficult to make as some said. Just make sure you tuck the ends in and fry them on med high. I used tongs to turn them to make sure that little flap didn't open up.

This was great! I changed a few things...I used black beans instead of refried beans and I did the rice on the side instead of inside the chimichanga. I cooked the onions and bell peppers with the chicken,and after I fried  them I melted  monterey jack on top and had guacamole on the side.I will definitly be making again!

Very easy.  Rice was a little bland so I added salt.  Used rotisserie chicken and black beans.  Also added sauteed onions, green peppers and cilantro.  Brushed with canola oil and baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 min. as others suggested.  Family loved them.

I loved these! I cooked them in my deep fryer and they turned out beautifully.  The only thing I did different is use 2 cans of chicken instead of cooking the chicken myself and instead of cheddar I topped with crumbled queso fresco.  I also used my own mexican rice recipe.

Very good recipe!  I used the salsa that is posted on the "Black Bean Huevos Rancheros" Also, use the big tortillas!  I just had the small on hand and thought I would make it work.  Yeah, not so much, they are a pain to keep together when they're so small.

These are a family favorite! I have been making them for several years and they always turn out fantastic. I usually grill the chicken, which adds a nice smoky note to the background. I definately recommend this!

Very good! We did not make the topping and the rice needed to be cooked longer (about 30 minutes) but this is one of our favorites.  A good idea is to make the chicken and rice the night before and then put it together in no time.  We also bake it to make it healthier.  Has become a standard in our house.

I loved this recipe! To save time I used salsa and sour cream rather than make the topping, but when I have more time I will definitely try the topping in the recipe. My extremely picky 14 year old son loved this as well. This one is a keeper!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! I omitted the olives and the topping, using the advice of another viewer (with salsa and sour cream). I also used the enchilada sauce recipe from this site as well. That was good. Overall they were very tasty. Word of advice: Rolling can be difficult! Make sure that the tortillas are hot before/during rolling so they don't crack!

These were very tasty. I only had the taco sized tortillas, but it still worked out. I added 2 Tblspn of chile powerd and 1/2 tsp of cumin to the shredded chicken, as I thought it was going to be a bit bland. I tried a couple reader's suggestions and baked some of them. Maybe they would've tasted good had I not already ate one that was fried - they can't compare! My suggestion: fry them, enjoy your dinner, and work out the next day :)

Both my husband and I liked the recipe, but my daughter didn't care for it. The rice I had to add more broth to and a added a 10 oz can of red chili sauce instead of enchilada sauce. It is a time consuming recipe so be prepared. Thanks for the great recipe!

These chimichangas were really good! Although the topping took a teeny bit extra time, taste-wise it was worth it and it added a nice color to the meal. Before cooking my chicken, I seasoned it really good with various seasonings so that the meat would not be bland and added a little salt and garlic powder to my rice. I think the next time I make these I will use ground turkey instead of the shredded chicken for variation.

Pretty good! I used a rotisserie chicken I bought precooked and that cut down on prep time. I just thought it was bland. It could have used some spice.

The stuffing was not that flavorful wich is important as my family isnt big into any of the toppings. I brushed with butter olive oil and baked. Its was decent but not nearly up to my calibur of cooking. I wont attempt again.

The first time I cooked these I baked them and we weren't that thrilled with the taste. So when I took the rest out of the freezer I decided to see if frying would change the flavour and it did. Actually, I fried and baked them. I first fried them in a hot skillet before transferring them to a pan, sprinkling with cheese and baking for 15 minutes at 350. They were great! Will definitely make again.

I didn’t fry these, instead I baked them. I didn’t exactly time it, just waited till they looked crisped on both sides, turning halfway in the middle of the baking time. I always have problems with frying tortillas, I probably don’t have the right pan to do so. I served this alongside a Spanish rice box mix & a fruit salad made with pineapples, strawberries, kiwis, mangoes, and peaches.

Absolutely delicious! We bake them instead of frying and they are   still wonderful! Add a little guacamole and sour cream and you are set to go with a delicious meal!

This was really good, but I had a couple of problems. My tortillas wouldn't close b/c they were too full. I had a lot of ingredients leftover  too. Next time I will have more tortillas so I don't have to overstuff the tortillas and so I don't have to throw away the left over stuffing that wouldn't fit in the tortillas. I ended up baking them b/c they were just too full to fry. So, if you're gonna make this either cut the ingredients down or use more tortillas.

Delicious! I baked also instead of frying (400 x 25 as suggested by other). The avocado topping makes the dish. Agree the ingredient list was a bit excessive (as in too much of everything left after stuffing the tortillas). Will half rice mixture next time and only needed 1 can refried beans. Used "Dee's Roast Pork for Tacos" recipe instead of the chicken. Thanks for sharing!

These were wonderful, but will only make for special functions due to the high calorie intake being so high, calorie intake would probably go down some if not using the avocados.

I've tried this with both green enchilada sauce and red, and I liked the green better. I always use La Costena refrieds. I use my own guac recipe to top the chimichangas, and I also top with Herdez green salsa and a little more cheese. We love these.

This recipe, by far, surpasses the receipe that I've regularly used in the past for Chimichangas! I used calrose rice, which I "browned" (a technique used in making Mexican rice, which gives you a less mushy consistency) in 3 tbsp of oil before adding the broth and onions. When done, I mixed together the rice, chicken, olives and refried beans before placing them in the tortillas.. I left the extra amount of onion (1/2 onion) out, as I felt the rice had plenty. I filled the tortillas with the mixture, sprinkled it with cheese (I used a Mexican four cheese blend) and then rolled. I decided to skip the topping recipe - I just placed the fried chimichangas on top of a bed of lettuce, spooned them with warm red enchilada sauce and garnished with a dollop of sour cream. My guests were very impressed with the taste - and presentation. I served these along with Mexican beans (pinto) - which made the meal complete!

I made some slight changes, instead of cubed chicken i shredded the chicken (only cause i have never had chicken chimis that was cubed so it seemed a bit weird, im from AZ so maybe they do things different). And to give the chicken filling flavor i just cooked it with hot enchilada sauce. And with the changes i made these came out AWESOME, that everybody raves about.

These were incredible!  But they did need a little tweaking. First, the chicken needs some zing. I cut up the chicken and pan cooked it with taco seasoning then shredded when done.  Once chimi's are filled and rolled, brush them with oil and baked turning every five minutes until done!  Yumm!!!

I made this for lunch after my daughters baptism for all the in-laws. They loved it.  I did follow some earlier comments & topped it with a red enchilada sauce since no one in the family (besides me) likes guacamole.

It's a good base to start from to make your own recipe, but a lot of the stuff in it is extremely wrong. Just to warn you, you will have to do a lot of modifying. And I mean a lot. 

For example it says you'll need 6 tortillas. Yeah right! I was using the big, burrito sized tortillas, the biggest at all the stores I go to, and this recipe makes at least TWENTY! You'll also need about double the amount of chicken broth they say for the rice to be done. I recommend using half the amount of everything but the chicken, and use 3 cups of chicken instead of 2.

Prep time is way understated on this recipe, at least double the time. Chicken could have used more seasoning as the overall  chimi was a little bland, even with the avocado sauce. Still pretty good.

Also— people’s ideas vary in the different parts of the states when it comes to Mexican food. I’m in Texas and we do texmex. I used this recipe as a base mostly and tweaked it.

YUM!!! I made a couple of personal changes... no olives as such, but this was delish and so easy to make. I only fried for a  few minutes to 'seal' the tortilla then baked in the oven at 350 for about 15-20 min. Second time I didn't even fry the seal and it held together very well. Will def make again!!!

I made the filling exactly as recipe. Topping was modified according to my families tastes. Sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, and olives. Next time I will try the Avocado topping for myself. 
I mixed the shredded  chicken with the rice mixture. It kept the chicken from drying out. Layered it as recommended. I fried it  lightly in the pan. My family loved it.

20 minute prep time...lol...I was in the kitchen forever.....the proportions are way off...had enough rice to feed a family of 12.....be sure to buy huge tortilla's....Not a very authentic Mexican dish...blando!  needs some heat!  the 'mashed avocado sauce...I guess, is an attempt at making pico de gallo....find a good pico recipe elsewhere....otherwise..what a great recipe!

Time consuming if you're not prepared by cooking meats the day before. I substituted chicken for Porkloin prepared the night before then shredded and re-heated in a skillet before filling. But my goodness they were amazing and fun to make.

Good recipe, but tried to make a little healthier. Ended up using low salt broth and anything else I could find in the low salt variety.. Instead of frying them, I baked them until browned using some spray to coat the pan. Turned out pretty good!

I added green pepper to the rice mix and after the rice set up- also added the rest of the can of enchilada sauce. I added some garlic powder too. I tasted it before rolling them up and the mix is SO good! This recipe makes ALOT. It made 10 huge chimichangas. I took the advice from other suscribers and am baking it right now in the oven! Can wait to try it with all the fixings! :) Yum!

Y U M M Y ! ! !  Didn't use olives, don't like them.  Didn't use jalepenos, don't like them.  This was one of the best dinners ever.

Great recipe. I modified a couple of things: 

1. I am currently obsessed with my pressure cooker, so I prepared the chicken, broth, enchilada sauce, and onions in it. I also added a little cumin and cilantro in the mix. When it was done, I shredded the chicken instead of cubed.

2. I used Spanish rice instead of just white for more flavor.

3. I left out the olives - ick!

4. I baked this instead of fried. About 20 min on 400.

5. I substituted all dairy for non-dairy versions because of allergies. Just as good!

I'm Chicana and never thought of making my "chimi's" like this. But I have to tell you...I received so many compliments recently during a Sunday Football game. The chimi's taste so much better when paired with guacamole.

SOOOOOO good! yes, the portions were off a little but this was a lot better then going to an 'americanized' mexican restaurant and eating chimichangas that are just topped with enchilada sauce and cheese.

Got rave reviews for this one.  I didn't put the rice inside the chimi but served it on the side.  I also used quite a bit more oil to fry them in, other than the 1/4 cup the recipe calls for. Yum, yum, yum.

FANTASTIC!  These turned out superb!  The chimi's were relatively quick and quite easy to make.  My husband was really impressed with my "presentation" with the chimi's resting on a bed of lettuce with the pretty avocado-tomato salsa on top.

Perfect chimichanga recipe!  It still needed some sauce to go on top though.  Next time will add mexican white cheese sauce.

Yummy. I followed others' recommendations and added taco seasoning to the chicken. I also topped the chimichangas with enchilada sauce. Turned out very well, but very rich and filling.

These chimichangas were awesome!  However, I found that they were not nearly as fattening as the nutrition guide said they were.  We ate them for 3 days straight!

Delicious!!! My husband always orders chimis at our favorite Mexican restaurant and said that these were just as good. I didn't make the avocado suace, though. I mashed some avocado, added some hot salsa and a little garlic powder and called it guacamole! It worked very well. One tip though... do not overfill the tortillas or they will be impossible to fold and fry. I think next time I will use extra large tortillas to avoid the same problem. These were very authentic and I will definately be making these again! Thanks!

Very tasty! The rice mixture took a little longer than expected, but it was well worth the wait!

We enjoyed this but thought it needed a little more something.  I will make this again adding garlic powder to the rice and season the chicken with some Fiesta Fajita Seasoning.  Thanks Rebecca.
