I've made this twice now, and if you use any fat-free ingredients it won't set up properly - BUT - we've found it is even more delicous frozen! The frozen texture is terrific. Next time I'll add more lemonade (I used Minute Maid) because I love the flavor.

Not very good too bland and not enough tart.  I took 5 lemon pies to a party of "lemon lovers" and there was still half of this pie leftover, doesn't say much for the pie.

Good and easy recipe.  The lemon flavor was a little tart.  I would sweeten it a little bit if I were to make it again.  It is a keeper though.

This pie was a snap to make!  I only got one piece because my husband loved it so much. Just be careful to use a lemonade that isn't too tart.

This was a solid recipe that we enjoyed.  Cool and refreshing.  It would lend itself well to tweaking with other concentrates and pudding flavors.

This is a wonderful recipe and truly is refreshing on a hot day!  I do, however, agree with another reviewer in that it was a bit tart.  My husband didn't like it as much because of that, but I still thought it was very tasty.

This was so light and refreshing!  It is the easiest pie I've ever made, and is very quick to prepare.  The only problem I had was that after 8 hours, it still had not set completely, but it could be something I did.

I have made this several times over the years. It is a light, refreshing lemon pie. Very easy to make. I usually double the recipe and make two for holiday meals. This is great for Easter or any warm weather occasion. Good with a shortbread crust also.

Very good pie. Refreshing lemon flavor and simple to make. My husband stood there stirring, while I gathered and dropped in the ingredients. It did make too much for 1 pie crust though. We could have filled two crusts but chose to dip graham crackers and vanilla wafers in the filling that was left. Yummy!
