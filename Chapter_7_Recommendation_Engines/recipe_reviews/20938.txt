a very simple and delicious gravy.  However, you do have to prepare this in a certain order.  First, use half the butter to sautee the onions until transluscent.  Add the other half of the butter then the flour to make the roux.  The best way to make a good roux is to use a whisk.  Then, add the water and beef bouillon and continue to whisk until desired color and consistency.  If the onions are finely chopped and cooked for the right amount of time, you don't even notice them in the gravy - they just melt away.

Good recipe, but like the others I changed the way I made it, not the ingredients I used.
I sauteed the onion in the butter first, then I added the flour to make a roux.  I browned the roux to give my gravy some color.  Then I added the bouillion and the water.  I used to 2 packets of beef boullion in mine, which I scaled for 2 people.  Worked out well and tastes great!

What a wonderful, easy way to make gravy!  It is especially nice to make with something like meatloaf, when you may not have beef drippings immediately available.  I used 2 cups water to four boullion cubes, which worked perfectly.  Added black pepper to taste, along with some Worcestershire for color and flavor.  Make sure you make the roux first (cook the butter and flour together) so it will start to brown, then add the onions and the other ingredients.

Very tasty but suggest the following: was too salty so I diluted it with more water; directions didn't indicate any particular way to put together so make sure you do so in this order to avoid lumps: melt butter, add flour and onion, mix together boullion and water and add to flour & butter mixture stirring constantly over medium high heat.

Excellent after making a few changes!
 I like our gravy "browned" as it is in the packets you buy at the store. I put the flour in a hot saucepan and stirred it on medium heat until medium brown (don't burn!). In a seperate sauce pan I heated the butter and sauteed the onions until soft, then added the flour and 2 packets of bouillon. Adding the water slowly and whisking constantly stops it from sticking.

I have always tried making a good gravy and this was wonderful. Very easy and very tasty. I will always use this recipe from now on. Just like the other reviews melt butter, add flour then onion then mix together the boullion and the water and then pour with the butter mixture and only use 2 cups of water and 4 bouillons and you won't be disappointed with the results.
Thank you very much we all enjoy this wonderful gravy.

Excellent and easy gravy.  Onions are key to the flavor.  Best to saute the onions in the butter and then use Wondra flour which mixes quickly without lumps to make a roux.  Then add the broth and cook to thicken.  I used canned beef broth and it came out fantastic for Christmas dinner.

This gravy was fabulous! I didn't have an onion so I used one tablespoon of onion powder. I took advice from other poster's reviews and made a roux. I also used 2 cups of water for four bouillon cubes. I could see that the gravy was going to be pretty light in color, so I added a little bit of Kitchen Bouquet to reach my desired color. The flavor, thickness, and color were all wonderful. I'll definitely be using this recipe again, of course with my own adjustments.

This is a very easy recipe for gravy.  I don't add quite a whole onion, maybe a 1/4 of a large one.  The only variations I used was a can of beef broth, and no boullion or water.  I've also added 1/3 cup sour cream to the gravy to pour over Weinerschnizel.

I made this gravy recipe with chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon and it was great.  Serve on top of roasted chicken and mashed potatoes with corn on the cob and biscuits on the side.  YUM!!

This was fantastic!  I used reconstituted instant minced onion instead of fresh because my son has a thing about onions.  I also substituted a nice cabernet instead of 1/3 of the water.  My son came back for seconds AND thirds!  This is very easy to make and tastes great.  Thanks!

Overall very good but I had to doctor it up a bit.  Because I have to watch sodium in my diet, I used low-sodium bouillon and no-salt butter.  Cuts the sodium down from 2,700 + mgs. to about 15 mgs.  Because I was using a slow cooker, I doubled the recipe, cooking on the stove top first, then added a jar of beef gravy (this should take care of the lack of salt flavor) but found I had the opposite problem of the previous reviewer.  It was way too thin.  I sprinkled several Tbsp. of  corn starch and that seemed to take care of the problem.  I added about 1-1/4 lbs. of cubed beef and slow-cooked for several hours, then served over mashed potatoes. Delicious!

Delicious. I followed another reviewers advice and sauteed onion in butter first until tender, then i whisked flour in to make roux. Then water and bouillon. I used about 2 1/2 cups water though because gravy too thick. Even my picky son loves it. Thank you for recipe Sal!

Outstanding! I doubled the recipe. Used beef broth in place of water and 2 bouillon cubes. Sauteed 1/2 cup finely chopped onion in half the butter.  Then added remaining butter and flour to make a roux as stated by other reviewers. I did salt and pepper to taste.  Will make again and again! This has been printed and added to my recipe book of favorites.  Thanks Sal.

I am on a special diet and made some simple changes to reduce the salt.  Like many others I sautéed the onions but in coconut oil instead of butter (Coconut oil helps reduce cholesterol).  I then made the roux with the flour.  Instead of bullion I used beef base to reduce the salt.  For added flavor I added some burgundy powder I found at my local spice store.

This was great! I needed gravy for my beef and noodles and this was it. I sauteed the onion in butter, added flour to brown just as the others suggested, but I used 1 1/2 cup broth from the roast in place of the water- PERFECT!

This was very good gravy. I made it the way inguri suggested. My girlfriend added some gravy master to the mix though. She's always stepping on my toes, nothing I do is good enough for her.

For the life of me I can't figure out why some people's photos show white gravy!  I made this because I made a roast and didn't have any beef broth or very many drippings to use for the rue.  I followed the suggestion to brown the onion first and using my microplane (food rasp) to make sure the onions were fine enough and they definitely were. I added three cups of water and four bouillon cubes as another reviewer suggested and let that come to a boil while creating the rue in a small saucepan.  If you let the butter and flour get really browned up that will add color to your gravy, as will the bouillon cubes.  I added the rue to the broth, whisked it up to make sure there were no lumps and left it boiling on the stove for about 15 minutes so it would cook down.    I also eventually added a few tablespoons of drippings from my roast, which I'm sure added a great flavor, but even without it I think this gravy is pretty solid.  (Solid in quality, not in viscosity.)

Awesome... I did chop the onions as small as I could and sauted them in the butter then added the flour and then the boullion/water mix.  Turned out better than my family's passed down recipe.

What an AMAZING recipe!  I made this last week following the directions to the "t".  I was amazed at how simple it was to make with all the ingredients I had on hand.  This week I changed the bouillon from beef to chicken and it was just as amazing.  Next week is Thanksgiving and I must find some turkey bouillon!  There is never enough gravy for leftovers.  This year will be different!  Thank you Sal for sharing your AMAZING recipe and wishing you the best for the holidays!

For what it is, 5 stars.  I did saute the onion in about 1 T of the butter and then melted the rest, added the flour, water and used beef base.

Pretty good.  I may cut back on the flour by about a tablespoon next time though.  My 7-year-old daughter loved it on her mashed potatoes.

Nice recipe to have in your file. I thought I had some beef bouillon in the cupboard but, there I go thinking again! I used a can of beef broth and half of a large onion and followed the recipe. My guest really loved it! I made this to go with the Meatloaf Cordon Bleu from this site and it was a great pairing of flavors. Next time I would use the beef broth plus 1 or 2 tsp of bouillon for a richer beef taste.

Used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of the butter and it was really good.  Will use this when I need a gravy and don't have enough drippings.

Wow, great recipe! I followed other suggestions of cooking the butter and flour together first after the first batch didn't turn out. I used garlic powder and onion powder for taste and also a bit of Worchestershire (spelling?) sauce.

Although I think this recipe would be awesome as is, some minor tweaks ensured I'll never buy prepared beef gravy again.  I cut back the water to 1-1/4 cup, cut the onion back to about 1/4 of a large onion and stirred in 1/3 cup of sour cream after thickening.  Served with pot roast and vegy's.  Delicious and very quick and easy!

This is simple, but definitely not a gravy as listed. I made a meatloaf and had no meat drippings, so I was looking for a quick subtitute gravy. Based on the cook temperature and the ingredients it ends up as flour thickened hard onions. I did only half the onion as it seemed like quite a bit, but that wouldn't change the texture. To thin it out I had to adjust it by adding quite a bit more water and then simmering on (low) until the onions had time to soften. It worked, we ate it, but it was only acceptable and I found it to be extrememly salty.

As far as color for any beef based dishes I've always relied on a product available in most all food stores...Kitchen Bouquet. It's what my Mom always used and adds some taste and rich color to beef based dinners. Takes very little.  Use it also when I cook a roast and spread over outside of meat before cooking.

Calling all GRAVY CHALLENGED cooks!  This one is for US!!!!!  Easy, good, and fool proof.  No lumps!  Follow the recipe....dump all of the ingredients in a pan, heat over med heat until it boils and thickens.  I didn't add onion....didn't have one....so I tasted and seasoned as I went along.  Think I used a little onion salt, pepper, and a wee splotch of worcestershire sauce.  Thank you, SAL....great recipe!

I can't believe how delicious this gravy is!  I made it two nights in a row.  I used 1 1/2 cups water, 3 beef bouillon cubes, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter and pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to taste.  Very good considering the ease of preparation.  I like mine over rice with a beef patty.  A few shakes of Worchestershire sauce in the gravy adds a nice richness as well.

This just didn't work for us at all. I followed the recipe, but using the classic roux method. My husband asked "where's the beef?". This tasted to me like a canned onion gravy. He did say it was ok over mashed potatoes, but asked me not to make it again.

Very good taste!  We served it over hamburger patties and rice.  The only thing I changed was that I used dehydrated onions about 4 tbsp instead on fresh cut onion which softened nicely.

If you don't like crunchy onions in your gravy, saute' them beforehand. Also, I combined a cup of hot water with a cube of beef bullion, chilled it, mixed the flour into the cold broth, then added the butter (which i melted in the microwave beforehand) and the pre-sautéed chopped onion. I also ended up adding a decent amount of salt (but i have a salty pallet) and some black pepper as well. I then microwaved that uncovered for 30 seconds, stirred it, and microwaved another 30 seconds, stirred once more, and let it go another 30 to bring it up to temperature. So quick and easy, and very tasty!

What a great recipe!  I made this exactly as written, (only using one bouillon cube per teaspoon of bouillon) and it turned out super.  I used this on a steak pot pie (adapted from the Leftover Pot Pie from this site) and everyone loved it.    I have also substituted chicken bouillon for beef and it was just as good.   Great recipe.

in a pinch...and a very grateful for this recipe. I made a roux with the butter/flour and then slowly added beef broth instead of bouillon.  Was not salty and had the consistency of canned gravy (thick). The only downside is it isn't very beefy.

Just made this gravy and it was WAY better than I expected!  I made a meatloaf using the Lipton Onion Mushroom soup mix, except I use real pieces of ripped up bread instead of bread crumbs. Then I followed advice from others here and used beef broth for gravy rather than water and buillion. I cooked onions in butter, then made the roue by adding remainder of butter and the flour.  I added the beef broth and pan drippings from the meatloaf to roue. I used some of the beef broth from the can and mixed with flour, then added that to gravy to further thicken it. I added a little Worchestershire, salt, pepper, and dash of onion powder. Wonderful! Will make with meatloaf from now on. Had hot meatloaf sandwiches and mashed potatoes and even my 7 year old loved it! Thank You!

crunchy and flour-y.  Read reviews before making this!  But I like that I had all the ingredients on hand.  It will work in a pinch but I'd never serve it to anyone.  I think the order you cook it would make a big difference.  Next time I'll definitely make sure the onion is cooked before adding flour and water.

Personally, I didnt like this recipe (almost) as is. I dont do onions, so I used onion powder. And oddly enough, although it had tons of flavor, it seemed bland. So maybe next time I'll add some garlic or seasoned salt. Maybe add some kind of meat drippings too. I know it's strange to say that it has flavor but it's bland, but that's the only way I can think to describe it. SUPER easy to make, I personally just think it's missing something.

I made this recipe to include into a Swiss Steak recipe that called for jar gravy. I had all the ingredients so I just made it from scratch instead of buying it. It turned out great. I loved the taste. I will make this again for other dishes!

Very tasty gravy.  I normally just use butter/margarine on my mashed potatoes since I am not a big gravy fan.  But I couldn't get enough of this!  I just threw everything in a pan (didn't read the reviews that said to make a roux first) and it turned out just fine.  Ran it through a strainer though to take out the onion pieces, the flavor is enough without having to eat the pieces too.  I also would suggest using a very small onion.

I loved this gravy!! It was so good and I will for sure make it again. It was pretty thick...but still deserves 5 stars.

Basics are best. I use this recipe quite often because I don't really like the packets. (only use them when it is hubby's turn to cook).  I reduce the amount of onion just a little because it was too strong the first time.  Thanks for the post.

This was not what I was looking for. I like beef gravy that looks like beef gravy (dark brown) and not like chicken gravy. Also, the flavor was off, too salty.

Quite good, as long as you do the onions, butter, and flour first and then add the other ingredients. I also added a little  meat juice from the meatloaf I made, and it came out yummy!

Better than canned gravy but of course it can't compare to gravy made from meat drippings. If I make this again I'm going to try adding some spices. It needs more than just the onions.

Gravy was very quick to make and was very easy!  However, the end was result was very salty, maybe add a little less bouillon.  For two people, cut the recipe in half.  I also had to add a little more water because it was so thick.  I will make again with these changes.

Perfect. I didn't use onions. I made a roux with the butter and flour then added the beef broth. Wonderful with meatloaf and mashed potatoes.

Used the "bones" of this recipe this evening.  I am not a fan of bullion and used beef broth instead.  Sauteed the onions in the butter, added beef broth to the flour and mixed very well.  Put broth in with the sauteed onions, added the flour mix and as I was taught by my polish grandmother-in-law..... you MUST boil the gravy for at LEAST a minute to get rid of the flour taste.  Then I added some gravy master for added color.  VERY very good on the fly gravy.  This will be my mainstay recipe for when I dont have drippings to make real gravy.  I prefer the broth over the bullion so I can control the salt.

Oh my gosh this is so good. I used better than bouillon beef base, about two spoonfuls. I reduced the amount of water to about 1 cup. It made a pretty thick delicious gravy. I will be using this from now on. My pattern of cooking this recipe was melting the butter and mixing in the beef base, mixing the flour and water separately and then slowly adding it into the mixture of butter and base.

I made this tonight because I thought I'd surprise my husband with meatloaf and didn't have any gravy mix.  It was really good!  I followed the review by kcfooddoc and made a roux, sauteing the onion (1/2 of one finely diced) first.  Then I used 2 cups of water with 4 bouillon cubes.  It was very salty, no doubt about that, but once mixed with the mashed potatoes, which were not salty, it was fine. I think that I need to keep some low-sodium bouillon cubes on hand for this.

So easy and so good. I left out the onion, and used beef broth that I had left over from cooking a pot roast that had onions in it. This will now be my new go-to gravy recipe.

I boiled the water and bouillon first, (2 c water, 2 soft beef bullion), I added the 1/4 stick butter and then 1/3 c all purpose flour, pepper to taste. This was the best gravy I ever made,  t is much better than the envelope gravy when your in a bind. Oh, I didn't use onions because my hubby hates them, still a phenomenal recipe! :)

What a delicious, simple gravy!  I usually just make gravy from a packet, but I forgot one when I was last at the store, so I thought I'd try this and it was great!  I made a roux from the butter and flour, then added in the boullion cubes and water (no onions as my husband cannot have them).  Using real butter made it taste so rich and delicious--mmmm. I'll be making this in place of the packet gravy from now on!

Wonderful recipe that is great as is, but can also be modified to suit your personal taste.  I used 3 teaspoons of onion soup mix in place of the bouillon since I didn't have any on hand, beef stock instead of water (I had some in the fridge I needed to use up before it went bad!) and then left out the onions and this couldn't have been a tastier gravy!  This accompanied my meatloaf and mashed potatoes perfectly.  My two picky eaters gobbled up their potatoes and said it was the best gravy ever!  I do agree with the other reviewers though that there is a specific process to making this gravy.  Definitely melt the butter first, then whisk in the flour until slightly browned, and lastly, add the water/bouillon/broth and keep whisking until thickened.

I can honestly say this was my first attempt at making "fake gravy" without using meet drippings.... honestly I can say this recipe is not half bad...... I heated the water dissolved the bouillon cubes added the onions and half the butter... then i stirred flour with a little water to dissolved and slowly added that to thicken... it seemed to work however the other reviewer seemed to make sence about sauteing the onion then adding the flour and then the water with the bouillon... either way it turn out good for me...

How refreshingly easy! I was in a pinch, needed something fast and uncomplicated so I kept my fingers crossed while following this to a tee. I literally threw all 5 ingredients into the pot, brought it to a boil & waited. Less than 15 minutes later, perfection! I used beef "Better Than Bouillon", 1/2 of a large Vidalia onion (diced not chopped) & unsalted Amish butter as these are what I had on hand and the flavor of this quick, no work gravy surpassed expectations. A keeper!

We made a beef roast that did not produce much juices, so I was happy to find this recipe.  Made it as written except I subbed dried onion for the chopped onion. Added the juices we did have from the roast then ran it all through a strainer.  The gravy was great in a pinch.  Thanks for such a helpful recipe.

Made this gravy to go on top of fries for the Poutine recipe from this site. I did not change any ingredients, but I did do things a little different. First, I sauteed the onions with butter. Then I added the flour and rest of the butter. After that was browned, I added in the bouillon and the water. It turned out very good! Thanks! I will make again.

Made this last night with chicken bouillon.  Not great gravy, by all means, but a nice recipe to have in a pinch.  It will always be better if there are some pan drippings to add.

This was my first time making gravy and this gravy is great and easy! I followed the advice of other reviewers and whisked, I also used 2 bouillons and 2 cups of water, it was a bit salty so next time I will use just one bouillon cube, Thanks for the great recipe!

Love it!  No more last minute stress about getting the gravy perfect before the potatoes and roast get cold!  Gravy can be made ahead and clean up finished so you have time to enjoy your guests when you are cooking up a big meal.  Only thing I altered was to cut back on the butter.  Made it too creamy tasting IMO.  Other than that it's perfect and the only gravy I will make from now on!

Great recipe for a last minute gravy without having any natural meat juices available.  It is thick, but I added a bit of water to thin the consistency.  I also used onion juice instead of the onion, for a smoother gravy.

Amazingly simple - great little quickly recipe!  I usually make a roux and do this in order, but you don't have to.  Just throw it all in and use a whisk until its thick and smooth.

Love this!  So easy and delicious- I'll never buy another packet of gravy again!  This recipe is perfect when you don't have pan drippings to work from.  I make it as-is and have tried suggestions from other reviewers such as using Kitchen Bouquet for browning.  Great either way.  I've also used my immersion blender to make it nice and smooth, as the first time I made it I ended up with some onion chunks.

Perfect for poutine! We loved this recipe. Browned the onions in butter added flour and made a roux. Mixed the bouillon and water together then added to the roux. Simmered for 10 minutes. MMM

Great gravy recipe. I have never been able to make one I've liked, until now. I halved this since I was just cooking for myself. I also used canned beef stock instead of the water and bullion. I didn't brown the onion first, I just put everything in together, and it turned out great and was super fast! I served it over rice.

This is a really good beef gravy recipe.  Like others, I cooked the flour with half of the butter to make a roux first. For a more homemade taste, skip the bouillion and use beef broth instead (Swanson makes a good one).  Use two cups of beef broth, adding it slowly while stirring to the roux.  Cook until it thickens, stirring to prevent burning.  Season to taste.  This makes a nice thick, flavorful gravy without all the fuss of straining pan drippings.

This was my first beef gravy and it came out awesome! I made it for meatloaf and buttery mashed potatoes, and everything went really well together.....I chopped up 2 decent slices of onion, and that was plenty to give the recipe good flavor. Next time I might try to use 2 teaspoons of boullion instead of 3......I can always add another one if it's not salty enough(I used the boullion cubes, and 3 seemed like it might be a little much)

Wonderful recipe...I substituted onion powder for the chopped onion, just about 1/2 tsp since its flavor is super concentrated and my bf won't eat onions (plus, the bouillon has plenty of seasonings already).  I made a roux first which I allowed to brown a bit for color.  Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

Good basic recipe.  I browned the onion in the butter before adding the flour to make a paste.  Then I added the stock slowly while I whisked it.  Came together nicely and a very authentic taste!

This was surprisingly good.  I sauteed the onion a bit in the butter, then added the flour to make a roux before combining and boiling it with the other two ingredients.  We had it with leftover meatloaf and potatoes -- it made a tasty meal.

I didn't read reviews prior to making this and my gravy got quite lumpy. I wisked it until it was no longer lumpy but would have preferred some more detailed directions. Next time I will take other's advice on making the roux first.

This gravy was fantastic.  I didn't really think it would turn out as good as it did by looking at the ingredients.  As it was, I added a pinch of garlic powder and some S & P for some extra flavor.  Thanks!!!

I used 1/2 package of onion soup mix, eliminated the chopped onion and added 2 tsp of beef bouillon granules.  It was delicious.  Some may want to add mushrooms also.

I've never made gravy from scratch before so I was delighted that it was an easy recipe to follow. I took the advice of others about cooking the ingredients in steps and it came out very well. 

Next time I will probably put less bullion in it because it was a little too salty for my tastes, although it was perfect for my salt loving boyfriend. I also added a quarter teaspoon minced garlic, and pepper for flavor, as well as 1/4 cup of milk to make it a little richer.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for as my husband is a gravy fanatic and I am not.  It was so easy to make, especially since the ingredients were all on hand. There was one modification that I thought was necessary; I combined the butter and flour first to make a roux, then added the liquid. This makes the smoothest gravy with not a lump in sight.  My husband loved it!

This was a good recipe, even my children liked it, whom do not care for oinons.I sauteed my oinons with the butter, then added the flour. I browned the mixture then I changed the beef bouillon to 25% less salt beef bouillon,and the water. This was not salty at all.

I loved this gravy! Way addictive. I had to make extra without onion and combine though. Onions come in all sizes, go small.

Tasty!  I used it in shepherd's pie.  A good simple beef gravy.  (I don't make gravy very often and I was afraid it would never smooth out from a big lump..  but it did :) just be patient!)  I used one boullion packet.

I loved this recipe! It was delicious, I scaled it down to 4 servings and used one beef boullion cube.  I also added some worcestershire sauce to make the color more dark and it added flavor.  Overall great flavor!  It thickened really great too.

This is an excellent, simple beef gravy recipe.  Follow the advice of other's and add ingredients as they have instructed (butter & onion, then flour, etc.) and it should turn out smooth.  It really has excellent flavor.  Thank you.

I had made beef tri tip (with chopped yellow onion and two beef bouillon cubes from knor) in the small crock pot I have so I used 1 1/4 cup of the juices.

I made the roux first with salted butter, added the beef tri tip juices and an additional 1/2 cup of water to get it thinner to my personal liking. Great base recipe to build off of.

I must say I was really impressed with the results and taste.  I looked at the reviews and followed the tips everybody else gave.  Make the roux first. Butter and flour once you get the color you want then add the onions.  Once the onions are done add the beef bullion cubes.  Add your water and keep stirring until it thickens.  Great simple recipe.

Really easy to make like the other comments say (roux first then add water and bouillon) and really tasty but  this does not need 3 tbsp of bouillon. I added 1.5 tbsp and it was saltier than Poseidon's butthole. I just thinned it out with a bit of extra water and then it was all good. I think 0.5-1 tbsp would be the perfect amount.

I used it to make beef stroganoff and it turned out great. I always use left over roast beef or steak with mushrooms and chip dip. This time I had no gravy base so I used the exact recipe. My family loved it.

Very quick and easy, but also VERY salty (because in part of the additional bullion I used AND I had no unsalted butter). 
No surprise, I wanted the gravy a bit darker so I used 4 bullion cubes, instead of 3. 
I prepared it this way simply because I did not have any gravy,  no stock, and no large cuts of meat in the house to make my own pan gravy. 

While whipping up Salisbury steak as a quick, last minute supper, I went to the old standard quickie gravy (here), and it served it's purpose. It did make a thick, flavorful beef gravy.

Typically if I go this route, I use unsalted or low-salt beef stock instead of bullion. 
I also pre-cook the finely diced onion until carmelized, for added flavor. 
Then, just before the onion is finished, I add a small amount (1/2 tsp.) of freshly minced garlic to the onion and cook for 2 minutes. I then whisk it all together, with a few grinds of black pepper, until thickened.

Just as the recipe states, Simple Beef gravy,  read the reviews and be sure to add your butter and flour first to make the rue and pour your bullion in last and stir while slowly pouring.

Turned out pretty good! I first made a roux with the butter and flour, and just used dry seasonings to flavour it. It looked more like a chicken gravy, but it tasted quite yummy!

It tastes a little better than the stuff out of the envelopes. You could add mushrooms, green peppers and use it for smothered burgers.

The gravy was amazing I added a lot more water because it was so thick but after doing so it was the best I used it for stuffing and baked chicken.

I loved this recipe, although I did have to substitute the beef bouillon for chicken because that is what I had on hand but it came out delicious. Even my husband whom does not like gravy loved how it came out.

Pretty good, certainly easy, and reliable, if you don't follow the instructions with the recipe. Do as others say - cook the onions in the butter until starting to brown, add the flour, stir well, letting the flour  cook a little, then add the liquid very gradually, whisking until all the liquid is incorporated.  Bring to a boil and cook until thickened.  I'll add less onion next time - it was a little too onion-y for me. We served it on meat loaf to 40 people today and the plates came back clean

Great recipe! Ive decided that this will be my no failure turkey gravy recipe also. Just add the turkey drippings instead of the beef bouillon. Substitute chicken bouillon for chicken dishes.

Turned out great. I threw the onions, flour and butter into the pan all at the same time, and cooked the roux until it was a golden brown. I used beef broth rather than bullion, but kept the wet/dry proportional. The only thing I did a bit differently was to use a couple (or three) tablespoons of consommé (Campbell’s) in the gravy for flavor. It already has seasonings in it, and is my secret ingredient when you don’t have all the other stuff you need to dump in beefy-flavored things. I used it on hot brown sandwiches.

I used organic better than bouillon beef base and onion powder instead of onion so my kids would eat it. Great taste and really just the easiest gravy I have made. I used it for moco loco and everyone loved it. Does not happen often in my house.

Horrible!    Extremely salty & I like salt!  I used 3 t "Better than Bouillon" beef base, maybe that was the problem.  Tried to add more flour and water but still toot salty. 

 Putting that aside, way too much onions, I think this would be better if it gave a measured quantity instead of 1 onion.  

 I usually read review before trying a new recipe,  I'll have to see how others reviewed this.  Sorry.

This is quick fix when you need a sauce....had a good flavor...but it did tighten up on me. I added a little milk and it gave a creaminess to it.....Thanks Happy Cooking!

I am usually helpless when it comes to making gravy.  This was a very simple recipe that came out with no lumps.  I also browned the flour in the melted butter and slowly added the liquid. I also added salt and pepper to taste.  I will most certainly make it again. I give it a 4+.

My family is not use to salt (in base) so I had to double the recipe... Added more flour and corn starch to a bowl with hot water before adding to already hot gravy mix.

Made it to the exact specifications and it was way too salty, thick and gelatin like. I even tried adding water and nothing helped. My boyfriend usually eats anything and he wouldn't even touch it. Do not recommend.

Wow,  didn't think something so simple could taste so good.  I was impressed.  I combined all ingredients (I used 3 teaspoons of onion granules in place of the onion)  except the flour....i brought them to almost a simmer on low heat and then whisked the flour in slowly,  instant thicken.  It was very tasty and thick.  Loved it

Easy, followed reviews advice on sauté onions, make roux, then add water.  Cut recipe in half for 1 adult and two kids.  Kids loved it over leftover steak and rice.  This is a keeper!

Easy and good! I followed instructions from the reviews on the order of how to make it, and added a little bit of milk at the end because it was thicker than I wanted, but I was really surprised at the taste. I was expecting to add some more flavoring, but this recipe does not need it!

Very tasty. Took me a few times to master though. I had bullion cubes so I used hot water and when I put the flour in little balls of dough in my gravy. Second time is the charm.

I sauteed the onions in olive oil for a few minutes, then added the butter, then the flour before adding the water and beef bouillion. I like have a roux made before the beef flavor is added. It worked out well and I will definitely be making this again!

Yes my husband and big sons love it that much.
I was in a big hurry so I used 1/2 t.  of onion salt
instead of fresh onion.
I also started by making a roue of the butter and flour so
that I was sure not to have any lumps.
I won't be buying brown gravy packets anymore.
This is too easy.

I was surprised at the good taste of this quick gravy.   I tripled the recipe but only needed the 1/4 c. flour to reach the thickness desired.  I would definitely use these recipe again.

I made this but used 1/4 cup prime rib drippings and 1 tbl of butter as the fat base. It was hella thick, so I ended up using about 2 cups of water. I also substituted thyme, garlic, onion, salt at 1/2 tsp each instead of bouillon.

Good gravy, just make sure you melt the butter and sautee the flour before adding other ingredients. Also I used cubed bullion instead of powder. I put 3 chicken cubes and 3 beef cubes and added 1/3 c. Milk to cut down on the saltiness. It was quite salty but after I added the milk it was perfect! Thank you :)

Oh, good gravy! (Wink.) So delicious for something so simple! I didn't have onions, so I threw in (for a double batch) just under a teaspoon of onion powder and a couple dashes of garlic powder.
YUM!

awesome gravy. my husband ate the whole thing. I made it just for him because no one in the household eats gravy and he loved it!!! Used the exact ingredients but cooked the onions and butter first then added the rest. will make again for Thanksgiving.

This recipe is simple and delicious :) But way too salty, I suggest to reduce the butter by 5 grams or just add more water until it's not that salty anymore. I do exactly as advised in the comment section to avoid lumps and the result is wonderful. And most importantly because this recipe is very easy to make, I'll be sure to use this recipe again in the future  :D

Delicious! And saved me a trip to the store just for gravy! Very easy to make.  I followed other reviewers advice and sauteed the onion in half the butter first then did butter and flour to make a roux whisking continually. First time I've made decent gravy from scratch!

This was great, I used a couple of different suggestions. I sautéed the onions in the butter, then added flour and cooked that for a bit, added beef bouillon(powder), added a small amount of Worcestershire sauce and water. Stirred with a whisk often.

Total newbie but trying to make some changes to my family's food from packaged to homemade. So I used organic flour and natural beef broth in place of the water. I added black pepper and did as others by sauteing the onions first, added flour then the beef broth. I did add a tsp of beef bouillon trying to darken the light gravy but it did not help. It tastes like roasted gravy but sort of looks like chicken gravy. For a first time try it was simple, delicious and all natural ingredients. I am so glad I tried this.

The onions cooked slowly due to cooking it in the wrong order making it stick to the bottom of the pan.  See the suggestions of others here.

Simple is good,people! My only tweak next time would include sauteeing the minced onion first in half the allotted butter than adding the remaining butter when adding in the other ingredients.

Love it! I used two beef bullion instead of three because I thought it would be to salty and added pepper. I didn't used the onion because I didn't have any in the house.

I had some leftover potroast & my gravy from the night before was awful.  I followed this recipe and added just a dash of worchestershire & gravy master along with a little salt & pepper.  That was it.  Threw it a sauce pan and kept stirring.  Once blended, I added slices of my leftover roast to heat it up while I mashed potatoes.  Perfect dinner & my granddaughter who does NOT like mashed  potatoes, had 2 helpings with the GRAVY on it!  This  is a keeper  for me.  Would work for chicken too!

Too simple, everyone liked the onion flavor in the gravy.
I made it in stages as others had mentioned, and added some beef broth at the end cause it was a little thick for our liking.
Nice flavor, really quick.......thanks for sharing.

great and quick in a pinch -- added sour cream at the end for a more stroganoff flavor to top bleu-cheese stuffed burgers.  
as other cooks recommended would saute the onions first and make the roux -- for my first time out of the gate I tossed everything in together and got lumps and undercooked onions.  I strained most out but would leave in if cooked through.

This gravy was EXCELLENT! I had never tried making gravy without roast drippings before but this was perfect. I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon and sauteed the onions as suggested.

Yes, this is simple and it's beef flavored, and the best part is that it uses common pantry staples. It's great to make in a pinch when you don't have any meat drippings or beef broth in the house. I used it to go over rice.

Super easy with ingredients almost every household has sitting in a pantry. Made nearly as printed. Did pay attention to the suggestion from reviewer "inguri" to saute onions in butter and then whisk in the flour for the roux. We also added some leftover mushrooms with the onions. The texture with the onions/mushrooms was a little different, but still delicious. Love that this is a gravy recipe that does not require meat drippings.

For a gravy recipe so easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand and this good was a surprise!!  I did add more beef base then what called for for a stronger flavor as well as seasoned it with salt and fresh ground pepper.  My husband also thought it wasn't bad.  This was my first time making gravy of any kind (even out of a packet!!) so all I can say is....SUCCESS!!

Eh, it was alright. I was excited to get a recipe for brown gravy cause I don't like turkey gravy and the store stuff is terrible for you, but this was disappointing. Next time I would halve the flour, double the bouillon, and add salt. I didn't put in onion, but I did onion powder, and I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.
I'll keep looking, thanks

Great easy way to make beef gravy. I didn't have any onions oh hand, so I used about one teaspoon of minced garlic. I also added some onion powder and Worcestershire. Family loved it!

Made this without the onions, but with onion powder.  Simple to prepare.  I used beef broth instead of water, as well.  Went well with mashed potatoes and cajun meatloaf.

This is hands down the best gravy I've ever had.  I used it to top leftover Eileen's Meatloaf (also on this site) and mashed potatoes - delicious!  I eyeballed the recipe as changing the servings skewed the numbers.  I chopped down half an onion and sauteed in butter, roughly 6T, until softened.  While that was cooking, I mixed 3 beef bullion cubes in 2 cups of hot water and set aside.  I browned about 2 1/2 T flour, stirring constantly, then poured in the bullion water.  Switched to a whisk immediately and swirled it the entire time the gravy thickened.  I wasn't satisfied with the color so I added a few drops of Gravymasters - oh yes.  Heaven.  We found ourselves getting more meatloaf just to get the gravy!

I was really impressed with this recipe; I did as recommended by other reviewers-sauteed the onions, whisked in the flour, etc.-then mixed in cooked hamburger and some frozen peas, straight from the freezer. Cooked it for another 5 minutes or so and voila! The peas were just the right touch, they balanced the onion and the bouillion and added just enough sweetness. I will definitely make this again!

1 onion seemed to be too much onion, so I scaled down to 1/2 an onion and the gravy had a strong taste of onion still (I did make sure I sauteed the onion first in the butter until soft/tender). I used a medium sized yellow onion.  If you really like the taste of onions in your gravy, then this recipe might be ok for you, it just wasn't to our liking.  Follow the other reviews on instructions to make the gravy (making roux first, then add your liquid and bouillon).

My changes: 2 c hot water, 2 beef bouillon cubes, 1/2 onion, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 1/2 tbs butter, and little less than 1/4 c flour. Put all ingredients into my Vitamix blender and blended on high for 4-5 mins till steam was coming from vents and gravy was heated through. Easy, tasty, and no saucepan to clean!

Great recipe! I used broth in a box instead of water, then added an envelope of unsalted beef bullion, and onion powder instead of fresh onions.... later added beef drippings from roast beef out of the oven. Yummy!

Not bad, good in a pinch. I used a can of poutine sauce instead of water and two bouillon cubes. Skipped the onion (didn't have any) and used browned flour. Added an array of seasoning. The best gravy is made from drippings though.

I made this tonight with beef patties. I let it simmer to thicken in the pan with the patties. It turned out great! I was afraid mine would turn out white like in the picture, but it turned out brown. I also used buillon cubes instead of granules, and less onions (not an onion lover). It was great!

This gets five stars in my book, just for how quick and easy it is.  I've made this twice now, once as written using the beef bouillon and once using chicken broth for a chicken version.  Both were good.  If you're in a pinch and need gravy, this is the way to go!

I'm a novice in the kitchen, but I wanted some gravy for my noodles and I tried this.  I was just cooking for one, so I reduced it to the 3 servings, but man was it salty when I tasted the result.  I suggest adding a little more water to dilute it or a bit less of the beef stuff.    For the record, I did what one of the other reviewers suggested: melt the butter, mix it with the flour and onion (I used 1 tablespoon of onion powder); mix the water and the beef stuff; then put it all together in a saucepan and let it cook.    Like I said, it was good, but salty.

This was excellent!  My husband is allergic to dairy so this was a great recipe to find!  We served this over baked breaded pork chops and it was so delicious!  Oh, and we used 2 bouillon cubes instead of 3 teaspoons.

Really easy and good! I made this vegetarian by using no-chicken boullion. I did as other people did- sauteed the onion, added the flour and sauteed for a bit to create a sort-of roux, then added the boullion & water (that I had already heated and mixed). Came out beautifully!

I used two boullion cubes to 1 1/2 c. water. it was too salty for my taste. But an easy recipe. Will alter for better taste next time.

I thought this was an easy and tasty recipe.  I thought it was too salty, so next time I will reduce the beef bouillon to two tsp. and hope that does the trick.  For you first time gravy makers:  I've learned that you need to put the thickening agent (flour, corn starch, etc.) in the water first to completely dissolve it and then add the rest of the ingredients and put the heat on.  This recipe says to do that but others I've tried didn't and I've made many lumpy gravies.  If you feel you need to add more flour, dissolve it in a bowl with a little water and then add it to the hot gravy mixture.  :)

This was great for a quick last minute gravy. I didn't want to freak the kids out with chunks of onions so I used onion powder, but otherwise, everyone enjoyed it. I was making a very quick last minute meal and this was perfect, I'll definetly be using this one again.

I'm super picky about my gravy.. I loved my mashed potatoes! So I was excited to try this, and it turned out perfect!! I used all the ingredients too. I fried the onions first with some of the butter, then added the water, bouillon cubes and butter, etc and THEN I whisked in the flour. It was PERFECT!! I'm in love.. never need to make another kind of gravy again.

This is our favorite beef gravy. I use a can of beef broth plus 1/4 cup of water because I think it's more flavorful. And I use a tablespoon of onion powder instead of chopped onions, because I'm a lazy cook. Instead of making a rue on the stovetop I melt the butter in the microwave, then add the flour, cover it with a lid and shake it. Then I add that to the gravy (again I'm a lazy cook). I also like to add a few shakes of worcestershire sauce and an envelope of gravy mix.

my husband raved about it, i took the advise and made it in order with the half butter and onion then the other half then the flour and then water and bullion, next time i may use less flour, it was a little thick for me, but my husband said it was fine. but i have always been a little funny about gravy, so thinner for me would be my taste, it was soooo delicious

Very good. I used this for 1/2 the recipe of "Roast Beef Stuffed Shells." I did add 1 tsp extra to get a more beefy taste.

How yummy!  I didn't use onions mostly because I prefer a smoother texture.  This recipe is so versatile in that you can use chicken bouillon too.  Be careful though because it can be on the salty side.

This was my first attempt at beef gravy, and I wasn't thrilled...But I don't believe it was the receipe's fault.  I was looking for simple, and this seemed to be easiest one I could find.  Maybe it was still to difficult, but it didn't have a very strong flavor.

Works like a charm, though "1 onion" is a bit vague.  Unless you like a strong onion flavor in your gravy, try using quite a small onion your first time.

This was good as is, but for my likings I added some fresh ground pepper, kosher salt and kitchen bouquet.....for the color, it gives it the rich golden brown color, without changing the flavor.  I used this gravy for homemade meatballs, so yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good. Full of flavor. I was expecting it to be salty, but I didn't think it was as salty as some canned brands I've used before. I tripled the recipe and I'm very glad we have left-overs. You will be impressed.

ive never tried to make gravy before, but this was awesome.  i used chicken boullion instead - didnt have beef.  i think i added too much because it was a little salty, and i didnt add onion, just some onion powder, but it was still great.  i was shocked.

This recipe was fantastic! I usually use packaged gravy but didn't have any on hand. I looked online for something i could make with ingedients I already had at home and of course I ended up coming to allrecipes.com.  I didn't have the beef cubes so I used chicken instead. it was phenomenal! Thank you so much!

This was so easy and quick. Great for when you need a last minute gravy and much cheaper and better tasting than store bought. I use the paste instead of the boullion in my house, so I used that in this recipe. Obviously its not the best gravy I've ever had but for its convenience factor I'm giving it 5 stars.

This is a good basic gravy recipe.  I added some thyme and I sauteed the onions with some mushrooms in a pan before adding them to the gravy.  Very good!  Thanks.

I end up always making this because it's so easy and always have the ingredients on hand.  When in a pinch, this is a great one to try.  Must like onions though!

This was good but I cooked it longer then it said because I wanted the onions to be tender.

I used a vegetable stock bouillon, added it and the water last, and it was simply wonderful! Next time I'll make a double batch so that I have leftovers.

This is a great simple gravy.  I also made the roux first and served it over mashed potatoes and meatloaf.  YUM!  Also great with chicken bouillon!

I loved it.  Hubby said it was a little too salty, but I thought it was a fast, simple addition that I will definitely be using again.

I use this all the time, it is high on sodium and calories but when you want some good old comfort food this does the trick.

We loved this gravy!  I think I added a little too much bouillon, because it was VERY thick, but otherwise, it was wonderful!

My husband wasn't too excited about the onions in the gravy.  I thought it was pretty standard gravy, but nothing amazing.

Thanks for the recipe!  I needed a "jar of gravy" for a slow roaster recipe I am using tomorrow, and since I didn't want to go back to the grocery store, I tried this out.  I followed what other reviewers did, but I added a clove of garlic to the onion (habit, what can I say?).  It is a little on the lighter side, but that's fine with me.  Yum!  Thanks again!

This made really good, easy gravy.  I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I added about 3/4 of a can of beef broth, and reduced the water.  Great recipe!

Excellent!  Very Rich!  I took the advice of browning the flour to darken the gravy.  That was an experience. Next time I'll open the windows first.  I will try this without browning the flour next time, I think it may have altered the flavor. My husband says it was perfect..don't change a thing! My gravy hating children even loved it! Thanks
