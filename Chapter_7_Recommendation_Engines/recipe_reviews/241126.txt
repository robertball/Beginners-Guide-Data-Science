A nice creamy dressing for a pasta salad.  I used a twist pasta and added cucumbers, green onions, red, yellow and green peppers, tomatoes and shredded carrots.  The dressing is better if made a day ahead.  I made the dressing and added it to the pasta mixture.  It was good, but the next day, after the flavors had time to marry, the salad was much better.  Thanks clarkie24, for sharing your recipe.

Wow. I was looking for a pasta salad dressing that wasn't a traditional Italian dressing to go with a grilled citrus chicken dish. I stumbled upon this and wow wow wow. Amazing. I am new to the mustard world so I dont know what spicy Dijon is. I did 1 tsp Dijon with Chardonnay and 1 tsp spicy brown. I also used miracle whip as the creamy base. I also made this one day ahead. It may not last until tomorrow!!

I made this dressing for a pasta salad for a baby shower I was hosting. Since I had a lot of food to make, I made the dressing 2 days before. I had to add more salt and pepper, but it was a good dressing overall. I would make it again. Thanks.

I used this dressing to top a cob salad. It was delicious. I did modified it....(trying to appease the family)....My hubby doesn't  like mayo, so I did 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup mayo. I also used a low carb sugar replacement instead of the sugar. Further modifications include dried herbs, not fresh. It was a great dressing, even with the dried herbs, I can't imagine how lovely it would be with fresh herbs. Nice change from ranch. Has almost a creamy greek taste to it.
