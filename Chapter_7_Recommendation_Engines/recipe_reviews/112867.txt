I have given 5 star ratings before, but I have to say that this leads them all! Fire roasted tomatoes was pure genious especially when combined with the feta cheese.  Because of the salt content in both the tomatoes and the feta cheese, I opted not to add any additional salt. It was not missed, in fact, it was perfect.  For a double recipe I used 3 cans of the tomatoes and a pound and a half of the larger (21-25 count) shrimp. Will I make this again? , oh yeah.

This dish was spectacular.  It tasted like I was eating at a very nice italian restaurant, but it was so simple to make.  This is something I will make again and again! Everybody should try this one. I made it with brushetta and it was a fabulous meal.

This was an excellent recipe!  A welcome change.  I did use a few more shrimp and cut them in half to better distribute them.  It made far more than two servings.  At least 3 if not 4 depending on the appetite.  I did have a hard time finding the fire roasted tomatoes, but I'm glad I did.  This would have been very bland without them.  Thanks!!!!

Tastes good. Don't add extra salt due to the shrimp, tomatoes, and feta. Feta is a very salty cheese. For those who can't find the fire roasted tomatoes, Safeway carries Hunt's brand, but I prefer Muir Glen Brand. They are organic, and have a wonderful roasted tomato flavor, deeper than the Hunt's brand. Also, they don't have that canned tomato taste as much as the Hunt's brand does. They can be found in your grocers organic foods section or at a health food stores. They are pricey, but well worth it. It's the only canned tomato I use.

I make a very similar recipe. It has been my go to shrimp pasta recipe for years. I saute a small onion in olive oil, then add the garlic cloves for one minute. Then I add the fire roasted tomatoes, 1/2 c. white wine, fresh chopped oregano and some red pepper flakes. I simmer this together for 15 minutes or so. After the pasta is done, I add the shrimp to the sauce and cover the pot. When they have turned pink, I crumble in 4 oz. feta and stir well. Pour it over the pasta, garnish with fresh parsley and serve. Key is not to overcook the shrimp. Cheese does not need to melt, just be distributed well in sauce.

wow! I am 13 and i made this for my parents (as i love  cooking and  pretty much cook everything) and they both said   it was the best meal I has ever made. i  made the  recipe yield 4 servings and  used 3 servings  of those little  baby frozen shrimp amnd the fun pink striped noodles i bought at a specialty store. next time i  will   use more shrimp or only cook the 3 servings my family needs! and  everyone should try  this! it  was like  a  restaraunt in italy and with  fresh toasted garlic bread it is even better!!

YUM! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  First off, this is SUPER EASY - and really good.  I, too had to hunt for the fire roasted tomatoes and they are worth it.  I also used a lot more shrimp, frozen raw.  Unless you can find the really huge (and expensive) big prawns you really need to use a pound.  I also used butter instead of olive oil to saute the garlic.  I also used more like a cup of feta and put it in the pasta when it was really hot so when I mixed everything up it gave it more of a creamy texture but the flavor of the feta came through.  Also used dried basil instead of fresh and that was fine too.  My husband said "this is like a restaurant meal" and it took me 15 minutes!

This is a great little whip up recipe.  I couldn't find the fire roasted tomatoes, but subsititued them with a chilli tomato concotion and everyone is still raving about it.  I also finely diced up some red (spanish) onion and half a carrot for a little more flavouring and a little chilli... Yum! =))

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The flavors complemented one another perfectly and the shrimp was an excellent addition to the pallet. We used 12 shrimp and cut them in half to ensure they lasted longer. I would probably recommend adding more shrimp (maybe 20?) & cutting them in half. The easy-peel shrimp were not costly & were very good. Another good addition to the recipe would be olives. This recipe received 5 stars because my husband just couldn't stop raving about it!

This was amazing! Of all the recipes I have tried on here so far, this is the one the family keeps asking for. I did use dried basil because I couldn't find any fresh basil in the store. When I told my husband it was fire roasted tomatoes, he thought it was going to be spicy but it's not at all. I love the way the flavors of the tomato and the feta intermingle. This is an all around great recipe. I highly recommend it! If you or someone you know doesn't care for shrimp, you might try substituting for chicken pieces. I did this for a friend and it still came out great.

Wow, this is SO good. The feta, fire-roasted tomatoes, shrimp and garlic complement each other perfectly. I maybe added a bit too much feta -- it has such a strong flavor that you don't need much to complement this dish. The only other thing I noticed is that there is quite a bit of juice in the canned tomatoes -- I will let my sauce simmer a little longer next time so that it's not watery when I pour it on the pasta. I will be making this again and again!

Super yummy dish!  I add sliced kalamata olives and crushed red pepper flakes to this instead of the black pepper. Be careful how much salt you add as feta is very salty and so are canned tomatoes. Serve with crusty bread and a spicy red wine and you will be in heaven! Impress your guests with this elegant but easy dish!

Wow...sums it up. So easy and quick too. I increased the recipe for four people, using 2lbs. of extra large shrimp and 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes. Also added a big wooden spoonful of pickled jalapeños. The feta cheese on top was a great addition...creamy and spicy. My husband said this one is a keeper. Thanks Amy.

This was really good. I loved how the feta melted into the tomato juice and made kind of a creamy sauce. It was great with garlic bread and broccoli. I'll be making this for my husband when he gets home in June.

An excellent weeknight meal -- tasty and easy! I like having sauce to dip my bread in so used two cans of fire roasted tomatoes (one regular, one with chilis). I let the tomatoes simmer on low for about 30 minutes. Then I sauted the shrimp in olive oil, 4 cloves minced garlic and heaping 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Once pink, I poured the contents of the shrimp saute into the tomato sauce and stirred in the feta. The suace was thick, creamy and carried a bit of a punch.

Had to give it only 3 stars because of all the tweaking it needed; as other reviewers said, it needed more spice. Used the red pepper flakes, oregano, and wine as suggested, but only after making as directed and found it lacked flavor, so I did give the original recipe a chance.

A quick, easy dinner with items I usually have on hand. I may have boiled a little too much pasta, because I was wanting more sauce. I may try again using some wine in the sauce as another reviewer suggested. My husband ended up adding some homemade ground pepper spice to his, because it didn't have quite enough kick. (We like spicy). I still think it was good! 

A tip for fresh basil - chop a whole bunch, measure by the Tb and fill a few cubes in an ice cube tray, then add water to the trays. Pop out the frozen 'basil cubes' and store in the freezer in a freezer Ziplock. Then you always have chopped, fresh basil. (Very easy to add to soups as well).

I used a pound of whole wheat pasta, pound of 26-30 count Prawns, 5 oz Lite Feta plus about 3/4 cup brocolli with like amount of mixed Shitake and Oyster mushrooms. Like "intelligentperuser's" review on this recipe I didn't add additional salt and I only added a second can of Fire Roasted Tomatoes, not 3 cans. I used more Garlic and Basil than called for as well...go figger!!! A nice recipe for any occasion.

I loved this quick and delicious recipe.  I added some fresh parsley and lemon zest and I could not find fire roasted tomatos so used diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano added.  I made recipe according to directions and def came out with 4 servings with 1 left over and added double if not triple the amt of shrimp and they were the large ones.  My kids loved it.  I served along side garlic cheese bread and ceasar salad.  Will def make again.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used 1lb shrimp, and a lot more basil.  I also added crushed red chiles.  I put the feta in the sauce before the pasta to let it melt down a bit.  The only thing I would change would be to cook a little less pasta.  I think 1/3 lb would do, but Im a gal that likes a lot of sauce :)

This is awesome.....delicious and fast.  I cooked for house guests and they made me print out recipe for them.  This is the first time I've used fire roasted tomatoes and what a difference!  I will never use another kind.

I am not big on tomatoes but this dish was very good. I didn't have as big of shrimp so I just dumped a half bag of medium alad shrimp in (we love shrimp). Definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

I followed the recipe to a T!!!!!  I liked it but felt like something was missing.  I might add green olives or maybe saute onions with the garlic.  Would make again with some small adjustments!

This was very good - light but flavorful and filling. I used more shrimp than called for (I didn't measure, just kept tossing in handfuls) and probably extra feta, too. ;) I couldn't find fire-roasted tomatoes so I just used italian-spiced diced ones... still delicious, and definitely a keeper!

WOW!  One of the best meals I've made in a while.  Easy too!  I chose a spicy tuscan tomato sauce as I could not find the fire roasted kind.

Was pretty good.  Might have made for a better side dish than the main course, though.

Fabulous recipe as-is!  Definitely restaurant quality.  It really is ready in less than 30 minutes and is incredibly easy to make.  I added a little (1/4 cup) white wine with my olive oil.  Next time I will also use one more can of tomatoes for more sauce.  I will be adding this to my make often recipes.

Made this last night and it was a delish - fast dish.  I made a pound of angel hair and used the Fire Roasted Tomatoes with Green Chile from Trader Joes. While sauteing the garlic - then shrimp - I added about a half cup of white wine then added the tomatoes and heated thru. I poured the mixture over the pasta in a large pasta bowl. Well the pasta just soaked up the sauce.... So next time I may up the wine to a cup or even reserve some pasta water to mix in. Other then that - really good dish!  Thanks for the idea of adding feta to pasta!!!

The best pasta ever!! If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would, my husband actually said that was the best pasta he has ever had, it was so full of flavor, I could not find fire roasted tomatoes, so I made my own, I cut the tomatoe in 1/4's, brushed them with a bit of olive oil and broiled them until they turned black, chopped them up and they were great.  I will not waste time searching for them in a can. I did add a bit more olive oil as I was afraid there wouldn't be enough sauce also added more basil and feta, it was soooo good. you must try it.

Great recipe.  SOOO quick and easy to make.  The taste is definately restaurant quality.  I added lots more shrimp and fresh basil as well as some capers. I also used tomato and basil feta, since that is what I had on hand. Thanks so much!!

The only thing I did different was to add some sliced mushrooms to the oil and garlic. Also I used coodked shrimp so I added them at the end with the tomatoes.
We would make this again.

This is the best recipe I have made from this site! It is amazing as is, but if you want more heat it would be good with crushed red peppers. The fire roasted tomatoes is a must-otherwise it would be too bland. It is easy and yet you can make it for company.

Made this last night.  All I can say is ... WOW!  This was soooo good, I felt like I was at an Italian restaurant!  My son took the leftovers to work, and all the men were just drooling over the smell and wanting a taste!  This is a keeper!  Thanks Amy for a great dish!

This is  a good basic recipe, that I took up  a notch by adding more spices >>red pepper flakes. more garlic cloves, a little  oregano and more basil -  also added 1/4 cup white wine, 1/4 cup cream and 2 T cream cheese -  it was  very good--- I would add more  feta next time ,  but  had some in refrigerator already and should of gotten more - I  used more shrimp  too  -I  will make again!

This is delicious. Not a budget recipe...the feta and shrimp make it more on the gourmet side...but worth it as an occasional splurge for our family. Our five picky kids all LOVE it and it is so simple to make! I followed the directions nearly exactly; I didn't have any fresh basil so I substituted dried.

This recipe was surprisingly delicious for such a simple recipe.  I agree with the other reviews, this dish turns out like restaurant quality.  My husband and I ate this for dinner one night and then each had a lunch-sized serving the next day.

Our grocery store didn't have regular fire-roasted tomatoes so I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes with green chiles that I already had.  Made for a very spciy version, I think I'd rather stick with regular tomatoes.

A little overly-tomato flavored for me, but a very tasty meal. Used some Schwans' 6-cheese tortelloni, and a pound of 16-20 per pound shrimp along with the fire-roasted tomatoes.

Pretty good recipe...I tried it a second time and doubled the recipe. I used one can of regular fire-roasted tomatoes and one can of tex-mex style fire-roasted tomatoes. I also sauteed some onions before adding the shrimp and used garlic powder rather than cloves. Lastly, I added some parmesan cheese to the sauce and pasta.

This dish is quite tasty,however i did make a slight addition. While the mixture was heating i added 1/8 cup of heavy cream,which helps to keep the pasta from soaking up the mixture and drying out while adding a touch of sweetness,then added some cayenne pepper to taste for a little kick. Turned out very well.

3 stars for the recipe as-is - it's pretty bland.  I added some sliced black olives, which helped, and next time I will add some white wine to the sauce.  A sprinkle of red pepper flakes would be a welcome addition, too.

I have not cooked this yet but it seems to be very good. I have a question: I will not be able to get fire roasted tomatoes. What can I use instead or how can I prepare them myself? Thanks in advance for your suggestions.

I wasn't too sure about adding the feta, even though I like it.  I went against my better judgement and am so glad I did!  I allowed the entree to cool before adding the feta and it was fabulous!

I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but I'll settle on 3. I thought it was only alright. I added some spinach, which I thought was a nice touch, but I think next time I'd replace the shrimp with chicken.

so-so   le hace falta sabor. Los roasted tomatoes tienden a ser dulces, y no tienen acidez.Luego de cocinar los camarones  espese la salsa antes de reunir la pasta y los camarones. Substituir aceite por mantequilla,y posiblemente adobar los camarones antes de cocinarlos.

I have made something similiar to this for years but the change of the fire roasted tomatoes and the feta are wonderful. If your stores offer it, definitely use the fresh feta packed in water - milder and far less salty than the wrapped variety. I'm a frozen fish snob and never use frozen seafood but got to yapping to the man behind the fish counter about cleaning shrimp... I dubiously bought a recommended raw, cleaned frozen shrimp package he recommended and it was wonderful. This will be a meal I can whip up anytime I feel like it with out running to the store!! Thanks you!!

Pretty good recipe.  Neither me nor my husband were blown away by it, but if you like feta cheese, then you will like this dish.  My only complaint is that it seemed a bit dry...could have used more tomatoes or tomato sauce.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  I added a little bit more garlic (as I always do), pretty much doubled the feta and used 1 lb of medium shrimp.  I couldn't find the fire roasted tomatoes so I used Garlic, Basil and Parsley Tomatoes.  Came out amazing!

Fast, easy, and delicious. Loved it! My store was out of fresh basil, so I had to use dried. I am sure it would be even better with fresh. Good enough for company. This one is a keeper.

I would also give this 5 stars! It was delicious. The only thing I did different was use a can of salsa ready roasted tomatoes and it was spicy which we enjoy, but I know it would be good with the other tomatoes too! Will definitely make this again!

This was very good!  I added onions to the garlic, added kalamata olives to the tomato, used much more feta (added to the hot pasta and as topping) and tried my hand at flash frying the leftover basil!  Dear Husband and I agreed adding artichoke hearts would be good, and clams instead of shrimp would work too.

Not over the top, but good. I had to sauté onion first, just to use them up. Then added more garlic and red pepper flakes, fresh basil and oregano. Added the tomato with a bit of Marsala and let it simmer because I needed a bit more sauce for personal preference. I only had Penne pasta in the pantry so used that. Both the BF and I were happy, especially after a late evening of work. Will do again because we always have most of the ingredients on hand.

This is a restaurant quality dish and so easy!  I used more shrimp and cut them in half to distribute them better.  I found the fire roasted tomatoes at Aldi.

Good but it needs more spice, and it's a bit too salty even without added salt. I might add some vegetables (zucchini, bell pepper, or something) to cut the salt.  It definitely makes more than 2 servings as I prepared it. 

When making it, this time, I changed it to up the spices but it still needed more:  I partially cooked 1/2 lb shrimp in 2 cloves garlic (for flavor) but added them to the sauce at the end to finish cooking. I did add more spice to the tomatoes -- 1/4 minced onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 large jalapeño, and 1-1/2 tsp dried basil -- and cooked them a bit to meld the flavors. I'm limiting pasta intake, so I served it over brown rice (which was delicious).  I'd increase the onions and basil (or add oregano) and use red pepper flakes instead of jalapeño. I might try a bit less feta to cut down on the salt.

This was easy and delicous! I will say that it makes mere than 2 servings, in my opinion. I doubled the recipe and had at least 8 servings. Very tasty, though.... my family loved it too!

This is a Greek dish called shrimp saganaki .   I use canned or fresh tomatoes  rather than the fire roasted one.
Other recipes from Greek cookbooks use bell peppers as well .   no basil either and Greeks use rice rather than pasta

Fire-roasted tomatoes, linguini, shrimp, feta and basil..A very good combination of flavors and textures...I also chopped and sauteed 1/2 of a medium-size onion.  I like the crunch and flavor...also went a little heavier with the feta.  Try it!

Easy and delicious!  Used about 20 shrimp and added about 1 tbsp capers and 1/4 cup sliced kalamata olives.  I always have canned fire-roasted tomatoes in the cupboard and will absolutely make this again.  Thanks!

An easy, quick meal to prepare.  I made no changes, but plan to add more garlic next time. Husband was a big fan and said "it's a keeper"!

This was so fast and easy, and really delicious.  Didn't change a thing, and this will be a regular "go to" recipe for dinner in a hurry.

This was very good with some very minor changes.  

1) In the future I will use jumbo shrimp.   The recipe calls for medium shrimp.  The grocery store only had jumbo shrimp...so the pound was only about 18 shrimp, but by the time they were shelled and cooked they shrunk up.  I would prefer the larger shrimp over the small shrimp.

2) My first step after cleaning and shelling was to put the shrimp in a zip-lock bag, pour in a couple of tablespoons of canola oil and mixed in about 6 cloves of fresh garlic and salt.  I marinated the shrimp in this for about 2 hours and it made all the difference giving the shrimp an incredible flavor.

3) Recipe calls for 3 cloves garlic.  It definitely needs more than that.  I minced about 6 or 7 LARGE cloves of garlic.

4) I use fire-roasted diced tomatoes *with garlic* to add more flavor.

5) The editors suggested 3 tbl of fresh basil instead of the one tablespoon in the recipe.   I think even more could have been used.

6) For an additional 'kick' I added a few shakes of crushed red pepper and about 1/4 tsp of Ancho chili pepper powder. 

7) I served one portion with feta sprinkled at the end. It was MUCH better mixing it into the pasta before serving to let it melt a bit.

Instead of wasting the time and  water to "bring  a large quantity of water to boil" I put the pasta in a large skillet and cover with water.  When the water is just boiled away the pasta is done. 
To keep the shrimp from being overcooked and rubbery,   I do not cook them ahead, I add them with the tomatoes. In the time it takes for the tomatoes to get heated through, or only slightly longer, the shrimp is perfectly done, not rubbery.

Really tasty and quick, love that. I used 3/4 lb of shrimp and no added salt. Used  dried basil this time, but looking forward to fresh basil from my garden soon. Yummy!

I made this recipe, and was surprised that it needed something  more, flavor wise. I had my shrimp marinating  in lemon pepper and blackened seasoning, so it wasn't the shrimp. The pasta and sauce needs salt for sure. I put extra garlic in, after I tasted it, and it was too bland. I added some fresh lemon juice, which helped brighten up the flavor. The fresh basil was great too, but by the time I was tasting the sauce, and trying to bring out more flavor, it seemed a tad too late. I didn't want to add a bunch of random spices and wreck it. I think I would have enjoyed a cream based sauce with butter,  and maybe even onions, more. So I give it 3 stars because it needed way more flavor for me.

I found this recipe in my allrecipe magazine, and the instructions there call for a pound of medium shrimp, not the twelve in this online version, so ours was really full of shrimp! Yummy, my husband ate half of the four serving recipe, easy to tell that he liked it! Next time I will add more garlic and basil...It was a really quick and easy recipe, except that I purchased raw shrimp, and had to peel and devein them, well worth the effort in my opinion, the shrimp were fantastic!

The recipe was really easy to follow. The shrimp can easily be substituted for chicken. I added more basil to make it come out more in the dish.

Very delicious. I've made it at least half dozen times and it just keeps getting better each time! I do sprinkle my shrimp with some spicy Cajun seasoning because we prefer some hot spice on shrimp, ( but that's all I changed.) This recipe caught my eye on the April/May magazine and I made it as soon as I had fresh basil to go on top.  It is just perfect for a summer meal on the patio with salad, garlic bread  and a glass of wine. Thanks!

This dish was excellent. I used large red shrimp which made it more special. I will make it again. 
This can be a company dish and is very easy to make. I gave it 5 stars...

Great recipe!  I doubled it for myself, my husband and my son, adding the shrimp to the tomato mixture last so as to not overcook the shrimp, then adding the pasta and mixing it all together.   I sauteed sweet onions in olive oil, added extra fresh basil and next time will add more garlic.  I didn't have feta but I had fresh mozzarella and herb and garlic goat cheese, both worked out very nicely.  Definitely will make this again.

Excellent and sooo easy! I also couldn't find fire roasted tomatoes so I used a can of roasted garlic diced tomatoes and added a sprinkle ofred pepper flakes and a couple dashes of hot sauce. Terrific! Thanks for sharing this!

Great fresh tasting recipe!  I made this last night for my husband and he gave it rave reviews.  Just the two of us and have plenty extra for another meal.  I used cooked shrimp for convenience and increased the fresh basil as suggested in Allrecipies magazine where I found this treasure.  Yum!

I made this tonight for the first time. Couldn't have been easier & was delicious. I made a few additions to the recipe just for my own tastes. I sautéed shallot in the olive oil before adding the garlic (love sweetness of shallot & garlic together) and then I did add a few red pepper flakes to kick up the heat a notch. I also used whole wheat linguine. It was so yummy. The feta adds such a nice tang & creaminess to the dish. I can't wait to make this again. Love!!!

I read nearly all 148 reviews. After All Recipes' Test Kitchen added nothing other than more basil, I figured the recipe could not be better improved and followed the recipe. I did add some reserved pasta water to increase the sauce and that worked. I thought the sauce lacked richness. It is not a "first date" or "company" dish because of the awkwardness in eating the linguini -- biting off or slurping hangover linguini (even twirling with a spoon for amateurs) face down in your plate, and the feta and shrimp must be eaten separately, of course. My family prefers a Parmesan taste in pastas to a feta taste. After adding the linguini to the tomato "sauce," the plated dish is very attractive but had to be microwaved to make it hot luke warm. I wasn't fond of the texture of the tomato skins on the fire roasted tomatoes. For the picture and recipe to be featured on the cover of All Recipes magazine and a two-page recipe spread I was disappointed in the results.  I consider myself a fairly skilled home cook so I try to take into consideration those with differing pallets and cooking levels.

This tasted great, and was so quick, hubby couldn't believe it when I told him dinner was ready after just 30 minutes. I used gluten free pasta and I think it sucked up a lot of the sauce, so I add about a 1/2 cup of white wine and it came out perfect.

This recipe was desperation based. Couldn't figure out what to do with a bag of frozen shrimp until I found this recipe. Quick and didn't take anything unusual. Didn't have fresh basil but dried worked just fine. Added some fresh parsley for garnish.  Looking forward to making it again!

Good God, this is amazing! Here are 3 modifications that really kicked it up:  1) Add about 3 heaping tablespoons of sliced green olives 2) Sprinkle a little red pepper flakes to taste (a little heat really adds dimension). 3) Increase the number of shrimp. I used 18 which was perfect. Mine were actually pre-cooked and still delicious. Next time I'll try the fresh ones. I used whole wheat spaghetti and the Muir Glen brand of tomatoes. Wow... this was killer. Can't wait to make it again! Thank you Amy!

made exactly as directions say, the only thing was it seemed like it was missing something.  I think next time I make I will ad some hot sauce to kick it up or add more garlic and fresh basil.  was still good though.

This was an awesome recipe!  My husband said he wouldn't mind having this once or twice a month and that is a rare thing for him to say.  I didn't change anything except I added mushrooms because we are mushroom lovers and used whole wheat linguine.  I used Hunts Fire Roasted tomatoes.  The Feta really gave it that extra flavor.  Great Recipe!

This dish was super easy & tasty!  We aren't big fans of shrimp so I substituted boneless chicken breast and I added olives for a little extra flavor.  Everyone loved it!  I will make this again.

This was so good however, I did almost a different receipe.   I use chapoli shrimp (which had sauce to it) added fresh spinach and sun dried tomatoes instead.  The feta cheese was a great add. Fresh basil would have been awesome, however I used dried.  No measuring took place and it was great.

I have made something similar for a few years but the change to using Roasted Tomatoes and adding in the Feta makes a HUGE difference.  I also add a generous amount of red pepper flakes while I'm sauteing the shrimp.  A great easy quick dinner!

The first thing out of my husband's mouth after his first bite was, "THIS IS GOOD!!!" The only change I made was to add red pepper flakes. I used frozen cooked shrimp because it was what I had on hand. I just thawed them and added them after the tomatoes had heated through. Will definately add to my favorites file!

good - a tad dry & bland so I added some lobster stock, crushed red pepper, onion & sundried tomatoes instead of fire roasted since that is what I had on hand. I also threw in some broccoli. The feta melted beautifully - and I even used fat free. Quite nice.

Yummm! As always I tend to alter the seasonings,..I tend to cook with a little more garlic so I added a couple more cloves than called for..otherwise came out great. I will be making again with some adjustments to the garlic and maybe add some onion as the last person mentioned! ;) Thanks!

I read many reviews before making his and saw that alot of people felt this needed a little extra something to it.  I made the sauce as was, tasted it, and agreed it needed just a little kick.  I added a little extra garlic powder, several good shakes of red pepper flakes, and then doubled my fresh basil. I used double the shrimp too. I melted the feta into the sauce, to help thicken it, but felt like I lost maybe some of the feta taste this way. Next time I will try, as written, to just toss it in at the end. Overall, hubby gave a great rating, will go into the rotation. Thanks!  UPDATE **** I made this again, but with an over abundance of tomatoes from the garden I diced up 14.5 oz of fresh tomatoes instead, and then added some extra onion and garlic powder to the sauce.  I melted the cheese in the sauce again to make it thicker. Hubby still gave good reviews.

This recipe is very simple and quite good. It literally only takes 15 minutes to make and not only tastes delicious, but looks very pretty on the plate. The fire-roasted tomatoes are an absolute must, however. I would not substitute any other kind.

The feta makes this dish.  I felt in the pan the sauce was rather bland, so I added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes for kick and extra garlic.  Will make again with these additions.

Very good. Next time I want to add more shrimp, I used 15 and I think it would be better with more and maybe some sliced mushrooms or green/red peppers. So easy and tasty!

When I saw this recipe I knew I would love it, all my favorites, shrimp, feta, pasta, but I have to tell you I was a bit disappointed.  It was just missing something.  Perhaps if my shrimp had been fresh sweet gulf shrimp that would have helped, don’t get me wrong it was good just nothing special.

This was not really that great. The portions are way off - I cooked for "2 servings" and it fed 4 people plus a little extra. And I needed to add more shrimp. Over all was just kind of blah tasting. Don't think the fire roasted tomatoes go with the Feta either.

I had high hopes for this simple recipe.  It was good, and very quick to make.  But, it's missing something.  Maybe red pepper flakes.  Anyone have ideas?

this was very good.  nice light meal.  loved the fresh basil and the fire roasted tomatoes with the creamy feta cheese.  the rest of the family wasn't too crazy about it; so i guess it won't go into the rotation too often, but i liked it and that's all that mattered cause i'm the MOM!  LOL

This sounded like it would be tastyas it was, even so, I couldn't help but give it a tweek or two. For the pasta, I used 1/2 spinach & 1/2 regular fettuccine. I added sliced Kalamata olives and marinated artichokes to the sauce. I think that there is a lot of room to play with this wonderful base recipe.

I used this receipe as an idea and made some changes - used sun dried tomatoes instead of fire roasted & added some asparagus I had in the fridge.  I blanched the asparagus & thru in w/the garlic/olive oil/shrimp.  I also added red pepper flakes in w/the garlic.  The addition of the Feta was AWESOME.  It wouldn't have been as good w/o the cheese, that is an absolute.  Even my 11 year old liked it.  Easy and different.

So fast, so easy.  I put a couple basil leaves on top as a garnish and it looked magazine-ready!  My husband's only complaint was that I broke the linguine in half and it made it hard to swirl on the fork.

YUMMY! I doubled the recipe and did as others suggested by adding the feta cheese to the sauce at the end to thicken it up.  I also added chopped Kalamata olives to give it an extra mediterranean flair to it. Restaurant quality recipe.

I think the recipe was great.  I Couldn't remember weather the recipe called for fire roasted or sundried tomatoes so I got both.  I changed the recipe completely but this is what I did.  It was such an easy recipe to make adjustments to.  I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes to saute the asparagus and red onion and garlic.  At the end of cooking I added the basil (dried I couldn't find fresh though it would have been better) and artichoke hearts.  As another user said I added the feta while it was hot and just before serving I added fresh spinach but will let it wilt a little longer next time.  Loved the recipe thanks for such an easy one.

I've made this several times - fire-roasted tomatos come in a few varieties, and I like the kind that comes with green chilis for this recipe.  Adds a little kick!

This recipe was very tasty and could not be any easier. I followed it exactly except I used whole wheat pasta to make it a little more healthy (even though I didn't skimp on the feta!)

My husband liked this more than I did.  I thought the fire roasted tomatoes gave an interesting flavour but I would not make again.  My husband was crazy for it, which surprised me.  Just ok, IMHO.   I gave the extra star for my hubby's licked clean plate.

Tastes excellent, definitely worth a repeat. Next time we're using more shrimp, though. In this recipe, the taste of shrimp is overpowered by the tomatoe.

A hit with my kids age 3 and 5, and my husband!  Easy to make gluten free, by changing the pasta!
