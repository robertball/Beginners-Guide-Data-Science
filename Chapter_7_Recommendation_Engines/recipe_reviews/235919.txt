These were delicious.. made per recipe.  A few things.. this makes a very thick dense dough.. and makes more than 12 muffins.  I made 12 muffins and out the rest on the bottom on a loaf pan. That was fine with me.. topped this with mozzarella cheese after it came out of the oven and had veggie cheesy pizza flavored bread for dinner

I significantly reduced the amount of baking powder and soda and they are yucky.

DONT COOK THIS there is definitely something wrong with this recipe with the amount of baking soda it calls for. I just cooked it with the exAct measurements and it tastes awful the baking powder and baking soda makes it taste disgusting.  This recipe should be fixed or deleted.

The flavor is awful, which is probably due to the insane amount of baking soda.
