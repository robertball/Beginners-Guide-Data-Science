The 1st time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly as written and I thought the batter was to "bready"  and it was lacking in flavor sooo the 2nd time around I did 2 eggs and added some tonies... came out great!! love the panko bread crumbs in tis as well!

THE BEST fried shrimp ever!  I've eaten lots of fried shrimp in restaurants - and nothing has been better than this!  I followed others advice and reduced the salt and omitted the pepper and replaced them with a teaspoon of Old Bay.  I also used only two eggs - which was plenty.  AND I dipped the shrimp into the egg twice -- once before dredging in flour and then again after dredging in flour (before coating with panko).  I also found that one cup of panko was plenty.  Another tip -- put them in the freezer for about 10 - 15 minutes after coating and before frying… I do this with everything we fry (makes the batter adhere better).   I fried them in 2" of oil in our deep fryer.

We really like fried shrimp & this recipe is the best I've come across.  I used about 1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning in 1/2 c. flour and about the same amount in 1 c. panko crumbs. Used only 2 beaten eggs.  Just the right amt of ingred for a 14oz pkg frozen jumbo shrimp.  Deep fried in batches of 6 for about 3 min @ 350 degrees.  Dipped in Cross & Blackwell seafood sauce......yummmmm.  The 2 of us ate everyone of them!! Good recipe.

This is "merely" a simple, basic method for breading and deep-frying shrimp.  But that doesn't diminish the fact that it is flawless in its instructions, resulting in perfect, delicious and beautiful deep fried shrimp you'll really be proud to serve and in seventh heaven to eat.

Ok, I gave this recipe a 3/5 ONLY because I had to yield the recipe down to 2 servings which kind've confused me with the ingredient adjustments PLUS I only had Gia Russa bread crumbs instead of the recommended Kikkoman Panko.  I also didn't have the freshest of cooking oils for deep frying usage and so on.  The end result was tasty but seemed alil more on the 'eggy-heavier' side instead of on the 'light-crunchy' side that I was aiming for.  A recipe I am willing to try again with the proper preparation needed but one I would prefer not to go through the hassle of doing if repeated with what I was working with.

Excellent recipe! I used two eggs, and instead of salt & pepper, used a bit of Old Bay. It's a rarity when all the kids like the same thing, but this one worked for everyone! Thanks!

Excellent!  Used homemade breadcrumbs.  Gave a good dose of Old Bay and some cayenne pepper when they came out of the oil.  We don't fry much so there were a great treat!

This is the best recipes EVER thank fellow foodies for the great tips! I also added blackened Old Bays  a lot 2 tablespoons was very tasty and not spicy or salty. Also used peanut oil it gets the hottest without burning turns the shrimp dark brown looks pretty. I will have a hard time ordering fried shrimp at a restaurant now!

OMG If you like Walts Famous Shrmp at Red Lobster you will love this recipe!!!  I used my deep fryer, changed the oil and set it for 350.  One minute and 6 seconds makes the perfect fried shrimp! My cocktail sauce is simple.......ketchup and horseradish to taste!  Perfect!

Used jumbo shrimp and they were delicious! I did add about 2 tsp. of Chef Paul Prudhomme's seafood seasoning, which IMO makes everything better. *only needed 2 eggs.

I made this with small salad shrimp...it was not good. You need to use the bigger shrimp otherwise you have alot of crumb & can't find the shrimp.

take my advice and get top quality shrimp...this recipe deserves the best.  Panko bread crumbs are a necessity, don't try with regular ones.  This was the best shrimp recipe I've ever made, and I will gladly make it again and again.

I thought this recipe was pretty good but a little bland.  My wife thought it was really good.  1:05 to 1:10 and they come out good and yes, eat the tails too!  Also, the advice about putting them in the freer for 10 minutes was great.  I now do that with anything I deep fry so the batter stays on.

Made these shrimp last night and man were they good!  No need to go out for fried shrimp any more!!  Only needed two eggs and added a little Old Bay to the flour and panko as suggested by another reviewer.  Shrimp came out light and crunchy.  Also, butterlied the shrimp for easier cooking.  Have saved this recipe and will definately be cooking these again.

Very good recipe.  Yes, use panko as this is a base panko recipe. One could always add some spice to kick it up to personal taste preference.  Interesting to note, those who down graded the recipe didn't follow the recipe.  What is that all about?  Somewhat irritating but then those reviews are of no  value or help anyway.

These were great! Thank you! I used 1 TSP of salt instead of 1.5 because my hubby has high blood pressure. I don't fry food too often because of the fat, not so good for you, and these took FOREVER to prep and fry, so I probably won't make again for a while--but they were the best tasting shrimp I have made in a long time.

It's a good recipe but does no one else question the call for 68 cups of Panko for 3 servings?

I needed an accompaniment to our lest Lenten Friday meal and these were perfect. Very easy to prepare and everyone loved them. The crunch of the Panko breadcrumbs definitely made this a winner and I will be making these much more often.

Very good, but I'll take suggestions from other reviewers and add some Old Bay and Cayenne next time to give it some kick.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. It was the first thing I actually cooked in my new apartment! The only note I have, and it's just a reminder and not against the recipe, is to be sure that you don't add too much of a coating or it will clump up in the fryer and not cook through

This recipe is very good! The shrimp is lightly battered and crunchy, and my picky children loved it. I also use this batter to coat swai fish before I grill it. Thanks for sharing.

I'm so happy that I came across this recipe this evening.  These were perfect, came out so good.  I followed the recipe, used a thermometer to make sure that my oil was 350, I put the shrimp in for 1 minute, and they were cooked to perfection.  That batter and breading worked really well together, everything adhered to the shrimp well.  I did let the battered shrimp just sit up for a while before I fried them.  I will definitely be making this again.

Regular bread crumbs instead of Panko but loved the crunch.  Breading stayed on the shrimp which was a big plus. Let the flour get sticky, then egg wash. Didn’t bread until the flour and egg mixed. Let the breading dry a little before frying. A+ for basic fried shrimp.

I was really surprised how great these came out! Due to my daughter’s gluten allergy  I used GF flour and GF bread crumbs which are more like panko.  Per another review I added seasoning to the flour. Again surprised how great these turned out!

The breading is great, would maybe use a little less pepper though. But when I would take a bite the shrimp inside was softer than I would have liked. While I probably could have left the shrimp in the fryer longer I feared I would have burned the breading. My husband enjoyed it so I give it a 4 because he is hard to please.

This is a great recipe. The basic concept is perfect and easy to modify to personal likes. 
I used 1/2" teaspoon of MORTON'S SEASON-ALL and 1/2" teaspoon of Paul Prudhomme's - SEAFOOD MAGIC instead of salt and pepper. This made the flavor allot better.  
I also made my own bread crumbs using French bread. Just lightly toasted 1/4" sliced bread at 350DegF. Turned once and cooled then crushed for crumbs. Better than panko.

This was perfect!   I followed a couple of the suggestions and used two eggs (that was plenty) and added a little Old Bay in the mixture.  These cook up very quickly and were delicious!   Homemade cocktail sauce of horseradish, mayo and ketchup along with homemade potato chips--great and easy dinner.

I did add Old Spice and a little garlic powder.  Let that soak for a little more than an hour.   Then followed the recipe—excellent.  This is actually the second time  i used this recipe—my wife and my step-son as well as myself love the crispy ness.

This was REALLY good!  A couple of notes:  I used giagantic shrimp, and at 350 the breading browned really fast!  I was afraid the shrimp might still be raw, but they turned out okay.  If you are frying anything thicker than a big shrimp, lower the temp to 325.  Also, start with one egg--it was plenty for 1 lb of big big shrimp, with some left over.  They were WONDERFUL!!

No changes.  Loved it.  I also made a lobster tail for the first time. I didn't change a thing.  My daughter loved it as well.  I will use these recipes again.

Followed recipe exactly and they were perfect. Could have eaten all of them myself! Super crunchy. The panko is the reason. Thanks!

This is a pretty good recipe.  One change I made was to save a step (and some mess) by combining the egg and flour into a light batter - then coated the shrimp in a mixing bowl. Then I transferred them to another bowl and coated them with panko.  I then dumped them into the fryer basket (over the sink), gently shook out the remaining panko, and put the basket into the deep fryer.  No need to get the hands messy with flour, egg or panko!  One egg was enough for 3/4th of a pound of shrimp.

These were the VERY BEST shrimp I have ever tasted.  I didn't make any changes except to add some garlic powder.  The panko bread crumbs made a world of difference.  As much as I loved them, I don't think I will make them again as, to me, it's a ton of work, but VERY WELL WORTH IT!

Excellent fried shrimp.  I bought a pound of 25/29 fresh shrimp from Joe Patti's here in Pensacola.  These were fabulous with homemade tarter and store bought cocktail sauce.  This is the only way I'll make them from now on.

jMARLE,it may be your shrimp. if you are using farm grone shrimp they have a very little taste to them. I use Texas gulf shrimp and they are so much better. Very likely that is your problem. The husband – – – Larry

The first time I made this, I made it as is. Fresh oil and all. The only thing was I didn't have Kikkoman Panko Bread Crumbs. It turned out overly breaded and lacking flavor. I told myself to give it another try and I did. For the second time, used fresh oil once again and I made sure to shake off access flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. I still had no kikkoman Panko. The end result was that the shrimp were not as overly breaded, but they still no flavor. So dissapointed. I wonder...do the Kikkoman really make or break the recipe? My final time will be with the EXACT bread crumbs. I'll update review.

My hubby, kids and myself all loved this recipe. Wonderful texture! I had extra large eggs and many reviewers said they only used two so that was all I used. I had lots left over.  I don't think we have Old Bay in Western Canada so I am going to put that on my list of things to look for when I go on my next trip to the US. I've seen it mentioned in so many recipes on allrecipes.com it seems to be very popular! So I seasoned with sea salt and pepper as the recipe specified. The only thing I didn't do as specified is use 2 inches of oil. I probably had about a half an inch of oil in the pot. I tested the temp with a thermometer and it was just over 200 degrees when I put the first shrimp in.  I know that the hotter the oil the less opportunity for it to be absorbed by the food but I was worried about smoking and splattering so I was a bit of a chicken to get it much hotter (based on how high I usually set my stove temp). I put the finished shrimp on paper towels to drain and ground a little bit more sea salt on top.
