Very good. I didn't add almonds on top because I didn't have any, instead I added some parmesan cheese. Yum!

I thought this recipe was great. It was simple and delicious. It's a good recipe for trying pesto the first time. Yum.

This recipe was very easy. I marinated the chicken with italian dressing and olive oil in the morning, so the chicken got a nice flavor, then in the evening I grilled on my square pan. I also made my own pesto with a recipe from this site called "Easy Pesto". I will definitely make this again.

A great base for a wonderful meal!!  I was looking for a recipe similar to a dish I had at a restaurant, and this was pretty close!  I sauteed garlic in olive oil, cooked chicken in oil, removed cooked chicken, then added about 3 c. broccoli florets, 6 oz. sliced mushrooms, and 1 pint cherry tomatoes to the oil.  Cooked these for 5 - 7 minutes, and combined with chicken, pesto & cooked pasta (I used whole wheat pasta).  I'll be making this often!!

We loved this.  I made the Simple Garlic & Basil Pesto from AR for this.  The chicken I just sauteed with a little butter and garlic.  It was absolutely to die for.

This is a great light and simple meal that is really perfect for summer/spring. We loved the flavors of the dish. For the chicken I marinated breasts in Italian dressing then pan seared in olive oil then threw them in the oven to finish off. The flavors went perfect with the pesto. Next time I will grill the chicken but it started pouring outside when I went to start the grill. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was good.  However, I did alter it a bit.  I added another clove of garlic and some olives.  Then I stirred the pesto (Costco brand) into the pan, heating it thoroughly.  Next I lightly tossed in the pasta.  Quickly plate it, pour leftover Pesto mixture over the top.  To finish it off I topped the recipe with a generous portion of parmesan cheese and toasted pinenuts.  Everyone loved it!  Will make again.

I found this recipe to be bland.  My kids hated it.  It needs salt.  My dish turned out mushy.  Pasta stayed in tact but dish was oily.  My advice is to season the chicken well, use less pesto, and try penne instead.

This was good but I will be adding some parmesan as a topping next time around. I will also salt and pepper my chicken before cooking as well, as the chicken pieces were a little bland.

This was very good.  However I used less pesto than it calls for for a light tasty dish.

We liked this. It was quick, pretty simple, used common ingredients and was tasty. I think the toasted almonds added some good texture to keep the pesto from becoming overpowering. Good weekday meal.

To be honest with you, never had pesto before.  I didn't know if I wanted to go through the trouble of making my own or store bought.  We bought Botini's Pesto and used that.  We had left over chicken from last night from another recipe from this website.  It was great!  I will be taking the leftovers to work with me.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this one.  So fast and easy!  I loved the crunch from the almonds.  Ours weren't toasted but it didn't matter to us.

I used toasted pine nuts rather than almonds and left out the extra garlic (used flavored olive oil). There was plenty of garlic in my olive oil and pesto.  Served this topped with grated parmesan.  This is quick and easy (and very good), I will be using this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really really good!  My son who is very picky also loved it.  He calls it "Hulk" green spaghetti!  I did add a smidgen of garlic salt to it, and a sprinkle of fresh parm on top.  Very yummy!

Very good! I added some cherry tomatos, crushed chillies, parm cheese, and pine nuts instead of almonds. The cold leftovers where great the day after!!

A very good meal, and pretty quick to make. I skipped the almonds but added parm. cheese (added a lot of flavor to the dish). I will make in the future, but maybe look for a reduced fat pesto to make it less fatting.

This was very good.  I was skeptical that my kids would eat the pesto, but they loved it!  I've made it several times now.

Made 1/2 recipe.  Cooked grilled chicken with garlic powder.  Used about 1/4 cup Buttoni reduced fat pesto with another spoonful - it was just about the right amount and lowered the fat of the dish.  Otherwise, made it according to the directions.  It was very good and very easy.

I had some frozen gluten free chicken breast strips.  Sauteed them according to directions, then added the oil (used avocado oil) and garlic and then the pesto.  I had gluten free pasta for me and regular pasta for my husband so divided the mixture between the two pots after draining the pasta.  Did not add the almonds because my husband doesn't like them.  Very easy and good recipe!

My fiancee is possibly the worst cook ever, At least I can count on my mom to cook me a great meal.  It was probably not your reciepe, it was probably my furture wife's horrible cooking skills.
