I researched other recipes because I like this base and the flavors added guarantees an amazing turn out, and super easy!  I added the following ingredients: 3 red potatoes diced, 1 celery stalk sliced, 6 oz tomato paste, 2 cloves garlic, 2 bay leaves, paprika, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauces, 1 cup organic beef stock, 4 slices bacon and a crock pot.  You'll want to warm your crock pot before putting the stew in it.  Take 1/3 cup flour (omit the 3 tablespoons vegetable oil) and place in gallon bag with meat, shake to coat and set aside.  Cut bacon up and fry in pan with mix of butter and oil (1 tablespoon each).  Remove bacon, save bacon fat in pan.  Add meat and brown, add onions and saute with meat.  Move meat, bacon and onions to crock pot.  Deglaze hot pan with 1 can Guinness, 1 cup beef stock, and 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce, add to crock pot.  Add all other ingredients and cook on low for 8-10 hours.  Check the liquid level, I had to add a total of 2 more cups beef stock while it was stewing.  The kicker, serve over Champ (mashed potatoes and green onions), and Irish soda bread (with raisins) to soak up the stew left in the bowl, there's no other way to get the full flavor!  Enjoy!

This is a good stew base - the consistency of the gravy was perfect - but it lacked flavor.  I would recommend adding your preferred blend of spices, as well as a little sugar to balance it out.

This stew was the best! I only added half the beer it called for and added beef broth for the rest of the liquid. I filled the soup bowls with mashed potatoes and poured the stew on top. This will be the only way I make Stew from now on! Thank you so much:)

Awesome!! Made it for an irish-themed dinner and everyone loved it. Served it over Irish Champ and soda bread (both recipies from this site). Excellent! I don't like beer but it just gave it a nice flavor. Will use more beer next time, actually. Definitely a keeper!

I make a similar stew to this. i use this entire recipe but Instead of throwing all the meat in at once, brown it in small batches and DON'T add flour until last few minutes of final batch.   Then remove meat and brown about 1 cup of very finely chopped onions, carrots, and clove of garlic over medium heat about 5-7 minutes stirring often.  Use some guiness to loosen up the brown bits in the pan and add meat back to the stew and continue.  The meat will brown way better in small batches (patience) and give more flavor instead of steaming in it's juices when you crown the pan.  The idea is: little bit of meat = drier heat & inside doesn't overcook + outside crusty.  The roasted veggies add a deep flavor that I love in most stews. I think it's a key step. Vary the amount to your liking.

This stew is delicious! Everyone (inlcuding me) raved about how wonderful the flavors were. I had to use dried thyme and a little extra beef, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. 
I served it in bowls on top of mashed potatoes, with "Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread" (recipe on this site) to go with it. Incredible!

hey this recipe was great.  even if you're not big on dark beer.  I added about 2 bottles of guiness plus a can of vegitable stock.  then added more root vegitbles, turnips in our case.  try with boston brown bread for dinner. this is now a permanent addition to my fall/winter menu.

I loved this recipe. I wanted to make my husband something fabulous for St. Paddy's day so I made this. It was so rich and tasty. We didn't have Guinness, but had some Michelob AmberBock on hand and it worked so well! Also added fresh basil from the garden. Wonderful! I will definately make it again!

Great Recipe!  Made it with beef broth since I could not get out to get a beer and it still came out great.  Added some celery and bay leaves but otherwise I left the recipe alone.  Served over champ,Delish.  Even my hubby that normally does not like stews liked this one.

WOW!!  I have rated and reviewed about 50 recipes on this site and this was the very first recipe that I have had an extremely negative review. I didn't care for this recipe. Couldn't doctor it up in any way to make it better. This recipe was just a complete waste of my money.

For more flavor, I add another clove or two of garlic, and I use a whole small can of tomato paste. This has become a tradition in my damily to make every st. patty's day. I buy sourdough bread bowls from panera and serve it in those, it is something I look forward to making every year.

My husband and I both loved this stew! I modified it by adding cubed potatoes to the stew, rather than serving it over mashed potatoes. Since I was worried the potatoes would soak up too much of the liquid, I added a touch more beer. It was delicious! The base is almost like a gravy, and is perfect to dip crusty bread into. I will definitely be making this again soon!

I made this over the weekend for an Irish themed party and it was a hit! (Already sent the recipe to a guest.) However, I'm giving it 4 stars because like many of the other reviewers, it didn't have as much flavor as I expected. I only made a few modifications:  for a doubled batch, I added one bay leaf, 1 cup of beef broth (for the slow cooker), and 6 oz. of tomato paste; I also used extra stout Guinness. Also, since it was 92 degrees out when I made it, after deglazing the pan, I put it in the slower cooker for 8 1/2 hours on low - great tip from the other reviews, thanks! Other than those changes, I followed the recipe. It was very good and the gravy was thick enough that we ate it alone -without potatoes.  Overall, really good recipe! The beer flavor is extremely intense the first night but mellows by day two (when I served it). This is a very nice alternative to traditional beef stew. The beer flavor can be a bit much for some people, but it's "...Irish Stout Stew," that flavor should be expected! In the end, this is a great recipe as is but it's also super easy to modify to your individual tastes. I'm definitely making this again!!

Really, really good. After deglazing the pan, I transferred it to a crockpot & added basil. Cooked on low for around 6 hours. Served over mashed potatoes. We loved it as is, the flavor was wonderful. Didn't find it bitter like other reviewers did. Thanks for the recipe.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because is a great concept.  Now, I didn't realize I HATED Guiness beer as much as I do!  LOL..as other reviewers had done, I tried to take out the bitterness of it by adding brown sugar..then I added worcheshire..some beef broth..more tomato paste, cooked it longer.  This helped some, but this stew is not to MY likiing.  If you like Guiness beer, make this dish!  If not, don't waste your money.  I may try again one day using a different beer.  But again, I am not giving it a bad review, this is just MY personal preference.  And don't forget, some say it was too bland, this is where step 3 comes in, taste and adjust seasoning. :)

My husband was obsessed with Guinness beef stew in Dublin, so I was excited to try out this recipe when we got home.  It came close to the "real thing," but seemed to be lacking something...I'm just not sure what?!  I recommend letting the stew cook without a lid for the last hour before you serve it so it has a chance to thicken up a bit.

This stew recipe was very good - easy to assemble and it tasted great the first time I made it!  The broth was thick - I was worried that it wouldn't be.  I also added in some mushrooms and potatoes instead of serving it with potatoes.

I wanted to love this recipe, but in the end it tastes like all the other beef stew recipes.  It's good, just not amazing.  It is a good excuse however to keep Guinness in the fridge.  And in my glass.

This is a good recipe and the gravy is very rich and flavorful. I simmered the stew the last 45 minutes with the lid off to reduce the gravy and intensify the flavor. Adding cubed potato and turnip might add a little something extra to the meal.

Very tasty! I just dumped everything into the crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours. Served over mashed potatoes as others suggested. I added a tsp of hot sauce at the end, which added a tiny kick. Perfect. Loved this recipe!

Made this for dinner last night and it was great!  I had some minor changes (didn't brown the meat, so I didn't use the oil or flour), used 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper, and a heavy dash of cayenne.  Also used about 3 TB tomato paste, 1 cup Guinness, and 1 cup beef stock, and dried thyme.  I wasn't sure about the smell while cooking in the crockpot (it wasn't bad, but wasn't good either), but I served it on mashed potatoes with Irish soda bread (also from this site), and it was a HUGE hit!  Because I used more liquid, I had a lot of gravy which I thickened with cornstarch.  DELICIOUS!

Really liked the stew. I did change a few things. I mixed the tomato paste with beef broth rather than water. I used an extra clove of garlic. I added some celery at the same time as the onion and garlic. Used a few more oz of beer. Added 2 potatoes with the carrots. being i put in some potatoes it needed a bit more moisture so I added some beef broth. served it in a sourdough bread bowl, my picky 8yo son said the best stew ever.

This was very good and I will make it again but next time I will cut down on the beer to about 1/2 and use beef stock for the remaining liquid. I thought the Guinness was a little strong. Also will add some Worhestershire. Now my boyfriend loves Guinness so he adored the dish, over mashed potatos was a winner with him.

The first time I made this was for St. Patrick's Day a year ago. We loved it! I have made it countless times since then. The reason I gave it 4 starts is... The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and it just seemed to be missing something. (although still very good) I have played around with the recipe a bit, and tailored it to our tastes.  In addition to the original recipe I add... 3 to 4 Bay Leaves and about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce. Guinness Extra Stout is the beer of choice for us, 1 bottle, and I will add a little extra tomato paste if it needs to be thickened up.  All in all, this is a top notch stew!!!

This was absolutely fantastic!!! I do not care for beer but this dish changed my mind. I used Guiness and the meat was so tender. I made this exactly as written except for adding 2 tbsp brown sugar and some worcestershire sauce. I was going to add potatoes like I usually do with stews but reading reviews I decided to serve instead the Irish Champ also found on this site. I am so glad I did. Why save this delicious dish for St. Patricks's day.......make it today.

my fave beef stew recipe to date - I have the pre-cut meat (just put it in a freezer bag with flout and montreal meat seasoning and shook it up, browned it in some canola oil and marsala wine and onion, added that to the crockpot, then used a bottle of guiness and beef broth and worcestershire sauce in the pan, poured that in the pot with 2 cloves garlic, mushrooms, a rutabaga (lg round turnip), carrots, yukon gold potatoes, celery, 3 bay leaves, paprika filled until my crockpot is to the brim - will serve with Irish champ  -yum! Thanks Want2hike!

My variation is to leave out the tomato paste, add some mushrooms, grate some stilton cheese into the mix and let it melt. Then, fill ramekins about 7/8 full, cover with puff pastry tops and bake till the tops are golden brown. The result is to die for!

This was SO good! I made it on st. pattys day, and served it over goat cheese colcannon (I sauteed cabbage, onions and bacon, and mixed it together with goat cheese mashed potatoes). I used parsnips and carrots, and added chopped leeks near the end. I will definately make this again!

Fantastic recipe!  We made it for an Irish-themed party and it was gobbled up.  The taste is rich from the beer and it's more like a soup if you let it simmer with the lid on the entire time (we took the lid off for the last 30 minutes which helped thicken it a little).  I would also recommend making it the night before for an even richer flavor.  If you like spicy you can put a few drops of Tabasco in your bowl (don't put it in the stew; the longer you have it the spicier it will get so Tabasco to taste when it's fresh means inedibly hot in a day or two).  Definitely needs more salt that the pinch the recipe calls for so I'd say use salt to taste instead.

This is an excellent recipe!! I've made it a couple of times and my family LOVES it.
In stead of simmering it on the stove for a couple of hours I dump it into the crockpot and set it to low. Then I don't have to do anything until we're ready to eat!!

This was really, really good.  Of course, I did my own thing with the basic concept.  I had 1 lb of stew beef, coated it with flour and browned it in bacon grease after cooking 4 slices of bacon to add to stew.  Browned the onions as directed. After reading many reviews and other recipes using stout, I reduced the renderings using the stout (full can of Murphy's) beef broth, tomato paste and some apricot jam, because many recipes I read added prunes, but I didn't have any.... (sorry, i did not measure any of these, just eyeballed.) I put the meat, onions, broth mixture, carrots, some chopped celery, white potatoes and sweet potatoes in a crock pot. I did not have fresh time so I added fresh rosemary. I added some garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Let it cook on low all day when I was at work, at least 9 hours.   When I got home, I cooked some noodles and added them to the crock pot to soak up the extra broth.  wow.  very tastey.

Pretty good recipe! I used Guinness Draft b/c it's what I had on hand and added a little bit of brown sugar and chopped up prunes (something I read in a different Guinness Stew recipe) and the soup was not bitter at all. It was slightly sweet, but I did also use "sweet" onions. I really liked it. I also added a bag of peas and about 16 oz. of beef brother because I like my stew to be more like soup. I will definitely be making this again! Goes really well with a quick beer bread.

This was great. Loved all of the leftovers we had because it seemed to get better and better! This does need some modifications, but it is very easy to suit to your tastes! I used a whole can of guiness as the recipe calls for. I found the bitterness went away the longer it simmered (about 3 1/2 hours for me). I added a T of sugar, a can of beef broth because I like my stews soupy, a bay leaf, and a shot of worsteshire. For the last hour, I added diced red potatoes. Loved the result!

Not that great of an irish stew.  My husband is irish and he reckons it wasn't that great.  It was very bland- and I added potatoes because you can't have irish stew withour potatoes.

Very good!  I added some bacon (just browned with the beef) & a tablespoon of brown sugar to balance the bitterness of the Guinness. Also topped up the liquid with some beef stock, 1 & 1/2 cups just isn't enough. Delicious served with mashed potatoes!!!

This was about as good as beef stew can get.  It's very rustic but tasty.  The only ingredient change was that I used one bottle of Guinness (I think this is less than what is called for).  After everything was mixed on the stove top, I put it into a crockpot on low.  I served it over mashed potatoes in a bowl so it had a bit of a sheperd's pie taste.

This stew is superb!!  Wonderful flavor when made with Guiness Stout, I did add 2 tbsp brown sugar as others suggested to offset the bitter taste of the beer, and it was awesome!

If you're looking for an alternative to boring stew, then this is definitely the one for you.  I used Killians instead of guiness, but mainly because I didn't want 5 left over guiness bottles that no one would drink.  Turned out beautifully!

Great with Murphy's stout- a little more mild and sweet. Waaaaaay better when you don't skip the step with the meat in the flour. Tried it both ways.

It was so bitter, not even edible. Used the guiness beer extra stout.

We just ate this for St. Patrick's Day. It was fine but nothing special. If you are just looking for a stew our family prefers the spicy curry beef stew from this site.

I tried this out tonight for St. Patrick's Day and I'm very happy that I did! A little while back I tried a similar recipe on this site called "Beer Braised Irish Stew and Colcannon" from MNIKOLAISEN. My stew didn't come out very good that time, but I also made a few errors. This stew though was perfect in every single way! Comparing the recipes, I think dredging the meat in flour before browning is the way to go. This made my beer broth thicken up enough that I didn't have to worry about it evaporating (which happened with the other recipe). I used a good dark malt beer which was delicious. I noticed a lot of negative reviews focused on this being too bland. Yes, it will be bland if you don't do anything to it! It says right in step 3 to taste and adjust seasoning before serving. Everyone likes their stew different ways, therefore I do not count this as something negative. I added two large cloves of garlic, a few tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, one bay leaf, one vegetable bouillon cube, salt and pepper. Mmmmm! Yum! Use your common sense when seasoning and this stew will be heavenly. I also really liked the addition of the tomato paste which the other recipe omitted. I think it gave the sauce a wonderful rich color. Overall, I was quite pleased with the outcome. I simmered my stew for about 1 hour and 20 minutes and it thickened beautifully and the meat was very tender. I served it over Colcannon and I had a great St. Patrick's Day dinner! Thanks for the recipe!

We ate this but it was really bland.  I followed the direction with just a couple additions thinking that would up the flavor.  I added a little allspice to the flour mix and went heavy on both the black and cayenne peppers.  I increased the thyme and added a few dashes of worchestershire.  Good enough to eat but I will look for a different recipe next time.

Excellent recipe.  We made it just as written, with two exceptions.  We waited and added the carrots for the last hour.  We also put cubed potatoes in the stew for the last 40 minutes rather than serving over mashed.  We and our guests loved this stew and it was a great alternative to corned beef and cabbage.

I made the recipe pretty much to the letter, though I did add some beef stock as I was worried the stout flavour might over power everything.  I didn't have any fresh thyme so I added a combination or dried oregano, dried parsley and a touch of cinnamon.  My partner thought it was the best stew he'd ever had!

It's so nice to find a stew recipe that doesn't have potatoes in it.  This is good served by itself with bacon-green beans on the side and a simple lettuce and tomato salad.

Excellent stew, I make this for St. Patrick's day. To top this dish off, I bring a drizzle bottle of very good balsamic vinegar to the table. Each diner can drizzle as little or as much as they want to taste.

This was a fabulous stew. I used more flour than called for, but I also used more meat. I blended the flour mixture into a large plastic bag so I could toss and coat the beef cubes easier. I was a bit concerned that the onion should be chopped fine, but that was not necessary at all. I did not have tomato paste, so I simply added ketchup -no water added of course. I did not chop the carrots, either. I like to simply add the baby peeled carrots as they are. I also added fresh green beans after a couple of hours because I like them in any stew. The other thing I added which was from another recipe on this site, was some whiskey in addition to a full bottle of Guinness. Some commented that the stew lacked flavor. The written recipe clearly states to adjust spices to your liking. I felt that it needed more spice, so I simply added more of the listed spices until it met my liking. I also added dried parsley instead of garnishing with fresh. I started my stew early and I noticed that the longer it cooked, the better it got. At 3 hours it was good. At 4-5 hours it was incredible! Thanks for the recipe. The changes that I made were only to cut back on prep time and accomodate what I had on hand. I can't say for sure whether or not the whiskey changed this stew much, but I will definitely be adding it again just in case. I served this over mashed potatoes...YUMMY..............We all loved it!!!

This was excellent.  I made it for a St. Patrick's Day Alaska Run.  It's was a huge hit.  Cooking the meat in smaller batches is the key.  I used extra thyme, cayenne pepper, and garlic.  For the beer I used Guiness Extra Stout which gave it a much hardier flavour.  After all was in the pot I transferred it to a slow cooker and cooked on high for 4 hours.  I made the Irish Soda bread with cranberries vs raisens to compliment the stew.

OMG!! This has become one of our favorite meals. This will be my 2nd time making it since St. Paddy's day. I too add beef broth right before I serve it over mashed potatoes, and I don't add the carrots. My very picky 9 year old said: "Mom, I really like this, when can we have it again?" He will be very happy to know that it will be tonight after he gets home from school.  I have also suggested to my mother to serve this on one of her Senior meals (where she and my dad cook for 120 seniors in their small town and several other communities surrounding it, once a month).

very good and very rich.  I had to work on St. pats day so the night before I browned the beef in bacon fat , i also used sliced celery, 6 oz can tomato paste,1c beef broth, and 2 c of Guniness (the rest of instruction I followed). I placed everything into the crockpot. In A.M. turned crockpot onto low. I served it over mashed pot/ with grren onions.

I made this for my family for St. Patricks Day dinner and boy was I glad I did!!  I loved the ease of this recipe by cooking everything in one pan.  I did not bother measuring out the tomatoe paste...just use the whole 6 oz can nor did I measure the beer, just use the whole bottle 11.2 oz  Like others suggested I added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar to cut the bitterness.  It seemed too thick so I added about 2 c beef broth also then simmered for almost 3 hrs.  Came out perfect, very yummy.  Definately recommend to serve this with the amazingly easy Irish soda bread from this site.  Thanks for a great meal!!

Fantastic.  I made this for my family and then had 7 extra people show up for dinner.  I was scraping the pot to get every last speck for everybody.  One man even asked me for the recipe.  I did add red potatoes, celery, concentrated beef stock, bay leaf, Worcestershire sauce and extra cayenne pepper.

My husband and I had an excellent stew at a Belgian restaurant at the Gold Coast.  We then set out to find a recipe that tasted as good - AND THIS IS IT!!! We added some brown sugar and worcestershire sauce and it was perfect! We also made it with Diane's Colcannon as per other recommendations :-)

This tasted so good!! It will always be my stew recipe from now on. I made 'Dianes Colcannon' potatoes off this site,, (mashed potatoes with cabbage and bacon, onions etc) and put a scoop of potatoes down on a plate and poured a scoop of stew over that. My in'laws were over to eat, and everyone loved it!!

So I read through a lot of the reviews and made some changes while i was cooking

I reversed the order of cooking the onion and beef...I remembered from cooking curry that if I wanted the sweetness of onion to really come out I had to cook it at low temperature for a long period of time until it's very very brown. However doing this will melt your onion. 

So I applied that here...cooked onion first then beef
Stuff I added
2 cups of beef broth
bay leaves
basil
brown sugar
6 Potatoes cubed (all different sizes)
sliced mushrooms

I did use 1 bottle of guiness
I found that my stew turned out great
I did not have the problem other people had b/c it was too soup like
I think it's b/c of the potatoes I added that soaked up some of the water and I did cook it with the lid off for about an half an hour letting a lot of the water evaporate out of the pot
I also might have used more flour then what was needed because I wasn't measuring and just poured flour until all my beef was covered.

Bf had the stew over rice and I had mine with pita chips that I made using greek pitas :) very yummy even though I burned the bottom of the pot a bit >_

This was a terrific stew!  I used a very inexpensive cut of stew meat, after 3 hours of simmering it was tender and delicious.  I did use quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavors.  I also added corn starch, a teaspoon and a half, mixed with a bit of water at the end to thicken the gravy.  Served in a bowl with mashed potaoes and stew on the side, gravy on top.  A garnish of fresh parsley completed the dish.  Well done recipe, thanks for sharing!

I started this stovetop in the morning and then transfered it to a crockpot so it would be warm for dinner.  I added about 1/2 lb of lamb and a little extra garlic.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  The gravy was a rich brown and glossy-telltale sign of a good gravy!  My guests (no strangers to good food) LOVED it as well as my 4 yr old.  Will make it more often than on St. Patty's Day!  We had it with Amazingly Easy Soda Bread (good if you like cakey bread) and Bread Pudding & Whiskey Sauce for dessert.  Fantastic meal!

This tasted okay, but not great. Definitely needed more spices and was a bit too thin. I added some cornstarch and water at the end to try and thicken things up. Served over Diane's Colchannon from this site.

I thought this recipe sounded interesting, and based on the past reviews decided to give it a try.
After following the directions to a T, out of the 4 of us who ate this, no one liked it.

I also thought the Guinness taste was a little too much - I ended up adding a can of fat-free low sodium beef broth to dilute it a little. I left out the carrots because I didn't have any, and used mushrooms instead (threw them in with some boiling onions during the final 30 mins of cooking time). We enjoyed this but, personally, I prefer my stew recipe that uses red wine instead of stout. Thanks, anyway!

It was delicious all I did different was put one beef bouillon cube.   As others suggested it was bland , it still could have used more spice even after the bouillon . But overall good taste would make again . Made with mashed potatoes great st pattys meal

It was a little "dark" for my personal taste. But the guiness lovers devoured a double batch of this stew. I added extra veggies and potatoes I had. Near the end I did need a little broth to keep from getting dry. I might have had the stove on a little high. Will make for many st patricks day celebrations to come!

I had a leftover cornbeef brisket that I used instead of the stew meat and since I didn't have tomato paste I added about a tablespoon of ketchup. The cornbeef added an amazing flavor! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is an AMAZING recipe and PERFECT for St. Patricks Day as its an extremely hearty stew (to compete with all that green beer you should be drinking!).  I recommend doubling the amount of stout you put into this, though, as it gives it such wonderful flavor and an almost creamy texture to the sauce.  I used Guiness Extra Dark Stout and it was GREAT!  Also, consider serving this with Colcannon (what I served it with) and your meal will be OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Be prepared to have people asking you for the recipes!

I'm sure this is a great recipe, but I just had issues with it. I know I don't like Guinness, but I thought it would work enough so that I would like this stew. If I had some on hand, I would have added a can of beef broth and that might have helped. Also, since I was watching my month-old daughter, I accidentally burned the stew 2 different times, so that might have affected the flavor itself even though I got all the burned bits out. I may try this again, but not sure as my husband doesn't like stew.

Also, I added about a pound of red potatoes 'cause I love potatoes in my stew. I only wish this had turned out for me.

This was excellent!  Really easy to make.  I had a hard time finding Guiness Beer, so had to go with another brand of "stout" but it was still excellent!  Not one to normally follow recipies to the tee, but I did this time and was not disappointed.  Lots of flavor.  The mashed potatoes were a unique touch and my family gobbled it all up... Thanks!

Did this stew for St. Patrick's day, my husband loved it! It was quite easy to do, just have to keep on stirring to avoid getting sticky on the bottom of the pan. Great success for 1st attempt. I didn't find Guiness, so used a German dark ale instead. Very good with my rosemary mashed potatoes

I made this last week for St. Patrick's Day, and it was quite tasty!  I didn't use the recipe (forgot to print it and my laptop had died) so I went from memory, using 2 14(ish) ounce cans of Guinness (which I happen to love) minus a few sips for myself LOL.  I also added potatoes to the stew instead of mashing them, because I was being lazy.  Because of all the potatoes, carrots and onions (along with the beef) it got very thick quickly, so I added a can of beef broth and misc seasonings (from a jar of mixed spices) and the taste was great...and my house smelled delicious!  I served it with homemade biscuits and my one problem was that it had a bit of a 'bite' in the back of your throat, much like drinking an actual guinness.  I don't know if this was because I didn't cook it long enough, added too much beer or what have you.  I've also heard that the cans with the cartridges in them will do that, but that's the only way I could find Guinness.  I'll make it again and play, because the flavor without that bite was delicious!

This was good overall- just a little bland. I added some sugar (about a tablespoon or two) as another reviewer suggested. I also added quite a bit of Maggi seasoning sauce. THAT made it really yum. If you can't find Maggi at the grocery, you can get it on amazon. It's great for savory meat dishes like this! I used a whole can of tomato paste. Also, I served it over egg noodles- which was also really good.

Everyone at the party loved it. I doubled the meat and spices, increased tomato paste to whole 6oz can, added 1 Tb Worcestershire sauce, 2 bay leaves, 1 can beef broth, 2 TB of brown sugar and used whole can of stout beer. I also made it the day before. I had to share the recipe others since they enjoyed it so much!

This came out very bitter.  Next time I would only use a small amount of the guiness beer and use beef broth for the rest of the liquid.

I found this too greasy, and did not like the flavor of the tomato paste at all. I usually use the same ingredients, but leave out the tomatoes and garlic.  I think it ruins the flavor a bit. I made a whole batch last St. Patty's day and gave it away because my husband and I didn't like the flavor at all, but other people might.  I would cut down the oil to two tablespoons, and then take out the beef, drain the oil, add a whole bottle and a half of  guinness to get the bits off the bottom, then add the onion and beef back.  I also add beef broth and potatoes to it; the potatoes help to thicken the stew. If you like the flavor of tomato paste and garlic in your stew with less broth, then this is for you!  I agree with the other reviewers that it lacked flavor. I won't make it again.

Brought this to my monthly cooking club & it was a hit.  Followed the recipe, but due to time limitations I prepared in the skillet the night before, then put it in the slow cooker on low and let it cook all day the next day.  I used a full can of guiness beer & also added 1 cup of beef broth to the slow cooker to keep it moist, came out great!

Okay as a base start, but it needs a lot of help otherwise (even AFTER I incorporated a lot of "most helpful reviews" tips). Don't let the picture fool you -- it looks better than it tastes.

What an awesome recipe!! I served this stew over Champ. My family raved about the meal.  I added 24 oz. of Guinness instead of the 1 1/2 cups. I wanted to be sure there was enough gravy. I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used 1 1/2 tsp. dried thyme. I also added about 2 tsps. of sugar, and some Mrs. Dash and celery salt to taste. I thought this recipe was easy to prepare, and so delicious! A definite recommend!

Made this on St. Patty's day instead of the normal corn beef and cabbage and it was a great hit!  I added more beer than called for and it seemed to help keep the flavor around.  And while I love to play with things and change them, there isn't very much I would change with this reciepe...except serve with mashed potatoes and Car Bombs and you have the makings of a great night!

Excellent stew, I cheated a little and used frozen stew vegetables.  I browned the meat and finished the stew in my crockpot.  My family loved this, this will be the only stew recipe I need.

This was delicious!  I added more than a pinch of cayenne pepper and some smoked paprika to the flour mixture.  Also, after adding the first 1/2 cup of beer and bringing it to a boil I then transferred it to a crock pot and cooked on low for 3 hours.  Everyone loved it!  I made the amazingly easy Irish Soda bread recipe from this site to dip in the stew.  I will be making this again!

Wonderful recipe!! I added everything but the cayenne pepper (only because I forgot to buy some) and it was absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it at my St. Patrick's Day dinner. The Guinness made the stew thicken up and gave it a very nice, rich flavor. Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow!!  Used a whole can of Guinness and used Corned Beef in place of the beef stew meat.  Doubled the garlic and tomato paste and added a couple of chopped potatoes.  Browned the meat did everything else as recipe states but then I did put it in the crock pot for 5 hours on low.

I followed the recipe exactly and it had absolutely no flavor.  I ended up having to add a bunch of extra spices and in the end it turned out good, but the recipe as is was very bland.

I omitted the tomato paste and browned the meat in Marsala wine as someone suggested,also I used Guinness Draught beer(shelves were empty of stout). This recipe is fantastic. I served it over green Irish Champ potatoes and also had Irish soda bread.  I will be making this for any time of the year, it is so easy.

I'm sorry, but this was terrible in my opinion. I have never had a meal fall so flat in my life! This had no flavor even after adding brown sugar, bay leaves, & worcestershire sauce. Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly. Very disappointing. This is my first bad review ever--sorry!

I really enjoyed this served or mashed potatoes.... very comforting food!  Next time I'm going to bump up the spices to fit my tastes.  I cooked the whole thing in the crock pot on low all day.  Will make again!  thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe for leftover roast or steak! I add a 1/2 more stout and serve over a crisped baked potato with Kashmiri chili powder garnish.  Undoubtedly my gourmet man's favorite homestlye meal!

Loved this!  Made a few changes based on what I had on hand... used Sam Adams ale vs stout and the flavor was still great!  Used chicken stock vs beef, added a stalk of chopped celery and used several sprigs of fresh thyme.  I allso ommitted the cayenne but used a generous amount of salt & pepper.  I served over mashed potatoes and it was great!  Enjoy:)

Made this with Irish Champ for a St Patrick's day dinner party, everyone loved it!  I added celery, and a bit of brown sugar to balance out the bitterness of the beer.

This turned out so wonderful! I let simmer for about 3 1/2 hours at a very low temperature and the beef was starting to break up it was so tender. I served this with Irish Champ from the site, and that complimented this dish so well. Everyone that tried this said they never had beef stew turn out so tender. I mixed a small amount of cornstarch with cold water and added just before serving to thicken a bit. I will definitely use this often. Thank You!

I also simmered the stew for 3-4 hours in a crockpot instead of on the stove top. It made the beef tender. The beer adds a unique taste to the stew. It was a nice hearty meal. I served over mashed potatoes.

I got scared after I added the stout because it was a little bitter, and I added 1.5 cups of water and added 3 medium potatoes. It probably would have been fine if I had left it alone and let the flavor mellow. It was so good,and better the next day. My husband who usually turns his nose up at stew loved it and asked for it again.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's parents. I had never tried it so I was hesitant to invite company to join us. My worries went out the window upon the first bite by all. Everyone loved the recipe. 
I started by coating meat with flour and browing in a large skillet, added the tomato paste mixed with the small amount of water but then I transferred it to my slow cooker and cooked on low all day. I used 3lbs of lean beef instead of 2 lbs, a 6oz can of tomato paste, a 14.9 ounce can of guinness. Shortly before serving, I added a small amount of gravy master to thicken the sauce a little more. I served it over mashed red potatoes and left the skin on. I will definitely be making this again in the future.

Husband who is a big Guinness fan LOVED it.  I liked it alot too, but the 4 stars because I'm not crazy about beer.  Was a yummy dinner served over mashed potatoes---great idea!!  Will be our traditional St. Patty's day meal from now on.

Great recipe. I used Luv2eat's version here in the reviews and it was awesome. I did add just a little more brown sugar and worestershire sauce and it really gave the dish more flavor. I will make it again. I also served it with Champ as well.

Beef was very tender, but this had no flavour.  I probably quadrupled the spices, added beef bullion, and a tiny bit of soy sauce.  I completely changed the recipe, but mine came out good and my entire family loved it.

Great Recipe! I converted it to work for a crock-pot and added sliced potatos...It was a huge hit on St. Patrick's Day. Not a drop left and I had doubled the recipe! I was printing out the recipe for half the day to give to people.

My new St. Pat's recipe! OH SO GOOD and really easy. I cooked it on the stove until time to add the beer, then moved it to the slow cooker on low for several hours. Used half parsnips/half carrots and served it over mashed potatoes--this has to be the only way! Company raved! Make the easy Irish soda bread from this site to go along.

Made this stew for 93 people for St. Patrick's Day at our local Legion. Purchased the ingredients, gave the recipe to 5 women and we all made the same stew.  It was awesome, we even got a round of applause after dinner!  I will definately make this recipe again and again!  Thanks so much for posting it. I just love having the feature that All Recipes provides to change the quantities up or down with a click of the mouse, sure made shopping for such a large crowd easy!

Love it, I have made this recipe every year for St. Patrick's Day dinner.  My son and his wife make it for me for my birthday dinner almost every year too, it is a family fave.
I make my Irish Soda bread to compliment it, makes a perfect dinner.

I've made this 3 times now and it is excellent. I would give it 5 stars except I had to make some adjustments to the ingredients and changes to the method, but they are primarily for personal taste. Changes;
2 whole cans of Guniness
1 whole small an of tomato paste
2 cups of beef stock
2 sticks of celery
3 rashers of bacon

Method
Cook bacon over medium heat untill crispy
Remove and crumble
Sautee onion, celery, carrot and garlic in bacon fat. remove
Add olive oil and brown beef in SMALL Batches (very important)
Return all beef to dutch oven and mix in flour
Add vegetables, tomato paste, stock and beer. Mix well
Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook for 4-5 hrs untill the beef is very tender and sauce is thick. Stir occasionally.

This resulted in a melt in your mouth beef and a nice thick sauce. The longer cook time also reduces the bitterness of the beer.

Followed the recipe but the flavor was bland, so like others, I added some brown sugar and worcestershire sauce. I also added some beef stock as the mixture was very thick.

This got rave reviews from my friends. I work in a bar, so I was lucky enough to have Guinness right from the keg. I served it with champ as others suggested & with a toasted baguette (no time for irish soda bread).

Really good, hearty. I have a sense that the addition of the tomato paste might not be critical, so, I'm going to try it without it just like a regular stew.

It was nice until I served it on mashed potatoes, as suggested.  Then it completely mixed with the mashed potato to make it a flavorless soupy potato mess.  The potatoes dulled out the flavor of the stew, and the stew overly watered the mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, even before the potatoes, it wasn't amazing enough for me to want to make again.  Not awful, just not particularly noteworthy.

The flavor of the stout is very strong, making for an unusual taste for beef stew.  The meat was wonderfully tender, and it makes a nice gravy.  Bottom line is that although it was good, I prefer regular beef stew.

I made this for the cook along dish at the forum I belong to and I made a few adjustments to the recipe based a little on the review by one of the members. However, I also tried to stick to the recipe as much as possible. I added some new red potatoes, halved or quartered, and didn't chop the carrots but rather bought the slivered kind. I used 3 cloves of crushed garlic, also 3 bay leaves and aside from the Guinness I used an entire can of beef broth, due to the amount of vegetables. A little extra tomato paste than what it was called for and extra Worcestershire sauce. I made it in the Dutch Oven and it smelled wonderful. Here is the huge surprise... my kids loved it! My daughter had a friend over whose mom is Irish and he said that it was better than the one his mother makes. I made this on St. Patrick's Day and I WOULD and am making it again as I'm typing this. Like I said it was a hit. I kind of played with the seasonings a bit and since I didn't have fresh Thyme I used powdered and leaves. I know now that I don't care for Guinness. But liked the recipe!

The beef came out sooo good in this recipe. Though I think the guinness made the carrots and base a bit bitter. I would probably add some brown sugar next time I make this... and more veggies!

I added approx 4 diced potatoes, 1/4 t celery salt, 6 oz tomato paste, 2-3 cloves garlic, 2 bay leaves, paprika, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauces, 3 cups beef broth, and a green pepper since I had it....just threw it all in the crock pot together. I didn't cut up the meat, just let it cook all day and then shredded it.

There is one word for this stew - FANTASTIC!  I took the advice of another and made the Irish Champ (mashed potatoes) on this site, poured the stew over the potatoes, and it was absolutely incredible.  My husband was so impressed with it, he wants me to make it when his parents come to visit!

I made this for St. Patricks Day. Pretty much just the same as the recipe maybe a little more beer. Browned the beef in a pan, sauted onion and garlic. Tossed some of the beer in the pan scraped it then put it all in the Crock Pot added the rest and wow it was awesome. Put it on top of the Champ from this site (with half of the onion) and made some soda bread from another recipe on this site. My friends and family loved it! Oh yeah and finished it off with the Irish Apple Pie recipe also from this site! Thanks a bunch!

I was a little reserved about using just beer because I don't like it, but this turned out great! I couldn't find any Stout beers, so I used Bud Light because my husband drinks it. Everyone loved it and it was great over mashed potatoes. Excellent recipe!

I actually joined the site just to review this recipe. Out of all the recipes I hve tried off AllRecipes, this one was the WORST! It was bland, but at the same time had a bitter after taste. After reading the comments, I even tried browning the meat in a separate serving of Guiness and adding a touch more garlic and some Kosher salt. I added two stalks of celery and four red potators (cut up) and a cup of frozen peas the last hour--no luck. If you are still interested in trying this recipe I'd say try to add some strong beef stock or boullion cubes to turn up the flavor.

So sad.  This looked fabulous and the reviews were so good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It smelled great while it was cooking, but it did not taste nearly as good.  My husband thought it tasted funny.  My mom didn't care for it, and I felt like it was missing something.  I had high hopes and we were all just sadly disappointed.

Good recipe, but didn't have as much stout flavor as I thought it might.  I increased the beer to 2 bottles and a little V8 in place of the tomato paste.  Oh, and I used my slow cooker on low while I was at work for 8 hours.  Tender and yummy though - served over garlic mashed potatoes.

Irish eyes were surely smiling last night after devouring this tasty stew at a family gathering. I took the reccomendation of a prvious poster (luv2eat)and used my crockpot after following all the directions for browning, deglazing, etc. A bit more work, but the flavors are truly more developed by this method. I needed to add very little extra broth and after 4 hrs. on high the meat was as tender as could be. I then added the carrots and continued cooking on low for another 2 hrs. Served over smashed garlic potatoes it was everything I had hoped for. Good thing I doubled the recipe!

Very good flavor, and very filling.  However the serving sizes were off.  We added extra meat and stuff and barely fed four people.  I would double the recipe automatically.

my family came in town from half way across the country. This was the perfect dish. I used a slow cooker and it was ready when they got here. Everyone loved it, though we all have different tastes. I did use bacon and extra guiness as many suggested. Came out wonderful.

As a native New Englander I have eaten my fair share of beef stew from a variety of cooks. This recipe put every previous spoonful of stew to shame.  The taste was awesome.  This recipe has redefined for me waht stew should be.  It is the gold standard of stew.

Made this as the star of our St. Patrick's Day meal (costarring Irish Champ, from this site, and Irish Soda Bread V, also from allrecipes.com).  It was a wonderful meal - husband kept exclaiming over it and 17 month old daughter clamored for "more! more! more!"  Once I was able to eat my own serving, I agreed with them wholeheartedly!  "MORE!"

This was ok. Actually a bit bland, could've used more garlic and onions and herbs. The meat was really tender.

This stew recipe is a regular one in our house.  We’re getting ready to make it again today in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day!  A few reviewers mentioned the stew being less flavorful than they expected.  We’ve learned to add more than a pinch of cayenne pepper when we dredge the beef.  We also add more salt toward the end.  These minor additions really kick up the flavor.  This stew is a wonderful meal, especially over mashed potatoes.  Enjoy!

Pretty good recipe, but I expected more.  It need more flavor.  Went really good with the whole wheat Irish Soda bread recipe.

My family and myself were very unimpressed with this.  Everyone agreed that it was lacking "something" in regards to a spice.  I've only just starting cooking, so I'm not familiar enough with spices yet to know what to add.  I've never eaten Irish stew before, so maybe it's meant to taste bland.

This was an easy satisfying meal.  I did 3/4 Guiness and 1/4 beef stock but I think next time I'll use all Guiness.  The beer taste wasn't nearly as strong as I expected it to be.  I liked the simplicity of it and will definitely make this again.  I served it over mashed potatoes and found that to be a great combination.

Easy. Browned items on stove, transferred to crockpot. Removed some of stew to smaller pot before adding tomato paste, for sick friend who's allergic to tomatoes. Have to report that tomato paste made all  the difference in this dish. My portion was delish! This reinforces my theory on tomato paste...if recipe calls for it don't leave it out and don't substitute. The Guinness added such flavor. My new go to beef stew recipe!!

Recipe is fine as far as it goes. However, the photo clearly shows potatoes, which makes perfect sense for an Irish dish. That should match the recipe text, which has no potatoes in it.

This stew was awesome. Did use more than a pinch of all the seasonings for taste preference. Beef was super moist and sauce was perfectly thickened after a 3 hour slow simmer.

I modified it to be gluten free by substituting the beer with half beef stock and half V8 juice. I also added small potatoes and celery. It turned out awesome.

Very tasty, but I made a few changes after reading other reviewers' comments. I added 3-4 diced potatoes, 1 celery stalk chopped, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce and 1-4 cup of brown sugar.  I cooked bacon in 1 tbsp. oil and 1 tbsp. butter, removed bacon and cooked flour coated meat in drippings, instead of oil.  Even my daughter who claims to dislike stew had two helpings!

We really enjoyed this but I found that the ratio of beef to veggies was off so I used three times the amount of carrots. There are a number of steps that could be eliminated by adding the oil to the dutch oven, giving it a good stir and then adding the flour...far fewer dishes and it won't effect the flavour. I cooked this in the oven for 1 1/2 hours @ 350 and the meat was very tender. If I were to make this again I would sub diced tomatoes for the paste. Thanks!

I have been making this recipe for years and everyone seems to love it! Sometimes I’ll serve it over mash potatoes and sometimes I’ll put cubes potatoes in with the carrots, either way everyone seems to love it. Great on the stove top or in the slow cooker.

I followed the recipe...totally.  I couldn't believe the "most helpful positive review" OR the "most helpful critical review".  The most helpful...added so much it wasn't even the original anymore! The most critical...I don't  understand their problem with it.  Seriously... I made NO changes and my family loved it!  OK...add a little more salt.  My husband...big critic...really enjoyed this!  I've made it twice now and love it.  The Irish Soda Bread with it is PERFECT!

I followed the recipe (but added a bit extra tomato paste with water mixture.). The smell is incredible and the stew's gravy is rich and kind of thick. I've tried other Guiness stew recipes but this one is the best.

I am now making my second batch of this stew.  I will be honest I am unfortunately born with taste buds that do not like alcohol so I didn't know how I was going to do this.  I used O'douls dark amber for the recipe. I will be honest, it does need a tad bit of sugar so I added it in.  The O'douls works beautifully in this stew.  This recipe is definitely in my recipe box.

Keeper!  I followed the recipe as written except I used dried thyme.  My two picky eaters gobbled it up!  This will go in my menu rotation and I will adapt to pressure cooker.

this is like a recipe I used to make:  Beer Beef, a recipe from an Irish cook book, but this had a few more flavor adding ingredients, including garlic and carrots.
I did as the old recipe suggested and cooked it at 275 for 4 hours, which allows the meat to fall apart when forked.  A nice touch the old recipe had was a large slice of bread spread both sides with mustard and place on top before baking.

If you love the taste of beef, you will love this.  It is one of my favorite recipes.  I add potatoes sometimes. 
Don't wait for St. Patrick's Day to make it.

Just what you expect:  hearty and flavorful. Since I made this for the fam, I added a half cup of honey to cut the bitter/tang of the Guinness a little and it worked great. With sourdough toast, it was a perfect fall meal.

This was yummy.  Perfect for fall and winter.  I went a little overboard with the cayenne because I tossed it in rather than measuring.  Would be very good with quartered potatoes too.  I plan to try that next time.  Thanks for sharing!
