Light, buttery, crispy, crackly, chewy, pretty and delicious all describe this cookie.  I used chocolate covered, candy coated sunflower seeds and the optional coconut which made these especially pretty and different. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to heighten flavor. I refrigerated my dough about an hour, used a small cookie scoop not bothering to flatten them at all, and found they spread just the right amount - not too flat, not too poofy. Nice balance of flavors between the oatmeal, sunflower seeds and coconut. I would have to call this a nearly perfect cookie. I dare you to eat just one!

I made these cookies with whole wheat flower and they turned out great!  I also left out the coconut.  I brought them to work and they were a hit!

Yum...I love sunflower seeds and oatmeal cookies and this is a great mixture of both...I went a bit further I added mini chocolate chips and turned them into a bar cookie...it is a great easy way to get a great cookie and takes less time...Baked approx 20 minutes...depends on your oven. Baked the bar cookie on a extra large professional bakers sheet and covered with aluminum foil, inverted when cool..and peeled off the alumimun foil...lots of bars..THANKS!

These are great! 4 stars because they are a little on the dry side. I feel like they could use some olive oil, more butter, or something? I added 1 cup raisins & 1 cup very finely chopped sunflower seeds. I used Amish vanilla extract, which gives it a nice rich flavor. My children love these and I don't feel as guilty about the sugar and fat when the "healthy" ingredients far outway the "unhealthy". Sunflower seeds and whole oats are so beneficial to our health, and I think most parents would find it hard to get their child to eat a handful of sunflower seeds alone! Great recipe. Will make again, next time adding some extra virgin olive oil.

Many people tried these cookies and everyone thought they were awesome!  I used 1 c. whole wheat flour and added a bit of ground flax. Will make again for sure.

excellent!  I used salted roasted sunflower seeds and they add such a delicious and different crunch.  The second batch I made I added m&ms.  I can see all sorts of yummy additions...all very good.  Easy to make too.

The perfect cookie. Everyone loved these. They are slightly chewy, a little crispy on the outside and the buttery, nutty flavor is delicious. Followed the recipe, including the optional coconut (I will include it next time again) except used fall colored chocolate covered sunflower seeds. These were gone in one day and hubby and all the kids have asked for them again. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful cookie!
I did not add coconut...so no comment there.
I did not have vanilla so I added almond extract with gave the cookie another layer of nutty flavor! YUM.
Then I experimented....
I made some plain (my husband will love)
I made some with chocolate chips -- they are good
I made some with butterscotch chips - fabulous
I made some with raisins - awesome.
What a GREAT recipe!  Thanks.

These were okay, but it could be b/c I used lowfat butter and Splenda in them. I might try again but I will try it with the real stuff.

I made these cookies to use up a bag of sunflower seeds I had purchased for another recipe.  Usually my family dislikes nuts and seeds, but they loved these cookies!  Next time I may try adding raisins, as suggested, or some other type of dried fruit.

I left out the coconut (don't like it) I made these for Winter Solstice, so I dip them in yellow sugar before baking - the sugar formed a sort of crust on the top of the cookie - I think that they are really great - let's see what the others think at the Solstice celebration - I'm always looking for Solstice treats and these fit the bill because of the sunflower seeds

I LOVE these cookies!  I omitted the coconut, since I didn't have any.  I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I had some sunflower seeds that really needed to be used up, and nothing to put them in.  The first batch I followed exactly.  The second batch, however, I put almond extract instead of vanilla, and chocolate chips to add a little sweetness for the sweet-tooths in the family.  Wonderful recipe!  I'll be keeping it in my recipe box from now on. :) Thank-you so much for sharing!

Great tasting cookie!  Love the soft, chewy texture that the higher ratio of brown sugar gives them.    My husband does not like coconut and absolutely loved these.  I'm sure the texture was masked by the rolled oats!  ;-) Added dried cranberries to these for a cookie exchange and they were well received.  I would like to try adding flax seed to them the next time I make them.  Thanks for sharing!

I like the unique flavor the sunflower seeds lend this traditional oatmeal cookie! Nutty in a way that peanuts, walnuts, pecans, etc cannot provide - I enjoyed the change! I think they would be great with chocolate covered sunflower seeds, as some reviewers suggested. I didn't realize I ran out of coconut, which I'm sure would be tasty too! --A great oatmeal cookie recipe overall; I enjoyed the chewiness that they have maintained in the container. Give it a shot! (PS: I used roasted unsalted seeds... so I added about 1/2 tsp salt to compensate.)

I made this recipe and liked it, but I think I should have left out the coconut. It took away from the flavor of the sunflower seeds. Next time I make this recipe, I will definitely add 1/4 cup more of the seeds and raisins.(It feels like it is missing something) I think it will make the cookie more complete. Otherwise, good recipe!

I made this recipe for my husband who doesn't like "too much sweet" (is there such a thing?)  Anyway--he REALLY liked these.  The flavor is excellent and unusual.  They taste very healthy even if they're not especially healthy.  It's great for a snack cookie or just something different.  I also left out the coconut.  I bet mini chocolate chips would be outstanding in these!  This recipe is now in my "family favorites cookbook".  Thanks!

Yum yum yum!  I followed the recipe with the exception of the coconut - I cut it in half and added chocolate chips.  Awesome.  I will make it next time according to the recipe as I think it will be wonderful, I was just serving them to people who like chocolate.  These are great - thanks for the recipe!

although these cookies had a nice buttery taste, i only gave them 2 stars because they turned out more like a praline cookies then an oatmeal cookie. i will go back to my tried and true oatmeal cookies recipe and add the sunflower seeds to it.

My family did not like this cookie.  I thought it was acceptable but not exciting.  I didn't add the coconut (and probably should have).  Also, the sunflower seeds that I used were roasted but didn't go well with "sweet".  That may have been part of the problem.  People who love nutty, "healthy" kinds of tastes will like this cookie.  Adding chocolate chips helped.

This was a great recipe.  I one and a half cup of brown sugar (no white sugar), and substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of the all purpose flour.  It turned out so soft and chewy in the middle and nice and crisp on the outside.  Will definitely make again, this time with no while flour.

There was a very serious issue with this cookie that you failed to mention in your recipe, Brett...

...they are dangerously addictive!! =)

I only changed the recipe slightly:  I was about 1/4 c. short on sunflower seeds, chose to omit the coconut, and added a bag of chocolate chips.  I also took SEBSRB's advice and made cookie bars in a foil-covered jellyroll pan using(which worked beautifully!).

This one is definitely a keeper.  A wonderfully versatile cookie that would be great with raisins, dried cranberry, walnuts... the possibilities are endless!

The only thing I would do differently next time is make a double batch - my family managed to polish them off in ONE NIGHT.

Thanks so much for these... they are perfect!

A great cookie. I did a pan cookie in a jelly roll pan, then cut into squares. I mixed the flour, baking powder, soda, sunflower seeds and oatmeal together before adding to the butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla. A real keeper for my family.

These cookies are awesome!  With the coconut, they stay chewy, and the sunflower seeds are a favorite!

These are phenominal! Make sure your sunflower seeds are salted and roasted (and not just plain!) -this makes a huge difference.  Also make sure you are using rolled oats - they are bigger and take longer to cook and will give a different consistency.  You can use quick oats - they will observe more moisture in the cookies and have less texture but I highly recommend the rolled oats.  You cannot use instant oats - they are not interchangable!  I substituted wheat flour for all of the white flour and noticed no difference in flavor.  Finally I added dried cranberries for a sweet bite which brought everything together.  Love these cookies!

I made these as written except omitted the coconut, and added semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The cookie is chewy and buttery.  The only thing that I was very disappointed about was the fact that the sunflower seeds just disappeared into the cookie, no crunch or even sunflower seed flavor in my opinion.  So I will make the cookie as an Oatmeal Cookie but not bother with sunflower seeds.

I actually made this recipe from a clipping I cut out of a magazine. I just happened to be searching for other recipes and saw that you posted the recipe I just made. These are actually really good. Thanks for posting the recipe!

I made these exactly as the recipe describes, they were good.  I love coconut and I like sunflower seeds, but I think I would like them better as coconut-raisin oatmeal cookies.  I'm going to take them in to work tomorrow for additional opinions. I would make them again though.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe!  The sunflower seeds are a delicious and healthy change!  I didn't have enough white sugar so I added 1/3 cup of white sugar and 2/3 cup of Splenda with no issues.  Also, I flattened a few before they went into the oven and put about 1/2 tsp of jam on them and baked for the recommended time.  Delish!!!

I make this recipe for my elderly parents and mail it to them. The cookies pack and mail well, are crispy and buttery but not too sweet, and a great hit with all.

These are good cookies.  I added chocolate chips to mine. I also had to bake them about 3-4 min extra.  They do spread too.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have found yet.  My family loves it!  Also, great for camping as they are really hearty cookies.  I also skip the coconut but I add chocolate chips.  Yum!

These are very tasty! They have a nice nutty flavor and add a change from your typical oatmeal or PB cookie.

I used this cookie as a base. I followed exactly except that I added pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries and raisins, along with the sunflower seeds and coconut. They held together wonderfully and had a great texture, both crisp

I happened to pick up a jar of sunflower seed really cheap, so I searched for sunflower seed recipes and found this.  Glad I did, they are really good!  I only added sprinkles on top, no other changes.
