Super recipe!!  Much less time consuming than similar  recipes where you roast the pecans separately.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt and used half white, half brown sugar.  In place of cayenne, I used cardamom, one of my favorite spices.  Many thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

One word- ADDICTING!  I used almost a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 4 1/2 cups pecans in the mix since there was an ample amount of coating.  I only used 3/4 stick of melted butter in the bottom of my lines baking sheet to avoid the pecans becoming too greasy.  Fabulous!

I made it per the recipe, except I used golden monkfruit instead of sugar, as I am trying to stick to keto...and I love glazed nuts!  So, I felt like the recipe was a great addition to my keto recipes to keep me from falling off the wagon!

I followed the ingredients to the letter, but cooked it for 30 minutes. I will be making this again.

This was a first for me.  I have never made sugar coated nuts in any form.  I followed the instructions, adding a 1/2 tsp salt, and the pecans turned out delicious! I made two batches.  After guestimating the cayenne the first time, I measured 1/4 tspn the next round, which adds just barely enough spice.  The only thing I would emphasize is use a timer.  The second round as I was tossing at one point I forgot to restart my timer, and I overcooked a tad.  Or maybe the oven was warmer.  Whatever the case, don't overbake these!

I made this recipe and it is one of the easiest and best recipes!  Very simple and cooking them in the melted butter makes the glaze!  These make wonderful Christmas gifts!    Happy Holidays!

Easy to make for gifts or a snack. The perfect blend of flavors that will have you coming back for more. Don't over cook, these were done in 15 minutes.

I’ve made these several times and at times included walnuts and almonds.  They’re absolutely delicious!  They also make great gifts - just decorate (or not) an 8 or 16 oz Mason jar and you have a delicious gift that’s sure to please.

I made these per the recipe and they were neither sweet or spicy. They were also rather greasy feeling from all the butter.

Followed instructions. Think next time I will bake a little longer. 30 minutes.   Still delicious.

I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  Needs extra cayenne for kick.  Cooked 30 minutes.
