Bless you for submitting this recipe.  My aunt willed me her 100 yr. old German
cookie mold but took her recipe to the grave.  I think this is very close to the 
cookies I remember eating as a child.  I loved them!  It worked out quite well with
the hand carved mold as long as the dough was kept cold.  A little additional
flour improved the detail of the mold designs.  I never knew the name of the
cookie until now, but believe the spelling would be Weinachstollen.

Almost like those windmill cookies you can buy in the store. However I still felt like it was missing a little something? I think it maybe a bit of salt, because these are not very sweet. Maybe a touch of salt would make the sweetness pop out a little.

Thank you!! These taste almost exactly like my Grandma Wagner's cookies. I know she used lard. My cookbook from her calls them "Weihnachtstrollen"

Sorry I gave these such a bad review.  I ate these fresh from the oven, and it was a big mistake.  After setting these are a very good cookie.  I make them most years for Christmas.

I just wanted to take another stab at the actual name of these cookies...Weihnachtsrollen might be a possibility (christmas 'rolls').  Weihnachtsstollen is a common Christmas bread, also, but I have never seen it in the form of a cookie.

I've never tried anything like this before, so I will take others for their word as to the authenticity.  All I can really say is that it's a large, somewhat flavorless, soft cookie.   I'm glad I tried it.

This is such a fabulous recipe.  The cookies are ridiculously addictive.  I make them every Christmas.  And I have to stop myself from eating them because I give them as gifts.  But I don't tell people about the lard, for some reason, that turns them off.  Whatever, heaven in your mouth I say!

These are wonderful and not too sweet which is just how I like it. The lard makes them kind of high in the calorie department though, so if you're counting calories, limit yourself to about one cookie a day!
