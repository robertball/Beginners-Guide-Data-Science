Good recipe. I made 2 batches, one with curry and one without (sorta had to, because what do you with half a can of chickpeas).  Vastly prefer the batch without the curry.  I also followed the previous reviewers advice to limit water.  Perfect texture.

Instead of using curry, I substituted 1 tsp of cumin.  I also added more garlic and lemon for a stronger flavor.  It was one of the best hummus recipes I've ever tried!

I wouldn't quite call this hummus, exactly, but it certainly is delicious!

I skipped the curry powder and water, doubled the garlic and added a bit more lemon juice than the original recipe called for. Great with pita bread, tortilla chips, Ritz crackers or rolled up in a tortilla with veggies as a southwestern wrap!

I enjoyed this hummus. I left out the water because I like mine thicker and added a little more garlic. Turned out really well, will be making again.

Oh my this is my new favorite bean dip/spread/hummus!! Absolutely wonderful! The only change I made was to leave out the olive oil, use less water, double the garlic and left out the curry. My daughter loved it as well and it made a great dip for a healthy evening snack with lowfat pretzels. We will try it on bread for sandwiches tomorrow. We WILL be making this one often!! Simple, inexpensive, healthy and delicious! A definite winner in my book!

I made this last night for a late evening snack and followed it to the letter.  My husband and I loved it!

DH suggested it would be good as a sandwich spread when making wraps. I think I know what I'm doing with the leftovers!

Just made this for the first time, it is easy to make and very good. I decided to make it a little more spicy and added 4 fresh jalapenos.

I have already made this several times! I love it and it had tons of flavor for me! Make sure you add fresh garlic and add more or less of the ingredients to suit your taste! It's so easy and so delicious! My good friend said it was the best hummus she has ever had! Enjoy!

This was pretty good!  I used the whole can of both black beans and chickpeas, so I doubled the remaining ingredients, as another reviewer did.  Instead of curry, I added a Tbs of Cumin.  I also left out the water.  Goes great with tortilla and pita chips, veggies, or can be used as sandwich spread.

First, I read other reviews for tips and alterations and then added my own ... I also substituted the curry for cumin - I love cumin and used 3 heaping tsps (double the recipe). I didn't have lemon juice, however I had lime juice concentrate and used 3 tbsps of that and just a splash of water. I too pumped up the amount of garlic (2 cloves) and the end result was absolutely delicious!   This dip is very creamy and I wonder if I couldn't play w/ the ratio of garbanzo to black beans so that it's truer to a heartier hummus consistency. I feel like I'd like to add fresh cilantro to the mix as well!   This is a great, easy, healthful recipe that's foolproof and can be customized to taste! So glad I found it!

I agree with some others; this isn't exactly hummus.  However, I gave it a go because I really liked the idea of using blacks bean and yogurt.  I found the consistency somewhat waning, and the yogurt taste distracting.  I think I will try this again for sure because I love the idea of it, but I'll probably play around with the olive oil (i.e add much more and not use yogurt).

I only subbed cumin for curry as others had, only because I discovered I was out!  I also used rehydrated chick peas and black beans.  This is not hard to do you only need 2 hours to make dried beans usable, much better flavor and WAY cheaper.

Very Yummy!!  Thanks for a great tahini-free recipe, I can't get it in my area.  This is the 3rd recipe for hummus I have tried and the 3rd time's the charm!  I like the flavor of the 2 beans together though the color is a little unappealing.  I didn't have any curry and didn't use salt or pepper either. I also used the liquid from the chick peas instead of the water.  The blender worked better than the food processor, it was much smoother than my first 2 tries.

This is a tough one to rate because it's not hummus.  There's no hummus without tahini, so if I were to rate it as a hummus, I'd give it two stars.  HOWEVER, as a bean dip to go with nachos or chips and salsa, it's spectacular.  After I realized it wasn't made to be eaten with naan or pita, I opted for some good 'ol tortilla chips with a little salsa on the side.  It's very good for that purpose.

Great base for a dip & sandwich spread, although I wouln't exactly call it hummus.  I liked the curry, but i'll probably skip it next time and go for more traditional hummus flavors (more garlic, lemon, cilantro, etc...)

i'm sorry, but hummus without tahini is not hummus. it's bean dip.  that being said, this was cheap to make and reasonably tasty. i'm vegan, so i subbed a bit of almond milk for the yoghurt. nice recipe for a cheap and healthful dip. :)

Excellent! I did add a bit more garlic (personal preference) and omitted the yogurt (simply for lack of it), and it came out perfectly. The curry powder is an excellent touch.

This was plain at best...simply a spin off of refried beans in my opinion.   Who ever said this was "the best hummus they have ever had" has obviously never had hummus- I laughed when I read that their "Indian friend" raved over this.  The only thing I could do to get this eaten was smear it on whole wheat tortillas, add cheese and sour cream- and tell my family it was bean burritos.  very disappointing recipe.

Made without the yogurt and subbed cayenne for the curry. Also used half lemon and half lime juice. I think it's yummy but my husband ranks it as"I'd eat it, but it's not great."

I started with Holly's Hummus recipe:  I doubled the recipe, estimated the measurements, substituted lime for lemon juice and omitted the cilantro. I left the pimento in the green olives.  Added powdered hot red pepper.   It was good, even very good, but not great.  So I looked at the Black Bean and Chickpea Hummus recipe and borrowed the black beans and curry powder from it.  If I had grilled sweet red peppers on hand I would have added them also.  I had organic yogurt on hand but didn't use it.  It came out great and with 2 cans of chick peas and one can of black beans it was enough for me to bring to the girls at work for another game of "Look what I made!"  I gave it 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for as a base to make my own.  I gave the same review to Holly's Hummus recipe since they are both very similar and yet have individually important ingredients.  Credit to you both!

I found this to be lacking in flavor a lot. I'd prefer to make regular tahini hummus over this anyday.  I tried it as a spread with melted cheese and salsa though and that was an improvement...but still not worth a second go.

I don't agree with giving a recipe 5 stars if you make changes, which is why I'm giving this one 4.  Actually as is, it's more a 3.5.  The curry really doesn't belong.  We made it according to the recipe the first time and all 4 of us who had it agreed the curry didn't belong.  We made it again without curry.  We added more garlic, some taco seasoning, cumin, chili powder and cayenne powder.  I'd give this version 5 stars.

Ok, I'll admit this was fabulous, but I made a lot of changes, based on what I had in the pantry.  I used a large can of black beans no garbanzo beans and substituted sour cream for the yogurt.  Then, I only used a sprinkle of curry powder and added some cumin.  After sitting in the fridge all night, the flavors had blended together beautifully.  Yes, it's a funny color but with some pita chips it was yummy.  Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good. I'm not sure about the curry powder. I used only 1/3 of the amount it called for and thought that was enough for me.

This is a fantastic alternative to regular hummus.  It's great with tortilla chips, any vegetables, or smeared on a tortilla with some veggies.  My husband loves it and it's great for when I have that 1/2 can of black beans that I need to use up!

For a little sweetness try vanilla yogurt instead of plain and omit the curry powder.  I certainly enjoyed it!

Super tasty. Instead of curry powder, I used the harissa spice mix from Savory Spice Shop. It's very good!

WOW!!!  This might not be "authentic" without the tahini....but it sure does taste fabulous.  Made a double batch and my friends and I couldn't stay out of it.  So healthy, delicious and addictive!

This was GREAT!  As other reviewers suggested I subbed 1 tsp cumin for the curry powder.  Super easy to make and super yummy AND healthy!  I made it for a BBQ and got a lot of compliments.  I love that it doesn't use tahini as that is very hard to find in my grocery stores.  Will be a regular at our house!

Yummy! Like a couple of reviewers before me, I didn't add the curry and I left out the water. I also doubled the recipe. My favorite "dipper" - cauliflower.

Very good as a dip! It doesn't give me the hummus taste I crave though. I think it tastes better without the curry, as the garlic is nice enough.

This is really good  recipe.  I used hot curry powder, it was not for the faint of heart.  The Texans loved it.  When using canned beans, you may not need a lot of salt.

This was so easy!   I used garlic,  cumin, and paprika,  and instead of water I used fat and salt free chicken broth.  It could use a little more seasoning,  and I may add a bit more yogurt to make it more creamy.   I also used a little sesame oil.   Took a taste right out of the processor on a thin pretzel,  it's wonderful!

This was good. I like the idea of subbing cumin for the curry powder though, and will probably do that next time. I think going with all black beans might be a nice thing to try too.

Very good!!!  I doubled the recipe, and also I did not have the correct ingredients.   I had to sub sour cream for plain yogurt, and bottled lemon juice for fresh lemons, and I still loved it!  I can't wait to make again w/ fresh lemons and plain yogurt.  Other than that I I followed the recipe, probably using an extra clove of garlic.  I am a late night snacker so I will feel good about having this healthy treat (and look forward to it too).  I plan to have w/ fresh, raw veggies next time.

I used red beans instead of black (my local grocery didn't have it). The outcome was still delicious! I used 1 tsp of cumin instead of curry. I doubled the lemon juice but I thought it became too tangy. It's really good nonetheless!

pretty good, makes ALOT of dip. I skipped out on the curry and water, instead of yogurt i used a spoonful of creamcheese.  I also added some peprika.  Makes an excellent snack.  Also if i "looks" gross as so many people have stated......garnish!!! makes all the difference.

This actually tasted REALLY good, but I'm not sure I'll make it again. Visually it was really unappetizing-looking because of the color. It wasn't obvious it was hummus since the black beans made it a yucky color.

Quite delicious! I added an extra squeeze of lemon, one more clove of garlic and excluded the water as other reviewers suggested.
