I tripled this recipe and used frozen bananas and my strawberries and blueberries were also frozen which meant I didn't need the ice. This was good, I liked the double dose of vanilla but I think it needs more berries.

Just to let you guys know, you do not have to slice the bananas or strawberries, but the banana does have to be halved. If you use bananas, make sure you peel them before you freeze them. I hope you guys like the smoothie!

Wow, this is a great Smoothie!  My two daughters kept saying "Yummy".  I used a whole frozen banana, added two more strawberries, frozen blueberries and omitted the ice cubes.  Thank you so much Martha and her Daughter!

Delicious!  Very healthy and easy for a quick breakfast!  I used fat free yogurt and skim milk to cut down on calories and fat but you'd never know from the taste.

Nice smoothie!  I didn't have any banana so I added more strawberries instead.  I also added 1 Tbsp of flax seed.  Since I didn't have anything frozen in there it could have used a bit more ice.

One of the main reasons I don’t generally care for yogurt smoothies is just that - too much yogurt.  I’d rather eat a carton of yogurt with some fruit on the side.  So what I particularly enjoyed about this smoothie was its lower proportion of yogurt relative to the amount of fruit. What really surprised me, however, is that Hubs agreed, and he does love his yogurt smoothies.  I cut back on the vanilla just a tad, and sweetened it lightly with honey. My fruit was only partially frozen so I still used the ice cubes and was happy I did – this was nice and frosty cold.  Beautiful color and good berry taste as this was not as heavy on the banana flavor as some smoothies including it can be.

A great fruit smoothie that my kids and I love.  They would never eat blueberries on their own, but they'll drink them!  I add honey to make this a little sweeter and about a tablespoon of flax seed just to sneak in some fiber!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made just this morning and it turned out great! Delicious, fresh, and gone within seconds. Unfortuneately, my whole ice cubes didn't crush, so I took crushed ice cubes from the fridge instead, it worked perfectly. Thanks for this recipe!

Very yummy.  I used frozen blueberries, frozen banana, fresh strawberries.  I used fat-free milk and I also added about 2 T. honey and it was excellent.  Thank you for posting this great smoothie recipe!

My 12 year old made for his brother and himself last night and they both really liked it.  Did not slice the strawberries, just threw it all in the Magic Bullet.  Definitely going into his smoothie book.

This is probably one of my most favorite smoothies I've made, and I love the beautiful lavender color.  I used an unfrozen banana, the strawberries, frozen blueberries, skim milk, nonfat vanilla yogurt, and omitted the vanilla extract because I added vanilla protein powder. I also used 8 ice cubes to make it colder and slushier. Delicious and only 2 Weight Watchers PointsPlus.

Pretty good...I made mine without bananas (allergic) and used blackberries instead of blueberries (didn't have any).  I also added a little honey.  It was a refreshing treat.

This is good, I love smoothies... :)  I used plain yogurt and no vanilla extract.  For those looking to add even more "healthy" to it, add walnuts (if not allergic to nuts) and instead of honey use (granulated like sugar) Stevia (not Truvia; use Stevia - health food stores).  Also, to hull your strawberries, push a straw up through the bottom of the strawberry through the top and out.  It should remove the top (or most of it) and hull your strawberry at the same time. :)

Excellent recipe. Made it for the 7 kids I was watching today and everyone gave it two thumbs up. My strawberries and blueberries were already frozen so I did not need to freeze the bananas or use ice cubes.

I make smoothies for my kids almost everyday.  They are not big fans of bananas, but I thought I would sneak one in anyway.  They could all tell that there was one in there, so they didn't finish drinking it.  I thought it was very good, and ended up drinking most of it.  This was very refreshing and "healthy" tasting.  I think that it would make a really nice pre or post work-out drink.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious.  I used frozen blueberries, but I froze my own banana (halved) and fresh strawberries (tops removed).  I didn't use vanilla extract, but I used frozen vanilla yogurt.  If you want to make a protein shake, add a scoop of protein powder.  Delicious!!!

Refreshing smoothie, as nice as one you would buy at Orange Julius.  I didn't have time to freeze my banana and accidentally picked up cherry vanilla yogurt, but they still turned out delicious.

I started with this recipe as a base but I use low-fat organic ban-illa yogurt (4 Tablespoons), and forgo the milk. I also throw in a few more ice cubes.  It's so delicious!

Made this for breakfast today.  Next time, I'll add more banana, as I think that flavor was not as prominent as I would have liked.  Nice, easy smoothie with good flavor.

Very yummy recipe.  None of the flavors were overpowering, but complimentary of each other.  My banana and strawberries were frozen, so no additional ice was needed.

I thought this was a pretty good blueberry smoothy. I liked that it wasn't too sweet tasting. I doubled the recipe and got about 3 servings. I put leftover fruit in the freezer, so I used frozen strawberries and blueberries. I only had plain yogurt and not vanilla, and used that along with a packet of Truvia. For the milk I used 2%. I think the frozen berries, I used, made it nice and cold. I will make this again. Edit note: I tried it again, exactly as written using the vanilla yogurt suggested, while still using a fresh banana and frozen berries and it was very good to.

Yummm !  I love that this recipe doesn't use juice.  It's sooo good, which I attribute in large part to the vanilla extract. Delicioso !!

Hubby finally brought home some blueberries for me this weekend, so I just had to try this recipe. I added a few more strawberries and because the banana was frozen, I didn't need the ice. The vanilla in this gave the shake such a nice touch. Thank you so much Mary; I loved it!!

I love this recipe! Followed recipe exactly - no changes. This is a great combination of fruits. I have been making different smoothie recipes for quite some time. I am always leary about using yogurt but this recipe is awesome. I was worried about using the bananas at first because I did not want an overpowering banana flavor. But I was amazed at how great it tasted.

This was absolutely amazing! It replaces our favorite smoothie recipe from Disney we had been using for years. I did have to make two minor alterations based on what I had on hand. Our fruit was fresh so I added more ice cubes than what was called for in the recipe. Also, we had blueberry/pomegrante yogurt instead of vanilla. I couldn't tell much of a difference in taste as the flavor of the vanilla extract is what really comes through. To me it tasted similar to cotton candy, without being too sweet and without all the extra sugar. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Great basic smoothie recipe. Has the correct order of ingredients so as not to overload the blender. I mixed and matched fruit according to what I had (strawberries and bananas)  and used some chocolate flavored almond milk along with greek style yogurt and the honey. Came out great! The kids liked it too! Great spring/summer treat instead of milkshakes.

The fruit smoothie was very good and my kids loved it too. Instead of using frozen yogurt, i used plain vanilla ice cream. I don't like blueberries, so i used more bananas and strawberries.It still turned out wonderful.

Can taste mostly the banana, but I think if i use less banana next time, will be able to taste the other fruit flavors more. I didn't use any ice and replaced the milk with almond milk as well..yummy!!

This was really good! I quadrupled the recipe and made it for my kids when they came home from school. It was a big hit! I used frozen strawberries and frozen blueberries and only one banana. (I might leave out the banana next time. Great color!!!

This recipe was very good, thanks. :) I used frozen blueberries and omitted the ice, and b/c I didn't have vanilla yogurt, I used strawberry yogurt, I also omitted the vanilla extract as I didn't want the added sweetness.

I expected more flavor, but I think I didn't stir the yogurt enough. Maybe I put too much vanilla. I might try again in the future.

I freeze all of the fruit to make it nice and thick and add a scoop of vanilla protein powder to make it a protein powerhouse!  I also vary the yogurt flavors!  Yummy!

I have been making this for quite some time. However, I don't add ice. I use frozen banana, frozen mixed berries, milk, vanilla, plain non-fat yogurt, and Splenda. The taste is fantastic, and the smoothies are very thick.

I used all frozen fruit so I omitted the ice. but it also made it necessary to add extra milk and yoghurt to get it to blend. I also used plain yoghurt and left out the vanilla.  To me it mostly tastes like banana with a hint of blueberry, but there's no indication of strawberries being in there at all!. So I would recommend either increasing the strawberries or leaving them out entirely.

It was pretty good. I was surprised at the high carbs and calorie counts. I made it with low fat milk and low fat yogurt so maybe that brought the counts down.

This smoothie recipe is absolutely amazing. It's my go-to recipe on weekends because it includes everything I normally eat for breakfast! I always tweak smoothies to what I have (which is usually always the same) So I use plain yogurt, don't freeze the banana, and don't use ice cubes. The best smoothie recipe I've encountered so far.

I made this recipe as directed minus substituting the milk for 2%, and the yogurt for light vanilla yogurt. This recipe was so quick and easy! I absolutely love the delicious blend of fruits, and I definitely will be making this again.
