Finally got around to trying these out and they are great.  Due to health reasons hubby can't eat white or whole wheat flour so I substituted 1/3 brown rice flour, 1/3 oat flour and 1/3 quinoa flour and used raw honey.  They are one of the best cookie recipes I've tried on thsi web site.  I even threw in flax seed and used almond milk.  The grandson loves them also.  Thx for the great recipe.

As a pastry cook, I can honestly say that this is one of the easiest cookie doughs I have ever rolled out.  It cuts out beautifully and tastes delicious! To increase the fibre in it for my family, I actually ground up 1 cup oats and 1/4 cup oat bran instead of the 1 1/4 c. oats. Still delicious!

These cookies are SO, SO good! Do NOT skimp out on the Oat Flour...it is KEY!! They are very simple tasting, not filled with complexity, yet completely savory. They are a perfect treat for children and adults to make together for the holidays, or as an "anytime snack". These cookies can be cut very thin, or somewhat thick...just watch them closely in the oven to see that they don't burn or "over brown". Use just a small amount of icing, for these cookies only need a tiny amount, just enough to get your decorations to stick. Enjoy!

Great recipe!  Super easy to roll and cut.  The first batch was very bland, so I added 1 small box of instant french vanilla pudding to the second batch and it was perfect.  Thank you for the awesome recipe Liz!

This is a ''cool'' base recipe for our house. Always loving the extras in life, we added brown rice syrup or date sugar, instead of 'sugar'. Brown rice flour and oat flour and oat bran plus baking soda plus flaxseed chopped in the coffee grinder saves us from our wheat allergies, and we added a touch of rice milk too.  Lemon extract rather than vanilla, and blueberries, apricots, and cranberries we added for fruity taste. Gosh, I have to go eat another, lo!  (We love the brown rice syrup substitute for the sugar, which with the butter is super awesomely tasty, wooo! We love this basic recipe given, as it gives us a base to be creative and extraordinary!  Thank you all.

This was a very easy recipe, and the dough rolled out great, just allow the dough to warm up some after taking it out of the refrigerator, I found it easier to roll the warmer it was, and they were also tasty,  Just watch, because I didn't keep my eye on them the first batch and they browned a little to fast, so I watched the rest and they came out perfect, everyones ovens are different.

I made these ones a couple of nights ago for my husband and I and today are almost gone.
Buttery, creamy, light, perfect!.
They were very easy to roll and cut and actually healthier, due to all that oat flour, which is a plus, if you are trying to sneak in some oats into your loved one's diet.

This is the kind of cookie made for decorating, icing and dipping in chocolate, a delicate flavor that doesn't clash with your choice of decorating; I plan to make these ones for Christmas and pass around, along with the recipe.

The easiest dough I have ever worked with! My cookies kept there shape and did not stick to the counter top at all while I was rolling them. The final cookie is okay. It is dry and disolves in the mouth. I recommend topping with sugar prior to baking.

This is a great recipe, I just finished them up.  Word of warning, these do NOT make 60 cookies, unless they are paper thin or super tiny.  I was using them to give to kids for Valentines and they would be wrapped individually so I didn't want them to fall apart.  They made 30.

A really tasty cookie.  Made it with my three year old grand daughter and it was fun to make and easy to roll.  I have tried so very many cutout cookie recipies but I will definitely make this one again.  Don't roll them too thick as we lost some of our shapes!!

I really wanted this recipe to be great, but alas, it isn't.  I read all of the reviews here and was worried the cookies would be dry.  I added 1/4 cup milk to the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly.  The cookies look good and taste good, but they are still very dry.  I made sure not to over bake them, too.  They literally suck the saliva right out of your mouth.  You need a tall glass of milk or cup of coffee to wash these down with, but why bother when there are so many NOT dry recipes to choose from?  My kids will eat them so they won't go to waste, but I won't be making these again.

Great recipe.  I made tool shaped cookies for my son's birthday, so it was hard to move them to the cookie sheet and some of them broke (I don't bake, so it was probably me and not the recipe) but they tasted great.  They aren't too sweet, which we loved.

Awesome cookies.  The use of oat flour and confectioners sugar makes this dough incredibly easy to work with-even my five year old had no problems.  The cookies were soft and flavorful; very yummy!  I added some lemon extract to one batch with excellent results.

These were very easy to make (my 4-year-old could do it) and had good flavors.  Followed the recipe exactly and came out looking and perfect after 7 minutes.  We will definitely make them again.

5 stars for the chewy oat-like flavor with orange and lemon extract. Added wheatgerm, ground flaxseed and whole wheat flour. Came out great with only using 1/2c of all purpose flour. I halved the recipe, only half c butter available.

I'm rating this 4 stars for the great taste, but I really struggled with the dough not to mention finding oat flour in my area.  This is not a fault of the recipe however and will try again.

Made these with my nephew when he was 8.  He was able to help with all the steps and we worked together to eat most of them up during his visit.  (Although he did save a couple to take home to his mom.)  :-)

Like another reviewer, I have a family member with a gluten allergy, so I substitued a mixture of gluten-free flours (oat, rice, quinoa) for the wheat.  If you want to make cut-outs, I'd recommend refrigerating it for at least overnight, if not longer.  I let it sit for about six hours and it was still too soft to roll out.  I was in a little hurry, so I just rolled the dough into little balls and then rolled them in sugar.  They baked up very nicely and tasted wonderful!  Nobody would ever guess that they were gluten-free.

These worked perfectly! The dough was easy to work with after going in the fridge for 30 min or so. I like the taste too, the oat flour makes it much more interesting.

I made this dough today for a group of children to try.  I ground some quick oats for the oat flour, and I substituted butter-flavored shortening for the butter due to lactose intolerance.  The dough was a little dry, but the flavor of the cookies was just wonderful.  I will use this recipe again, I think I can tweak it to fix the dryness, which may have been due to the substitutions I made.

A soft cookie that holds royal icing. The oatmeal flour raises it above the traditional sugar cookie.

This recipe was fun and easy!  I think the dough rolled out easier when it was warm...and the cookies have a great taste to them.  I didn't frost mine, but I'm sure they would be great with frosting.  I'm definitely using this recipe for Christmas cookies!!

I am not sure what happened! I followed the recipe, taking care of knowing that the oat flour might make the cookie dry, but, the dough came out gooey and sticky! I chilled it for over an hour, but still gooey. I drop-measured 3 to bake and try, and it came out cakey and misshapened, couldn't even roll it to cut it! I'll try it again someday, cause the cakey cookie tasted like a good butter cookie,

Well...I twisted a lot. I used 2/3 cup of olive oil and honey in place of sugar and butter. I increased the flour by two tablespoons each because I thought it would be runny if I didn't. I left the dough over night and this morning it would stay together let alone roll. I used my hands and a fork to shapen it. Anyone with better idea to make this work?

Dry, flat sugar cookies.  Oats added a teeny bit more flavor, but dryness, too.  Put a yummy lemon glaze over, but not impressed.  Made many a sugar cookie & other doughs; this one is not as easy to work with as others mentioned.  I'd prefer a cookie dough that takes buttermilk or the like.  Dough is tastier than the baked cookie.  Don't usually leave bad reviews, but I love oats & this is not the recipe for them.
