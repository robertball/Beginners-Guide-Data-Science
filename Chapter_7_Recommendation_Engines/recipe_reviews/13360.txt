This recipe was so easy to fix great for a cold day. My husband and father-in-law ate it up leftovers and all. My kids ate it but picked the carrots out. I recommend serving it with grilled cheese sandwiches.

We made it but with 2 cans of carrots 2 cans of green beans and 4 cans of tomato sauce instead of soup. My husband also added garlic salt to the water before I added everything. It made a huge batch. It tasted really great. But if you're going to make it the way we did I would suggest 2 1/2 lbs of meat. But none the less it tastes great.

I thought this recipe was a great launching pad for tweaking. I used a can each of tomato & mushroom soup to reduce the "tomato soup-y" taste added minced garlic to the ground beef and a healty amount of thyme and used fresh green beans. I really liked it but my husband was less than impressed. I would give it 4 stars but since hubby probably doesn't want me to make it again I have to reduce it to 3. Thanks for the post and I wish I could make it again!

Edible. I needed to doctor it up quite a bit to give it any interesting flavor at all.

A great basic stew. I left out the carrots because my family hates them. I also decided to add frozen peas and Lima beans. All was well. It seems like almost anything could be added and it would taste good. I make a whole pot of this and then freeze it in containers for my husband's lunch.

Well this is really quite good! I only had 2 cans of tomato soup so I used condensed potato soup for the last can and it was awesome! I didn't use as much water so mine was a little thicker. Very easy and warming dinner!

Very simple to make. I made mine in the crock pot so it was all done when I got home from work. I thought it had a little too much of a "canned tomato soup" flavor so next time will use tomato sauce for 1 can of the soup. My son did give it 5 stars.

I added about 1 cup of red wine and it gave the stew more depth and flavor! Also added garlic powder. Mmmmm!

Fast and easy to be creative with. Added corn peas and a 1/2 cup of red wine. Only had 1 can of tomato soup so I added tomato sauce.
