This was a great alternative for us because my husband LOVES pistachio pudding but has a cream cheese allergy.
I made it just as-is then added a layer of whipped topping. It was light, not too sweet.  I loved the texture with the nuts in it but it tasted almost too nutty and drowned out that classic Pistachio Pudding taste.  I would make it again.

This is a great pie but it is also great as a pistachio salad.  Using pistachios in the place of walnuts and do not use the graham cracker crusts...just serve as a summer salad.
