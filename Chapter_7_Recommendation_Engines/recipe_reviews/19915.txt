I needed some kind of a sauce to use on my salmon burgers and ran across this recipe. It went nicely with the burgers. Like another review, I did have to use paste versus powdered wasabi.

We loved it as a dipping sauce for shrimp cocktail!  I used 1 teaspoon of wasabi paste instead of the powder.

Execellent new tartar sauce/cocktail sauce I added to my recipe file.  Severd it with a walnut crusted salmon.  The sweet/hot together woke up the taste buds.  Not a sauce to be spread on your fish and baked!  It is meant to be served as a side dipping sauce.  I tried to make it with yellow mustard once, and it wasn't as good.  It needs the Dijon mustard. Hubby and friends really enjoyed it.

I made this as directed with the wasabi powder. We used it with salmon and enjoyed it. The taste is not for the faint of heart. My husband suggested I add a little Spenda/sugar and that helped to cut the mustard taste. I would cut the mustard to one teas or not at all. Otherwise, we liked it.

I really did not like this sauce at all. My husband wanted to try something different with crabcakes other than the traditional tartar I usually make. We tasted it before hand and it was way too intense. So, he took just a teaspoon and thinned it out with more mayo and it still was too intense. It would probably be good on a burger but not seafood.

I admit, I didn't expect much, but found this sauce to be interesting and TASTY.  Easy to throw together.  Will make this one again and again, this recipe is a keeper in my kitchen!

I'm not usually one to rate things online, but this sauce was completely awful on seared tuna.  You'd be much better off just using dijon mustard.  The wasabi brought a very unappetizing bitterness to the fish.  I'd recommend that you try this in a one-person quantity first instead of the default 10.

This isn't too bad.  I used wasabi paste instead of powder so used about 1/3 of the amount called for.  I also used minced dried onion instead of green onion since I don't have any of that.  Thanks for the recipe!

We didnâ€™t love it. Might have been better with less Dijon mustard.

I don't know if I did this wrong or what.. but I did not care for it. I'm usually able to salvage anything by adding this or that but man.. I can't make this better. My Wasabi powder is about a year old.. maybe it's not good anymore.

I followed the recipe then had my family taste it. We all agreed it was missing something. I added a few table spoons of teriyaki sauce and it was great.
