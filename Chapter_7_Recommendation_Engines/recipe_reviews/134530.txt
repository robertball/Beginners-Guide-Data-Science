I wanted to add one more thing to my above review. Next time I make it, I will mix half the garlic with the tomatoes and half with the butter. It is just the right amount of garlic, but would taste better spread evenly throughout the whole thing than just concentrated in the bread.

This is a lovely recipe! So delicious and fresh. I was drawn to this recipe because of the English muffins. I love English muffins. I didn't peel the tomatoes and instead of sliced mozzarella, I used shredded. I also divided the garlic up between the butter and tomato mixtures. We had these for lunch and they came out like awesomely fresh mini-pizzas!

Inspired blend of flavors and mouthfeel: savory, sweet, bright, rich, crunchy, creamy, warm, cool. And just as drescribed, snarfed up just as it was plated. I brought the ingredients (substituting the more traditional french bread slices) to the annual holiday hoo haa to assemble there. Upon arrival I spotted at least five other platters of bruschetta of various types and I almost didn't make these out of concern about waste as the other platters were just being picked at.  I persevered and without fanfare plopped these on the groaning board. Within 5 minutes all 36 had disappeared.

This was very yummy! I sliced the tomatoes instead of peeling/chopping & just spread a little tomato paste on the bottom of each slice. The butter mixture was so yummy- next time I'm going to double that part. I baked @ 350 for 10-15 minutes instead of broiling (only because I don't have very good luck broiling). I also omitted the olives (don't care for olives). Will definitely make again! Thank you!

Simple, fresh and tasty! I liked the idea of using English muffins for this, as it made a nice twist. Thanks for sharing. :)
