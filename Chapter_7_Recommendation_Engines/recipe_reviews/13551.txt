I was looking for a bread pudding recipe that was moist and more on the custardy side.  Husband says that most bread puddings are too dry. When I made this he was very happy!  I took it to a potluck and everyone loved the recipe.  I made it twice and both times it came out deliciously.  This is a very rich recipe... the only thing I did differntly than the recipe is to increase the cinnamon by 1 tsp.  I used what is called Hawaiian Sweet Bread.  This recipe is definitely ONO and a keeper.

I made this Christmas Eve and served it with homemade whipping cream and fresh raspberries. My husband's 88 year-old grandma said it was the best bread pudding she had ever eaten. It was so simple to make. I used vanilla challa bread from a local bakery which I think really made it extra special. I used a lot more than 2 pinches of cinnamon on top for a little more flavor but other than that, followed the recipe to a tee. It was very custardy. Simply delicious. I will make again and again.

I loved the taste and texture of this bread pudding.  So creamy!  However, it needed more flavor.  I made a quick whiskey sauce and Oh Yum!  Perfect!

Fantastic recipe!!!
I made it for my work, my husbands work, and my family... everyone loved it!!! I didn't butter the bread first or mix the bread in with the mixture, I layered the bread in the pan and poured it on top. I added butter last in slivers randomly on the top after it was all put together. I added allot more cinnamon than it called for, and in one of the pans I added a can of pumpkin into the mix. The pumpkin one was a SMASH hit! Thankyou for the recipe! For my first time making bread pudding, it was a foolproof, and an easy one to do! Happy Holidays!!!!

First, many thanks to all who took the time to enter a review. It certainly was a big help to me. I made the following changes: 4 qt (10x15) glass baking dish, 1 doz extra large eggs, 19 slices of cinnamon bread, 1 cup golden raisins which I placed in a bowl of very hot water (to plump up) for 15 mins, 3 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 cup of sugar. I let the bread soak up the egg/vanilla mixture for 15 mins before I added the other ingredients. Didn't need the cinnamon or nutmeg and didn't butter/toast the bread beforehand. Baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 20 mins. Very, very tasty!

This recipe came out very good but I kinda goofed through it.  Mine was very thick & custardy with a nice crusty top even though after I realized I skipped the 'toast bread' step.  Mine was already a couple of days old and nice and firm which helped to spread the butter and not smoosh the bread.  I had to use about 3 cups heavy whipping cream and 2 cups half&half as that is what I had on hand.  It wasn't grainy at all even without a water bath which I really liked.  I also accidently dumped quite a bit of cinnamon after the shaker top fell off (oopsie!) but if this hadn't happened I think it may have been too bland.  I will make this again with the same 'adjustments'.  Yummy!

This is excellent!  I took a shortcut and buttered only one side of the toast, but it turned out to be fantastic anyway.  I also topped it with a vanilla sauce I found on another recipe website, and it made this recipe beyond belief.  In case you're wondering, the vanilla sauce I used was:  1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of whipping cream.  Cook over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and add 1 tsp of vanilla.  Wonderful!

This was the best bread pudding I've ever tasted. Many recipes come out thick and dry but this one was custardy as promised. My family loved it! I did use a bit more than a "pinch" of each spice but otherwise this recipe is flawless.

I made this today for thanksgiving and it was a dud. I thought it needed alot more than a pinch of cinnamon and it wasn't very tastey. Maybe more cinnamon and sugar.

This recipe is very yummy! Things I did differently: I did not butter the bread first. I broke the bread in small pieces into a large bowl, then took a stick of room temperature butter and sliced it into 12 small pieces. I took 3 pieces(of butter) at a time with the bread and then mixed the bread with a mixer. I did this altertnatingly till all pieces of butter were gone. Then I got in it with my hands and mixed it a bit more. I did ad another 1/2 stick butter to it. I did not use regular bread. I used 2 packs of the Hawaiian sweet rolls. For the cinnamon and nutmeg, I sprinkled cinnamon all over the top, then with a wooden spoon, I swirled it into the batter so that some would get into the batter and some would stay on top. I did the same with the nutmeg. In a pinch, I ran out of vanilla extract, so I used pancake syrup in its place. The recipe came out yummalicious!

I thought that this recipe was way to sweet. It also was very eggy. It also needed more cinnamon.

Perfect! Lends itself wonderfully to additions. I used a baguette and added dried cranberries and little apple pieces, then  made a carmel sauce to serve with - outstanding. This should be the base for all bread puddings, if not wonderful on it's own.

Don't change a thing as it's perfect as written!
Now if you want to add items to spice it up like cranberries, chocolate chips, nuts etc then add but keep the basic recipe the same. You won't be disappointed...Yummy, Custardy Bread Pudding

Very rich with a good flavor, but kind of messy to make and not as custardy as I prefer.  Overall very good tho! Try it!

The best thing i like about this pudding is that it has texture!! sooo many bread puddings look so thick and one layered that i can't bring myself to eat it. I made enough for 2 batches. i used 2 very large glass pie plates that i purchased from IKEA for $4.99. I used 1 loaf of handbraded Challah bread and half a loaf of cinn-raisin bread (i know this was over 1 pound) i put extra cinn and nutmeg, added a little clove. It came out great i took them to 2 different homes for Thanksgiving and i got 6 phone calls about it. I just got through making2 more this morning for other people (one for my friend who will swap a pan of her famous mac&cheese for the bread pudding).  This time i used 1 1/2 Challah bread, i chopped 2 apples and in a pot on the stove i added 1/2 cup raisins, 1/4 cup of dried craisins, vanilla and 1 cup sugar of the 3 cups called for and brought it to a boil just enough for the apples to get soft and added it to the mix. It came out great!!!! i have 3 more to make before the week is out "OMG". I will try adding mashed pumpkin , sweet potato, sliced almonds, amaretto, rum, flavored liquors, peaches...... the list can go on and on of what i can do (not all together of course). Thank u so much this is the "Bomb". I will pass this recipe on to all. I am so impressed that it looks just like the picture that is soo important to me when i am looking for recipes.

My family loves this! It is true comfort food. I halve the recipe and use less sugar (4 Tbsps butter, 8 slices bread, 6 eggs, 1-1/2 Tbsp vanilla, 2-1/2 cups half-n-half and 3/4 cup sugar).  I sprinkle with cinnamon and bake it in a 9 by 9 inch baking dish for 40 to 45 minutes and serve with whipped cream and fresh berries.

This recipe calls for way too much sugar and vanilla. After only three bites I couldn't stand anymore of it's sickly sweet taste. If I were to ever make it again I would reduce the sugar and vanilla by half. However, having a 9x13 pan of uneatable bread pudding did give me a great idea. I chopped up half of this bread pudding, put it in an 8x11 pan, and poured my own basic custard recipe (minus the sugar) over it. I also added more cinnamon and nutmeg. I baked this new concoction for 1hour 15minutes at 350degrees. It turned out perfect! It was everything I was hoping the first recipe would've been; the perfect amount of sweetness with just a hint of vanilla. I'm freezing the other half of the too sweet bread pudding so I can make my version again some day.

This recipe is very delish, thank you, Joey.  I have made several batches of this bread pudding and mixed it up a bit....by adding dried fruits; such as: cranberries and walnuts, cherries and almonds, and raisens and pecans.  Then I made different sauces like; vanilla, maple, and almond. It's always a hit with family and friends

Made this for a 3rd time and really liked the way it came out this time.  What I did different was trim the crust off, bake in a bain marie, and covered the top with tinfoil for the first half of cooking then uncovered for last half for top to brown.  I like it that way and it appears the folks who it was made for did too.  I added a full tsp to tsp and half of pumpkin spice.  One of the people text me then next morning asking for another piece.  Dang, now I want another piece...

This recipe turned out good in spite of me having to substitute milk for half and half and soft wheat bread for white bread.  I have never liked or wanted bread pudding until I recently traveled to Jamaica (where I received it accidentally for dessert my first night there.)  Since then I have craved it but have been unable to find a recipe without raisins and such.  This one is very close.  I will make it again.  I cut back a little on the sugar and I also made a rum sauce for my husband to use on the side.  It was very good with and without the rum sauce.  I am sure it will be even better when I use half and half the next time.  Also, this recipe makes alot.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.

I used this recipe as a base for a "Cinnamon Bread" bread pudding. I used a local bakeries yeast cinnamon bread (yeast, you know, with that nice rolled cinnamon swirl). I made a half-batch and baked in an 8x8 pan.

For the half batch, I just weighed the cinnamon bread to be 1/2 pound, toasted, buttered lightly, and tore it apart in 1" cubes. For the half recipe, I used less sugar than called for b/c this was meant for a brunch, not dessert, further the bread was already sweet. I just used 3/4 cup of white sugar. I did not add any extra cinnamon, but added about 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg to the milk to dissolve.

Of importance! Be sure you let the bread soak in the egg/vanilla mix for about 5 minutes, then add the sugared-milk.  This lets the egg set into the bread a bit.

I used whole milk instead of half and half, and even then I thought it too much fat.

I baked at 350d for 60 minutes, just when the center read a temp at 160d (important, since I had a mother-to-be at the brunch...I could assure her the eggs were thoroughly cooked).

I chilled it the night before and by the time it was served, it was room temp and scrumptious!

It is an egg-y custardy slice-able bread pudding...just the way I like it!

I divided this recipe in half and used 2 8"x8" pans.  I used half white and half whole wheat bread.  I think that buttering each slice on both sides gives a very savory flavor although it is time consuming.  I used kitchen shears to cut up the bread.  I added 3/4 c raisins to 1 batch and 3/4 c blueberries soaked in vodka (They were strained from homemade blueberry cordial) to the other.  They were both delicious.

This was a very good recipe. It made a lot. I used some stale sourdough bread. I did the recipe just as, except I boiled the raisins for about 10 minutes in water, vanilla, and cinnamon. My husbad loved it, too. The only change I would like, is it be a little more syrup-y (is that a word? lol). Thanks for posting!

I have made this atleast 3 times cause it's a major hit with my friends. I can't bring myself to put in 12 eggs so I always put in 8. I also don't like the overly potent smell of vanilla so I only add about 2 tablespoons. I put extra extra cinnamon and extra nutmeg on top. Very wonderful recipe, I love it and make it every time we have family come in or an event to go to.

The recipe was easy to follow, and the result delightfully castardy. Like the previous reviewers, I added more nutmeg and cinnamon. I'm going to try it again next time with vanilla sauce!

Needs more cinnamon but otherwise is really good. A sauce to serve on top wouldn't hurt either. Eating it hot with vanilla ice cream on the side would take it over the top!

This recipe is  PERFECTION  just the way it is.  But,  I  have  made  it  several  times,  and  have  to  admit  that  I  don't  toast the bread,  and  a  couple  of  times  I  used  raisins.

This was too sweet! I love sweets as much as anyone but this was too much. I questioned the amount of sugar but the reviews were so positive I went ahead with the full amount. I may try again but will try 2/3 the amount. I also could not stand the idea of so much fat with all the butter and then the half and half. I didn't butter the bread and used whole milk instead of milk and think that works fine. I also added a lot more cinnamon as others suggested. I stirred in about 2 tsps. to the eggs.

I like my bread oudding to be a bit custardy (is that a word?) and this is the one.  We skipped the toasting/buttering the bread part, but used a french miche loaf.  (about 1 pound)  The first time we made it, we couldn't fit it all in the pan, so we saved a little egg mixture.  When it was about 30 minutes from done, I poured the last of the eggs on top (about 1-1/2 cups), let it sit for 15 minutes and finished baking.  It was awesome.  The second time, we let the bread soak for much longer (45 minutes to an hour) before baking and it was less custardy, but more moist on top.  The cinnamon and nutmeg for the top is more like a couple of teaspoons than a couple of dashes, but then I'm a cinnamon freak.  Instead of regular birthday cake, I had my wife make this!!!

So good.  I used french bread, and divided the recipe into two dishes, leaving one as-is, and adding dried cranberries and white chocolate chunks to the second - SO GOOD!  Made and excellent Christmas dessert!  I'll be using this one again.

This was my first attempt at bread pudding, but it was so easy to make.  My only problem was that I read other reviews and added more cinnamon - which turned out to be too much for me.  I'll make this again for sure, next time sticking to the original recipe.

Really good recipe Geoff.  I didn't have 5 cups of half and half so I used part milk and eggnog and left out the spices.  This made a huge batch and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  Thanks again.

My husband loves bread pudding so I decided to give this recipe a try. I did tweak the recipe a little by using half and half cream in place of the milk. I also used two cups of sugar instead of three and added a pinch of pumpkin spice and nutmeg. The result was a delicious bread pudding that was a big hit with my family, especially my husband. Will hold onto this one.

This recipe was delicious! I was looking for a bread pudding that was thick and custardy, and this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. After reading the reviews, I decided that I would put 2 1/2 C of sugar instead of 3, and also added 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of a pinch. Fabuloso!!

Having to please an "Authentic Cajun Family" this recipe hits the spot. I make this for our annual Mardi-Gras Party every year. I did make additions to the recipe as it was a little boring. I add 1/2 cup of shredded coconut,1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1/2 cup golden raisins. I usually have to add a little more liquid to compensate for the dry additions. 
I serve this with a butter-rum sauce on the side. PERFECT!!!

This recipe was a HIT at two potlucks I attended recently.  I had never made a bread pudding before, and it was so easy and failproof.  Easy to make and adapts well to modifications (I used Splenda for Baking Blend instead of white sugar and Fat Free Half and Half).  Overwhelming raves from everyone; thank you so much for sharing this super tasty, awesome recipe!!  Truly ono-licious!!

This was a very delicious dessert we served at our family Christmas this year.  Everyone loved it!  We will definitely be making this a holiday tradition.  It was very easy and made a huge batch.  I actually had to use two dishes to bake it in because the large one was not large enough.  I will be trying different variations as well and I'm sure they'll be excellent.
