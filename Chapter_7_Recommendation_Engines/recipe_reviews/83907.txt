I make a recipe very similar to this, but different enough to ask readers to consider:  use a bit more bacon grease to cook the onions; aggresively season the potatoes, and fry them until they are lightly browned; leave out the oregano, add a pinch of nutmeg, use a good amount of white pepper or cayenne pepper to give it some snap, add 3/4 cup of sour cream out the end, and heat through.  Leave out the cheeses!  Diced carrots can be added with the onion, and frozen peas can be added with the corn, for variety.  Hope you enjoy!

After I cooked the bacon to a crisp, I took it out of the skillet and all but 2-3 tablespoons of the drippings and sauteed the onion and a little fresh minced garlic in the drippings until the onion turned translucent. I added the bacon, sauteed onion/garlic, potatoes, chicken broth, spices, and the corn to my crockpot and cooked them on LOW for most of the day. Once I got home, I turned the heat down on my crockpot and lightly smushed the potatoes with my old fashioned potato masher, then added the cream and the cheeses. The soup was okay but it didn't have nearly enough bacon, cheese or spices. After tasting it, I did throw in more monterey jack/cheddar cheese and a few more spices. Not a bad soup that worked out well for me in the crockpot. I don't know that I would make this soup again.

I guess I should have read the reviews first and I would have added less stock and another can of creamed corn.  For me, this was too thin to be called a chowder.  I got a tip from a co-worker though, that will be good on the leftovers...add instant mashed potatoes until the desired consistency is achieved.  I think that will help.  Overall good flavor though.  Will probably make again with the noted changes.

This was a yummy cream soup.  It's not quite thick enough to be a chowder but still delicious.  I used Swanson Seasoned Chicken Broth since that was what I had on hand and it added a lot of flavor.  I forgot to buy an onion so that was omitted.  Next time I will try to remember to thicken it up a bit with some flour.  Definitely a perfect supper for chilly winter weather.

I made a few changes and this recipe was wonderful! Based on previous reviews, I added about 5 cloves of garlic in with the onions, a little extra bacon, 1/2 teaspoon of paprika and only used 4 cups chicken stock. I also added 1/2 cup of 2% milk. It came out Delicous!

We enjoyed this soup.  I cook the bacon and remove it - use it for the garnish as we like it crisp.  You can add more potatoes and kind of mash them.  I did add celery & carrots and used fresh thyme instead of the oregano.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe.

This recipe was GREAT!!  I did, however, add about 1 tbsp. flour to the onions before adding the potatoes; this gave it a thicker consistency.  I also used the larger can of whole kernel can as I did not have the 10 oz. can.  My husband, who is very picky, raved about it.  Make a double batch, as it goes quickly!!!

We added smoked sausage to this recipe.  It makes a LOT!  It was really good and we have made this numerous times on a cold day.

Delicious! just a hint - I put the bacon & onion together first, added the potatoes, stock and seasonings. Once potatoes cooked, blend with hand-blender for thick and creamy soup - then add your corns. I don't know what Jack cheese is, so used Gouda and Tasty. Definately make again! Also, I strained it and gave it to my 15month old and she loved it too!

While my boyfriend raved about this soup, I'd have to say it was just o.k.  I used larger cans of corn, as I couldn't find the size specified.  I also used some flour/water paste before adding the cream to help thicken it up as someone else mentioned - It was quite brothy.  The result was somewhat bland - maybe next time I'll try adding some thyme or a bay leaf to give it some flavor.

Outstanding recipe.  This was fast and easy, had great taste.  Next time I am going to add crab and may mash some of the potatoes to make it a tad thicker-overall I thought it was really good.  My family loved it!

I'm not a great cook and not in the best of moods but I had a heck of a time with this recipe. I think I've spent close to 2 hours on it with prep included.  I had my gas stove set to medium high heat but those potato cubes were not browning, finally cranked it up to high to get them going.  Then the simmering...I have simmered before but again, wasn't happening on anything lower than medium so after the first 15 minutes raised the heat.  Finally some action but those darned potatoes were not getting soft so I think we ended up with 45 minutes of cook time before I added the corn, then cooked for another 20 minutes or so (I've lost track) and most of the potatoes were cooked through.  Added the heavy cream and cheese, mixed and...bland.  I think maybe salt and pepper to taste should be a little more specific, I think of a pinch and a dash but so far I've added at least 1/4 tsp of each. I only used 3 cups of chicken broth and 2 large baking potatoes so the consistency was great. I did not add the flour as others suggested but I do have good consistency. 
This was EXCELLENT the following day reheated in the microwave, the flavors definitely melded overnight so I have upgraded my rating.

This was very good- despite other suggestions, the only changes I made were to add double the amount of cream corn- and it was plenty thick enough. Very very good, but I will still add more corn next time- it was almost a potato chowder with some corn in it. All in all, we loved it!

This was wonderful.  The soup was more brothy then thick, but alittle flour will take care of that.  But the flavor was super and sooo easy. Thanks for a wonderful dish.

Ok, so I used my bacon yesterday for BLT's and didn't have any for this BUT I did have some bacon grease to saute the onions and garlic ( my addition)and potatoes in. I didn't brown the potatoes, 'cus time was a factor, and only added 3 cups of a flavorful , so many arn't, chicken broth. I couldn't get my eye on the oreagano and so used basil and had no cream so added what we drink - 1% milk. I added alittle more cheese than called for.    We like it alittle thicker so I just mashed up some of the potatoes and stirred it up - GREAT!  This is the best recipe to work from - thank you.

It was okay.  Everyone ate it without complaining, but it lacked the flavor we like.  In spite of all the other ingredients (potatoes, cheese, onions, etc.) it kept too much of the "canned" taste of the corn -- you know, that flavor canned corn has that fresh or frozen doesn't.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised since it does have 2 cans worth in it.  :-)  I think it needed something to balance out that flavor.  On the other hand, if you love canned corn, you will probably love this.  It looked really scrumptious while cooking.

I picked this recipe because I didn't have evaporated or condensed milk on hand.  This recipe is so fast & east & tasty!  I only used 4 cups of broth because that's all I had on hand.  But I found it to be a little watery & not quite as thick and creamy as I'd like but the taste was out of this world.  I'm making it again this week but I might throw in a little flour to thicken it up a bit.  Great cold weather meal!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to use pre-packaged shreaded potatoes due to time.  It turned out really good.  I also used turkey bacon and added polish sausage to make it a meal.  I loved the taste and texture.  it was pretty thick and yummy.  I also topped it with a dollop of sour cream and that was a perfect touch.  Not very waiste line friendly but yummy.

This is a good base recipe. I switched things up.. I used all of the bacon drippings (about 3 tbls.) to cook the onions. I then added the potatoes that I seasoned with sea salt and pepper to the mix. I nixed the oregano and instead added cayenne pepper, white pepper and nutmeg. I mashed the potatoes with a stick blender..I used nothing but frozen corn, and replaced the cheeses with sour cream. I gave my husband the option of the bacon as a garnish or cooking it in the chowder. He chose garnish..It was wonderful the first night and even better the next day.

I thought this was a great recipe and wonderful flavor, as is.  It was not thick, but thick enough, as the thick soups often have thickeners, which are nothing more than added calories and preservatives.  I did not add a whole onion, and it was just enough.  The flavor the next day was delicious, you could taste the corn, the potatoes, the bacon, all individual tastes. I do cook soups often and it only took me under an hour and it was a hit.

I didn't fry the potatoes but boiled them in the broth until they were soft.  I sauteed onions, celery and carrots in the bacon grease, then put in the broth as well as the following seasonings: Cavender's Greek Seasoning, Bay Leaves and Thyme.  Used some Smoked Cheddar and Smoked Swiss besides the one's listed in the recipe.  I didn't like the consistency that it was and added some instant garlic roasted mashed potatoes. Garnished with bacon crumbles and chopped chives. So basically, I completely changed the recipe. I thought it was pretty good then.

I too changed this recipe around, but what a tasty starter recipe! I combined it with another recipe from here by adding Sherry, red & green peppers, cayenne & parsley from 'Corn Chowder II'. Then, per our personal tastes, I added some thyme, cumin, garlic, carrots & celery. I added the garlic & onion with the potatoes to cook (about 7/8 minutes) in the bacon grease . Once I added the broth, it only took 15 minutes to soften them. I doubled this recipe as well, so we-d have lots of left-overs. As others have mentioned, it is thin as-is...so I added a 3rd can of cream corn...next time I might try adding more heavy cream. Overall, this was a huge hit. We loved it! Thank you to the authors of both this recipe and Corn Chowder II! It will definately be a regular in our kitchen.

This recipe is easy and I had everything on hand.  I did not deviate from the recipe.  It was so yummy that my husband was making happy noises as he ate it.  Thanks for sharing.

Great soup, instantly became my daughter’s favorite!
I made the soup a bit ticker, that way it was more filling, a full meal just by itself. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made it exactly as per the recipe and loved it!  It's lighter than a traditional chowder, but I prefer this consistency as it's not heavy.  Delicious!

Very flavorful.  I used sweet onion and added a sweet sausage (steamed separately and not Italian) for a hearty take.  It paired great with the bacon.  I used exact measurements for corn and it was just fine.  Did use corn labeled "sweet" though.    Did not peel the potatoes and used a combination of colored fingerlings.  They are generally soft and quicker to cook.  10 and 12-year old ate it up.   Served with cornbread made in muffin tins.
