Not bad!  GREAT way to use up extra peppers from the garden.  I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda and about 3/4 cup vegetable oil and 1 1/4 cup olive oil.  Threw in about 10 cloves of garlic instead of 6 just because.  Once the marinade was done, I threw the sliced peppers into the pot, covered it, and let it cool down.  I don't like raw peppers, so that way they got cooked just so that they were soft, but not mushy.  There was a lot of extra marinade, but it serves as a good salad dressing.

I reduced this recipe down to using only 2 red peppers.  It came out beautifully!  I love the taste of these peppers, and will be sure to make them again very soon!

This is a great recipe I return to time after time. I omit the anchovies (a personal preference) and reduce the amount of oil and sugar slightly (for dietary reasons) but this is a good standard marinated vegetable recipe you can use with other veggies as well.

Nice.  I tossed in more garlic and scaled it back to use just one pepper.  I didn't have red peppers but used 1/2 a yellow pepper and a small orange pepper.  I added a bit more garlic to the mix.  Still turned out lovely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Soooooooooo easy - I too omitted the anchovies.  Can't wait to use this during the summer when peppers are so plentiful!!!

This made a nice compliment to my 'non-relish' relish tray this Christmas.

Made this today  because I had a lot of red peppers.
It turned out great and the whole family loves it. To my amazement they ate almost the whole jar.
