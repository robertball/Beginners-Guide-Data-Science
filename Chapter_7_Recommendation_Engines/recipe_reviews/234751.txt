Loved these muffins for breakfast this fall morning! I had only whole almonds so I chopped them up to put on top. I also omitted the sprinkling of powdered sugar at the end. Delicious way to start my day.

I only had stone milled whole wheat flour at home which gave a healthy taste to the muffins. perhaps because of that it also took 20 min to bake. I totally omitted white sugar, leaving only 1/4 cup brown sugar and adding a cup of unsweetened peaches that I had in the freeze. It was just the right amount of sweet and VERY moist -i had sprayed my silicone cups. .not necessary.  next time I'll try to add 1/2 cup of oil only.  Tastes healthy and delicious!  made 12 muffins and two very  small loaves
