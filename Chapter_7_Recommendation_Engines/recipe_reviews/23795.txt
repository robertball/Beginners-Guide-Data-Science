I don't know if MDK got the preportions on this wrong or just likes really sweet dressings.  I only added about 1/2 cup of sugar, but it was so sweet.  I tried adding about a 1/4 cup of oil, some garlic and Italian seasoning to cut down on the sweetness, but it didn't work.  If I were to make this again I would cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and keep the rest the same.  I used to top pasta salad, so the sweetness wasn't too over powering, but I won't according to the directions again.

I only put a little salad in a bowl just to try this dressing that I made 4 days ago.  I'm sure glad I did because this dressing is just awful.  I only used 1/4 cup sugar and it still is very sweet.  It is so runny that it won't stay on the lettuce and it just puddles in the middle of the bowl.  I thought what an easy, fat free dressing, but definitely not for us.

I agree with the other reviewer that it was too sugary. But other than that, it had a great flavor, good aftertaste and I will make it again using half of the sugar. Thanks!

My husband loved this and my kid's like it also.  Very good after it sits in refrigerator overnight!
