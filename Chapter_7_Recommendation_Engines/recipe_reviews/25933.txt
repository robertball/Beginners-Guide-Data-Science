Wooo hooo a clone of the chicken tenderloins from Cracker Barrell!!!! These were very good! I think I will marinate them more than 2 hrs like I did...in fact I'll probably let them soak overnight for maximum flavor. Also next time I wont use oil to pan fry them.... there is pleanty of oil in the itailan dressing to make it cook well. Thanks Chris for posting this recipe...it's a definate keeper!!!

Absolutely delicious.  I made this for dinner with rice and a zucchini corn sidedish.  My husband requested that I write this recipe down so we can have it again.  I marinated chicken for longer and cooked it with some of the marinade.  Fabulous!

We loved this recipe!  Wonderful savory and sweet flavor.  I strained the dressing and increased the honey a good bit to be more kid friendly.  Didn't have lime juice so I substituted lemon juice.  Marinated chicken tenders for a couple hours in a ziplock bag.  Added a sprinkle of salt while cooking.  Started out with a few tenders on my George Foreman grill but that was a mess to try to clean up so I sauteed the rest in a non-stick skillet, covered much of the time and near the end I added some marinade to the skillet and let it caramalize....that added a beautiful color and flavor to them!!!!  My kids and husband loved them.  Would also make a great sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is outstanding. This recipe makes one appear to be a superstar gourmet cook. I always like to keep a recipe of this on hand, frozen, for last minute dinners. I defrost, throw this on a bed of rice and with a salad I have a quick dinner in no time!

I am not a huge chicken fan, but this recipe is really good.  We marinated our chicken over night and cooked them on the grill - they stuck to the grill a little bit.  I would recommend slicing the chicken breast into fairly small pieces to get the maximum flavor out of the marinade.

There is a lesson to be learned with this recipe: often times, the simplest concoctions are the best. I have made this many times and everyone always raves about it.

I don't change a thing, except marinating it overnight, simply for convenience. It literally takes 5 minutes to prepare. It is good grilled, or simply fried up. I've even tossed the cooked chicken into a salad. Quite splendid.

This recipe is really nothing to rave about.  I was expecting something really good since it is supposed to be comparable to a restaurant.  It wasn't bad I just wasn't impressed.  Amy's Egg Garlic chicken off this site is way better!

These turned out really good.  I put them in flatbread and added lettuce, tomato, cheese and a little more italian dressing and ate them like a soft taco!  The kids loved them this way.

These were just OK for me. I did not marinate them overnight...maybe that's why mine weren't as tasty as other reviewers. Edited to add....I served the leftovers a couple days later, cold on top of a salad (Tangy Pear & Blue Cheese salad from this site) & they were much better cold on a salad than they were warm. They were juicy & flavorful....will make again just to use on salads.

I DID NOT THINK THESE TASTED LIKE RESTAURANT-STYLE CHICKEN TENDERLOINS, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THEY WERE VERY TASTY. I MARINATED THEM OVERNIGHT AND COOKED THEM ON MY GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL. VERY QUICK AND EASY.

This is a very nice marinade. Good citrus flavor and the honey really clings it to the chicken. I don't often like to eat just a piece of chicken but I can definitely handle these tenders.

Marinated chicken breasts for a couple of days, cut in to strips just before pan-frying.  Quite tasty - the addition of lime and honey elevate the flavors.

These were really yummy, I used bamboo sticks and cooked in the oven, instead of frying, much less fat that way, will make again for sure!

These were excellent!  I added a bit more lime juice to the marinade.  I only marinated for about 1 1/2 hours.  I then sauteed them, first putting them in a hot skillet to brown on the outside and then turning the temp down.  Once the chicken was cooked, I added the remaining marinade and allowed it to reduce.  The chicken was moist and juicy with an excellent flavor.  I will definitely be making these again.

I've made this before and my family loved it.  If you want to cook it on the grill, make sure to line the rack with foil.  Also, you can add a pinch of ginger root and a pinch of white pepper to give it a little more omph.

Not an exciting dish, but it was easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  It did make a big mess in my pan as the sugars carmelized.

I used chicken tenderloins, poked them all over with a fork, and used lemon juice instead of lime. These were FABULOUS! I try not to stray from original recipies, but gave this one a try with what I had on hand--I'm sure glad I did. A new favorite ! Thanks for a great recipe!

These are sooooo good.  Never had anything like this at a restaurant before, but it's mighty tasty.  Since it's hot out we grilled them.  Hubby had the cold (he was working late) and he expected to hate it, but loved it and finished all the leftovers.  Definitely making this again.  And I used an italian dressing from this site since I did have any on hand.

These turned out great!  I followed some other advice and let them marinate overnight.  The advice of straining the Italian dressing was a great one. These were great grilled, cut into pieces and placed over a salad.  Just like Cracker Barrel's grilled chicken salad. Yum!

I as well as my family was disappointed with this recipe. I added extra honey thinking the kids would taste the sweetness, however, the Italian dressing flavor was overpowering.  I wouldn't spend the money on the ingredients to make this.

This was really, really tasty!  My family loved it!  I did strain the salad dressing and I added a bit more lime and honey as suggested.  We also had to drain the frying pan a few times b/c of the juices from the chicken and like someone else towards the end of the meal I added more marinade for it to carmalize.... mmm.. very tasty : )  No leftovers with 2lbs of chicken and feeding 4ppl. Will be making this again real soon!

Restaurant Style Chicken Tenderloins' Haiku: "Not remarkable. Not bad, just wasn't awesome. (And, what restaurant?) If these were a clone of a restaurant's chicken, then I'm embarassed for that restaurants, as this wasn't the most memorable (or attractive) chicken. I marinated mine for longer than an hour, and ate it over a tossed salad w/ additional Italian dressing, mixed veggies, and feta, but the chicken didn't really bring any "wow" to my tastebuds.

I wish I had grilled these instead of baking.  They would have browned up nicely on the grill.  They were quite pale coming out of the oven.

Very good recipe.  Better flavor if left in marinade overnight than only 1 hr.

Pretty good. I used a little more honey. Chicken was nice and tender. I would make this again.

What a wonderful easy meal!  I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting the chicken in small pieces before marinating. I cooked them in a cast iron skillet sprayed with organic Pam and they came out fabulous.  My one year old and three year old gobbled it up. It's amazing how the little bit of honey and lime juice really make this marinade pop.

These turned out nice and tender.  I marinated them for 10 hours or so.  I am curious as to how to add bread crumbs or something to be more restaurant-style.

This was so easy and so tasty. I used creamy-style Italian dressing and took another reviewers advice and skipped adding oil to the pan to cook the chicken. I kept some of the marinade to add to the pan when it started to burn off. Overall a very good, quick recipe. Served it with white rice and carrots. Simple and good.

I liked these a lot. Never would have thought they would have turned out so tasty. I used a fat free garlic Italian dressing and cooked the chicken in the marinade and used it as a sauce. First night I had this in pita bread, the next night I had this over whole wheat couscous and some stir fried zucchini. Easy tasty meal. Ill make this again.

Yes, this tasted exactly like my favorite restarant's chicken tenders!  Just be real stingy on the oil when pan frying.  I used a nonstick pan and the results were great.  My kids loved it also :0)  A definite menu mainstay that I'll impress my relatives with!

I marinated the chicken for an hour with Wishbone Balsamic and Basil Vinaigerette Dressing and lemon juice and it was quite moist and tasty.  Definitely will use this recipe again.  Thanks!

I let this marinate overnight and cooked it in the pan on the stove. The flavor wasn't as strong as I hoped (marinating for two days would have been better) and I thought the flavor was not quite right. Maybe because I used an Italian dressing from a health food store? My son did not like it at all. I probably won't make this exact recipe again, will try it with a different sauce.

Loved this recipe - it was so fast and easy and it turned out great.  It will definitely be a go-to recipe for a mid-week meal.  I cooked it on the Forman grill and served it with seasoned basmati rice and peas.  Yummy!

This was ok. I grilled them on the George Forman, and boiled the leftover marinade and poured over them. It made the chicken moister. Next time, I will marinade overnight and maybe cook in the oven. Tasty, but you can't beat Cracker Barrel's.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it's definitely a 5 star dish, but I have to rate this 4 stars because it says to discard the extra marinade. DON'T THROW OUT THE EXTRA MARINADE! Throw the marinated chicken and all the marinade in the skillet, it looks like a lot of liquid, but it cooks down and caramelizes(about 30 minutes). The result is really flavorful, juicy chicken! I had a pound and a half of chicken, so I upped the zesty Italian dressing to 3/4 cup. I didn't measure the lime juice or honey, but I probably used close to 2 tablespoons(maybe?) of each, which is just a personal preference. I served it with stove-top stuffing, lima beans and biscuits with honey butter...tasty, fast meal! I made an extra 1/2 pound of the chicken, just so I would have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, plan to put it on top of a salad, which I'm sure will be fabulous! I have to say this tastes WAY better than Cracker Barrel's grilled chicken tenderloins...and costs a whole lot less! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

the chicken was gone in less than 10 minutes. my boyfriend loved it!! definitely did add a dash of salt while cooking and first chopped up some onions, caramelized them then added the chicken with the marinade and sauteed it all for 15 minutes. it was amazing, just add a little bit of water after the first ten minutes because it might burn.

Didn't have a whole lot of taste.  They were very tender, but my family really had no idea that I had marinated them in anything versus baked some plain chicken strips.

These were just ok as is. A little bland. If I make them again I will probably add some seasoning to make them more flavorful. I even let them sit overnight and then froze and thawed them in the marinade...

I made this last week and my family liked them very much.  I did marinate them overnight though and I used chicken tenderloins.  I made chicken salad out of the leftovers from a recipe that I just got from my Simple & Delicious magazine.  I added mayo, chopped cashews, chopped apple, chopped cucumber and seasonings.  It turned out great!!

These were good.  And VERY easy!  I liked that it was a marinade, but then didn't require using a grill.  The restaurant-style part threw me though.  I was wondering what type of restaurant served this, unless it was like on a caesar salad or something.  Usually chicken strips from a restaurant are fried.  I served ours over buttered noodles.
very good though, I will make again.  Thanks Chris.

Not bad, just not a repeat item here in our house.  Everyone ate the chicken, but without comment (unusual).  Could be a great springboard recipe, I'll have to bounce it around....thank you for something different!

I followed the directions exactly, and received rave reviews from the fam. Next time, I won't slice the chicken so thin; it got a bit dry while I waited for the sugars to carmelize. Other then that, great recipe :)

Chicken was tender but not very flavorful.  I've never had Cracker Barrel's version, but this was a little too bland for my taste.  I did try the baked version so maybe the pan fried version is better.

This chicken was very good, I followed recipe exactly (except for using spray oil in a non-stick skillet).  I cut up chicken breast into smaller pieces, to marinade the chicken better and so it would fry up in 15 minutes. Very tender and moist.

This was great! I thought it would be bland, but no way! This was really good.  The best tasting parts were the parts that were carmalized in the pan, so cook them until they brown nice and good!

I made this last night, and my husband ate every last one.  It has a great flavor.  I did add more honey and lime, probably about double what it calls for, and I used a champaigne salad dressing which was close to an Italian, as it is all I had.  Thanks for a great recipe I will make this again for sure.

This was just okay for me. Seemed like so much italian dressing so I added more honey. I cooked them on the G.F. grill along with some rice and carrots and peas. Not sure if I will make it again.

Delicious!! I loved it but my true barometer is when my kids ages3-6yrs all scarf it down! I made 2# of chicken worth and chopped the leftovers up for chicken salad sandwiches- equally delish!

I didn't have lime juice but I added some pesto and some Cajun seasoning into the marinade and cooked with basil flavored olive oil! Yum

Marinate in a zip lok bag, so much easier.   I've used this "recipe" for 30 years on the sailboat and camping.  But generally we use boneless chicken breast, marinate at least overnight, and grill.  Absolutely fool proof.

Oh my, this recipe is a keeper!  I doubled the recipe for our family of 7 and they loved it and would have happily eaten more.  Incredible flavor!  We will have this again soon.

I made this exactly as the recipe says except I didn't have lime juice so used lemon. I used homemade Italian dressing from this site and this came out wonderfully. My husband raved about it and wants it as a regular dish. It was very tasty and nice and moist on the inside.

My bf and I are trying to eat healthier and we've been trying to find healthy chicken recipes to make and this what he requests for work! I make these with 1 1/2 cup veggies thank you for the recipe the only change we made was the fact I didn't have limes I used lemon juice and also that I baked them

These were so flavorful and moist.  Used lemon juice instead of lime juice.  My son loved it.

Taste pretty good, but was kinda dry. I used Balsamic Vinaigrette instead though.
