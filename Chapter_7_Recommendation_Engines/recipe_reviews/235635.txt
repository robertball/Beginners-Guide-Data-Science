Made this recipe as directed, without substitutions.  I served it over basmati rice.  For a week night dinner, it's a good choice -- easy and quick, and made with ingredients that are usually on hand.  The basic ingredients are good, but it needs more flavor.  Perhaps adding some chicken-friendly herbs or taking it Italian with oregano.  You might also increase the amount of garlic.

Good. Use a head of chopped cauliflower- add at end and cook through. Added extra onion and celery...although the celery wasn't delicious...used chicken stock in place of wine.
