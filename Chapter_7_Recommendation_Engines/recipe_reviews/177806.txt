I've been making this exact recipe for about 15 years, from my Campbell's Cookbook, and the kids and I just love it!  It's not very spicy, you could kick it up a little if you like that (I've added salsa, comes out great), but we enjoy it as-is and it's been a long time favorite.  We put more sour cream on it once its on our plates, yum!

Creamy goodness! I like to make this recipe with shredded chicken cooked into Adobo and other spices, such as hot paprika, to give it more zing. After making the wrap I place it on a very hot saucepan and sear the tortilla on all sides. This ensures that it doesn't turn into a soggy mess while in the oven.

I really like this recipe, but it came out a little bland. I had to add some salsa after cooking. I think next time I might add something to spice it up a little. The family liked it!

My boyfriend and I loved this.  We made a few small changes.  I added a jalapeno and a hotter pepper to the onions.  For the chicken, I marinated 2 chicken breasts in a mixture of 2Tbs Worcestershire sauce, 2 Tbs soy sauce, 2Tbs apple cider vinegar, 2tsp chili powder and a dash of hot sauce.  I let the chicken sit for a few hours and then the boyfriend cooked the chicken on the grill until done all the way through.  After that, we cooked the recipe as it states and it was delicious!!!

My husband liked this recipe, but I was not a fan. Too bland if  made exactly like recipe states. I won't be making this again unless my husband wants it.

Two chicken breasts cooked in the crock pot on low with salt, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, and a little bit of water. Let chicken cook and then shred with two forks. Put back in the crockpot. Add salsa, two tablespoons cream of chicken mixture, one cup Mexican cheese, and sautéed onions. Add to cream of chicken mixture a few shakes of Frank's red hot and a squirt of Sriracha. Used corn tortillas (gluten allergy) and doubled up on them. Fill with chicken mixture, throw in baking dish, sprinkle Monterey Jack mix over, cover with foil and bake. After twenty minutes pull off foil and layer top with green onions, tomatoes, and black olives. Pop back in oven for five more minutes.

This does not need changed at all. I've made it a couple times now and it is perfect. My husband prefers lots of cheese though so I add some to the filling.

We made this with a can of Cream of Mushroom soup (condensed) instead of Cream of Chicken, because we had some on hand, and it tasted great. We boiled a couple chicken breasts and shredded them, a great low-fat way to cook the chicken without drying it out. Great creamy flavor! Not exactly "Mexican", but you could definitely spice it up by using frozen green chiles instead of canned. So easy, too. Next time I'd like to try it with low-fat sour cream.

I've been making this recipe for about 5 years so I figure it's time to review it. I don't usually care for cream of chicken soup (I prefer mushroom), but I love it in this. My husband absolutely loves these! I always add a can of enchilada sauce on top;) just makes them that much better! I'm going to try it with corn tortillas next time.

My family loves this recipe! Instead of green chilies we have always added a can of rotel, it adds a little spicy to the mix but we love it that way! And I use a little paprika, cumin salt and pepper as well. To make things faster instead I just add soup mixture to the chicken and onion mixture, it tastes the same because its all getting mixed together anyway.

I made this recipe with a few changes; I mixed cayenne pepper, salsa, and Velveeta cheese with the chicken and I added refrained beans and salsa to the top layer. I also mixed the bottom portion of soup with cooked white rice for the bed. It was delicious with just the right flavor and kick.

This recipe was good. I added a can of black beans to mine, and something that I wish I thought about before as well was enchilada sauce. I feel that it is lacking in ingredients, but once you add more of your own like I did, it was delicious!

It came out really, really well. I've never made   "enchi's" with flour tortillas. I really liked the variation from corn. I added cheese inside along with the chicken just for a bit more cheesy goodness...????

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!!  The only change I made was using a small can of chili verde instead of the chopped green chili.  The best enchiladas I've ever made!

This recipe is delicious!  My children AND my husband all love it (me, too!)!  I throw a handful of cheese into the chicken and sauce mix, just to mix it up.  This is a recipe I use all the time!

I tried this because I wanted to do something different than a traditional enchilada, and this was definitely different.  The cream of chicken soup did make it creamy but it was just OK.  I would definitely add salsa to the soup mixture to give it a little something extra.

Easy recipe - especially if you have chicken or turkey pre-cooked.  Good flavor and the kids liked it.  I tried cooking it for a shorter period of time at a higher temperature b/c I was tight on time.  Don't... it made the bottom of the tortillas hard.  I'll make this again, but stick to the instructions next time.

I am not a fan of this recipe. Besides being dull the texture was gummy..I have wanted to try this recipe for awhile so I just went for it..I should have used my better judgment and made major adjustments. Sorry folks.

Used salsa since I didn't have green chilies. Added lots of cheese. Used pepper jack cheese. Yummy! Will make this again.

This gets 6 stars because my 4 year-old loved it and was able to help with the cooking! I have made this recipe a few times and I always use rotel instead of green chilis. My husband says its not spicey enough, but I like it just fine. Very good!

Yes I added taco seasoning and diced tomatoes with the green chillies. Made double the sauce, cooked the chicken in half of the sauce and uses the other half to spoon over the top. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour.

I hadn't made this in forever and decided to again tonight, then I remembered why. Next time I would add more spices and double the filling part. Made it exactly as instructed and I barely had enough filling for 7 tortillas using 1/4c. I don't feel like that's enough filling.

Phenomenal!!!  I doubled the amount of sour cream & soup. Didn't think there was enough to cover the enchiladas. Added 1/2 c. chopped jalapeños to the chicken with the green chills.

This is a family favorite! The only changes that I make is I use 2 tablespoons of butter, 1 large onion, 1 1/2 tsp of chilli powder, 1lb of fresh chicken breast or chicken tenders (which I season & cook in garlic flavored fuse olive oil & chicken broth until done, then shred), and 2 (4 oz cans) of green  chillis!!

Great recipe with a few tweeks.  While cooking the chicken I toss in some salsa and let it cook together.  This gives the chicken a ton of flavor.  You can pick the intensity of the heat by using mild, medium, or hot.

This has been a regular weekly dish at our house.  I too like a kick, so I add in some hot sauce in both mixtures.  I also like to use hot peppered chiles.  This usually makes about 5 enchiladas for me.

This was great and easy to make. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of ghost pepper sauce to the soup mix and a can of 8oz diced jalapenos to the chicken mixture. I also seasoned the chicken taco seasoning.

I've been making this recipe (with some different measurements) for about 15 years.  It's kind of a "jumping-off-point" recipe.  You can make it as-is and it's great, or you can monkey with it and add all kids of stuff... black beans, refried beans, corn, Rotel, rice, jalapenos, chicken grilled/boiled/baked or rotisserie, corn tortillas, whatever's hanging out in your cupboard, and it comes out yummy.  It's one of those "it's-so-easy-you-can-make-it-out-of-your-brain" recipes, and I almost always have everything on hand.  My 11 year old will eat this and he doesn't eat anything except peanut butter, eggs, broccoli, and macaroni, so you KNOW it's good.

I really liked it. I used half corned flour tortillas and added a little cayenne pepper for some extra spice. I also didn't have the normal cream of chicken so it used cream of chicken and mushroom, which is what I had. Turned out so good.

We used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and we used a fiber filled tortilla rather than a plain flour one. It still came out Great! The cheese and sauce on top really makes it delicious.

These enchiladas are very good.  I double the recipe to make 8 enchiladas because we love leftovers!  The key is to have plenty of sauce!

Very good! My boyfriend is a very picky eater and he loves this dish...I would just slice jalepenos and place on top before putting in the oven next time.

FAMILY LOVED IT with my modification as below after reading reviews.  Cooked chicken in frying pan with Wildtree Rotisserie Chicken Blend, cooked onions and chili powder as directed, added 1 can of Rotel mild diced tomatoes w/green chilis and 1 10 oz can of mild green chile enchilada sauce, about 1/2 cup of medium salsa and some season salt.  Filled tortillas with filling and seared them in hot frying pan before adding to baking dish - followed rest of directions.

This was very good! I did add a few more spices and some bell peppers and garlic to the filling. Probably quite a bit more cheese on top, and foil to cover while baking. Topped with a sprinkle of crushed black pepper, cumin, sliced avocado and some chopped Serrano peppers for those who wanted more heat. Delicious!

This is a great recipe with a little tweaking. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and added a cup of Salsa Verde to the sauce. I then mixed the chicken with half the sauce to spoon into the tortillas and used the rest of the sauce to cover the enchiladas. Definitely will make this again!

I love these for when I'm looking for something simple and mild. I love spicy but the kids don't. Add 1 cup salsa, pepper jack cheese, or spicy green chilies instead of the mild. We all love this.

This recipe is one of the best chicken enchilada recipes I have made. I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat and the only change I made was I flavored the meat with taco seasoning following the directions on the seasoning. Just as good warmed up too!

I modified this recipe by adding a can of enchilada sauce and instead of the sour cream I used one block of cream cheese. My family said they were the best enchiladas I had ever made! They were a hit!

I sliced up two large chicken breasts into strips and cooked in a slow cooker on low for 2.5 hours with 1 cup of Costco salsa, a sprinkling of garlic salt, onion powder, and a couple cloves of minced garlic. This made about 3 cups of chicken, then I continued the recipe as normal using the same measurements even though I had extra chicken. It made 12 enchiladas which worked well for an 8x13 pan. I cooked it for 15 minutes then put the cheese on top and cooked it for another 10 minutes. So perfect!

I generally try to stick to the recipes on here unless I am out of something. When I was making this dish, I accidentally grabbed and opened a can of Campbell's condensed Cheddar Soup instead of the Cream of Chicken. I figured I would use it since I opened it and I think I will continue to use the Cheddar Soup. My husband and I both found it to be very flavorful. I omitted the green chilies as I did not have any on hand, and I also cooked the enchiladas on top of prepared white rice and yellow corn. I covered the top with Enchilada sauce and Monterey Jack Cheese before baking and served it with sour cream and some guacamole. As for the chicken, I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic, and chili powder before baking it. Pretty easy, very delicious! Made it again for family who were in town and everyone really enjoyed it.

good quick easy meal that the kids can help make and will eat.  Make two pans, one spicy and one using the original recipe with additional spices as needed. I'm not a fan of Mexican but this is decent for a weeknight meal, especially in a pinch!

I made this tonight and everyone loved it! I sautéed fresh garlic and minced onion in the butter along with the chili powder, then added raw diced chicken and cooked for about 10 minutes before adding the 2 Tbsp of sauce. I omitted the green chilies. Instead as I was filling the tortilla, I added a Tbsp of petite diced tomatoes and a little cheese to each enchilada. They turned out creamy and very flavorful!

I made this for my three children (ages 20, 15 & 13) and they loved it. The only thing I did different was added some Frank's Hot Sauce because the sauce was a little too bland for me at first. But these were so good, and I my kids have already requested that I make them again.

Even my little brother (who is extremely picky and hates Mexican food) likes this recipe. I found it to be great as well!

I made this for the first time and it was very good, but my youngest child did not like it :)  You MUST season this dish. I put cumin, garlic salt, a couple dabs of mild taco sauce, and a little chili powder in the meat mixture (with the onions and green chillies), and also in the soup/sour cream mixture. I used a few tablespoons more of the soup mixture in with the meat mixture than the recipe called for as well. This tasted like a dish from Chevy's. Very good, will make again.

It was a hit with the boyfriend.  I used canned chicken which made it easier and upped the green chilies just a bit.  I also served with good salsa on the side as it does need a bit of additional zing.

I made this for dinner last night for my husband and myself. I changed a few things, but mostly kept the recipe the same.

When sauteing the onion/chili powder I also added some salt and pepper for added seasoning. I used 2 cups of frozen diced chicken, heated it up when I tossed it in with the green chilies and two tablespoons of the soup mixture. When filling the flour tortillas, I also sprinkled some Mexican cheese blend in. On the bottom of the pan I put a little bet of the soup mixture (but not enough to make it soggy). On top I put the remaining soup mixture and some green onions. It turned out absolutely delicious, wasn't bland in the least bit. My husband absolutely loved them. It gave us leftovers for lunch which were even really good heated up. It was super easy, will definitely make again :)

This was great, but would have been bland without the one addition I made: I added a small can of enchilada sauce (about 1/3 to chicken mixture and 2/3 to soup mixture).  I put some hot sauce on top of my serving and it was perfect!  I also might try it with corn tortillas next time...

I should have had more realistic expectations when I saw the cream of mushroom soup, but the pictures swayed me to try it. It's basically just a variation of a chicken casserole. I added spinach bc it was sorely lacking in any healthy aspect but it was just ok

Okay I am from Southern Colorado/Northern New Mexico, WAY TOO BLAND!  I added more chili powder and some hot salsa to the chicken while it was cooking.  Much, MUCH better.

We loved this dish.  I was skeptical at first because of the cream of chicken soup but it just adds moisture & you can't really taste it.  The next time I makes this, I am going to double recipe so we can have some leftovers.

Loved this recipe. All the leftovers were gone quickly. They were fighting over them! I usually make refried beans or spanish rice to go with these. I still have leftover sides but not leftover enchiladas.

Another perfectly easy and yummy recipe.  The kids gave it rave reviews at the first bite.  They thought it might be slightly spicy, but they loved it anyway.  I plan to try it with Target's raspberry salsa next time.  Total thumbs up!

Quite easy to make and tasty, but rather bland. Serve up with some salsa or other hot sauce.

Didn't have time to read reviews.  Added lemon juice, red pepper, fresh corn kernels, but not the needed spices.  Definitely bland - needed salsa and green onions and?

easy, tasty and a go-to when lost for something to fix for dinner. I do add jalapenos at the end for some extra heat!
