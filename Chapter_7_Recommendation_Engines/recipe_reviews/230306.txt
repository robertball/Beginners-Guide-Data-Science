One of my favorite holiday cocktails. This can also be made with Godiva chocolate liqueur instead of the white creme de cacoa for those who like the peppermint bark that is layered.

We used this recipe as the signature cocktail for our New Year's Eve party and it was a big hit.  I accidentally purchased green creme de menthe instead of white, but with the red sugar rim and the addition of a candy cane the green made a beautiful presentation.  These are strong martinis, but they make wonderful sipping drinks for cocktail parties. I'll definitely use this recipe again.  Next time I'll try using the chocolate liqueur.

Really, really good. So good I had two. ?? I thought the recipe called for a splash of half and half so I used just a bit of f/f 1/2 1/2. But that must have been another recipe I saw. So it was really good with 1/2 1/2. Would be stronger without and I'm sure I'd like it that way too!

Made this with Godiva chocolate liquor as another reviewer suggested. Strong, but very good.

I will definitely make it again but found the Creme de Menthe a little too much. So next time I will add less of that and more Schnapps or try the chocolate liquor.

I had to use green creme de menthe because they didn't have any white.  It was very syrupy and the 1/2 oz seemed like too much.  I'll probably throw it away and try to make it without it.  Maybe add some 1/2 n 1/2 like another reviewer suggested.  Also didn't care for the candy cane rim.  Wouldn't make again.

I used Stoli brand vanilla-flavored vodka. I didn't know there was any drink we couldn't drink!  With the others rating it a 4 and 5 star, I'll have to try again, adding some half and half, as others suggested.

Really good...4.5 stars!  Followed recipe to a T.  I give 4 stars as it was very tasty, but a bit too minty.  Hubs gives 5 stars...perfect!  Definitely a sipper - there's quite a kick.  Fun and festive drink for the holidays.  Will definitely make again!
