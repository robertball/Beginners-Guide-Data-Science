Is very refreshing,  I used fresh watermelon , which I blended first so I had something watery , that way is easier to blend the rest of the ingredients.

I did not care for this smoothie. I made 1/3 of a recipe to try it, or about 2 servings. It has way too many things in it that didn't come together well. It had a watermelon bubblegum type color and flavor, that I found really odd. I normally really like watermelon in a smoothie. Also, I have a Vitamix blender that can blend things very well and I couldn't get this to budge without adding a little liquid. My watermelon was frozen, so could have been part of the issue. However, this smoothie has no liquid and uses both frozen fruits and ice. I am rating this a 3, because like most recipes I can probably fix or tweak it. Too much fruit to go to waste here.
