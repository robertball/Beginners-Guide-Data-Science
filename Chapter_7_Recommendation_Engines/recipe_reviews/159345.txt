This was the greatest recipe for soup I have ever had!!!  I omitted the garbanzo beans, red peppers, and parmesan cheese, which took the calories per cup down to 150 - I think it's the olive oil that makes it taste so good, and if you're using bouillion, I highly recommend "Better than Bouillion" - lower in sodium, and tastes more like real chicken broth straight from the stock pot!

Great recipe!  My husband even likes it (and he's not a big broth soup fan).  I added a roma tomato, mushrooms, and topped with avocado.  Delicious!

I liked this one. I tried it with white rice. I served some rice on a bowl, then I served the soup on top and it tasted really good.

I made this recipe because I was trying to empty out my fridge. I did not make this recipe because I thought it sounded like a great recipe, I thought that it would be filling and help make room for new stuff. Was I ever wrong!! This was really good. My dad, who does not like soup, took seconds!! Without being asked. I made this mostly how it calls for, except that I sauteed cut up chicken thighs, I didn't poach and shred. And I used an immersion blender to chunk up the potatoes a bit after they were mostly cooked. I did end up shredding some of the chicken in the process, but it worked. Will definitely be making this again.

This soup is AWESOME!  Hubby and I were able to stop eating it ONLY after our stomachs protested that they were way too full!  Very filling soup.  Made a few changes: 1/2 diced onion, 1 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. miso. I didn't have roasted red peppers, so I used 1/2 c. diced green pepper and roasted it in a black iron skillet in 1 t. olive oil and 1/2 t. sugar (could use soy sauce instead of sugar if not using miso) till the edges were brown. Left out the Parmesan cheese and served over jasmine rice.  Added pepper to taste in individual bowls. This is definitely going in our regular rotation! YUM!!

Excellent soup! Instead of poaching the chicken I browned it with lemon pepper seasoning in the soup pot. That added a lot of flavor to the broth. Also added some carrots, celery and leeks that I needed to use up (and let's face it, you can never go wrong putting those veggies in a soup!). Used 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken stock.

A great comfort food and perfect for a rainy day.  I love soups anyway, but this one was quick, easy and fairly inexpensive to make.  I liked that it was easy on the stomach and YUMMY too!

This is a tasty dish, however I would double to triple the spinach and red pepper. I added a tomatoe which tasted great in it, also I don't think I'll add garbanzo beans again they're kinda outta place in this dish...textures off. Otherwise everything else was really good.

Just made this and it was amazing! (I didn't have any garbanzo beans or red peppers) The only thing I did differently was to add a bunch of diced carrots to the onion/garlic mixture. I will make this again!

Nice soup. My children enjoyed it. I didn't add extra salt as I wanted to reduce the salt. I didn't have the red peppers so omitted them too. I also reduced the garlic a bit. It was a nice combination of ingredients and to me it felt smooth and tasted kind of buttery/creamy.

This was absolutely Delicious!! Looks so beautiful, healthy and easy. I omitted garbanzo beans and roasted red peppers since I had none. I even forgot to add Parmesan at the end and still tasted yummy.

Came out very good, even on the first try. I used Cannellini beans instead of Garbanzo. Instead of cooking the potatoes and onions separate and then adding the chicken back in I just cooked them all together, let it simmer for 45 minutes, then added the beans, red pepper and spinach and let it simmer for another 20ish minutes.

This was good! I ended up adding a splash of cream to give it a creamy taste, but it's really good either way. It's not overly seasoned or anything, but it makes a nice comfort meal that my kids will eat too.

This recipes is very easy to make. I added celery, and replaced the spinach with kale and potatoes with an additional can of beans. This recipe is a winner in our home.

This is one of the best soups I have ever tasted.  I did the recipe as stated with two exceptions.  1.  Did not add roasted red peppers.  I might if I had them, but didn't.  2.  Added 1 tsp of file powder 5 minutes from serving to thicken the broth just a touch.  Thanks, not a chef!

Delicious and very easy! I didn't bother to cool chicken and shred it - I just chopped it before cooking it. I used dried onion and dried cayenne, since they were what I had on hand; and I added a huge overripe tomato. It was just divine on a snowy night with a loaf of bread!

I added a roma tomato and a tsp of sundried tomato paste, and then pureed the entire thing for my baby.  He Loved it.  Capscicum addition was a great idea.

This was okay as is. I think it could use some sort of spicy sausage. A little on the bland side.

This was a nice, light (but hearty) soup! It's not quite as heavy as a traditional thick & creamy potato soup, but it is still very satisfying without the caloric guilt. I did make a couple changes — I omitted the garbanzo beans and added carrots instead. I also omitted the parmesan cheese and added 1/4 cup, plus or minus, of 2% milk to thicken the stock slightly. Final result... a pretty tasty & delicate soup!

Just found this so-so. Thought the flavor of garlic and onions was too strong, but somehow the whole thing was kind of bland, needed some other spices.

Disclaimer: I didn't have a few ingredients so I had to make a few modifications... but it was delicious! I left out the garbanzo beans and red peppers because I did not have them, and used leftover grilled chicken re-heated in the broth/water mixture. I added some crushed red pepper to the onions/garlic for spice, and the potatoes only took about 10 minutes to cook once I added the cooking liquid. For the last 5 minutes I added the Parmesan, Spinach,  some Crumbled Bacon and some tempered Greek Yogurt for creaminess. It had great depth of flavor for such a short cook-time! This recipe is so versatile, I will definitely be making this again with whatever ingredients I have on hand ;)

This is a great recipe! I used tofu in place of the chicken, and went without the beans. It was very tasty and I'll definitely be making this again! :)

This soup is packed with nutrients. It was a huge hit with my husband.   I made a few changes, and it came out great. I used 3 cups of chicken stock and 3 cups of water (rather than 2 and 4, respectively), a little more chicken than recommended, and a 25-oz can of chick peas. Instead of 2 potatoes, I chose 1 russet, 1 golden yukon, and 1 sweet potato for variety. I left out the red pepper and Parmesan cheese, but added the rest of the ingredients as written.  To make the meal special, I served the soup in whole-wheat sourdough bread bowls.

This was a great soup, I didn't have to add any extra salt even though I used a sodium-reduced broth. I reversed the ratio of water to stock for a stronger flavour but added more water than called for (needed the volume to cook up excess chicken which I stored for wraps later). I also grated the parmesan onto the individual bowls and topped with fresh green onion before serving. Great recipe with tonnes of protein, next time might take out one of the proteins and add noodles instead!

A tasty soup that allows for a lot of improvisation or add-ins: chopped avocado, bacon bits, even more lentils, or fried, firm tofu instead of chicken.  We really enjoyed the great flavors!

This is the perfect recipe if you want a change of pace.  One of the few recipes where I wouldn't change a thing.  My daughter thought more spinach would have been great.

Super easy and yummy. We didn’t have any beans, so I made it without, and didn’t feel like it was missing anything at all.

Very delicious soup!! I was pleasantly surprised by it!
What I did personally was that I omitted the garbanzo beans (we don't care for them) and bell peppers (did not have any this time). Instead I chopped up three large carrots and used minced garlic from a jar,and added that with the spinach and potatoes (the spinach or any similar green gives it a nice delicious, leafy crunch by the way. Definitely use veggies in a soup. :-)

Plus, you may possibly end up with not enough broth. In case you'll have to make do with what you have to make more - such as chicken stock or more water to simmer in with the chicken flavor. I also added lots of parmesan cheese, probably more than was stated in the recipe. Delicious! And I'm also adding more as I'm eating the leftovers for breakfast this morning.

Overall, this soup is DELICIOUS and I'll definitely make it again along with any other soups I want to try. You can always add a few minor alterations depending on your taste preferences. Great for a cool - weather dinner and any quick, delicious meal.

Loved it!  I made it in the crockpot and did not cook the chicken.  At the end of 8 hours on low I added a cut up block of cream cheese, let it melt and stirred it in! :)

I used leftover cooked chicken and broth made from the chicken breast bones  (boil 20 mins, harvest what chicken was left on the bones and the broth).  The secret is you should grate the potatoes, not cut them in chunks.  The soup cooks faster and gives you a nice creamy texture.  I forgot to add the parmesan, added some dry parsley, a cup of frozen peas and a pkg of frozen spinach.   This is a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe! Very hearty and satisfying. I tweaked it according to what I had on hand. I used lentils instead of garbanzo, I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water, I also added shredded carrots and cabbage and cayenne. Fantastic! I will be making this all winter, definitely a comfort food! Thank-you for this :)

Excellent!  I made my own chicken stock, and just used the chicken that fell of the bones.  Changed it a little too.  Didn't use garbanzo beans or peppers, and added three bullion cubes.  One of the best soups I've had!

This soup is great! I added andouille sausage and red pepper flakes, reduced the liquid to 4 cups (2 cups stock, 1 cup white wine and 1 cup water), and browned the chicken thighs in oil and lemon pepper. After browning the chicken, I took it out to cut up, then cooked the garlic and onion in the same pot, then added the potatoes, liquid and cut-up chicken back in to cook together.  This sped up the overall cooking time and also let the flavors meld together better. I put in the pre-cooked sausage (which made the dish in my opinion) at the same time as the beans and spinach. With the andouille sausage and red pepper flakes, this soup was a flavorful hit on a cold night.

Made this last night with the chicken I had leftover from Christmas dinner. I sautéed the spinach and chickpeas in the onions, garlic and peppers to add a little flavor to them before combining with the broth, chicken and potatoes. My husband (who rarely compliments food) said "good soup, babe," so I'm giving this 5 stars!

I thought this was quite bland.  I added a tsp of curry powder which helped and then followed another reviewer's suggestion to thicken it up with a touch of the immersion blender.  We'll eat it but I won't make it again without a lot of upgrades.

If I could, I would give it 10 stars!!  I used cubed cooked chicken leg meat, lots of garlic, lots of onion and added grated white cheese on top.  I added an individual portion of fresh spinach to each bowl, filled with soup and microwaved it for a couple of minutes.  Yummm!!!

I just tried this soup for the first time and I was blown away by its flavor and all-around awesomeness! I made a few changes, based on the ingredients I had on hand: great northern beans instead of garbanzo; no peppers; forgot the cheese. I used turkey instead of chicken, and I used red potatoes. It is THE soup for non-soup people!

OMG this was sooo good and easy!  I changed this up slightly, so that it was a one pot dish.  I sauteed the onions and garlic, then pushed those to one side to brown the chicken in the same skillet.  I deglazed with some red wine, since I had just opened a bottle.  Then I added the potatoes and water/broth and simmered until everything was cooked through.  I generally like thicker broths, while my fiance likes thinner broths, and this was a perfect compromise.  Was also great because you could throw in any veggies that you have!  We only had great northern beans, so I used those.  I also didn't bother with the cheese because I thought it had plenty of flavor without.

Nice, good looking soup - love the high garlic level.  Something seemed off with using chicken thighs, though, they don't shred very well, and were almost tough in comparison to to the other ingredients.  I'd make it again, but with chicken breast, I think.
