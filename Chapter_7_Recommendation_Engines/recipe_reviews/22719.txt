This is great with either French or regular cut green beans! This is our favorite way to eat green beans now. Thanks for the recipe.

I skipped the dill, and used real cheese instead.  Mozzarella works great- the salty taste is wonderful.  I also add some margarine for extra flavor.  Everyone loves it whenever I make it, and I always have to make extras!  I will keep on using this recipe, and changing cheeses, fun to experiment with something that already tastes good.

GREAT recipe!!  A nice change from the everyday.  I added some bacon crumbles to the top and omitted the dill.  A big hit with my nearly 2 year old!

How can you go wrong with something healthy paired with lots of processed cheese, thanks.

This was really good. I used home-canned green beans and added salt and pepper. I also poured in some evaporated milk to make it more of a cheese sauce than just melted cheese. I will definitely make this often with our garden green beans.

Not a very good dish. Way to much dill flavor. The green beans with the cheese is a good idea with maybe some garlic or some other herb but the flavor dill added was not a winner... ;-(

I used a queso cheese sauce and sprinkled chili powder on top.  I used partially thawed frozen green beans (40 oz) because I don't like canned--if you do this, be sure to cook the beans first!  I didn't and mine turned out too crunchy, even after being in the oven for 30 minutes.  I'll have to make this again.

Due to the over-abundance of green beans in the garden has forced me to find a multitude of ways to cook these (my least favorite vegetable)...so I tried this. My boyfriend and I were only so-so on these but my roommate and daughter liked them alot! If you topped these with those french fried onions - I bet this would closely resemble those popular green bean hotdishes I hear are popular. Thanks!

The taste of the cheese overwhelmed the beans & dill (in fact didn't even taste the dill). I do like Velveeta & it was tasty when hot & freshly melted, but there was too much cheese for the amount of beans & it coagulated too much when it cooled.

I'm not a big fan of Velveeta so I made a homemade cheese sauce from this site. The dill added a nice touch.

I used fresh, rather than frozen, beans.  A tasty and different way of serving them.  This is a recipe I will make again.
