I love corn bread but don’t love the calories/fat. So I thought I’d give this a try with a few modifications: used 3/4c Whole Wheat Flour and 1/2c All-Purpose Flour instead of all All-Purpose Flour, Fat-Free Evaporated Milk instead of skim milk (didn’t have any), 4tbsp Splenda rather than 7 as I don’t like it too sweet, and olive oil rather than canola for extra flavor.  They were delicious! This recipe made 12 moist, dense and flavorful, 2.5 WW point muffins. I’ll be sure to make these little treats every time I make turkey chili!

Wow, Corn Cake is right. Doesn't anyone make cornbread without sweetener in it. This is just way too sweet. Sorry. I've got to give it1 star
