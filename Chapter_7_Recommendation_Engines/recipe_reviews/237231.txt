Very good! I only used peas, no asparagus or mushrooms and my husband couldn't eat it fast enough!

This turned out pretty well. DH wants me to make it again some time. I used only peas. DH doesn't like mushrooms, so I left those out and used cream of celery soup instead. When making the sauce, I ended up adding another 1/2 c of milk because it was so thick. I didn't use the optional ricotta because I didn't have any. My sauce was a bit too salty for me with all the ingredients, and I think the ricotta would have helped mellow it. I ended up adding some sour cream, and that helped with the saltiness. I doubled the bacon (removing half the drippings) and used about 14 meatballs. Overall, nice recipe that is easily tweaked to your preferences.

This was tasty! I didnt have bacon or asparagus and I also added sour cream but otherwise I followed the recipe and my husband and I enjoyed it greatly! Its a different kind of recipe from anything else Ive ever tasted - a nice change from the usual flavors!

I made this as a meatball dish rather than as a meal, so I didn't make the pasta or add the asparagus or mushrooms.  After reading several reviews, I decided to use skim milk rather than whole milk.  I doubled some of the "gravy" recipe and used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery -  I also added a few dollops of sour cream.  I also tripled the amount of bacon and ranch seasoning.  Everyone loved it and even used the extra gravy over their mashed potatoes.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this to the letter and found it lacking just a little flavor.   When I added salt and a touch of balsamic vinegar to it on my plate it was pretty tasty.  I will make this again .

It was ok. I was hoping for more flavor especially since it had the ranch dressing in it. I couldn't taste it at all. It was also a little too thick. If you make this, add more milk.
