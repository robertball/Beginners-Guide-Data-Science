Excellent! I reduced the beef and this time also added a bunch of chopped fresh green beans for veggies and to stretch it, and it was an amazing combo. Oh, and I also use regular canned minestrone from a healthier brand rather than the condensed Campbell's stuff, which is full of scary food additives. Definitely a keeper here!!

Very good. I originally envisioned this like an entree - kinda' like a chili - but I think it was more of a side dish.

My mother was a vegetarian so I like most all beans.  My wife is not a big bean fan but I talked her into making this.  We found low fat minestrone soup so the sodium was greatly reduced but not the flavor. My wife and I both loved this and will make it often! Even I can make it!!

Absolutely fabulous!!!  This is a new family favorite.  I made it one night for dinner and then next day I made double the recipe and gave some to neighbors and friends at work; they all loved it too.

This recipe is so easy, but really tastes homemade.  I didn't add anything to it except some salt and pepper.  My kids ate it but picked at it a bit because of all the differant ingredients in the soup.  Its great to make in a hurry or leave in a crock pot to simmer for awhile.  Tastes even better the 2nd day if you have any leftovers!  Thanks Tammie for the easy & quick delicious meal.

This really is quick and easy, but the
combination of flavors makes it taste
like more effort went into it.

Not bad, but not as good as I hoped it would be.  May try again and tweak a bit.

After reading the reviews, I was surprised that my family and I didn't care for this dish too much. I think the ranch beans were too over-powering. Maybe it was the brand (B&M)  beans. I'm not sure, but I won't bother to make it again.
