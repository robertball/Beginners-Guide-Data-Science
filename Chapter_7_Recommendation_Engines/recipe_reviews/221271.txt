Talk about great FLAVOR - this is it!  Chef John has done it again.  Perfect as written, no need to change a thing.  As I was making this, I was second guessing the recipe - 'Maybe I should brown the chicken....' etc...etc...  I decided to trust the recipe and I am so glad I did.  One comment - there is a lot of chicken fat that needs to be skimmed off.  If making this for company I would make the whole thing the day before - remove the chicken and vegetables - skim off as much fat as possible and refrigerate it - then skim off more fat once it had thoroughly chilled.  Re-heat on low - make the rice and you have a wonderful, flavorful, easy meal.  ****  NOTE:  You can use chicken pieces in this but they need to be bone in, skin on to give this dish that extra flavor.   Remove the skin and bones prior to adding the chicken back into the sauce.  Thanks Chef John for another keeper to add into the rotation.

People watch to video.  Chef Johns says the sour cream will break and curdle and shows how to fix that.  It also clearly shows the chicken is only half submerged in the liquid.  That is why you turn it over.  Please don't knock a recipe because you didn't do it correctly!  This is great.  Just know what you are supposed to do before you start cooking.

Oh my goodness, this is one of the best meals I've ever made! I used 4 chicken legs with the thighs attached because I didn't want to take a whole chicken out and cut it up. It cooked faster, about 1 hour. Also, I was worried it would be too spicy for my kids, so I only added 1 jalapeño. It gave nice flavor, but no spice at all, so if you like a little zip I don't think both jalapeños and the cayenne pepper would be too much at all. I will put them all in next time. Amazing & awesome! Thank you for a great recipe!

Prepared as recipe stated, but had two problems. The recipe listed sour cream as an option, which I used; however, this separated even though I did not even bring it to a boil. Very unappealing to the eye.  Secondly, with the liquid listed, my chicken was not even close to submerged.  I did add one more cup of liquid and equivalent spices so that the liquid was close to the top of the chicken.  Flavor was good, but did not look good.

Oh! MY!  I made this recipe for dinner tonight, and it was absolutely delicious!  I recommend highly that you try this recipe.  At first, I thought that it was going to be too spicy with the jalapeños, but surprisingly, it was mild.  I am not lying, this was restaurant good!  And easy to make!  This will be something I make again on a cold winter's day.

Excellent! I used a can of Rotel tomatoes and added a bag of frozen green peas and served it over rice. I also thickened it with a little arrowroot. Very delicious!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!! I did add some corn starch to thicken the sauce, though, but otherwise pretty much followed the directions exactly. Served it with Mexican rice, re-fried beans, and corn tortillas.

This was delicious. I wanted a lower fat version so I used 2 1/2 lbs of Chicken Tenders instead of the whole chicken. I did not give up the sour cream yet by using skinless breasts it did eliminate a good bit of the fat calories and this dish was still amazing. I used roasted jarred red peppers. I added the cilantro toward the end so that the fresh flavor was not cooked out of it. I did not add the sour cream until I had taken the chicken out of the broth at the very end just before serving. I could see that the broth was very thin and I desired it thicker so I mixed 1/4c of Wondra flour into the sour cream making sure that the flour and sour cream were well mixed before I added it....did not want any flour lumps. I then added the mixture to the broth at a low temp and mixed until it thickened. It came out beautifully thickened and the sour cream sauce stayed perfect. Be patient with the thickening at the lower temperature....you do NOT want to boil the sour cream or it will separate.

I made it exactly as written, I even made my own Mexican crema. The flavour is missing something but I'm not sure what that something is.

Not bad, good flavor. The liquid was too thin and it really isn't a creme sauce, more like a soup.  I even tried to add some corn starch to thicken it and make it more like sauce. Didn't work. I served it with some Spanish rice, added some fresh avocado like the picture shows and topped it with Mexican style cheeses. It was good!!

LOVED the flavor of this dish. I will be making it again and again. I followed the recipe as is but thickened the broth with a little flour at the end since i like it thicker. Thanks for the recipe!YUMMY

I made this tonight for dinner.  I cut out one jalapeno and the red peppers as the bride doesn't like them.  Tossed everything into a pot but the chicken wasn't covered.  Since the directions said to submerge everything...I added 1 more cup broth, water and half cup crema which probably watered down the...soup(?) and most likely diluted some of the flavor as well.  Then I watched the video afterwards and the chicken wasn't submerged, lol.  I served with some white rice as well.

This is a good recipe, I made it exactly as directed, but I will add more oregano and other seasonings next time and use MUCH less liquid.  NOT necessary to cover the chicken with watery broth.  Simply baste the chicken with the creamy broth as it cooks in the first period. turn it over to finish cooking the breast.  With these changes I give the recipe a 5 and I hope to prepare some rabbit this way adding some dijon mustard

I decided to take another step when I made this today:  I removed the chicken to a different pot, with a slotted spoon removed  all the vegetables into a blender and spun them into a beautiful smooth l sunrise coloured puree which I added to the broth still bubbling in the original pot.   I cut up the chicken and added it back into the broth.  BTW  I used more cream and  one whole chipotle pepper...no jalapeño.

This was just OK for me.   Loved the simplicity and knew it wasn't going to be a "sauce" and would be more of a soup based on reading all the reviews, but it still lacked flavor.    My cream curdled right away just like others reported, but it did iron out some at the end with the high heat like chef John said it would.   Not smooth, but better.  I wonder why you'd put the cream in from the beginning at all when it seems less problematic to add it at the end.   Either way, this bucket of broth that you're left with is way more than you need for one chicken.   My husband  said it was definitely lacking some spices.   I followed the recipe exactly and the amount of heat with 2 jalapenos was perfect (mild).   Still -- just not that interesting.  Doubt I'll try to make it again.

This was pretty good but there was tons of fat!  I used chicken thighs with bone/skin instead of a whole chicken and I cut the recipe in half since my husband is allergic to chicken.  I think I would add more crema if I made this again, seemed a little thinner than I expected.

This was lovely! I especially like how it combines what I would consider some very bold ingredients, but they all blend together so nicely with the creme and chicken to make a warm and comforting meal. The only changes I made were using chicken parts vs. the whole chicken, and I used creme fraiche instead of the mexican crema. Definitely a keeper!

Had a problem that the sour cream separated. Did not look good enough to serve to  company. Good flavor though, would mix in the sour cream after cooking. Also cut down on additional water. Looked like the picture but would prefer a thicker sauce. 
I did read and watch the video, but it seems others have had the same problem with the sour cream. 
Served with a pink bean mixture over rice, good combination.

Good flavor.  Sauce was very watery and sour cream did separate.  Not the creamy consistency I was expecting.  Great dinner for something different though.

This quickly became a favorite meal in our house. The first time I made it, my eldest told me it was the best meal I’ve ever made because she liked it so  much.

I’ve made this many times now, including for company. I cut the spice for my kids and serve it in a bowl over scratch Mexican red rice and top it with chopped avocado, tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream.  So delicious!

This is really really good & very simple to make. I followed the instructions exactly only I used a whole cut-up chicken, because that is what I had on had. It was not very spicy, so anyone that really loves hot food may want to add more cayenne or jalapeno.  But, I loved it as is! Thanks!

I made this recipe tonight and it was amazing. The flavors were for lack of a better word simply comforting. I shouldn't be surprised, Chef John has never disappointed in any of the recipes that I have tried from him. This was really good and my husband really liked it as well. Will be making this again for a long time.

Really great taste! I modified it to use cubed chicken breast. Browned it,  set aside. Added all ingredients and let that boil for 20-30 minutes. Also used diced poblano peppers instead of jalapeno's. 3 cups of chicken broth, no water. Served over rice.

Very good. I did the fast way though. I added less water and after 1 hour was done with chicken cut already.

This was great. I would defininitely make it again!  A few things I modified: I used bone in, skin on, chicken breast.  I also browned it in coconut oil first. Then I threw all of the vegetables in and browned them too.  I let it all boil for just over an hour (I did not add the sour cream until the very end).  Pulled the chicken out and deboned.  Put it back in and added the sour cream once the heat was off.  Topped with fresh cilantro, lime juice and avocado. Served over rice.  Whole family liked it.  I took most of the seeds out of my jalapenos and it had just a tiny bit of kick to it.  Perfect. That will depend on how potent of peppers you get, of course.

Wow amazing flavor!! I even omitted the jalapeño and cayenne peppers and it was still very tasty. I used chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand. Then I served it with Spanish rice and sliced avocado. I think next time I will cook my chicken separately, as I had a lot of the floaty bits of chicken and fat. I tried skimming it all off as it says to do in the instructions but there were a lot of floaty bits...also I think I'll add the crema towards the end. Mine curdled just slightly. Don't get me wrong it was still delicious, just wish it would've looked prettier. Still a 5-star dish!!

This soup was so delicious and flavorful yet so simple. The only thing I did different was make it with cut up legs and thighs. I served it with Mexican rice and extra sour cream. My whole family loved it! Thanks!

Wow! This chicken in cream sauce was absolutely delicious, filling and comforting! Kudos to Chef John! I made it exactly according to the recipe except 1) I used 4.5 lbs of chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken because that is what I had on hand. The "Mexican Crema" I made by following a recipe - 1/2 cup sour cream + 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream + 1/2 teaspoon salt, mix it well, cover and let it sit on the counter for at least an hour (while the soup is simmering) and mix it in the last five minutes of simmering along with the cilantro. Wow, really good.

In my opinion, this recipe deserves more than five stars. I adjusted the quantities to suit me and also adjusted the amount of some of the ingredients to suit my taste; however, I believe this is a recipe that is pretty forgiving. You can easily adjust here and there and it will still come out delicious. I also cooked it in my oven in order to control the temperature instead of on top of the stove. I sauted some carrots then added to the pot. I wanted to use them up. Very good recipe. Thank you.

This recipe is the bomb.    I made it with fat free sour cream and it  cooked up beautifully.  I am planning on bringing this to my Christmas breakfast potluck at the office.  This one is a keeper.

it was good. and was different then my usual. not sure if I'd make it again. I didn't let it boil but the cream ended up looking gross. I let it cool down a lot and then blended the broth by itself. it definitely changed the appearance. I made it with Spanish rice, and put the soup on top.

Awesome! and it's a regular now at my house. I cheat sometimes and buy a pre-cooked chicken from the market, simmer all the other ingredients for about 1 hour, then debone, chop the chicken and add to sauce at the end. Over rice !! YUM!!

This is so, so delicious! I had half of a baked chicken leftover that I wanted to use and try a new dish: this was awesome! I just noticed that I forgot to top with avocado, so I will correct that next time. Otherwise, this is a delicious, rich and creamy comfort food! I will definitely make this again! SOON!!

the spices combined perfectly plus it was very easy, but i changed a little bit. i used dried cilantro instead of fresh one and i put a little bit cornstarch so that the sauce will be thick. i came from Asia and i cooked this recipe with German family and they also like it too.. high five!

I did substitute a poblano pepper for the Jalapeno pepper, as my wife is not one for spicy, however it did make this dish to bland - next time, I am making it as listed! However it was still very good! My whole family loved it.

Tried this tonight and it was muy delicioso!  I used chicken thighs and used the Spanish cream. It looked like it was separating, but after I skimmed the fat, it was fine. Then I saw the video and it looked just like Chef John's! Served it with Spanish rice and my husband loved it!!! And so easy!
