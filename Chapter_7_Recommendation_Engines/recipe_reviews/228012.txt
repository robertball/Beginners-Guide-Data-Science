Somewhat to my surprise, I liked this! I mean, it's tofu, right, and it isn't camouflaged by a sauce, so it's brown, sort of... but it was tasty! Had a somewhat meat-like texture and a rich flavor. Mushrooms would be a nice addition. I put some on top of our dinner salads with a balsamic dressing. It would go well with brown rice too. Worth trying!

This recipe was fantastic! I added some raw cashews and served it over rice. My kids were less enthusiastic, but I will definitely be making it again and experimenting with different add-ins.

Very nice and tasty!  I had doubts about the amount of nutritional yeast, thinking it would be too much, but it was just right.  I added a little broccoli and tomato and served over rice.  I used only 1 teaspoon of low-sodium soy sauce to reduce sodium, but I think it would taste better with the full amount.  For us, this was more like three generous servings.
