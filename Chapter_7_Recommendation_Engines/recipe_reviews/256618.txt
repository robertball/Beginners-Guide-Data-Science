This is easy to put together and pretty tasty. I added some soffritto. It seems hard to believe but it really does get thick like a rag√π in only thirty minutes. I think it's the fact that there is a small ratio of meat to tomatoes, but thanks to the peppers you get a tasty sauce. Thank you for the recipe.
