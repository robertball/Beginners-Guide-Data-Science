Everytime I make these "toffee bars" no one will eat any of the other treats I make! So I usually end up making 2-3 batches at a time so there will be plenty to go around. Something I ALWAYS do is line the pan with foil and lightly spray with cooking spray (if you want to enjoy the cookies and not all the work involved in cleaning the pan)

No greasing or sticking if you use Reynolds Release Foil! I mention this 1st for people have trouble with sticking to the pan. Also I find if you bring to a boil and boil a full 3 minutes; the brown sugar butter mixture will set up perfectly. These are just as great as the soda cracker cookies in this sight. It's hard to tell the difference. But if you compare taste; the saltines bring out the toffee flavors a bit more because of the salt. I made these at Christmas time. I also made these with milk chocolate chips instead of nuts and used 1 cup of toffee bits sold along with chocolate chip section of the baking aisle. My grandson isn't a nut lover and thought these were great this way. My coffee group thought these were a great Valentine Day treat.

The only question is why isn't this recipe famous?? I can't believe it doesn't have hundreds of 5 star reviews! I lined my pan with foil sprayed the foil then layed the graham crackers down. I also simmered the toffee for 3 minutes as suggested. Because I had so much toffee left over I made 2 layers: graham crackers toffee graham crackers toffee then pecans and chocolate.

Similar to a recipe I made but without graham crackers. I like the addition of the graham crackers. My suggestion would be to closely watch it while it is baking - mine did not need 10 minutes. Also I used a rubber spatula to spread the melted chocolate chips around. Yum!

I first tasted this recipe years ago and it's always been a favorite. I moved recently and don't have many of my recipes with me since they are in storage as we wait to move into a new house. So I was thrilled when I found this on here. I always line my pan with foil spray it and let the butter/sugar simmer for a couple minutes so it thickens. I spread the chocolate chips with a spatula and stick them in the frig for a little while to speed up the cooling process. They always come out perfect. I don't even try to break them into nice/neat squares. I treat them like "toffee" and just break them into pieces with jagged ends/corners. These are going to a birthday party with me tonight -- bound to be a surefire hit!

These tasted pretty good but they didn't set up very well for me. Next time I will probably cook the toffee on the stove a little longer. A suggestion for others who plan to make this - make sure you line your pan with foil. It makes for much easier clean-up.

The toffee didn't really set up very well - I may let the sauce cook a little bit longer before putting in the oven. They tasted awesome and the pan was gone the same day that I made them.

These were pretty good - I tried them because they were similar to a recipe I had years ago and lost. Even though I greased the pan well these stuck like glue to my nonstick jelly roll pan and I basically ruined the pan trying to pry them out!

Great but toffee did not set up as hard as I would have liked. I boiled 2 mins and got nervous it would burn...

I make this with and without the chocolate. Without the chocolate it is just as yummy! Also try substituting almonds for pecans.

Awesome midnight desperation snack recipe. Maybe some will be left for tomorrow but not much. By the way I used a well seasoned cookie sheet no greasing or foil--came right off after cooling for a few minutes. Oh and I used Club Crackers--I think that works better than Graham.

Great recipe - forget the foil and the oil spray and just use parchment paper.

loved it. My neice made something like this a few years back. I got the recipe from her and then lost it. Instead of asking her again I thought I would do a search and here it was!
