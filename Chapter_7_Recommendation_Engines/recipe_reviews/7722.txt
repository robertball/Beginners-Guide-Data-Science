Formerly a professional baker, now retired, I can't resist "fooling around" with a
great basic recipe, of which this one is GREAT!  However, I changed the flavorings
by using the juice AND zest of one large lemon, (No lemon extract- use the real
thing!), two tsps. of pure vanilla extract, and, here's the real change, one and a
half tsps. of ground cardamom. When the cake is still warm, remove from tube
pan, and drizzle with a glaze:mix one cup powdered confectioner's sugar, with
enough fresh lemon juice to be runny, ( a consistency like Elmer's glue ). These 
changes take Cathy's wonderful cake and transform it into a GREAT CAKE! Try it!

I thought this recipe was quite good. When making it the second time, I changed a few things. I added 1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup shortening. I also creamed the fats and sugar together for about 5 minutes. I used fresh lemon juice and lemon zest(1 large lemon. After reading the other reviews, noting that it may be a little dry, I added 1/2 cup sour cream. It turned out awesome!!! I will make it this way for now on.

Definitely an awesome cake. I tried this recipe yesterday, and it was DELICIOUS! I baked two cakes, one using a loaf pan and another one using a BUNDT pan. After reading some reviews, for one of them, I tried sprinkling some icing sugar on the pan after oiling it, and it did add a little caramelish-crunchy side to the cake that I liked. My bf prefers cake to be plain, so he prefered the other one (without sugar sprinkled).  I also added two tsp of vanilla extract instead of one and I used real lemon juice:) And finally, I baked it for around 70 mins too, and it was perfect: the crust was a nice shade, and it was yummy! Am glad I tried this recipe:))

=UPDATE=
I tried this recipe around 5-6 times already (all with great success!!)and I noticed a definite change in taste if I beat the butter and the sugar with an electric mixer and if I just mix the butter and sugar MANUALLY. When I beat it with a mixer, it tastes great but it is definitely BETTER if you beat the butter and the sugar with with a wooden spoon. It has a richer taste. Just make sure to beat it well (until the mixture is uniform). Since it's done manually, the sugar will not be creamed with the butter, but don't worry about it coz when it's cooked, there is no grainy texture or anything. Ah, and it tastes AWESOME with almond essence instead of vanilla:)

This was INCREDIBLE. The only change I made was to halve the recipe and bake in a loaf pan for 50 minutes instead of a bundt cake pan for an hour. The BEST pound cake recipe I've ever tried!!!

Thought maybe you'd appreciate a review where someone didn't change, tweak, add to, subtract from, etc., etc.  I baked this cake this morning and didn't change a thing.  It doesn't need tweaking if directions are followed fully.  It is delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.

Classic, reliable pound cake recipe with basic ingredients and standard measurements...3 c. flour, 3 c. sugar, 6 eggs, 1 c. butter.  And the reason why the ingredients and the fairly standard measurements of them are so classic and traditional (note other, similiar recipes) is because it WORKS.  This is one, fine pound cake.  Moist with a delicate and tender crumb.  Exceptional, actually. I made half a recipe and used 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of Creme Bouquet flavoring.  I also added about a cup of fresh blueberries and baked about 30 minutes in a mini rose Bundt cake pan.  I drizzled it with a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Absolutely first rate and delicious.

I was so tickled when I pulled this out of the oven and saw how beautiful it had turned out...considering the 2 adjustments I made.  I substituted brown sugar for the white and left out the lemon flavoring since I didn't have any.  My bundt pan is pretty old and I'm not even sure how many inches in diameter it is.  So, being on the safe side, I baked mine in a 9x13 inch pan.  It turned out perfectly and was completely cooked in about 50 minutes.  The sides of the cake started pulling away from the pan, and so I knew it was done.  Even though the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar...this cake was NOT overly sweet.  The brown sugar complemented the buttermilk flavor very well.  I will keep this one in my recipe box!!  Thanks a million Cathy.

This recipe was very good. Some people said that the original recipe was dry so I added 2oz cream cheese. I also added lemon zest, which made it even better.

This cake tasted very good!  I have a paula deen pound cake recipe I've used for years and this recipe is just as good (and less steps). I halved the recipe and was going to use a regular loaf pan but realized there was not enough batter to bring it up high enough in the pan even after baking.  Instead I used my old standby's, 2 mini loaf pans which worked fine for all the batter to fit.  I baked for 55 minutes total.  Let cool, then served with sue's hot fudge sauce recipe from this site.  Together they were GREAT!  With a scoop of french vanilla ice cream and it would be a WOW!

This was simple to make and so yummy.If you want a denser cake omit one of the egg whites from the 6 eggs.I left out the lemon extract and added more vanilla!!! Yummo! I wish I could give it 10 stars.

This cake was absolutely delicious!  It was very moist and flavorful.  I read all the reviews before I made it.  That is why I love this site because you can check out the reviews before you try a recipe.  I did halve the recipe and bake it in a loaf pan like someone else said.  I didn't want a big cake. I just wanted to test the recipe.  I also added a little lemon zest to the batter, and it was perfect.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar as it is so tasty, you don't need anything else!  Enjoy it, as you won't be disappointed!  I have to be careful with my oven, so I always bake for less than a recipe says!

This pound cake is incredible - and so easy to make!  I used 2 tsp. of vanilla and instead of lemon extract I used a full Tbsp. of real lemon juice and 2 tsp. of lemon zest.  It was so moist and went great with fresh strawberries and REAL whipped cream!

This is a good pound cake. Buttermilk pound cake is a very southern dessert.  I always omit the lemon extract and use more vanilla. I have also used butter extract, rum extract, coconut and almond. All are really good. Sometimes I top the cake with a rum or chocolate glaze. YUM. For the reviewers rating low and saying this cake is too dense, etc. That's what pound cake is! they don't call it "pound" cake for nothing. I've never had a pound cake that was light & fluffy. If you want that, try angel food cake.

I'm the family pound cake baker and this is a good recipe. Here's a helpful hint to anyone baking a poundcake. I always separate the egg whites and add them to the butter and sugar mixture and add the yellow after the flour. It makes the cake lighter and fluffy. Also add a 1/2 pack of instant pudding mix(flavor of choice) and you'll have the softest pound cake in town. Happy baking!!!

I've made this cake several times now, and I think it's perfect as written, although the use of fresh lemon juice and zest might be a good modification.  My cakes were certainly not dry or hard, which suggests to me that some may have baked theirs too long -- I think 90 minutes @ 325 is the extreme.   My oven is well calibrated, and I check the cake after 60 minutes. It's done when it begins to pull away from the sides of the pan.   Also, it's important to cream the butter and sugar well, about 5 minutes on medium speed. The flour should be very gently mixed in about 1/3 at a time, only until it's barely incorporated before adding about 1/3 of the buttermilk, then repeating until it's all added. Over-mixing kills cakes!   BTW, this is a huge cake, but it freezes well. We cut it in thirds and enjoy it for a couple of weeks, with slices of the frozen cake zapped in the microwave for a few seconds, then toasted in the toaster oven and served with vanilla ice cream. OINK!

p.s. Every time I make this cake I have to come back here and double check to make sure I correctly wrote down the amount of baking soda -- it is ¼ teaspoon.

This recipe is fantastic, and after using this recipe numerous times I have a few tips. When you cream the butter and sugar, make sure the butter is soft, but not totally melted. Instead of using lemon extract, I just use real lemon juice. If you're out of buttermilk, a good substitute is just one tablespoon of lemon juice added to one cup of milk. Let the mixture stand for about five minutes, then mix it and use it as buttermilk. I also like a bit of a rum flavor in my pound cake, so I mix in about two to three table spoons of rum along with the milk. Make sure that you beat everything very well after each addition (butter, sugar, eggs, flour, milk, rum) or else when your pound cake gets out of the oven, you'll have inconsistencies in color in your cake. And I took one of the suggestions on here and sprinkled some sugar on the sides of my pans so that the sides of the cake are a little carmel-y. I bake it at 330 degrees for at least an hour and then check it every ten minutes depending on how large my pan is. I just take it out when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Everyone who's tried my pound cake says it's one of the best they've ever had. Good luck!

this is outstanding, did reduce sugar to 2 1/2 cups, added 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 teas almond extract, 5 eggs, 1/2 teas salt ans 1/2 teas baking soda, 1/2 cup sour cream, baked for 75 minutes and it was perfect, lovely lovely flavor and texture, not too sweet, which we like since we don't like frostings or very sweet cakes...could dust with 10xxx sugar to make  it pretty, I served it with strawberries, it was excellent.....the key is to beat the sugar, butte,r and eggs for at least 5 minutes with a stand mixer...this recipe lends itself very nicely to modify according to taste, maple flavoring with finely chopped pecans come to mind in addition to the vanilla....

I have no need to ever look for another pound cake recipe.  This one is top notch!  I doubled the vanilla and lemon extract and did end up cooking for just over an hour....was more like 70mins. Oh and I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used 1 tblsp of lemon juice and topped it up with  2%milk to make a cup.  Let that sit for 10 minutes and add to recipe in place of buttermilk. Served with real whip cream and sliced strawberries sprinkled with a little sugar...Yummy.

This is the perfect pound cake!  Crust is slightly chewy and does not flake off when sliced like sour cream pound cake does.  I omitted the lemon extract as I personally do not like its flavor.  Baked in two large loaf pans and got 22 generous servings out of them. I prefer making pound cakes in loaf pans because you get flat slices, and the berries don't slide off!  After I buttered my pans, I sprinkled them generously with granulated sugar instead of flour.  The loaves slipped out of pans easily, and the sugar made the outside edges of the loaves slightly crispy which I loved.  Will never make sour cream pound cake again!

I thought I'd try this for a change but found the cake dry on the inside and the crust was very crunchy.  Also, the cake stuck to my pan so much that I couldn't get it out 10 minutes after it came out of the oven despite having greased the pan (and not after 30 minutes either).  I consider myself a very experienced baker but this recipe did not do it for me.

I separated the egg yolks/whites.  Beat whites till stiff then placed in large bowl. I added 1/2 cup sour cream, juice and zest from three lemons to wet ingredients. After egg yolks are mixed in one at a time I folded batter into beaten whites. Glaze while still warm with confectioner's sugar, juice & zest  from one lemon,touch of salt.  This will be your favorite cake! Wonderful texture and lemon taste.

THE BEST!  My whole family raved about this pound cake.  I baked it per the recipe in a bundt pan and it came out perfectly.

Taste was okay. It would have been better with cake flour. I gave this 3 stars because it was so-so. I'd make it again in a pinch but not my first choice of pound cake recipes.

Good cake, but I wouldn't call it a pound cake.  It was very light and fluffy.  It was good, just not pound cake-like.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a loaf pan, and topped w/a chocolate glaze.  Even though it wasn't what I was looking for, it didn't stop us from eating tons of it.  :)  I will maybe use this recipe when I want a nice, light and fluffy cake.

Not what I was expecting. It was good, but I guess I am just used to pound cakes being rather heavy. This was light. It almost burned, the time listed is too long! Stuck to pan despite care being taken, if making again I would line the pan. Making a glaze helped (2 cups confectioners sugar mixed with concentrated lemon juice until a runny consistency formed, put this on cake while it is still warm).

I was leaning more toward 3 stars but my picky husband loved this so I bumped it up to 4. I liked Barbara's Golden Pound Cake more (probably because I used 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk) and it was very moist.  This cake was a little dry for my tastes, but I prefer a moist cake while my husband likes they on the dry side, go figure!  The taste was nice and not overwhelming, and it looked nice.  I used a heart shaped nordic ware bundt pan and had some trouble with sticking issues but that is probably my fault for not preparing the pan well enough -- I just used baking spray. Thanks! Glad I found a pound cake my husband likes!

UPDATE 7/9/11: Since posting an earlier review, I made this again using KARLMALE's suggestions (see 1st review) of the lemon, cardamom & lemon glaze. WOW! Truly amazing! Guests can't quite identify the spice--even after the 2nd or 3rd slice! Don't skip the glaze.  . . . . Excellent! Since I wanted only a loaf, I halved this recipe. Worked great. 350 for 1 hour. Tender crumb with plenty of lift. This recipe could be easily adapted by using different flavorings.

I made this cake and while waiting for it to cool it fell. I used splenda and not sugar. Could this be it? It looked good coming out of the oven. Ayone know why this may have happen?

One word for this.... YUM! I made one slight change but; only because I had made my last cake with lemon flavor. I subbed almond extract for the lemon. It was delicious and moist.

Delicious pound cake.  Do not overmix and you have a creamy, soft and flavorful dessert!  I added another 1 tsp vanilla and substitued almond for the lemon flavoring and made it in a bundt pan to rave reviews.  Used it for strawberry shortcake.

This cake is fabulous! I had leftover buttermilk I wanted to use up so I selected this recipe, and I am so glad I did!  It was delicious and easy to make.  This is the closest I have ever come to my mother's pound cake and she wss a wonderful cook, so that is saying a lot for this recipe!  I will make this cake again and again.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was definitely homemade from scratch, it has a good taste, probably would have tasted better if I had the right cake pan and followed one of the reviewers advice on mixing it by spoon rather than the electric mixer. It still came out pretty good other wise.

Delicious cake! I used 2 cups of sugar instead of three and it was perfect. The first time I made the cake using three cups of sugar, it was too sweet. Two cups of sugar is perfect.

I baked this in a normal loaf pan for 50 mins. It appeared set & golden. I poked it & pressed it & it bounced back. However when I cut it (after it had cooled completely) it had a gooey middle. So for those wanting to do 1/2 the recipe & use a loaf pan, go ahead just be careful about ensuring it's thoroughly baked. My oven tends to be a bit screwy, though, in fair warning. 

1/2 half recipe makes a perfectly filled to the brim loaf, btw. Someone said they halved the recipe & thought it wasn't enough batter for a normal loaf pan. It's fine, though.

I used the recommendation of one of the reviewers & used a wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients. It took a little elbow grease but it was worth it, I think. My cake-- where it was fully baked was tender & moist. 

I think next time I'll use half a cup less sugar or so. I found it to be a little too sweet but not bad. For those with a big sweet tooth it will probably be great as is!

Also I used salted butter & left out the salt since the recipe didn't specify which kind of butter to use & lots of baking uses unsalted. I think that it was the way to go: it was neither too salty or not salty enough. Just normal & cake-like. 

Instead of lemon extract I used almond extract & doubled the vanilla. It had a lot of flavor. I might use a touch less almond next time though since pound cake tends to grow in flavor as it rests. 

And lastly, I used 2% milk with a teaspoon or so of red wine vinegar to make buttermilk.

We loved it!

I am sure this recipe is exceptional as written so I am rating it as a 5. I did make some substitutions for the benefit of my family. I used one cup Splenda for baking, one cup each white and brown sugar. I also used one cup of whole wheat flour and two cups of white flour, real lemon juice and zest and farm fresh eggs. Baked at 325 degrees for 75 minutes and came out very nice.

I followed this recipe exactly.  The cake came out so dry as to almost be inedible.  I hope it was just a matter of needing to bake maybe 60 minutes instead of 90.  I should have checked it way earlier, but got sidetracked.

I love this recipe! This pound cake is wonderfully moist all by itself and does not require any toppings. I leave out the lemon extract and must be very careful with the baking time - in my mother's oven it was done in just over an hour.

I have to say this is the best pound cake recipe I've tried!  The only change I made was minor.  I use almond flavoring instead of lemon.  Oh, and for some reason, it only takes about an hour in my oven for the cake to bake but I'm careful not to open the oven until after an hour has passed.  I can't tell you how many requests I get for this cake!  No frosting is ever needed; I usually serve the cake with fresh fruit and whipped cream but it is equally delicious all by itself.  Thank you so much Cathy for this wonderful recipe!

Very flavorful and moist.  I ended up using a teaspoon of vanilla, the juice of two small lemons and their zest.  I planned on putting a powdered sugar lemon glaze on it, but I couldn't get the darn thing out of my very well-greased, nonstick bundt pan.  It still tastes good, and we are making due nicely with the sad looking thing.  Next time I'm going to use the two-piece tube pan to make sure I can get it out.  My husband also has had success with dusting the pan with sugar after he greases it.  Makes a nice and crispy crust on the outside.

I used half brown sugar, as others suggested, and followed the rest exactly. Unfortunately, mine came out a bit dry and stuck to the pan quite a bit. It was really hard to get it out. I made a lemon glaze with lemon juice, water and sugar heated together, and poured over the warm cake, after I poked holes into it to make it more moist. Still was dry! Some loved it, and others thought it was just okay. I would have given it 3 stars, but because I changed the brown sugar a bit, I thought I'd give it 4 to be fair, as I am supposed to rate the recipe posted, and not my modifications. :)
thanks for sharing!

If I could give this more than five stars, I would!  It was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception.  I used butter flavor instead of the lemon.  My husband doesn't like lemon, and I didn't want to take the chance of the lemon standing out too much. It was my first ever attempt at a pound cake from scratch.  It was so easy and delicious!  I will definitely make this again...soon! We ate it plain, no whipped cream, no fruit, nothing.  And I didn't miss any of it! Moist and full of flavor!

This is a wonderful recipe which always produces excellent results.  My only change was to use a tablespoon of homemade vanilla extract and not use the lemon extract - simply a personal preference.  This cake also freezes well.

Scrumptious and lip smacking good.   The cake bakes up with a delightful crisp sugar crust on top. I threw in some blueberries on one half and it came out perfect as well.  Excellent basic pound cake recipe.

Kind of bland. I followed exactly except used real lemon/zest like others said. Probably won't make again.

This is the same recipe I've made for years, using almond extract instead of the lemon.  My recipe calls for separating the eggs, beating the egg whites to stiff peaks and foldiing them into the mixture.  I thought this would be easier (and it was) but more dense than the other method.  If you like your cake to raise higher and be more tender, try my way.  Great flavor!

Was very impressed with this recipe and my first time making a pound cake!  I halfed the recipe and made it in a glass loaf pan and it turned out beautifully! I will definately make this again. I might add a little extra lemon extract next time.  It would be good with some raspberry or strawberry swirled in it too.

Wonderful, moist, dense poundcake!  Didn't have any lemon extract so I used the juice and zest of 1 lemon- as someone else suggested.  I also used a cup of powdered sugar and juice of 1/2 a lemon to make a glaze.  Very yummy!  My entire family is wanted me to make it again!  Thanks Cathy for a great cake!

For those of you who find this cake turning too hard after refrigerating (like I did), here's the way to restore the cake's tenderness: microwave a slice for 20-25 seconds. The cake will taste as if it is fresh from the oven! This recipe produces a dense, moist cake that can be wrapped up in plastic wrap and kept for more than a week in the fridge - VERY handy in busy school days.

Made half and baked it in a loaf pan. Didn't have any lemon extract so used only vanilla. Did dust the loaf pan with sugar and was very happy with the crunchy crust.

I just tried this recipe last night and it was AWWWEEESOME!  I am not much of a cook, but I love to attempt at baking around the holidays.  This cake turned out very moist and soft.  I am so thankful that my family can finally eat something I baked!! I must add that I did not need to bake it for as long as the recipe called for.  I baked it around 1 hour and 10 minutes or so.

very good moist cake. i doubled the vanilla & lemon flavorings. only baked it one hour,dusted with powdered sugar & it looked beautiful. ovens vary but no pound cake needs to bake for 1 1/2 hrs. use the toothpick test for doneness.

My family and I aren't crazy about extremely sweet desserts, and this pound cake is just right for our taste.  Not overly sweet, tangy, very moist, and great by itself!  I've made this several times now, and anytime I mention making it, I get the thumbs up from the family.  Thanks Cathy!

I was looking for a Buttermilk pound cake recipe that tasted like my Grandmother's and this is it! I followed the recipe with the exception of I sifted my flour.  Next time I will grease my pan and then dust with flour my Pampered Chef Bundt pan is not fully seasoned and made me nervous coming out.  Other than that recipe is perfect I just dusted with powdered sugar instead of icing. It is a keeper thanks for sharing.

I baked this cake today and I was apprehensive about the cooking time. I felt that 90 minutes was excessive. I decided to cook for 45 minutes. I actually wished I had taken it out about 40 minutes. I used my Nordic Anniversary Bundt pan. I believe that a 9-inch tube pan is wrong for this recipe. My pan holds 15 to 16 cups. I haven't tasted it yet but I did post a picture.

5-Star all the way.  Light lemon flavor/scent from the extract.  Made a lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze for the top.  Ours took just about the whole 90 minutes to start pulling away from the pan sides.

I did not care for this recipe. Other than subbing an extra tsp. of Vanilla for the Lemon, I followed the directions exactly. Not only did the cake completely stick to the inside of my pan and fall apart when I tried to get it out, what came out had absolutely no taste at all!

Very flavorful, moist buttermilk pound cake. I made this in a bundt pan. I chose to use lemon zest and real lemon juice (no extract). Thou the recipe calls for 3 cups of white sugar, the cake was not overly sweet which was great. The cake baked in 90 minutes. I finished off the pound cake with a glaze (one cup powdered confectioner's sugar and fresh lemon juice) drizzled over the cake. This is one of the best pound cakes I've come across. It is a very moist cake with a golden brown crumb. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My husband loves this recipe! He doesn't have the sweet tooth that I have, but if I make this, it is gone in a day.  I bake in 2 loaf pans (I don't have a bundt pan) for 70 minutes and leave out the lemon extract (I don't have that around the house either!).  It always turns out great!

Very nice cake, but I gave it a 4 because I made a couple changes to meet my needs.  I wanted to serve strawberries over pound cake for Easter dessert, but the berries did not look appealing.  So, I took KARLMALE's idea and used cardamom and the zest of one orange (I think the flavors of orange and cardamom are heavenly, but did not want the orange flavor to be too overpowering - the zest only was perfect!), and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla (there would have been that 1/2 tsp left in the bottle, and I think that tad extra added some depth of flavor).  I also added 1/2 sour cream, based on other reviewers mentioning it was a little on the dry side.  It was a tad too sweet for my taste, although my family thought it was fine (and I did not use a glaze - just a light sprinkle of powdered sugar), so I will use 1/2 c less sugar next time.  It was lighter, not as dense, as pound cakes I have had in the past, which was actually a nice change.  When I do want a denser pound cake, I will try one less egg (or fewer egg whites - I'll have to do some studying on that).  All in all, it was a successful Easter dessert.  Thanks Cathy!

This is a tender pound cake, but I felt like it needed double the extract for flavor.  I whipped the butter with sugar and then slowly beat in the eggs to incorporate air and yield a softer cake.

My family seemed to like this, but I wasn't that impressed.  It was had a nice crumb and texture, rose nicely, etc, but was lacking something.  My main complaint was that it tasted "eggy"--almost like a sponge cake taste.  Since the eggs are the main leavening agent, maybe that's why?  I added some semi-sweet chocolate ganache that I drizzled on top.  It was pretty, but not a show stopper--especially in flavor.

I followed the recipe, but my cake was so dry.  The outside was too crunchy and the inside was dry.  The flavor was good so I gave it two stars, but no one liked it because of the dryness.  I will not be making this again.

Really nice pound cake.  I didn't have lemon extract so I followed one review and did it with juice from a fresh lemon and zest.  Then I finished it off with a lemon glaze (confection sugar with lemon juice).

Yummy!!! I love this pound cake. I have made it many times and the family loves it. My brother keeps asking em to make it so he can freeze slices of the cake and eat it frozen as his dessert. I did increase the vanilla to 2 tsp and also used 1 lemon (juice and zest) instead of the extract.  I think that this would also be just as good using an orange and orange zest. Might try it next time.

This was SO yummy and moist and rich! I halved the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan. Took nearly the entire 90 minutes to cook. I covered the pan tightly with foil after I took it out of the oven, left it this way for a good 20 minutes to help 'steam' the loaf...would add lemon zest next time and make a glaze, too. This was delicious with thawed blueberries & their juices spooned on top of each slice. I only wish I had whipped cream as that would have totally made the dessert!

Really nice texture and taste.  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups as I thought 3 would be too sweet, can't tell the difference.  I baked mine in a bundt pan and it was done in 57 minutes, edges were brown and center came out clean with a toothpick. If anyone's cake is dry it is from the cooking length, 90 minutes is way too long.

Delicious!! Great recipe! I made it almost exactly as-is and divided the batter between two loaf pans, yum! I read all of the most helpful reviews first, but decided against making any substantial changes. My son and I are big fans of Starbucks' iced lemon pound cake and I wanted to see if I could emulate it. Consequently, I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon each of the vanilla and lemon extracts. I love the lemon flavoring so next time I will probably add even more extract and some fresh lemon juice! I did follow the advice of another reviewer and dusted the pan lightly with powdered sugar after greasing. This created a great thin crust and helped the cake fall right out of the pan. The only other thing I did following a review was to brush on a thin icing made from powdered sugar, lemon juice, and a little water, mixed to a glue-like consistency. This made the perfect cake even better in my opinion. However, my son (he's 4) still liked Starbucks' better because of the thick icing, so next time I'll make my icing thicker and apply numerous layers of it for him. This is a fabulous pound cake that is good from the start, but gets even better, if that's even possible, and more moist after a couple of days. I will be using this recipe for my pound cake for years to come, just as is. All those that try to alter ingredients so much lose the true essence of the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I also halved this recipe and made it in a loaf. Didn't have lemon extract so I added a bit of lemon juice. This loaf turned out dense and delicious! Perfectly moist on top!

Excellent cake. It was wonderful. We ate the whole thing (none had to be thrown out). I only used 5 eggs because I could not imagine putting six eggs in a cake, and it was still dense and moist. I made my own buttermilk with lemon juice because I didn't have any, and it worked great. I added plenty of lemon, vanilla, and a bit of almond flavor to the cake. I also only used about 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and it was sweet enough. It was great plain with ice cream, but I also topped with penuche frosting. Edit to add: This cake is amazing! I made it for Thanksgiving. This time I bought real buttermilk and the cake was even better, in my opinion. I used fresh lemon juice as well as a little lemon and a generous amount of vanilla extract. Again, only used 5 eggs and 2 1/2 cups of sugar. The cake was dense, moist, and delicious!

Today I made pound cake for the second time using this recipe, and I succeeded! Since I worried this time might turn out to be a failure again, I halved the recipe and made it into two smaller loaves. They were done in 45 min. I guess the mistake I did in my first attempt was overbeating the batter; therefore, air was beaten out. The end product was a "cake" that had a solid center. But, the cakes turned out be dense and moist this time--just the way pound cake is supposed to be. Worrying about overbeating the batter again, I mixed in the dry ingredients and soured milk by hand instead. Yet, I noticed there're some tiny holes in the cakes--too much air this time (LOL)? I guess in the future, I'll jiggle the pans of batter before putting them into the oven. Also, I decreased sugar to 1-1/4 cups for half the recipe. (I used 2-1/3 cups for the entire recipe.) And it had the right sweetness. I also doubled the vanilla and added 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon for half the recipe. Cinnamon was really mild, but it did help perk up the flavor. This recipe deserves five stars; I failed the first time due to my own fault. Once I understand the nature of making pound and butter cakes, chances of failure decrease greatly. I'll definitely use this recipe again for pound cake!

This is the best result I've gotten with a pound cake recipe.  I used 2 teaspoons almond extract in place of the lemon and added a box of vanilla instant pudding.  Cake was done right at 70 minutes.  Very moist.  Served with strawberries and whipped cream.  The cake got rave reviews from my dinner guests.

Great recipe, created a nice, thick cake. To cut back on the fat I substituted 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 applesauce. I also used lemon juice and zest instead of extract and added 1 tsp cardamom.

This is an excellent recipe.  The only amendment I made was to reduce the sugar from 3 cups to 2 and a half cup.  I still think that I can reduce it by a quarter cup.  Will try that the next time I use this recipe.  I also omitted lemon extract I increase vanilla extract to 1 tablespoon.

This pound cake is delicious!  I made a couple of changes as suggested by another cook and added almond extract rather than lemon extract and I also added 2 ounces cream cheese.  I have been married 35 years and this is my second attempt at trying to baka a pound cake.  The first attempt was as as newly wed following the recipe of a dear aunt who gave me a tube pan as a wedding gift with her favorite pound cake recipe that was made with a "dozen" eggs.  It was a disaster and I guess I thought that pound cakes were to be produced only by the "over the hill" cooks!  Perhaps now that I am 56, I qualify as an "over the hill" cook and with this recipe, I can produce a cake equally a good as my Aunt Mary did back in 1972!  Thanks Cathy for the fabulous recipe!!!

I always test my Allrecipes recipes on my co-workers because they are so honest and this was a hit! It was really moist and had a really good flavor.  Like some of the other reviewers I thought the sugar was going to make the cake too sweet but it was not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be.  My husband loved it as did the picky 21 month old!  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used the juice of one lemon instead of the lemon extract and although it came out beautifully, it didn't taste as good as it looked.  I think the buttermilk just didn't give it a good aroma, like Sara Lee's or other recipes which didn't use buttermilk.  I think I'll stick to the regular pound cake recipe.

I have tried many poundcake recipes and this is one of the best.  Extremely easy, quick mixing instructions.  Made
a beautifully, high pound cake.  I used
2 tsp. of vanilla in this recipe -- no
lemon.  Try it!

This is now my go-to recipe. I follow it exactly and every single time (at least 15 times by now) I end up with an incredibly moist, flavorful, perfect pound cake. I find it gets better with a day or two of aging so if I need the cake on a Saturday I try to make it on Wednesday night, Thursday at the latest. Also, I (liberally!) butter and sugar my bundt pan; the crust is amazing! Often I'll serve this with chopped strawberries and vanilla yogurt (combined.) Perfect!

I've made this delious pound cake 3 times and I never have anything left to toss out like other box cakes. Same great taste each time. Only difference is I had to decrease my baking time in order to keep from drying it out too much.

This is fantastic and light. However I added a lemon glaze that gives another layer of flavor and of course another layer of calories.

1 cup powdered sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons milk

Nice dense pound cake. I followed exactly and it has nice flavor. I baked in the tube pan recommended and it only took 1 hour and fifteen minutes. Watch closely.

So I make my world famous banana cake and I have quite a bit of buttermilk leftover. I do a simple search on this site and came across this recipe. I never looked at the ratings and decided I am making it. I did not have a tube pan so I used a bundt cake pan instead. It did not make any difference. It came out very well and I did not tweak anything. I made some cream cheese icing and added lemon extract and just a little lemon peel to drizzle over it.

This is a delicious, moist poundcake with great texture.  It tastes like an old fashion pound cake, which is just the way I like cake to taste.   I only had self-rising flour on hand but I used it anway.  I still added the baking soda.  I don't see that it made a difference.  The next time I make it I will use all purpose flour.  I will also try it with cake flour to see what the difference in texture will be.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Made this cake with a few modifications suggested by others well it goes a little like this the cake turned out beautifully as you can see from the photo.  Have tried other recipes for pound cakes with very little success mostly they were too heavy or did not bake well.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Giving a 4 stars cause the recipe is not completely accurate! 
I've tried the recipe last weekend! Few adjustments: a) Baking time 60 mins instead of 90, b) added extra half cup of buttermilk instead just 1 cup. 
Conclusion: It turned out to be extremely nice and tasty.
The texture was moist and soft! I gave some to coworkers and family members, they all gave 5 stars on it! 
I'm very happy with the result!

My new, favorite Buttermilk Pound Cake recipe!  I make this in the rose shaped, Nordicware pan.  The outside is nice and crisp but the inside is nice and moist.  I don't change anything in the recipe.

I always reduce sugar when baking as I find that to my taste, 99% of recipes yield overly sweet results. I only had to decrease sugar by 1/2C this time. I added 1 lemon zest to enhance the flavour and added more than 1 tsp of lemon juice (I just added juice of 1 lemon). It turned out really great! I already made this several times and my favourite way to bake this is in mini loaf pans. I can get 12 mini loaves out of this recipe and baked it for approx 55 to 58 minutes.

I love this cake.  It's been a staple of mine for a few years.  It's simple and to the point.  Sometimes I do it just like the recipes reads and sometimes I add real lemon juice and no vanilla.  I like lemon! :)  Then an old school lemon glaze. (Stick of butter creamed with about a pound of powdered sugar and lemon juice from a lemon.  Watch the seeds.!)  It is always GONE either way and the recipe is always in demand.

Excellent and moist. Followed the suggestions of several reviewers and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla and the zest and juice of one lemon instead of the lemon extract. The lemon really brightened the flavor. Almost overflowed my bundt pan (a standard sized pan) it rose so much during baking. But ended up light in texture. Definitely keeping this recipe. Served it with strawberries macerated with sugar, a bit of lemon juice, and mint. Delicious!

Nice pound cake, nice and dense. Awesome flavor of the lemon. I made no changes to this cake except to use low fat buttermilk. It was great served with Simple Orange Glaze from this site drizzled on top. Thanks!

delicious! this made enough for me to make a bundt and a round pound cake. I think 90 min is about 15 min too long for cooking time.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and doubled the vanilla and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It was moist with a wonderful flavor and a flaky crust.  Perfect pound cake!

This was an easy recipe to follow. Although, the cake looked lovely but crust came out too hard :(. I saw another review that this could have been due to the long cook time..So I'll try again and reduce cook time to an hour..But overall I enjoyed baking this cake...Practice makes Perfect!!!

This is a good tasting cake. But, mine was a little dry with a hard outer crust. I think the cooking time is way off like some of the other reviewers have suggested. I just hate it when you present a cake that isn't perfect. :(  I will try it again and check the cake after an hour.

I made this tonight after dinner and it turned out pretty good. I split it between 2 loaf pans as I don't have a bundt pan. I baked it for about an hour and 15 min. I substituted 3 tsp of lemon juice for the lemon extract. It had a wonderful flavor. The density wasn't quite right for a pound cake, so I will take the advice given to omit one egg white from the 6 eggs next time. This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent, quick easy pound cake recipe! Made it according to the recipe - except a little less lemon. (I was making it to cut up for chocolate fondue) Firm but moist. Baked in a (deep) bundt pan for about 1 hr 40 min. Delish!!

I used a bundt pan instead of a tube pan and maybe that was not a good choice. The cake rose over the sides and was hard to get out. Other than that, the cake taste great and was very moist.

I found the original recipe too bland. The second time I doubled the vanilla & lemon extracts and it was perfect- moist, perfect density, fine crumb, lovely! Made it again last night and added 3 tablespoons of key lime juice in addition to the extracts and it was awesome- fresh lime flavor, tangy, with still that PERFECT texture. Great basic recipe to play with and very pleased with the results.

Good recipe with some modifications.  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and added a bit more butter (1/2 stick).  It came out very moist.  Although I still think it was a little too sweet, so next time I'll try 1.5 cups of sugar.  I also followed another member's idea of leaving out the egg white in one of the eggs to make it more dense-it worked!  Hubby and son loved it. My cake never separated from my loaf pan so I learned from someone that you can put a strip of parchment paper and it should come out easily.

Delicious cake, moist and flavorful. I followed the instructions exactly but found that it took only 70 minutes to cook in my gas oven. Watch it carefully to avoid overcooking. (Nothing worse than a dry pound cake door stop.) A definite keeper!

What a wonderful cake!  I thought it was just out of this world!! Simple to put together and came out beautiful.  There is just the two of us, so it lasted quite a long time, I'd placed it in a "lock & lock" container and the last piece was just as good as the first.  The last couple of nights I put fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream on top.  Delightful to say the least.  I can see making this often and sharing with our foodie friends.  Thanks!

I had some spoiled milk I wanted to use, so this worked out perfectly! Nice and moist, does not need icing or anything, but I drizzled chocolate over mine and served it with strawberries. It freezes well, and tastes fine just reheated in the microwave...

This being my first time making a pound cake i was kinda clueless as to what it should or shouldn't be like.  It turned out very well- I believe I overcooked i though.  Its very delicious eaten plain with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! It takes quite alot of ingredients and was very dense! I found it very sweet. So i'd very much like to know if theres a way to de-sweeten it!?  Overall,I think i'd make it again (not too often because it takes tons of eggs and TONS of sugar), and everyone enjoyed it!

This is a good Pound Cake recipe.  I tried it while looking for recipes to use up Buttermilk.  I served it with Pineapple Sherbet, also on allrecipes.

I followed this almost exactly, but halved the recipe and baked one 4x9 loaf. It took about 70 minutes to cook instead of 90.  I also followed another person's suggestion and used lemon zest with a splash of lemon juice.  This pound cake was perfection. So much so that it's the first review I've ever made of a recipe.

This has got to be the best pound cake I've ever made! I used cake flour and folded in the whipped egg whites. Moist and delicious and the most tender crumb. I baked two 9" rounds from the recipe and decorated with whipped cream cheese frosting and modeling chocolate. So good!

I exchanged baking powder for the baking soda and it came out perfect. My husband loves this cake. It's good with fruit and/or whipped cream, too. I didn't have lemon extract, so I used almond extract.

this was my first time baking a pound cake, and I loved it.  I creamed the butter and sugar together in my stand mixer for 5 minutes until it was nice and fluffy.  I took the advice of some of the reviews and replaced the lemon extract with the zest and juice of one lemon, it gives the cake such a bright flavor.  I made an icing with powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice and drizzled over the top.  Delicious!

The cake had a good taste. But it was way too heavy and thick!! Perhaps more baking soda or adding baking powder would have made it better.

I've used this recipe so many times I've committed it to memory.  I use Madagascar vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract, and about 1/4 cup more sugar to make the crust extra thick and chewy (like a sugar cookie).  I have found that the trick is to leave that oven door closed the full baking time.  It's been EXCELLENT!

This was delicious!  I scaled in half and baked in a loaf pan.  Used fresh meyer lemon juice instead of extract.  Sprinkled top with sugar before baking and it gave it a nice crunch.  You will bake for much less time (50 min. or so) if scaling down.  I would watch carefully even if making the whole recipe as 90 min. seems like a long baking time for this cake.  Served with chopped mango and strawberrries and a dollop of whipped cream.  This is a perfect Spring dessert.  I plan to serve it after Easter dinner.

THE BEST POUNDCAKE EVER! I made a few adjustments though. I added 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk, used 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of pure lemon juice. Once out of the oven (from another members suggestion), I covered the cake with a glaze made with powdered sugar and lemon juice. Delicious and moist!

Yum. I used the large fresh lemon and lemon juice, and every thing else the same. I baked it in two 8 inch cake pans for 60 min. Then sliced it into a Tort form with pastry cream from this site and whipped cream cheese frosting. That was rich. lol.  Up date. December 20 th '09' I put 2 cups of frozen blueberry's in the batter. YUM!

I've made better pound cakes off this site so I'm giving this 4/5 stars.  It tasted good, nothing spectacular.  Definitely, if I made it again I wouldn't add lemon extract.  The lemon extract made the whole cake taste a bit fake.  I would have rather doubled the vanilla extract, which I may do next time if I try this again!   Though, for the purpose that I made it for it was fine.  I used a 9 by 13 pan, cooked for about 45 minutes, and frosted it with some buttercream and topped with fresh fruit in a flag motif.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made this for my father's day dessert & it turned out amazing. I did a couple of things differently but not anything that really changed the recipe. Instead of lemon extract I juiced a whole lemon & added the zest & I added my yolks & whites seperately because I always whip my whites stiff & fold them in at the end when I make a cake. It just gives a lighter texture which I thought would be great for a pound cake. It definitely has a lemon flavor so don't drizzle w/ anything that you wouldn't want to taste w/ that. Wonderful!

Absolutely perfect!  We had originally tried making a Martha Stewart recipe which sadly disappointed us.  This recipe was exactly what we were looking for - a nice dense pound cake which we glazed with a dessert wine reduction (we used Beringer's 2005 Nightingale Semillon/Sauvignon Blanc).  We make it in a bundt pan and it took all 90 minutes.  I will make this one again.

Fantastic cake! Mine took about 80 minutes to bake. I glazed it with a mixture of Bailey's and coffee. I used Crisco shortening to grease the Bundt pan. It did stick some; I will both grease AND flour the pan next time as I do with my other pound cake recipes and I feel this will help greatly.

I actually had to give this to my sister, as I was sure I'd eat the whole thing!  Followed KarlMale's suggestions, and the common ones: 5 eggs, 2.5 cups sugar, upped buttermilk to 1 1/8 cup, used zest and juice from a real lemon, 2 tsp vanilla, 1.25 tsp cardamom.  And, reduced flour to 2.75 cups. Baked for 70 minutes.   Topped with Karlmale's suggested glaze.  It's freakin' incredible!!!  If you're on a diet, DO NOT MAKE THIS, It's DANGEROUS!  *(tatiana hisel's suggestions also sound divine... I'd love to try it her way, as well!)*

I made the recipe as directed except used almond extract in place of the lemon and I added a bit of lemon juice as well. The cake cooked for the entire 90 minutes, I was scared it would fall so I barely opened the over the whole time. I had a very hard time getting the cake out of my bundt pan even though I had buttered it well. At first I thought the cake was overdone, it was a little bit darker than I expected. It ended up tasting great, a little crispy on the outside and perfect in the middle. I made a glaze of lemon juice, cream, and powdered sugar but it really didn't need anything. The only thing I may try next time is cutting back the cooking time 10-15 minutes. Thanks!

Exceptional recipe. I followed the recommendation of adding 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I made it for christmas dinner and it was a big hit, made 2 more 2 days later.  Moist, great flavor, very easy to make.

Wonderful.  I made a couple of changes:  first, because I wanted to give two gifts of pound cake, I filled two (smallish) loaf pans.  In addition, I substituted almond flavoring for the lemon.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (full complement of eggs!)  To compensate for the smaller pans, I reduced the baking time to an hour and fifteen minutes.  I did have a bit of trouble getting the cakes out of the pans, but with some cutting around the perimeter, some pounding, and some flexing of the pans, I was able to extract them with minimal damage.  I had used spray oil, rather than butter, to grease the pans.  They look and smell terrific ... and judging by the crumbs that were sacrificed in the removal process, they seem to taste pretty good, too!  Thanks!

Delicious recipe, reminded me a lot of my mother's recipe I used to bake as a teenager and haven't made a great pound cake like this in at least 25 years. Thank you for posting your recipe. My oven runs a bit hot, so I had to bake a second batter and kept a closer look after an hour. This has become my father's favorite pound cake; don't tell my mom :)

This came out so light and fluffy. It didn't need any frosting a simple syrup of fresh strawberries with a bit of sugar and it is delicious.

Man, do I love pound cake!  This was fantastic!!  Ate it plain, ate it with berries, ate it with ice cream ... it was great with everything!  Used fresh lemon juice because I didn't have any extract, and I dusted the bottom of my bundt pan with sugar to get a crusty top.  Definitely recommended.

I baked this cake in anticipation of my brother's visit with us not seeing each other for nearly 3 years. We love sitting over a slice of pound cake and a steaming cup of coffee as we catch up on each others' news.  After he left, he called and said "By the way, Sis, that was some of the best pound cake since Gramma's. Sure would like that recipe"!  Rich, full-bodied, great texture. Didn't have lemon flavoring so used one tsp. coconut flavoring and it was gone in 1 1/2 days. Nuff said!  Many, many thanks.

This one is a definite winner! It's the best pound cake I've ever baked. AND it's scrumptious. Friends and family put this one on the top of their request lists. This is one recipe I will pass on to my daughters and their children.

This pound cake was excellent.  I accidentally ran out of lemon extract so I could only add 1/2 tsp. So I added a full teaspoon of almond extract and the tsp. of vanilla.  My family loved this flavour!  I am not sure what happened for some people to have this turn out as light, my seemed the right texture weight for a pound cake.  I baked this cake for 70 minutes as suggested by other reviews.  This is definitely a cake I plan on making many times.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used a little more lemon extract than vanilla because my family tends to like lemon more.  I definitely reduced the cooking time because I felt that 90 minutes was too long and would dry out the cake.  I let the cake cook for an hour (a resonable amount of time for a pound cake) before I tested it and the cake was probably done in about 70 minutes.  The finished cake was quite moist and received rave reviews from my family.

I used 2 tsp lemon extract, 1 tsp orange extract, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. The flavor is good, but it is not moist enough. I found it a little dry for my taste.

It was by far the best pound cake I've cooked, very moist, "DELICIOUS" Rates 100 :) Quoting my husband "This is A KEEPER", he suggested sprinkling with cinnamon/sugar on top after baking.
Co-workers LOVE THIS. Have this at top of my Pound Cake recipes.

a helpeful hint i learned- if you don't have buttermilk, you can mix a cup of milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice for every cup of buttermilk. I learned this on cooking light magazine.

This reminds me of the bundt cakes at the store, same texture, size and eye appeal; with one BIG difference, it tastes HOMEMADE, definately not a traditional poundcake, but then again, sometimes pound cakes are sooo overrated! WTG, a chef in the making. I served it warm with no icing, sliced fresh strawberries and whipped cream. DELICIOUS!

I have made this cake for years and have always made the lemon and cardamom  suggestion by reviewer karlmale in 2001.  Add juice and zest of 1 large lemon - which is about 1/4 c juice,  2 teaspoons vanilla, 1-1/2 tsp cardamom. The only thing I do different is my glaze is 1/2 c powder sugar, 2Tbs cream, 1/4 tsp lemon extract and 1/4 tsp vanilla. Sometimes I just dust with powdered sugar. It has the absolutely best flavor. I made it today and decided to add a rating and review.

This recipe is the best I've ever used to make pound cake. I've made it several times, following the recipe exactly and also changing it up by using all vanilla extract instead of the lemon. Wonderful flavor, nice crumb, soft texture; you really can't go wrong with this one!

The grain of this pound cake is exactly what you would want it to be, small and dense.  Mine turned out looking exactly like the one in the photo.  I think it was a little dry, but perfect for any kind of topping - fruit, ice cream, whipped cream, etc.  We ate it plain tonight.  I suspect it will get moister upon sitting, so maybe tomorrow it will be perfect.  Next time I make it I think I will double the vanilla and leave out the lemon extract.

I made this recipe exactly as printed with only one exception: I took a cue from others and increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons to offset the lemon extract.  The instructions forgot to mention to begin and end with the flour mixture, but aside from that, no problems. Using a mixer may well result in a less-than-moist cake, and you don't really need to get mechanical with it unless you have physical limitations. If you do, I recommend using your lowest speed only for the minimum time it takes to fully blend.

I used this recipe to fill a lamb mold for my granddaughter's first birthday. It filled the mold plus a medium loaf pan. The loaf pan baked for 1 hour while the mold went for 1 hour 15 minutes. 

It's an excellent recipe. Using a spoon to cream and mix the ingredients resulted in a moist, delicate-for-pound cake.  If you want to add your own touches, feel free. but if you're just afraid of a dry product, try using good technique before messing with adding things like cream cheese or sour cream.   Measure the flour correctly, along with the buttermilk and don't over-mix. Adding a lot of extra moisture and fat changes the final outcome from a classic pound cake to something different. 

In the future I might try using lemon juice and/or zest rather than extract, or almond extract instead of vanilla.  I wanted to fairly rate the recipe, so using the extract seemed only right.

Love this recipe!!!! Since my 10 years of marriage my mother-in-law has always made pound cake for the entire family. Pound cake is the only cake my husband and his brother will eat...VERY CRITICAL food eaters. Because of this recipe my entire family has passed the torch over to me!!! I only tweeted the temperature so it will be nice and moist inside with the nice slight crisp on the outer layer. Bless you so much for sharing!!

This was just what I expect in a pound cake.  The recipe follows a formula my long departed great grandmother-in-law used to use...which I couldn't remember.    It is rich, sweet, and heavy, as a pound  cake should be.  A caveat:  Know your oven!  My cake was finished after about 75 minutes.

Wow! I made this cake last night. It was super good. Im having it now with my morning coffee. Its not overly sweet, it is just perfect. I sprinkled sugar on the pan after i creased it which made a crusty outer layer to the cake which was my favorite part. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I followed it to the tee expect I used 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice instead of extract. Thank you!!

This cake was fantastic! I made it exactly as the recipe outlines. I have a standing mixer, so I screamed the butter, sugar eggs with extracts for about 15 mins at high speed. Then, I added flour and buttermilk alternating at low speed. The cake came out light and fluffy, not dense at all. The only thing I would change next time is to use less lemon extract. I think a 1/4-1/2 tsp would be just fine and not overpower.

This was fabulous!  I had no lemon extract, so I used fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I am from the South, and pound cake is important.  I have found the perfect recipe.  Good enough to serve to my mother!  I will make it for my family's dessert tomorrow for our Sunday dinner.

This is a great recipe! As it says it can be used alone or as a base for many toppings such as a quick carmel pour over or with strawberries.  I followed the recipe exactly and came out with a golden moist cake.  I will be making this cake for many years to come.

I like using up extra buttermilk in cornbread or deserts.  This pound cake recipe is wonderful.   The texture is perfect.  I made it exactly as written and enjoyed the light lemony flavor.  It is sweet, but, not too sweet and I am sure any topping of fruit would make a wonderful desert.  I baked this in an angel food cake pan and it did take a bit longer to bake, but, it makes several servings.  I enjoyed my serving with a nice hot cup of tea.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my one and only recipe for pound cake. I absolutely love this. I follow the recipe exactly as written, no changes at all. I don't think it's fair to change an original recipe then rate it. How much sense does that make? Thank you for a great recipe!

I LOVE this pound cake!  I've made it twice (both times without lemon extract sadly, and I know the cake would have benefited from it) and my only real complaint is that it is a little on the dry/crumbly side.  However, it made a perfect base for other things--the first time I made strawberry shortcake with homemade strawberry sauce, and the second time I made faux "grilled cheese sandwiches" with orangesicle frosting, and it worked perfectly as a base for both items.  I halved the recipe both times and made it in a 9x5 loaf pan, and it takes about 1 hour 15 minutes at 325 degrees.

This is a very good recipe.  I cut back on the sugar and found it not being as sweet as I prefer.  I will go what the author stated initially..  I did increase the vanilla flavoring as I love vanilla.  Also, I baked it only 1Hr10 minutes.  That was plenty.

This is one of my favorite pound cake recipes. It has a very tender crumb and is easy to pull together. I have used several different glazes on this and it's also the base for my Punchbowl Cakes.

Like another reviewer, I changed the quantity to 6 to split this recipe in half. I then made it in a 9 x 5.5 glass loaf pan. After 50 minutes at 325, the center wasn't done but it was nicely browned. I covered it with foil and baked it another 10 minutes, for a total of 1 hour. It is delicious with a nice crust. I only used vanilla and it has a wonderful flavor. We love it and will use it for strawberry shortcake!

This is superb! Crispy outside, fine crumb, very moist. I used two loaf panes lined with parchment. Baking time was the full 90 mins. For a lemon version, replace the buttermilk with milk and lemon combined to equal one cup. I used 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup lemon thinking I would add more lemon taste with a glaze. Next time I'll try 2/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup lemon because the cake is too yummy for extras like glaze or frosting. Really!

This recipe is between 3-4 stars.  I followed the ingredients as listed, but the batter is very very runny, so I had to add another 1/4 cup of flour.  I also cut down the sugar to 2 1/4 cups, still on the the sweet side.  The cake is too "poundy".  The flavor was good.

I made this cake true to the recipe. I never looked at the cake after 90 minutes of baking because it says "do not open the oven door until after one hour".  This cake was dry and crusty.  Now, maybe it's because I have a high end 36" gas range?  I did not use the convection feature. It was so adhered to my Teflon coated, well oiled and floured bundt pan I practically had to chisel it out.  If I make another one I will take it out immediately.

Wonderful pound cake.  I didn't have any lemon flavoring so I used 2 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp almond flavoring.  I also added 8 oz. sour cream. It was so moist.

I love the moist texture. I used the juice of one lemon, since I didn't have lemon extract.  I'm glad that I heeded the advice of other reviewers and checked for doneness at 60 minutes; my cake was done after 70 minutes.  However,  it was a bit too sweet for my liking. I will make this again, but with less sugar.

I made this recipe last night and it was FANTASTIC!!! I had some left over buttermilk and came across this recipe...and I'm so happy I tried it! Its moist....sweet...goodness. I will probably pair it up with some lemon glaze (Giadas lemon glaze for her lemon cookies). I will definitely be making this again.

This turn out pretty good! I wish I would have read reviews first! I would have used real lemon, and zest. I also would have likely added 1/4 cup of sour cream since it was a little dry. That will turn out ok I think because I'll use it to make French toast for breakfast out of it. I poured some rhubarb syrup on it I made yesterday, so it was great still warm fresh out of the oven! I followed the instructions except I only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar, otherwise it was made as shown! I'll make it again with the few changes I listed. I know the zest will add a lot, and the sour cream should keep it moist enough! Still good cake, and the buttermilk added a nice flavor!

Tried it as written and it is a five star recipe!  Now, I tried it again with only 2 cups of sugar and real lemon juice and zest.  It was even better!  I also put a lemon juice and confectioners sugar glaze on top... to die for. Really excellent. I did not have any problems with the cake being dry. It tastes just like my mother's poundcake from when I was a little girl. Dense and buttery.

Like a lot of other folks, I adjusted the recipe to suit my taste.  I usually think there is too much sugar used, decreased to 2 cups. Used the zest and juice of one large lemon, and added half cup sour cream.
Got good reviews from my family.

Excellent in every way. Easy to follow instructions properly indicate how to put this cake together. It's moist and flavourful on it's own or would make a great base for many other desserts. Easy to customize this cake to your own liking too.

This is a tried and true recipe. I dabble with additional ingredients; including using sour cream or yogurt instead of buttermilk. I've also swapped vanilla extract for my homemade mint extract and added food coloring for a creme de menth pound cake. What can I say, you can't go wrong with the amounts of dry versus wet and playing around with the flavorings. I should have posted a revue long before this because it is a keeper and a staple in my recipe box.

I made this cake yesterday to try out my new KitchenAid mixer. It was a good cake but will have to say not as good as my old standby pound cake that I've made for many years. A little heavy for me but made up into a beautiful cake.

Can you say - OMG so yummy. I shared this out with friends in from Ireland and they were in love with it.
I did make a slight variation - used fresh lemon juice and zest from a whole lemon instead of extract, used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of reg. Great recipe. Will definitely be making this again.

This was really good.  Nice and sweet.  I didn't use lemon extract because I didn't have it but other than that I made it exactly as written and baked in a bundt pan.   I don't see this staying in the house too long!

I was under the impression this was just a pound cake, but it turns out it's a LEMON pound cake. That should be the name of it, because it taste like a lemon pound cake and it calls for lemon extract.  But it was still very good, but really was looking forward to just a plain butter pound cake. Which I thought it was. But thanks anyway... Next time I'll omit the lemon extract.

Hi!! Loved this recipe.  I have made it a few times now and it has become a family favorite.  Its moist and really yummy.  I have added a 1/2 a cup of milk to the recipe for added moisture.  Delicious!!! The minute the cake is done, it's eaten immediately!!! It never lasts. My only issues is that no matter how butter I use for the pan, I struggle getting the cake out if the pan nicely.  Any tips?

This was an excellent recipe.  Simple ingredients, and easy to follow.   I sifted my flour twice and even though the recipe did not call for any, I added 1/4 tsp baking powder.  The cake came out very moist, light, and fluffy.  My whole family loved it, definitely one for the recipe box!

Cake looked beautiful when I took it out of the oven. But upon cutting into it, I found it to be extremely greasy and the flavor was not all that great. Did not remind me of a pound cake at all. I would try another recipe before this one.

I didn't care for the taste of this pound cake at all. I followed directions and added 1/2 c. sour cream as suggested. The crumb was wonderful. It tasted better the 2nd day but I still did not like it. I prefer the taste of evaporated milk I guess in my pound cakes.

This cake was fabulouso!!! My family loved it. Even more, my Grandmother said it was the best cake she has tasted in 20 years. In place of the white sugar, I used brown sugar. I also grated alittle bit of lemon into the batter. Thanks everyone for the wonderful suggestion. Next time I'm going to add alittle cardamon. Yummy!!!

I've made this several times, with great reviews every time!  I'm going to make this tonight, slice the cake in half and put a slurry of strawberry filling from the "Frosted Strawberry Shortcake" recipe with sliced strawberries and whipped cream on the top.  Yum, this is my kind of strawberry shortcake.  None of that sponge cake junk for me!

This is definitely a great cake and pretty simple. I used it as a base for strawberry shortcake and it worked terrifically (yum). Alone it would have been dry though. I think next time I use this recipe I'll add a little sour cream.

Wonderful cake!  I used the juice of 2 lemons to make sour milk (didn't have any buttermilk) and to add to the cake in place of the extract.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, except I completely forgot to add the vanilla extract.  I couldn't wait for the cake to cool to try it.  Then I made a glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar to pour over the top.  I personally think it was better without this.  I will definitely make this cake again.

My family really enjoyed this cake.  Easy to  make and mine turned out very moist.  Thanks to reviews from others, I set the timer for 1 hour and kept checking it after that.  Ended up shaving 20 minutes off the time.  Served with strawberries and whipped cream.

Great cake! I've made it once according to the recipe, and again to make it a pink & yellow marble cake for my daughter's 3rd birthday. All you need to do is separate the batter mixture into two portions, and in one portion pour in a pack of strawberry gelatin (or whatever flavour you prefer, though red ones look best IMO). Pour both portions of batter into the pan and stir slightly with a spoon to get the marbled effect. Be careful not to stir too much or you will lose the swirled effect! Bake as normal and frost as desired. It looked brilliant and the jello gave it a nice flavour. It was a big hit with everyone, and the marbling makes it look really impressive for very little effort. Thanks for a wonderful, versatile recipe! :)

This was good, though I thought it could have been a tad moister. I subbed fresh squeezed juice of one lemon in stead of extract. Also, as some other reviewers have said, it's a bit plain as is. I glazed it with a store bought lemon curd, which complimented it nicely.

Absolutely wonderful.  Instead of lemon/vanilla extract, I added 1/4 cup Kaluha.  It was devoured instantly.  Didn't take as long to bake as was listed.

Buttery, moist and perfect crumb.  The only thing I did that was different was only use 2 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfectly sweetened.  Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding. My mother raved. I used 2Tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, kept the lemon extract the same, doubled the vanilla, and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract. It drove me crazy to leave it in the oven. I thought surely it would dry out. Not so. It made a crazy good crust.

Very good flavor, but even though I shortened the baking time, it was still a little dry.  I doubled the vanilla and added 1 T lemon juice (in place of the lemon extract) and 1 T orange juice.  I planned on serving this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and Blueberry Sauce (from allrecipes) which uses orange juice so I added a little orange juice to this recipe as well.  A nice combination.

This pound cake recipe was great.  Very simple and easy. I added a tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp baking powder like others posted here and it came out dense, moist and delicious.  Has a bit of a crunchy exterior, which I liked. The batter fit into 2 loaf pans.  I was able to freeze one and my husband ate the other.

This pound cake was good.  Not excellent but very good. It's rather dense - like a pound cake should be.  It's moist but it could easily be overbaked and become dry so be sure to watch it closely in the oven.  I found it good plain but even better with icing.  Just a powdered sugar, vanilla & milk mixture for the icing. I bet it would be pretty with a touch of pink food coloring in the icing.  I made a double recipe (because I had so much buttermilk to use up) and it made 8 mini loaf pans PLUS a full bundt pan! I have a LOT of pound cake to eat!  AND I used 1 dozen eggs for the double recipe!  For the bundt cake I scraped a fresh vanilla bean into the batter. Wow, that was terrific!   This is a nice basic pound cake.  It would make a wonderful base for some strawberry shortcake.  Just make sure you watch it closely in the oven.  Oh, I think it could use a bit more extract than the recipe calls for. Vanilla, lemon or even almond extract would work really well.

Don't know what the problem was, but the cake fell while baking (somewhere between the 45 minute and 1 hour mark).  The oven door was never opened (I have a glass door).  I did notice that it did not seem to be rising in the initial baking time as I expected.  So disappointed to waste such good ingredients.

This is a good pound cake.  Measurements are standard for a pound cake but this one is lighter than a regular pound cake which is a good thing.  It has good flavor too.  All in all a good pound cake recipe.  Thanks!

This was the best cake ever and so easy to make! I made it almost exactly as written except I halved the recipe and made a few minor changes. The changes I made were to sub 1/4 of the sugar with brown sugar, upped the vanilla to 2 tsp, and used lemon juice instead of extract as this is what I had on hand. I baked in a loaf pan for exactly 1 hour and it was moist and delicious! Thanks Cathy, my family LOVED it!!

Very tasty cake. I used my food processor to combine the butter, sugar, and eggs and then did the rest by hand. It came out very much like the pound cake from the stores. I didn't have lemon extract on hand so I used 1/4 tsp of almond extract instead which worked very well. One I'll be making often!

Wonderful pound cake. Very dense and moist.  Did make changes as suggested by another reviewer and used the zest and juice of one large lemon and added two teaspoons vanilla extract.  Makes a great dessert with the addition of fruit or ice cream.

I had a sweet tooth and the only dessert my husband likes is strawberry shortcake - so I made this cake for it.  It was delish!  Easy to make and tastes wonderful!  I didn't have lemon extract so I used the juice from a whole lemon and zest from about 1/3 of the lemon.  It probably could have used a tad bit more.    I had a bundt cake tin and I lost track of time and forget to check on it and it cooked the whole time as per the recipe, browned a bit more than I would have liked - next time I'll probably shave off 5 min.

I halved this recipe and baked for only an hour. It turned out really great for my first pound cake and I'm really impressed. Next time I'd like to use real lemons over lemon extract and I'd like to use a taller pan, I used a small loaf pan. For those who say their cakes came out dense, use less 1tbs less flour and more egg yolks.

This is a really delicious cake, though it doesn't beat my stepdads( gotta get that recipe!)   I used real lemon juice but only for the frosting, with zest. Folded egg whites in at the end and baked in two roundpans for a layer cake. The cake came out moist and thick and yummy with a chewy outer crust and is a great base cake-my buttercream lemon frosting really compliments it. I'm a freshie and sick of box brownies and canned frosting! :X great cake 8D

Best pound I have had.  I used lime zest and real lime juice and pure vanilla.  I also glazed with a mixture of lime juice and sugar glaze.  Will use a plain glaze next time, lime juice glaze was a little tangy.  This is a really moist pound cake and I will use this recipe again!

made as directed, it has good flavor but way to dry and crumbly after sliced after 90 minutes baking time. May have to do with altitudes? Were 3,000 ft. Next time i will try the 60 minutes as another review suggested. I also followed the advice of using 1 cup powdered sugar with enough lemon juice to make a glaze it was very tasty but everyone had to have milk poured over the top to moisten it up.

This is an excellent recipe, and yes it is very simple; however, I would separate the eggs whites from the yolks--this really does makes for a super mosit cake.

I used this recipe to make a three tier wedding cake and it worked out perfectly. All I did was double the recipe for the bottom layer and bake for 2 hours and it worked out perfectly! It was also really tasty.

I have baked this at least 4 times at the request of my coworkers. It is dense and sweet and tender. At the suggestion of another review I made just a few changes: I doubled the vanilla, used 1 lemon plus its zest instead of the lemon extract, and made a glaze out of 1 cup powdered sugar and the juice of 1 lemon and drizzled over while still slightly warm. I don't even like lemon and can't help myself from taking a chunk when it's out of the oven!

I used a bundt cake pan. Big mistake. Though I coated it with cooking spay, the cake stuck like crazy. Also 90 minutes is too long. Maybe an hour and check every 5 minutes. The pound cake is very average at best. Too plain for my taste.

Had to let the batter set for 1/2 hour, while my hubby ran out & got some new buttermilk... but that didn't affect the outcome at all.  Made it exactly as the recipe indicated.  Has a rich, full flavor. Holds together nicely. Dense. This was my first attempt at a pound cake. This one was for my son's birthday. I plan to make another one tonight for my husband's workplace.  I will never buy Sara Lee again!  Thanks so much : )

This recipe was AWESOME!  My granddaughter (Taylor-7) and I made it together.  I did not deviate from the recipe.  However, I used parchment paper instead of coating the pan.  The cake was very moist and had a BEAUTIFUL golden color.  My neighbor and friends loved it.  It just melted in our mouths.  I may even try making it again tonight.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent cake!  I used Karlmale's suggestion (first review of 12/2003)and used fresh lemon juice and zest plus the powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze.  I replaced the vanilla with 2 tsps. of Fiori di Sicilia, and added a dusting of India Tree sugar crystals to the prepared pan before adding the batter.   Wonderful flavor and texture!

I made this cake to put into my Christmas Goody Bags and I was only kinda happy...  When I pulled it out of the oven after exactly 1 hour, it looked beautiful...all puffed up and golden and pulled away from the sides perfectly....I was very careful setting it on the countertop. I walked away and left it for 10 minutes... When I came back my cake had totally fallen!!!! :(  So I thought "Well...that side is on the underneath once I flip it anyway"  So I flipped it onto a wire rack and sliced it after another 30 minutes  Its super moist and very delicious!! It just looks a little funny   UPDATE:  I made this again after re-reading the recipe and seeing that I was supposed to leav it in the oven for 90 MINUTES not 60   !!, so this time I left it in a half hour longer (DUH).  The sides were a tad darker (not much) but it was fully cooked all the way through and did not fall.  Very VERY delicious.    Also, I spray the bundt pan with PAM then sprinkle it with granulated sugar instead of flour,   works beautifully and gives the cake a slight crunch and a sweetness  :)

THIS CAKE WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!  I love trying new pound cake recipes and when I found this one, I just had to try.  I read the reviews and they were all positive so I felt that this would be a winner!  I did vary from the recipe a bit.  In lieu of lemon extract, I used freshly squeezed lemon juice and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I baked it the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, and it was SOOOOOO MOIST AND DELICIOUS!!!!!  I also added a glaze of fresh lemon juice & 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  This will be a staple for the holidays!!!!!!

I have many pound cake recipes but I was looking for one that I could use some leftover buttermilk.  I dont like lemon pound cake so The only change I made was 2 tsp vanilla instead.  Very good pound cake. I would recommend for a birthday cake. It took the full 90 mins in my oven.  I will bake this one again.  Thanks

Terrific cake, however the cooking time was off by about 30 minutes for my oven.  If I had cooked it for the entire time suggested, it would have been a crispy mess. Also, I did add lemon zest and this definitely helped to bring out the lemon flavor.  Reduced sugar by 1/2 and served with my blueberry-brandy sauce.  Will make again.

Finally a cake my grandmother would be proud of.  This reminds me of my grandmother simply being in her element.  My kitchen is smelling wonderful right now.  

I was asked to make a southern old fashioned cake for my co-workers parents.  I was so impressed with the first one exactly as the recipe called for, I decided to see if I could improve on it.  So this is what I changed.  

I only used 2.5 cups of sugar.  I used the lemon and zest of 1 large lemon.  I used a tablespoon of mexican vanilla and didn't cream the butter and sugar as long.

The cakes both fantastic, but I think the 3 cups was too sweet for me customers.  

On a final note, this was very easy to make.

I found this recipe and I made it today. I didn't have any lemon or vanilla flavoring, so I used almond and mint instead. It turned out so moist! My daughter loves it!

This is delicous! Only I was dissapointed that mine didn't rise like the other pictures, it was very dense. I followed the recipe to a "t" minus the lemon extract, so not sure what happen.

I made a smaller cake at 10 servings. I used 1 cup milk just shy of a full cup w/lemon juice to make it a full cup (when you are out of buttermilk this works just fine)and had a wonderfully tasty cake that the kids and I are more than happy with.

This is a good recipe if you're trying to get rid of buttermilk already on hand.  Otherwise, I'd use a different recipe instead.  It was very good and moist, but not an all time best ever recipe.

I made  modifications to this recipe: I took out lemon and vanilla elements and replaced them with 1/2 tablespoon of cardamom.  I also folded almost a full bag of frozen blueberries into the batter.  Fantastic!!! The whole family loves it! This is a new classic!

This is my first pound cake that i baked! It turned out just great! Everyone who tried it loved it and they said it was really good! Moist, but a bit sweet. I used fresh lemon juice instead of the flavor and i used yogurt instead of the buttermilk! Thanks very much Cathy! I will definitely bake this cake again!

It was the best recipe and helped me use up leftover buttermilk successfully. Kept well for three days before my children finished off everything.
Now they are badgering me to make another. I plan to make cupcakes this time with the same recipe.

We used to make this cake when we were kids back in the 60's! It is still delish! One thing we added to the recipe was to separate the eggs and add the yolks to the creamed butter & sugar, but whip the whites to peaks and fold them in last.  The cake is abit lighter that way.  We omitted the lemon extract. Also, If you make 2 cakes, wrap the second in aluminum foil and save it a day on the cabinet, the sugar will crust on the top and make it taste even better!

Staggeringly good! And that suggestion to let it rest for a day before eating is true, it gets even better. Get everything ready and let it all come to room temperature before you start. Get a good oven thermometer, follow the excellent directions, don't peek in the oven while the magic is happening and you can't go wrong.

Good basic pound cake, although I was looking for the heavier, more dense kind like the Sara Lee in the freezer.  Still good, but not that heavy, dense cake I wanted.

Awesome recipe!  I took the advice of adding an extra tsp of vanilla, sugaring the pan & creaming the butter/sugar instead of beating.  It was perfectly done in 60 min.  I'll definitely bake this again!  I'm serving it today with sliced strawberries & whipped cream.  YUM!

Based on reading all of the reviews thus far, I made the following changes: 2 teaspoons lemon extract and 1 teaspoon vanilla, 2 1/2 cups sugar instead of 3.  Baked for 75 minutes instead of 90.  I also topped with a lemon/powder sugar glaze.....  I wasn't a fan of this recipe.  It didn't have much flavor and didn't have the typical pound cake texture - it was somewhat "floury".  In the future, I would use the full amount of sugar, juice of one lemon, and lemon zest.  Do not bake for 90 minutes!  Adjust based on your oven, 65-75 minutes.  It definitely needs a glaze!  Use a silicone tube pan with nonstick cooking spray - it came out without a hassle and clean up was easy!

Excellent!  Just what I was looking for.  The only thing I would change would be to lessen the cooking time.  My cake was done before 90 minutes and I should have taken it out.  I checked it at 80 minutes and thought it was done and decided to leave it in the extra ten, well, my cake came out a little bit dryer than I would have liked.  Oh well, still tastes good.

I waited one day to cut this cake to make sure it would be moist as others had suggested. I thought it was even better the third day. I put a lemon/powdered sugar glaze on it also which definitely brought out the lemon flavor. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a light and golden cake, but it needs something to go with it (like the Buttermilk Syrup recipe!)  Just watch it towards the end of the baking time so it doesn't burn.

This had a really good flavor but I thought it was kind of dry.  I don't know if maybe it was something I did?? I will be making this again and I will update if it turns out a little moister.  Overall it had a really good flavor.  I omitted the lemon flavor and used 4 drops of pralines and cream flavor for the King Arthur Flour Baker's Catalogue. Also, it only took an hour to bake.  Overall a pretty good recipe.  Thanks for sharing :0) UPDATE: If this cake seems dry - let it sit overnight and it is moist and perfect the next day!!  Changed my rating to a five.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe :0)

It's great everyone loved it hubby, family, and friends.  I baked this cake 3 times in one week.  The first time I baked this cake,  I used the original recipe the other 2 times I substituted the lemon extract with lemon juice.  The other time I used almond extract in every instance the cake came out delicious.  I baked the cake in a bundt pan.   Thanks for the comments and suggestions I always look at the reviews it's definately has helpful hints.

Wow, very good.  Nice change from traditional pound cake.  A little lighter with a slight tang.  I used lemon juice, because that's all I had.  I also halved the recipe (wish I had made the whole thing) because we never eat that much, but its only 12 hours later and it's almost gone.

Delicious.  The first time I baked it, I cut down the servings to 7, used a decorative bundt pan and used almond instead of vanilla flavoring.  My husband loves this cake so much, now I bake the the full recipe; fits nicely in an angel food pan.

This is a excellent cake.  I am very serious when it comes to cooking, and baking.  If i say it's good, it is just that good.  I did add a teaspoon of rum, almond, coconut, butter, which gives it a very nice flavor. I also made caramel to drizzle on top, it was to die for.

As another reviewer said, the cake has a flour taste.  I had buttermilk in and wanted to use it so I made this.  I won't make it again.  I have a lot of better recipes.  I didn't use lemon since I don't like lemon poundcake, I used 2 tsp. vanilla instead.  Mabe it needed the lemon.
For an icing I used my glaze:
1 1/2 cups sifted confectioners sugar
3 tbsp. warm milk
1/2 tsp. vanilla.
Mix and drizzle over cake.
That sweetened up the cake and made it less bland.

I, along with many others, hate it when people review a recipe that they did not follow, but instead changed.  However, I am guilty of this.  I cannot eat gluten, so I made this gluten free.  I used Cup 4 Cup premixed all purpose gluten free flour blend, and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder and around 1/2 cup of sour cream to the cake batter.  I baked it at 325 for 77 minutes in a non stick bundt pan.  After baking, I let the cake sit for 15 minutes, and it came right out of the pan.  Once it was cooled, I made a powdered sugar glaze icing (powdered sugar, milk, vanilla) to drizzle over the cake.  It was absolutely perfect!  I will make this again and again, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I’m no baker or chef, but thought the time was a bit excessive so I only baked for 60 minutes and it came out perfect! I also used vanilla and almond extract instead.

Yum is all I can say! I did everything as written, but used the zest if two lemons and the juice of one and the zest of a tangerine. My family thought it needed even more citrus, so I added the juice of one more lemon and a little more lemon extract. I also added 1/4 cup of sour cream to keep it from being dry. I added a lemon tangerine glaze and it is SO good!

This is my first ever review. The cake was super easy to make and I really appreciated all the tips in the reviews of others. I used only 5 eggs because I buy extra large eggs.  I used 2 tsps of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of lemon extract. I think I could have used 2 tsp and it would have been even better. I’ll probably also try fresh lemons as suggested by others. Thanks to all who gave tips on time to bake so it wasn’t dry.  I totally forgot to take a photo and the cake is now completely gone!  I’ll update my post with a picture the next time I make this keeper of a recipe.

OK.  So this waa my first time making a pound cake and I must say,  this came out amazing.  I subbed lemon extract for lemon zest and pretty much did everything else down to a T.  I was a bit mad because my cake kinda got stuff to the Pan a little but not enough to break the cake.  I buttered it well,  but should have used my non-stick spray as I usually do when I bake. Also,  I did half powered sugar and made an icing using Rumchata for the other half.  AMAZING.

I've made this three times.  Took others suggestions and added more vanilla - 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond.   This was almost too sweet so the next time I made it I added 1/2 tsp lemon peel.  The last time I made it I dropped some blueberries in the batter.   That was the perfect balance.  If you plan on glazing this, I would back off a little on the sugar.

I've used this recipe to make cup cakes. Only change I made was adding lemon juice rather than extract.  Also I probably use more vanilla extract and lemon juice than listed bc I didn't measure.   For cupcakes I set the oven for 350 and cooked about 20min (don't quote me on the time). They came out very delicious. Made them for a Christmas party and it hasn't been a week since Christmas and I'm on my second batch for my house.  Very important tip for baking...make sure all ingredients are room temp (eggs, buttermilk, butter).  If I haven't allowed things to sit out I sit the eggs in warm water and heat the butter and buttermilk in microwave to take the chill off.  Make sure you throughly mix in each ingredient.

It was delicious!!! I cut the recipe in half (bc in only had 1.5c gluten free flour), reduced the sugar by 1/2c and doubled the vanilla, as was suggested by other reviews & it was amazing!!!! I made cupcakes bc I couldn't find the cake pan. They were devoured! I also made a rum buttercream icing to top off the cake. It's definitely a repeat. The cake wasn't too sweet, the flavor was excellent

I forced my self to follow the recipe almost exactly, using a cup of soy milk and a teaspoon of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk because I can't have dairy. I will almost definitely make it again, but next time I may add something a bit more daring to the recipe. Thank you for a great cake recipe to add to my collection. I admit I have not tasted it yet, but my sister loves it.

I added mandarin oranges to the batter just before pouring into the pan.  Folding them in gently.  My friends and family loved the added surprise and asked me to keep it in my "make often" box. *laughs*

Making it again today since it went over so well and I am adding dark chocolate shavings and coconut with diced almonds.

This is a great recipe!  I made four mini loafs from this recipe, baking time approx 45min.  The only thing I did differently was double the vanilla extract and used some fresh squeezed lemon juice cause that's what I had.  I made a topping of sliced strawberries, sugar and lemon juice mixed together and added that on the sliced cake after it was cooled with some whip cream, delicious.

Cake turned out beautiful and moist and disappeared real fast.  Only change I made was to add a little nutmeg to recipe and a  powder sugar/butter icing to drizzle on cake thinned out with fresh squeezed orange juice instead of water or milk.

the last pound cake i made was sooo dry....but this one...that is not the case at all. The buttermilk makes it so moist and delicious. The cake is very dense but that is what made it perfect for strawberries and whipped cream! Easy to measure out, mix and bake and it only baked in my oven within 45 mins!

This is the pound cake recipe that I've been looking for. This is what I think a pound cake should be like!  I followed the example of others and used real lemon juice and zest to make it more like a lemon pound cake. We had it with frozen strawberries and real whipped cream.  Excellent!
This pound cake is perfect to eat by itself or to frost with a good lemon icing. Definitely a go to recipe.

I make this pound cake all the time.  The texture is exactly what you want in a pound cake- moist & dense & the flavor is perfect. It always bakes in 70 minutes in my oven.The only changes I make are to use almond extract in place of the vanilla and lemon. I also use plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk. (I've made it with buttermilk also & the taste & texture is the same with the yogurt as the  buttermilk. I just always have plain yogurt in my fridge.) I like this pound cake best plain but it's good with whipped cream & strawberries, or an almond glaze- even just some butter spread on a piece! Leftover slices of this pound cake freeze really well too.

I've made this twice now. It definitely took 90+ minutes for me. My oven is only 2 years old so it should be fairly accurate.

The first time I did it nearly as exactly directed except I used fresh lemon as opposed to lemon extract.  I didn't use any glaze or frosting as i actually really like pound cake on its own and wanted to see if this recipe was good on its own. I liked it but my wife said it was moist but didn't taste much lemon. 

So the second time I used an extra tablespoon of vanilla extract and extra tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. This definitely made it much more lemony to the satisfaction of my wife.  I also added a lemon glaze and a simple lemon frosting to add more lemon flavor to the final product.

I followed the advice of KARLMALE and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1.5 teaspoons of cardamom and zest of a whole orange and juice of half of a huge orange (I didn't have lemons). I also made glaze by mixing juice from the remaining orange with confectioners sugar. I do think that it is on a sweeter side, I prefer my desert a little less sweet. But I know that most people like it this way. It turned out moist and flavorful. I will be making it again, probably with walnuts next time.

Came out great. I substituted with 1 and 1/2 cups brown sugar and added 2 cups of nuts. I also poked holes and poured over a warm brown sugar sauce. Finally, topped with a vanilla glaze. To die for!

Texture (not too crumbly and not too dense) and flavor was good but waaayy too sweet.  Top was crusty and cake was sticky around sides due to too much sugar.  Will cut back to 2 1/2 cups sugar next time.  Will also flour pan after greasing since cake stuck to it although I used a non-stick Bundt pan and greased it well.

This was my second time creating a pound cake. It was not as successful as my first among my family but it was still pretty good. I followed the directions exactly. When greasing my dish, I also floured it (I have always been told to do that and while I'm not an experienced baker, I did so with this as well.) It still stuck some, I assume this was an error on my end.  My biggest issue was the cooking time. I took it out at 70 minutes in and it was already close to overcooked. If I hadn't checked it, I am sure it would have burnt at 90 minutes. May have been my oven but the last one I tried said to come out at 60 minutes and I should have did the same with this one. The buttermilk was a nice change. I like the tartness it provided.

Added 1/2 stick butter and 1/2 cup sour cream. Came out wonderfully! Yum!  I believe it would be great as is. Added those per another reviewer's recommendation because I love butter and sour cream.  I  already had them on hand. Why not?

The only chg I made was, I  added rum to the sauce.  Just enough to give you a wow factor.  It did not damage the integrity of the structure in the cake. Looking forward to the next cake/meal.  kj

This makes a perfect layer cake-no need to trim off any cake as the layers bake evenly. I just used two teaspoons of vanilla for a nice neutral base. One recipe made three 8" round layers (2" high). I also tried making these into cupcakes, but it didn't work out.

I have a question. Recipe says not to open oven door for one hour. Is that one hour after it finishes baking, or one hour after you put it in the oven?  Although this  is just a question, I had to select a star rating.  I'm hoping this tastes like the buttermilk pound cake my mother used to make.   Thanks!

Okay- tech issues :) - As I was saying, I'd made this recipe for a potluck, and it was a huge hit! I took pieces of suggestions from other reviews and I think it made for a winning cake. Here are the tweaks I made:  I used the zest and juice of one lemon; I added 2t of vanilla; i added 1/2 c of sour cream; added 1 1/2t of ground cardamom(the wow factor!); and I used five whole eggs and one egg YOLK. The cake was so moist and flavorful! I also baked it for almost 90mins at the stated temp and used a 12in tube-pan. I did beat the butter and sugar for a good five minutes.

I was looking for a cake recipe to serve with strawberries on Memorial day.  I was especially looking for cake because my son is not wild about the biscuit type shortcake.  This is the best pound cake I've ever eaten.  Everybody raved about it.  It did not disappoint.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This turned out pretty good! I added some rhubarb (cooked with a bit of sugar, butter and whiskey in a pan first) to the batter and it was really nice. I'd make this one again. It is very sweet but that's how this type of cake is suppose to be!

I've just finished making this for the second time.  Awesome recipe!!  Follow just as written and don't change a thing!  Take it from a southern girl who grew up eating Grandma's pound cake and knows just how it should be.  This one really does remind me of hers.

Love this recipe! Used the zest and juice of one lemon in place of the lemon extract - the produces a very lemony pound cake. If not a fan of lemon pound cake, don't add any lemon and increase the vanilla extract to 2 - 3 teaspoons. The pan needs to be very well greased or the cake will stick. Adding a glaze is a wonderful addition.  The cake has a bit of a crunchy exterior which is a great contrast to the moist cake.

good, easy recipe; however, following all directions, I was unable to remove the cake from my non-stick, greased bundt cake pan. What a frustration! Finally managed to pry it out of the pan, but left the top layer stuck in the pan. I would advise, grease, flour the pan, heavily before adding batter. I had no lemon extract so used 2 tsp of lemon zest. Nice flavor to eat plain or with added fruit compote/trifle, fresh fruit.

Nice flavor. Took the 90 mins to bake.  I followed suggestion  of Karlmale and substituted the lemon extract with the juice and rind of one lemon ,added 1 tsp. Cardamon and made a glaze.
Also added 4ozs. Cream cheese.
Its not completely cooled and a quarter is already gone. Thanks for the recipe Cathy.

Delicious by itself! But usually I prefer to bake this recipe in two large loaf pans so I can make them two different flavors. Lemon is nice and refreshing, but we also love coconut (with coconut extract instead of lemon and some coconut shavings on top) and my favorite, almond (with almond extract instead of lemon, obviously).

I made this and followed the directions. It was very delicious and my family loved it. Only lasted 2 days, I'm about to make it again tonight for dinner tomorrow. I sifted my flour as I always do when baking cakes. I'm just old school when it comes to that.

I used the feedback from several bakers who mad his recipe before and the result was delicious. I substituted Pillsbury All-purpose gluten free flour for regular flour 1:1 and the cake was amazing. You can't even tell it is gluten free. I also used Real Lemon lemon juice instead of the extract (3 teaspoons) and an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. As per another review, I creamed the butter and sugar together for about 5 minutes before adding the flour mixture and buttermilk alternatively. The top baked up to be a golden brown with a slight sugary crunch. I baked the batter in two loaf pans and cut the pieces up into small squares for dipping in a chocolate fountain. Definitely a recipe I will use again and again.

Really nice pound cake. It's not as dense as a traditional one, and is very tender. I subbed fresh lemon juice and the zest of a lemon for the lemon extract, and added a teaspoon of vanilla paste.

Excellent and easy! I followed the advice of others and used the zest and juice of one lemon instead of lemon extract. I have a 6 cup bundt pan so I just halved the recipe and it fit perfectly. For buttermilk I used milk + lemon juice. Delicious as is, not too sweet, and the lemon flavor wasn't overpowering. Will definitely make again!!

loved this recipe. instead of using three cups of white sugar, i used two cups of white sugar and one cup of firmly packed brown sugar. also, instead of one teaspoon of vanilla extract and one of lemon extract, i used two teaspoons of vanilla extract and no lemon extract. the results were delicious. i've made it on two separate occasion and both receptions were positive; people really enjoyed it. this will be my go-to pound cake recipe moving forward. thanks a bunch! ??

I made this cake for Thanksgiving. I was surprised that it turned out great the first time! I used all of the ingredients listed and actually enjoyed beating in the eggs one at a time! Anyway, since I used a bundt pan the bake time was reduced to 70 minutes. It tasted just like I wanted!

I was looking for a basic pound cake to have with my tea and tried this recipe.  I did very little to change it...increased the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon, added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, omitted the vanilla and substituted pure almond extract, used fresh lemon juice instead of lemon extract, and added 3 ozs. of cream cheese.  I didn't think this pound cake needed a glaze at all, just the right amount of sweetness.  Perfect with my cup of tea!

I only used five eggs because I didn't have six and didn't feel like making a run to the store. So in place of the missing egg I used a little bit more buttermilk. The result was a delightfully dense pound cake, albeit a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I think I will try two cups of sugar instead of three.

Excellent recipe, came out perfect! The whole family raved over it! I didn't have buttermilk so I added vinegar to the milk and a table spoon of sour cream. Instead of lemon extract, I added the juice of a whole lemon and the rind which was suggested by Karlmale. This is the definitely a keeper and fave!

I made this cake with 2 changes. I don't care for the slight lemon flavor in a pound cake so I excluded the Lemon Extract and doubled the Vanilla. I also substituted Whole Wheat Pastry flour for AP flour. The cake turned out just as I'd hoped, dence & very flavorful. Went great under fresh strawberries w/whipped cream but was also excellent straight up with a cup of coffee.

Absolutely Delicious! I made a buttermilk substitute by adding the juice of half a lemon to the milk for about 10-15 mins. I also didn't add the lemon extract. I've made this recipe atleast 5 times whenever I needed to use up my eggs.  Note: don't make this in a loaf pan because it is very likely that it might burn from the bottom and sides (mines did)

THE CAKE WAS EASY TO MAKE PLUS MY KIDS AND HUSBAND LOVED IT.  I PUT THE BATTER IN 3 SMALLER PANS INSTEAD OF 1 LARGER ONE AND  REDUCED THE COOKING TIME.

I wanted a recipe for pound cake that would work well as the centerpiece for strawberry shortcake. This recipe was fabulous!!!... The only suggestion that I have is to adjust the time according to your over and cookware. My bundt pan was dark metal and my oven tends to cook faster than most.  I adjusted my cooking time and it took a total of 60 minutes.  Another minute would have been too much.

Based on the 'most helpful criticism', I reduced the sugar in this recipe to half the amount. I was out of vanilla, so I used brandy for the flavoring. It turned out nicely for a fruit topping w/whipped cream.

1 of my favorite if not the favorite pound cake recipes I have found outside of my family. I love this one because it never fails & it's became my go to recipe. I just change up the extracts and maybe add a topping for quick change ups when needed or wanted. This is a must have recipe for every family recipe book!

Really good! I made mini bundt cakes.  Baked 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.   I took the advice of others & used fresh lemon juice & lemon zest.  Also added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon & 1/2 cup sour cream. Made it really moist!

Loved this cake!  I made this for my daughters birthday and it was a hit.  However, I made this in a bundt pan and had difficulty getting out -- as in I had to cut it out!  Next time I will grease and flour the pan.  In spite of this the flavor was awesome!

This was excellent. Used juice and peel of large lemon and added dollop of plain, non-fat yogurt. Also added 1-1/2 tsp. cardamom per one reader's suggestion. Excellent texture and balance of flavors!

When I first made this, I was a bit reluctant about how it would turn out, but it happens to be one of most delicious things I've ever tasted! I agree with other people about the sweetness, but this doesn't lower my rating. It also lasts awhile if you freeze it. I also love this pound cake because you can garnish it with whatever you feel like. Strawberries, ice cream, etc.

This  is a great  cake. I made a couple of adjustments. I used 1/4 th of a tsp of baking powder, instead of baking soda, and I used whole milk.

I think this recipe is not terrible, but was way too sweet. If I make this cake next time, I will definitely make it with A LOT LESS SUGAR. I reduced the recipe as I did not want to make a big bundt cake. I still thought that 2 cups of sugar was too much for 2 cups of flour. At the moment, I checked the mix and it seemed right,but by the time I tried the cake, I was right with my guess! I will also add more lemon flavor from juice and zest as this cake is very similar to another recipe from this site called Yummy Lemon Coconut Loaf. I noticed also that my cake stuck to the loaf pan a bit,but I quickly figured out that this was due to adding too much sugar to the mix. I want to think that probably reducing the recipe had to do with the extremely sweet outcome therefore my OK rating.

I made this cake yesterday, but had to make minor changes. I added two teaspoons of vanilla extract instead of one and one half cup of sour cream to give the cake more moisture. The cake came out Great. I will make this cake again. Delicious!!!

This is a GREAT recipe.  I used limoncello instead of lemon juice and 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  It is wonderful and held up beautifully.  I also shifted my flour twice before adding, as I find this makes a difference.

Simply delicious!!! I made sure it cooked without disruption for an hour. Eyeballed it to see if it was coming away from the sides. Checked it with the cake tester and took it out to cool. Oh boy!!!  While it cooled I could smell the goodness. I will absolutely make this again!!!

This cake is delicious-moist and dense!Made my own buttermilk and separated my eggs making sure to beat the egg whites stiff and adding to the batter last by folding in. I also creamed butter and sugar together before adding other directions from the recipe.
This recipe is Husband and toddler approved and they are a tough crowd! Will use this recipe again and again!

I just made this cake for a friend of mine for her Thanksgiving dinner.  Can I say that my kitchen had this wonderful smell and the cake turned out beautifully.  The ONLY change I made was to substitute almond for the vanilla.  It's safe to say I will definitely be making this for Christmas.

My lady friend loved this recipe. However, I added a name (Apple Cinnamon Crush Cake) some cinnamon and 3 cored/sliced apples. Instead of cooking it for 1 1/2 hours, It cooked for 1 hour.  Its still turned out great thanks.

I tried this recipe last night, and overall, the cake was super moist and flavorful.  The only thing I would tweak is the amount of sugar the recipe called for; it was a tad too sweet for my palate.  Other than that, it was delicious!

The crust is crisp and chewy - oh so good. Texture of the cake is just like my grandmother made.  I used 3 tsp of lemon extract and 1/2 of vanilla to give it a stronger lemon flavor. Everybody loved it.

Great pound cake!  I added a little almond flavoring and 2 tbs. Crisco shortening.  This cake was very moist and light.  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose.  For each cup of cake flour, I added 2additional tablespoons of cake flour.  Delicious!

Not sure what happened.  Mine turned out very dense.  Yes, I know pound cakes are supposed to be dense, but this wasn't very tender at all, and I even substituted cake flour for half the flour, which should have yielded a more tender crumb.  The flavor is good, though, but I would have preferred something that rose a little more.  If I do try this again, I may follow another favorite recipe and reduce the oven temp to 300 degrees.  I'll keep looking, and/or experimenting.

One of the best pound cake i've ever tasted. I followed the reviews, added an extra 1/2 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of tenderflake shortening, 1/2 cup of sour cream and i didnt have lemon extract so i replaced it with real lemon juice, and added an extra tsp of vanilla. Really good, next time i'll add lemon rind too. The sad thing is, obviously, this recipe is really fattening! I will make this on extra special occasions ONLY that's it.

This is a very tasty cake! It has a coarser crumb more akin to a very rich coffee cake with pound cake yumminess. Its a good cake, more akin to a rich buttermilk cake.

Very potential, my family and I liked it. Not sure if I let it stay in the oven too long. I should have only probably did 45min instead of an hour. But very tasty, love the flavor. A little dry to me, so once again it could have been me. I'm not a pro baker or cooker...lol learning in progress.

I have many pound cake recipes, some from southern family members who were known for their pound cakes, and my family loves them. I am considered a very experienced baker. I followed this recipe as written,with the only exception being that I added lemon and orange zest along with the flavorings. The little extra citrus just adds a fresh clean taste to cakes of this type. I also agree that a key to many good bake goods is to beat the butter and sugar for, at least, five minutes until it looks yellow and creamy. It only took 65 minutes in my oven when baked in a bundt pan and I didn't check it until 1 hour had passed. Keep in mind that ovens do vary and cooking times may not always be exact.
I topped mine with a 10x sugar glaze using gran mariner.  Just drizzled lightly over warm cake. Also good with lemon glaze, using real lemon juice and zest, or orange zest and juice. This slight tartness might counteract some of the sweetness others don't prefer.  We thought this cake was wonderful!

This cake does taste good but definitely needs extra vanilla and/or lemon extract and less sugar than called for. Definitely needs to be eaten at room temp. And don't over whip the eggs and butter and be gentle with mixing in the flour. I don't think I'll make again but if I do I'll definitely add extra buttermilk as per other reviewers.

swapped out 1 cup of the sugar with Splenda and it still turned out pretty good. Also added grated peel of a small lemon for extra flavor.

I liked it, the only change I made was adding 2 cups of sugar instead of 3, and still felt it too sweet, but very good

I wasn't impressed with the texture of this cake at all.  Seemed TOO dense, but also had a strange crumb.  The only thing I changed was to add lemon zest to the batter.

perfect basic pound cake easy when you follow instructions, would make a really good Jelly Roll! i did in small personal tube pans and 30 min it was done.  as far as the dry comments I do not think they beat after each egg this turned out perfect just follow the easy instructions its a no fail! Great recipe i will experiment with on my daughters birthday... grape or strawberry jelly maybe.

I doubled the recipe and made 5 mini-loaves.  Cooked in 60 minutes, and they all came out looking beautiful and smelling great.  The texture wasn't to my liking though - extremely dense, very eggy, and a bit too rich for my tastes.

I messed up and baked it in a two piece 10" tube pan. The batter began leaking out onto the oven floor. I had to open the door after about 15 minutes and insert a baking sheet underneath. I do not know if this affected the cake or not. It was done in 60 minutes, the first time I tested it. I think it could have used less time. It still filled the pan even with the leaking. As per another reviewer, I added the juice of 1 large lemon and grated rind in lieu of the lemon extract. The flavor and texture is excellent (used Swan's Down cake flour per box measurement). It was just a bit dry so was probably due to over baking. I will try again and use a Bundt pan. I lost the top crust when I inverted it from the tube pan, top down. Tsk tsk!

Very good recipe...turned out beautiful! The consistency was great. It only needed to cook for about 60 mins in my oven at the temp given, any longer would have burnt it. I was in the mood for a more nutty flavor so I used Almond extract instead of the lemon, but will give lemon a try next time I'm in the mood for something zesty.

YEEESS!! This cake is great!! Only thing I changed was using almond extract instead of lemon extract and I used the old mix vinegar and milk trick to get the effect of buttermilk. As a true pound cake it tastes better the next day. I had to stop myself from going back for more last night. Great recipe thanks Cathy!

This is a great cake... A little heavy, like a pound cake should be.  I used lemon and lemon zest instead of lemon extract, which gave it great flavor.  Try it!

So delicious and very easy to make! It tastes very similar to Madeleine cookies you buy at Starbucks or Costco. I followed the recipe but omitted the lemon extract and added 2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of just 1 tsp. I will definitely make this over and over again! I baked it for exactly 90 mins in my bundt pan and it came out moist and fully cooked.

This was ok. I followed directions exactly, except using almond extract because I didn't have the lemon extract. The crust was divine! Loved it! However, this made too much batter for my bundt, and I know it was a 9 or 10" and not any smaller. Totally overflowed. The flavor was good, not great, but definitely better than store-bought. But it was definitely a bit dry. I think I might do what another reviewer mentioned and add sour cream or maybe yogurt next time to see if it adds moisture. Thank you for the recipe.

My bad, but I should have covered the last 30 minutes, my oven tends to cook hot.. and using an old dinged pan wasn't a great idea either!  The texture and flavor are terrific though!  I used almond extract and vanilla.  I also added 1/2 cup sour cream when I was beating in the eggs.

I loved this recipe! I've never made pound cake before and was craving some kind of cake with ingredients I already had. After reading reviews, I added an extra tsp vanilla, and instead of lemon extract I used zest from a good size lemon and the juice. I also made a glaze from a cup of powdered sugar and the juice of another lemon to make it sticky but runny enough. I poked a bunch of holes in the cake and put the glaze on top. Delicious!! The only down side is that it took so long to bake...I took about ten or fifteen minutes off the time.

Great cake!! I shared it with some neighbors and they just loved it.  My daugter told me "mom, this is a great cake" and she's only 9 and very picky.

This cake is delicious. This was the first cake I have ever made from scratch. The lemon glaze I topped it with added the perfect touch.

We loved this! I cut the recipe in half, baked it in a loaf pan, but used the ingredients as directed.  Wonderful with strawberries and whipped cream! Very easy to put together using items already in my pantry. Thanks!

Excellent basic pound cake!  Didn't have a tube pan on hand, so I put it in two loaf pans.  Timing is still about right--they needed over an hour to be done.

Was looking to use up some buttermilk. Like another reviewer, I too found the eggs to be overwhelming. My cake also stuck to the pan even though it was well greased.

I thought this was an excellent poundcake. I did not find it too heavy even though I am pretty sure I let it go too long and too fast on the mixer. I made 4 mini loafs and 5 large muffin size loafs, cooking the mini loaves just over an hour and the muffin sizes closer to 30 or 40 minutes (not sure because I had to check a few times). I used almond instead of vanilla flavoring, and let the butter soften slightly before using. It is a sweet cake, not too sweet though, but next time I make it I plan to cut back on the sugar and instead make a glaze or other sweet topping for it, just to dress it up.

My family adored this cake! my own additions to this cake was to take a about a 1/2 box of confectioners sugar and mix it with lemon juice and apricot nectar to make a glaze. I then put holes in the cake with my fork and  poured the glaze over the cake while warm. I also added a 1/2 c. of sour cream for moistness. Wonderful!

This is the best poundcake ever in my opinion , I added real lemon juice and upped the vanilla to 1 1/2tsp  My husband & I are addicted to this cake. I had some batter left over since I was using 2 smaller pans so I used a cupcake pan thinking I could get some small individual servings out of it to use for strawberry shortcakes. By the time the tops browned the were dry and caving in a bit.( Because I tried baking all together and had to open the oven too early)  I did make some small cupcakes with this batter in my counter oven and they turned out fine, just didn't cook them as long.

This was a very good basic recipe.  The only thing I felt was lacking was the flavoring. Whether you use 1 tsp lemon & 1 tsp vanilla as the recipe calls for or substituting 2 tsp vanilla, it lacked flavor.  What worked very well was a lemon variation where I used the juices & zests of two medium lemons & 2 tsp vanilla.  It had a very nice, super lemony taste.

This is a very good recipe. I did make a couple of changes. 1st I cut back on the sugar, using only 2 1/2 cups. 2nd used 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and finally since I was using  a dark non-stick tube pan, I lowered the temp. to 300 degress and baked for 80 minutes.  Did not have the raised dome that I would like but the sweetness was perfect and the crumb also.  The next time I use this recipe I'll try separating the eggs and fold in the whites as suggest by a preivous reader.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas. The family loved it. I'm not a big fan of lemon flavored cakes but this cake is subtle in lemony flavor, not over powering at all.

I made this cake as my first attempt at a Buttermilk Pound Cake, and it was great.  I halved the recipe, used real lemon instead of extract, and, because I ran out of sugar, substituted 1/2 brown sugar instead.  Like a previous reviewer, I also added 1/4 cup sour cream.  Overall, it would be great with coffee, but my husband said it wouldn't last 'till morning.  Can't get much better than that.

I wasn't thrilled with it. I made it for dinner to take over to a friends house. It never did pull away from the pan like the recipe indicated, but a knife came out clean, so I took it out of the oven. Not much flavor. Very mild. Easy to make though.

Cathy, thank you for sharing this recipe.  I too like many others used the lemon juice and zest - delicious.  Dusting the pan with confectioners sugar is genious, loved the taste and crunch.  I used buttermilk powder, when I mixed it with water I used some sour cream, yum.

Used lemon zest and lemon juice per other suggestions, added 2 t. vanilla, and sprinkled bundt pan with powdered sugar.  My family loved it.  This is a dense pound cake and really does not need icing.  We ate it plain, but will try it with berries and whipped cream next time!

This was my first time making a pound cake. I thought it turned out great. I accidentally used baking powder instead of the baking soda and didn't realize it until it was too late. Even though I did that the cake still turned out great. I filled 3 loaf pans with the batter. I'm taking two for work and keeping one for the house. I will definately be making this one again.

My first attempt making pound cake and it cam out moist and delicious...I halved it to make a small loaf but added 1 tsp lemon extract and about 1 tsp lemon juice to make it more lemony! Went well with a lemon cream cheese frosting.

I had some buttermilk to use up, so I made this cake, using the recipe as it was written--no variations at all.  It was wonderful!   I did, however, have a little trouble removing it from my tube pan, but it's an old aluminum one.  I will be investing in a nonstick pan soon, so that I can make this cake again and again.  I can hardly wait for my daughter to get home from school to try it, as she loves pound cake.

I love this recipe. I took the advice of several others. I used brown sugar instead of white (which altered the color of the cake.) I used the juice and zest of one large lemon. I also used cardamon, as suggested by another baker, (was a great additive!) Once I had all ingredients mixed I added one container of lemon flavored yogurt to help with the moisture. This cake turn out great. I also made a simple glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar. Everyone loved it! Will make again.

Can't taste bad with all the butter -- but it was a very heavy, dense cake.  Maybe it was intended to be...certainly weighed a pound or better!  If I make it again -- I'll use less sugar for certain.

I enjoy trying new and different recipes, often they work out great but not always! I thought 3 cups of sugar was too large an amount for this cake, so I cut it down to 2 1/2 cups. After only 1 hour at 325 F (my bundt pan was the dark non-stick type), I checked it, sure enough it was baked and looked perfect. The problem was it would not come out of the pan even though I had greased it well. I noticed the lovely golden brown top was sort of crunchy as if it had been brushed with caramel, I realized it was probably that way all around and on the base of the cake. As I was taking it to a "cook-out" I decided to leave it in the pan, it was to be served with whole blackberries, a berry puree then  topped with whipped cream.  Sure enough it was sticky all around the cake so no wonder it wouldn't come out of the pan. I used my plastic cake server to cut and lift out the cake slices and no-one minded it not being on a plate, the cake actually was perfect with the berries and cream, though a little on the dry side to eat just as a "pound cake" rather crumbly too but the flavor was good. I am sure the amount of sugar was the reason I had the sticking problem, I wish I had followed my instincts and cut it down to 1 1/2 cups. Plus, with the ingredients of 1 cup of butter,  3 cups of sugar, 6 eggs, no way is it a "health friendly" cake. I 'll keep using my tried and true Sour Cream(lite) pound cake recipe which is  more health friendly.

This cake brought back memories of my grandmother...it has the same flavor, texture everything just like hers. Almost had tears thinking about her and her pound cakes. Thank you so much for posting this recipe! I did almost everything the same except no salt no baking soda no lemon extract only vanilla and regular 1% milk. But I kept everything else the same.

My family enjoyed this cake with sweetened sliced strawberries.  Although I am a pretty darn good baker, my cake fell.  I think my 5 year old was so excited about looking at the cake in the oven that she may have opened the door.  Oh well, it tasted great even though the middle sank!

Delicious and rich. I made it in two loaf pans, and I think I overbaked it a bit. I would start checking it at 75 minutes. Thanks!

I used parts of another version of the recipe and added the juice of a lemon with the zest, 1 tsp of cardamon, and about 1/2 cup of chopped chocolate chips. I think if I'd left out the cardamon and added a full cup or more of the chocolate chips it would be 4 stars. Otherwise it was okay.

Cathy, what a great cake. My first attempt at a pound cake as they are not really made here in Australia and I just loved it. I upped the vanilla extract and used the juice and zest from one lemon. Very easy and totally satisfying, this went straight into the recipe box...Joolz

I really like this recipe, but the fat content it outrageous, so I cut it down by using 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, and only 1/4 cup butter. Honestly, I'd recommend doing at least half-and-half. It still tastes delicious, and won't ruin your waistline.

This was great. It was my first attempt ever at age 39.9. It was foolproof. The crust was great it evenly cooked. I was sleepy and didnt have time to wait til it completely cooled. But I would recommend waiting. It was soooo good.

ohh yeah!  I switched up one cup of flour for whole wheat (we are "healthy" here) and used 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup splenda for baking and 1/2 cup regular sugar and it was delicious.  Even after I forgot the baking soda it still was yummy and rose a bit.  Will make again and again and. . ..

Excellent base recipe. I don't own a bundt pan so I did two rounds instead and made it into a layer cake. I used almond extract instead of lemon extract. I divided the batter in two separate bowls and flavoured half with instant espresso powder. I spread some raspberry freezer jam between the two cakes. As an icing I melted down some raspberry chocolate fudge cheddar with heavy cream, cooled and then combined with icing sugar until it reached the right consistency. Spread it all other the top and drizzle down the sides. Very yummy with changes, I'm sure its just as great as is. Definite keeper!

I gave it a five due to the changes I made.I did mix my butter first and then the sugar for about 5mins or so.. I added all my eggs at one time, then 1tbs vanilla, instead of using lemon, I used lemon emulsion 2teaspoons.and after mixing my flour and buttermilk, I added 1/2 cup sour cream and use three loaf pans.. It was very moist and had a nice lemon taste.. I made this last night and my kids and friends eat it up.. I took a loaf to work and I let you know what the verdict is on it.. but I couldn't stop eating it myself.. I did add powder sugar on top to give it a sweeter taste, but I don't think it needed it...

This is a very good cake.  I'd like to give it a 4.5 because it isn't quite a 5 for me, but very good.  I thought it improved with age but definitely needed a topic.  I made a blueberry sauce for it and overall the dessert was a success.  The cake is dense, not flaky but very tasty.

This cake had a lovely dense, moist texture. I have no idea how anyone found it to be dry.  I even overbaked mine a little bit and it was still moist. I used real butter (not margarine) and added a little cocoa powder to half the batter and made it in to a marble cake.  Next I am going to make the lemon version using fresh squeezed lemon juice and rind. I will comment!

I did not think this was dry at all!  I take it out of the oven 15 minutes early though- maybe that is why?  The only disappointment was that I did not find the lemon flavor to be strong enough.  Next time I will add more lemon extract.  I topped it with a lemon glaze and raspberries.  Yum!

Good taste, but somewhat on the dry side.  Also, I would suggest omitting the lemon extract or using real lemon juice.  The extract gave it a little artifical taste.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this cake.  I made it as a base for strawberry shortcake because I do not like the traditional sponge cake cups, angel food cake or biscuit type shortbread.  I added the strawberries and a "cream" made of Cool Whip, Sweetened Condensed milk and cream cheese.  Yummy!  I honestly think he must have gained 3 lbs. from this dessert.   Awesome cake!

The only thing I changed was to use cake flour.  This cake was very good in taste, but I would like to work on getting it a little lighter in texture.  Very good, though!

I made this today, as I like the flavor of buttermilk in baking. This is amazingly good. I plan to make a Fresh Blackberry compote to top this wonderful pound cake. A fresh dolop of whipped cream and I'll think I am in heaven. Thank you for such a special treat.

i added the peel of two limes and the juice of one lime instead of lemon to half the batter and an extra half of a tea spoon of vanilla extract to the other half and made a marble cake out of it, swirled chocolate through one of the pans of cake batter and caramel through the other and made a layered cake everyone loved it as far as i can tell

I made this recipe and it was fantastic! I added strawberries to it and my client absolutely loved it. Because I needed a dense cake that had lots of flavor and could be carved this worked perfectly for me. I will definitely use it again. I did not use real lemon juice or lemon zest. I had lemon oil on hand and it worked wonderfully. Great recipe... Easy to make.I started with serving size for 8 and then made it for 100. Same great taste each time .

My first time making a pound cake and it turned out absolutely perfect! I made lots of small cakes in ramekins, then cut then into slices. I did not need to alter a single thing! Cake turned out sweet (but not too sweet) and had a moist texture; wasn't dense either but not super light either. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This was just wonderful. The only change I amde to the cake was to add a bit more vanilla extract and soem orange zest (I thought I had lemon, but I didn't) I also made a quick glaze with powdered sugar and lemon juice to top it off. I made it in a pretty bundt pan. It took about 60 minutes to bake. I brought it to work and it vanished! It's not as heavy a traditional pound cake, which is nice

This cake is AMAZING!!  This is the first time that I ever made a cake from scratch and this cake was very easy and turned out perfectly.  I made the following modifications based on other's feedback:  reduced eggs to 5, reduced sugar to 2-1/2 cups, increased buttermilk to 1-1/8 cup and I used cake flour since I was out of All-Purpose.  I also used a stand mixer for the first time and it really made a difference as far as creaming the butter and sugar and making sure everything was evenly and well mixed.  I baked in a convection oven for about 80 minutes and the results were fantastic!  The cake is moist and has the right amount of density.  It also had a very nice cripsness to the bottom.  Only mistake I made was to use oil spray instead of greasing the pan...I'm still a rookie, but won't make that mistake again :)  Please give this cake a try...you will love it.

I didnt love this cake but I got huge raves from my husband and friends who ate it.  Followed directions as is but subbed more vanilla extract for the lemon as I didnt have any lemon.  I will keep looking for a poundcake recipe I can feel confident in.

I wish you could give 1/2 *´s. Anyhoo, I thought this cake was great but I will change somethings next time such as: adding more lemon (could not taste it really), slightly less sugar, and reduce the amount of eggs!! I felt a real eggy taste!! Oh, and I halved the recipe and put it in a 9x13" pan cuz that was all I had. I cooked it for an hr. but I think I should have followed the other reviews of 70 mins. I will definitly make this again, maybe next time with lime or an orange!! :P

This recipe isn't very good. No one really cared for it. It is very sweet. And very dense. I will try a different recipe

Yummy! I can't stop eating this cake. Other than using 2 tsp of vanilla, it's just perfect. I used it to make a car cake for Father's Day and even decorated it. It's not too sweet at all. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful!  Made this to celebrate our 2 boy's 6th and 4th birthdays with our families and frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting I from this site.  I used both vanilla and almond extract and opted to reduce the sugar to just over 2 1/2 cups as 3 seemed like sooo much!  It was easy to whip up and came out of my bundt pan looking great!  Anyway, the entire cake disappeared, not a crumb left.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this and have made it several times!  Only change I made was to increase the vanilla to 2 tsp.  It's very dense and moist and freezes really well.  Good with fruit, a light lemony glaze or just plain.

This was a very, very pretty cake, so I'll start with that.  However, the taste was very so-so.  I kinda only really tasted eggs and vanilla.  I think I would maybe make this only if I had buttermilk to use up, b/c my husband did eat this so it wasn't a total waste.  Thanks anyway..

Absolutely yummy!  It is so hard not to keep having another piece!!!  I didn't have lemon extract so I used fresh lemon juice and doubled the amount called for.  And my cake was done at 70 minutes.  Thank you so much for sharing!  This is a definite keeper.
