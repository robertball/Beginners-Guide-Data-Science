Left out the almonds and used almond milk. This was the first smoothie that kept me full until lunch.

I put 1/4 cup of oats, 1/2 banana, a little more peanut butter and more spinach. It still came out great! It tastes amazing! Although it is a little more than 1 serving. I would say 1.5.

This is good. I used coconut greek yogurt, no almonds and regular milk. (Didn't have all the right stuff). Great nut taste and plenty of protein.
