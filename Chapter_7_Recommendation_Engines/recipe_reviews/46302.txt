I thought it was pretty good....  PS. for the reviewer  CFELDHAUS...pancit is a noodle not a casserole, get your facts straight before bashing a recipe.  You've been a cooking instructor for 13 years, but other amateur cookers got it right the first time.

I made this for my family's 4th of July gathering, and they are still singing it's praises.  I'm constantly being asked when I'll make it again.  It's not the same as Lumpia I have had in the past, but still a great tasting version!  This one is a keeper!

OMG this was so good!. I only used chicken. I boiled 2 pounds of boneless
skinless chicken breasts in 1 quart water with a lid on and I used 1 package of preshredded cabbage and carrots. Since I boiled the chicken I used part of the broth as the sautee.  Added the salt and peper and started rolling. I must have made them to fat becasue I ran out of filling had about 5 wrppers left over and no meat and veggies for the pancit. Oh well live in learn. Every one loved how it turned. Definitely a make again recipe!

I am a chef (retired) - and I think a cooking instructor should know that some people do not know how to adequately write a recipe.  I find this recipe intriguing and when finished with fish sauce or pancit seasoning or any myriad combination of seasonings it is quite tasty and satisfying. I think that's what they mean when they say "season to taste."  I also believe any decently educated cooking instructor would know that pancit is a noodle and the name refers to several noodle dishes made with those noodles or similar type noodles. Usually a stir fry with different meats veggies and noodles flavored with soy sauce and fish sauce.  There are many variations.  A good pancit is priceless and never a casserole.  Spring roll wrappers can be found in Asian markets, some very large grocery stores, Wegman's grocery stores, or online. Bon Appetit   RT Crum

The person who thought the pancit was bland must have done something wrong because this was a wonderful recipe!  So simple, yet so delicious.  I wasn't sure how this would taste since the lumpia and pancit I've had in the past were different; but this just proves that different variations can all be equally delightful!

CFELDHAUS does not know what they are talking about, cooking instructor or not.  Pacit is a noodle not a casserole as another reviewer state.  Lumpia is a spring roll wrapper.  The lumpia was great.  The pancit, was bland.

Warning this recipe is bad.  It leaves holes on what to do.  How much is half a head of cabbage and how do you cut it?  Do you honestly think 1 pound of chicken cooked in water is going to do anything?  Then it was bland.  I added onion and garlic to try to save it.  Then 8 ounces of canton noodles do not need 8 cups of water to cook in. The recipe made it seem as if you should use all of it.  Quite frankly I only used 3 cups to get the noodles right.  Pancit is a casserole not a soup.  The remaining half of the mixture is supposed to go into lumpia's (made with spring roll wrappers not lumpia wrappers) and the mixture is way to coarse for that.  Definitely have to chop it fine.  Good luck making this.  I've been a cooking school instructor for 13 years and I had to really change it to get it to work.

Lumpia is about 3.5 stars, I must admit I like the chicken and pork instead of beef and pork for a change, the Pancit is a 1 star at best. VERY bland, if I were to make this again I would make 60 Lumpia and forget the Pancit! If I were rating the Lumpia alone I probably would have given them a 4 star.

Pretty tasty and easy to follow recipe. I would recommend boiling the chicken with soy or teriyaki sauce and water instead of water alone. The meat absorbs the sauce and tastes great. It also adds a great deal of flavor to the dish as a whole. Before boiling the chicken I season it with season salt, pepper,  & garlic.  All of the flavors boiled together are amazing. I also save the liquid after removing the chicken.  When cooking the noodles with the veggies & chicken for the pancit you can add the left over liquid as you go so the noodles don't dry out. Keeps the whole dish moist and adds a ton of flavor. Try it!

Very good. Almost exactly like my aunties used to make. Had to look up a video on youtube though on how to roll and seal them (with cornstarch)...

I have to admit that I bought the wrong type of wrappers.  I bought won ton instead of spring roll.  I think the flavor of the lumpia was good and would have tasted authentic had I bought the right wrappers.  However, the pancit was really bland.  Sorry.

thank u so much for puttin this recipe out. i have been in love with lumpia and pancit for so long but never knew exactly how to make it just right. I made the pancit and lumpia as said, EXCEPT i add chicken broth from can to get extra chicken flavor and add  a little bit of celery to the pancit. it was amazing.  AS A PROFESIONAL COOK, BOTH FROM THE NAVY AND CIVILIAN WORD THIS IS GREAT!! this recipe is simple and easy to follow with a bit of common sense. thank u!

I thought this pancit was bland too. I think I will stick with using Mama citas pancit canton seasoning packets.

Most large (not single cuisine) Asian markets have, purpose-made Lumpia wrappers in the freezer case.

Delicious and easy to follow. The cabbage should say shredded in ingredients  and i tried it with the thin noodles (bihon aka rice stick). dish came out delicious though!
