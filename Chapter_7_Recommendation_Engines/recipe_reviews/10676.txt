Tried this recipe for the first time tonight, but made a few changes after reading the reviews.  I used half butter and half shortning so my cookies wouldn't spread into pancakes.  I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown so that they would be a little softer.  Doubled up on the vanilla to put back the moisture lacking in the shortning.  After this they turned out perfect.  They spread a bit but are still nice and puffy, with no crunch at all!  Excellent recipe with a few mod, will be making again.

This Recipe was very good. Alot of you have said that they spread too much and are flat. I have been baking for years, and to keep any cookie from spreading flat while baking..... Chill the dough for an hour before baking. Trust me it works.

A bit different, but easy to make and tasty. I like chewy cookies and these definitely are.

I loved this recipe! Helpful hint: bake a test cookie first. If they spread too much when baking, add another tablespoon or so of flour so they hold their shape.

These cookies tasted great BUT looked horrible, FLAT as a pancake.  Perhaps more than 2 cups of flour would have helped?

DISGUSTING!!!  Ugh I really thought they would be good but my first batch spread
so much that the whole pan was a big cookie so when i took it off it wasn't even
totally cooked.  So for the next batch I made the balls smaller and I cooked it for
2 minutes longer.  They turned out as flat crispy "cookies".  My family tried them 
and said that they were too rich and buttery.  They were easy enough to make but
cleaning the pan was a nightmare.  I would not reccomed this recipe to any one 
with tastebuds.

So, my husband has said "Oh man, I think these might be my favorites so far," (he always calls me "man" when he's impressed), and "Curse you, vile woman" as he just took his 8th, 9th, and 10th cookie. These must be a hit! They are serious spreaders, so you'll want to chill the dough for a while before you bake them. I happen to like flat, chewy cookies, but these were a little too flat for me without chilling first. Still...they are awesome. Thanks! :)

You should definitely NOT MELT THE BUTTER in this recipe.  It is almost exactly the recipe on the back of the "Reese's Peanut Butter Chips" bag...except in the Reese's recipe there is 1/4 c. LESS butter and it is certainly not melted.  You should be able to "cream" the butter.  I would recommend just buying the Reese's bag and following the recipe on the bag (although it, too, can be altered to taste...for example I usually use less sugar and sometime will do part white/part brown sugar.)

After looking at the recipe and reading the reviews I knew I could solve the "pancake cookie" problem easily.  Instead of using 1.5 CUPS of butter, just use 1 cup.  Doing this made my cookies come out perfectly!  They're soft, moist and just right.

OH my chocolate! These are the most scrumptious cookies in the whole wide world. They are fluffy, chewy, and oozing with lots of extra peanut butter chips. I did make a few weensy changes. I used about 1/4 cup less butter then the recipe calls for, doubled the vanilla extract and substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for some light brown sugar. I also let the dough chill in the fridge for an hour before baking. I baked at 350 for 9 minutes. There was minimal spreading even though I made larger rounds, none touched. These are so worth the time!

Great cookies! Everyone really enjoyed these.
The texture was good, crisp outter rim and soft in the middle.But be warned the cookies must sit for a few minutes before removing from the pan to totally cool. Will make many many times to come.
Thanx for the great recipe!!

These were horrible.  They tasted bad and looked awful.  Even my kids wouldn't touch them.  Not a good sign when a kid won't eat a cookie.

THese cookies were not that good.  THey were flat, and spread on the cookie sheet so much I could only fit 4 cookies per tray without them getting stuck together.  The flavor is ok, but not anything to get excited about.  I wouldn't make them again.  I think the recipe for chocolate peanut butter cookies on the back of the bags of reeses pb chips is much better!

WOW!  The best cookie dough I have ever eaten!  My family was lucky I didn't eat it all before I baked the cookies!  I didn't melt the butter and I had no problems.  I also used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown, and used 1/2 C. less butter than the recipe called for, as per other reviewers.  YUM!!  Nice, Chocolaty Soft Cookies!!

I made these cookies last night. They were great but I did a few things differently. If you do not want the cookies to spread out a great deal then don't melt the butter. When you cream the butter and sugar it is best to just use room temperature butter, I always set my butter out the night before.  I also used half brown and half white sugar.  No spreading at all. If you don't over bake them and let them cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before moving them they turn out perfect. A very moist, chewy cookie is what I ended up with which is my favorite!

These are really great cookies.  I kind of hate it when people review a recipe but have made a bunch of changes.  But that is what I have done.  I was out of butter and marg.  so I used shortening and didn't add the water you are supposed to when you subsitute.  This made the cookies hold up their shape marvelously.  They were thick, soft and chewy.  Very excellent recipe.  thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe. I baked for 8 minutes and the cookies were crisp on the edges and soft and chewy inside. Awesome. My first batch (1 doz) were gone with 3 minutes of coming out of the oven. Kids & husband loved them. Would recommend to anyone. I loved them. Very easy to bake.

I made this last night, but replaced the peanut butter chips (which I usually don't like anyway - not peanut buttery enough) with a large bag of Reese's Pieces.  I put half the Resse's (a little over a cup) into the batter, and used the other half to press 4 or 5 into the top of each cookie just before baking them. They came out great.  Also, the batter seemed kind of thin to me, so I followed some other suggestions and added extra flour (about 1/2 cup) and some extra cocoa to stiffen it up.  Worked great.

Not bad cookies.  They do definitely spread if you don't chill them.  I chilled them, and definitely noticed as time went on that they began to spread in every direction as the dough warmed.  So, you may want to put the dough back in the fridge as you go, but definitely chill for at least an hour prior to baking.  If you chill for longer, like I did, you'll need a bit more time (about 11-12 minutes) to bake the cookies, depending on the size of your scoop.  I thought they were good, but nothing special, although they are chewy, which I appreciate.  Thanks for the recipe.

Did not like at all.  My wife and I were baking cookies for out two kids at college.   These cookies have WAY too much butter in the recipe.  We are both experienced bakers that should have known better.  I'm as mad at myself for using this recipe as I am the recipe itself.  I would use the first person's recommendation of using half butter, half margarine and increasing the flour and vanilla.  Otherwise, these are a disaster.

Followed the recipe, and as others said - they did spread out. I did make dough in advance and refridgerated for 3 days. I tried lowering the heat and cooking longer on the second batch, and that helped a bit. I ended up using a round cookie cutter to cut off spread out edges and 're-baking'. I brought these to my kids for Christmas, and I must say, they seemed to be very popular, and I received many compliments on them.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use Butter Flavor Crisco and used 1C white and 1C brown sugar. Using an insulated baking sheet, these turned our puffy, chewy and delicious! Yum!

I made 2 minor changes and they came out great.  Per a previous reviewer I reduced the butter to 1 cup and also used chocolate chips, since that was what I had on hand.  Will definitely be making again.  If your cookies flatten out too much, try letting the dough sit for 10 minutes before baking.

Giving it 4 stars only b/c I had to alter the recipe to get a better result.  I, too, used 3/4c butter (not margarine) + 3/4c shortening, as well as, 1c wt. sugar + 1c brn. sugar.  With these alterations, I didn't HAVE TO chill the dough.  I planned doing so, but made a test batch 1st b/c I was too impatient.  Even then cookies NEVER ran.  I still did store in refrigerator while waiting them to bake.  At first, I made small 2" cookies using the 1tsp scoop as directed, baking for 8 mins.  But that took too long & we prefer the big cookies.  Nervous about even baking & issues that often come up with large cookies, I eventually changed to using 1Tbls & flattening it out some (must do or will be uncooked in middle) and baking for about 12-13 minutes.  Made perfect, large chewy yet crisp delicious cookies.    W/out brown sugar-not as soft; with only butter-not worth attempting; chilling-as I made it, didn't seem to make a world of difference.   **always be sure to allow pans to cool completely between baking times**

I've made this a bunch of times with different results. The first time I used Reese's chips, and it was PERFECT. The next time, I used generic chips, and I couldn't figure out why the cookies didn't taste as wonderful. The reason was that the chips were softer and less cohesive once baked. It just made the cookies taste too gooey and buttery. I also figured out that 1 1/2 cups of butter was way too much butter. So, I just used a cup of butter the next time and they were much tastier. Next time, I'll go back to Reese's.   One thing about these cookies is that they are very gooey with all of the butter in there. Be sure to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour to make sure they don't flatten out. Also, they may need more time to set before you transfer them to the rack. They tend to fall apart VERY easily when still hot.

Wow!  These cookies are great.  Best when fresh from the oven.  If you can't get your kids to drink all their milk, just give them a few of these.  Very rich and delicious.  Had no problems with the butter like in other reviews.  Just softened instead of melted.

I love a soft cookie...and this didn`t disapoint!  Don`t be fooled when you take it out that it is undercooked, leave on pan for a few minutes and then carefully transfer to cooling rack.  PERFECT!

To avoid the problem of the cookie batter being too runny, just soften the butter, don't melt it, and put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before cooking.  THE PERFECT COOKIE!!!

I'm not a cookie lover - but these have reformed me! A few tips for those who have said they are too flat: Throw in a heaping teaspoonful of extra flour. Also, use 1 cup of dark brown sugar and 1 cup of granulated  white sugar. The brown sugar binds the dough and will help to make the cookies chewy. And, just barely melt the butter. Enjoy! These are the best!!

These are good IF you use half the sugar - WAY too much sugar!! I made these the first time exactly how the recipe instructed and thought too sweet. Made them again and used 1c of sugar instead of 2 cups of sugar. I also did not melt the butter (i do not know why some people said they melted the butter).

This recipe turns out a good tasting cookie, however, in order to avoid the "pancake effect", do not melt the butter.  Cream the sugar with room temperature butter, then follow the rest of the recipe.  This is how I always do my cookies, and they always turn out good (they do flatten a touch, but not even close to when you use melted butter!).

Kathy Jo was right.  These cookies came out flatter than flat.  Before baking, I chilled the dough as one reviewer suggested and even after the chilling, I noticed the dough was still soft.  But I baked off a batch anyway.  To make this recipe viable, I had to add 3/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup cocoa powder.  To those who have had success with this recipe, I am glad. However, I baked these on a normal humidity day at an altitude that is within the average so I don't know what went wrong.

Tastes like a delicious chocolate peanut butter brownie.  I decreased the butter to one cup, softened, and increased the baking time to twelve minutes because I prefer a crispier cookie.  These are so good, I'm tempted to eat them all by myself.

Very good flavors - but I think the butter is why some of the reviewers said they spread too much.  First, there is a bit too much butter.  I used 1 and 1/4 cups (reduced by 1/4 cup) and they didn't spread too much.  Also - don't melt the butter!  You should soften it at room temp and then beat in bowl until it is creamy. I also (almost always) add twice as much chips - because that's the way my kids like them!  For this, I use one bag of peanut butter chips and also a package of peanut butter M&Ms.  Yummy!

AWESOME!  I have been looking for a Chocolate Cookie recipe for years. I wanted one that tasted like the ones I got in Grammar School on Fridays. They were the best. Change the peanut butter to chocolate chips and you've got them.

I made exactly as written and these do spread into little pancakes.  It should be written into the recipe to chill the dough because not everyone reads a bunch of reviews before they start.  I always read reviews so I chilled the rest of the dough (just had to do the initial test batch to see those results).  They taste wonderful either way, chilled dough or not.  Just not as pretty with room temp dough.

These cookies are delicious!! I found the same recipe on the back of "Reese's Peanut Butter Chips"

I did a little substituting though. I replaced HALF of the butter with apple sauce (the 'no sugar added' kind, and used 1-1/2 cups of sugar (because, the apple sauce already has some sweetness to it).

And for those of you whose cookies that spread too much, I only softened my butter not melt them. and chill the dough, lastly use parchment/wax paper. I find that my cookies don't spread out as much when I use them.

I hope my tips help! =)

EXCELLENT! Mine didn't run at all - I didn't melt the stick butter, just slightly softened it. Then in between each pan, I put the mixture in the frige. Cookies turned out perfect - I love them!! :)

This cookie recipe came up in my ingredients search for "peanut butter chips".  I read many reviews and decided to use 1-1/4 cups of butter just softened to room temp., not melted, together with 1-1/2 cups of white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and increased vanilla to 2 tsp. (as well as the other listed ingredients).  I mixed everything together and then chilled the dough for well over an hour.  I always chill my cookie dough.  My cookies turned out fabulous!  They are not too flat, are crispy around the edges and are nice & chewy.  I got exactly 5 doz. cookies from this recipe.

These cookies were very delicious! I also actually had a few problems though. First of all my cookies were undercooked at 10 minutes which is what I was told to bake them at. I ended up baking them for twelve minutes and they finally were cooked. Also, my cookies got a little salty and I did not even put In a full 1/2 teaspoon.

I enjoyed these and disagree with the people who say these cookies spread on the pan and are hard and flat. I will definitely keep this recipe.

Very tasty cookies with a few modifications. I only put in 1 cup of butter, which was room temp intend of melted,  and replaced 1 cup of sugar with brown sugar, per other reviewers. These came out chewy and plenty thick. Quick and delicious!

This is was a really good recipe but I wasn't satisfied with the way the cookies turned out. They tasted great and were chewy but they were flat.  I will definelty make them again but take the other advise from reviewers about chilling the dough before making them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty, but the cookies turned out like pancakes even after I chilled the dough.  It still gets 3 stars, though, because my office mates said they loved the cookies!

I used 1 c. white and 1 c. brown sugar and also added a tsp. of coffee liqueur to the mix. I did not melt the butter before creaming with the sugars as I wanted my cookies to not spread in the oven. Very yummy!

These were delicious! I used softened butter, not melted and did not end up with thin flattened cookies.

Pretty great cookie.  Took comment advice and didn't follow the butter - I used 1c butter and 1/4c shortening (and 2 t. vanilla),  and I didn't melt it all the way - just reeeeeeally soft.  Cookies did not flatten out - consistency was almost perfect, like a toll house.  Hopefully they will stand the overnight test.

My history class really liked these cookies. I enjoyed them as well. The only problem was the fact that my first batch were a little crunchy.. maybe i shouldn't have baked them as long?

These were good but not great. I didn't think they were peanut buttery enough, which may have been the fault of the brand of peanut butter chips I used. I followed the recipe exactly and chilled the dough before baking, and I did not have any problems with the cookies spreading too much.

this cookie recipe is amazing... reading the reviews i was shocked to see people not trying different ways to make a non spreading cookie. if you live at high altitude, add an extra 1/4 cup of all purpose flour or use the same measurements of self rising flour for a fluffier none spreading cookie :). also u can use a tad more baking soda if you prefer

Tasty...yes....a little flat....yes.....and I even used room temp butter instead of melting it and refrigerated the dough before baking....I just think there is too much butter in this recipe for me, a little greasy. I also used pb and chocolate chips. Thanks for the recipe. May try again and just use 2 sticks of butter instead of 3.

I followed the directions exactly. The first batch took a long time to bake, so I raised the oven temp to 375 for the rest. They turned out like soft baked cookies you get at Subway. Not my favorite, but not as bad as some have said. The person whose cookies spread too much probably didn't preheat the oven long enough.

Wish i had read the reviews before hand. I thought it was strange that the recipe called for melted butter but i followed recipe and melted the butter. NEVER melt butter for cookie recipes. It will cause your cookies to bake up very flat. Leave butter out until it softens. I ended up sticking the cookie dough in the fridge for several hours after my first batch came out very flat. Rest of the bathces baked up beautifully. I should knock a star off for bad directions but these cookies are so yummy- so 5 stars it is!

These were the best cookies I have ever made, and I hardly ever bake.  Appearance and tase wise.  Mine weren't flat at all. I made them about 10 days ago and they STILL are just as soft as the day I made them.  I got rave reviews.  My batch made 33 cookies which were quite large.

I just made these yesterday.  I softened the butter instead of melted it and had no trouble with the cookies being flat.  I even left the batter out for a long time and they still cooked fine.  I added 1/2 teas. more of vanilla.  Next time I think I'm going to try to cut back on the butter by 1/2 cup and maybe use 1/2 brown sugar.  I also used White whole wheat and florida crystals.  We're making them again for sure...everyone loved them.

I found another recipe similar to this because this recipe called for too much sugar. Believe it or not the recipe I found: 3/4 sugar & 3/4 brown sugar was also too much. The faint chocolate taste was there as well but the peanut butter taste was definitely there.
Next time I make these I will double up on the peanut butter, peanut butter cups, peanut butter chips, and cocoa powder and lessen the sugar. 
I also chilled the cookie dough for about two hours and just flattened them down with a spoon while they were hot.

I took other commenters to heart and made the following changes: I used 50/50 real (softened) butter and shortening, 50/50 white sugar and brown sugar, I also did a very scant cup of each sugar, and may reduce a little more next time. Lastly, I doubled the vanilla. The dough comes out perfect! And because of the shortening, it's very easy to roll into perfectly symmetrical balls. My cookies all came out exactly the same shape and size. They also stay chewy if kept in an airtight container. This recipe yielded 5 1/2 dozen small cookies for me.

Made these cookies without any changes to the recipe. Have been using the recipe on the bag of the Reese's Peanut Butter chips for years, but have always been disappointed with the results, as they always turned out flat and without enough chocolate flavor. Found this recipe and was extremely pleased with how thick and chewy they turned out. Will definitely use this recipe in the future.

everyone is saying theirs turned out flat, i followed the recipe exact and got very tough dough, had to squish them with a fork, but they turned out FANTASTIC. Not sure what I might have done differently, but just a tad hard to mix, and a bit heavy, but good.  gunna make them again!

Cookies flatten out a lot. Taste is good presentation is horrible. I even put them in the fridge for a hour.

I followed the recipe but made extra-huge cookies, and just regular chocolate chips instead of peanut butter chips. My cookies turned out perfect. They flattened out gorgeously,  not too thick, and for the size of each cookie it could not have been better.

You can make these and follow the directions and they will fall apart.  I added 1/4 cup oil, 1 1/2 cups flour & just a Tablespoon or two of water then continued following the directions and they were perfection!

These are a nice change of pace from regular chocolate chip and have a cake/brownie like taste.  I did decrease the butter to 1-1/4 cups and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp.  I found the original recipe years ago in an old cookbook (Back of the Box Gourmet) and have made them as cookies or as bars spread in a greased 15x10x1-inch pan.  (Bake about 20 minutes for bars.)  Try if you like chocolate and peanut butter together.

Just made these.  Finished dough looked way too soft to hold cookie shape while baking, so I refrigerated the scooped balls on the pan for about 15 minutes prior to baking.  Still ended up flat as a pancake after 8 minutes.  Flavor is okay, not too sweet, but very greasy.  Wondering if the recipe author meant 1 1/2 STICKS of butter (3/4 c) instead of 1 1/2 cups...?  Butter is too expensive to throw out the remaining cookie dough.  I'll try refrigerating the dough a few hours and see how that works.  Fingers crossed!

I doubled the recipe, but only added 2 1/2 cups of butter and didn't melt it. Cookies were perfectly chewy and didn't spread much.

I most DEFINITELY needed to chill this dough before forming the cookies and baking them, otherwise they DO NOT TURN OUT AT ALL. I definitely usee less butter or add more flour, the cookies are greasy.

This is a good recipe I wish I had peanut butter chips. I melted 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1 cup of butter. they tasted very good. they cam out chewy and rich. I had candy chips and decorated with them. To make a large cookie pat mix into a cake pan and bake about 20-30 minutes or so. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I just made this, and went with Ryan's suggestion of half butter half crisco and using 1 C sugar, 1 C brown sugar, doubling the vanilla,
didn't spread, chewiest, well formed cookies i've made, but next time i'll lessen the crisco to 1/2 or maybe less and the butter to 1 C.. for the fact it gave it a very strong flavor, that I didn't really care for..at all
I also refrigerated my cookies for 1 hour before cooking.

Good cookie with a rich wonderful taste but it flattens out way too much. Would be bester if it keep more of it height but all in all it's still worth making.

I have been making these for years and they are THE best cookie ever!!  Use real butter if you don't want them to be flat.  I usually put some of the dough in the fridge, never make all the cookies at once.  I LOVE them!

Just baked my first sheet of these cookies and they are dee-lish! I used my mixer until just the flour mixture was just folded in, then added the peanut butter chips and stirred a couple times by hand.  The secret to cookies not flattening out is to NOT over-mix the dough.  These are simple and tasty!

Cookies were awesome. Since butter is sooo expensive, can margarine be substituted in the recipe? I plan on just creaming the sugar and margarine...not melting it.

Just made these delicious cookies and they are awesome !! I found out that before I added the chips the dough was a bit watery so I did add about 1/2 cup more of flour .. They came out great and I dont even like peanut butter and chocolate mixed but these were awesome !! Thanks :)

Tried this recipe for the first time and made some changes based off of reviews. I used half butter half shortening, one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar. I also didnt melt my butter I softened it to room temp but thats it. Had no problems. I thought the batter was to thick but after cooking them they turned out perfect!! And 8 minutes worked perfectly for me.

I tried this recipe for the first time and brought it to work with me - I had a lot of happy takers. Very moist, chewy, and delicious. I didn't have trouble with consistency after cooking, but I did add about 1/8 - 1/4 cup of extra flour just to make the dough a little stiffer. Will definitely add this too my Christmas cookie trays next year.

This is a great recipe!  I like to add about 1/2 cup of extra cocoa, because I am a chocolate fanatic.  

For those complaining that the cookies spread out too much while baking, the solution is simple - just don't melt the butter.  Leave it at room temperature and cream it with the sugar, making sure they combine to a light and fluffy consistency before adding the rest of the ingredients.  You can also chill the dough before baking, as others have suggested.  When I make this recipe, the cookies hold their shape while baking.

I loved the taste, however even after adding extra flour they were flat as pancakes.  Also, I had a heck of a time getting them off the cookie sheet.

This is my family's new favorite cookie and that is saying alot because I can make some good cookies. I used Reese's Peanut Butter chips and this recipe is almost identical to that on the bag. I used tablespoon sized drops rather then the teaspoon size and was still able to get 5 1/2 dozen.

Excellent recipe! Soft, chewy cookies.  As one reviewer said, chill the dough for an hour and you'll have perfect cookies!  Do not over bake!

I made these cookies for my boyfriend with intentions that they just are going to taste like all the other dried out chocolate peanut butter chip cookies that I've had. I'm always disappointed but he loves chocolate and peanut butter. Anyway for my future reference I'm writing notes for myself and hopefully may help some of you. After a few hours I decided I'd try one because I broke it, AND WOWWWW!!! I ran right over to the computer to rate these!!! I'm Completely impressed!  I used half butter and half crisco. I used 1 cup packed brown sugar (for chewiness) and 1 cup white sugar. Placed 9 staggered on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, because they will spread out a little and I don't like when they bake into each other. They are pretty sweet and that's good because I won't eat too many :)   thank you thank you for this recipe!!!!

I always read reviews before I make a new recipe, and I'm glad I did for these. I took some of the suggestions to save them from being "pancake" cookies. I added the extra tablespoon of flour, and I used softened butter instead of melted, and they came out perfectly. I shared them with my roommates, and they were a huge hit. Chewy with a tiny outside crunch, they were the perfect cookie.

These cookies are good.  To me they need more chocolate.  I am going to experiment with the recipe to see if I can make them more chocolatly.  For those who have had a problem with them spreading and flat try not melting the butter just getting the butter very soft.

I halved the recipe due to there are only so many cookies 2 people should eat.  We really enjoyed them they did stay chewy.  I also froze them in tin foil so we could keep enjoying them from time to time..  Next time I would make the whole batch they froze perfectly and where just as good a week later.  If you eat them frozen they taste like the corner piece of brownies. (my favorite part)

Is the butter supposed to be melted first? I did, and I got the results everyone else is talking about. I baked them for the full 10 minutes and they still hadn't set. I let them sit to cool for 15 minutes and they were still doughy/gooey. They taste delicious, but I won't be making them again.

I added about 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter instead of the chips, and ended up making cookie bars, for the dough was not thick enough, but it ended up really chewy and delicious. Not to sweet nor rich, but just that sweet tooth necessity! :D

Okay, I changed a few things. I used 1 stick of Crisco shortening, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla. I used my #50 cookie scoop (made 44 cookies), flattened slightly and baked @350 for 10minutes......Wonderful!

Very yummy!  However, after the 2nd day, even when stored in a tight container and a piece of bread thrown in to combat drying, they still were dry.  Tip: throw them in the microwave for 15 seconds and YUM YUM YUM!!

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening as I only had one cup of butter left; I also did a mix half white sugar and half brown sugar.  This is the recipe I have been searching for!

These are very good. I didn't melt the butter and then I refrigerated the dough for about an hour. This helped the dough be easier to handle and the cookies were not very thin nor did they spread to much. I will make again.

I thought these were great. I did have a bit of a problem with them falling apart after cooking. They wouldn't hold together. The last pan I left them in for 14 min. but those were too crunchy. Just the way my DH likes them though. I thought they tasted like brownies. Easy and delicious.

We used a milk chocolate/peanut butter chip mix and it made them really rich!  They do come out really flat and we even put them in the fridge for 2 hours before we baked them. If you do fridge them that long they take about 12 mins to bake. Super tase and decadent!

These were pretty good but I agree with the other reviews, don't melt the butter and stick the cookie dough in the fridge for a bit before cooking.

These were great! I used half whole wheat flour and regular flour; I also used half "raw" sugar and half regular sugar. I used some white choc. chips, peanut butter chip, and of course regular choc. chips.

I made a few small changes to this recipe, after reading some of the other reviews. First, I didn't melt the butter, just softened it. I also replaced 1/2 cup of butter with shortening as it seemed like a lot of people complained about the cookies spreading. Then I replaced half of the white sugar with light brown sugar. One last thing...I had butterscotch chips on hand, instead of peanut butter ones. Anyway, the cookies did not spread and were nice and chewy with a great rich chocolate flavor.

I did make some changes, though. If you do make these cookies, I recommend not melting the butter. 
Everyone who tried them like them, though, and I certainly have no complaints! =D

I have to rate these kind of medium.  They taste pretty good but they look terrible. They spread out and are very thin.  I didn't melt the butter all the way and even put the dough in the freezer and they still spread.  I think adding more flour, using less butter and putting in some baking powder might help.

These were the best tasting cookies ever...but the worst to make. The dough was to mushy so I stuck in freezer but they flattened out when baking and  after cooling they crumpled up in little pieces I'm not sure what happened but worth figuring out.

Tasted great, but they do spread too much.  Maybe chill as one reviewer said or less butter and more chips?

very soft and chewy. Thought that 1-1/2 cups of butter seemed like alot, but they turned out great. Very easy to put together.

I made these to send to my husband in Iraq. He loves peanut butter chips, and I can't really think of a better combination than peanut butter and chocolate. I upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup just cause I felt like it. They were pretty crumbly, but the taste was great. Hubby actually hid them from his buddies so he wouldn't have to share them!

Absolutely delish.  The boys here approve!  I did take out 1-2 mins before they were done and let them sit before transferring.  
Definite keeper in the cookie rotation!

As another reviewer suggested, I chilled the dough for an hour.  I put them in the oven for 10 minutes, which was too long and the bottoms burned. The next batch went in for 8 minutes and were perfect!  (of course it depends on your oven).  Everyone loved them, though, despite being burned a little :O)!

its a good recipe, but they're best eaten right out of the oven, if you let them sit for any extended amount of time they become hardened, but still taste wonderful.

I usually use 2 teaspoons of vanilla and a little less butter and these always turn out great.

These cookies were GREAT!  I read the other reviews before I made them so I was prepared when the thinned out while baking, but they were still the most popular item at the party. Thank you!!

I'll give this 4 stars for taste. But I must say that these cookies weren't very visually appealing (I was immediately reminded of "cow pies").
I, too, experienced the "spreading" problem, since the cookies bake so flat, but I'm not an experienced cookie-baker yet. And I really should get some wire racks, they would've come in handy for cooling the cookies.
Overall, this was very easy to make, and very tasty. I might try that "chill the dough for an hour" trick a previous reviewer mentioned, if I make this again.

Mine spread out a lot on the baking pan, that may have been due to the amount of butter but they looked decent at the end ... and the taste!!! They tasted just like peanut butter cups.

As others have said, these can bake a little flat sometimes.  *But* this has been my favorite cookie recipe since I first made it last spring for some friends.  Everyone that's ever tried them has loved them, and one in particular who isn't a big sweets fan said, "This is the best cookie I've had in a long time."  Very addictive.  They're still soft and chewy days after they're made.
