Not worth the time buying the ingredients, much less the prep & cook time.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I substituted the Half and Half and used a can of reduced calerie cream of asparagus (or cream of chicken) soup and 2% shredded cheese. I also used the spinach feticcine. I was great.

This was absolutely AMAZING!!! I made it for my family one night and they absolutely loved it including the kids. I used regular half and half cream instead and I used just regular cheddar cheese. I didn't use the crab but I put in a bunch of little shrimp and I cut up some scallops and put them in too. I didn't use the squid ink pasta but I made a bunch of my own fresh linguini. Although a biit fattening I would recommend this for any seafood and pasta lover!

I love this recipe.  I make it whenever I am in the mood for alfredo.  I do not use the squid ink pasta though.  I also will buy the crab meat that is in the can near the tuna fish.  It is not the same but saves some money.  I have also added clams or shrimp to it at times.

It was good!  I added 2x as much parmesan cheese and used leftover salmon and some shrimp from the freezer.  Easily serves 8.  Will make this again, thanks, Sara!

Absolutely Amazing.  The only things I did differently was using regular half anf half (it was all I had in the house) and real crab meat (it cost me fifty cents more for the real claw meat than it would have for imitation.)  It was absolutely divine.  I will be makeing this a hundred times over with a variety of proteins.

We are really happy with this meal. It's fast, easy and very good. I have had black squid ink pasta and never plan to. It's good with any rice or pasta.

The crab is thick and ruins the sauce.

Thank you for sharing this SARA_NO_H! I found it by searching for the ingredients I had on hand, so I was forced to alter it a bit, but it was quick, easy and delicious!

Great recipe that can be used as a base for many different variations on the same dish. You can add any kind of seafood, vegetables, etc. you want and this will still taste good. I like it with steamed broccoli and shrimp or, if it's in season, shredded lobster meat.
