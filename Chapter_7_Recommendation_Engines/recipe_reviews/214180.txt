Three stars as is, five with the following adjustments:  zest of one entire orange, subbed the water for orange juice that I squeezed from the orange I zested, one more garlic clove, no tomato, add toasted sesame seeds and toasted slivered almonds.  Delicious with these adjustments!

I used frozen haricort vert instead of fresh it it was very tasty. The only part that didn't work for me was the tomato. It kind of got lost.  I think the dish needed a bit of a different texture so next time I'll drop the tomato and add some toasted sliced almonds

Did not have fresh garlic so I used garlic salt.  Everybody loved the recipe.  Great way to use up all green beans from the garden

Great recipe if you follow the times given. I added some water chestnuts and they took on the taste of the orange zest, a very nice addition.

Tried Craisins as substitute for tomato, nice mix with orange zest.  My sister in law did same, added almonds.  Have to be cognizant of nut allergies, though...

Did it on a week night and it was fabulous. The changes I made were..... Steamed the green beans and a few cauliflower florets. cut down the honey from 3 tbsps to 1 tbsp and added the juice of the zested Orange instead of water. Also added a pinch of chilli powder as I wanted a hint of heat. I also added a tsp of persimmon juice which I had reduced to a thick jam. Wow that lifted the dish to a sublime level. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Lovely. Do not think this would be enough for four servings, unless I misunderstand what two cups meant. Used a beautiful heirloom tomato...think it needed something that I couldn't put my finger on, that would take these to 5 stars...maybe some sugar.

I had green beans from our CSA and tomatoes from the farmers market.  It was really good. I did fine the beans to be a bit chewy with the recommended cooking times. Pretty good!
