These are great for breakfast - I used fat free vanilla yogurt, grape nuts and fresh strawberries along with the strawberry preserves.

My kids and I had so much fun making this for dessert tonight! It was so delicious! I left out the strawberry preserves and used fresh strawberries instead. I set all the ingredients out on the table and everyone made their own layered parfait (sliced strawberries, vanilla yogurt, mixed berries then a dollop of whipped cream and some granola (and sprinkles) on the top!) A very nice and light dessert to eat in the middle of the week!

Sorry Smuckers, I used a lite strawberry spread I buy from Aldi;)  All in all this was good but my ingredients weren't cold enough, my layering wasn't appealing to look at.   It tasted good, none-the-less.  I'm not particularly fond of adding jelly to my desserts so I will most likely omit that next time.

Quick treat for me when I got home tonight from work. I used my own strawberry-banana freezer jam, homemade granola and fresh chopped strawberries. VERY good.

Excellent light breakfast. I used simply fruit spread instead, honey bunches of oats vanilla granola cereal, and a mix of sliced strawberries and blueberries. A little dollop of Cool Whip was all I needed to add at the end to make this perfect. Thanks!

This was one of the best breakfast treats I have had in a while. I had some plain yogurt to use up, so added regular strawberry jam to that, used blueberries, and Kellog's Strawberry Medley for the cereal.  So yummy!

At first I did not like plain yogurt, but its pretty good after I added in the strawberry preserves. I used the smuckers simply fruit strawberry with plain yogurt, and then I added in some bare naked fruit and nut granola, strawberries, and blueberries.
