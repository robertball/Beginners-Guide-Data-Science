my results came out rather messy looking. the 1 tsp of caramel looked too much for the mini oreos, and went dripping down the side. (unlike the beautiful picture). i recommend doing 1/2 tsp first, and then another 1/2 so it doesn't drip as much, so that half of it gets to harden. this was a super sweet dessert =)

Great recipe!  So easy and so beautiful too!  I also did not use so many caramels and only 1/2 tsp of caramel is enough. I also sprinkled crushed toffee bits on top too, and they are amazing.  But warning, it is physically possible only to eat ONE.  Lots of milk!!

I made these for a little get together with friends and everyone ate them up!  They were a great party hit.
