My folks went charter fishing in Alaska and brought home a freezer full of halibut steaks.  My mom bought a halibut cookbook, but they were all so-so.  I tried this recipe for my family in lieu of all of the heavy dill, butter, and cream-based sauces.  At first my highly traditional parents frowned at it ("you made salsa with peaches AND you want us to put that stuff on our fish?!").  One bite changed that!  They went back for seconds and thirds until all the fish was gone.  Then my father found some tortilla chips and polished off the rest of the salsa.  This is the way we prefer our halibut now!

Very good! I didn't have a grill so I had to bake mine. It took about 15 minutes or less on 350F. The fish was tender and delicately flavored. The salsa was a great compliment, and tasty on its own! Could be a star for fish tacos.

Mmm.  The peach salsa is so good.  I added a couple of garden tomatoes to it, but it would have been delightful without them.  I used salmon instead of halibut (the salmon was fresh, the halibut frozen--I needed to use that fresh fish).  I just marinated it with all the marinade for, oh, maybe three hours.  Then I plank grilled it (yum).  The marinade is great--tasty, but not overpowering.  I sent my husband with the leftovers on a bed of lettuce in his lunch today.  Very good.

I only made the salsa portion of the recipe and served it with Hawaiian quesadillas (cheese, canadian bacon and pineapple).  This was a HUGE hit, and people were putting the salsa on chips, crackers and anything else that was out for appetizers!  The quesadillas and the salsa were gone within 10 minutes!

Just absolutely outstanding. I made this recipe exactly as written and it has that "wow" factor even though it's not difficult at all to make. The salsa would be good over dirt, it's that good. Thank you.

I don't have any fish right now, but had fresh peaches that needed to be used. This salsa is fantastic! I'm going to heat up some grilled chicken from yesterday & have it with this salsa.

I love fish- slathered in tartar sauce and fried to oblivion- so that you can't taste the fish. Fish is not a favorite of mine. However, since mayo and a deep fryer do not a healthy dish make, I am trying other options. This recipe was easy and (surprisingly) very tasty. The ONLY reason I gave it four stars is I can't give it 4.5, and the salsa is a little bland. It tasted like peaches with onions- not really a salsa. I added a little red pepper, some hot sauce and the extra I would highly recommend: some Thai sweet chilli paste- sweet with a little spice.I also added some of the reserved marinade.  Next time I'll try putting the peaches on the grill while cooking the fish for a little more depth. But even if you don't do anything different- this is a great healthy way to get fish into your diet. Without mayo and a Fry-Daddy.

I love this recipe, it has become one of my standard summer bbq recipes.  I've tried many variations on it, depending on ingredients available.  I now prefer this dish with salmon instead of halibut (although the halibut is still delicious).  The salsa also works well with mangos or necterines (nice to have options when looking for ripe fruit). It also works very well on top of a lettuce salad tossed in a citrus vinegrette.

I used orange roughy since my grocery store didn't have halibut at the time and it was delicious.  The peach salsa really adds a great flavor.

I was a little weary of the fruit fish combo at first but it was so yummy and its a great way to do fish!  The fish is great alone and so is the salsa.  A true sign of a great recipe.  We also tried them as fish tacos which was good but I think I preferred it the original way.

This turned out really good and was very easy, will make again.  The peach and cilantro and halibut go really well together.

This was AWESOME!!!  I used all jalapeno for the pepper part, but it would have been prettier with the red pepper though!  Definitely let it all sit in the frige for several hours for the flavors to mingle.  

I did the fish in the oven this time, but will grill next time.  This would make awesome fish tacos too, just sayin!

I made this recipe into tacos and it was delicious!!! I fried small corn tortillas in a small amount of oil until crisp and placed the fish, salsa, and some crumbled feta cheese in them. YUMMY!

I made this so I could use up some sweet summer Georgia Peaches and it turned out fantastic. The peach salsa was outstanding with just the right blend of flavors. The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup of peach preserves to the basting sauce to give it a bit more peach flavor. Delicious. Thanks for sharing!

We loved this recipe!  I used haddock only because that is what I had at the time.  Any white fish would do:  halibut, haddock, cod, tilapia, etc.  The salsa was so refreshing and tasty!  I served the fish with some whole grain rice and the salsa was a nice topper to that as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

OMG, this fish is delicious! My children loved this dish as much as my husband and I did! We used frozen peaches instead of fresh because they're not in season, and even the tartness of the fruit was a good contrast to the yummy fish. I can only imagine how much better it would be with in-season fruit. With the leftover bell pepper and onion, I put them on skewers, brushed them with oil and roasted them at 450 degrees for 25 minutes. Served it all over rice. My husband rated this one of my top 5 dinners!

I made the salsa and it was delicious and fresh with the fish.  The jalapeno pepper was a little too spicy for me so I think next time I'd put a little less than that, but that is just personal preference.  My guests loved the heat!

The salsa was fantastic as a stand alone item, but went very poorly with the marinated fish.  Also the fish needed to marinate at least overnight b/c by 2 hours the fish had not soaked up any flavor.

This was delicious!! I prepared the marinade as directed and let the fish soak for double the time suggested, as a few people said they couldn't taste the marinade after the fish had cooked. I also added mango to the salsa and left out the red pepper. A fairly easy preparation for a FABULOUS end result!

This is really delicious!  I wouldn't change a single thing!  You could change the amounts of the salsa ingredients (ie, more cilantro, more onion, etc) but you don't have to!  This was very good!

The fish was delicious and had a very unique and fresh taste.  I made a pretty big change so i'm not sure how much my rating applies, but i think the idea remained the same.  I used apples instead of peaches and apple cider instead of orange juice. Also i baked the fish with the marinade.  Overall it is definitely a great alternative to all the cream and butter based sauces.

The salsa is absolutely fantastic! I trusted my gut instincts and all the prior reviews and made a double batch so that I would have more this week for over top chicken and tuna steaks. So glad that I did this! (I'm eating the salsa over grilled tuna steaks as I type!!). This is a fantastic condiment and super light prep. for the summer. I used a fish called amberjack instead of the halibut which is similar to mahi mahi and it was just super tender, flaky and flavorful. I am looking forward to seeing what else this is fantastic on!

I prepared this exactly as described with the exception of the jalapeno peppers which I left out.  It turned out DELICIOUS! Even my two year old ate every bite.  The fish is so flavorful, even without the salsa.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Don't change a thing!  I'll make this for company for sure.  One of our friends is a gourmet chef who owns the most successful french restaurant in town so needless to say, I'm always nervous about what to serve when he comes for dinner.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this for him.

Delicious on a warm summer evening. Refreshing, light, hint of citrus. Made a healthy sauteed spinach with sliced almonds and a sliced garlic clove for the side.

Excellent...I can't think of a thing I'd change about this recipe. I did use catfish instead of halibut, but kept everything else the same...I think the marinade would also be great for making grilled fish tacos!

I made only the salsa portion of this recipe and served it over tilapia.  It was very good and very colorful!  I used one can of peaches, drained and used some of the peach juice because I didn't have orange juice.  I made the salsa up early in the day and left it at room temperature.  Then microwaved it for a minute to warm it up a bit before topping the fish.  Hubby and I both enjoyed this one!

Bland!  I think there are much better ways to cook halibut that make for a delicious meal.  This recipe had little to no flavor and left me feeling like I  was eating fish that had not been seasoned or marinated.

This was delicious.  I found out that halibut is not my favorite type of fish though.  I used habanero and jalapeno peppers in the salsa and regretted that because it was way too spicy.  If I make this again, I will follow the recipe exactly.

although the peach salsa was very good the halibut was lacking flavor. next time I may try marinating longer or reducing the thickness of the halibut fillets.

Made this dish tonight, and Costco didn't have any Halibut, so I substituted Sea Bass instead......this was delicious!  I didn't alter the recipe at all, other than not marinating the fish for as long as the recipe called for.  Will make again, hopefully next time I'll be able to find Halibut.

This was great.  I cooked this for a household of men and it went very quickly.  I used haddock instead of halibut, and baked the haddock at 400 F for 35 minutes and it was perfect.  The peach salsa was a huge hit as well.  

Thank you.

Holy smokes! Unbelievable salsa! This made the absolutely best summer grilled meal I have had in a while! I served this over salmon and chicken (halibut is my favorite fish but was super expensive) and slightly preferred the chicken. I bet if this was served over halibut it would be about a 10 star meal!

We liked this recipe. I didn't have a grill, so I had to bake the fish and I was pleasantly surprised that my fish had a nice citrus flavor. The salsa was delicious, fruity and refreshing. It goes well on anything.

This dish was fantastic!!! I would truly give more than 5 stars if possible. I only marinated the fish for 1 hour and even then it was very flavorful. Other than that, I didn't make any change to this dish. I'm glad I had some leftovers of the salsa for the next day, so I could have some with chips.

I chose this recipe because I bought a box of ripe peaches straight from the farm. I grilled the halibut, but had to use fillets as there weren't any halibut steaks at the store. The peach salsa was amazing. The halibut and peaches combine to make a very delicate taste, and the citrus and red onion in the salsa give a nice kick. I served the fish and salsa with rice; it made a colorful plate and a tasty summer dinner.

WOW!!! This was my first time to try Halibut and that was a treat in itself! YUM! And, at 9.99 for a 6oz. portion (on sale at Publix) I really needed this to be amazing and it was! An amazing meal with NO GUILT!! I was excited to use perfect fresh Elberta peaches in the salsa and it was wonderful and made the dish very special- just as written- why mess with perfection!!

I've made this three times now.  The first was best because the peaches were in season and ripe.  I used the recipe with salmon, it is hard to get halibut here.  We loved the extra salsa with tortilla chips so made just the salsa another time as an appetizer.  Everyone loved it.  The third time the peaches were not as ripened and it was not as good.

Did not get too fussy on measuring ingredients for the salsa. Used 2 jalapenos instead of 1 and pureed 2 avacados with the orange and lime juice making sort of a paste and mixed that into the vegetable mixture and it is the best salsa I have ever had.

This recipe is awesome. I used Halibut Fillets and instead of making the peach salsa, I used the Mango Peach salsa from Costco. Delicious!!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was easy to make and the peach salsa was delicious.  The only substitution I made was that I used halibut fillets instead of steaks (cheaper that way).

Loved it! I liked the fish better without the salsa and added chopped jalapeno (mild) on top. It has an excellent flavor, my husband loved it and my 4 year old had seconds. It will be made again.

I made this using mahi mahi. I baked it with the extra marinade and then poured the cooked juiced over rice and my fish before topping it off with the salsa. I loved the flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic flavor.  The peach salsa complimented the halibut beautifully.  Fresh peaches are the best to use.  I did try using canned, but have decided fresh is the only way to go.

I made this with skinless chicken breasts and it came out perfect.  The Salsa is the perfect accompaniment with the meat. I used 6 peaches off our tree.  This is a keeper.

Easy and absolutely delicious!! The salsa looks so nice and colorful on the fish and it was so yummy. We made this dish with salmon instead of halibut and it turned out great. Also added a little cayenne red pepper to the salsa for an extra small kick. We made this for a dinner party and the guests were very impressed.

Just last summer I bought a box of peaches from a fruit stand for a great price and I needed some ideas on how to use all of these peaches. I came across this recipe and it was excellent. My whole family raved about this recipe and always ask me to make it again. I am not a fish fan but this recipe was so good I couldn't help but love it. Thank you.

I made this for my parents when they were visiting.  I don't care for fish, so I had the peach salsa on a chicken breast.  Oh my goodness, it was delicious.  I couldn't stop eating it.

Only made the salsa... and served with grilled salmon.  It was an wonderful way to use up the 2 nectarines in my fridge that weren't quite ripe enough to eat alone, but getting too bruised to keep much longer.  YUM!

I used fresh peaches and added fresh grated ginger to both the marinade and the salsa.  I used this on ahi.  I made a salad with fresh herbs, dressed with white balsamic, lime and olive oil.  Flash cooked the ahi,leaving it vey rare.  I sliced it in thin slices and placed over the herb salad.  I placed the salsa on top.  It was so beautiful, my guest had to take a picture. It was excellent!!  This will be a new staple in my house.

I loved this. I used my stove top grill pan and it worked great. I used Basa Swai fish since this was on sale this week and it was yummy.

Halibut is delicate.  Use other fish like Tilapia, Orange Roughy.  Needs just a little more lemon to make the recipe snappier.  Works very well with chicken, too.  Bake in a casserole covered with aluminum foil for 15 minutes, then remove for the finish.

This was a hit!  I didn't have halibut, so I used orange roughy.  My picky-eater nephew asked for seconds.  My kids loved it, and hubby thought it was one of the best meals I had fixed.

Very good. Fish was a bit bland, so next time might add some cilantro to the marinade. We ended up cutting the fish up after grilling and putting in tortillas with the salsa, but son ate it with just the salsa on top. Both ways were very good.

Made salsa only. Not bad. Probably good with Jamaican Jerk Chicken
