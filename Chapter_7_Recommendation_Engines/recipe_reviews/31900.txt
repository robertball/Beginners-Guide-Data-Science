I don't know where this recipe comes from with all due respect. Some of these ingredients are outrageous. I'll try  it though and report back. Good luck to everyone.

My mother used to make this but would use a pork roast or butt, never feet or tongue. To the meat she would add olives with pimento, capers, pickles, lemon slices on top. She would refrigerate it and then slice and serve on rye bread.
