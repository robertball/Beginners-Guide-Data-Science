We live in Mobile,Al. and this is the standard gumbo recipe around here-GREAT- but,PERSONALLY, I don't use the oysters and not as much okra-just my preference.

It will have to be a really cold day before I whisk flour and clarified butter for 45 minutes.  Great gumbo--even leaving out the seafood.

I only put half a can of tomato paste, you really dont want it tasting like a bowl of pasta. I also did 2 tablespoons of old bay seasoning and 2 tablespoons of gumbo file. I also added hot links and chicken pieces to make it a hearty gumbo. More ingredients is better than less. This really was a good starter receipt for gumbo.

This recipe is TOUGH!  I used 1/2 the okra and 1/2 of the tomato paste, and it was still had a lot of okra, and it seemed like a very thick tomato soup.  It was delicious with just shrimp, but could be watered down a lot and still be delish.  Great recipe overall, but not worth the time, effort, and injury that went into it.  Warning to others who have never made gumbo - it cooks VERY HOT, so I recommend wearing rubber kitchen gloves when you mix in the broth to avoid serious burns!

I was extremely disppointed in this recipe.  It was too thick and the seafood was hardly discernable.  The flavor was not particularly good although it was better the second day.  I will not be using this recipe again!

The tough part was clarifying the butter and whisking the roux, but after that hurdle it was a breeze! My family loved the gumbo. It has lots of flavor but is not overpowering or too spicy. The directions were spot=on, too.

I think I just made tomato gravy, y'all.  I am down to letting it simmer for 1 hour and it looks like pasta sauce, but taste like tomato gravy.  Can someone please tell me what went wrong?

Added 2 cups of water and 2 cups chicken broth to thin out a bit. Used catfish and andouille sausage instead of other seafood. Added poblano peppers to vegie mix. Needs more vegies, next time I will double. Heat was weak, but I like it hot. Overall really good but make sure you have about 3 hours to cook.

I changed it a bit to suit my taste. I left out the tomato paste and put in extra diced tomatoes.  I also added celery, Tony Chacheres creole seasoning, and gumbo file. Instead of the oysters, shrimp, and crab, I put in a pack of frozen crawfish tails, and andouille sausage.

I've had Mobile gumbo & it's not like any I've ever had. Too much like thick tomato soup. I like it more brown than red & not so thick. If I ever use this recipe again ,way less flour & tomato paste. More okra though :-)
