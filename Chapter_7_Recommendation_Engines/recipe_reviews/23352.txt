I too modified this recipe and actually got an idea or two from another allrecipe entry "Cabbage Jambalaya."  Along with the onion and meat, I added two chopped garlic cloves.  I used one can of tomato soup and 1 can of tomato sauce that had the Italian spices in it.  In addition, I put in about 1/2 teaspoon each of Italian seasons, basil and oregano.  I also added one cup of minute rice when I added in the tomatoes.  With these changes we had a most excellent meal--both my husband and daughter went back for seconds!

My husband loved this recipe, he called it "a definite keeper". Of course the kids wouldn't go near it, but what kid screams for cabbage??? I added salt, pepper, thyme and a bayleaf. Without the addition of these spices, I think it would have been a little bland. Served it over rice, and it was excellent!! Even better the next day. And much easier than rolling all that cabbage!!

This turned out quite well.  I did change a few things.  I took heed of others advice....I added 1 can of tomato sauce, omitted 1 can of soup.  I added seasoning..it needed it, I think.(Basil, oregano, garlic).  I also did NOT add the sour cream.  I didn't think it needed it.  I also added one small can of tomato paste.  
My kids, both of whom had never eaten cabbage before, said they loved it.  So, that is a good sign!!!  I will make this again.  The pot was huge...I had enough for leftovers!!!!  Wooooohooooooo!!

This was much easier than making cabbage rolls and tasted pretty close to the real thing. I also used one can of diced tomatoes instead of one of the cans of soup. I put white rice in the bottom of a soup bowl and put the cabbage mixture on top. We also sprinkled with parm cheese. The next day for lunch we mixed the rice and cabbage mixture together and re-heated...even better the next day! Great alternative to cabbage rolls when you don't want to do all the work.

What a GREAT idea!  I've been making cabbage rolls for years, but never thought to make them this way.  It's sooooo much easier!....  I made a few changes to the recipe and it came out tasting almost exactly like my regular cabbage rolls.  Here are the changes I made: I used 1-1/2 pounds of ground beef to make it a little meatier.  I used 1 (15.2 oz "value size") can of tomato soup, 1 (15 oz) can of tomato sauce and NO water.  I also added a can of drained diced tomatoes.  I boiled the sliced cabbage for about 5 minutes before adding it to the meat/onion/tomato mixture to help speed up the cooking time (and to help it all fit in my electric skillet).  For seasonings I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I didn't add the sour cream.  I had some leftover cooked rice in the fridge, so right before serving I stirred in about a cup of that and heated it through.  YUM!

Turned out more like a soup and I needed to add extra spices. I enjoyed it and will make it again, my husband wasn't crazy about it. It did freeze well.

I made this today, and loved it.  I'm counting points and this is a great low-fat recipe.  I used 93% lean, added italian seasoning, used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, one can of soup and substituted the sour cream for non-fat yogurt.  Again, this turned out great, but it does take at least an hour to soften the cabbage.  Served over rice.

I love cabbage rolls but not the work so, that being said, I like this recipe very much.  A couple of things . . .  I doubled the meat and the tomato soup, did not use the sour cream.  Without doubling the meat, it was too much like soup.  The only real problem is that the cabbage takes much longer to cook than the recipe calls for - it took at least an hour of simmering to get the cabbage tender enough.  All-in-all, a very easy and tasty recipe.  Thank you.

My husband loved this recipe.  He said it tasted like his mom's cabbage rolls (with a lot less work).  Instead of serving with rice I added the rice to the recipe and used tomato sauce instead of soup.  I also increased the sauce a little since I added the rice.  My family has asked for this again already.

This was alright but I added an extra can of diced tomatoes & a can of tomato sauce 8oz, to that I added 3 TbSP of brown sugar, 2 TBSP worcheshire sauce, & 3 tsp lemon juice came out more like real cabbage rolls.

This was much easier than making cabbage rolls and tasted pretty close to the real thing...aka..my grandmother's! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I also made a side of white rice since my grandma's has rice added into her cabbage rolls. I put the white rice in the bottom of a soup bowl and put the cabbage mixture on top. I think I will add a bit of garlic next time, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing! Great alternative to cabbage rolls when you don't want to do all the work. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Right up my alley! This was awesome with some alterations. I used a can of tomatoes instead of one of the cans of tomato soup. I also added a can of tomato paste flavored with basil, oregano and garlic. I used four, chopped garlic cloves to flavor the beef, along with a helping of basil and oregano. This was awesome. I love cabbage (cooked), period... Sour cream is another favorite of mine. OUTSTANDING! Couldn't ask for more.

I made my own modifications to this dish.  First of all, after draining the beef/onion mix, I added the cabbage to the pan w/the beef onion mix and fried it for a few minutes before adding the tomato soup.  Then, instead of the 2 cans of regular tomato soup I added 1 can of tomato w/rice soup and 1 can of roasted garlic tomato paste w/only 1 tomato paste can of water and finished cooking it.  This made it thick, not soupy, which I like better.  I didn't add the sour cream, I think it's great w/o it.

I used to cook something like this, but without tomato sauce and adding rice already to the mixture. this time I tried it out like CarolynT advises except the tomato sauce and it was very good, although it definitely needed some more spices added for more taste. thanks for new ideas :)

I was looking for the quickest recipe using on-hand ingredients matching the South Beach diet, and ran across this. Tasted O.K. by the recipe, then I ran to read the reviews for a little help. Lots of cajun spices and garlic salt really gave this some flavor. I think it would even be good without sour cream, to save calories. ...I have since made this without the beef, just throwing in chopped up pre-cooked smoked sausage instead. Great alteration if you're in a rush!

This was very good. I made a couple of changes based on what I had and other reviews. I had spaghetti sauce to use up so I used that rather than tomato soup. I also added two cans of diced tomatoes. Next time I will use the tomato soup along with at least two cans of diced tomatos. 
I used ground turkey and next time I will use 2lbs of ground turkey or1lb ground turkey & 1lb ground sausage. I thought more meat was needed but that could be because of extra ingredients I added. Along with browning the ground turkey I added minced garlic and diced green pepper. Spices I added were garlic powder, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, fennel and crushed red peppers.
After the cabbage was fully cooked I added cooked brown rice. I used the sour cream but I am not sure what it really added to the overall taste so next time I will leave it out. Sprinkled parmesan cheese on top before serving.
I wasn't sure what my husband would think of this but he really liked it and got seconds. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty, hearty and healthy. My stepdad, who was sure he wouldn't like it, ended up asking me to make it again as soon as possible. I only changed a few things - I added dried basil and parsley in a 2 to 1 ratio (about a tablespoon or so of basil). I also used two cans of tomato soup that weren't concentrated, and two cans of petite diced tomatoes. I simmered for an hour and added cooked brown rice at the end. The sour cream was a GREAT touch. When I served my boyfriend he actually asked for sour cream and I got to tell him it was already in there. :) I let everyone add their own hot sauce to taste. SO YUMMY! I'm making another pot of it right now and can't wait to dig in.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I make it almost weekly even though I'm the only one in the house who will touch it.

I add whatever left over meat I happen to have from dinners (like today when I used left over taco meat).

I usually use egg noodles or elbow macaroni, and I add extra soup because I like mine soup consistency.

Whatever you do, don't skip the sour cream. It really makes the dish.

I made this recipe and the only thing I added was baking time. I placed it in a baking dish and baked it in the oven for 30 minutes. It was a yummy way to eat the time consuming original cabbage rolls with less work. It also reheats real well. Put into individual servings and freeze them. VOILA! Lunch on the go.

We doubled this recipe since there are 6 of us and found out quickly that we didn't need to as that made a lot!  We did as others suggested and did half the tomato soup and the other half was tomato sauce.  We also made the rice in with the dish, and added a few spices (Italian seasoning, parsley, etc).  The rice was brown rice and it took a long time for it to get soft, and for the cabbage to soften - probably about an hour.  It was starting to burn at the bottom of the pot because I wasn't stirring well enough so definitely need to watch that too.  We'll make again, for certain!

My family loves stuffed cabbage, but I don't have much time to make it.  This recipe "hit the spot" by adding 1/2 to 3/4 cup of brown sugar and omitting the sour cream.  We served it over rice, but I'd like to try adding the rice and extra water directly to the other ingredients and cooking it all at once!  I imagine it could even be done with noodles the same way.  Next time!

It was so easy!! I added some extras to the meat (eggs, garlic powder and cooked white rice) and combined ground pork and ground beef because I wanted to use some leftovers. It still turned out better than the "real" cabbage rolls I made. I will be making this again.

I had some leftover ground pork that I needed to use and I so happened to have both cabbage and tomato soup also so I made this and I LOVE it!!! I kinda think it's like cabbage chili; very hearty and delicious! I only had one tomato soup so I also used diced tomatoes. I also seasoned w/ Italian seasoning and a little bit of chicken bouillon.  I served this over some wild rice, Parmesan cheese, and sour cream. Next time I will skip the water.

When serving guests I'll make the time-honored rolls, but for a quick fix of Polish comfort food, this recipe works just fine!  I'll use a small head of cabbage without the core and ribs, and I'll squeeze a handfull of canned sauerkraut to add to the mix.  The substitution of a can of sauce for soup works for me, too, as does some parsley.  But other seasonings (oregano) gives it soo strong a flavor.  These aren't pseudo meatballs, thy're pseudo golabki!

Well, my husband and kids like this, by "mistake" ran out of tomato and used Campbells Tomato Bisque soup, and left out the sour cream. It was there FAVORITE. I have made it weekly since! I usually make the meat mix more tradition with egg, rice, but the Tomato "BISQUE" is my secret! Yay, I can prep this in less than 10 minutes, throw in the crock pot and go.

I love stuffed cabbage and was happy to find this recipe because my husband does not like it and therefore I do not make it often because of the hassle.  This is a perfect version of stuffed cabbage and will make it more often for myself now. I minced the onion in the food processor along with 2 cloves of garlic. I only used 1/2 head of large cabbage and did add 1/2 cup of rice (uncooked) along with 1 standard can of sauerkraut.  Did not use the sour cream.  I did this because these are the familiar flavors of my traditional stuffed cabbage and what I am familiar with. This is a wonderful alternative to rolling and taste no diffrent than the rolled version. Thanks!

Such memories this brought back.  I don't know if it was that memory or the taste that made me love this recipe.  I did the recipe as stated except I found that garlic salt was much better than salt.  I also put white rice in the bowl before the mixture for serving.  I think you could just add it to the pot..  cooked rice, that is..

This recipe tastes just like stuffed cabbage without all the work. I did make some changes. I added 1 cup of rice, 1-8oz.can of tomato sauce & 2 cloves of minced garlic. At the end of cooking time, I added 1/2 cup of milk instead of the sour cream. Delicious!!

I made this recipe and made a few additions.  I added uncooked rice.  I used ground pork and ground turkey instead of the beef. I did not add the sour cream but rather tomatoe juice and cooked it in my slow cooker for 6 hours.  It almost tasted like my moms.

I thought this was very easy and very tasty!  I added some worchestershire sauce, basil, seasoned salt and minced garlic for more flavor and served it over rice.  I threw everything together in my wok b/c this makes a LOT and u need a very big pot.  Great recipe!!  Will definitely make again!

Have made this a couple of times before.  Works just as well with ground turkey.  Need to add extra spices for more flavour, and cook it a little longer than the instructions say if you want tender cabbage.  It's also nice to mix some cooked rice right in to the dish before serving.

This meal was excellent! Using the recipe for 6 servings, I did change a few things, I used 15oz can of tomato sauce, a 15oz can of water, and a 8oz can of Pizza sauce. A teaspoon of Italian seasoning and 1 bay leaf. I added precooked brown rice the last 10 minutes. I skipped the sour cream.  My husband cleaned his plate and agreed that it was the greatest "comfort food" that we've had in a long time.  I made it in a electric skillet and it took about 45 minutes for the cabbage to cook. Five Stars!

Just made this for New Years lunch.  Great, easy recipe.  I substituted a can of tomato sauce for one of the cans of soup, added Italian seasoning, garlic salt and a pinch of oregano as it simmered, and then served it in a bowl over rice.  Yummy!

I love this recipe, its something I make at least once a month.  I use tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, and also add a large can of diced tomatoes.  I add plenty of basil, Italian seasoning, and garlic, and a little bit of dill and fennel too.  I also cook 1 cup of brown rice and add that to the mixture at the end.  Never tried adding the sour cream, it doesn't need it.  Adding rice makes it more like real cabbage rolls.

I did not add the sour cream, instead I put rice in to create more of a traditional 'cabbage roll' taste without the effort.  I also add diced tomatoes for more color.

This recipe sounded like a great way to simplify a family favorite.  We love cabbage rolls, but it takes a lot of work to make them.  When I make cabbage rolls I do not use sour cream or green pepper, so I'll leave them out.  However I always add bottled chile sauce (not salsa) to my cabbage roll "gravy."  I'd suggest starting with 1/2 of a 12oz bottle and adding more to taste.  I also add a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper.  These two additions should help to address some reviewers' comments that this recipe is good but too bland.  Thanks for the time-saving recipe!

I thought this was quite good.  I did not add the sour cream, just had that as a garnish.  I cooked some long grain white rice and added it to the pot.  Tastes like a cabbage roll without the hassle of making them.  This recipe makes a LOT.  If you are a family of two, you'll be eating it for days.  It is good though, so you might not mind!

This was a good and easy meal! We love cabbage rolls and this was just as good but without all the fuss. I didn't have the tomatoe soup, so I substituted with a couple of cans of tomatoe sauce and can of diced tomatoes....Since I didn't have the thickness from the tomatoe soup, I reduced the amount of water to 1/2 cup and used 1/4 cup chicken broth for flavor! Thanks for the recipe! We all enjoyed it very much!

My hubby loved this! I made a few changes to use what I had on hand.  I used a frozen 1-lb. roll of italian turkey saugage in place of hamburger and nappa caggage instead of green cabbage.  I added a pinch of dill and thyme.  Served it over rice - - delicious!  It's so quick and easy I'll definitely use cook it again.

this was pretty good and easy to make. not the most attractive looking dish but good for an inexpensive meal that will give lots of leftovers. much easier than making cabbage rolls and the flavour is definitely there. i also added garlic, substituted a can of tomatoes for a can of soup, a couple of slices of bacon, and some red pepper flakes and worchestershire sauce. i omitted the water as the juice from the canned tomatoes gave enough liquid. i would've given this 4 stars if i didn't have to add all the other ingredients.

I think this is a delicious recipe! My family loves it. I haven't tried adding additional seasonings, as some have suggested, and I still think it is very tasty and flavorful. I have forgotten to add the sour cream at times, and it is still wonderful.

I made this tonight using the 1/2 soup, 1/2 diced tomatoes. I added 1/4t dried basil, 1t sugar and some worchestershire sauce. I also added cooked rice to it at the end, as it was quite thin. It was still a bit bland, but I will make it again as it's hearty and healthy. We drizzled light sour cream on at the table and it seemed more like how we've been served this type of dish in restaurants.

I tried this recipe recently but added a few of my grandmother's ingredients. I added a cup of rice & 4 or more strips of bacon, chopped. Also added 1 14.5oz can of sauerkraut, drained. I layered some shredded cabbage, then the meat (cooked)& rice, etc. mixture. Topped with more cabbage and the can of tomato soup. Delish!! Just like Grandma used to make...in taste anyway.

This recipe was very quick & easy.My family loved it. I changed the recipe slightly using suggestions from other reviews.I only used 1 can of tomato soup,added 1 small can of tomato sauce (I found a sauce with basil,garlic & oregano included)& added rice to the pot. I will try to cut the recipe in half next time.

With a few changes, this was very good and will definitely become part of our recipe box.  Instead of two cans of tomatoe soup, we used one and then added a small can of tomatoe sauce.  Also added steak seasoning and lots of salt and pepper.

This was a lot easier to make then the real cabbage rolls. I didn't use the soup, instead I used tomato paste and 2 cups of water. I also used a cup of sour kraut. I kind of made it like lasagna. I put the cabbage on the bottom sour kraut on top of that then the meat mixture then the tomato paste on top of that and then put sliced kilbasa on top. I will make it again.

I have made a recipe like this for years and my Italian mother did before me, she learned it from dad's mom who was Polish..we always called it sloppy stuffed cabbage and added 1 cup of raw rice when cooking ground beef, onions and garlic..used the condensed tomato soup..it has been a family favorite for over 30 yrs.

I love stuffed cabbage but didnt make it often due to all the work involved. It is also part of my heritage.  This tastes just like my recipe and I make it much more now than I used to. Thanx so much.

Very very good and easy option to traditional cabbage rolls. HOWEVER, to really wow this up, add your fave steak seasoning spice to the beef, and add chopped bacon when beef is almost fully browned (you want the bacon cooked but not crispy). Follow all other directions fully, but add 2T lemon juice and 1T brown sugar. And lotsa pepper for some heat. YUMMY!!

Like others I seasoned to our taste. Also, to speed things up I nuked the cabbage for about 10 minutes before adding it to the pan.

I loved this.  There was a ton of leftovers and I had no problem eating this over several days.  I did substitute ground turkey for ground beef and tomato sauce for one of the cans of tomato soup as well as adding salt, black pepper, white pepper, onion powder, and sliced fresh garlic.

Thought it was a bit bland as written, so adjust to suit your tastes... overall good meal though.  I love cabbage rolls but hate the time it takes to prepare them.  Will make again and bump up the seasoning.

i tried this recipe earlier tonight and it came out AMAZING. i did add fresh garlic while browning the meat, only half an onion, as well as dried basil and thyme. i let it simmer for about 35min and it was perfect! i didn't use any sour cream, and served it up over white rice - although we both agreed that we like it better w/o the rice! This is one we'll be making again real soon, especially when winter rolls around!

My husband loves cabbage rolls, but once I served false cabbage rolls he said he likes this better. Whew!-a lot less work! I saute celery, garlic and green pepper with the onion and ground meat. I also sprinkle in some Tony's. I use 1 can of soup and 1 can of tomato sauce with 1/3 can water to rinse the sauce can plus the soup can of water. If I have a large head of cabbage, I only use half of it. This is so good and so easy! I sometimes add sliced zuchini, yellow squash, carrots and Italian seasonings. I do not add the sour cream.

Very easy recipe. Had something similar at a company potluck a few weeks ago and went looking for a recipe. I did add green peppers and a few spices I had dried in my cabinet. I think it will make even better left over tomorrow Night. This hit the spot in my tummy and gets a 4 from me.

This really didn't sound that good to me but boy was I wrong.  You can do so many variations with this too.  It kind of reminded me of a stuffed pepper.  I think adding some green pepper would be good with this.  My husband had 3 helpings.  What does that say?

I made a recipe of regular cabbage rolls, but ran out of usable leaves...so I made this with the left over unleafable cabbage and leftover filling.  My husband loved this.

I would make this dish next time a day ahead. The first day I didn't like it at all but the next day reheated it tasted much better. I had to add a ton of salt to the dish it was just too sweet for my taste. Being from Germany I am used to it tasting kind of sweet-sour. I also try to add vinegar to unsweet it. I would add wine sauerkraut instead of raw cabbage next time.

Excellent recipe.  We like spicy, so I added some Texas Pete to the recipe also substituted ground venison for the ground burger.  It was very easy & had exceptional flavor.  It was a whole lot easier than cabbage rolls & just as yummy.  Definately a 5-star recipe!!  Thanks so much!!

This is my son't favorite meal.  I have been making it for a couple of years.  I usually make it exactly how it is written, except that I double it.  Last winter I made it for my husband to take on a "guy's weekend" and everyone thinks he is married to the best cook!!

Instead of serving it over rice, I cooked the Minute Rice in with it, before adding the sour cream.  I just added a little more water.

I am looking for recipes that will help me get rid of the food in my fridge since I will be moving in 2 weeks. I came across this and since it looked promising and not too difficult, I made it tonight. 
I really enjoyed it except that it was a little bland, but still pretty good! I used to cloves garlic, less oil, and a 32 oz. bottle of tomato soup I had, I used half a can of tomato paste to thicken and some basil, oregano, spike seasoning, some worchestershire sauce, I added the water with some beef boullion, and a little brown sugar. I think i will stick with less soup and add diced tomatoes next time, but overall it was nice and thick and has a really good flavor, but I tend to like dishes with more flavor.

This was a little bland when I tasted it during cooking.  After I added an extra can of water, a small can of tomato sauce, 2 Tbsps. of lemon juice & about a Tbsp. of Splenda, it was more interesting.  The consistency was more like a cabbage soup, which I liked.  I added a little sour cream to a small plate of the dish as a taste test & I liked it better without the sour cream.  Different strokes for different folks.

DELICIOUS and so very EASY, EASY!  I gave it a 4-star rating due to the appearance; other than that, it really should be given a 5-star rating because of tasted great and it was extremely easy to prepare.
My son said that it may not look fantastic but sure did taste wonderful.  He ate more than one helping!  THAT is saying a LOT!  :-)

I was looking for a recipe similar to my mom's cabbage rolls but without all of the work. This is a very good recipe. Instead of the tomato soup, I used tomato sauce (3 cans) and a can of tomato paste. I added 4 cloves of garlic, parsley,red pepper flakes, and a bit of Italian seasoning to give the sauce some pep. A good way to reduce the fat is to halve the meat and substitute brown rice instead. I will be making this again!

This tasted great until I added the sour cream. Next time I'll leave that out. Had to add a few spices and I added one beef boulion cube. Son wouldn't eat it.......husband liked it ok, not great.

This is a GREAT substitute for cabbage rolls!  I added three cloves of garlic, chopped.  Also, the recipe is unclear about the amount of water.  I added two soup cans, and had to thicken with cornstarch.  Yummy!

Quick and hearty.  Husband enjoyed it more the second day and I enjoyed it for lunch for three days later.  I added a can of stewed tomatoes and it did make it bland  out a bit.  Next time I will not use the tomatoes and maybe add course black pepper to the mixture.

The basic recipe is a pretty good starting point.  I have always had rice as a component of stuffed cabbage rolls, so I substituted one can of tomato rice soup to add some. I used one bay leaf, two allspice berries, and some Italian seasoning.  The end result was really good and preparation was much simpler and quicker than doing traditional stuffed cabbage rolls.

This is delicious! Traded one can tomato soup with 1 can Rotel.  Also 1/2 lb. ground meat and 1/2 lb. Jimmy Dean hot sausage.  Served over white rice.  Will make it again for sure!

Autumn is here and this is a very satisfying chilly weather meal.  It has the flavors of stuffed cabbage although it does lack the texture.   I have substituted crushed tomatoes for the soup and omit salt (no need to add water). I have also used all or some ground pork. A pinch of allspice enhances both the aroma and flavor as does the addition of a bay leaf.  I have  also put everything  into a slow cooker with excellent results.  The next time I do that I will update with the time and heat setting.

I added some cooked rice about 8 min before I took it off the stove for a more traditional cabbage roll dish. I also used a gluten free organic prepared tomato soup and omitted the water. Tasted great and my hubby loved it.

While cooking onions I added mushrooms.  Next time I would add paprika while meat is cooking, add more mushrooms, and a large can of stewed tomatoes.  It is an excellent base recipe that leaves a lot of room for the creative cook to make variations quite easily.  I would definitely make it again, but definitely needs more spice added.

Not bad. Needed a lot of flavor doctoring with herbs and s&p. Was a little soupy until a threw in 1/2 box of orzo pasta. Then it was a good confort bowl but this is not something I would serve to guests.

This was very good.  I did add more water then added brown rice to the pot as I wanted this to be a one-pot meal.  I added another half hour of cooking time for the rice to cook fully then took the lid off to evaporate some of the extra water.  I would definitely make this again.

I used one can of tomato soup and one quart of home-canned tomatoes (rather than the second can of soup).  In place of the water, I used a small can of beef broth.  While simmering the beef, I added the onion, celery, green pepper and garlic.  YUM.  I simmered it longer than called for.  EXCELLENT

Made the recipe as stated.  A little bland, but I couldn't exactly decide what would have made it better.  My husband ended up putting a little hot sauce on it.  Overall, everyone liked it and because it's so much easier than traditional cabbage rolls, I'll definitely make it again while adding a few twists.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great basic recipe.  I am a big fan of bold flavors, so I agree with some other posts that this is a little bland as is.  However, the recipe is a great foundation and lends itself well to a bit of creativity with herbs and spices that suite your interest.  I have spiced it up with Italian, Mexican and Greek spices and all worked well.

just okay...I like recipes with lots of spices and flavor, so it was kind of bland for me.  everyone is different though.

This is good but I have one that likes the meat and doesn't like the cabbage. To keep her happy I make little meatballs and cook them in the oven Then go from there

My family makes cabbage rolls about once a year because it's so time consuming. I tried this recipe and thought it was a great substitute for regular cabbage rolls. It was very easy to make and really good. The only thing I changed was that I didn't use tomato soup, I substituted tomato sauce instead.

This was an easy and hearty recipe.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and lots of garlic.  I substitued pearl barley for half the rice.  I sliced half the cabbage finely and sliced the other half more coarsly in my food processor.  The larger slices had a nice crunch and sweetness to them.  I used only one can of tomato soup and added one can of muir glen roasted diced tomatos.  I froze half the recipe in smaller containers for later.  Sour cream was not necessary.

This was pretty good! My hubby, who's not a big cabbage fan, thought it was a keeper. I used one can of soup and one can of tomato sauce. Might try using the two cans of soup next time, could use a bit more spunk but would definitely make again. Served it over rice with a crusty loaf of bread,dipping the bread was half the fun! Thanks for sharing!

This was a surprise to me, it really did turn out good, did not use the sour cream but did add more spices. Will make this again, it's just so much faster than trying to get the cabbage apart so you can make rolls out of it. Thank you for the recipe

I tried this recipe tonight and my family enjoyed it. I did add minced garlic while browning the meat and about 1/2 tsp of dried basil. I think the recipe would have been a little boring without some extra seasoning. I only used half of a head of cabbage and that was quite sufficient. I also did not have sour cream on hand, but that didn't seem to take away from flavor. If anything, it was healthier. I served it with rice. My husband, who is a cabbage fan, loved this dinner and said I could make it again. All in all, a simple and quick dinner that my family enjoyed. Thanks Carolyn!

Everybody in my family loved this and I have a 5 year old picky eater! It was great!
Not a good leftover warm up though, we all found it tasted like chili after sitting in the fridge.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great. We ate the left overs the next day and it was even better. I think this would be great with or without the sour cream. Thank you!

I've tried this both with and without the tomato sauce, and it's better with.  Not as good as actual cabbage rolls, but good, and a time saver.

I did not have ground beef but used premade meat balls instead.  It was good, not quite like cabbage rolls but still a good dish. Very easy to make.

This was OK, kind of bland and a little on sweet side.  I added 3 cloves garlic, worcestershire sauce and tobasco and still not that great.  Don't think I'll be keeping this one, sorry.

It's simple and easy. I did not use the sour cream and it wasn't missed. Instead of undigestable black pepper, I used a smigion of cayenne' for a little "Heat".We served it over white rice. A huge frying pan to make it in is needed.  For a side dish I made Isblessed, " Green Beans for a special occasion", which is made with garlic and pine-nuts.  My family loved the entire dinner, it was healthy,filling,and very colorful.  Thank You for these wonderful recipes.

I quit making cabbage rolls because I thought they were too much work.  This recipe was excellent!  I did however omit the sour cream (not the way Grandma made them) and added a clove of crushed garic.

This recipe is a real keeper!!  Why would I spend time doing rolls, when this dish is every bit as good, thanks Carolyn T.  My biggest problem is deciding what to do with all the time I saved  making this dish.

This was delicious.  I love stuffed cabbage but it does take a long time to work.  This is great.
