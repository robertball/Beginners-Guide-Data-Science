This makes a perfect and easy lunch dish. I ended up adding a red onion for a little extra flavor/texture

10.19.16 ~ A good, simple salad that my DIL loved. With only four ingredients this salad comes together very quickly. I thought it needed a little chopped onion and some salt and pepper. After the first day, I did have to add a little more dressing as the pasta soaked it up. This is a nice dish for packed lunches. It quick to put together, has the protein from the tuna and cucumbers as your veggie.
