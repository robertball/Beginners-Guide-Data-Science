I left out the mushrooms and switched the cream of mushroom for cream of chicken, instead of veg broth I used chicken and added cream of corn. No peas, thyme, or celery powder and let me tell you..this recipe is a keeper! I made a batch of pillsbury rolls and poured the stew over each roll per person..such a great recipe!!!love love..will be adding this to my monthly menu.

Slow Cooker Ground Beef Stew Haiku: "Wow, this stew's ugly! Looks aside, it tasted great! Made happy tummies." Halved the recipe for 3, but 2 of us inhaled it. It looks, well, like dog food (probably due to cream of mushroom's unappealing hue), but still, this was a surprisingly awesome stew!

Had all ingredients and a lb. of ground beef thawed so decided to give it a whirl.  Didn't have tomato-vegetable juice or celery flakes. Subbed a can of diced tomatoes and cut up one stalk of fresh celery and didn't change anything else.  Might not win any awards in the "looks" department but I guarantee it will win hands down, the "quickie comfort" category.  It's delicious!

This is a 5 with these changes: 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup instead od cream of mushroom,  used chopped celery instead of celery flakes, 11.5 oz can V8, 1 can diced fire roasted tomatoes because that is what I had, extra garlic clove,  1 tube ea concentrated beef and vegetable broth  flavor enhancer plus 2 cups hot water.  I also used some chantrelle mushrooms;  I would never use canned mushrooms.  Yuck.   I did use sherry.    Did not use potatoes because I wanted to freeze leftovers.  I think because I used the Golden mushroom soup it did not come out looking like dog food.  I put the peas in about an hr before finished so they still looked bright green.  Cooked on high for 4 hrs.  Served with buttermilk biscuits and a slaw salad.  Yum.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous. I  followed it exactly, but used my electric pressure cooker instead of  a slow cooker.  Twelve minutes and we had a wonderful  meal.  Thank you so much Love2BakeGirl. Submit more like  this .  Simply delicious.

I thought this was fantastic; husband thought it was just OK.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of liquid ingredients for the broth, and the flavor and texture was perfect for me.

Loved it and I made it not so ugly...  I doubled the recipe and added a 1/2 tsp of paprika.  I added the diced onion, garlic and paprika to the meat and formed it in to a giant patty.  I cooked it 5 minutes on each side.  After cooking, I cut in to 1" squares.  It was not fully cooked but good enough to throw in the crock pot for eight hours.  I also added two bay leaves to the pot because I add bay leaves to everything.  Also, because I planned to freeze half of the recipe, I didn't add potatoes because their texture is ruined by freezing.  Instead, I cooked a single serving and poured the stew over the cooked potatoes.

Great recipe!   The flavour is amazing.  I added more liquid as well (including a splash or two of red wine), and used sweet potatoes.  Freezes well.

Great recipie.  Our local Aldi has great deals on somewhat larger portions, so I had to go overboard on this one.

They have 1 lb (16oz) bags of frozen corn and peas instead of 8 oz cans.

They have 1lb 10oz (26oz) cans of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the smaller cans.

They have 1 QT 14 FL (46 FL) instead of the smaller cans of tomato juice.

So I had to go big on this one.  It works out great.  I stay with the 1 lb ground beef.  I use 1 cup Chicken or Beef bullion for the hot water to melt the frozen items and allows stirring.

I have smaller sweet onions stead of larger White onions, so I use two.  I also don't like to fry them with the Beef and smell up the whole house, so I cut them into the Slow Cooker and it works great.

I have smaller potatoes so I use five or six.

Then I use random spices that I have lying around.  

A1 sauce out the fridge.  Basil.  White and Black pepper.  Maybe a little of five or six things I need to get rid of.

Made this three times already.  It's fantastic stuff.  I start it at 10pm and night, and 6am when I wake up it's ready to rock.  

I usually have a hot bowl of beef stew for breakfast just because it smells so fantastic.  I guess it's somewhat weird but what can you do.  You have to have some right out of the pot.

The rest goes into 16 oz freezer containers and usually makes 8 or 9 of those.  It's a ton of good food.

The volume of stock that goes into the pot it somewhat large.  It goes right up to the very edge of the lid.

I'm a terrible cook and this turned out amazing! I followed the recipe exactly as listed and was very pleased with the end result. My husband asked me to make it again in the near future. I think I'll add a cup or so of cooked chorizo next time just to change it up a bit. Thank you!

Made a few modifications to our taste - stew beef chunks instead of ground beef, no corn or peas, and Italian seasoning .  Delicious!  Used dry sherry too.

This is a keeper. I had no range so I did not brown meat with pnion. Other Substitutions-a can of rotels for tomato juice. Used 1/2 c of red wine, 1 can of diced potatoes and veg-all instead of fresh and frozen veggies. Did not add salt since using canned veggies. I Used Most of a box of vegetable stock

Ya, I made changes but it was an awesome recipe and it reminded me of my mom.   She made a dish that she called totties and mince.  This reminded me of her.  She was from Scotland and use to make this when I was a young man.  The recipe I had to change due to what I had in the kitchen but it turned out amazing in my eyes.  
I know people get upset about changing someones  recipe but there's a lot of people that dont like certain ingredients.  That's what is good about reading the reviews you understand what could be and issue with you, the cook, or ypur families tastes.  
All I can say is thank you for submitting the recipe.  I cooked it in the pressure cooker and threw in a package of frozen mixed vegetables I had as well as real celery, beef broth, canned tomatoes, no sherry, mushrooms and a little chili flake and it was awesome.
Thank you for submitting and I will make again.  My family ate all of it within 2 days and I 4x'd the recipe.  
Again Thanks to the original poster and to the reivewers ...

A definite winner...I used fresh veggies, cream of celery soup and canned corn. You cant go wrong..everyone loved it. I served it in bowls with cheddar or mozzarella on top, and rolls to mop up the yummy broth.

It was pretty good, but not as good as using stew meat. Ground meat just does not say beef stew to me.

This was really good with a couple of changes suggested by other reviewers.  I left out the peas since we don't care for them and I added extra broth and vegetable juice so it was more of a soup than a stew consistency.

I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have marjoram or mushrooms or celery lol I used Annie's organic tomato soup for the cocktail. Everybody here liked it. Classic and hearty..

15 minutes in a pressure cooker (high) was perfect. My son gobbled it up.

This was pretty good. I was looking for something different to make with the ground beef instead of my handful of usual go-to recipes. My husband even said he liked it better than regular stew with the traditional cubed beef stew meat. I'd make it again, thanks.

Did not have celery flakes so used cream of celery instead of mushroom soup.  Definitely add the sherry.  A whole can of corn is a lot for this recipe--next time will use half the amount of frozen corn.  Very good recipe--served with cornbread.

I enjoyed this recipe though I added extra juice as well as some water, texture is fantastic! For some reason my corn was ultra sweet so made mien taste more sweet rather then savory but still a winner.

This was delicious but I'm giving it a 4 because I wouldn't have had time when I was working (I stay home now)to gather all of the ingredients in the morning.
