Yummy! I doubled the sauce and used some merlot instead of cooking wine. Also added some garlic in with mushrooms. Pork was tender and tasty!!

My husband and I both enjoyed this. I added a bay leaf to the broth while it simmered- I think that added some depth to the flavour. Next time I will double the broth though, not nearly enough!

This was delicious!  I wanted gravy at the end so I doubled the liquid and added flour at the end to thicken it a little.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

This was excellent!  My whole family really enjoyed it.  I added flour like one of the other users suggested to thicken the sauce and have it over brown rice. I also doubled the amount of liquid ingredients and added more broth than wine.  Turned out great with no left-overs!

I actually DISLIKED this one.  Pork doesn't go well with red wine in my experience.  It's better with red meat.  I prefer white wines for pork.  This was a waste of mushrooms.  I was actually sad when I tasted the end result and I couldn't use my mushrooms in something that I liked.
I wouldn't repeat this again.  Save your ingredients, and your palate.

I thought it was delicious and contemplated eating a second chop, but I saved it. Yum! I got distracted and my sauce burned down to nothing so I had to remake it, but that was human error and I learned not to let the sauce cook for too long.

Very yummy, tastes like restaurant quality.  I added minced garlic to the mushrooms to give it a little kick.  I will also double the sauce next time as another poster suggested.  I served with Garlic Green Beans from this site and loaded mashed potatoes!!

I was visiting some friends with boyfriend and thought I'd try a new recipe and made this for them. It was a HUGE HIT among the three college guys I fed and we make a LOT now.  I made a few alterations though. I didn't use any mustard. I followed a previous userâ€™s suggestion on increasing the water ratio but added some beef broth too. And when ever I make gravy from a left over liquid sauce, instead of using flour or corn starch to thicken it, I keep a packet of brown gravy (but mushroom or really nay other kind will work) on hand and add about 1/2 to 1 packet to the liquid.

Very tasty!  Cooking wine has too much salt for my taste, so I used a good zinfandel instead; and because of the sugar in the wine, sauce needs to "boil" only about three to four minutes to thicken.  Will surely make it again, and add shallots to the sauce.

This was pretty good.. Like most others, I doubled the broth, added a little more wine, and garlic added to the taste.  I would make this again, simple to make, and tasty.

Great recipe!  I used a Cabernet, I like to cook with wines that I like to drink. I did double the sauce as another user suggested.   I also added minced garlic to the mushrooms as they were cooking.  I did add a bit of soysauce, black pepper, and extra mustard to the sauce.  I also thickened it, it was just very runny and not much to it.  
With the Cabernet and a touch of Soy Sauce it made it a really dark rich color. It tasted divine! =P  I think it is an extremely easy way to please a crowd. As most of you know a demi glaze can take a LONG time to prepare.  This is like an "instant" demi! So wonderful! You have to try it out!

These pork chops had a really good flavor. They were juicy and tender and the recipe was so simple. I will make this over again and again. I ended up using beef broth with onion in it and instead of using the cooking wine (I don't like them because they always taste too salty) I simply used a reisling. (It's what I had on hand.) The flavor was fantastic. Make sure to boil the liquid on high until it reduces down enough where it is a bit thicker and you won't need to add flour.

This was very good and easy.  The pork chops were very tender and moist. I'm cooking this again, tonight.

Delicious!  I sauteed the mushrooms in butter, salt and garlic.  It was fantastic.  Except I over cooked mine. ;(

I made with baby bellas and sauteed in smart balance.  I used a Pinot Noir for cooking along with beef broth.  It turned out well.  My boyfriend went back for seconds!  I will make again.  I think chicken or steak could also be used instead of pork.  I will make this again.

This turned out great! I used boneless sirloin pork chops because they were thicker and they were still really tender and tasted great. I was nervous about the mustard but I tried and it leaves a hint of flavor- I would definetly use it again. I added scallons and garlic the mushrooms though and it added more flavor. I also used some salt, pepper, and basil to add some seasoning. I made extra sauce as I went too using a past recommendation and I'm glad I did-- there definetly wouldn't of been enough sauce otherwise. I added a little flour too to thicken it up. Everyone loved this meal though, I'll definetly make it again!

I really liked this dish and pork chops are not my favorite. I do thicken the sauce and have even omitted the cooking wine and just used the broth and it is still very good.
