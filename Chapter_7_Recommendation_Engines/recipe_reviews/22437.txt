This one took me a lot of time to prepare. You might want to select which blue cheese you use, because I used a very strong one, which might have been why my husband couldn't handle the smell. But if you love cheese, this dish'll agree with you.

I made this recipe for a group of about 40.
Everyone loved it.  It was every bit as good as Linda said it would be.

The bleu cheese gives this a distinct flavor.  A hiot at the family party.

If you love cheese balls/logs, this is for you.It's very tasty! For a different way,I used swiss instead of cheddar, and I didn't use the bluecheese at all. Just follow the recipe, and add everything together, then roll it in the pecans and refrigerate for at least one hour.

Excellent!  My guests loved it.  I didn't use the blue cheese part, and rolled the ball in pecans.  It was simple and delicious.
