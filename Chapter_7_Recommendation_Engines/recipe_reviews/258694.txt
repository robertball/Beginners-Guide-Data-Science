7.1.17 I think this is one of those recipes that you can adapt the sweetness and spiciness to suit your personal taste.  I added more chocolate syrup and more hot sauce (I like that little zing that surprises you).  You can taste layers of flavor in this iced coffee, without one dominating.  And it just doesnâ€™t get much easier than this.  Very refreshing and nutritionally friendly, as well.  This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.

I used 1 drop of  Dave's Insanity Hot Sauce....and boy it was hot!
Tasty drink but I really don't consider it  a 'Mexican mocha coffee' drink. For an authentic Mexican mocha coffee you would use Mexican chocolate (such as Abuelita's)  which contains cinnamon.

I have to admit, I was a little afraid of this coffee drink. I couldn't imagine really liking hot sauce in my mocha, but I do! In fact, I added more than a "dash." I kept pouring until I could barely taste it and had a little zing on my tongue. Wow! What a way to start my day!

I like chocolate and chili so I thought I'd give this a try. tasty drink.  I added more chocolate and had a little whipped cream leftover so topped it with that. This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Pretty darn good. I didn't have chocolate syrup so I used cocoa powder and added some hot water. Hot sauce and coffee are a winning pair. Thank you for the recipe. This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

I added whip cream to this recipe just because it seemed right. It was easy, fun and had delicious results.

I REALLY enjoyed this drink. I was a little skeptical of the hot sauce, but ended up adding another dash after tasting it. So simple to make and it didn't cost me a fortune! Will definitely be enjoying this drink again in the near future.
