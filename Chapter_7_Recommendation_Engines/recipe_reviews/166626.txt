The last laugh is on me....I just fixed these on a whim because I had everything on hand and trying to use up part of a bag of frozen green beans.  Actually, I thought the recipe sounded rather "icky" but was I ever WRONG !  These are the BEST !!  Usually I go for lemony flavors on veggies, etc., but Airport Bob's Green Beans are OUT OF THIS WORLD ! I used peppered bacon. I've already shared the recipe with two other foodies.  SCRUMPTIOUS !

These were delicious!!  My whole family loved them.  I used fresh green beans and actually steamed them with a steamer pot instead of boiling in water and they turned out perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very similar to mine. But, I fry the bacon in a pan, until golden brown and crispy. I set the cooked bacon on the side and drain on a paper towel. I then brown the green beans in the bacon grease, adding garlic and season salt to taste, stirring occasionally until tender. Adding a few cloves of chopped fresh garlic and crushed bacon over top toward the last few minutes. Delicious.

I don't know how to cook and I'm working on window trim while my wife is out of town and I've picked these home grown green beans a day or two ago.  So, I thought I'd learn how to steam them and came across this recipe.    I find all the ingredients in her kitchen except only seem to have pre-cooked bacon and you know the paint can is open and I can't run to the store.  So I forge ahead.  The beans must have been past their prime, 'cause I had to steam them much much longer than you guys, giving me time to prime the woodwork even.    So, it all comes together and doesn't look nearly as green as the photograph, so I guess I oversteamed them.  But boy does it taste GOOD.  Can't imagine how good it would have been if a real cook had done it.  I might even save some for my wife.  I think I've found another hobby.

I cooked the sugar misture too long and it got hard as a rock.  I put it aside and when I reheated it, it melted nicely.  It got rave reviews at my house!  (I don't usually cook things too long!)

I used fresh green beans.  These were very tasty but I just couldn't get beyond the fact that I was eating all that butter and sugar.  But everyone gobbled them up - kinda like eating candied veggies.

Sometimes these really simple recipes do not deliver, but this one does.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this dish was.  We included it in our Thanksgiving menu as we needed a vegetable side dish, but we did not want to increase the cooking load too much.  This was really easy to prepare, delicious, and my kids loved it too.  Tough to go wrong with butter, brown sugar and bacon!

if you like sweet flavor in your green beans, this is the perfect recipe!  the sauce was awesome.  i used fresh green beans steamed for about 10-15 minutes, instead of frozen.  only change i made.  boyfriend didn't care for the sweet flavor, but i thought it was awesome!

Not what I call an ideal side dish of green beans.  Has a totally different taste than I'm use to.  In my opinion, sweet and green beans don't mix very well.

This was a hit on Thanksgiving. The only thing I have to change is the directions for the bacon. Everyone wished the bacon was crispy but the directions said not to cook til crispy. I thought it would crisp up in the butter/sugar mixture but it didn't. So next time, I'll top the beans with crispy bacon before serving. I also didn't use thick cut bacon but I will next time. I think it would be better with thicker bacon.

Liked the contrast of the somewhat salty bacon and the brown sugar.  I used steamed fresh green beans and this was a hit.  Nice to contrast something a little sweet with the rest of the meal.  Thanks!

These were awsome!! I just microwaved my beans and cooked up the sauce on the stove then poured it over (mixed it in). Make sure to drain the bacon and the grease out of the pan before adding the butter and sugar but a perfect change from regular green beans.

Really tasty side dish. I used fresh green beans, stir-fried them so they're still crispy, then added the bacon-brown sugar mix. Adding some black pepper and chilli oil made it even better.

This side dish is beyond words!  I made this dish for dinner last night and both hubby and I devoured it.  I did not make any changes to it - it is just a simple recipe full of flavor.  Will definitely be making this again.  Can't wait to share with family and friends....

The best! I usually skip the bacon and it is still so good.  A major hit when I bring for holidays even the little kids gobble them up forgetting that it's green. I always use fresh green beans but that is preference.

These beans were delicious for something totally different than we normally eat, even my kids loved them.  I used turkey bacon b/c I had that on hand.  Will definitely make again.

These are really good. They are a little bit sweet for me, but the bacon offsets the sweetness. I also added a lot of black pepper, per usual. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Made this for Christmas dinner. I doubled the green beans to 2-lbs. The other ingredients go plenty far to season even more green beans I think.  So delicious. Yum. Everyone like them.

These were so easy to fix and took things I always have around. I didn't care for the sweet from the sugar and I cut it in half as it was. My husband didn't say anything about it. I used french cut green beans. Thanks Tracy, I enjoyed trying Airport Bob's green beans.

I had fresh green beans so I nuked them till crunchy.  To much butter, made the brown sugar soupy.  Everyone loved it but felt the glaze should have been thicker.  Good nonetheless!

Oh my gosh, I LOVED this recipe!  I'm a sucker for sweet things and the brown sugar was just what I needed for fresh green beans!  I was so surprised at how good they turned out.  I cooked them for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  This is definately a recipe I will print out and use over and over.  Thanks!

My normally picky vegetable eaters loved this recipe.  In fact, 2 hours after dinner was over they wanted more. I always substitute turkey bacon for regular bacon, and next time I may cut the butter and sugar a hair, but it was great as written!

This recipe is ok.  My kids did not like the "sweet" factor (I know odd, huh?)  I probably won't make again. I thought it was fine but my fam didn't care for it.

This is great!  I was a little hesitant as I couldn't imagine bacon, brown sugar, and butter together.  But, it is wonderful.  Tried it last night and is definitely a keeper.  I will use this dish for company for something that will suprise them.  Thx Airport Bob.

The technique of cooking the bacon with brown sugar and butter is unhealthy, I'm sure, but it tastes crazy good! I'm going to keep this in  my arsenal to put salad. That's really the star of this dish.

I have picked so many beans from the garden I had to find a new way to fix them. This recipe did not sound good at all, but I needed something different. They were great. My husband loved them. I steamed fresh beans instead of using frozen. Very good.

These are very good, a nice change of pace from regular green beans.  They aren't good as leftovers (there's a lot of grease) but if you eat them right after you cook them they are great.

To me the brown sugar ended up tasting really strange with the bacon flavor. Probably won't make again. I kind of liked the bacon and green beans together without the brown sugar, though.

Was ok...I think the next time I make it I'll substitute it with olive oil...I didn't add the sugar to the recipe as the group I was making them for don't really fancy sweet veggies.  We used fresh green beans instead of frozen or canned which made it nice.

these were really good.  we had them with thanksgiving dinner this year.  i wish i had read some of the reviews before making them because i think that adding minced garlic would have made them even better.  i will also use less butter next time.

This recipe was okay. I personally think it was too sweet, and next time I'll add some fresh minced garlic when I add the sugar and butter.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner this year and they turned out great! I used Cut Italian Green Beans but left the rest the same. The kids didn't even complain about eating vegetables!

Although these tasted good (I did add minced garlic), they were WAY too greasy for my taste and were not good left over.  If I make them again, I'll use turkey bacon and MINIMAL butter.  I guess that's what I get for following the recipe :)

The green beans were crisp.  The sweetness from the brown sugar and saltiness from the bacon is perfection for this side dish.  excellent for the holidays

These were superb! I was looking for something to make with frozen green beans because I don't care for them plain. My whole family loved these. I used turkey bacon and 1/2 Smart Balance 1/2 butter blend. Can't wait to try these using fresh green beans next summer.

I just made a triple batch of these for Easter dinner and everybody really liked them.  I used fresh gr.beans that were bagged/ready to go and didn't really measure out the butter & brown sugar, but I don't think that matters much.  
I will be making them again and directing others to this recipe.  Thank you!!

I used fresh beans as well as others did.  The sauce and bacon were quite good, but overall there was a greasiness to the dish.  I think to solve this problem I would possibly cook the bacan using less butter and sugar but getting the taste into the bacon.  Then just add the bacon to the green beans stir and salt.

Quick and easy, I do appreciate the fewer ingredients for those days the kitchen is on limited supply.  I added some creole seasoning for more flavor.  I actually thought about stocking up on green beans so I can make this more often.  The sugar/butter to green ratio was perfect but next time I might cut some butter and sugar because of my diet...

Amazing recipe! Only thing I did a little different was I pit the string beans back on the stove once it was mixed with the Bacon/brown sugar mixture to let it reduce and thicken a little.   Very Happy I tried this.

I fixed this for Thanksgiving and it's definitely a keeper.  I used slightly more bacon because I hadn't measured the beans, and fresh beans instead of frozen.

I fixed this recipe with turkey bacon the first go around and the second time with regular bacon. My husband could not tell the difference. 
This is a refreshing twist on green beans. Just a lovely dish!

I finally made this dish and I'm so glad I did. I steamed frozen beans in the microwave. I spooned the sauce into the beans until I had the flavor I wanted. I tossed the extra sauce. My beans were not greasy bc I wiped the pan after I drained the bacon grease.

Everything is better with bacon, right?  The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly and it was just too much butter.  Because of the bacon flavor it is not necessary to add 1/4 c of butter.  I know only use about 1 or 2 tbsp butter or just enough to melt the brown sugar. I tend to use less sugar too, but not less bacon!! =)

Very simple and super tasty recipe!  I normally just salt and pepper my green beans but wanted something a bit more exciting.  My son and hubby both really enjoyed it so much, my son said he normally doesn't like green beans but with this recipe he actually wanted seconds!

This is great.  Some times I also sauté  some fresh mushrooms and some chopped onions in the bacon grease  and then Drain  it all and then  mix  the bacon, onions and mushrooms with the beans and butter and brown sugar mixture.   If I am taking it to a party I put it in the crockpot.

Never been a big fan of frozen green beans but figured I'd gave this a shot.  They turned out ok, might try this again but with canned green beans instead.

I've made things several times and it comes out very tasty.  However the last 2 times I've accidentally caramelized the sugar!  I'm thinking I should let the frying pan cool down more before adding the butter and sugar....still yummy  ??even with the mistake.

This is an awesome recipe ~ but warning...Don't overcook the butter/brown sugar mixture b/c it will thicken to a consistency which is not usable. I had to throw out my first batch b/c this mixture had hardened. I'm so glad that I retried it though b/c it came out perfect & so tasty.  I cut the recipe in half due to the amount of people I was serving & per other reviews, I steamed my green beans (which came out perfect) & added garlic and red pepper flakes. This will be the only way I serve green beans in the future ~ So Yummy!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and while sugar is not typical for green beans, I thought the combination of brown sugar and bacon sounded interesting so I gave it a try.   Simple, delicious, and delightful.

These were amazing.  I cut the brown sugar back to about an 1/8th of a cup, used fresh green beans and steamed them.   There was the touch of sweetness with the crispy bacon.  The entire dish was gone by the end of the meal.  No leftovers for lunch!

At last year's Southern Thanksgiving, this got high reviews so I'm making them again this year. Southerners like things sweet and these were great. The bacon provides the saltiness.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  Just make sure you don't cook the brown sugar and butter too long and use low heat, otherwise it turns hard like toffee.

I liked the sweet buttery taste, especially during the winter months.  I added half a sweet onion, diced, and 1/2 t of dried sage, which I thought gave a bit of savory to complement the sweet.  Many compliments from our church group (humbly speaking).

Made 6x this recipe for the fire department meal and it was gone.  We steamed the green beans then added in the prepped brown sugar/butter/bacon mix and all into a Nesco to keep warm.  Only change I made was using real bacon crumbles vs the thick cut bacon.  Every one loved it, including some who said they don't usually eat vegetables.

Woohoo! This recipe is a keeper. I made it for Christmas dinner and it will stay on my Christmas recipe list plus be used through the year. The mix of the bacon and brown sugar was a terrific foil to the green beans. Airport Bob knows what he's doing.

I made this for Christmas dinner. I followed the instructions but add it about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to my sauce with the brown sugar. It gave it a nice sweet tangy taste.  So easy and quick. And delicious!

Really tasty!  My husband and my daughter both liked this.  I cooked my bacon until crispy, because that is my family's preference.  I also cooked my green beans longer than listed because we do not like them hard.

I made this recipe for the first time several years ago and have made it manyore times since. The only thing I ever alter is that I sometimes use fresh green beans rather than frozen. Easy to make, completely delicious, and often requested by my friends and family.

Like other reviewers suggested, I steamed the green beans instead of boiling them, and I sauteed some garlic. I also veganized this recipe by using butter from Earth Balance Soy Garden and Organic Matter Vegan Bacon. This "bacon" is made from coconut flakes and comes already crispy in the bag, so no cooking and no fat draining required.  I got the nice bacon flavor in addition to a hint of coconut, which was a great touch!

Made these twice. Both times had issues w the sugar mixture crystallizing.  But the beans went over well.  Second time pre cooked the bacon and set aside and then cooked beans and finished by meltng the butter and sugar adding back the bacon and mixing w the beans.   Recommend this approach but only cook the sugar long enough to melt it very easy.   Made 48 oz of fresh beans and not one bean left w 10 adults and. 5 little kids.

A simple, tasty green bean recipe.  I had fresh green beans from our garden in our freezer, so that is what I used.  The brown sugar added a nice sweetness to the beans.  Serve these beans with 'Artichoke Chicken' and 'Out of the Hat Rice' both AR recipes.

This was the first time that I have ever been able to get my children to eat all of the green beans on their plate. I got bacon slices straight from the butcher and then, as suggested from other reviewers, I used fresh green beans and steamed them in my steamer pot first. Everything else I kept the same. Yum!

Awesome!  Always get asked for this recipe.  Easy to make, all ingredients usually on hand.  Don't pass this one up.  It's better than burnt out green bean casserole for thanksgiving.

I used fresh green beans. Had a dinner party and made these for the first time. It was the first dish gone! Everyone loved them. We also had mashed potatoes and some of the guests were putting the green bean sauce on there tators. Will def. make again!

I was skeptical but desperate for a new way to prepare green beans. I didn't use all of the syrup but poured only enough for a light glaze and then added the bacon.  It was wonderful.  Even my husband liked it and he usually shuns anything with sugar.  This will be a go to.
