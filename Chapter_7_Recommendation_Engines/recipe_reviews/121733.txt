Easy to make & a light crispy coookie ( my favorite kind). I always try to make the recipe as written the first time before tweeking it to my tastes but I made these for the first time yesterday with a couple changes.  I didn't have any almond extract but had some Raspberry oil on hand and mixed a few drops in the pink layer. Wasn't sure how oil would work once baked as opposed to extract. The chocolate layer I only had Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet chocolate on hand so I used 1 1/2 - 2 oz of chocolate instead of the 1 oz. of unsweetened.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the out come.  Great recipe that you can work with to create may different variations. Will definately keep on my MUST MAKE Christmas cookie list.

Very easy to make and very yummy!  I only had red food coloring with  a pour-spout, and let me tell you, 1 tsp is not equal to 6 drops!  My 'pink' dough batch turned out red, but luckily lightened a little in the oven.  I'll be sure to make these again, possibly using a red, white and green (with mint flavor and green food coloring) next Christmas and blue food coloring for Fourth of July.  Overall-great recipe Jan!

I made this cookie for a cookie exchange at work and everyone loved it. I did alter the layers to make it more Christmas friendly.  Layer 1 I used peppermint instead of almond and used a little more red food coloring. Layer two I added a little more vanilla flavoring and left the color the same. Layer 3 I used green white chocolate (and added a little more green food coloring). I hope this is helpful to someone, because they were delicious!!!!

I thought these turned out pretty good. It seemed they were sliced kind of thin for my preference, so if I made them again I would slice them a tad thicker. They are also a softer cookie, which surprised me. I also am not a big fan of almond extract, but I wanted to follow the recipe exactly. And, I thought the extract was too strong. The chocolate and vanilla part without the extract though were good. I might try vanilla or a strawberry extract next time, for personal preference. Interesting cookie though, thank you.

Jan.  I had to alter the recipe a bit because I had no red food color.  I used the almonds and almond extract in the white layer, made the chocolate layer as written and got creative with the red layer by stirring in just a bit less than half a package of unsweetened Koolaid.  I just kept adding until the color was where I wanted it.  The result was even better than I hoped, a mild cherry flavor which works perfectly with the almond and chocolate.  Thanks Jan, this recipe is a keeper.

Been using a recipe like this for years. Mine used cocoa instead of melted chocolate. Nonetheless the rest of the recipe and directions are the same. Do not miss using the almond flavoring. It blends so well with the chocolate flavor. It's now an annual tradition to have the colorful treats available at Christmas time.

Pretty tasty! This is a great recipe and I'll make it again and play around with the flavors a bit more...like spumoni flavored or something. I had a lot of fun baking these!

Very good recipe.  I used my wire cheese slicer to cut thin cookies. They came out perfect.

I love these cookies mostly because they are light and crunchy! The unsweetened chocolate isnt my favorite though. Maybe next time I will try semisweet. That could bring this from a 4 star to a 5 for me!

These were great. I made them for a Christmas lunch for my daughter and they couldn't get enough of them. I used pecans instead of walnuts. The cookie was so colorful, light and crunchy. I'll definitely make it a must-bake cookie for Christmas.

These cookies taste very good! A few tips:
- Make sure you really push down and smooth the first layer of dough on the bottom of the pan to create even layers
- Don't try using foil to line the pan - it creates ridges
- Use a very sharp, thin smooth knife to cut the dough and maybe use a ruler to really understand how REALLY thin 1/8" cookies are, otherwise your baking time will vary.

These cookies were delicious and very easy to make.  Everyone raved over them over the holidays.  I'll definitely be making them again (despite cutting my finger and needing stitches during the slicing phase!).  Next time I might add banana extract to the white layer and strawberry to the red layer for a banana split cookie.
