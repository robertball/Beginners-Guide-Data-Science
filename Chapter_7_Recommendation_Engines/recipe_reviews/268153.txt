I used one and a half can of broth and it turned out nice. Not too soggy and not too dry.

10.30.18  Yes,  43-1/2 oz of broth is a lot.  It didn’t moisten the bread, the bread was swimming in liquid.  After 2 hours on low, it looked the same as when I put it in the pot.  I then set the cooker to medium, checked again at 1 more hour (now at 3), same thing.  I scooped out as much of the broth as I could, increased the temp to high, set for another 1-1/2 hours (now at a total of 4-1/2 hours cooking), I then used a slotted spoon and put the stuffing into a casserole dish, baked at 375ºF for 1 hr 15 mins trying to bake off the moisture, but still ended up with a dish of mushy stuffing.  The problem here is simple:  TOO MUCH BROTH!  All of the ingredients are complementary traditional stuffing ingredients, but they need the right measurements.  A lot of time went into preparation, not to mention the actual cost. This was a huge disappointment.
