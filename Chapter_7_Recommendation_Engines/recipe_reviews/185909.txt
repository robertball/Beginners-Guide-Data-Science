Ok, so I read the other reviews and can see where they might have not liked this dish, but this is an excellent dish to tweak and make amazing. For starters I cut back on some ingredients. I omitted the cayenne, cut the chunky peanut butter to 1 cup creamy, and cut the chili sauce to only 1 tablespoon. In place of the 2nd cup of peanut butter, I added 1/2 cup of peanuts (this will cut back on the peanut butter flavor and give it a little peanut crunch). I also changed the soy sauce to ¼ cup and added a lot of garlic and onion powder to the sauce. I then added 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. In lieu of the 3 ½ cups water, I added 2 cups of chicken broth. I do not like chow mien noodles, so I kept those out all together. With these changes you will have a creamy (not too thick) sauce with an amazing flavor. Add directly and simmer it with the cooked chicken for about 5 to 10 minutes before tossing with the noodles. Right at serving, I highly suggest chopping up clean fresh cilantro and green onions and topping each plate. The cilantro gives it that extra Thai flavor. With these changes I swear it was very similar to my favorite Pei Wei Thai chicken dish.

Great starting point, but needs some alterations - as it stands, it comes out WAY too peanut buttery and the sauce too thick.  I added some additional sriracha and soy sauce, then thinned the sauce with milk.  Additional moves to create a thinner sauce could be welcome.  If I made it again, would also look to add some onion (vidalia probably) for additional texture and flavor (sweetness).  Again, a very good starting point, but play around with it.

I'm sorry, I've been married 18 years and have never served a meal that was so bad no one could eat it! No one is a picky eater either, we all pretty much will eat anything and try anything, but this was just.....I don't know. Perhaps there are some out there that liked it!

I modified the recipe and used about half the amount of peanut butter to reduce the fat and it was absolutely scrumptious. Next time, I'll reduce the water used too, but it was still delicious! I'll definitely make this again!

So delicious! I decreased the amount of  spicy ingredients by about half, and its still packs a nice level of heat. Peanut butter makes it a really creamy curry which works great.

I made this without the chicken. I just wanted a sauce for angel hair. I left out the curry (personal taste). It was delicious! It had the peanutty flavor with a little bite from the cayenne pepper and sirachi sauce. I will definitely make it again and try it with the chicken.
