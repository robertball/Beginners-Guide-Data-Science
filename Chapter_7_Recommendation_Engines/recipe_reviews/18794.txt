This was really good. I almost goofed up and put more liquid in because of all the reviews that siad it was dry- almost, but I decided to make it just like the recipe said the first time. THANK GOODNESS, i did. IT was NOT dry. It was PERFECT, moist. I pre-cooked and drained my ground beef.  I used minute rice. I used the exact ingrdients in the recipe- it was moist AND tasty. I can not figure out how someone could have made this and thought it was dry and/or bland. It was popping with flavor. I think that the bowl you use is probably important. A 2 quart casserole dish is small, and that is what I used, a round, clear glass one. So that in the center of my casserole the mixture was about three inches high. That could be why mine was moist and delicious. If you use a bigger panm (ex.9 x 13) you would spread it out very thin and it would probably get dry...

I have a very similar recipe called Dirty Rice Casserole. It calls for the addition of 2 tsp. minced garlic and Tabasco sauce to taste. I don't brown the meat first, but do find that after about one hour in the oven it is necessary to stir the casserole to break up the ground meat and ensure even cooking. Bake for 1/2 hour more and you have a super-easy meal.

This recipe was pretty tasty.  I substituted 1 pkg. dry onion soup mix and 2 cups water for the can of french onion soup and omitted the celery (husband's request).  It was perfectly done in 1 hour.  I did brown the beef first and drain the fat.  I will make this one again.

This was GREAT!
I will admit we can't have any green pepper and we read the reviews and found that a lot of people were complaining that this came out dry.
We added 1/2 cup of minced carrot and minced red onion and a can of half and half.  We took the advice of one of the reviewers and broke up the ground beef in tiny little bits, in a huge mixing bowl.  Then we added salt and fresh ground pepper to taste and some dehydrated green onion, which has a sharper flavor than fresh.  Added the rice, and mixed it in well.  Then the vegetables.  Tasted it again.  In a separate bowl we mixed the soups and half and half. Tasted again and added some nutmeg and beef base. We poured the liquid mix into a glass casserole dish and then added the ground beef/rice mixture, covered it and popped it into the oven and checked it's progress at 1 hour and it was a bit soupy.  We left it in for an additional 15 minutes and it came out moist and flavorful.  We topped it with Kerrygold Dubliner cheese and ate it with Bread Machine Challah I.  The recipe can be found on this website.  Ultimate Ease, Ultimate Yum, Easy Clean-up.

When I made this I browned the beef on top of the stove first, but I still cooked it for the same amount of time. It was great and it was also VERY left-over friendly.

I made a few changes... used 1 cup instant rice & no onions.  I precooked the beef & topped with cheesy french fried onions.  Baked it for 30 minutes. Even my pickest child ate it!  This is a new favorite!! (served it with salad and bread).  THANKS!

My family has been making this for 50 years.  We never brown the meat first.  For the last 30 minutes I spread shredded cheese across the top and sometimes the crunchy French onions.  Leftovers are quite good.

I used minute rice, as suggested by another rater, and also sauted my veggies with the ground beef, then drained the grease.  I sprinkled a little cheese on top and baked for 30 minutes.  It was fast, easy and my family really liked it.

My wife and I really enjoyed this.  I added a bit of cheddar w/ 15 minutes to go, browned the beef with a clove of diced garlic and drained it ahead of time.  A bit of BBQ sauce on top was a great addition.  Definitely lots of sodium; not sure if there's any way around that though.  Great hearty family meal.

Super good and really easy! I browned the meat beforehand because the ground beef I had was not lean, and while I did that I simmered the vegetables and rice (I used brown) in the french onion soup with about 1/4 c of water added, probably about 10-15 mins. Then I baked it for about 25 minutes and it was perfect. This way it was slightly faster. My husband tried it first and when I asked how it was he said "it's terrible, don't eat any" as he stuffed his face :)

I prepared this exactly as the directions stated.  After 1 hour I took it our and uncovered it, and it was not even close to done.  It was still pretty pink on top, completely pink in the middle.  I took the advice from one of the other reviews, stirred it up and cooked it for 30 more minutes.  At this point it just looked like grey Play-Doh, same consistency, and the rice had turned to mush.  I couldn't cook it any longer because it was starting to burn to the bottom and sides of the casserole dish.  It was unedible.  Maybe next time I'll do like others say and brown the meat first, then combine the ingredients and cook for 30 minutes.

Enjoyed by all.  I would definitely use less mince, more onion,green pepper and celery.  I think that adding grated carrot would be a good idea. I used cream of chicken soup (as we don't like mushroom)This worked well.  I also sprinkled cheese over the casserole. (Half way through the cooking time) I will definitely make this casserole again.

This is a favorite at my house. The only changes is that I topped it with chedder cheese, and mixed in some shredded chedder into the mixture to add a little flavor along with some canned mushrooms. My husband loves it!

My husband and I thought this was a delicious and filling dish.  We cooked the ground beef before assembling the casserole and it turned out great.

I used precooked ground beef and brown rice...really good  also did it with minute rice and that only took a half hour to cook.  The brown rice was longer.  It is very tasty and easy.

Pretty good overall! I browned the ground beef 1st before following the remaining portions of the recipe as is. There was too much celery for my husband's taste and I will try it next time in a small dish instead of a 9 X 13 pan.

I first made this over a year ago, and it was good.  We enjoyed it.  I made it again last night as written (9-27-11) and I didnt have any problem with it getting done, or the rice getting done, or moistness.  What I did have a problem with, it hit me why I probably didnt have those problems.  Because of the grease from the hamburger.  I decided then that I shouldnt make this again, unless I cook the hamburger first maybe.  The soups, well you could use a low fat version and that would help with fat content.  It did still remind me of a stuffed pepper which I havent had in ages and the flavors were fine but you could also easily add whatever you wanted.  Maybe if I used turkey burger, I would feel much better about that I think.  I do appreciate your sharing.

The recipe was tasty...I thought the green onion and french onion soup was a little redundant, so I don't know that I would add the onion again.  I pre-cooked the rice and the ground beef and then just warmed the casserole in the oven to save time.  My 3 year old liked it, husband isn't the biggest fan of rice, but he ate it and said the flavor was good.

I couldn't believe that the husband and the boy didn't like this.  Me & the girl liked it a lot. A few changes:  We don't eat rice, so I used "No Yoke" noodles (cooked).  Used a package of Dry Onion soup with 2 cups water (instead of canned French Onion).  Browned the beef with the white onions (fresh out of green), peppers, celery.  Also, to the beef: garlic powder, a splash of light soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, plus a generous pour of A-1.  In a 9X13 pan, halfway through cooking, I topped with a 2 cup bag of Mozzarella cheese and Original French Fried Onions.  Everything else was the same... If it were up to me, this would be put into rotation.

This is one of those recipes where you can add/omit/change ingredients and it still comes out good!  I've made it according to the recipes but tonight I added mushrooms, ground sausage, and shredded cheese and it came out great!

I made this using 3/4 ground beef and 1/4 bulk Italian sausage.  Browned the meat along with chopped onions, chopped green onions, chopped celery, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  I didn't have French onion soup, so used 1 envelope Beefy onion soup mix with 1 1/2 soup cans of water.
Do not add any more salt if using soup mix!  Used instant rice and mixed all together.  At the last 10 min. of baking, I sprinkled a mixture of shredded Italian and motzarella cheeses on top, covered and finished baking.  Yum!

This recipe needs a little spice - too bland.  
It takes longer than an hour to cook the rice in the dish.
Won't make the recipe again.

This recipe was a complete disaster! The rice was completely raw and crunchy, it was inedible. I don't see how you could ever hope for the rice in this dish to cook without adding water to it.

Very good. I used minute rice and dry onion soup mix with two cans of water as that is what I had on hand. I sprinkled a little mozzarella on top but I think Swiss cheese would be amazing. My family has asked for it to be added to the rotation. This is a bonus because it is so simple, too!

I used brown rice and microwaved it in the French onion soup for 5 minutes. I also browned the beef then combined everything together. I was concerned the rice wouldnt cook through otherwise. Overall very tasty and will definitely be making it again.

This was great! My family loved it! I left out the veggies only because I didn't have any on hand. Cook this just as the recipe says and it will come out great. After I made this I realized that this is the same dish my mom has cooked for years. Only in my family we call this dish "dirty rice".

Super Quick and Super Easy.  This went over well, we had no leftovers.  In variation, we used our own ground deer meat mixed with ground beef.  It was a perfect new way to eat venison (deer meat).   We will make this again.  I thought about using wild rice next time or variate with cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked the meat first (I used 93% lean but I didn't want even a little fat) & because I was making this for lunch for the grands, I used egg noodles (I boiled them first until halfway done) instead of rice, to make it easier for my 10 mo. old grandson to eat. I added  3 cloves of minced garlic, a "glub" of sherry (wsa probably less than 1/4 cup), used red bell pepper instead of green & used Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup. Like SPEECHTEACHER, I did cook this in a deep 2 qt casserole dish & I had no problems w/ it being  too dry. My infant grandson liked it but the rest of them just ate it so they could have some pudding. ;o) Thanks for the recipe but I don't think I'll make this again.

This was a great casserole.  My husband really enjoyed it, he put ketchup on it and said it tasted like meatloaf.  I liked it with steak sauce.  My daughter said too much onion for her, but the 2nd time I made it, I used the french onion soup mix (and took out the onion) and two cups of water and kept the green onion and she ate and liked it a lot more.  We will make this again!!

I omitted the celery, onions and peppers due to husband's aversion to them.  I added 4 oz. sliced mushrooms and I sprinkled 8 oz. shredded mozzarella over top.  This was very simple and satisfying on a cold night.  We enjoyed it with a little steak sauce.

I added minced garlic and some pepper.  I used the amount of soup that the recipe required and all the other ingredients but I only had 2/3 of the rice on hand.  The casserole was very dry and still did not have that much flavor.  I think I would try it again but double the soup to give it more of a sauce.  Also, it said to cook for 1 hour, it took 1hr and 45 min to cook the rice through.  I would definitley use minute rice next time.  I also precooked the beef, I didn't want all that fat in the recipe.

Great dish! My family asks for this all the time. I do not cook the meat first but crumble into baking dish and pour the mixture over the top. In the last 5 minutes of baking I cover with shredded colby and monterey jack cheese. I also use instant rice and it comes out perfectly every time.

This casserole has potential to be really good, yet it's missing something.  I definitely recommend baking for an hour and a half otherwise the meat doesn't get completly done, and it's real mushy.  I don't plan to make it again.

If I make it again, I will address the problem of under cooked rice and veggies. I will precook brown rice, and saute veggies before combining the ingredients.

I made this as the recipe called for and it was pretty good!  Everyone enjoyed it and the one in the family that always puts ketchup on everything did NOT put ketchup on this!!

Next time I will probably add something to it but I’ve got to decide what.  I was thinking mushrooms and maybe a little garlic.

I used a dry onion soup packet and approximately 1 1/2 cups of water, since I didn't have the canned french onion, soup.  I also browned the meat, with chopped onion and sliced mushrooms in advance, since I didn't have the other vegetables on hand.  It turned out plenty moist and enjoyed by my family.  I agree with a previous post, to retain the moisture it's best to use a 2 qt round casserole with lid/foil cover (not a 13 x 9).  Relatively simple and quick - I won't hesitate to make it again.

This was just okay.  Lacked flavor but was still just okay.  Next time, I will add cheddar cheese or diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning.  Might add some seasoned bread crumbs to give it more body.  Or cook covered but uncover for the last twenty minutes and then add cheese.

I did not cover the dish when I put it into the oven.  This may have been why the rice was still very firm and the vegetables too crunchy.  It was an oversight.  The gray brown color of this dish was not appetizing.   I do not think I will make this again.  It I were to make it again I would saute the vegetables.  Or better yet, I would cook them in a bit of water; maybe 1/3 a .cup.  This extra fluid would help the rice cook  Covering this is important.

Browned beef before baking. Not sure if this is the reason, but rice was not fully cooked after the one hour of baking. Had to add half can of beef broth and baked an additional 30 minutes. Flavor was fantastic.

Super easy and super tasty!  I did brown the ground beef first.  I added fresh mushrooms (because I had some on hand) and I used onion soup mix and 2 cups of water as a substitute for the french onion canned soup.  A keeper for sure!

I thought this recipe was great!  I used minute rice and seasoned with salt and pepper. I liked how the vegetables were still a little crisp and not soggy. I added French onions on top, as one reader suggested, but won’t do that again...and I will be making it again!

This was delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe said  except I subbed cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup. Hubby does not like mushroom anything. I did brown the ground beef first and drained it. I used a round 2 qt casserole dish and it was ready in an hour. Hubby and I enjoyed this. Will be making this again.

This will be added to the family’s favorites.  Everyone loved it and it was so fast and easy to make.  I cooked the hamburger and rice before baking.  It turned out great!!!!

Added fresh sliced mushrooms. Needs a kick. BBQ sauce, A1 Hearty sauce and even Worstershire  sauce helps this dish.

Easy comfort food made with things you have in your pantry.  What's not to love?  Hubby woofed it down with the comment "You should put this on the rotation :-)"  Only change I made was to use an envelope of  dry onion soup and two cups of water in place of the canned onion soup.  Baked it in an 11 x 7 glass baking dish covered with aluminum foil.  This is a very forgiving and adaptive recipe.  Thanks for posting!
P.S.  Great leftovers too!

i thought it was very easy to make. The  name with french onion was a bit of a misnomer as I could not really taste the onion in it.  I used an orange pepper instead of a green pepper.  Though I did not include it in my making it, I thought some caramelized onions and a few dashes of hot sauce would enhance the flavor.

I would probably make my own low-sodium french onion and mushroom soup save a portion of each, then make it again.

No changes made to the recipe. The rice was not cooked after one hour of cooking. Had to cook 20 minutes more. The taste was fairly  good but the consistance of the mixture was not good. I will not fix it again.

I sure did enjoy this.  Made it as per the recipe except I didn't have green onions so I used about 1/3 C diced onion.  So simple to put together.  I was tempted to add the cheese but I thought I'd let it go this time.  I'm sure I'd like the cheese on top.  Other reviewers also mentioned the french fried onions  which I think I'd like also.  I noticed some reviewers said it was on the dry side.  Mine was nice and moist.  I'm wondering if they forgot to cover the dish while baking.  I almost made that mistake.  I put it in the oven and happened to look at the directions again when I noticed it was supposed to be covered.  I jumped up, pulled the dish out of the oven and covered it with Reynolds wrap.  Glad I corrected that error.  Will make this again fer sure.  Thanks for posting.

Followed the recipe to the letter, almost.  Living in the Southwest, I had to sub out the bell pepper for Hatch green chile.  I have to agree with others that the finished product is quite dry, almost resembling a version of dirty rice made for those who don't like chicken gizzards.  I really didn't see a resemblance to a casserole.  I found that the leftovers heated in some butter made a great hash of sorts to hold a poached egg.

After reading the comments, I altered the recipe somewhat.  I added 1/2 cup  celery, yellow onion, chopped carrots, mushrooms, and instant rice.  I mixed together 1/2 lb. of hamburger, and 1/2 lb. pork sausage which I pre-cooked.  I used dry onion soup with 2 cups of water.  I added 1 tsp. of Herbes de Provence, and fresh pepper. After an hour, I uncovered, and sprinkled cheddar on top. I  then cooked for 15 additional minutes.  It was very good, but next time I would precook the vegetables too, as I don't like them crunchy.  My son said it reminded him of Dr. Martin's Mix from the I Hate to Cook Book.

The only difference I made was to add shredded cheddar cheese and French fried onions the last 15 min

Excellent. I am not use to making a casserole with raw hamburger. I have only used raw hamburger when making a meatloaf. I have always browned the hamburger first for a casserole. I was somewhat hesitant but did follow the recipe. I also used minute rice. Absolutely wonderful meal. Hubby also enjoyed and this will definitely be made again

While this was quite good the recipe was lacking in information.  It does not say to add cooked or uncooked ground beef.  I cooked it.  My picture looks like it has cheese on it but there is none in the recipe
As I said it was quite good my family called it a keeper

Was great. We added cheese on top. And I was out of celery so put in some diced tomatoes for a different texture. Was yummy. Thinking of adding broccoli next time. Ooh - we also added cheese on top??

Made as written except omitted green onions.  The soup has enough onion flavor.  I used lean ground beef and did not brown it first.  was a little worried about that but it was fine. I like how that saved a step.  Just be sure to crumble raw meat into small pieces.  I give 4 stars not 5 because it was a bit bland to me.  I tasted it when it was done and it needed something.  I added black pepper and stirred then topped with shredded cheese and French fried jalepenos  and put back in oven another 15 mins.  I'm thinking this will be fantastic as leftovers!! Beware: this dish is very aromatic and your house/clothes WILL smell oniony for a while!  I was glad to try this.  Something different for a change.  looking forward to further tweaking.

I loved this.  It was very tasty.  However, I didn't like the idea of doing it in the oven with raw beef so, I cooked it on the stove top.  I had run out of regular long grain rice so, I used the jasmine rice I had on hand.  I added a cup of beef broth to ensure that the rice cooked and it turned out very well, in my opinion.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the original recipe as followed would never work. I made this last night, and it would have been perfect if I had cooked the rice before I baked it. I read some of the reviews before-hand, and I should have listened. I should have used minute rice instead of just plain rice; or cooked the rice first. The rice was not cooked after baking for an hour and a half. I also cooked the hamburger before baking, because putting raw hamburger meat in a casserole seemed like a really bad idea. Anyways, besides the rice being crunchy, my family liked it. The flavor was very good (I added 6 cloves of garlic and some season salt to the hamburger while cooking), so I am going to try it again; this time I will get it right!

I read all the reviews before I started. I made some minor changes. I omitted the green bell pepper because that is not a flavor I associate with French Onion soup...which this dish sounds like it's emulating. And I used sweet onion in place of the green onion. I also added a teaspoon of low sodium Better Than Bullion Beef Base.  And used the low sodium Cream of Mushroom condensed soup instead of regular. I used Minute Rice instead of regular. Everything else was what the recipe called for.  I didn't have a 2 quart casserole dish so I used an 8 x 12 glass Pyrex. I saw some reviewers who used 9 x 13 had a problem with dryness so when I put the cream of Mushroom soup in, I filled the can halfway with water and shook it to get all the soup stuck to the sides...so that was a little extra water just in case. I didn't precook anything.  I cooked it 30 min and then stirred it. Cooked it 20 more mins. Then for last 10 min I put 6oz of shredded Swiss cheese on it. Then topped it with French Fried onions. It's a good thing I put the Swiss cheese and fried onions on top because otherwise it was pretty bland. I probably wouldn't have eaten it without the cheese. And I should have grated the whole 8 oz of the Swiss cheese block. More cheese would have been better. The moisture and consistency was good. I wasn't crazy for the taste of rice in this dish...It takes away from the flavor of French Onion soup. Maybe some egg noodles partially cooked would have been a better flavor option.

Was looking for an easy recipe that I could make with what I had in my pantry. That said, I had to substitute the ground beef for chicken and used brown instead of white rice. Also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and 2 tsps each of minced garlic and hot sauce. After cooking for 45 minutes I topped the dish with sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese and put it back in for the remaining time. Very tasty.

It didn't look appetizing but it was pretty good. I recommend to cook long grain rice before adding. I did use a red pepper instead of green and dried onion soup mix. The soup mix called for 4 cups water but I would half that if your adding minute rice or cooked rice.

Super easy to make and feeds plenty of people. I feed this dish to people who hate onions and mushrooms and they never even realize they are eating it!

I'm eating it as I type. lol. I live the flavor. I used ground chuck in place of beef. (I think its less fat) that's what I had in fridge. anyways... I followed directions. My rice ended up being crunchy still somewhat so I added a cup of water and cooked it for 13 more min. That solved the issue with that ? maybe because of the chuck instead didn't have enough grease to cook rice. I don't know. but its yummy now. thanks!

I goofed and bought cream of celery instead of mushroom and only had yellow onion and none of the other veggies. I cooked the beef and veggies and since I was using regular rice not instant I used about a cup of water as well. Cooked it an hour and it was perfect. Hubby liked it, said it tasted kinda like a stew I thought it was good, my 10&6 year old ate it but didn't comment so they didn't really like it :) will make again, cheap and easy!! Thanks

I added cheese and am glad I did...it would have been way too bland without it. We didn't love it, but we ate it. I wouldn't make it again, though. Thanks anyway.

I used leftover brisket(roast beef would work) instead of hambuger. I also used brown rice instead of white. It was GREAT!! I also used the review that had used dry soup mix and add cheese on top.

Very simple and filling. I browned and seasoned the meat before assembling,added a can of mushrooms as had been suggested. I did add shredded Monterey Jack after 40 minutes of cooking. We liked it. Thanks!!!

Meh, we didn't think much of this. One hour in the oven was way too long - the veggies had cooked down to nothing. There was pretty much no flavor, certainly nothing at all like French Onion. Perhaps some dry French Onion soup mix might help? Anyway, I won't be making this again. Sorry.

I'm always looking for ways to use ground beef and this is great. I did precook the meat but only partially in the microwave for about 4 minutes, then broke it up and drained it. I used ideas from other reviewers and added mushrooms, used instant rice, minced garlic. I didn't have the onion soup so used the mix and 2 cups of water. At the table we thought it a wee bit bland, so added some lite soy sauce and it was really good. I added some to the leftovers too and they were just as good. Will make this a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy, inexpensive, and tastes great!  Followed the suggestion to use 1 pkg Lipton Onion Soup plus 2 c water since I didn't have French onion soup.  Browned meat first, covered baking dish, stirred after 30 minutes, after 20 more minutes it was done.  Melted cheddar on top.  Yummy!  Next time will add more bell pepper.

I tried this, with several of the modications recommended, and it still seemed to be lacking something. My 1 1/2 year old enjoyed it, but we struggled to eat the leftovers.

Used pre-cooked hamburger and doubled the veggies.  After a hour the dish came out dry tasting and not much flavor.  Easy to make but not that exciting.
