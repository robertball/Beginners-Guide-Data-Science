I too grew up in Newfoundland and these were a "must-have" during the Christmas season. My kids loved them, especially when they helped make them. Thanks for sharing !! :)

The cooked mixture was too soupy and would not roll into a ball to roll into the coconut.

Substitute the milk with a can of 370ml Carnation evaporated milk and then it's authentic newfie snowballs! Plus it taste so much better! This recipe is still pretty good :)

I usually make these with same ingredients but no cooking.  Just put all in a bowl and use your hands to mix good, then roll in coconut.  I tried the cooked one today.  The mixture is hard to make balls because it is too soft.  I was able to do it by running my hands under cold water before rolling each ball.  That helped .  They are good and a little healthy with all the oats I tell myself.

This recipe seemed quite easy so I don't know how I managed to screw this up! Made a double recipe for Christmas to give away. Used evap milk like one reviewer suggested. Waited 20-30 minutes for the chocolate/milk liquid to absorb into the oats & coconut mixture, and it was still too wet to roll into balls. I did have some leftover melted chocolate chips in a pan I added, but that should make it more stiff. I'll try to salvage it by adding more oats. Also, the photo looks more like they were rolled in powdered sugar, instead of coconut.

Found the mixture needed to cool longer than 5 minutes, cooled mine for 15 minutes. I also toasted the 1/2 cup coconut then rolled the cookies into that.  Mmm good !!  :)

Not sure what I did wrong but the mixture is too loose to make into balls.
