I didn't have enough cream cheese so I did 4oz cream cheese and 4oz sour cream. Didn't add psyllium husk. It was plenty thick. I don't like kale so none of that. I served over fettuccine Miracle noodles instead.

I only made enough for myself.  No noodles, used cauliflower  broccoli mixture.  Plus I added silverd almond and pumpkin seeds.  I think it was better than a restaurant.

waaaaaay too salty. It also was a VERY thick sauce. IF I were to make this again, I wouldn't add salt.
