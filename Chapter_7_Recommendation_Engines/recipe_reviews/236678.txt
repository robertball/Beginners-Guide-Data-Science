Delicious!   My family loves lamb and this recipe was a nice spin on the traditional shepards pie.  The list if ingredients calls for mushrooms but it wasn't included in the instructions.  I added them when I added the onions and carrots the the lamb.  I will make this again.

We raise lamb, so I'm always looking for yummy new ways to prepare it.  My family love it, and I can't wait to make it for others.  This will definitely become a family recipe.

Delicious. Didnâ€™t add the mushrooms as not a fan. Used mild cheddar and havarti. Husband loved it!

this is delish! the photo I addes doesn't look that visually appealing but it tasted amazing. the only soup I had was chicken and sweetcorn, I was a little nervous about using it as I knew the flavours might not blend well but it was lovely. I'm really pleased. I added rosemary to the mince when cooking them and also sprinkled some over at the layering stage alongside the salt and pepper. Thank you!

For some reason I was very skeptical of this recipe but decided to try it to use some lamb. It was delicious. Made it as directed except threw in a cup of peas, could not help myself I love peas. But great recipe and makes a ton.
