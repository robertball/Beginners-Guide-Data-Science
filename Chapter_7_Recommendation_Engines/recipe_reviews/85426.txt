Oh wow, will THIS ever be a repeat in my house! For extra flavor I used dried porcini mushrooms which I soaked in hot water for about 25 minutes. I then used the soaking liquid for the water called for.  What a boost of flavor! Pearl onions not a staple in my house, I simply substituted chopped, sweet onion, though shallots would me nice too, and added fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. My only criticism is that half the amount of butter called for would have been adequate, and I am a fan of butter! I served this with Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls, also from this site. Update to original 4/4/08 review: For those like my husband who (go figure!)dislike it, you might want to go a little easier on the Parmesan.

This is the third time I made this recipe. This time I changed it up a bit. I added grilled chicken, shrimp and extra mushrooms. I doubled the liquid ( chicken broth, water and wine). It was really good. We had it as a main dish. 

January 18, 2010-
Writing again just to say that I still use this recipe regularly. I even use it with a good short grain rice and it's delicious.

I loved this side dish.  I didn't have pearl onions so I used half a regular onion chopped up and I added minced garlic and extra mushrooms.  You can never have too many mushrooms.  The wine gave it such a great flavor.   Oh, and I used chicken broth instead of water.  This really was great.  I will definately be making it again and again!  Thanks  BABARCLAY.

I used chopped onion, and per the other reviews, substituted chicken broth for the water.  This is a flavorful side dish that's quick and easy!  Will add more mushrooms next time.

I previously rated this after making it once. Since then, I have made it more and played with the recipe just a tad, and now I LOVE it!!  Have made it several times and I crave it.  For the mushrooms, I just used button mushrooms, and 1/2C as the recipe called for turned out to be 3 mushrooms...not enough, at all.  I now make it with like 10 button mushrooms, I'd even add more.  I use chopped white or yellow onions instead of the pearl, and I use one minced garlic clove instead of garlic powder.  I also increased the wine to 2/3C, I really like that wine flavor.  So, with those changes I now love this recipe and plan to make it a lot!

I had to use 2X the amount of water listed and cooked it for about 3X as long as it recommended. Good side dish, easy to make. I also used most of a smaller yellow onion and a portabello cap instead of pearl onions white mushrooms.

This was an easy and quick side dish. I didn't have pearl onion, so I used a chopped medium onion instead. At the advice of another reviewer, I used chicken broth for more flavor (and left out the salt).

I didn't follow the directions very well, but we loved this idea. I sauteed the mushrooms and onion in 1 tbsp oil, added garlic and then deglazed with about 1/4 cup white wine. I used 14 oz chicken stock and 1 cup orzo, covered and simmered for 7 minutes and then added the parsley, cheese and a splash of fat free cream. This is my husbands new favorite side, big compliment coming from him. I've made this 3 times already. Thanks for the recipe!

So I overcooked the cod, undercooked the brussels sprouts, but this dish came out perfectly! I was so pleased with the results. Instead of the water and wine I used 1.5 cups of chicken broth. I was nervous when I dumped it in because it looked like a lot of liquid, but the orzo absorbed it all. I would double the mushrooms, though. Instead of the pearl onions I used a small sliced yellow onion. And about half the butter. I will be making this over and over again! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Seriously, I could have eaten this whole thing by myself!  I loved it!  First of all, if you are lucky enough to be able to afford pearl onions (!), you need to drop them in boiling water for a minute or so.  Then cut the top off and squeeze the inside out of the wrapping.  I sauteed them in two tablespoons of butter in a a 10" skillet until they were lightly browned.  I used crimini mushrooms--most of a little 8-oz container--and maybe three tablespoons of butter more (so not the whole 1/2 cup called for).  Instead of water, I used some broth I made from a home-baked chicken.  I used some chardonnay for the wine.  I did use the seasoning to taste as suggested.  This cooked down perfectly so that when I added shaved parmesan to the end product, it was just perfectly done.  So good!  I can't wait for the leftovers!

Everyone loved this!  I did use shallots because I don't care for pearl onions and added 2 gloves minced garlic.  I used half butter and half evoo and chicken stock instead of water.  This definitely has the "Wow" factor going on.  Will make again many times.

This is fantastic.  I used chicken broth and  about 3/4 cup of coarsely chopped onion. ( I didn't have pearl onions in the  house) I used Sauvignon Blanc wine. I served it with Chicken Asparagus Roll Ups from this site.  Just a little  mixed greens with strawberries and sugared pecans, and Hazelnut raspberry dressing on the plate also..   It looked beautiful and  tasted  great.  You can  make the roll ups ahead of time.  A  wonderful company  dinner. I think this was my  DH favorite dinner ever.

great side dish!!!  I added more pearl onions cause I love onions.  I took the advice of the "most helpful" review and soaked the mushrooms in hot water.  I thought that would overcook the shrooms but surprisingly it didn't.  Man, this tasted excellent!!!  I ate this with Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill Sauce on this site.  Off da chain combination!!!  STRAIGHT UP!!!

I loved this recipe!!  I sauteed a little bit of garlic (about 1 clove) in the beginning rather than using garlic powder later in the recipe.  You don't need to use as much butter as is called for.  You can substitute EVOO for a portion of the butter.  Fresh parsley is nice to have, but dried worked great too! This is great even if you don't use a ton of parm!...    would definitely make this again!  One criticism, you should COVER YOUR SKILLET at the end while simmering in order to keep the moisture from escaping so the orzo doesnt become dry.

I liked this recipe a lot.  Added some prawns for additional protein, broccoli for color and nutrients, garlic...just because. I hadn't used pearl onions before...but cooking them for 3 minutes and squeezing the pulp out of them worked well, and kinda fun.  I didn't use as much butter as listed to cut down on fat. 5/21/2018 used a suggestion from the reviews and added some rehydrated Porcini's to the cremini's...using the mushroom water and broth/wine to cook the Orzo. Zehr Gut.

This is so easy and very tasty. I used a regular onion instead of the pearl onions and chicken stock. Next time I make it I will use different varieties of mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe!

I checked my box of orzo for the ratio of liquid and increased the amount to a total of 2 1/3 c. I also used some granulated chicken bouillon. This was a delicious recipe! My family loved it.

I prepared this recipe for the first time tonight and it was delicious.  It had such a wonderful, rich, tasty flavor.  I modified the recipe and added more more mushrooms, canola oil and margarine instead of butter.  I also replaced the garlic powder with fresh garlic and the pearl onions with yellow onions.  The next time I prepare this recipe, I plan to either eliminate the orzo and incorporate it into a veggie or all mushroom lasagne and/or prepare it as a pasta sauce.

EXCELLENT. Wow. If you prefer a carmelized onion flavor, over traditional onion flavor, try this: Add a small vidalia onion and 2 gloves of garlic into your food processor. (Omit the garlic powder called for. Add the entire stick of butter in the beginning and get the onions slightly tender. Add the orzo and one-half of the wine. Use a sweeter wine, like a Riesling, to give some good sugar quality. I used Piesporter White Wine but any sweet grape variety would do. Stay on top of it during this stage of cooking as the carmelization will start to happen and could burn quickly.  Lastly, use fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms, and omit the parsley. 

The outcome had a savory blend with just a hint of natural sweetness that was delicious. If you like the taste of carmelized onion, savory with just a hint of sweet, this modification is for you.

I've made this twice and it is very good!  First time I made it as presented, and it was a little too buttery and Parmesan-overpowering for us.  I cut the butter by almost half, and only put in a sprinkle of Parmesan the second time, but put grated Parm on the table for guests to add as desired.  Some added none, others a ton, so it seems that's one way to allow people to adapt to their own tastes with this dish.  I would readily make again!

I wasn't expecting much, but I thought this was pretty good. I was looking for a recipe to use up some pearl onions. Like many folks, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 6 T. of butter, instead of 8--just put all the butter in the pan, melted it and added frozen pearl onions (about 1 1/2 c.) and 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms. I let them cook for a pretty long time--I find that mushrooms taste better the longer you cook them. I then added some fresh garlic and the orzo and about 5 minutes after that, added 1 T. vinegar and 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth, since I wasn't using wine. (The vinegar was a little strong, would cut back next time.) I had to cook the orzo longer and added more water. In addition to salt and pepper, I seasoned with some Worcestershire sauce. Threw in some fresh thyme with the parsley, just 'cause I had it on hand. 

After using up this bag of frozen pearl onions, I decided I'm not a fan of pearl onions, except for creamed pearl onions at Thanksgiving. So if I made this again, I would probably use regular onions.

Really good and really easy to make.  I like this recipe because you can alter it to your taste.  I made it as is and everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I may try it next time with spinach.

I wish that I could give this recipe more stars! I didn't have any pearl onions so I chopped up a Spanish onion. I replaced the water with a can of chicken broth. This recipe is a delicious and easy side dish.

This was a very good recipe.  I used diced onions in place of the pearl onions and beef broth for the wine and water.  Will make again.

Very quick and easy. I used 1.5 cups of chicken broth instead of water and wine. I also used about 1/4 onion, chopped instead of the pearl onions. I used baby bellas and less butter than called for (2TBS for onions, then added 4 more, 2 at a time while I sauteed the mushrooms and orzo). Everyone ate it (i'm lucky, my kids love mushrooms). I served it as a main dish with french green beans on the side.

Everyone in my entire family, including my picky nephews, loved this.  I followed the suggestions and substituted chicken broth for most of the water, although I did need more liquid in total, like others said.  Great side dish.

We loved it. I made it twice this week since it only uses a half box orzo and I had left over mushrooms. Next time I will probably just double the recipe. I followed the suggestion of using chicken broth. The second time I didn't have onions so I used a green bell pepper.  It was delicious both ways.

FABULOUS! Tasted almost like risotto to me... but so much easier to make. Used vidallia onion instead of pearl, and used the chicken stock instead of the water. I think I could go with a lot less butter next time though to make it not so fattening... since my husband and I ate the whole 6 servings easily by ourselves in one sitting with grilled pork chop.

This is really, really good. I had to add more liquid to the skillet, but I think it may have been because I used a very large skillet and it cooked down too fast. I wish I had made more - my 2 guys knocked out 6 servings in one shot. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!! Wow..wow! I was so surprised and proud of myself! This mushroom orzo is definitely a 5 stars +++...so delicious and pleasantly satisfying. I used crimini and button mushrooms, chopped up along with chicken stock for the water called for in this recipe to give it more flavor. I also used 1 garlic clove, chopped up with the fresh shallots I used in place of pearl onions. I used the butter amount called for in this recipe however I think next time I will cut it back some. The wine, mushrooms, stock all enhanced this pasta wonderfully! Even my honey was complimenting over how wonderful and tasty this was. A keeper in my recipe box to be used time and again! Served with, "Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls,"also from this website.

I made this tonight, and my husband and I loved it.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because as written, there is a definite wine taste which my kids weren't crazy about.  But we loved it!  Other than subsituting chopped onions for pearl (I was out) and fresh garlic for powder (personal preference), I followed it exactly.  Next time to make it more kid friendly, I might substitute broth for the wine--but then again the adults were happy with the wine taste!  Will definitely make again.

This was absolutely delicious! The wine really adds great flavor. I made it once following the recipe exactly. The second time I realized I ran out of mushrooms so I made it with a bit of cream of mushroom soup and I also cut the butter to 1/4 cup and it was still fantastic.

Served this for dinner for 8 guests and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Because I doubled the number of servings I cut back by 1/4 on the butter, doubled the amount of onions and mushrooms and used chicken broth instead of water.  I'll definitely make this often.

I love this recipe. It is versatile and easy to prepare.  I used red wine instead of white wine and I added mixed vegetables to the dish: it was delicious. Please note that extra liquid should be added to cook the Orzo.

Definitely one of the best side dishes I have ever made. I made it for my in-laws on Christmas and everyone was VERY impressed.  I did need quite a bit more liquid than the recipe called for, but it turned out great. Thanks!

This is the best pasta dish I've ever made!  It was quick, easy and wonderfully flavorful.  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I reduced the butter to 2 T.  I used reconstituted dried shiitake mushrooms, and used their broth for all of the liquid.  I probably used about 2 c. liquid total.  This was great with grilled chicken.

Um....could we say super yum!    I used chicken stock in lieu of water....dried parsley instead of fresh (didn't have any)...and 1/2 chopped onion replaced pearl onions (again, didn't have any)...Very pleasantly pleased....Wish there was a way to cut down on the butter...Any recommendations welcome...

This orzo was pretty good... By no means great. I enjoyed it but it was just a little boring for me. I did try to use it as a main course, though, for a smaller/lighter meal. I think it would work well as a side to a meat entree.

great dish when using other's suggestions!  I used 1 1/4 cup chicken stock and a little less than 1/2 cup white wine.  I also cut down on the butter by about a tablespoon.  then I added some chicken to make it a main dish. Even my 3 year old asked for seconds!

This is one of my favourite orzo recipes. I didn't have pearl onions, so substituted diced sweet white onions. Also, I used freshly grated parm. This recipe is easy, simple, and quick.  If I didn't have the wine on hand, I would probably use vegetable broth in place of the water and wine.   Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was sooooo good.  I didn't have any pearl onions so I used a regular one.  I followed the recipe exactly as written but next time I think I will substitute chicken broth for the water. I used fresh mushrooms and I added just a tiny bit more than it called for because I had them and I didn't want to waste them. I might try this with canned mushrooms next time and see if it tastes just as good.  I always have canned mushrooms on hand and this is a fast and delicious side dish. My kids thought it was risotto ~ even after I told them it was pasta they kept calling it mushroom rice.  :)    Even my 12 year old who hates mushrooms loved this !

This was good, at lot easier to make than risotto with a similar taste.  I used portabella mushrooms as they tend to have more flavor.  I also used fresh garlic and shallots in place of the pearl onions.  Will make again.

This was really tasty! But I felt it had way too much butter in it. I  even used a tiny bit less than 1/2 cup and it was really greasy.  But I will definately make this again but try it with 1/4 cup of butter instead.  I also added 1/2 tsp chicken granulated bouillon.

Wow was this fabulous!!!  I used chopped sweet onion instead of the pearl onions.  Definitely something I will make on a rare occassion to spoil our dinner guests.  Great creamy consistency.  Thanks for sharing.

I used 1/4 cup of butter total, 1/4 of a medium onion (diced), 1 cup of orzo, about 1½ cups of fresh sliced mushrooms, 2 cups of chicken broth, no water, no wine, a few shakes of garlic powder, a few shakes each of pepper and salt, and 1/4 cup parmesan. It took a very long time to cook, more like 25 minutes. I also ended up having to add another 1/3 cup of water as it was getting dry. It WAS really tasty, though, and I will make it again... Hopefully I'll remember that it needs to cook longer! Thanks for sharing, BabarClay!

Really good, except it needed WAY more liquid than called for.  It could be because I used whole wheat orzo...which has a really nice bite.  I would do this again...but watch the salt content.  When using beef broth, it can get a little salty!

This is a very tasty recipe! A little on the greasy side, though. I substituted half the butter with olive oil. The next time I make this, I will start out with half as much of each and add more as needed. I also used chicken broth instead of water like some other folks.

Great recipe.  I didn't have the pearl onions, so I chopped an onion.  I also didn't have the white wine, so I used just a touch of extra broth.  Delicious!

Went back for thirds!

Wow. Made this just like the recipe except used a whole small container of baby Bella's. Even though I undercooked the orzo, my boyfriend went back for thirds.  Amazingly tasty  for such few ingredients. Next time will try chk broth instead of water, but it was delicious with water and plain ol' white cooking wine. I think the mushrooms add the flavor.

A new staple int the recipe reptoire.

This recipe saved my day! I've never cooked orzo before and I decided to find a quick recipe. This is the first one I saw and I thought it sounded simple and quick, so I gave it a try. Very tasty! Orzo by itself is bland, so I was surprised to make such a delicious side dish out of it. Thank  you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious.  I halved the butter, tripled the mushrooms, added broccoli, skipped the parsley, and used yellow onion.  I used extra water but don't think it was necessary.  I think I would try broth next time.

My family and I loved this dish! I added 1/2 a chicken bouillon cube, doubled the amount of mushrooms, sauteed sliced onions instead of the pearl and added chopped red pepper to saute. I sprinkled a couple tbsp (instead of 1/2C)of parmesan cheese in before serving .
Amazing!!!!! Comfort food at it's finest!

Wonderful side dish! It is equally as good if you don't have white wine on hand. I have made it both ways, and both are delicious!

I had a mushroom orzo from our local italian restaurant that I have been craving, and this was nearly identical...and delicious!  Next time I would add more mushrooms (perhaps shitake) and finish with some truffle oil.  I doubled the sauce and added shrimp in the last 5 minutes of cooking and allowed it to rest for a few minutes after.  Absolutely awesome!

Absolutely amazing!  I doubled the orzo and the liquid.  Next time I will double the mushrooms.  I used regular onions as I never have pearl onions.  I only used 2 T butter to begin with and 1 T when I added the orzo.  This was delicious!

So I thought this was a great way to start out! I too used Chicken broth instead of water but added 1/2 c due to other reviews. 2nd try I will omit the extra liquid and see how it cooks up. (resembled sloppy risotto) but my 4 stars is due to the strong wine taste. Nxt time I will halve the wine. (I onlycook with good quality wine I would drink!) Topped w fine parm chz and green onions only cause i did not have parsley.

I think this is the lazy man's risotto. I have made this with venison and also with duck and compliments their gaminess well. The second time I did cut down on the Parmesan cheese, as we thought it was overpowering the other flavors the first time.
Thank you!

This was great! I made it TWO nights in a row, my hubby and I loved it SOO much! I served it with teriyaki chicken and we thought they paired together well. I used half the butter, a few more pearl onions, and the first night I used 1/4 c white wine and 1/4 c chicken broth. The second night I used all chicken broth because I didn't have any wine to spare :)! Both turned out great! I also used dried parsley, which tasted fine to me.

Fantastic - Thanks Babaerclay.  I am always asked to bring this to dinner, pot luck. Even my husband who is a potatoes guy asks for this!  The changes I have made is to add a can of mushroom soup for a creamier version.  Fresh garlic and chicken broth as others have suggested as well.  Love it , love it!

I made this last night and it was good.  My only complaint was it was a little oily from all the butter.  I think next time I would maybe cut the second divided part of the butter in half.  I would also up the last part to 10 minutes instead of 7.  My orzo was a little crunchy, but that was my fault for not testing not the recipes.

This recipe was recommended by a friend (thanks Susan!) and I have made it twice in the last two weeks.  My husband and I both love it!!  I took the advice of others and altered it slightly.  I used diced onion (1 c.) instead of the pearl onions and substituted 3 cloves of minced garlic (cooked with the onions) for the garlic powder.  I increased the amount of sliced mushrooms to 1/2 cup and also used beef broth instead of the water (or other's recommendation of chicken broth) and I think the beef broth adds an 'earthiness' and goes well with the mushrooms.  Also I didn't have an open bottle of white wine available so I used 1/4 c. dry vermouth and 1/4 cup water and I cut back on the butter slightly.  It IS very similar to risotto but a lot less trouble.  It has become one of our favorite pasta dishes.

Everyone including my 18 month old loved it!  I did use a bit less butter, boiled the orzo beforehand and skipped the water stage.  Used about a tablespoon of dried parsley, omitted the wine, added some broccoli florets since my kids need the extra veggies.

This is a great recipe for orzo. I used half the butter and that was plenty

A very similar recipe is on the back of a box of "Roundys" orzo.  I tried it and I agree, it was restaurant quality.  The only difference was to use broth instead of wine.  I think I will try wine next time.

This is the first time I've rated a recipe.  It is SO delicious I just had to share my opinion.  It "melts in your mouth", probably because of all the butter. ;)  I doubled the recipe and it required a lot of butter.  The only thing I would change is not adding so much butter (for a healthier version) and maybe adding a bit more wine or water as a substitution liquid.  But OH...SO...YUMMY. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe!  This has become one of my go-to sides for dinner.  I used chicken broth instead of water as recommended by another reviewer.  I've also added spinach to this recipe to add more veggies and give it some color.  Yum!

Excellent recipe- I've never really known what to do with orzo.  Even my daughter who normally won't eat mushrooms or onions thought this was great.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time, second time I used chicken broth for the water for a little extra flavor. Quick and easy and a definite keeper.

This is amazing!!  Subbed in vidalia onion for the pearls, chicken broth for the water, and added some chicken to make it more of a complete meal than a side dish.  Was so good!  It's very rich so if I made it again as a meal instead of a side I would probably try to reduce the butter and lighten the sauce up.  Super easy to make, had most of the ingredients on hand, and it was very much appreciated by the recipients.

I had to use twice the amount of water and cook it for a few minutes longer than listed, but it came out very tasty. Will be having this one again.

Lots of flavor.  A whole stick of butter in this recipe seems like way too much, so I only used 4 T, but next time I'll try 3 T.  I used homemade chicken broth in place of the 1 c. of water, and I needed additional water to get the orzo fully cooked even with keeping the pan covered the entire time the orzo was simmering.  I used about 5/8 c. of additional liquid.  If you cut back on the butter, double the sliced mushrooms, and add extra chicken broth/water, this becomes a 5 star recipe and would also be a great way to flavor rice.

My grocery store doesn't carry pearl onions so I substituted Cipolline onions and they were great.  Also, I followed other reviewers' advice and cut way back on the butter.  I only used 2 T.  I substituted chicken broth for the water and found that I had to add more during the cooking process because it got too thick and the orzo wasn't cooked yet.  I think I ended up doubling the liquid.  I also skipped the parsley as I just didn't have any.  This was very good.

I just made this last night, and it was a hit.  I used green onions instead of pearl (didn't have pearl), and and about 1/4 cup of butter.  I followed other reviewers advice and used chicken broth instead of water. I actually substituted the wine with chicken broth as well because I didn't have any white wine at the time. I look forward to trying the recipe with wine and pearl onions, but this first pass was great

This was really good. I didn't have pearl onions, so I used a medium onion, roughly chopped.  I also didn't have any wine, I replaced the wine and the water with chicken stock.  I used 2 portobella mushrooms,roughly chopped (it was way over a 1/2 cup, but they cook down a lot). This is a very rich recipe, so I would suggest cutting the butter to about half.  If it is still too rich, I would suggest cutting the cheese at the end to about a 1/4 cup.

I would have given this 5 stars, except that I altered it.  I cut the butter out, used olive oil instead, used real garlic, and tripled the mushrooms.  Loved the texture of this, it reminded me of a risotto, but with a lot less work.

I think this was good. The butter was overwhelming so next time I think I will reduce it. I added minimal salt/pepper and I will increase it to 1/2 tsp or a pinch more. Otherwise, a nice side dish.

Great recipe! I loved the earthy, rich flavor. And it was a one dish recipe! I halved the butter. It stuck a tiny little bit at the end, but the flavor and texture was there. Also, I didn't have pearl onions, so I thinly sliced a white onion and it was fine.

Pretty tasty beginning for pasta. I used chopped Vidalia onion and sauteed with the mushrooms. I cut back the oil by about 1/3 and it still was good. Only addition was fresh basil at the very end. Delicious!

Super easy recipe that will keep me from buying any of those box or envelope rice or pasta mixes at the store. And this one will be so much better for my family. I used 3/4 c chicken stock in place of water (would have used in place of entire cup but it was all I had). I also did not have a full cup of orzo (short about 1/8 cup) and that seemed to be just the right amount. I used double the amount of mushrooms and it wasn't too much. Next time I make I will double the recipe using 1 3/4 cup orzo to 2 cup broth and 1 cup white wine. I will also saute the mushrooms with the onions. Overall excellent and a keeper for me!

Sooo Good! I love orzo and I love the combo of mushrooms with finely chopped fresh rosemary (3/4 tsp) and I love the combo of rosemary with cream so I finished it with 1/3 cup of whipping cream as well as the parmesan. I subbed Vegetable Broth and 1/2 cup of chopped white onions and closer to 1 cup of chopped mushrooms. Served Hubby and I as a side dish with grilled herb chicken with barely no leftovers.

I made this to be a stuffing for bell peppers.    Like other reviewers, I cut the butter down (to 2 Tbsp), added a teaspoon of evoo and a splash of fresh lemon juice.   When it was ready, I stuffed four huge peppers and crocked them on low for 6 hours.   Delicious!

Easy recipe to follow. Taste great. Few things to mention regarding this recipe and my next attempt: 1) No need to use so much better, about half of the amount will do. 2) I will use water, (add) chicken broth, and (use less) white wine. The white wine taste was too strong IMHO. 3) I think added a few different mushroom varieties will really kick this up a notch.   Great recipe!!!!! Too easy!!!

This was my first time cooking orzo and I enjoyed it BUT I think that there was waaaay too much butter for my liking. It made it very slimy. I could have easily halved the amount of butter. I doubled the mushrooms as well and used diced onion b/c I didn't have pearl onions on hand. It was a pretty standard recipe hence the "3 stars" but my BF seemed to enjoy it.

Incredible recipe! Although I did change quite a bit. I used 1 Tbl of olive oil to saute 1 diced red bell pepper, then add about 10-12 sliced baby bella mushrooms and saute until tender. Add 3 Tbl of butter and about 2/3 of a 16oz package of orzo pasta and saute for about 5 mins. Add 2 cups of water bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste, stirring frequently and adding more water along the way if necessary until pasta is tender. Finish by stirring in some fresh shredded parmesan. Soo good, I would make this every night if my boyfriend would let me!

I only rated it 4 starts because I made so many changes. It is a very good dish!! I increased the liquid 1/2 cup. I used chicken broth instead of water and salt. I too increased mushrooms to about one cup and sauteed the onions, mushrooms and fresh garlic in about 1/4 cup olive oil instead of butter. Thanks for the recipe!

I bulked this up with other vegetables - one zucchini, two carrots, and 10oz white mushrooms plus one portabello.  Also used vegetable broth instead of water. My husband and I are trying to eat more veggies and less carbs - I stuck with the amount of orzo called for, but probably ended up using 4x the veggies chopped in my food processor.  We both loved it.  Definately do this again.

My hubby LOVED this. I liked it too. But found it very rich. I think next time I will use less butter and cheese. It had very strong flavors. I think you could add cooked shrimp or chicken and had a complete meal.

I thought this recipe was awesome. I followed some reviewers suggestions and substituted beef broth for the water, which added alot of flavor. I also reduced the butter, per some reviewers suggestions (I used approximately 3/4 of what the recipe called for). I also used a few cloves of diced up fresh garlic instead of powder. What I added to the recipe was a can of diced tomatoes. This turned out to be DELICIOUS! I suggest anyone who likes tomatoes, try this. I added them towards the end, when the orzo had absorbed most of the broth. It added color and alot of flavor. I made the recipe without tomatoes at a later time, and didn't think it was nearly as good (still good, though ;). Overall, I love this recipe, and pretty much everyone who's tried it loves it as well!

This was fantastic!!  I cut the butter in half, used a regular onion and chicken broth and it was great!  I'll definitely use this recipe often.

I used frozen mushrooms, frozen pearl onions, and added some extra frozen chopped spinach. It was delicious despite all of the frozen ingredients. I also used whole wheat orzo. Even my husband liked it and said he would eat it again.

Loved it!  One thing I would change....use half the butter and use olive oil in place of the other half of butter.  It was just too much butter.  I also used one small regular yellow onion instead of the pearl onions (didn't have any).  I also threw in a big handful of fresh spinach to the onion/mushroom/orzo saute before adding the liquid.  Absolutely outstanding.

This was good. Like others I subbed chicken broth for the water. It dried out pretty fast so I ended up having to add a bit more right before serving.

My Husband loves this dish and so do I. I think the 1/2 a onion is just fine. The only thing i would change is the fact that the mushrooms and the onions should both be pre cooked, till onions are clear and the mushrooms are almost cooked that way the rest of the cooking can be done when the orzo is in the wine and broth. On top of that i would also do as the other cook says and melt the cheese after romoveing from heat to mix in. This makes the hole thing creamy and yummy.

This was so delicious!  I followed other suggestions and used stock instead of water, real garlic and regular onions.  It was so creamy and comforting!  The cremini mushrooms add a yummy meaty quality to the dish.  Will definitely be making this often.

This recipe was amazing. I used less than half the butter called for and it was still very creamy. I also quadrupled the mushrooms and parsley, and I used fresh garlic.

This was pretty good.  I used a whole 8 oz. package of mushrooms, as I agree with most other reviewers that it needs more!
The parsley adds a really nice fresh flavor so try not to leave it out.  It is ridiculously easy to grow, so if you don't have some, plant it now!!  To answer another reviewer's question, no, you do not need all the butter...I used half as much as it called for and it turned out nicely.

Excellent recipe! I modified it to our preferences; used chicken stock instead of wine/water, added more mushrooms and used diced onions instead of pearl, fresh garlic, and left out the parsley. It was rich, creamy, and perfect with our ham dinner!

I made this last might for dinner with chicken - it was fantastic.  I used sliced baby portobello caps, diced yellow onion, and a can of low sodium chicken broth instead of water and white wine.  I also just sprinked the top with fresh parmesean - it turned out perfect.  I plan to make this a lot!

This is great!! I only used half of the butter called for and it was just fine.
I also used 1.5 cups of chicken broth and the 1/2 cup of wine and it was just enough liquid.If you like this one be sure to also try the "Orzo with parmesan and basil" from this sight. It too is wonderful!!

My first time to try orzo and I had no idea it would be so hard to find it in a grocery store.  I went to 4 stores before I found it.  The dish was good, but I don't know that it was worthy of me running all over town in search of orzo.  I probably will make it again though now that I know where to find it, but I will either cut the wine by half or use a VERY mild white.  Also, I don't like pearl onions and all I had on hand were shallots, so I diced one and used it instead and I too used chicken broth in place of the water.

The white wine flavor was a little heavy for my family. I thought more of it would cook off, but the mushrooms and parmesan were delicious.

This is just a delicious recipe!! I also did use chicken broth and added extra mushrooms, we love mushrooms and I doubled the recipe, it is delicious reheated (I never get any though, everyone beats me to it!). We had it along with the grilled salmon 1 (another one of our favorite recipes! Which I bake instead of grill!), and spinach with lemon. Probably in my top 5 all time favorite dinners!!!!

I will be making this a regular side dish. Very simple and versatile. I used chopped yellow onion because that's what I had. Next time I want to use stock instead of water, but even with water it has plenty of flavor.

This was SO easy, and love the one pan dish. I had to use some alternations just because of what I had available in my kitchen already. I will make it to the recipe to the letter after I get to grocery store.

We have made this several times. Absolutely delicious! I typically follow the recipe as written but do occasionally add fresh garlic with the onions while they are sauteing and don't add the garlic powder. I have also dumped leftovers into chicken broth with some shredded chicken for an easy chicken and rice soup.

I used regular white onions. Was going to use Shallots instead of pearl, but they were soft. I used half the butter and topped up with olive oil. Used Marsala wine and mushroom/chicken broth. And the most important thing, I took two chicken breasts, cut them into cubes, fried them in butter, olive oil and garlic separately in a frying pan,  then added them to the dish about 5 mins before serving. Caesar salad to complement.. BOOM>> . HUGE HIT ! And the plus is its an easy recipe.

This orzo recipe is delicious. This is the second time I made it. I chopped up a sweet Vidalia onion in place of the pearl onions and I used chicken broth in place of the water. There was not one grain of orzo left in the bowl when we were finished with our shrimp scampi and orzo dinner.  I also used a can of sliced mushrooms, drained. They work great in this recipe too.  This will be in my permanent recipe file..yummy

Love this recipe!  Works great for a weeknight dinner, or a fancier meal with guests. The first few times I used a large skillet, and found that I always had to add more liquid for the orzo to cook completely. Started using a stock pot instead and it cooks much more efficiently

Made this as a side dish with seafood. Very good, seasonings could be changed up to whatever type of meal you’re eating. Protein could be added for making a 1 skillet meal.

Family and guests adored this dish. The mushrooms I increased to two pints. I used chicken broth instead of water and chopped onion and one shallot for pearls. Next time I’ll cut back on the butter. As is, it kept warm on the stove well past allotted time which helped me time getting the meal on the table all together. Definite keeper.

Delicious. I used 2 cups cremini mushrooms, only 1 tbsp butter, added chicken stock at the end to allow time for orzo to finish cooking (orzo took approx 15 to cook), used about 3/4 cup Chardonnay, and it was awesome!

It's so good. I cut back on the back butter and would probably cut but more next time I make it -- may not even add much more butter at all the second time.

This turned out amazingly! It's said to be a side dish, but I made it my meal with more mushrooms and piece of cheesy bread. I also used chicken broth, as another reviewer suggested, to add even more flavor. Next time, I may reduce the butter, but it's just so decadent the way it is. I didn't have pearl onions, so I used half a sweet onion. Will use more onion next time too.

I made this and went down very well. I added porcini mushrooms and the water used to rehydrate them in order to add a little depth of flavour.

I've been wanting to make this and happened to have fresh parsley! Gave 4 star because too much butter! 1/2 as much worked. I'm glad I tasted while cooking. Did not have white wine so subbed chicken broth (ls) for water and wine. Prefer fresh mushrooms but only had canned, they worked in a pinch. Used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder because garlic powder leaves a terrible aftertaste in my mouth, no matter how small the amount. This was delicious with the changes I had to make, and will definitely make this with correct ingredients when have them. I know the flavor will be deeper with wine and fresher with fresh mushrooms. Still less butter, though!

This was really yummy. I did use chicken broth instead of water and wine and sweet onion instead of pearl as this was what I had on hand. Extra crimini mushrooms added to the great flavor. Everyone liked it, even picky dh. Will be a repeat for sure.

This was so delicious that my husband and I ate the entire thing and he suggested that next time I double the recipe.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I used 8 oz of mushrooms and chicken broth instead of water.  Also, I lightly  sautéed the mushrooms in the butter before adding the onions.

This came out really good. I followed some of the tips from other reviewers and used chopped onion instead of the pearl onions, and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth as opposed to the water and wine. Also, I used a little over a cup of mushrooms, and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  My family loved the dish. However, it doesn't make a whole lot. Based on how much your family eats, this particular recipe was barely enough to feed about 4 people. I know that I will make it again, but I will have to double the amounts to feed my family of 5.

Too much work for the flavors. I had to add Worcestershire sauce, better than bullion beef stock, kosher chicken broth, cooking sherry and about 3 cups of water (1/2 cup at a time) over the course of 2 hours of stirring and stirring. I did all the tricks too, browned butter to brown orzo, garlic, green onions... Jeez this was tough to make it good. If-- and that is a big if-- I ever make this again, I will par boil the orzo in very salty water, then put into brown butter in the pan. It took forever to tendering, then the orzo seemed slimy to me. I'll stick with cold orzo salads from now on. Way too much work, and the time spent wasn't reflected in the taste.

Quick and easy. I used leeks instead of pearl onions.  The leeks were very fresh and I did not feel like messing with fresh pearl onions. Delicious!  Made it as a side for my girlfriend for Mother's Day.  Will make again soon!

I have made this excellent recipe twice this week.  I cut the butter in half the second time around and feel 1/2 the butter is plenty. I did not use any water. First go around I used organic low sodium chicken broth and white wine. Second time I only used the chicken broth. I also doubled the mushrooms and used fresh baby bellas and 1/2 of a vidalia onion instead of the pearl. The teenagers are huge fans!

This has become a regular appearance on our dinner table. My picky nephews even ask for seconds! I have made it as written; however, I have settled on a few changes: fresh garlic, baby bella mushrooms, beef stock in stead of water, and mix in sour cream with the parmesan.

I made this recipe and it turned out great.  I did a couple of changes. I used chopped onions and chopped garlic. I used only 2 tablespoons of butter for the entire recipe and approximately 3/4 of a pound of mushrooms that I needed to use up. Like many reviewers I substituted 1 can of chicken stock for the water. It came out creamy and delicious.  I will be making this again

This is AMAZING! We make this all the time.
To reduce calories we don't add the cheese and it still tastes phenomenal.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I found that all of the cooking instructions worked perfectly. I did, however substitute 1/4 diced sweet onion for the pearl onions, used about 1 1/2 cups of sliced and diced baby bellas, and when the recipe calls for parsley and cheese, I also added some freshly cooked English peas that I had lying around (I would leave these out next time since they interrupted the creamy nature of the dish).

I think it needs to cook longer for the orzo not to be crunchy.  More like 12 minutes or so more (once you've put the orzo in).

I had some orzo I wanted to use up, and decided to try this recipe.  Instead of half a cup of wine and one cup of water, I used one cup of no salt added chicken broth and half a cup of water.  What an excellent side dish!  Ridiculously easy and full of flavour.  Will definitely be making again.

We both loved this dish. As soon as I saw the review that used the water from reconstituted  dried mushrooms I knew that this is what I would be making. I had a small packet of dried porcini mushrooms , 10g.  I cut the butter way back to one tbs and used one tbs of olive oil. I didn't have  pearl onions and don't really care for them so I used two larger shallots. I also used  one large clove of fresh garlic instead of the powder. We love mushrooms so I added one cup of roughly chopped cremini's. I forgot to add the parmesan cheese. Great dish that is similar to risotto without all of the stirring. I served this with pan seared salmon and Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar, also from this site.

This was absolutely amazing!!! This will be a repeat in my house. The only tweak I did was I used one portobello mushroom, chopped. I believe this added more mushroom flavor. I had to add another splash of water and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Highly recommend as my family drooled over this side dish.

This turned out to be an extremely flavorful recipe, but I obviously changed the flavor profiles since I did not have white wine on hand. Like others, I used a white onion rather than pearl onions; fresh garlic; baby portobellas; and less butter.

Instead, of 1/4 cup of white wine, I used the lemon juice from one lemon and topped that with vegetable broth until I got to 1/4 cup of liquid. And I had more orzo on hand than the recipe calls for (about 1 1/4 cups), so I used all of it and then an additional 1 1/2 cups of water. I probably could have gotten away with using less. After bringing it to a boil, I added fresh thyme to the pot. This resulted in a very delicious, lemony, thyme-y dish!

Regardless, this is a pretty good method to cooking orzo and mushrooms. The mushrooms came out tender and the orzo fluffy. I would definitely make it again. I'd just suggest watching to see how much liquid/dry pasta you might need.

Like other reviewers I used 1.5 cups of homemade chicken broth.  0.5 cup of white wine.  I used twice as many mushrooms.   LOVE MUSHROOMS.  I picked up a .lb of wild mushrooms (variety of portobello, chanterelle, porcini, etc).    I will use less butter next time as well.  Added 1/2 tsp of dried thyme along with the broth/wine.  DELISH.  I will be making this again with less butter and instead of white wine I will used chicken broth and marsala.

This was amazing. I used chicken stock instead of the wine and water, and used onion powder because my boyfriend can't eat onions. So full of flavor. The trick is cooking it low and slow. Will keep in my file of favorites!

Made this last night and it was really good! It was creamy like a risotto. I cut the recipe in half, and then tried to scale back on the butter as other reviewers recommended. I skipped the onions because I'm not a fan. Also I used chicken broth instead of water. Yum! My only cooking tip is to watch the orzo and stir often so it doesn't start to burn... somehow I always have this problem.

This recipe was a great base. I used chopped white onion in place of pearl onion, and fresh garlic cloves in place of garlic powder. I sauteed the chopped garlic and onion in an appropriate amount of EVOO rather than butter. When I added the liquid I used broth rather than water, Reisling wine, and estimated the amount of butter to add. Also I used about a pound of baby bellas - you can never have too many mushrooms. It ended up simmering (on low with the top on) for 20-25 minutes until the liquid was absorbed and the orzo was very soft. It came out GREAT!!!!

I never thought I'd say "too much butter," but here it is, even though I reduced the butter a little already. I'm sure reducing it more will blow this up to five starts.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a non-cholesterol version with some ingredient substitutions:  using Benecol instead of butter, scallions instead of pearl onions, minced garlic instead of garlic powder,  and not including the parmesan.

Soooo delicious!  I added extra mushrooms and used fresh shredded parmesan cheese. I also used organic whole wheat orzo. I've made it twice in the last three days. We just can't get enough.

Great recipe which will definitely be repeated again. I used two tablespoons of garlic butter and some olive oil to cook the onions. Didn't have fresh parmesan on hand so I used the dry stuff that comes in the shaker bottle, worked out great. Still salivating at the thought of it

I only use a 1/4 cup of butter. I also use chicken broth of veggie broth instead of water. I add 1 cup mushrooms. I don't salt it since there is Parmesan cheese, which give enough salt. I'm sure the recipe in its original would be great too. Thanks for sharing

Okay, I made a number of changes, but I think I still got the gist of this recipe.  I used a whole package of mushrooms.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and fresh garlic instead of powdered as other reviewers recommended.  I reduced the parmesan to 1/4 of a cup. and the butter to 6T.  This turned out very good.  My family loved it!  I didn't have orzo, but I did have cut spaghetti so I used that and cooked it as if it were risotto (small amounts of liquid added and absorbed before adding more liquid).  I think this would work well with short grain rice, arborio (risotto) rice, orzo, or the cut spaghetti.  I also think it is very good without the parmesan if you don't have any on hand.  I can't wait to make it again to serve with steak and asparagus.  Yum!  All in all, a great recipe to tweak to your own taste.

I left out the onions because they are unpopular at my house. To replace some flavor I threw fresh sage in with the melting butter before I started cooking the mushrooms. It was perfect, easy to put together, and I will definitely make it again.

I made this tonight as a side dish for country style ribs. It was a very friendly and forgiving recipe, as I didn't have the wine or fresh parsley or pearl onions. I also changed up the order, sauteing the mushrooms until done b4 adding the orzo. Some reviewers said it took a lot more time and liquid, but I didn't find that to be true. Could the brand of orzo make a difference? In any case, I used 16 oz of orzo, but kept the amount of butter the same (less fat.) I used about 1 c. of diced frozen onion and a low sodium chicken stock concentrate mixed with the water instead of wine. I added a cube of frozen chopped basil to sub for the parsley, 2 fresh frozen garlic cubes instead of dried, a whole package of sliced mushrooms, and a container of shredded grand cru instead of parmesan. I added 3 cups of water (since I doubled the pasta) and put a lid on the skillet, letting it simmer on low for about 5 minutes while I made cole slaw and threw some frozen steamer peas into the microwave. It was sticking badly when I got back to it so I added another cup of water and managed to scrape it off and keep going. After that I left the lid off and stirred pretty constantly for no more than 5 more minutes, tested the pasta and found it done. Added fresh ground black pepper with the cheese, and voila! It wasn't a spectacular flavor but it was yummy, creamy, comfort food, a great foil for the bbq ribs. I am adding this to our regular rotation! Quick and easy. :)

I made this tonight not knowing what to expect, but to my surprise it was very good.  I took others suggestions and used Chicken Broth, I used 3/4 cup and 1/2 cup of water.  I used diced yellow onion and left out the cheese. I also added more of the seasoning in order to get it the taste that I wanted.   All and all, it was very filling.  The next time I will add some chicken make a one pot meal.  Thanks Babarclay

WOW!  This was even better than expected, even though I forgot the Parmesan (grated it and then left it in the fridge--out of sight, out of mind).  The dish is so simple to make, yet it turned out elegant and very flavorful.  I didn't have white wine, so I used 1 cup of beef broth and 1/2 cup water.  I also used yellow onion and only 2 Tbsp of butter to reduce the fat content. This dish is a definite keeper.  Now, I have to make it again to try it with the cheese.

Love this recipe! Very yummy! I make it all the time with fish. I only use half the amount of  butter, because it is a little greasy with the 1/2c. called for in the recipe.

I was really disappointed, and I wish I had read ALL reviews before making this dish.  It is really bland, and that much butter didn't help.  I'll try to tweak it by changing from broth to water, use olive oil, fresh garlic, and maybe some sausage, but I'm not hopeful.  I much prefer our regular risottos!

Great recipe! Made as shown only doubled mushrooms (because we love 'em). This was just yummy! Good next day too. Might reduce the butter for personal preference but otherwise A+. Thanks!  Will make again real soon.

Great recipe.  I modified it slightly, but it came out excellent.  I used about 1/3 diced white onion instead of the pearl onion. I omitted the wine and instead used 1 1/4 cups of water.  I cooked it for about 8 minutes and that was just right.  My only complaints are that there is an obscene amount of butter used and I only got about 4 servings (at most) out of it. Also, not enough mushrooms.  I used 2/3 cup chopped portabellos and will mostly double that next time.  Definitely a winner though.  It was a great side dish for the salmon I made.

Overall this was a great recipe but it did take twice as much water (I used chicken broth) as stated as well as longer to cook. But very simple and delicious! Will be making again.

Oh yes...this is a keeper!  One could certainly cut back on the butter, but that would only be for your waistline's peace of mind :)  The only changes I made were to saute some garlic prior to adding the onions, which were red since that's what I had.

Delicious!  So yummy, quick and easy.  I'm on a mission to use up pantry and freezer items this week, and this fit the bill.  I halved the recipe to 1/2 cup orzo, and used chicken broth and dry sherry I had in the fridge.  I used a can of sliced mushrooms from the pantry and some shredded italian cheese I had to use.  Lots of pepper.  This was amazing!  Just think what this would be with fresh mushrooms and good quality parm.  It's a do-over for sure.  Thanks for sharing with AR!

Love the recipe. I used beef broth instead of water (you can probably use chicken broth too). Instead of pearl onions, I chopped up a sweet onion. The dish was delicious!!

nice dish, for sure. made with red wine and portobello mushrooms b/c that's what i had on hand, which gave the dish a deep, rich flavour. i also used 1 C vegetable stock + 1/2 C extra water for cooking the orzo. i made it as a vegetarian meal with french bread; it's probably better suited as a side with meat.

Boiled orzo.  Used 5-6 oz mushrooms cooked in 4 oz butter w/ onion, then combined.

This is awesome!  I made it for a Christmas party side dish to do something different.  There was very little left and the hostess was happy to keep it to eat the next day!  Thank you very much for the recipe!

This was wonderful! I have told all of my friends about it.  So good, so easy and so tasty.  I didn't use the pearl onions, instead I used scallions and button mushrooms. The butter and wine made it.  It was so good there were NO left overs.

This recipe was awesome! Like a mini-Risoto! I also used chicken stock instead of water, and  because I added asparagus and chopped chicken breast, I added about 1.5 cups more broth to the pasta, and cooked it about twice as long. No big deal, just be prepared in case this happens to you. I will definatley be making this again...I almost liked this more than the traditional risoto, a little less starchy and heavy.

Definitely make it in a skillet as they recommend, or if you have nonstick saucepans that would work, too.  I made it in a stainless saucepan and had to stir almost constantly or it kept sticking.  My fault! Also, according to personal preference, I would decrease the wine...but I really love mushrooms so I prefer to have their flavor be foremost and I felt like the wine took over a bit.

I used about a third the amount of butter and it still tasted fantastic--the full amount would have been overpoweringly rich, I think.  Did use chicken broth instead of water, per other reviewers' suggestions.  Keeping this recipe!

But I halfed the butter and added double the mushrooms.  I also only added 1/4 onion and added parmesan and feta. I also added 1/2 C. of quinoa.  Very yummy!

I really enjoyed this. Didn't have pearl onions, so used chopped vidalia. Had some shiitake mushrooms on hand, so used those. Although the end result was quite good, I think I would've preferred this without using the wine. It had too strong of an aftertaste and kind of cancelled out the other flavors rather than enhancing them.

Delicious, but I agree that the butter could be cut in half, and it would still be good.  Also, I substituted I clove of minced garlic for the garlic powder; I added it with the pearl onions and sauteed it with them.

Absolutely delicious. Made substitutuions based on previous reviews and what I had available. Subbed regular onions for pearl and used half the butter (still very rich). Used chicken broth in place of water/wine but added about 3 tablespoons wine vinegar (read somewhere that diluting water with wine vinegar would be a good substitute). Everyone loved it.

Really delicious. I cut back a little on the butter, used red onion instead of pearl, fresh garlic instead of powder and omitted the parmesan. Turned out great! Wine flavour really comes through.

Love this recipe!!  It was dripping butter when I made it the first time with the amount called for and was way too much butter for me.  I have made this about 10 times since and used only 1/2 the butter.  I added a little more wine to make sure there was enough liquid.  I will continue to make it again and again.

Like every good allrecipes reader, I checked out the reviews before starting this dish, and these are my modifications (not that the original had anything wrong with it): No pearl onions, so I just cut up two small regular yellow ones and sauteed them with sliced mushrooms with olive oil and butter. At the same time, I roasted some asparagus to add, just because I love it and was using the oven anyway. When both were done I set them aside and I toasted the orzo in butter and olive oil until it was well coated, then added 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of white wine, adding more when the liquid disappeared so that it was all absorbed and the flavors vibrant. Then I threw the veggies back in the orzo and did the Parmesan on individual plates, to taste. Yum!

I get weirded out by melted Parmesan. Once, on a recipe like this, but not this one at all, I let the Parmesan sit in the heating dish and it got thick and gloopy and kind of hard and I nearly stopped consuming cheese for awhile, because I kept picturing it in my arteries.

Such a delicious dish!! I used a dried exotic mushroom mix instead of fresh mushrooms, and instead of water I used chicken broth and used a half of a regular chopped yellow onion, but followed the rest of the recipe. The fancy mushrooms added a nice richness, and a depth of flavor. A great side or main vegetarian dish (if you use the water only course).

I wish I could give this 10 stars!  I took the basic recipe and altered it a bit.  Less butter (1/4 c.) because I used unstrained homemade chicken broth. I forgot all about the parmesan but didn't miss it due to the richness from the broth.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks   BARBARCLAY!

This side dish is to die for! I made the recipe as is, with a few slight modifications. I used less butter (margarine), used regular cooking onions, and I use at least 3-4 cups of sliced mushrooms. I'm very conscious of the vegetables I cook with so I try to add as many as I can. I started using just white mushrooms but then started added a bit of the other varieties. mmmmmm! definitely a favorite in our house

We love this!  Even though I had less Parmesan and parsley than called for, and I used small onions from our garden because that is what I had on hand, it tasted fantastic.  I used a Chardonnay and it was perfect.  The only problem was the serving size seemed to be on the small side but that left us wanting more so I'll be making this again soon!  Great recipe, I highly recommend it.

Very good!  I did add 1/2 cup more water, cooking time was about 12 min.  I had fresh garlic on hand so I added 1 tsp minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Added more mushrooms too.  1/2 cup didn't seem like enough.  Family loved it.  Will definitly make again!

Good, but not outstanding. Not enough liquid in the original recipe, ended up almost doubling it.  I know there has to be a way to reduce the amount of butter...way too much.  It's a good start to orzo dish, just needs some tweeking

This is my new favorite recipe! I used one shallot finely choped, rough chopped two cloves of garlic, and rough choped sliced baby portebello mushrooms. I also used chicken broth in place of water. This recipe was so easy and so delicious my family asked me to make it again the next night!

Loved this quick and delicious side - we love mushrooms - so I probably used closer to 1 cup. Also, I didn't have any pearl onions on hand, just used 1/3 cup or so of a sweet yellow onion. Easy & impressive taste - thanks Babarclay!

This was a hit at my house. I used chicken broth instead of the wine and it was great.

I had left over orzo from the night before and found this recipe.  It was fantastic, I just cooked it all up and then tossed in the already cooked orzo. I added some sliced black olives to the mix.  It was really, really good and there are a lot of things you can do with this recipe.

Wow.  This was REALLY good stuff.  I used fresh garlic and chopped red onion instead of pearl onions, and left out the parsley.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was out of this world.  Thanks@

Very yummy but not for those on a diet.  An entire stick of butter is more than I like to use.  But for the holidays or a special treat, it was good.

Very tasty! I used only 1 TBS of butter (was plenty) 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion & 2 small diced garlic cloves.  I'm a mushroom fan, so I used about 1/2 lb of sliced mushrooms. They shrink when you cook them so they didn't overtake the dish. I forgot the cheese, but it was still a very yummy dish and lovely compliment to the rest of the meal.

Oh my goodness, yummy!  I did use chicken broth instead of water, chopped onions instead of pearl (bcs I'm lazy) and canned mushrooms (bcs my fresh ones had gone bad - would be even better with fresh).  Next time will replace wine with chicken broth bcs hubby doesn't like.  Thanks!!

This recipe was just okay for me.  I followed the directions exactly (only using half of the amount of butter called for), but it didn't "wow" me like it did others.

Really yummy but as everyone else said... way too much butter.  The orzo almost slipped off my spoon.  I know we would enjoy it better if we had used perhaps half the butter called for.  Great taste though!!

Like so many others suggested I cut way back on the butter and used chicken broth instead of wine, but great recipe otherwise.  Even the picky eater in my house loved it and went back for seconds.  Will use again soon.

My whole family and I really liked this. Such a change of pace from my usual plain white rice or rice-a-roni side dish. Only thing I substituted was the onions. Used chopped yellow onion instead of pearl,(I didn't have any on hand)This one's a keeper, thanks!

I loved this. It is simple and a nice break from my normal side of "brown rice with butter and salt." Would be nice to serve to company, but simple enough as a weeknight family side dish.

With a little tweaking, this recipe has become my husband's hands-down favorite.  He would eat the entire pan if I let him!  I lay off the butter a little bit and I'm extra generous with the garlic seasoning and parmeseaan cheese (I grate it fresh) at the end.  Delicious!

Good, but not as flavorful as other orzo recipes we like.  It was very easy to make and would compliment a heavily spiced meat.  Just not as bold as we are used to.  I'm glad we tried it though!

This was a great way to use up a huge box of local shittake mushrooms!  Very delicious. After reading the other reviews, I too made some changes.  I used vegetable broth instaed of chicken broth since that's all I had on hand.  Next time I will use WAY less butter or maybe evoo instead.  I'd also try to make it healthier by adding more veggies.  I'd also like to try adding shrimp or scallops!!

I was very disappointed in this dish after all the rave reviews.  The wine gave it almost a sour taste that I found unpleasant, even though I generally like the taste of wine in cooking.  I did follow the recipe as written, with the exception of using chicken broth in place of the water as others suggested. Hubby didn't care for it either.  Sorry, will not be making again.

Terrific recipe. We made it straight from Barbarclay's recipe the first night and it was so good we made it again as a side dish for the next night. Sub'd in regular onion, added 1 cup of chicken broth, and we didn't have white wine so we used 1/4 cup sherry and mixed water in for the 1/2 cup white wine. it was even better this time. I've added this recipe to our standard line-up. Well done!

I used baby portabella mushrooms, substituted arugula for parsley, and used feta cheese instead of Parmesan. I also reduced the butter to just a few tablespoons and slowly added chicken stock to the orzo as it cooked.  Turned out great!

This had 5 star taste but I'm only giving 4 stars because I had to make changes.  I went with the other reviewers suggestions.  I used only 2 T of butter, a medium sized regular onion that I browned with 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  I used a full cup of wild mushrooms and no garlic powder.  I only put in about 1/4 c of fresh grated parmesan. It was fabulous and a keeper.

I used this recipe as a base and added some things.  I didn't have pearl onions so just chopped some onions up and used chicken broth instead of water.  I added some chopped roasted red peppers and chopped tomatoes.    It turned out wonderful and was so fresh and a nice side dish to our pork and chicken dinner.  Everyone loved it, it will definitely go into rotation.

I'm giving this a four because it needed a little tweaking but all in all this was a great recipe! It definitely needs more liquid than called for. My modifications are listed below:  1. changes to the base: I used one shallot b/c i didn't have pearl onions and i browned it in mostly olive oil (and a little bit of butter) with chopped fresh garlic.  2. Used crushed tomatoes: because i didn't have mushrooms (which are big flavor boosters), i added a little bit of crushed tomatoes when i threw the water and wine in. Additionally, any time the orzo needed more liquid, i mixed half crushed tomatoes, half water and added.  3. threw in a bouillon cube (chicken) with the water and wine. did not add any salt.  all in all, it turned out great! if i had the mushrooms, i would not have used the tomatoes but they were a great spin on this recipe and went well with all other ingredients.

I made this recipe the way it was done and I liked it and my hubby thought it was "okay". We both said it used to much butter. (I should've  listen to the other reviews.) I will do this again but tweek it to our tastes. I am glad I did try this and thank you BABARCLAY for sharing this with us.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was soooo yummy the next day. I used about half the amount of butter and added a tiuch of oil. I used diced onions. My only recommendation would be to add 3/4c of chicken broth and 3/4c of white wine. You can taste the wine in the recipe, but I like a little more of a kick. I did not add the parsley, becasue I didn;t have any, but it's probably not even needed. Nice recipe.

This was very good.  Like others suggested, I cut the butter in half and it turned out wonderfully.  For a different twist, I added lemon juice and lemon pepper, and it was just as good.  This can be adapted endlessly, and my favorite so far is adding shrimp, broccoli, and peas.  Delicious!

I cooked this in an cast iron skillet, and it turned out great. I used half a yellow onion in place of the pearls, and brown criminis for the mushrooms.  In the future, I would use half the butter as it was more oily than I like, and I will add more mushrooms (1 cup).

Nice side dish. Required about 3x the amount of liquid suggested. I had some cream in the fridge so I used a mix of white wine, cream and chicken broth. Used less butter and cheese and it still turned out creamy and delicious.

Delicious recipe.  I had bought a bag of multi-colored, organic orzo from a discount store and needed to find a recipe since I had never cooked orzo before.  This was a hit with everyone in my family.  I only had red wine on hand so I used it, but will definitely use the white wine called for next time.  It was still delicious, but white wine would definitely taste better.

Really enjoyed this recipe and the possibilities for variations are endless. As I only had red wine to hand I followed another members tip and added a tin of tomatoes, also used olive oil and only 1/4 cup. That said, I am looking forward to trying it with full complement of butter, white wine and maybe a little cream for good measure...

This was my first attempt at cooking Orzoa and I couldn't have found a better recipe to learn with. It was a big hit in the house and I'll be sure to make this again.  I'm already planning on ways to make it a main course by adding chicken breasts to it. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was a great find. I also used chicken broth instead of water, and canned mushrooms instead of fresh. I added sausag to it to make it a meal, and a tablespoon of heavy cream to it to make it a little thicker when it was finished. It was so good.

This recipe was okay. I followed the directions except using chopped onion instead of the pearls. I think adding some more flavorful ingredients such as fresh herbs would give this recipe the boost it needs.

Excellent! Did not have pearl so  used chopped onion. Also used stock in place of the water. Parsley is optional in my opinion. I forgot to add it once and it wasnt missed.

I used this recipe as a guideline for what I actually made.  I didn't have any wine on hand so I just made it without it.  I subbed low sodium chicken broth for the water and added fresh garlic.  I'm pretty sure the wine would have made it superb however I didn't have any on hand.  Update: I made the recipe with the addition of wine and fresh garlic. YUM! 4.5 stars.

This was the first time that I made orzo. I had some mushrooms that I needed to use up so the search is over. I will definately make again. I did double the recipe and added some beef stock instead of the H20. Didn't have any parsley and that was not missed. The added touch of the walnuts gave it great texture.
Makes a  great side dish or a meal in itself. 
Thanks for a great way to use orzo.

I made this last night and it was delicous.  I made a few changes.  Used more sliced mushrooms, used fresh minced garlic added with the mushrooms, used chicken broth instead of water and added 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas at the end for color. I did need to add a bit more broth for the orzo to cook properly but my stove was probably on too high.

this was absolutely the best - it's one of those reciped you wished you would have doubled so you could have "plenty" of leftovers - I served 4 and had very little left !  I also added a tsp. of chick bouillon.  and I used shallots, rather than onions. !

This was really good!   Easy too, and didn't require the oven...just what I was looking for.  I peeled and shredded a zucchini and sauteed briefly with the mushrooms for added veggie nutrition.  You couldn't even see it in there!  I  used beef broth since I served this with grilled sirloin. And for the leftovers, I  sauteed red bell pepper and shredded carrot and then added the orzo to the skillet for a tasty Orzo Pilaf lunch!

This is very flavorful and not too tough to make.  I did put in extra mushrooms and used chicken bullion like many reviewers suggested.  I didn't like the parsley.  I know it added some color, but I don't think it was the right flavor to add.

This was fantastic.  I did cut the butter in half and used diced onions and fresh garlic.  I also cut the wine by 1/3 and used vegetable broth instead of water.  Served with Cheesy Turkey Meatloaf from this site and roasted baby eggplants with herbs.  A huge hit with the family!

This is a very tasty recipe.  Per some of the reviews, I used chicken broth instead of water and I will probably reduce the white wine next time and add more of the broth.  Maybe it was just my wine, but my husband and I thought it tasted too strong in it.  I will make this again!

Talk about a tasty, quick and rewarding accompaniment dish.  Like many others I substituted the pearl onions for regular onions and added garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also added asparagus to give the dish some colour and different texture.  My husband and daughter loved it too - result !!!

Loved, loved, loved this!!!  I doubled the recipe to ensure I had enough for my dinner party.  Per some other reviewers, I used chicken broth in place of the water and way more mushrooms.  I sauteed a few cloves of minced garlic in about 1 tbsp of butter (left out onions, personal pref).  Added the orzo, mini portabella mushrooms and only a bit more butter (no where close to what is called for, don't think it's necessary) then followed the recipe as stated.  So creamy and full of flavour, a great compliment to my pancetta wrapped pork roast...YUMMY!

This is delicious.  I also used vegetable broth and chopped onion.  I used baby bella mushrooms (2 small cartons because we LOVE mushrooms).  This was a side dish for a meal I cooked for a new neighbor.  They called to tell me how much they loved the dinner, especially the mushroom orzo!!

This is one of our favories! Based on the feedback of others I also substituted chicken broth for the water. I can't even count how many times I have made this dish and have passed along the recipe to many!

Good recipe! I agree - a little on the greasy side, though. Recommend using half the butter or substituting with something else. Chicken broth would boost the flavour instead of water.

Very simple, I would choose this over risotto, because of it's simplicity.  I used chopped sweet onions instead of pearl onions.  Next time I make it I will try a bit of cream to finish it for added richness.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We used fat free reduced sodium chicken broth in place of the water.  We also used 1/2 of a yellow onion chopped up instead of pearl onions as that is what we had.  Other than that followed recipe exactly.  It was creamy and very tasty.  Will make again!

Outstanding. Enjoyed by my whole family. I made one substitution; instead of parsley I added fresh basil. Wow! Reminded me of a risotto recipe I make, but a whole lot easier.

I played a game of find the orzo to make this dish. It's not totally unobtainable in the part of the UK I live in but it's not easy to find. I did eventually find it in the international aisle of Tescos. My friend cookinme recommended this to me and I pretty much went with the changes she made. I diced half an onion, used vegetable stock instead of the water and used more mushrooms. This was delicious, even my youngest daughter who doesn't like mushrooms ate a reasonable amount. Many thanks.

This was fantastic!  I made it a little differently- I used 1/2 of a large sweet onion, diced and 2.5 cups of whole wheat pasta.  Since I used more pasta, I also added more wine and water (1.5 C water and 3/4C wine).  It was so delicious!  I'll definitely make it again.  I'm not sure if all of the butter is necessary- you might be able to cut back to reduce the fat content a bit.

This is GREAT.  Really delicious way to serve orzo with practically any main dish.  I agree this is better than risotto and fairly fail-safe.  Have made it for company and everyone went back for seconds.

Added more broth (instead of water) as it cooked, like a risotto. Used more onion than called for. Nice side dish with chicken and a salad.

Very easy & tasty. Not many changes needed, but per many suggestions, I did use chicken broth instead of water. Also next time I will reduce the amount of butter by half.

I liked this a lot but it took a lot longer than the recipe stated.  It needed to simmer for 30 min.  Looks good and it's nice and creamy!

We loved this. I used less wine and a little chicken broth. Also, I cut the butter in half and could have even used a little less. It was so good! I will definitely make this again.

This was great!!!  I did make a few minor alterations.  I can never seem to make and recipe as is!  I always change it slightly!!!  I used half the amount of butter it called for, used chicken broth instead of the water, used red onion (that's what I had on hand) and omitted the parmesan cheese because the white wine gave is such a nice flavor I didn't want to alter it!  Excellent side dish!
