I've been making these for 12 years since I first saw the recipe in the TOH May/June 2001 issue (a LONG time ago lol). The only difference is I don't cut them in half and I serve them on top of ramen noodles that have been colored with a drop of green food coloring. The recipe in the magazine was called, 'Octopus and Seaweed'. My kids love this!

What a fun way to do hotdogs.  The kids loved them.  If you cut them the wrong way, as we did with one, it looks like a palm tree.   Hubby said he would prefer his served on a sea of chili next time.

I grew up on these things... i've been having them for approx. 30 years now! Heck, I even make them when i'm having hotdogs alone sometimes at home... this is a recipe that will never leave my repertoire and will be passed on to the generations ;)

Not a fan of boiled hotdogs as they tend to loose flavor. 2/3 kids liked them and would eat them again. Easy fun way to prepare hotdogs for school lunch using a Thermos. I used Hebrew National hotdogs which are narrow and difficult to cut eight legs, but the coarse real meat, once cooked, looked like the tentacles had suckers all over them!

My 3-year old just loved these! He already likes hot dogs but making crazy animals with them just made it more fun. Thanks for the great idea!

I started making these in 1989 when my kids were little and now make them for the grandkids. I cut in eyes and a smile which open up when boiled.  I serve them on a bed of spinach noodles with cauliflower and broccoli  “coral”. I have found through the years that the cheaper hot dogs curl better than more expensive, all beef dogs.

Like Jayelle I found these in Taste of Home years ago and made them for my grandkids.  I also used tinted Ramen noodles .  It is a cute idea.  Don't remember if the grandkids really liked them but it made a cute display.  I only have it a three rating because I thought  it was  a little trouble to make.  Nothing wrong with the recipe, I just wouldn't do it  unless it was a special occasion.

My grandsons LOVED these.  I set one over a bowl of chili, and the other on top of the hot dog bun.  So cute.
