These were great. I added the spicy red pepper jelly in place of the chopped peppers. They were  great hit and were all gone in short order. I will make them again and the glaze could be used on many other appies!

Prepared exactly as per directions except a) I used egg beaters and b) I just minced one 3 inch long Jalapeno pepper (no measuring)- browned them in a fry pan like it says- put them on a paper towel to cool & degrease a little (there was very little) then placed them on wax paper and stuck them in a baggie and then into the freezer for a couple of days. The night before Xmas dinner- took them out of the freezer & into the fridge then the next morning I warmed the meatballs in about  a cup of simmering chicken stock in a covered fry pan for about 20 minutes, added the rest of the glaze ingredients (plus another splash of stock) and heated thru and then put everything in a crock pot set on high for a little more than an hour when I tested a meatball & since it was cooked thru I put them out to be served. They were a big hit & got several compliments and a couple of recipe requests (especially when people found out that they were low-fat). If you're going to finish them in a crock pot add a little extra broth or stock (or I would think orange juice would work too) and keep an eye on them because the glaze WILL thicken

This was so yummy for a holiday party I threw! But I changed things up quite a bit:
1. because of lack of time, I used Costco meatballs instead of making my own.
2. I made my own cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving and had so much leftover that I used it for this recipe too: bag of cranberries, one cup of orange juice, one cup of sugar, one Cutie zested and squeezed into a pot. Bring to a boil for about 45 minutes, then let simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool.
3. I added paprika, pepper flakes and juice from pickled jalapenos.
4. I put everything in my crockpot for about 4 hours before the party.

It all turned out amazing! Just a little spice, but it was subtle.

I liked this idea, but as written the thyme (in poultry seasoning) is too strong and the orange rind in the marmalade is too bitter.  I won't make this again as is.

I made these meatballs for the new year party. Everyone was raving about them! Really great for a party and easy to make! I did not change anything, the sauce is really tasty. My family requested to make them again soon and serve them with basmati
rice.

After reading the reviews, I couldn't believe people changed the recipe so much it wasn't even the same and then gave theirs  a rave review. One gal even used frozen store brought meatballs and changed the sauce recipe as well. Please readers either follow the recipe or don't give it a bad review. It was wonderful as written!!

This was really yummy although I changed out the orange marmalade for home made apricot jam and it was better that way.

These were soooo good for being turkey. I baked the meatballs at 350 degrees for 20 minutes (turning once) and made the sauce in a saucepan instead. I had other appetizers to cook before guests arrived for Xmas at my house and omitted the frying pan portion.  I transferred it all to a slow cooker to cook on low for one hour. I would recommend letting the sauce reduce to your liking before putting them in the slow cooker.

I made this on Super Bowl day.  My husband loved it but I am not sure the rest of them did or not....I personally like the beef meatballs better....
It seemed to be something was missing....

These are great.  One of my guests blurted out "these meatballs are REALLY good!  And I don't even usually like meatballs!".  Agree with him - these don't have that syrupy texture and flavor that most cocktail meatballs have.

I loved the suggestion to make the meatballs ahead of time and then just heat in the sauce on the day of the party.

These are totally phenomenal!  They take a little while to brown in the skillet, but other than that it's pretty easy and such a hit.  I used spiced turkey that I use when I make lasagna and I think that upped the spice ante.  I also did not use the hot peppers themselves but instead added some hot pepper jelly.  They are a big big hit!!

I took a short cut and used only the sauce on store-bought meatballs. A few hours in the crockpot and they were fabulous!

I made these for our Black Friday tree-trimming party. They are good, but I prefer the version with the chili sauce + grape ketchup, which surprised me a lot bc orange marmalade is my favorite jelly/jam. I think the lack of ketchup flavor is what I missed, weirdly enough. I may try this again another year with 2-4 tbsp of ketchup (or chili sauce) to help add that tomato flavor that I'm missing, bc I *LOVE* the orange flavor. P.S. If your complaint is that the orange is too bitter, try buying a better brand of marmalade for any recipe in the future. Cheap brands get pith in it, and then it's kinda gross. Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as written, using ground turkey breast. My meatballs were heavy and hard as rocks, perhaps because of the very low fat content of the turkey, but the flavor was pretty good--not cloyingly sweet as I thought it might be. I've had better luck using cooked quinoa instead of breadcrumbs in turkey meatballs. It seems to make them lighter.

Delicious!! It took a bit more time than I thought it would to pan-cook them, but maybe I was just going slow from being on unfamiliar turf.  I used crushed Ritz-type crackers instead of breadcrumbs.  Refrigerating the meat mix for a little while prior to rolling into balls did help with working with the meat. Well worth the effort though. A great party food!

I have already made these however with a different twist, instead of marmalade I use chili sauce and it give it just that little umph that spicy is all about if you like it hotter you can always add pepper flakes.

I started looking for a cocktail-sized turkey meatball recipe because my local grocery stores no longer carry the ready-made brand I like.  This recipe was simple and SO good.  I didn't make the sauce but served them with roasted pineapple habanero sauce - fantastic!  I used the video's idea and used my small scoop to make exactly 49 meatballs.  I will absolutely make this recipe again and again.

I did not add any of the heat to this recipe, my family likes their food tame.  The meatballs were very good, I added a little chili powder instead of cayenne b/c that is what I could find.  Since I didn't add the jalapeno peppers to the sauce, I would add more chili powder or heat to the meatballs.  The sauce was very good.  Almost too sweet.  Next time I might cut back a little on the marmalade.  I served it over rice and it fed 5 people.

I tried this for a church function.  I doubled the recipe and served them in my crockpot.  In less than 10 min. they were all gone and I had MANY requests for both the recipe and MORE MORE MORE.
OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Thanks a lot for a real keeper. The only problem is I didn't hide any for myself.  Hindsight is always 20/20

This was a little strange at first taste but after you get used to it, it is quite a nice sweet/savoury treat! Was well-received at a potluck.

Delicious!  I liked it so much I may use this recipe for turkey burgers as well for a less time-consuming version.

I made these for New Year's Eve out of ground pork instead of turkey only because I don't care for turkey. I didn't have any ground chicken on hand. The sauce thickened up beautifully, glazing them, just as I'd hoped. These were a big hit and I'll definitely be making them again. Thank you for sharing!

I didn’t have the poultry seasoning for the recipe.  And didn’t add the jalapeño peppers.  I made them a little larger and served with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.

It was fun and easy. Tasted so great. I got 96% lean turkey from Walmart. It tasted like I was taking a bite of my turkey dinner with the taste of cranberry's with a hint of spiciness. I  did not put in the jalapenos or chili's but I did add some olive oil impregnated with jalapenos, so definitely tasted the jalapeno! Everyone loved them. Thank you so much. I plan to try several of your other recipes. Your videos are fun to watch and very educational for a novice cook.

love this recipe! all though the "ready in 35 mins" is a bit deceptive since you have to let em sit for an hour lol. I made these for a church potluck today, I did like a triple batch, and it was GONE. people had nothing but great things to say about em. definitely saving the recipe

I made a couple of changes by substituting ground Pork for Turkey as it was Christmas and we had turkey on the table for dinner. I also omitted the bread crumbs (fewer carbs) and everyone absolutely loved them. A double batch lasted less than 10 minutes

I made these for a new years day gathering. They were a big hit! I  made according to directions as best I could but had to make a couple changes due to not having a couple ingredients. I used apple jelly in place of orange marmelade, skipped the fresnos and used only jalepeno peppers, and I rolled the meatballs in flour before browning in olive oil.  I mixed the meat and seasonings and crushed ritz and milk (I only had panko crumbs) and left in the fridge overnight. I browned the meatbalss and simmered in the sauce right before putting in a crockpot for our gathering. Delicious!

Sadly, I had to omit both the cayenne and the chili peppers because my husband can't eat them. The heat would have suited my tastes much better, but when family members can't eat spicy food, they can't eat spicy food. Without the peppers, my husband loved them, but they were just meh for me. With the peppers, I would have loved them, but my husband wouldn't have been able to eat it at all. So 4 stars is an average to reflect both our tastes.

These were a big hit! I followed instructions except the frying the meatballs on the skillet, I started but quickly realized I needed to do it in batches so I put them in the oven at 400F until browned and made the glaze in a separate pot. They still turned out moist and delicious. I'll likely not make these very frequently due to their high sugar content, but they are okay for special occasions.

Used jalapeño jelly from Trader Joe´s instead of peppers. Served as main dish with brown rice and broccoli on the side. A big hit! I made it five or six times last holiday season and into early spring.

These are good - sweet but with a pleasing tart tang. I served them for supper, so I made them a bit larger and served it over rice. I didn't have time to refrigerate, so I added some more bread crumbs.

Oh my what a delight!!!! The only thing O  do next time is to only put half the marmalade only because I make my own homemade marmalade and it is quite a bit more flavorful than store bought. 

I tasted the turkey balls before putting them in the glaze and tgey were absolutely delicious at that stage too. This will definitely become a regular appetizer at Easter, thanks giving and Christmas season get together a. Thanks a ton Chef John!!!!

I have hesitated to write a review since taste is so subjective.  However, had everything on hand to make these for New Year's Eve.  Omitted poultry seasoning, personal preference, and substituted apricot jelly for marmalade, again personal preference.  Excellent.  Could have doubled the amount.  Sauce alone is delicious and could easily be used on other cuts of meat.  Enjoy!  Thanks Chef John

This will be the second year I am making these for the holidays. This year they were requested along with my chicken wings. My sister is super picky so when she actually likes something we make, we gladly oblige. This year I'm leaving the heat. Fingers crossed it goes well!

Have been wanting to make this recipe for ages...but...Never had all of the ingredients at one time.  Today I noticed that I had ground chicken & homemade cranberry sauce that needed use  before it was past its prime...and...decided to wing it with what I had on hand.   Thank you for providing a great jumping off point.

I made the recipe as directed,except I only had Orange  Cranberry marmalade so I used that instead of plain orange. I also did not use the peppers since I was feeding my 20 month old. She passed on it tonight but I thought it was really very good. Ground turkey tends to be so blah but this recipe jazzes it up and I dont miss the ground beef at all. Good job Chef john!

These are fabulous, I baked them instead cause I like crispy meatballs.  I sub'd stuffing mix instead of breadcrumbs for a Christmas taste for our potluck.  Also used raspberry jam instead of marmalade just personal preference.  Also added red pepper jelly to the glaze.  So Yummy, these are Definitely my go to meatballs from now on!!!!

Very nice meatballs, I decided to make these a little bigger and use them for a meatball sandwich.  Just had to bake them a little bit to cook the meat all the way through.

This was pretty good.  I'm going to have to make this again because I made it for a Christmas party and had them in the crockpot all day.  They didn't taste so well in the crockpot, but I'm sure these just need to be served fresh.  The sauce was a bit tart when I tasted it so I added a bit of sugar.  Thanks for the recipe, I will try it again and update my review when I do.

Made this just like the recipe and it was a real hit at a football party.  Actually helped the Broncos win over San Diego!

Delicious!  We considered using beef instead of turkey, but we followed the recipe as written and were really happy with the results.  The meatballs were moist and very tasty, and the sauce had just enough bite to it.  We'll make these again.

Very good!  I didn't have turkey but 2 lbs. ground chicken and used 1/2 c. apricot preserves and 1/4 c. orange marmalade and changed the servings to 12 servings.

Can you cook this in a slow-cooker?

My husband LOVED these meatballs...and we are not particularly fond of turkey.  I adjusted some of the spices for our taste, but we really liked the jalapeno in the sauce.  It added just the right pizzazz.  Next time I make them, I will have to double the batch...

My family and i loved it!! Would use less onions next time.  Also, used corn meal instead of bread crumbs since I'm allergic to wheat.  Made one mistake, I used cooked turkey, but it still worked!

Such a hit at a recent party. So tender and the sweet and sour combination was great.
