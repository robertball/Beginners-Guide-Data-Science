I thought this was pretty good, but just had to change it some based on what I had in the house. I only had about 2/3 of a container or ricotta and it worked fine. I also cut back the mozzarella by about half. I couldnt find my Italian seasoning and just sprinkled a little Goya adobo seasoning on the filling for flavor with some additional black pepper. I do not care for jarred sauce, so I just put some unsalted canned tomatoes in my blender with a pinch of garlic sauce and used that. Only other change was using just 1 egg. I only baked it about 20~25 minutes , added a little cheese then 5 or so minutes more.

Great recipe. I added a little more parmesan and sauce, but really, it didn't need any changes.

I wanted to love these, but I found them to be surprisingly bland (even with increasing the Italian seasoning, subbing (increased) garlic bread seasoning AND garlic salt (out of garlic powder), and adding crushed red pepper).  I also added some fresh mozz to the mix because I had some in need of use.  I forewent broiling and simply removed the foil and added the mozz for the final 10 minutes of baking.  My box of manicotti held 14 and this filled all w/1/2C or so leftover.  I'd have rated these a 3, myself, but Mr. LTH really enjoyed them, hence the "4".  If I make this again, I'll def up the filling seasonings.  THANKS for the recipe.

Just made this recently and it made enough for my husband and I to have for a second meal!  Even better the second time around!  I used a mix of Mario Batali's alfredo sauce (15 oz) and Paul Newman's alfredo sauce (15 oz).  I didn't have the amount needed written on my shopping list.  The extra sauce didn't hurt a thing, and the recipe was lovely even having it twice.  I definitely will add this to the family favorite meal list.
