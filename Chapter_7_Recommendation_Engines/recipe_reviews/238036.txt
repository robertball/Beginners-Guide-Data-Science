Easy to make breakfast treat, especially since I had decided I wanted corn meal mush (another name besides polenda and polenta!) for breakfast!  Frozen corn works instead of fresh in this dish. I garnished this with hot pepper and red onion rings. Great taste!  I'll be making this again.

Made this today to serve with Chef John's Pork ala Latte. Used fresh corn that I had previously frozen. Did not have polenta so used cornmeal added more salt and cayenne.
