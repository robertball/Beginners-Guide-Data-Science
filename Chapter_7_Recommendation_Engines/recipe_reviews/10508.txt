I’m giving 5 stars to the original Quaker Oatmeal Cookie Recipe.  The original Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie recipe from Quaker Oats is usually found right under the lid of the canister of Quaker Oats.  The recipe is exactly the same except for one ingredient the original recipe calls for cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice, we think the cinnamon taste much better in the cookies, of course the raisins and nuts are optional that’s up to your taste.  If you do use raisins try softening them before you put them in the cookies it keep the texture more moist, I like to make mine a little bigger and don’t over bake them, keep them nice and soft.  I always use butter never margarine but that’s also your personal taste.

I made this cookies a few times and the family members just loved it. But I replaced the pumpkin spice with cinnamon as I find it taste better. 
We prefer the cookies to be crunchy than chewy
so I bake it for an extra 10 min. Is pefect.

These are BY FAR THE BEST oatmeal cookies that I have EVER eaten!  Use the pumpkin pie spice--it's what makes the cookies special!!!!

These are really the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. Instead of just all-purpose flour, I used 1/2 c. all-purpose flour 3/4 c. whole wheat flour. 1/4 c. mixture of oat bran, wheat bran and wheat germ. I also substituted cinnamon for the pumpkin spice. Additionally, I used dark chocolate chips and chopped mixed nuts. SOOOOOO yummy. Next time I might substitute apple sauce for half the butter, to make it a little more healthy.

This is almost the exact same recipe as Quaker oats vanishing oatmeal cookies. I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter, skipped the walnuts and used apple pie spice instead of pumpkin pie spice. These cookies are so tasty and soft it really is hard to stop eating them! One more thing I do not grind up the raisins I don't think that is necessary. If you love oatmeal cookies you will love these.

I have made these as a staple for my family and to bring to work. I changed the recipe by using butter, 3/4 cup white sugar, I vary the raisins with dried blueberries, golden raisins, cranberries and dried fruit whirled in the food processor with a bit of sugar will work wonderfully. I never have black walnuts and I've substituted pine nuts, almonds, pecans whatever I happen to have on hand. I almost triple the spice, I use nutmeg, cinnamon, a touch of ground cloves and/or ginger they are fabulous. FANTASTIC I must make them once a week.

These cookies are so easy to make and taste delicious!! I, like some other bakers choose to use cinnimon instead of pumpkin spice too. I've made them with chocolate chips and another batch with raisins, equally good. Thanks for the recipe, it is now my standby.

I found this to be a very simply recipe which baked into nicely rounded cookies.  My husband felt the pumpkin pie spice was too strong.  I should note that I used chocolate pieces rather than raisins.  I don't know if that change had an effect.  Were I to make these again, I'd probably use the raisins.

Recipe always turns out well despite my very modest skills in the kitchen.  I substitute ingredients as necessity dictates or preferences change for my kids.

Made the recipe three times so far.  Followed recipe exactly the first time.  Superb cookies.  The second time I left out raisins.  The second time, I used cinnamon versus the pie spice... and the third I put in chocolate chips versus raisins and used chopped walnuts versus the black walnut.  Excellent cookies.  I love a recipe that tolerates variations and consistently produces rapidly-eaten cookies.

I was looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe to use trail mix in, and this adapted excellently!  I used cinnamon instead of the pumpkin pie spice, a personal preference, and added 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped trail mix instead of the raisins and walnuts.  They came out terrific!  If you decide to try my adaptation, I recommend separating the M & Ms and raisins out before chopping and adding them whole.  If you want more chocolate, substitute 1/2 cup chocolate chips for 1/2 cup trail mix.

This is a fabulous recipe -and as another reviewer stated, it's the same as the recipe under the Quaker Oats lid. I use the recipe as a base, and make some changes for a really good and tasty treat. *Instead of rasins, I use a cup of Craisins - the tart and sweetness really adds to the flavor.  *Instead of walnuts I use a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Delicious!  *And rather than pumpkin pie spice, I use a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of nutmeg. Nutmeg makes everything taste delicious, in my humble opinion.  *I also highly recommend using real salted cream butter and cutting the salt down to a 1/4 tsp.   WE LOVE THESE COOKIES!

excellent recipe! I have several friends who claim to not like oatmeal cookies, and they were practically inhaling these. I used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice and I left out the raisins and walnuts. They came out chewy, soft, and delicious!

This Christmas season I put nuts in almost everything I baked so I decided not to add them to these oatmeal cookies.  Instead I used one cup of raisins and one cup of dried cranberries.  I soaked them separately in hot water while I mixed up the rest of the ingeredients.  The only other change I made was to use cinnamon rather than pumpkin pie spice but only because I'd also made pumpkin pie and pumpkin bread.   They were great and they looked more "Christmas-y" than regular oatmeal cookies.

These were nice and chewy just how we like them! We left out nuts and raisins and just had them plain! Plus I subbed cinnamon for pp spice, since I didn't have it. I missed that this made 4 dozen (thought it was the 24) , so we have lots of cookies!

What a perfect oatmeal cookie!  It taste just like I remember my mother making.  It turned out perfect.  It wasn't flat or too puffy.  The onlly thing I did was omit the nuts because I didn't have any, and used cinnamon instead of pumpkin spice.  Great recipe!

These are ok... Not as moist as I would have hoped for-even making larger cookies and undercooking them. I did use the pumpkin pie spice-but only half and wasn't impressed with the flavor. I made mine into large balls which made for a nice cookie. I think 3 cups of oats are too many if you are adding anything extra-nuts,raisins etc.Mine seem over-run with oats and need more cookie... If that makes sense! I think 3 cups should be the total amount of these things combined in order to have a nice balance cookie and ingredients

Amazing!  So moist!  It lost a star as the cook time should be longer than stated as my first batch I followed the recipe time and they weren't cooked fully in the middle.  I substituted the walnuts and raisions for white chocolate chips and crandberries.  This one is definately getting saved as they were still moist and chewy the day after I made them.

A tad on the sweet side. I will def modify to use only 1/2 cup each of the sugars.  All in all very moist easy to work with cookie.  I ended up getting my hands in to mix the batter up, because I didn't want to kill my arms mixing it up with a spoon.  Plus, this prevented my cookies from being over mixed.

I we speak i am eating one of these cookies, the recipie was pretty easy to make, i didn't use my mixer becasue I didnt want my cookies to be flat. They are pretty good, and came out of the oven great with out crumbling apart, yet there just seems like something is missing. Ill figure it out and add it to the rest of the batch.

I agree with Diane Lynne, the original recipe calls for Cinnamon rather than pumpkin pie spice, although it does give it a different kick.   Also- my family prefers golden raisins and in combination I add about a cup of Craisins (dried cranberries) or dried apricots cut into small pieces.  They love this combination and it really becomes a good healthy breakfast cookie for kids on the run in the morning.  My husband takes them to work and they are the first ones to be gone with requests for more.  Thanks for posting!

Love this recipe. I make just as listed on recipe but add a handful of raisins (straight out of package) and a handful of walnuts. They are always a hit and definitely vanish.

I added extra eggs because it was so dry.  I also substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.  I was too lazy to scoop into cookies, so I just spread it out over a 13x9 pan and baked for about 37 minutes. It’s really wonderful!

Super tasty, soft and the pumpkin spice gives it such great flavor. I also added some shredded coconut. I’d definitely make these cookies again.

They were good and easy to make.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice and I couldn't find mine, so I used all spice instead.  Every one here  liked them.  Thank you.

Love this recipe! These cookies are the perfect Oatmeal cookie, not too sweet, great texture, and have a simple taste of home baked goodness. I did not dress them up with nuts or dried fruits. I made them plain & they baked up as "good old fashioned oatmeal cookies", which is exactly as I was looking for. I would never have tried pumpkin pie spice in them but that is a nice treat on flavor. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Definitely a keeper for me!

These are really good! I reduced the brown sugar a bit & soaked the raisins in hot water. I did not grind them.

I used real butter instead of margarine, and pecans instead of walnuts.  I didn't have any store bought pumpkin pie spice so I made my own from a recipe on the Internet.  These were the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted!  I almost didn't grind the raisins but decided to try it since that is what the recipe called for. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that doing that added to the sweetness and moistness of the cookie. I will use this recipe again for sure. Yummy!

This is just like the original recipe before they make it "healthy". These cookies are so good, with or with out added ingredients like raisins or nuts. Everyone loves them.

A family favorite, I used cinnamon instead of the pumpkin. These cookies vanish in one day in my house.

I see this recipe is the same recipe as on the Quaker Oats container I have been making for years, with the exception of adding walnuts (which I have always done) and the teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice rather than the ground cinnamon from the original recipe. Even the name on the Quaker Oats box is called Vanishing Oatmeal Cookies. I also add chocolate chips (and still keep the raisins) to the recipe once in awhile. But, it's great to share a good recipe!

Very flavorful, chewy cookie.  I followed the recipe as given.  I had difficulty chopping up those little raisins because my chopper's blade would get gooped up with raisins and would not chop them.  This took effort, but worth it in taste to me, because I am not crazy about raisins. I will definitely use this recipie
