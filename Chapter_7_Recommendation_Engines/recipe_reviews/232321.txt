First off, this recipe is missing a critical component.  Oven temperature.  I decided to bake at 325 degrees F.  I'm not sure if that's what the author intended.  In retrospect, that may have been too high of an oven for the amount of time this entire dish is supposed to bake.  Next time, if I left the temp as I did, I would not cook the broccoli first and only slightly brown the chicken, before adding it to the baking dish.  The broccoli was mushy, which I don't care for veggies cooked this well.  But overall, the recipe was easy and tasty and I really think it has a lot of potential.

This is a classic Chicken Divan. I made a few changes. No sherry, used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chic. Used tenderloins and cut them up into bit sized pieces. I also added 1/2 cup of pecorino romano to the chic soup mix.  Instead of rice, I used pasta that I cooked in chic broth. Really delicious!

I used fresh steamed broccoli in place of frozen and I also added a teaspoon of curry powder. I came out very good.  My husband really liked it and it seemed to taste even better warmed up the next day as leftovers.

I made a LOT of changes.  First, I made a gluten free version of this by using a substitute for the cream of chicken soup and using gluten free bread crumbs.  I also used leftover rice on the bottom, then layered the broccoli and 3 cups of leftover cooked chicken.  I spread the shredded cheese over the chicken before I poured the sauce over  and substituted parmesan in the crumb mixture instead of the cheddar.  Turned out great!  Kids loved it!

I have used other Chicken Divan recipes in the past that had more sauce, so I was concerned about the ratio of sauce to content.  I used fresh steam broccoli and discovered I had no bread crumbs.  I crushed white cheddar cheese crackers as a substitute and the results were spectacular.  My husband who dislikes chicken with sauces absolutely loved this meal and so did I.  Buttery, tasty, easy to make...What's not to like?

Quick & Easy Chicken Divan Haiku: "I baked with the rice, so all the flavors would meld. Classic comfort dish." We thought this was good, not earth-shatteringly-so, but we ate it. My husband on the other hand, ate 3 full plates of it, declaring it tummy-rubbing-comfort-goodness. My only change was baking it w/ my rice already pre-cooked as a layer in the casserole dish. (Put it all together ahead of time so that I could pull it out of the oven and serve w/o minimal effort.) To make it 4 or 5 stars, I would add curry, lemon juice and sauteed onions, and decrease the bread crumbs a bit.

This was a great recipe. I changed it up slightly but pretty much the same. I added 2 lbs of chicken tenders instead of canned and the finely chopped onion. I added sea salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I used 2 10 oz bags of broccoli.  I also used 2 3/4 of a cup of rice instead of 2. Just added 3/4 of a cup of water extra. I also added more of the block cheese, about 2 oz extra. I added the milk butter and block cheese to the chicken in the pan so that they could mix with the chicken juices. I mixed the soups together in the casserole dish and added the warm mixture of the cheesy chicken. Added the rice then the broccoli and some panko bread crumbs tossed with melted butter. (About 2 Tbs Butter to 1 cup of crumbs. I baked that bad boy for 30 minutes and it was perfect.

This was so good, I made it very close to the original recipe, but used mushroom soup, added Mrs. Dash Garlic herb blend and lemon pepper instead of lemon juice. And put in an extra dash of sherry. I want to try it with your exact recipe sometime, but it was an excellent base to use  substitutions.  The sauce was so rich and creamy,  I loved it! And the big test was my family, they would eat it again.  Thank you!

It was OK, not great, but OK.  First, there is no temperature listed so I used 350F.  I followed the recipe.  The sauce was tasty enough but there was such a little bit that I could barely taste it on the chicken and broccoli.  I had to scrape sauce together from the baking dish to taste it.  Also, the sauce needed salt.  The chicken and broccoli also needed salt and maybe pepper.  I would make it again, but I would make 50% more sauce and salt everything.

this is a great chicken casserole.  i doubled the bread cream and butter so it covered the entire top of casserole mixture.  Also, i do not keep cooking sherry so i google and substituted 1/2 tablespoon cider vinegar and 1/2 teas vanilla flavoring.  Awesome!

The only major change I made was to only use 1/2 cup of (light) mayo, and sub in 1/2 cup of fat free greek yogurt. (too many points on WeightWatchers)

The other changes I made were to use fresh ingredients where I could.  I used fresh broccoli, leftover roast chicken,   and made my own cream of mushroom soup. (I prefer cream of mushroom) Oh yeah, I also used a Tablespoon of coconut oil instead of 3 Tablespoons of butter.
 
This came out awesome!   It's great comfort food, and by changing up or adding spices you can easily change the flavor profile. The broccoli went in raw, and came out with a nice crunch, which is how I prefer broccoli. 

I thought the serving size was a little large.  1/6 of this over some brown rice was a big bowlful, but I toughed it out and ate it all.

I would totally make this again, but I liked my changes.

This recipe was exactly what I needed. Quick, easy and good. I substituted red wine for the Sherry.
