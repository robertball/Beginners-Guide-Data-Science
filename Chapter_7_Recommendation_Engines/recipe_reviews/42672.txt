This is just the recipe I was looking for! I was able to get the baker's amonia at a local pharmacy, but you can also get it from the King Arthur Baking Company.  

My dough was too sticky for rolling into balls so I used two soup spoons and dropped the dough onto the cookie sheet - then used the glass dipped in sugar to flatten.  I had substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco instead of lard...the butter probably caused the stickiness.  

I also made a light lemon frosting and my family LOVES THEM!  Next time I will try all crisco and see if they are less sticky.  You could easily cut this recipe in half and still have plenty of cookies.

These are a true lemon cookie.  The baking amonia is an ingredient missing in modern recipes.   Get some and use it in other recipes... it makes a great flavor and texture.   My grandmother made these and my Dad (now 90) has been hungry for them for many years..   Merry Christmas to him (and to all of us who got some).  He hides them so no one will get his "good" cookies.   I assure him he will get more - we all love them!! Worth the effort of getting the baking amonia.

These were soooo good.  The consistency of mine were perfect (I used Crisco).  They rolled into balls easily.  Maybe my eggs were a little smaller than the previous reviewer.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

This is a nice cookie. I used orange since I didn't have lemon and crisco. I made half of the batch with ground up walnuts I wanted to use up. I liked the ones with the walnuts best I think., but they were both tasty

Tried to find someone in my family who had a copy of a recipe a great aunt used to make when I was a kid.  No one could find it so I found this on allrecipes.  This isn't exactly the same but it was pretty good!  I have tweaked it and suggest using some grated lemon rind in it for more flavour.

I used Crisco, and half Fiori di Sicilia, half almond extract for the flavor.  The dough was very sticky so I couldn't flatten them, and the result was a cookie that is a little firm around the edges but very cakey in the middle.

I used 1/2 t of Fiori di Sicilia, and 1/2 t of almond. The flavor is awesome! But the smell of ammonia is lingering - I wonder if the amount is supposed to be in teaspoons rather than tablespoons. That seemed like a lot. Or maybe I didn't bake them quite long enough.

I put most of the batter in the fridge, so maybe after they ripen a little they'll be easier to scoop and flatten and I'll try cooking them a little longer to hopefully get the crisper texture I thought I was going to get with these.

In any case, a good recipe, but it didn't give me as much guidance as I'd hoped. I think I can make something really delicious with it, though, so thank you!

I am not sure whether I like it or not yet. I ate 3 cookies hoping to discover whether I liked them or not. I definitely think they taste OK. But I'm not sure if I'd make them okay without tweaks. 

I've worked with bakers ammonia and I know it has a strong flavor and smell.

The dough came out too sticky to work with. So, I ended up adding another cup of flour.

There is a lot of sugar, but oddly enough, the cookie isn't really sweet tasting. 

The lemon flavor doesn't hit you until after you swallow the cookie. I'm not sure why, but it's more of an after taste.

In terms of texture, this is why I love bakers ammonia. It makes cookies light and fluffy.

I might consider trying it with a nuttier extract, like almond. Or try a different method for the lemon flavor. I made these with a huge lemon cookie craving.

Great cookie!  Well worth buying lemon oil and bakers ammonia.  I chilled the dough overnight and used a small ice cream scoop to measure dough.
