Very good cookie for a quick cake mix cookie.  I could not find an orange cake mix, so I made my own. I had a yellow cake mix and I added 1 tsp. orange extract and 1/4 c. orange juice and zested half of a large orange in to the cake mix.  Worked perfectly.  In my picture, the cookies on the left we baked after just dropping them on the cookie sheet.  The cookies on the right (my preferred way) were how they baked up if I smashed them just a little prior to baking.  Nice cookie that you could taste both the orange and the cranberries.  I would make these again.

I love this recipe.  I used a chocolate cake and milk chocolate chips and made the best double chocolate chip cookies I have ever put in my mouth.  Can't wait to experiment with different cake mixes.  Next is yellow cake and semi-sweet chocolate chips for chocolate chip cookies.  I may even try a german chocolate version.

A great, easy recipe for delicious softer cookies. I added 3/4 c unsweetened flaked coconut, 1 tsp coconut extract, 1/2 c dried cranberries and 1/2 c dark chocolate chips.

Really good and different cookies.  Super easy to make.  Only makes 2 dozen + 3 cookies, so be forewarned.  I baked for 10 minutes, cooled for 5 on baking sheet, then transferred to wax paper.  Cools quickly on waxed paper.  Cookies will look done once cooled.  Very soft and good cookie.

Just scaled back the oil a little since I was only able to get a 15.25oz cake mix.

These cookies are very good, they do taste a little like cake mix but still delicious. I will definitely make them again. I could not find orange cake mix so I used yellow cake mix and added 1 orange, I zested the one orange and squeezed all the juices in the mix. Cookies came out great.

I used yellow cake with orange extract and I always rehydrate dried fruit with juice and/or wine or brandy a day

Tasty and simple, however no one confused me for a gourmet chef :)  My cookies flattened a bit more than the photos.  A tasty, simple treat.
