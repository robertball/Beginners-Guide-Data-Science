Great recipe.  I followed it exactly for the filling.  I then put 1/2 cup salsa (store bought) in bottom of baking dish.  Using flour tortillas, I rolled the filling with just a smidgen of cheese in each.  Then I poured more salsa on top and baked for 30-40 minutes.  Great for left over Thanksgiving turkey!

This recipe really turned out great.  We used our leftover turkey from Christmas dinner to make tasty tacos and burritos for a post-Christmas/pre-New Years Fiesta.  Combine it in a soft tortilla with cheese, sour cream, avocado, and lime juice and you've got a delicious meal.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Great basic recipe.  I found the fresh tomato to be a great addition to the flavor.  I took the advice of a couple of the other reviewers and added some spice to it.  I suggest adding 2 teaspooons of Cumin and 2 teaspoons of Ancho Chile Pepper.  It will not be hot, but it will be high in flavor.

Very good. I threw in a bit of finely chopped carrot, and used real garlic instead of garlic powder. Also added some cumin and a bit of taco seasoning. Served with flour tortillas, cheese and sour cream.

A great recipe for leftover turkey. The only thing missing here was some heat so I added some dice jalapeno that brought it up to a five star recipe.

This was an okay recipe for turkey left-overs.  I added broiled red bell pepper slices which enhanced the recipe a bit.  Thanx for the recipe.

This is a great idea for using the leftover turkey.  However, Itotally modified it.  This gave me a great base but I did not have the ingred.  I used dehydrated onions, 2 cups diced tomatoes, and used the seasonings that my family likes.  I also used salsa while cooking it.  We then made burritos out of them.

This was a really nice way to use some leftover turkey. We added a little cumin and taco seasoning for added flavor. Next time I think I would add more tomato and let it simmer down.

Delicious! I added diced tomatos in the can in addition to fresh tomatos and it was great. We made tacos and my husband loved them. Will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe was a little bland but has potential with additional seasoning.
