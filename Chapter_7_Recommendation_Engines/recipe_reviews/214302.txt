Delish! I used all light products and it still felt very full flavored to me. I had everything on hand but the crust which I bought pre-made. Otherwise I used reduced fat cream cheese, peanut butter, cool whip and sugar substitute. It eliminated about 150 calories per serving. I had to try it after about an hour (couldn't wait four hours!) and I loved it. I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow!

If you are a peanut butter and chocolate, then you will love this pie.  I didn't have any cool whip, but did have a package of dream whip, so I used that.  I made my crust with my own oreo crumbs and butter that I pre-baked for about 8 minutes before putting the filling in, and used a 9 inch springform pan for easier serving.  Was enjoyed by all and is very easy to make.  If you already have the crust, this pie can be made in minutes.

This pie is delicious. My bf couldnt wait to steal a piece. He took one as soon as it was done, didn't even let it sit. Very simple to make.

Love this recipe.  I could not find the oreo crust pie shells  so I made my own pie crust.  I used 20 oreo cookies, crushed finely, makes about 2-1/4 cups, mixed with 3 Tbs. of butter. I then pressed the mixture into the bottom of a 6oz. pie pan.  Quick, easy and delicious!

I have made this pie before many times.  It is so easy and delish!  I too have used light cream cheese, and 1/2 the fat crust.  I also used 2 sliced bananas to the bottom just before adding the filling.  I just can't get enough of it!  You will love it

This was good, rich, but good. My husband isn't much of a "cheese cake" fan and disliked that he could taste the cream cheese so distinctly. So, I think next time I make it, I'll use a bit more than 1/4 C of peanut butter. I also used Dark Chocolate Hot Fudge... delish!

This is extremely tasty, though I could only have a small portion as it was pretty rich, but oh so good. I used low fat cream cheese and lite cool whip with my own oreo crust made with reduced fat oreos. Very good and didn't have to feel as guilty eating it.

Absolutely delicious and easy to  make!  You could totally get away with using less sugar I believe.  So, so good.

Definitely a five star. It will go into my "Keeper" collection. I made one minor change. I put 1/3 cup of peanut butter rather than 1/4 cup as called for, and I think it improved the peanut butter taste immensely.

This was very easy to make.  I did find it to be very rich and a bit too sweet for me.  My family enjoyed it and that's the most important part.  I think next time I will try it with Splenda and other lite ingredients and see if it helps with the richness.

I used ganache instead of fudge topping and I beat heavy cream instead of using the cool whip (1 cup heavy cream) and it turned out great!!

This pie is SO good & so EASY to make. I made my own crust & increase amount of peanut butter & fudge topping just a little as we love peanut butter & chocolate. Used crunchy peanut butter as that is what I had & it was good.

I used all light and fat-free ingredients and still found this very rich.  A bit too thick and sweet for our taste.  I wish I would have cut back or left out the extra sugar and folded in all the cool-whip.

This was amazing! I made this for my boyfriend and he said he absolutely loved it! I ate a piece and I just couldn't believe how wonderful it was. It was the perfect dessert for all of us.

I definately loved this recipe it was first intent for a no bake pie! I only made a couple of changes. I didn't use the fudge chocolate, I used PB2 three teaspoons to be exact and I used fat free cool whip. I also used only half a cup of sugar but  I did have to use a little bit of whipping cream to get the creamy consistency. I froze for two hours and actually  kept in the freezer. It turned out awesome !!

This is a keeper!  I think I'll add a bit more pb to it next time.  I drizzled ice cream fudge AND caramel with crushed pecan topping on each slice! YUMMO!
