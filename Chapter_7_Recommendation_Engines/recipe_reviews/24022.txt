The bread was pretty good...Not a huge hit but had potential...maybe bud light wasnt the best choice of beers to use...

I have now made this several times.  I prefer NOT to blend the chilies and cheese and I like the looks of the cheese strips in the bread. Have tried several different beers and frankly can't tell the difference. Make darn sure you use Self Rising, was out once and tried regular flour for a super flop. I also add lots of toasted pecans.  Yum.

I used a can of cheap beer (it's all we had at the time and I really wanted to make beer bread) and it was amazing.  My husband and my dad loved this bread fresh from the oven, and later that night my husband's best friend came over and just about finished off the entire loaf and asked for the recipe!  I thought that using the blender was just going to be a hassle and create extra dishes to wash, but it was totally worth it.  Can't wait to make it again and again!  It was also pretty spicy.

I had good results with this bread. Note for those using canned chilies: If you use a brand that's watery mush, the flavor will be fine, but your bread will be soggy unless you compensate by decreasing the beer a bit. Mine were watery, mushy chilies, and I decreased the beer by about 2-3 ounces. I'd also suggest using extra-sharp Cheddar cheese and drizzling the top with about 2-3 tbsp. melted butter before baking. The recipe doesn't state this, but one of the most important things about making beer bread is not to overwork the batter - just stir gently until there are no dry spots remaining. Let the batter be lumpy and it'll come out great.

I make this all the time.  I use whatever beer I have on hand. I've used cold beer and warm beer.  Same to me no matter what I use.   I don't blend anything, just dump in some shredded cheese sometimes, sometimes some garlic powder.  Sometimes both sometimes neither.  Easy easy and I've never had a flop.  Always crusty on top and done in the middle.  I don't know why the one had hers come out mushy.

Loved this! I used a 7oz can of green chilies that I drained. I didn't blend the chilies & cheese (not sure why you would need to do that). Cooked up perfectly in 1 hr & I can't quit eating it.

I cut the recipe and half and since I still ran out of self-rising flour, I substituted about 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and a dash of baking powder for the remainder.  It still came out very well - My family ate the whole loaf in one meal.

My bread was also mushy in the middle but I believe it's because my green chiles were too watery.  The bread tasted fantastic though so I will make again.  Next time I will use 2 cans of whole green chiles, drained and patted dry, then diced.

This recipe was nearly effortless and turned out perfectly.  I used the AR formula for "self-rising flour", and made 1 of the 3 cups whole wheat flour.  Also didn't puree the cheese & chiles, just shredded and chopped finely.  Will definitely make again!

I am honestly not sure about this - it was easy to make and didn't taste BAD, I just wasn't wowed and neither was my husband who loves chiles. I'll keep the recipe around, and perhaps try the idea of chopping my own chiles instead of using canned. So jury is still out on this recipe.

I used a dark brown ale with this, and only half the chili peppers it called for, as I don't like my food too spicy. It turned out pretty well and smelled wonderful while baking.

Did not blend cheese or chiles.  Used Guinness Stout.  Smells great and has a good flavor, but too strong for me.   May need to use a lighter beer.

I don't know about this.  I can't give it a 4 because I really didn't like it.  But I don't want to give it a real low rating either.  I don't like beer, so I don't know if it had anything to do with it.  I had some IPA left over from a visiting friend.

Was too much a beer taste/smell.  Can barely taste anything else.  Not sure if I would make this again.

I had better results than some here... I used a home brewed beer (a medium ale), did a heaping cup of sharp cheddar and one can of green chiles (drained). The bread was heavier than I expected, but delivered decent flavour, but the hint of ale  really made it special.

This was a VERY good quick bread. Thanks to Scottdog for reviewing it on the forum & posting such a yummy pic on AR! I admit that it was pretty wet & the two smaller loaves that I made had to be turned over so the bottoms wouldn’t overbrown & the middles could finish cooking. You can do one of two things to avoid this. Either use less beer or chop your own chiles. Pre-chopped chiles have liquid that is difficult to drain entirely. Thanks for posting this one:o)

Though I read the "mushy" reviews, I decided to try this recipe anyway because it sounded tasty. WRONG. I had the same awful results as the other two who left a negative reviews. The bread was golden brown on the outside, but very mushy and unappealing on the inside. I've made a few breads recently and this was by far the worst. It wasn't even edible. :(.

No self rising flour so made mine with baking powder and salt. I used a good ol' Busch beer for this bread, as I've always found that the cheaper beers make the best beer bread. I also used Cracker Barrel's 2% sharp white because that's what I had on hand. With most beer breads that I make, I drizzled two tbsp. of melted butter over the top before baking. This came out nicely.

This has become my base for all beer bread variants. I still make this version regularly and it turns out nicely. The only modification I consistently make is skipping the blender (I don't mind green pepper pieces in my bread, and the cheese is well-grated to begin with). 

If I know we're going to be finishing the bread within 24 hours, I leave it in an additional 5-10 minutes to get more crispy on the outside. If I'm going to make it last over several days, I take it out at 60 minutes as instructed and the additional moisture helps it get less stale.

Note: If I am using canned chilies, I drain them before adding them to the batter. Fresh chilies aren't as wet.

I came across this recipe and really wanted to make it that day. I however did not have cheddar nor green chilies.  I subbed mozzarella for the cheddar and diced pepperochini for the chilies and added some garlic basil and oregano. I essentially made this Italian beer bread. Baked for an hour at 350. Came out perfect. Crunchy on the outside moist on the inside. Will definitely make again

It was ok but I did find it bland. Not what I was expecting, I guess I was thinking it would be full of flavor but it wasn't.

I love this receipe, I used whole can chillies and cooked them on the stove top to just get out some of the moisture and my bread wasn't mushy at all. I also used a Samuel Adams Octobefest beer. I will definatly make this one again!!

This didn't work out too well for me. I am not the greatest baker, so that's my fault. But I found this to be a little too bland for my liking. I used "salami cheese" from Mouse Haus in Wisconsin, and my own fresh cayenne peppers, finely diced (I used 5 good sized ones). I'm not sure where I went wrong. I might try this again sometime, though. I like the idea of beer, cheese, and chili peppers.
