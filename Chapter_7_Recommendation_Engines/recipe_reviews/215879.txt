I used chicken instead of pork, served over vegetable spaghetti. I think the Classico Tomato and Basil is the healthiest of the Classico line. Many of them have vegetable oil instead of olive oil.

Soooo yummy!!  Followed this recipe exactly except I did only use one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and it was plenty of sauce.  Browned the chops well so they didn't fall apart but you didn't need a knife at all.  Definitely a keeper--and so easy!

I made this but with a few substitutions...I did not use a slow cooker. I instead browned the meat in a dutch oven over the stove, added all the other ingredients, brought it to a boil and then let it simmer on the stove for almost 3 hours. Came out VERY tender. I used two pounds of cubed pork instead of pork chops. I also used 1 1/2 cups of white wine, Parmesan cheese, chopped bacon and tossed in a bay leaf instead of the dried basil & Italian seasoning. I also substituted Hunt's Original tomato sauce, but I also have a jar of the Classico Tomato sauce that I plan on using next time. I browned the pork in olive oil and the bacon fat. It came out really delicious and everyone loved it. Definitely not for calorie-counting, but who cares? Once in a while, you have to splurge, right! Mmm!

This was a very flavorful recipe and an overall good meal.  However, I was not crazy about the texture of pork chops in the slow cooker.  Next time I will probably try the recipe with a pork roast instead.

This was FABULOUS!!! My entire family gobbled it up (even the picky ones) and then fought over the small amount of leftovers the next day. I used Southern style pork spareribs and they were really good. I like using pork with the bones in the crock pot, it does enhance the flavor. I did not use the mozzarella cheese, not necessary.
