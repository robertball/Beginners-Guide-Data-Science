A coworker brought these in and they were delicious! This seemed so odd but they are so yummy. Sweet, crunchy and salty...awesome! Next time I will use more pecans and a bit more salt to cut the sweetness. Thanks don!

So I baked 3 pies for Thanksgiving and at the last minute decided to make this. Needless to say this was a hugehit and was the only thing that we ran out of! Definitely double the pecans but everything else is perfect. thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit! Very easy, too. On the advice of a previous reviewer, I doubled the pecans. I also melted some milk chocolate and drizzled it over half of them. The chocolate drizzle didn't add as much as I thought it would; these are wonderful as is!

Very good recipe. I would recommend using a smaller pan or a larger amount of the pecan/sugar mixture, as the bars were a little thin. Will definitely become a Thanksgiving favorite! The picture I used is sideways for some reason.

Easy recipe and very very good!  I saw the same recipe on another site that had a tip to add dark chocolate chips to the top immediately after you take out of the oven then add the salt.  OMG - YUMMY!!

Great recipe, so very easy!! I used sea salt (not ground) would add more salt next time. Very addictive, these did not last very long.

This recipe is the same as the one on the Southern Living website.  The end result is awesome - totally a keeper.  I have to double the caramel/pecan mixture to get enough to cover the crackers, though.   I also sprinkle the bars with semi-sweet chocolate chips after they come out of the oven and spread that around after a few minutes.  Great - thanks for putting this on here.

I love pecan pie--the crust.... the pecan topping....everything that is except the filling.  Like many reviewers, I doubled the pecans but didn't change anything else, but next time (like tomorrow!), I'll add more salt and I'm not a salt person. Delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Made these for an ornament party.  Big hit!!  As suggested, I doubled the pecans.  Next time I will chop them a little smaller...I think that will help in the spreading of the mixture.  So Good!

I did not have cream so I used half and half. I also used twice the pecans which is a must. TO check toffees readiness, put a bit in ice water, if  its hard,  its ready

UPDATE:  I took these to work and everyone jokingly said that this should be called, 'crack'.  This went like hotcakes and everyone agreed these are so addicting and so good. this is very good, and one would want to break into smaller pieces, as this is very sweet and rich.  Butter toffee like flavor.  I added 1/2 cup extra of the nuts and it was perfect.  I had to end up moving my grahams to a larger cookie sheet, as all 12 would not fit in the jelly roll pan.  Don't worry if all the syrup does not spread entirely onto all the crackers, as it will spread out and fill in when you bake it.  Don't forget that little 1/4 tsp Kosher salt, as it really adds something to it; like a sea salt caramel vibe.  Easy to make and a nice change for holiday treats.

I can't stop eating them. And when I'm not eating them, I'm thinking about eating them.
I doubled the pecans as recommended by others.

These were so good and addicting.  However, mine were not crisp, but very soft.   What went wrong?  I thought I followed directions to the letter.

This was a last minute "clean out the cupboard" kinda recipe and I was a skeptic, so much sweet!  I put the pan on the counter to cool, came back 1/2 hour later to a half empty pan!  Way too addicting and way better than I expected. It's a rich recipe and obviously not too friendly on the hips but who cares!!?  Yummy.

These are great!  I used 2 cups pecans.  Spread the nuts on the crackers and poured the caramel on top.
Next time I will chop the nuts instead of using halves.
