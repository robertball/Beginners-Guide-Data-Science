This is a great base recipe.  I put the feta and cream cheese in a food processor and added fresh spinach, roasted red peppers, garlic, and basil to make a filling with which to stuff the chicken.  To the pan, I added about 3 T of extra virgin olive oil and 3 T of lemon juice. I wilted some fresh spinach, added some feta and mixed it with a lemon rice and it was great.  My dinner party guests raved over it and couldn't get enough of the "lemon sauce" for the chicken.  If you are experienced with roux, you could thicken the lemon-chicken stock after cooking and that would be great, too.

I made this for a dinner party.  I used toothpicks instead of kitchen string.  I also dipped the chicken in melted butter and then rolled in a 2:1 ratio of seasoned bread crumbs and parm cheese.  Came out delicious!

We loved this recipe! I placed chicken between pieces of waxed paper and pounded it thin then added the cheese mixture (as listed in recipe). The only change I made was, after brushing the rolled chicken with melted butter, to sprinkle each piece with a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesian cheese. The little bit of cheese that oozed out during cooking time was excellent spooned on top of the chicken. I served this alongside gnocchi with browned sage butter sauce. Too good!

I thought this was excellent. The only thing I did differently was cut a pocket into the chicken, and used fresh garlic instead of powder. I also omitted the butter completly and drizzled lemon juice over the whole thing. Really good, thank you!

YUM-MY!!!! We all loved this dish! To the stuffing I added about 1 Tablespoon of Pesto-instead of the dill and 1-2 teaspoons fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder a few shakes of red pepper flakes into the mix. I seasoned the chicken really well (I did what a lot of people have done and just made a "pocket" for the stuffing.) I put sliced mushrooms on top of the chicken, 1/2 lemon juiced over everything, poured some extra virgin olive oil over the top seasoned and popped in the oven for about 40 minutes. This was AWESOME over Linguini I poured the sauce that was in the bottom of my chicken dish over the pasta-PERFECT!!!

This was SO good. I have found a new favorite fancy dish. I did alter it a little, based on the other reviews. I added some finely diced red onion, some chopped kalamata olives, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. I added more cheese too, to create a sauce type effect to put over orzo pasta that I seasoned with garlic and pepper and lemon. Thanks for a great recipe - Delicious!

This chicken is very Good!  I added minced garlic and a little fresh squeezed lemon juice to the stuffing mix.  I topped the breast pieces with lemon pepper instead of just plain salt and pepper.  I was short on time so I just sliced the breasts open down the side to make a pocket and closed it with toothpicks.  I increased the baking time to ~40 minutes to factor in the thicker pieces of chicken.  We will definitely make this again and again!

What a wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe pretty close but did add some finely chopped calamata olives to the mix. After I basted the chicken with the butter I dusted the top with coarsely crushed salad croutons. As this was going to a large group, I cut each breast on a bias into 5 pieces  and plated on a bed of lettuce. Looked great and tasted even better! I'm getting into this cooking thing!!

I love this recipe. I make it at all the time served over lightly salted jasmine rice. I always use real minced garlic instead of garlic powder just because I love garlic. I even had some of the cheese spill over onto sweet white corn and it was awesome. Just for easy clean up, line a dish with foil before baking. Then just toss the foil when you're done. If there were more than 5 stars I'd give this recipe more.

Fantastic!!  OMG, this dissapeared, it was so good!  I altered it so slightly, I used 4 chicken tenders, pounded thin, I replaced dill with Oregano, Basil and Chives, about 1/2 to 3/4t each.  I replaced garlic powder with 2 fresh cloves of garlic, minced. I replaced whole cream cheese with 1/3 less fat.  Everything else was the same.  Except in my oven at 350 for 20 minutes, then 400 for 5 more minutes.  This was so amazing, creamy, flavorful, yum!  I served with roasted red potatoes and fresh roasted green beans.  So amazing.  I have never ever tasted chicken this amazing before. Please post more easy recipes like this.   This one was so perfect!  Its a gourmet dish that takes 5 minutes to prepare and on the table in 30 minutes from start to finish with little cleanup!  I baked 4 tenderloins wrapped in cheese fill in my glass 8x8 pan, each piece individually wrapped in twine, cutting off excess!  Make this, you wont be disappointed!  Thank you so much for posting this!

This is a real "keeper" recipe!  I added more dillweed and used 1/2 teaspoon freshly minced garlic, instead of the garlic powder. I found that I would really have preferred only 1/4 teaspoon.  Just my personal choice.  I made enough for "planned-overs" and was so glad I did!

I used Italian seasoning instead of dill weed, and rolled the chicken in bread crumbs as other reviewers recommended. Also, I have a ton of roasted peppers to use up, so I blended that into the creamcheese mixture. Delish!

WOW this is scary good!   I doubled the cheese recipe and used the extra to surround the breasts while baking.   This allowed me extra for the fettucini topping.    I also added some pepper and onions to the cheese mixture.    For breading, I followed other suggestions and combined croutons and parmessean cheese.    This was 5-star restaraunt good and would have been excellent just as is without my add-ons, but I have to be me.

This was great. I followed some of the suggestions and made a tapenade with feta cheese,olive oil, lemon juice and kalamata olives as well to top the chicken.  My family enjoyed, will definitely make again.

Way too much dill.  I will only try this again with an altered recipe significantly reducing the dill or using oregano in it's place.

We rolled the stuffed chicken breasts in panko crumbs before cooking and served on brown rice.  Needed to cook a little longer than 20 minutes (about 30 minutes)and was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very flavorful!  I added a pinch of grated parmesan and reduced the dill weed to 1 1/2 tsp.  I also didn't have cooking string, so I used the mixture as a topping, and baked the chicken unrolled.  It turned out great!  I will make this again!

This was fantastic! I keep getting requests to make this for dinner it was so delicious! I did make a couple changes. I used diced roasted garlic instead of powdered. It was kept from being too strong by the cream cheese and feta combo. I also wrapped the chicken in bacon. This made it so I had to cook it for longer but it was so worth it!!

My husband & I both thought the dill overpowered the cheese mixture.  I would definitly suggest cutting back on the dill.  Other than that, I found the recipe pretty easy to make.  I like recipes with not too many ingredients or steps.  Keeping it simple for my busy life!

My husband & I just made this & loved it! Based on other reviews we added chopped scallions, a few chopped black olives & fresh garlic, salt & pepper to the cream cheese mix. And we cut pockets in the ckn., stuffed, secured w/ toothpicks, then dipped in melted butter & breaded in 1/2 ital. crumbs & 1/2 parm. cheese. Then added 4 T lemon juice/4T ol. oil to the baking dish. The ckn browned & the sauce was wonderful over lemon rice. We had salad & dill steamed carrots & a great night - thanks!

My family loves this recipe.  I've changed it a bit to fit our tastes.  I don't use dill weed (we don't like it) and add sliced sun-dried tomatoes to the cream cheese mixture.  Sometimes I wrap each breast with proscuitto.  Bake for about 25-30 minutes.  Delish!  One time I didn't have cream cheese and used mayonnaise-that worked great.  This receipe can be varied to fit your family!

This was pretty good but took much, much longer than 20 minutes to cook.  I had to keep taking out of the oven and checking the chicken.  I'd say total cooking time was close to an hour.  The chicken breasts I used weren't all that thick either and I even pounded them between two pieces of wax paper like other reviewers suggested.  The flavor (when it was finally done) was very good though.

This was delicious!  I added some seasoned bread crumbs before I baked it in the oven, which really added to the flavor of the dish.  You could really substitute any herd (dried or fresh) in place of the dill weed.  I have tried it with basil and chives.

BEST RECIPE EVER!! i did tweak it up big- seasoning my chicken w/salt and pepper first. then i used cream cheese, feta cheese, garlic powder, 1/4 cup shredded mozzerella cheese & 1 tablespoon steamed/drained spinach. i spread the filling and then rolled each chicken breast up using toothpicks to secure. dipped in melted butter and coated with mix 1/2season breadcrumbs 1/2 parm cheese. baked @ 350 degrees for 40 min. or until golden. so juicy & delicious and pretty easy! will make again for sure!!

Very good, be sure to pound your chicken very thin or your rolls will be to fat to cook evenly.

I give this 3 1/2 stars.  Not terrible, by any means, but I just wasn't big on the combination of cream cheese and feta.  I love both, and I really thought it sounded awesome, gooey and cheesy.  It just wasn't.  I still liked it enough to eat leftovers the next day, but I probably won't make it again.

The first time I made it, the chicken was too thick and didn't cook all the way. It was a bummer to put it back into the oven, but a mistake I will not repeat again! It's delicious and I always get great reviews :)

Excellent! I added some frozen spinach to the filling and loved it. Used Lemon pepper, and salt for the topping. Used lemon/butter/olive oil mix for the sauce in the dish. It was great! :-)

This was really good chicken, but I did change they cheesy filling substantially.  I reduced both cheese (cream cheese to about 2 ounces and feta to about 1/4 cup) and I added in: garlic clove, fresh baby spinach, fire roasted red peppers.  I blitzed this all together in my mini-food processer, stuffed the chicken and baked.  The end result was very yummy - I will make again for sure.

Thought it was delicious!  I did add roasted red peppers and doubled the cream cheese.  I used big pieces of chicken and didn't pound them enough after I butterflied so it ended up taking closer to an hour.  Also the stuffing ended up coming out a lot and made more of a sauce, but was still really good.  I will use thinner pieces next time though- the mix was really very tasty. Also I'll use the string, as suggested instead of the toothpicks I used.  Thank you!

I made the recipe using the pocket method as suggested by one viewer.  It worked out great.   We made israeli couscous and baked sweet potatoes with this and everyone raved about the combination of flavors.   It's a great recipe and really like it that there weren't so many ingredients.

Loved this!! It had such a fresh, pleasing taste.  The only thing I would change is to make a pocket in the chicken breasts instead of pounding them flat. YUMMY!!

Yum yum!  I made this small scale with the dill, it was very tasty.  I made large scale (140 people) with basil instead of dill and it was SO much yummier.  I cut a little pocket in the breast to make it go faster.  I would definitely make this again!

An absolute favorite! I made a slit for the filling and just stuffed the breasts rather than rolling them, and increased the cooking time to 40ish minutes. I skipped the dill, and instead used a splash of lemon juice, two cloves of finely minced garlic and some finely minced fresh basil. It was absolutely deliciuos and there were no leftovers!

This is a fantastic recipe! The best chicken we have ever eaten!  I took some of the suggestions and added roasted red peppers, and fresh garlic to the filling. I also put some olive oil in the baking dish and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. I left out the dill and baked for 40 minutes. We absolutely loved this!!!

Excellent dish!  The feta cheese / cream cheese mixture is VERY tasty!  I made a couple of alterations: 1. rather than brushing the chicken with melted butter, I sprinkled lemon pepper spice on top of each chicken breast; 2. further, since I was using jumbo-sized chicken breasts, I baked the chicken uncovered in the oven for 40 minutes, rather than just 20 minutes to ensure the chicken was thoroughly cooked.  This recipe goes very well with the roasted chicken risotto with caramelized onion recipe from this website along with iceberg lettuce with feta cheese!

This was great!  The filling was delicious and creamy.  It went so well with the chicken.  I couldn't believe how fast it was to make!  I kept the chicken together with toothpicks and it worked well.

I can't tell you how delicious I thought these were!  Yum!!!!  So rich and flavorful.  And they were easy, but appeared as if I spent hours!  I scooped some of the stuffing that came out during cooking over the breasts before serving.

I did the chicken pocket instead of pounding it thin. I had to bake about 30 minutes. I used toothpicks instead of twine. Hubby thought it was great, I thought it was okay. The feta didn't come through, and the dill was so-so. I'd switch to minced garlic instead of powder, and maybe do something different instead of dill... tarragon? cumin and cinnamon? something.

butter keeps it soft and juicy on the outside and the stuffing keep it moist on the inside.  Flavors are bursting in this recipes and goes all well together.

This was excellent! Very tasty and the saltiness of the filling from the feta cheese went extremely well with the chicken. It took about 40 minutes to bake, though as the chicken breast halves were quite large.

Excellent. I followed the recipe as written, but (as per another reviewer) poured the juice of half a lemon over the chicken before baking. It was awesome. Next time I will brown the chicken under the broiler before serving. I found it took about 40 minutes to cook through (I followed the method of pounding and rolling the chicken around the stuffing. No need for string or toothpicks). Will definitly make again.

OMG!!!!   This was fantastic!  I took others advise and slit the chicken.  In my cream cheese and feta mixture I added pesto, sun dried tomatos, spinich and a garlic paste that I found in the fresh spices in the grocery store.  I then used seasoned bread crumbs with parmesan cheese and sprinkled that over.  I squeezed 1/2 of  a fresh lemon in the bottom of my pan and then again over the chicken before baking.  I does take more time in the oven than the recipe states.  I wanted to serve this over pasta.  So I used linguini noodles and made a sauce much like a scampi sauce but added mushrooms, bits of broccoli, more pesto sauce and garlic then squeezed the rest of my lemon in the sauce.  It was FABULOUS!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This was..... DELICIOUS. I did make a few changes based on reviews. I used pesto instead of dill weed, and I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added spinach to the stuffing. I blended the stuffing all together with my food processor. This is a great way to sneak spinach into the meal because once it's all processed you wouldn't even know it's in there (Sure, it's green, but the pesto can be blamed for that!). I also cut slits into the chicken breasts to insert the stuffing and held them closed with toothpicks.  I then brushed the chicken breasts with a butter/lemon juice mixture, and dipped them into italian breadcrumbs. I baked for 40 minutes and they were PERFECT! Oh, bake them on parchment paper - that way nothing sticks and it's easy to scoop up any filling that might ooze out while baking!  I will DEFINITELY be making this again. They also taste great re-heated. I brought leftovers in for lunch today and my coworkers were all commenting on how great it smelled after I microwaved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe. It is similar to one I used to make but much better and easier. I changed it slightly. I mixed the butter with the Feta and cream cheese. For the Feta, I used both plain and herbed Feta and added a little extra because I love it. I held it together with toothpicks because I didn't have cooking string. I sprayed the top with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled garlic and Paprika on top. When it was almost done I just broiled it slighly to crisp the skin. Everyone loved it and I will make it often! Thank you.

This was really good!  I added prosciutto and fresh garlic to the cream cheese mixture.  The chicken definitely took longer than 20 minutes, but I probably didn't pound them thin enough.

EASY AND TASTY. REPLACED THE DILL WITH SOME TARRAGON AND ITALIAN SEASON. I THINK ANY "TWEAKING" WOULD WORK WELL WITH THIS BASE.  ENDED UP COOKING THE CHICKEN 35-40 MIN.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago and had a few friends over. It got great reviews! A little too rich for my taste but everyone else loved it! I suggest adding chopped mushrooms & onion.  Gives it some good flavor. Also used garlic & herb feta.
Will definitely add this to my recipe box.
Thanks!

This was delicious.  I used garlic and herb feta cheese.  I also kind of combined this with another recipe I saw and placed the chicken over about 5 bulbs of garlic-I smashed the garlic with a spoon but not completely.  And I didn't tie the chicken so the cheese that leaked and garlic made a nice little sauce.  The sauce is tasty, I don't eat the garlic bulbs. I baked it for about an hour at 325.  I loved it but I'm a garlic lover, I think it would be good w/o the garlic addition as well.

My parents, siblings, and spouse all tried this and they are crazy about it! My sister especially loves dill and this recipe has just the right amount. It's going into our family recipe book on the next printing.  Way to go!

This was easy and delicious! I used oregano instead of the dill. I added a few squeezes of fresh lemon juice before the butter and I used fresh garlic! My husband loved it and said it was a keeper!

Great recipe! I substituted oregano for the dill because I hate dill taste, but kept everything else pretty much the same. Husband loved it, too. :)

This was fantastic.  I decided to just try the recipe "as is".  So many times people change the recipe, then give it a poor rating.  I loved it and my husband loved it.  Served with black beans and rice.  Sprinkled a little dill on top of chicken prior to serving.  (this did take approx 45 minutes to get done ) Will definitely make again.  Thank you Amy.

Delicious!! i added chopped sundried tomatoes as suggested, and basil in place of dill (was out of dill). Also took the easy road as suggested and cut a slit in the breast and stuffed it. Super easy, super delish. Husband raved. success!! This is a keeper.

I modified the recipe just a little due to other reviews. I roasted minced garlic with diced red and green peppers in 1T of butter. I added that to the cream cheese mixture. I also added dill, freshly ground pepper, and shreded parmesan to the top of the chicken prior to baking. Next time I will wrap the chicken in bacon and bake.

A great recipe, very tasty! I actually marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegar with minced garlic and oregano. It was pretty good, but it took longer than 20 minutes to cook!

I'v sampled several recipes from this site but I have to say this was everything it was made out to be.....Fabulous.  I would agree with the others that this is something to serve to guests and even my 15 year old son liked it.  I will certainly serve this again.

DELICIOUS!  I used McCormick's :It's A Dilly" seasoning which includes lemon pepper with the dill seasoning.  I added a splash of milk to process the feta and cream cheese easier in the food processor.  I have also followed LAMBIE's recommendations and added olives and red onions the but I was SO DISAPPOINTED.  Stick with the recipe, it is perfect as is...no need to make any alterations.  The only change that I made was that I used toothpicks not string.  The cheeses were so creamy--I will make this again.

The whole family enjoyed this.  I drizzled olive oil on top and a bit in the pan instead of the butter.  The filling tastes like boursin. It was great.  I used fresh garlic.

Absolutely phenominal! My family loved this meal and it was so simple! If you like cheese, this is the perfect recipe for you! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing that I did differently is seal the chicken with toothpicks. I will definately make this again!

WONDERFUL base recipe, when altered for personal preference, it's amazing!! i strongly reccomend using a flavored cream cheese (i used Philadelphia's roasted red pepper), and whirring them together first. also, stuff with fresh chopped spinach for some green flavour and texture. i also breaded mine, it was fabulous. will make again and again and again!

I liked this chicken recipe.  But when I make it again I will add more stuff to the  stuffing like roasted red peppers or spinach.  Also, I will cook it on the stove top or grill instead of baking (Personal Preference).

This was great!! i did tweak a few things though. lol...i used 6 whole chicken breasts and made the side slit. i used a whole package of feta and cream cheese and added onion, paprika and cayenne pepper to the mix. I uped the cook time to 45 minutes as well. i always have a problem making super tender chicken so i did follow some advice and i marinated the chicken in buttermilk. also i add breadcrumbs and parm. the chicken was perfectly tender and i loved the mixture! delicious!

This one is a keeper! I used fresh garlic and dill, herb & garlic feta like recommended in other reviews, and just a splash of lemon juice.  I served it to my family at Christmas and everyone was saying how it was gourmet restaurant quality.  And the best part was that it was so easy. I'll be making this again for sure.

Yummy chicken dish! Made a few changes though. Used veggie cream cheese instead of plain, used fresh garlic and dill, lightly breaded chicken with italian bread crumbs before stuffing and then sprayed them with butter flavored cooking spray instead of using melted butter. Great basic recipe though. I'm sure you could play with the flavors (as I did) and still get a great result! One other note: I upped the temp to 400 degrees and baked for 25 minutes.

I had high hopes for this recipe; however, the filling was rather bland and the overall taste of the dish was mediocre.  None of the herb flavor came through--if I ever made this again, I'd probably use a bit more dill, along with fresh garlic and chopped onion.

I love this recipe! I made it one night in a hurry, without cream cheese, and it still was fabulous. Serve it with a mixed green salad, feta, tomatoes and italian dressing, and it's a perfect dinner.

I gave this a four, only because I would reduce the amount of cheesy stuffing the next time around.  It was delicious, though!!  I will make this again.  I was thinking of adding pineapple to the cream cheese and feta filling.

I chose this recipe for a "beggar's dinner party" where each couple brought an ingredient and a bottle of wine. It was perfect! We served it with pasta and marinara and sauteed mushrooms on the side. It seemed no-fail and was ready by the time we finished our appetizer.

I made this and my 3 year old wouldn't touch it. DH and I liked it, although it's a little too "fancy" for our tastes. DH said it tasted like something you'd order at a fancy restaurant. I also cut the dill down to 1 1/2 tsp, but that was still too much.

This was excellent!! Added breadcrumbs to the top only because my kiddos want "crunch" when they eat chicken breasts. I only made this because I had all the ingredients on hand and I'm so glad I did otherwise this gem of a recipe may have slipped passed me!! Thank you for sharing this deliciousness ??

Yes, so good and creamy filling, and went well together. I used dill, but cut it down some, added oregano as well. Will use recipe again.

I made this for my family, and they all loved it!  My husband and I are not big Feta cheese fans, but we loved it in this recipe! I served mine with a side of basmati rice and a Salad (Cucumber, Tomato, Onion, Olive Oil, Lemon juice and salt) and some Plain yogurt.  We all loved it, it was easy to make and did not take much time at all.  I used toothpicks to hold together the chicken because I did not have cooking string.  Thanks for the Recipe!

I thought it had too much dill in the recipe which over shadowed the feta taste.  It was ok, but a bit bland.  I won't make it again.

My husband and I loved this! I took the suggestions of others and substituted a tbsp of pesto for the dill weed, used fresh minced garlic, and added some shredded Parmesan cheese. I cut a pocket into the chicken breasts instead of rolling them, too. SO GOOD!

This is a pretty tasty chicken dish.  I may try a different set of herbs in the cheese mixture next time rather than dill - basil possibly.

Before making this for guests, I did a trial run with the hubby and a close friend. Based on other reviews, I added some spices and chopped up marinated hot peppers to the filling. I had some pretty thick chicken breast so I cut them in half, pounded them thin, added the filling and folded the chicken in half.  Then I dipped the chicken in melted butter and rolled in whole wheat panko. It was fabulous but next time I will add sun dried tomatoes and maybe a little kalamata olives to the filling.  Served with Greek Orzo Pasta from this site and some sauteed green beans. ** Update ** I made this again and added kalamata olives, tomatoes and feta to the filling and it was amazing!

Was good! I doubled the cheese mix for extra chicken. I also made a pocket for the cheese and used tooth picks. It did take alot longer to cook because the chicken was thicker. Some of the cheese mix melted out but we served over pasta and used the cheese sauce it made as pasta sauce. So over all it turned out great! Will make this again for sure.

Amazing recipe - I followed instructions exactly, except that I used light cream cheese - garlic herb flavored.  Even my husband, who normally doesn't like cheese gave this a 9.5 on 10.  Thanks for sharing!

This is so great.  I made this for Sunday dinner and the family was amazed.  I put the filling inside the chicken as others suggested.  Next time I will stuff the chicken with the filling and also spread some on top as well.  This recipe rocks!  Thanks so much!

Only change I made to this is to roll the chicken in seasoned bread crumbs with parmesan cheese as recommended by others.  This was a very elegant dish to serve on a weeknight.  Wonderful change of pace from my usual chicken dishes. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is simply wonderful. I made it for the 1st time last night, I pounded the chicken breast out thin and based on other reviews after rolling it in the butter I rolled it in Italian bread crumbs and after it was in the baking dish put sliced baby bella mushrooms and fresh parmesan cheese on the top oops I almost forgot! I also squeezed fresh lemon juice on it. Mine had to bake for a lot longer than 20 minutes, but I had large breast. I altered the filling amounts to accommodate the amount of chicken I had and used the whole 8 oz f cream cheese and extra feta. I did not alter the garlic or the dill amounts. I served this with the Almond Strawberry Salad & the Lemon Thyme rice from this website. It all went together perfectly! I will be keeping this one to use over and over again!

This was just "OK" for me. Nothing special or out of this world. I tried it exactly as written and wasn't impressed. I tried it a second time with premade Chive flavored Cream cheese and mixed some sundried tomatoes into the cream cheese, that spruced it up a little but it wasn't worth the cost.

I halved the recipe and made a little too much stuffing for the small chicken breasts I had. Next time, I'll make less stuffing and add Italian seasoned breadcrumbs as recommended by other reviewers.

This dish was pretty good.  Following other reviews I substituded basil for the dill and also lightly breaded the chicken with Italian bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese.  So I guess it really wasn't Mediterranean.  Update:  2nd time I made it I used Oregano instead of Dill or Basil and liked it even better.  Also added about 1/2 tsp of lemon juice.  Brushed the top of chicken with butter then sprinkled on bread crumbs and parm cheese. Yum!

I found this recipe to be really easy to make, and extremely DELICIOUS. Everyone found it to be delicious. I will definitley make this again. The recipe didn't mention anything about seasoning the chicken prior to cooking. I lightly seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Instead of chicken breasts I mistakenly purchased chicken breast tenderloins which are significantly smaller than whole breasts. I tenderized my chicken with a mallett, and used toothpicks to keep them together. Other than that I followed the original recipe to the letter.

Really great! I especially enjoyed the cheese filling... I used fresh basil instead of dill and it was amazing. I guess I didn't pound the chicken thinly enough because mine was undercooked after 20 minutes in the oven. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. Very nice, and will use the filling combo in other stuffed meat dishes!

This really was a five-star recipe.  I used advice from the other ratings and it turned out perfect.  I used the 3T olive oil and 3 T lemon juice on the bottom of the pan, fresh dill, split the breasts and filled the middle, and rolled each breast in melted butter, seasoned bread crumbs and parmesean cheese.  I did cook them for 45 minutes (6 breasts).

I took another reviewer's advice and cut slits into each chicken breast and stuffed them that way, as opposed to rolling them.  They were moist and flavorful and we really enjoyed this for dinner.

Oh my gosh!  This was so good.  I took the earlier suggestion and just slit the breasts and filled them.  Because of this, I cooked them for 45+ min.  Also, I used the garlic & herb version of the feta cheese.  Will be making again and again.

This is a wonderful recipe. It's quick and easy if you don't pound the chicken as others suggested. Just slit one side of chicken breast open to make a pocket and stuff. No toothpicks or string needed. Bake for 35 minutes. Everyone loved it!!!

I loved this.  I seasoned the outside of the chicken breast a little more with crushed red pepper along with salt and black pepper and I added mushrooms and kalmata olives to the filling.  Served with a greek salad.  It was mad good.

This was really good.  I think I might brown the chicken a bit before baking next time for a prettier presentation.  Definately salt and pepper the chicken before baking.

Great idea but would add a little more seasoning.  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for a few hours.  I added fresh garlic, mushrooms and onion powder to stuffing.  Then I baked with butter and dressing.  I have also made it by adding spinach and artichokes.  VERY GOOD!

This is a favorite at my house, husband isn't too fond of feta but everyone else loves it. The only thing I do different is instead of beating the chicken, I slice it in the middle and stuff it. Using toothpicks to close. Less mess and more filling. Thanks

This was just OK. I read the reviews so I was expecting a lot more, but I won't be making this again. Not much flavor, and I used flavored feta cheese! It was edible, but that's about it. :(

Fabulous! Low Carb friendly. Pound chicken VERY thin. I reduced dill to 1/2 teaspoon, used blue cheese instead of feta and added 1/3 cup rehydrated sundried tomatoes to add a little more of a Mediterranean flavor. This is now a standard.

I cut the recipe in half and didn't pound the chicken very thin but I was still able to roll them up and baked them for about 35 min.  I added chopped spinach and switched the dill for oregano.  Very tasty.

I took some advice from AMCKELLER and used roasted red peppers and wilted spinach before stuffing.  I did not use cream cheese because no one in our family likes it..  I placed in baking dish and any left over stuffing went into bottom of baking dish with about 1/2 cup of white wine and lime juice.  Baked, using my digital thermometer to the desired temp for chicken.  Removed chicken so I could reduce the sauce.  I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock mixed with 2 TBS of flour.   Simmered until slightly thickened.  Cut each breast in half, poured a little gravy over each piece.  Served with saute Brussels spouts and a great tossed salad with crumbled Gorgonzola cheese.

I made it exactly the way it is in the recipe, everyone loved it.  The only thing I would do different is sear the chicken before stuffing and baking it.

ty for easy and new Chicken dinner.i adjusted for two servings so I actually only used 1 Large breast split lengthwise,pounded thin,rolled,toothpicks.made filling with half pkg nuefandle Cheese ,basil,pinch dill,precooked bacon pcs, mozzerella blend shreds,splash of milk to make creamy.evoo, splash white wine ,bottom of pan.dipped rolled chicken in melted butter, Italian bread crumbs,topped with little leftover filling to help make some sauce.the chicken was thin after pounding halves but worked great.small areas that didn't quite cover ,the breading hid anyways.So If your short on chicken or  cooking for 2 ,it's a budget stretcher lol.love flavors,love feta.great recipe as is or jumping off point to be creative!

Really  good, and unusual flavor.  Easy to make.  Followed recipe as written except added some chopped onion and next time maybe some chopped olives. - chopped green or Kalamata.  Sprinkle top with McCormick's  Montreal Chicken.

This was really good! I did make some changes.  I omitted the dill, added 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder, and as another review suggested, i add a half of a roasted red pepper and a cup of fresh spinach and one fresh basil leaf to the cream cheese/feta mix and put it all in a food processor.  I sliced two 1- lb breasts in half lengthwise, and then pounded those flat.  I used toothpicks to hold together.  I had to bake them for 30 minutes, at 20 minutes they were only at an internal temp of 130.  I served this with a lemon rice done in the rice cooker, and there was a little juice/cheese sauce in the bottom of the chicken pan, enough to pour a bit on the rice.  Roasted broccoli rounded out our dinner plates.

The filling inside the chicken was great, but the chicken itself was a little too bland.  The chicken also needed to be in the oven longer than 20 minutes - more like 30.  I might try this again, once I figure out exactly what the chicken was lacking.  Not bad overall, but not my favorite.

I was looking for a recipe that could go with my south beach diet so I modified it a little. I used 3 triangles of laughing cow cheese(herb-n-garlic) then used minced garlic instead of powder. Butt Rub instead of salt-n-pepper and my side was asparagus that i put in the pan to bake with the chicken and cheese. I also just split my chicken breast the filled them and had plenty of space. Saved some of the cheese topping and melted on top the last few minutes. It was great!!!

Not real sure about this recipe yet. Did as directed, but baked for 30 min. Next time I'm going to bake approx 25 min & broil for a couple min to brown up the breast. I think seeing pale chicken was the turn off. Taste was different & not something you'd make often.

I made this for dinner on Sunday night.  I followed the recipe as listed and it came out fantastic. I know it was good because my son is a very fussy eater (at 23 yrs old!)  I didn't tell him that there was feta cheese in it and he thought it was really good.  This one's  a keeper!

This made a great gourmet meal for my mom's birthday, especially with a few modifications. We added garlic and herb feta, Parmesan cheese, and garlic. We also threw in a few extra fresh herbs like rosemary, parsley, chives, and sage. I served it topped with a wild mushroom gratin and it was a huge hit!

Great flavor! The only thing we will change next time is using a bit less filling in the chicken. For the kids it was too strong on the feta/herb taste with that much cheese mix rolled up in it....so next time I will go lighter on the feta mix in the middle. With the potent flavor it does not require a lot!

If it were possible to rate 6 stars--this recipe would get it! I added spinach & roasted red peppers with the cheese mixture and switched out oregano/basil for the dill. Popped it all in a food processor to make my life easier. Wrapped in twine and sauteed with a little EVOO & a healthy amount of lemon juice. After searing I put into the oven to cook, turning the chicken a few times to infuse the lemon. On the side I served rice (for 4 servings, called for 2 cups of chix stock--subbed out last 1/4 cup with lemon juice). I added wilted spinach & more diced roasted red peppers to the liquid mixture before adding the rice--top with feta in the rice if you're a huge feta fan like me...SO good!! Served with a basic sauteed green bean for the veg. SO GOOD!!!

This was just ok. I had two kids that ate it and two that hated it. My husband and I both agreed that it was good for a change but not something I will make often or anyone will request again. Rather than garlic salt I used fresh garlic, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This was good, not great. I only used 3 chicken breasts but the same amount of filling the recipe called for. Maybe that's why it tasted a little too rich to me. I'm not sure. I used someone else's suggestion to season with lemon pepper, not sure I liked that as much.

I have made this dish four or five times since I found it.  It is simply devine...THANK YOU FOR SHARING. The first time I made exactly according to recipe, turned out great.  The rest I added the bread crumbs and the rasberry jam reduction sauce (found in a review of this recipe) and found I like it better this way.  Hope everyone enjoys this as much as my family does.

This was a fast, easy, and great-tasting dish. I've had a filling similar to this as a base for bruschetta - the cream cheese WILL alter the feta flavor some of you seemed to be expecting, if you're looking for simple feta-stuffed breasts there are some great other recipes on the site. I loved the filling, and doubled it to bathe the chicken and small pasta in a sauce. There actually wasn't a whole lot of extra filling for pasta - if you want a sauce, I'd suggest maybe coating the pasta in a light white wine/lemon/garlic (scampi) sauce and then plop the chicken on top. I omitted the melted butter and just sprayed Pam on the pan and sprinkled the pepper and some oregano on top - wonderful. My boyfriend especially loved this, I'll be making it again - thanks!

We thought this was quite nice.  Only change was to use red pepper and extra garlic insted of the dill.

this was very good!  made it for my family and everyone finished their chicken!  i made sure i bought the garlic and herb feta but i think mixing plain feta w/ some herbs will work just fine!  great recipe!

I was expecting a lot more based on the reviews, but we could barely stomach this.  The cream cheese definitely overpowered the feta and it didn't really have much of a mediterranean feel to it.

Pretty good & easy.  I used feta w/ basil & sundried tomato.  The presentation wasn't all that, but the chicken was very tender & the melted feta added a nice sauce & flavoring to an otherwise plain chicken breast.  I'll definately do this again.

Because I'm not a fan of dill, I substituted paprika. It was delicious - the first night and as a leftover!

My husband and I loved this. I used 1/2 the dill and 3 times the garlic(on accident) It came out perfect. However, I would make more sauce. I spilt the breast and stuffed them without any ties and added bread crumbs. I also cooked it for 40 min.

This recipe was like something you'd get in a nice restaraunt.  It was very good!  It would be just as good with a little less dill.  I also used toothpicks, instead of string.

I recently made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  Even one of the guests who can be very picky loved it.  It was quick, easy and I will definitely make it again.  I did not have string so I used toothpicks and it worked well.
