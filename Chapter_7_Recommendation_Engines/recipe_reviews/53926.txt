This was the best pot pie I've ever tasted!!!  But instead of making individual pies I made 1 in a glass deep dish pie pan and used thinly sliced sharp Cheddar cheese on the bottom. I also used cream of chicken & mushroom soup. Very Yummy!!!

Very good but I did tweak the recipe. I sauteed cubed chicken in lots of garlic and half a diced white onion, used only 3 cups stock, and added fresh raw veggies (potato, celery, parsley, carrots). For spices I added poultry seasoning and dried mustard. I agree the cheese is optional but its a nice surprise at the end.

FANTASTIC. Simple to make and delicious.  I added a 14.5oz can of potatoes, diced, a cup of frozen mixed veggies (as I wanted some green in the mix) and 1/8 cup fresh onion instead of the dry.  

I will absolutely make this recipe again; it's great for those cold winter nights.

This was delicious!  The crust is just like KFC's potpies.  I made mine in a casserole dish, and I used closer to 3 cups of chicken broth (that's 1 1/2 cans) & it was just the right consistency.  And I used frozen mixed veggies instead of just carrots.  I omitted the swiss cheese, although I'd like to try it with next time.  I will definately make again, but next time I'll cut back on the amount of pepper (a little too hot for me, but it'd be great for pepper-lovers).

This quick and easy recipe tasted fabulous.   I actually made it in a casserole dish instead of in individual servings and it worked out nicely.  A definite keeper!

I had phyllo dough, and mistakenly thought it was the same thing as puff pastry.  I guess they are not the same.  Anyway, it didn't puff, but came out pretty good.  The recipe needed to have salt added.  I added about 1 1/2 tsp. and that wasn't really enough.  I also added about 1/4 cup flour to thicken it up a little more.  That came out about right.  All in all it was a pretty good recipe, but probably would have been better with the puff pastry.  The Swiss cheese was a nice added touch.  Update:  Made this again with the puff pastry.  Made two casseroles.  One I put the pastry on and let it sit on the hot filling a while before baking.  Don't do that--it didn't puff very well.  The other casserole puffed much better.  So I learned some things about puff pastry in this experiment.  Think I'd prefer the regular pie crust as a topping on these pot pies, so don't know that I'd try the puff pastry again.

we loved this. I used frozen corn and broccoli instead of canned potatoes and fresh carrots. Yummy. I also baked it in 2 bread pans instead of small bowls-- then each person got 1/2 of the "loaf"

I especially liked the ingredients and method of preparing the sauce (even though  it has a high fat content). I used 16 oz. of  cooked chicken, fresh cooked carrots and added some peas. The individual bowls worked well.

Like many others I used this as a general idea and made changes to make it better for me. Turned out great. Here is what I did

reduced it to 2 cups chicken broth and added one can of cream of chicken soup

substituted onion flakes with minced onions. about a tablespoon

substituted pepper sauce with cayenne pepper. about half a teaspoon

substituted the carrots and potatoes with one 15 oz can of mixed vegetables.

substituted puff pastry with a pie crust

Other than these changes I followed the recipe. Cant wait to make it again.

Easy and delicious starting point. Thanks!

I use fresh carrots and potatoes, and add celery and peas, too. I like that this recipe doesn't call for milk, as my kids are allergic. We use Earth Balance instead of the butter. Always a favorite dinner at our house.

This is my go-to recipe when I have left over rotisserie chicken from the market.  I did take a tip from another reviewer and cut back on the chicken broth and added a can of cream of chicken soup with herbs.  I also prefer fresh veggies, so I dice Yukon gold potatoes and carrots, boil them in water for about 15 minutes, then add them to the sauce (after draining of course).  I didn't have cheese the last time, but it turned out really good anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good with a few flavor suggestions taken from other reviewers. I will stop using canned soup and use this method every time.

Quick and easy. Delicious! I used fresh potatoes and carrot which I had precooked. Be sure to Pam the pan.

As-is is WAY too soupy. I found the puff pastry didn't cook on the bottom and didn't taste good at all. However I will definately make this with about a cup less broth and homemade crust.

Very cute presentation. A little runny. I made mine without the cheese and I used fresh carrots, celery, onions, peas and potatoes.

Very, very good. To ensure a smooth sauce, I melted the butter then added the flour. Once combined, I added the chicken broth. The sauce needed some salt, and I added some garlic powder too. I used leftover corn, carrots, and asparagus, plus the potatoes. The Swiss cheese on the bottom is wonderful - don't skip it or substitute a different flavor. I will make this again.

Yummy. Try using 2 cups broth and 1 cup milk. I add Bell's seasoning too. (I also use Yves meatless "chicken" strips and vegetable broth.)

I added some chicken bouillon to the gravy as well as some chicken seasoning.  I also added in some salt as I used low-sodium chicken broth and it was fabulous.  My husband loved it.  The puff pastry cooked up beautifully and the recipe was sooo easy.  You can put in any type of vegatable you want.  This one is a keeper.

This was so easy to make and delicious.  I omitted the cheese and substituted with soy margarine, vegetable broth and soy chicken.  I was able to get six smaller lunch size pies out of the recipe.  They freeze well.

I only used half a stick of butter, and omitted the cheese. I enjoyed the puff pastry but my husband says he prefers plain pie dough on top. This was okay, no wow factor, but a nice everyday simple flavor. I kicked up all seasonings, with a good 10 shakes of hot sauce and it still seemed bland. Needs more garlic, onion, maybe a touch of white wine?

Tasty and easy. I cooked the potatoes and carrots instead of using canned and added some cooked celery. I made the inside part in the morning and refrigerated it until just before dinner when I assembled them and slid them into the oven.

This is a great recipe!  You can use any variation of veggies in it.  I would recommend using only about two and a half cups of broth and half of the butter.  I added a little chicken bullion to it as well.  ENJOY!

This was good. I made it in a 9x9 casserole dish but I'm sure individual ones would be cute. I felt it was a little too runny so I'll adjust the liquid ratio next time. I baked some chicken and potatoes before I cut them up and put them in.

I have to admit, thie recipe impressed me.  I was expecting something mediocre and it was really, really good.  My husband gave it 5 stars too.  My only substitutions were I used fresh potatoes and carrots, not canned, and I halved the butter to save calories.  It made awesome leftovers!  Definitely will make again!

This was great!  My husband loved it!!  I used Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of the dried onions (it was all I had) and used a whole bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of just carrots.  Very very easy and quick.

I made this last night,we loved it except it was salty. I seen where a couple reviews said it needed salt, not mine. I used 1/2 the butter called for, 3 cups of broth, 1/4 cup of flour, a tablespoon of chopped onion browned and 1 teaspoon of garlic browned. 4 skinless chicken thighs, 2 real potatoes, 1/2 cup carrots, 1/2 cup peas and 2 tablespoons corn. I added 1/2 teaspoon celery salt. It smelled just like pot pie when I was making the sauce, so I knew it would be good. {Don't add the celery salt!}  The pie came out great, except it was salty.  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave so I guess potatoes don't suck up salt if they are cooked before putting them together.  "I didn't know that."
It did take me a lot longer then 20 Minutes to prep. I will be making this recipe again minus the celery salt I had added.  Thank you for sharing!

the first time i tried this, it was too soupy. the second time i made it, i added about 2 cups of chicken broth. the sauce was very thick going into the pot pies, but after baking, it was perfect. i also tried mozzerella cheese the second time, and liked it better than the swiss.

Boy was I impressed with myself on this one! The swiss tasted delish. I used a veggie bouillon cube instead of the spices to flavor the broth. To save time I used 1 can of mixed vegetables and next time I'll make the extra effort and use fresh. I felt like a real cook when that awesomely browned and puffy pastry top came out of the oven!

I LOVE chicken pot pie but I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in this one.  The swiss cheese just didn't go with it at all.  The puff pastry was still doughy even after 5 extra minutes of baking.  The filling wasn't spectacular either.  Hubby is the only one who ate his entire serving.  

I did like the cooking method of individual servings baked in separate bowls.  The puff pastry was a nice idea but it didn't cook on the bottom enough.   

I was hoping for something much more.

Okay, but not our favorite. We really didn't care for the puff pastry as we preferred more crust to our pot pie. I didn't have swiss cheese, and after reading reviews glad I didn't. Easy to make, but no WOW factor. I added a handful of peas to ours.

Used this with leftover white turkey breast meat from Thanksgiving dinner.   I added peas and mushrooms, using real onions, with four  soup bowls.   The Swiss cheese was nice but consider it optional.   I will use this recipe again.   Very tasty.

I decided to try this recipe because i had a sheet of puff pastry that needed to be used up. I chose to do one big pie instead of individual as well.After reading the recipe and the reviews i used this recipe as a great starter and tweaked it to my families tastes and with what i had on hand.Instead of cheese i sauteed mushrooms with thyme and garlic and added them on the bottom of the dish.I omitted the potato, and used fresh carrots which i sauteed with onions. To that same pan i added the butter and flour, and whisked in 3.5 cups of chicken broth.Once thickened i added in the chicken, fresh thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. A lot of people stated that the 4 cups of broth made it too "soupy"...if you are making this dish to eat a bit later (reheated)..then definitely go for the full amount of broth..Also the longer you cook it out on the stove, the thicker it will become. Enjoyed the idea of this dish using puff pastry.

So easy, and one of my husband's favourites.  I omit the potatoes and instead add celery and peas.  I also cut down on the broth so it's not as soupy  - sometimes by as much as a cup.  Delicious!

I didn't like the flavor of this pot pie.  Although it could be because I added ground thyme, rather than thyme flakes (who knew?).  But I also didn't like the consistency--it was a bit runny.  I could probably alter it to make it work, but instead I'll stick with my mother-in-law's pot pie recipe.

Excellent!  I used 2 cans drained mixed veggies (carrots, potatoes, peas, green beans, corn) and added some fresh sliced mushrooms. We loved the swiss cheese on the bottom - it was a great touch.  The puff pastry seemed a tad too dough-y underneath, but it may have just been my oven - I plan to bake 30 minutes next time to see if that helps.  Still, the best chicken pot pie recipe I've ever tried!

To begin making the sauce, melt the butter and then add the flour.  Then gradually add the liquid.  We used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 3 cups broth .  We added lots of sliced mushrooms to our other vegetables and it was delicious.  If you buy an already roasted chicken it makes this meal very easy.

The taste was super yummy and it was easy to make. My puff pastry was doughy though and i wonder if it was because the wer ingredients were hot when i laid the pastry on top. I will try cooling it down first next time.

This recipe is one of my family favorite.I don't have members of my family, who like vegetables. I am creative to get my vegetables intake daily. This recipe allow me to add many different types of great ingredients. Today I used fresh potatoes, which I boiled for 10 minutes, then I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, I used all 4 cups of broth; the cream  thicken the sauce. I added peas and corn, no carrots. I used cooking spray at the bottom of baking dish; so the cheese doesn't burn on the bottom. layered slice swiss cheese, chicken mixture, and layer  pastry puff, egg wash, and bake.

Delicious!!! The gravy was the secret!!! I made a gravy with my clarified turkey broth, my unused turkey basting liquid (white wine & butter), and a roux. I also roasted the potatoes, carrots and celery prior to mixing them into the turkey/gravy mixture. I used leftover puff pastry pieces I'd saved and rolled out and re-frozen. This. Is. A. Winner!!

My husband and I are not fond of a lot of pepper, so I decreased the amount of black pepper and left out the pepper sauce entirely. We're also not big onion fans, so I left out the onion flakes and added a little minced garlic instead. I used fresh carrots and potatoes and also added some rosemary. We both loved it; I will definitely make this again. Also loved how quick and easy it was.

[Edit, March 2017] I found a way to make this EVEN EASIER by cooking the stew part in my Instant Pot. I basically put the puff pastry in the oven to bake, then while it was baking, I sauteed melted butter and some garlic in the IP, then added the broth, veggies, and (pre-cooked) chicken and set to high pressure for 7 minutes (though next time I'll try 4 or 5, since the potatoes and carrots came out a bit soft for my taste). Did a quick-release, added flour and herbs, set to Saute, and stirred until it thickened. Ladled into bowls and topped with puff pastry, and it was ready to eat. Took 20 minutes with only a little work on my part.

Solid "base recipe". I ended up making 3 full size pies (doubled the filling with extra veggies and a can of cream of chicken soup). One pie I did just like above, but with Cheddar cheese on the bottom. Believe it or not - it was not our fave! The other 2 I made with store-bought, single pie crusts. One with the puff pastry on top, and it was great... but this was the kicker: the other with Crescent roll dough for the top crust, and it was hands-down our favorite! In either case, I will definitely be using this recipe again; it is a winner!

Entire family raved. Slight changes I made was to use only 3c broth instead of 4c due to reviews of it being runny and use celery and mixed veggies, omitting potatoes. I also skipped the egg wash and it turned out great! Oh yeah, keeping it simple as possible, I used 12.5 oz chicken chunks in can.

I followed the general flow of this recipe, but changed some ingredients to what I had on hand. Microwaved 3/4 lbs of mixed vegetables, less 1 minute from doneness. Chopped and diced 7 small red potatoes, boiled until done. Chopped chicken and boiled in 2 cups of chicken broth, then scooped it out, and added a can of cream of mushroom, 2 Tbsp minced onion, and the spices to the leftover broth. Add more broth if the mixture looks too dry. Sprinkled grated swiss cheese on the bottom of each individual container, scooped the vegetable-chicken mixture into the containers, and topped with more cheese. Used 3 sheets thawed phyllo dough, layered with olive oil between sheets. Cut the layered dough into thirds, fold over (for a total of 6 sheets per pie), place on top of each pie mixture and tuck in around the sides. Paint with another layer of olive oil and sprinkle a little more swiss on top. Bake 30 to 40 minutes in 350 degree oven. Husband loved it. Will make it again, and will try puff pastry next time.

I added some celery, garlic and salt. I made mine in a casserole dish cause I didn't have individual ones to make it in. Turned out good. Will make again.
