An EXCELLENT choice !!! Everyone's lips were smacking . As for the filling falling out , put less inside and the filling will not fall out . I used a pastry bag to load the mixture in them . Worked out great .

This stuffing is excellent in more than just peppers.  It is absolutely delicious in small zucchini once you scoop out the seeds in the middle, like little boats!

This is a keeper and I'm giving it  5 stars. If I had been able to use Hungarian peppers I probably would rate it even higher.  I had to use jalapeno peppers because I could not find Hungarian peppers - I called around to five major supermarkets in New York and New Jersey and they don't carry them.  Hungarian peppers are the mildest form of peppers in the "hot pepper" family.  Hence, if you used them you could probably eat a lot more - by using the jalapenos - this is a very spicy appetizer and not one I would use to serve before a dinner party (I want my guests to be able to taste my food!)  The internet suggests using Anaheim peppers for a substitution, but again, they don't sell them in my area.  The filling is delicious - if you are using jalapenos - I would suggest using sweet sausage rather than hot to cut down on the heat.  If you like HOT go for the jalapenos and hot sausage.  Thank you submitter - this is a great appetizer for sport events and drinking beer!!!!!

THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS STUFFED PEPPER RECIPE I HAVE EVER TRIED! I use one sausage link squeezed out of the casing and substitute garlic powder for the garlic salt. Between the sausage & cheese, it would likely be WAY too salty. This is the only recipe I use now. They always get rave reviews and they are often requested!

Husband and I are complete opposites when it comes to peppers and spicy food: I'm a complete wimp; he can take anything! As I was making these just for him, I added a very generous slosh of hot sauce. Also, I used Parmesan instead of Romano (I didn't want to buy a whole block just for this recipe). I would definitely make this again. Thanks, Russ! (PS, I needed 8oz of B. Evan's Italian sausage to stuff the 6 peppers. There's no way 1/3c would have been enough)

I substituted jalapeno peppers and they turned out great. They had a little heat (some people stopped at one), but they didn't last long. I used the leftover mixture to stuff mushrooms, which were also gone in a flash. Another nice part, was I made them the night before and threw them in a plastic bag in the fridge until I was ready to cook them. I will make this recipe again with both jalapenos and with mushrooms.

Instead of using 8 ounces of cream cheese, try cutting that in half and instead use 4 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of shredded mozzarella.  It makes a huge difference in flavor.  I liked it much, much better this way, in fact I loved these peppers.

Also, don't use garlic salt.  Use garlic powder (or finely minced and crushed fresh garlic) instead and you'll not complain of it tasting too salty.

Like others, I doubled the amount of olive oil and that helps keep them moist.

And, of course, finding good Italian sausage is key to this whole thing.

Very delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly and stuffed the peppers whole and put the cap back on.  Not only were they very tasty, the presentation was gorgeous.

I made these tonight with organic pork breakfast sausage (didn't have enough Italian), banana peppers and used cheddar cheese instead of romano so it wasn't as "Italian". Baked them a bit longer then suggested just to brown them a bit more. They were very good.

These are awesome...my husband asks for them all the time!   I use fresh herbs (instead of dry) and chopped garlic (instead of the garlic salt).  Usually I add a bit more olive oil than what the recipe calls for because I feel the stuffing is a bit dry otherwise.  I have also stuffed sweet peppers for company that doesn't like things to spicy and they are just as great!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  my hubby is a foodie and so when I make something he likes as much as this, I know it's a keeper!  We used spicey sausage which gave it an additional kick, and served w/ marinara sauce over top - mmmm, yummy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were fabulous!  I used spicy banana peppers and doubled the recipe for a crowd of twelve.  I'm back here to share the link with all of my bunko buddies who requested the recipe last night, and thought I'd take the time to mention what a hit they were.  Next time, I'll use spicy Italian sausage for a bit more kick!

so very delicious!  in our awful oklahoma grocery stores, the best i could find were bell peppers and jalapenos.  the seeded jalapenos were perfect, adding a little spice and were a good size.  i also used parmesan cheese and sprinkled a little on top before baking, to add more crispiness. the hot sausage was perfect.  thanks!

These were very good. I was a little confused and tried to stuff them whole, then realized that they needed to be split down the middle (coring them sure got a lot easier after that!) I doubled the recipe, and used a pound of sausage. I am making them again tomorrow! Gotta use up those peppers while the going is good.

These peppers beat most that I've had at restaurants.  I drizzeled a little olive oil over the peppers before I baked them.  I already have many requests to make them again.

We didn't really care for this recipe.  We ate the peppers with garlic bread because the peppers lacked texture.  I thought there was entirely too much cream cheese. Four of us ate these...No one raved about them.  I may make these again with a lot less cream cheese, but will probably just search for a new recipe.

Made these one sunday when I was home alone since I'm the only hot freak of the family. They were very tasty and easy to make. The jalapenos I used were fresh and firm and they turned out great. Did'nt deviate from the recipe and will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

This is Delish! I thought the recipe called for too much garlic salt, so I cut down the amount. It was just right! I also tried this with Pablano Peppers. Nice and tasty! It goes well with anything on the spicy side!

Very good! Best stuffed peppers that I have tried yet. I have and abundance of them in my garden and every year I try different recipes.  I used two links hot Italian sausage with the casings removed. 1 1/2 tsp. garlic salt., 3 heaping tbsp parmesan cheese (that's all I had) and 1 tsp. Italian seasoning instead of the oregano. I baked them for about 30 minutes in order to soften the peppers. I will be making these again.

This is really really good, but I have to agree with some other reviewers that it is a touch salty.  Maybe its the combo of seasoned bread crumbs and then all that garlic salt on top of that.  I'll definitely scale back the garlic salt next time, but will definitely make again.  Great recipe...thanks for sharing!!!

very yummy, i used sweet banana peppers with spicy italian sausage and chopped two of my hot wax peppers into the cream cheese mixture. I'm not a huge fan of spice but my guy is. Settled the stuffed peppers on a bed of meat marinara sauce and leftover spicy sausage. Truly tasty

These are simply the best hot peppers I ever ate! The sweet cream cheese really complement the hot pepper. They froze really nice. I did not add the basil or oregano. I'll definetly make these again!

I would have given this 5 stars, but it was so salty that I could only eat one pepper.  I will definitely try this again, but will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I'm wondering if anyone else found this to be true, or if it's just my tastebuds.  I have really high hopes for this, though.

This recipe is always a hit with my guests.  I have tried this several times.  I don't however know how they are in the oven but I ALWAYS grill mine.  I also usually add about 1/3 cup blue cheese to half. (believe it or not it has an outstanding flavor-and it's always the first half to go!!!!)

This was great!  An excellent way to use the hungarian peppers that are exploding in my garden.  My boyfriend couldn't get enough of them!  I did use parmesan cheese instead of romano.  Thanks for the recipe!

Seemed a bit of work for only 6 peppers, so I tripled the recipe. I, too, looked for Hungarian peppers, or anything close, but no luck. The jalapenos I used lit us up, but were still incredible. I'm glad I took the advice to fill them as canoes... very easy. (Glad my husband reminded me to wear gloves while preparing this!) I'll look for some pepper jelly to serve with them next time. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Wow! I've been through this recipe many times. Doing a tailgating menu for the last few years, this has become my most requested dish. Adding an extra 3/4 cup bread crumbs, and trumped up hot sauce (your choice to taste) makes these hot peppers incredible!! Make sure the stuffing is golden brown when taken out of the oven(keep them cooking!). Reheated on the grill (foil wrapped) makes an incredible eatmore!

Spicy and creamy all at once.  Very difficult to get the cheese down to the bottom of the pepper without a pastry bag.  Next time will cut it down the middle and make canoes.  My cheese did not melt well but I wonder if it is because I used the lowfat cream cheese.

I really liked these but my husband wasn't too fond of the cream cheese base.  He prefers tomato based stuffing so I make the Bob's stuffed peppers on this site for him & these for me.  I make a ton & freeze them on a sheet pan then throw in a freezer bag.  Then I pull out however many I need & let thaw during the day before baking.  They always turn out great.

I thought the dish is tasty but loaded with the meat and cheese it's quite rich and heavy. I used a homemade mexican chorizo and even with the oil drained I thought it was a bit oily tasting.  I served it with a mixed grain rice, corn and black bean side and homemade salsa, which helped cut the cheesy meatiness of it all. Don't think I'll make it again.

The taste is awesome. I roasted the peppers first because I thought they would be too hard.  I also sauteed some onions, red and yellow peppers and used this in the stuffing. To make it even better, next time I will use Mexican chorizo.

Great peppers and a big hit.  I used jalapenos, sliced a "top" off longwise to make a nice pocket on the pepper.  Used Jimmy Dean ground sausage and garlic powder instead of salt, just a great recipe.

I made these peppers this evening and they are awesome!  However, I only changed 2 things.  The first being, I used one 16oz roll of Bob Evans Italian Sausage and substituted the Romano cheese with shredded Parmesan.  It worked out fabulous as 1/3 cup of sausage is not enough.  Also I stuffed 8 peppers and brushed them with olive oil before baking.  Perfect!

This was an excellent recipe, and very easy to make. My family really enjoyed it and said it was an absolute do again supper. I did add finely chopped mushrooms to the sausage as it was browning, it added a nice touch to the 
stuffing.

Yum! Used jalapeños as I like the spice. Also left out the breadcrumbs because I'm gluten free. Still turned out amazing! Ate them too fast to snap a picture.

This is an excellent recipe for stuffing peppers. I've also used the same ingredients aside from choice of chiles and made an outstanding spread. Props to this recipe, if anyone would like to know a deviation to this to make a Party type of cracker spread let me know.

Diced up additional peppers, garlic and some onion and sauteed with sausage, gave the filling a little something extra. Used fat free cream cheese and a lighter turkey/pork sausage mix came out fabulous, even my picky roommates loved it. Made a sweet pepper/gluten free version for 2 of the girls using sweet peppers and corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs. Topped peppers with tomato sauce upon serving.

These were a big hit at a recent party.  I thought the stuffing might run out the end while cooking but it didn't - it actually cooked up quite firm.

I made this recipe with Banana Peppers.  Because they are a bit small, I cut a small sliver out of them and was able to make an acceptable 'boat' to hold the sausage mixture.  I also topped the peppers with Mozzarella cheese.  They were delicious!

a great recipe that reminded me of my gramdmas. instead of the sausage though, i used bacon, and used jalepenos instead of the hot peppers. also put in cheddar instead of the romano and it turned out great, they were gone the same day!

I made these and used about a half Tbsp. of the garlic salt, and they were still too salty.  Next time I would use more sausage, less cream cheese, and less garlic salt.  Maybe granulated garlic would be better.

These were way too salty. I tried three stores and could not find hungarian peppers. I cooked them 20 minutes and they also came out hard and crunchy on the outside. Nobody liked them at all.

This is an excellent recipe!  I can't stop eating them!  I change the recipe amount to yield 8 servings but still only use 6 peppers so they are fuller.  Very good.  I have also made this filling recipe and stuffed zucchini and mushrooms with it.  They also came out great, too!  Highly recommend this recipe! Will make again... and again.. and again!  Thanks!

This was quite unique and wonderful.  My guest and I agreed it was like eating pizza without the crust, which is a plus for those limiting carbs and/or starch.  The Hungarian peppers I found were very small so I also got a few larger Anaheim peppers.  The Anaheims taste great and are much easier to stuff, but need to cook longer, so I'd suggest pre-cooking them for 10-15 minutes before following the cooking directions in the recipe.  The servings are much larger though, so it's more appropriate for a main or side dish than an appetizer if you choose to use the Anaheim.

These are awesome - my wife had surgery and I became the cook for a couple of weeks, so I made these and she absolutely loved them. I did change the amount of sausage to over double and I mix half hot Italian sausage and half regular Italian sausage - I also made them for my church and they simply loved them.

Made these for the "Kentucky Derby" and they were loved by all.  I cut the tops off and filled them halfway.  I didn't remove all the seeds, for we like the kick. I increased the parm/romano cheese and breadcrumbs.  Would make again and again.

Very good!  I have made these twice this week for work.  The first day they went so fast not everyone had a chance to try them so I had to make a second batch and hide them.  I also made a side batch for the dieters using fat free cream cheese, turkey sausage and only 1/4 c. bread crumbs.  They turned out pretty good too!  This is a keeper.. Also, I used one package of Jimmy Dean italian sausage to 2 pkgs. cr. cheese and doubled the remaining ingredients.

I left out the meat and oil, used 1/3 fat cream cheese and 1 t garlic powder in this recipe and the peppers turned out pretty fantastic. I used Anaheim and Hungarian peppers from the garden and filled 12 of them using half of the cheese mixture. The cheese never really melted much, likely from the lack of fat, but the flavor was still good.

I'm giving four stars becasue I think my decision to use up the hamburger meat I had affected the taste. But we thought this was very bland. The only changes I made were to use hamburger & add a lot extra (I used at least a cup), I used panko crumbs & added 2 tsp. of italian seasoning, I used garlic powder & a bit of salt & I used jalapenos & banana peppers. I might try this again w/ sausage.

I used anaheim peppers and sweet italian sausage for this recipe.  I actually ended up using nearly the whole package of sausage because 1/3 cup doesn't seem like enough at all.   These peppers are delicious and I will definitely be making them again.

THESE ARE TERRIFIC!  I TRIED IT WITH JALAPENOS, AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIKE THINGS TOO HOT, THE WORST OF THE HEAT COOKED OUT & TASTED GREAT!

These are amazing, very spicy though. Burned the  out of my eye because I was an idiot and rubbed my eye. Was laying on the couch for 10 minutes pouring milk into my eye to dilute the pain. Definitely a keeper just don’t do what I did.

I had to take a break from eating these before they were gone and also to leave a review. These are AMAZING. I had bought a couple of pecks of Hungarian peppers at the Amish stand on the way home from my parents planning to pickle them, but just didn't have the time so I wanted a recipe to use some of them up. I followed the directions except I used crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs out of necessity. I also used shredded sharp cheddar instead of Romano, again out of necessity. I can't imagine that would make much of a difference in the end result. These turned out beautifully. The filling did not run out and formed a lovely crust on top. I used probably 8 peppers and cut them lengthwise and smeared the filling in and baked as directed. I left them In The oven a little longer than suggested and they were golden brown. I think my oven runs a bit low. I have sausage left over as it doesn't require that much so I plan on making more. They are addicting seriously. I plan to use this recipe again for stuffing zucchini as someone suggested. This is a perfect recipe that can be tweaked as needed. Thanks Russ for the awesome recipe! 10 stars if I could!

Loved the stuffing! But, the Hungarian peppers had a very weird texture with it all.  So I halved jalapeños and topped them.  Now that's worth five stars! I couldn't make them fast enough!

Grew Hungarian peppers in the garden for the first time this year and this recipe is a great way to use them. I made it lighter with turkey Italian sausage and light cream cheese. Delish. The filling needs a bit more of something spice wise but have not been able to figure it out. We are going to make these up (lots of peppers) cook them half way, vacuum pack then freeze so we can enjoy them over the winter.

Great recipe, very easy to prepare. The only thing I'd like to mention is it's wayyyy tooooo salty.  Taste the sausage before adding the garlic salt. Besides, all the cheese will add sulty flavor on to it, 10g garlic salt seems too much after trying out this recipe. I would also increase the amount of the bread crumbs and romano cheese so the mixture stick together better.

Really good!  I doubled the recipe, following the recipe exactly for half, and then wrapping the rest with bacon.  Both were very good.  Got a lot of compliments!

I increased the amt of romano cheese.  when preparing I thought this would be too spicy since the peppers were making my hands tingle, so I made some with green and yellow peppers. they were good both ways, but I liked the extra zest with the spicy peppers. Will make again!

Very tasty, if not the healthiest!  Check the heat of your peppers (touch your tongue to a piece you've cut out) for the sake of your guests...

My family loved this recipe!  We ate them all, and wanted more.  I plan on making these for a clam bake coming up.  They were so easy, and quick.  I think I'm also going to put some red pepper flakes in the mixture also to spice it up a little more.  I'll be making these alot from now on.

These were delicious!  I made them as an appetizer for a dinner party and they were a huge hit.  I used jalapenos instead, which worked out fine.  I also used low-fat cream cheese and will use full fat next time to see if it melts any better.

Very good and easy to prepare. My husband thought they needed a sauce, probrably because he is used to the Italian style stuffed peppers. I thought there was plenty of flavor without any sauce.

I've made stuffed hot Hungarian peppers for years and found that the level of heat from the pepper itself varies widely. Even my own crops are hit or miss! Here's a trick to try to please both the spicy wimps and the-hotter--the-better guests. First, scrape all the seeds and membranes (where the heat originates) from each pepper and reserve.  We never pre-cook the Italian sausage, but  simply combine the raw meat with a breadcrumb based filling.  Chop the reserved membranes and add them, along with the seeds, to half of the filling mixture; leave them out of the other half.  Stuff peppers with the two separate batches of fillings and bake as instructed. Just remember where the hot and "milder" groups of filled peppers are when serving! This dish is always a hit.

I substituted the sausage for hard salami. I put the mixture on the salami then rolled it and stop to the end of the pepper because that’s the way I’ve had them before. They were excellent. The olive oil are used had some truffle flavoring in it. Next time I’m going to fry the peppers in a skillet lightly with olive oil and salt before I stuff them and put them in the oven. I’ll Keep you informed

I’ve made these papers about a half dozen times and they turn out fabulous. The one tweak I’ve made in the past is that I substituted garlic powder for garlic salt. Today, for some reason I made them as the recipe is written using the garlic salt. Way too salty. I will never make that mistake again. Other then that they are perfect!

I used 1 lb Bob Evans breakfast sausage and cut down the garlic salt to 1.5 teaspoons and it was still a little salty, next time I will just use granulated garlic and I omitted the olive oil.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I used Hungarian wax peppers, jalapenos, and also white and crimini mushrooms.   Used 75% of the cream cheese and found it was enough.  I softened the cream cheese in the microwave for 45 seconds first which made it easier to blend.  You could also put the stuffing mixture in the blender.

These turned out great. I cut the peppers in 1\2 length wise as I only had 4 peppers. That way I could over stuff them and use up all the filling.

Way too salty. Watch the salt content of the Italian sausage you use. I used the mild Italian sausage from Kroger and the filling was inedible. Using a small amount of garlic powder instead of any garlic salt might have compensated.

Do not use the amt of garlic salt it calls for.  I think it means tsp. Instead of Tbsp.  Would of been good if not so salty!

These were delicious! I did tweak the recipe a little by adding more olive oil, used fresh basil and fresh oregano finely chopped, minced fresh garlic and a small handful of Habenero Jack cheese into the mix. I placed the stuffed peppers in a pan with some marinara sauce and baked them for 30 minutes. Will definitely be making again!

I used almost a whole one of those Bob Evans Italian sausage chubs, grease and all.  Oh, and I threw some tomato sauce down and baked them in that.  They were awesome.  This is one of my favorite things to make!

I made these today for lunch. We eat a low carb- moderate protein and high fat diet; therefore, instead of bread crumbs I used pork rinds that I ground in a small food processor. We thought these were delicious! Will definitely be making these again. Thank you for the recipe.

I used our homegrown Hungarian wax peppers that were "end of the garden" and bright red hot!

They turned out wonderful! The flavor is just right for a hot and spicy pepper of any variety. I noticed lots of folks used jalapeno's, and I think I'd like to try that next! 

Highly recommend!

Very forgiving! My husband made this after I picked the recipe but he didn't read first, so we didn't follow the directions. We increased the recipe to do a large batch of peppers and so we used 1# bulk pork sausage but only 2 pkg. cream cheese. He also didn't realize he was supposed to cook the sausage first, so it all got mixed together raw like a meatloaf and then packed into the peppers. We baked it at 425F for 45-50 minutes and these were the best sausage stuffed peppers we've ever eaten! We will repeat that mistake again!

I had fresh banana peppers instead of Hot peppers, and not enough of them, so I also hollowed out a zucchini to stuff those as well.  The zucchini was fairly large, so I microwaved it for a couple of minutes to "par bake" it. I laid the stuffed vegetables on top of a layer of vodka sauce.  They were not done at 25 minutes so I went an extra 10.  When I served them I topped them with a little sauce from the pan, and some shredded mozzarella.  The zucchinis were far better than the peppers, but overall...meh. I didn't care for the texture of the stuffing...it was a little too soft.  My husband enjoyed the filling more than I did but he was lukewarm. I probably won't make it again.

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I tried this on a whim bc a friend gave us hot peppers and I had no idea what to do which them(I really don't eat them).  Well, I picked this recipe bc it had all the 5 stars and one of the reviews said this was also good with zucchini. The only difference I made was instead of using garlic salt I used minced garlic and I put extra sausage in.  It was incredible!  Loved it!  I had it in zucchini and I also tried the peppers.  I actually loved the peppers too.  My husband ate zucchini and all the other peppers.  Will absolutely make this again.

The filling was tasty but I think the peppers should have been grilled or broiled first. As is, we thought it was a little plain. I would try this on jalapeño and perhaps broil them to give it more flavour.

I've been making this every summer for 4 years now & we love it! I often put more sausage in (up to a pound & then we eat it as a meal) but usually I go with over a half lb (1.25lb package cut in half).I also decrease the garlic salt & put garlic powder in. Those little changes are just personal preference. We just love this recipe!
