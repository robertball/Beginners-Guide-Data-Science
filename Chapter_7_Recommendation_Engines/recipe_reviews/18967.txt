"Really Raspberry" is really yummy! I was afraid that the almond extract would be too strong but it was just perfect... and the only thing I might do differently is cook the raspberries with a bit of water and then strain the seeds because it was a bit seedy - i used this smoothie recipe to freeze into popsicles for my little girl - she just loved them - and she couldn't even taste the tofu - perfect!

Very refreshing smoothie. Definitely didn't taste the tofu. I cut the recipe in half and used raspberry preserves instead of jelly. I also used frozen mixed berries (strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries). Made two tall glasses (when recipe was cut in half).

I bought tofu especially for this smoothie. I used cranberry juice instead of apple because that's what I had on hand. Because I did not have raspberry jelly, I did not add it. Even with the small changes, it was great. I might add a touch of honey next time but you know, I don't think it really needs it. The raspberries and bananas were great together and both the tofu and banana thickened it up perfectly.
My husband wouldn't touch it (he saw the tofu) but both the kids and I thought it was yummy! NOTE: This would make a GREAT summer ice-pop recipe. Just pour the smoothie into little dixie cups, leaving an inch of room at the top, freeze until firm and stick a popsicle in each dixie cup. Freeze solid.

We loved this drink! I didn't add the tofu afraid my husband would notice and not even try the drink and we cut the jelly in half, It was still super sweet and we both think that we never would have noticed the tofu. I am going to try it again with the tofu.

Wow, this was wonderful. I told no one it had tofu and everyone that had it, loved it. 
I am not a fan of almonds, so I excluded it, but it was delicious. 
My second batch I added a little orange juice and honey.....YUMMY!

Great! Couldn't taste the tofu at all! Only changes I made were that I didn't have jelly, and added 1/4 Cup of wheat germ. Will definitely make again.

This was really good. I didn't have frozen raspberries or rasp. jam so I used strawberry jam. I also didn't have soft tofu only firm, and it was still really good. Everyone enjoyed it.

OMG this is so good.  The almond is a great touch.  I didn't have apple juice, I used cran-raspberry, didn't have raspberries used black berries.  It was very very very good.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!! I didn't use the almond extract nor the jelly, I replaced them with a little raspberry juice and honey and it was delicious!

Had to add some apple juice, but otherwise tasted very good.  Great way to eat tofu without noticing.
