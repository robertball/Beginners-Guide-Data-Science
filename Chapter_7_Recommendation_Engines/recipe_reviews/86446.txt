Very tasty! But manicotti are much easier to stuff when they are uncooked! I make a no-boil version by adding 1 cup of water to the marinara sauce (I only use 1 jar) and changing the baking time to one hour. (For easy stuffing, put the ricotta mixture into a large ziploc bag and snip off the corner.)

This was really good.  The only changes I would suggest is soaking the manicotti in hot water for 15 minutes instead of boiling them.  They are much easier to fill.  They will cook the rest of the way in the oven to the perfect consistancy.  Secondly, I used 36 oz of sauce.  Coat the bottom before you place your pasta down.

This tasted great. I don't know about others, but I had difficult fitting all the shells into a 9x13 pan without having to stack some on top of each other. Fortunately, there was enough sauce to make this possible and keep the shells from sticking to each other. To the pasta sauce, I added ground sirloin, minced onion, and Italian seasoning. When I make this again, I will probably try adding a cup of water to the pasta sauce and not pre-cooking the shells, as I found it impossible to stuff them and not tear them in some way once they were al dente. The Ziploc baggie trick also didn't work for me when stuffing the shells. I had much better success with taking some of the cheese mixture, rolling it in my hands into a tube like it was playdough, and then inserting the rolled cheese into the shell. 

****UPDATE**** I've now made this a second time with spinach added to the cheese mixture (which is a good way to sneak in a veggie since I couldn't even taste its presence) AND 1 cup of water added to the sauce to allow the shells to cook in the oven. It was MUCH easier to fill the shells with a Ziplock baggie while they were uncooked, and I just adjusted the cook time to 1 hour, which worked perfectly. The dish tasted the same and was much less work.

This was wonderful! DH claimed it was the BEST manicotti he has ever eaten. I added some parsley to it and some fresh grated parmesan cheese. *I used a large freezer bag, filled it with the filling and cut a hole in the corner to fill the shells easily* Will make again, Thank YOU!

This was great!  I did take the advice of others and only put the manicotti into boiling water and removed the pan from the burner and let it sit for about 5 min. then filled them.  They finished cooking perfectly in the oven.  Very easy and tasty meal.  Great with a tossed green salad and garlic bread.

HELPFUL SUGGESTION WITH MANICOTTI: I didn't know what method to try on cooking the manicotti just enough to stuff and finish cooking while baking so I took the easiest, and each time it works out perfectly!  Heat a big pot until it boils, take off, stick manicotti in it, and let sit for 15 min!  Take out one at a time and let them dry as you prepare the filling.  I wasn't sure if this would taste gross if I filled them too much and I'm glad they weren't overpowered by the ricotta!  Using a gallon size freezer bag and cutting the end, I just stuffed as much as I could.  Easier to not put ALL the filling in at once so you can squeeze it out the bag w/o feeling really weak (guilty).  I didn't bother adding the Parmesan at the end of baking and w/all the mozz on top, it wasn't needed! 2C of sauce on the bottom of 9X13 was perfect.  Served w/garlic bread and salad!  Perfecto :)

This was the first manicotti I ever tried, much less made. I'm not a big ricotta fan but this turned out really good. For the pasta sauce, I made the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" also from allrecipes.com. I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients but I took the advice of others here (I love simple!) and put the cheese mixture in a gallon freezer bag, cut the corner and stuffed the uncooked manicotti quite easily and with no mess! I then added a cup of water to the marinara, put everything in the baking dish as directed and cooked the manicotti in the oven for an hour. Worked perfectly, little mess and easy for a baking newbie! I will make this again!

This is a great recipe for manicotti.  I didn't realize I had no mozzarella, so I used montery-jack and it was very good.  I used Pecorino-romano cheese for the filling, and shredded parm for the top part.  I didn't boil my manicotti first- just made sure there was plenty of sauce covering the shells, and I baked, covered for 35 minutes, then uncovered, added the parm and baked 10 minutes more.  Perfect!  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  I used Marinara Sauce II from this site- great match.  I really enjoyed this.

This is an excellent base recipe and can easily be adjusted to anyone's tastes.    I thought that this was missing a little something.  Next time I will add some onions and minced garlic to the cheese mixture and maybe saute some fresh mushrooms to add to the pasta sauce.  I will be making this again, with a few tweaks.

Delicious and easy!  I did 1/2 recipe and added water to the marinara sauce so I could have the noodles cook at the same time.  Thank you!

A pretty good base recipe, but I found it very bland.
The second time over, I seasoned the cheese mixture with salt and pepper, as well as some parsley and a pinch of nutmeg.
I cooked the garlic in a tad of butter, just to soften them up a bit before adding them to the mix. (The first time I made it we were bitting into almost raw pieces of minced garlic!)
I also shredded the mozzarella by hand, with the finest grate setting, which helped it melt more evenly into the mix.
It takes a little longer in the oven then stated.
But again, like I said, a pretty good base recipe, just season it a bit and then make it yours with your choice of ingredients!!!

This was a great base recipe that I just tried but will use much more.  Here's what I did:  I used 2 cups of cottage cheese (blended) instead of ricotta.  I also grated fresh parmesan instead of the shake kind.  I chopped up one bunch of fresh basil in place of dried (gives such fresh wow flavor).  With the sauce I added 1 pound of ground beef.  My husband always likes to have meat with his meals.  The outcome was so yummy and it was very easy to make.  Oh, another thing I did was stuff the manicotti noodles while they were uncooked, then I put about 1-2 cups of sauce in bottom of pan, placed the stuffed noodles on top and then poured the remaining sauce over noodles.  I then baked in 400 degrees for about 45-1 hour(covered).  You can poke the noodles with fork to check for doneness.  The noodles absorb the sauce.  Thanks for the easy, great recipe!

Very very tasty!  Family loved it.  Like one other reviewer, I soaked these in very hot tap water for 15 minutes, so I did not need to boil them.  Then when they cooled-- I took a scissors, and cut a slit all the way down one side of each Manicotti shell.  Voila!  Open them up, spoon in the filling, then pat them shut (the gooey filling keeps them closed, once you fill them).  I used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder, and added a few Tablespoons of full fat Cream Cheese, which added a real "creaminess" to the filling.   Loved it!  Thanks..

My son made this recipe.  Delicious.  He added 1 cup chopped drained (wilted) spinach to the cheese mixture.  He used the Best Marinara Sauce Yet recipe (also fabulous).  He split the recipe in half and froze one pan.  We ate with a caesar salad and crusty roll.  There were two left which we had the next day with Chicken Parmesan, caesar salad, and roll.  What a treat for a mom with a broken foot!

This was DELICIOUS!  Made it with Best Marinara Sauce yet and changed the cook time a little (because my 9x13 pan was so full), but it came out perfectly and got rave reviews from my guests!

The filling is great - and I had just enough to fill the manicotti tubes. Thought that the basil seemed like 'a ton' and only 1 egg wouldn't be enough but in the end it tasted very good! Only needed 1 26oz can of sauce - 2 would be overkill.  Also, do NOT follow others' short cut to 'soak noodles for 15 minutes in hot water'  because 15 min is WAY too long. Most of my noodles tore, so I had to wrap the filling like enchiladas. Still tasted great but not a nice presentation.  Cut back the soak time to at least the minutes required for boiling for the brand you're using.

This was so amazing that we ended up making it for my department at work the next week. I did not cook the noodles like someone else suggested and added 1 C water to the sauce instead and cooked for an hour. It turned out perfectly. I do think that 2 jars of sauce is a lot, and would recommend 1 or 1.5 because it bubbled and splattered all over the inside of my oven.

I made this for my very picky husband and he LOVED it! I gave it 4 stars only because I changed a few things. I added a few pinches of crushed red peppers to the cheese mixture and used alfredo sauce instead of tomato. When I cooked it I covered it in tinfoil and cooked covered for 30 minutes. I removed the foil and added remaining cheese and cooked uncovered for 20 min (until the cheese was nice and brown)

This was my first attempt at manicotti and it was really good.  I boiled the water, dropped the noodles in, and let set for 5 min.  This worked out great!  I also put the cheese mixture in a baggie and snipped off the end to stuff them.  I found i needed to put my fingers on the end i wasn't stuffing so it didn't smoosch out the back.  I also think that there was too much pasta sauce, unless you are just sauce crazy (i used 1 1/2 cans and could have probably done with 1).

This recipe is really good but it is very heavy. I halved the recipe because there are only 4 of us and there were still leftovers. Whoever said this was 6 servings must be feeding giants!

This was delicious.  I was short 1 cup of mozzarella so I substituted with 1 cup of cheddar for the inside cheese mixture. I also skipped the egg since I was out of them as well, added 1 tbls of fresh minced parsley to the cheese mix, and upped the sauce qty by 1 cup since I wanted a meat sauce. Used 1 lb of ground beef.

I made these last night and they were delicious!  I added chopped fresh spinach, extra fresh basil and a little onion powder. AND since I didn't have time to make my own sauce I used ROMA'S jarred marinara. It's the BEST all natural bright red italian marinara made from plum tomatoes you can get in a jar!! A little more expensive but well worth it if you can find it. They are sold in Stop & Shops. =)

Good recipe, I use a nice meaty marinara over the Manicotti if you use a large pastry bag with no tip you stuff the shells pretty fast without tearing.

If you don't mind the taste of store-bought pasta sauce, this is a very good tasting recipe.  I've been spoiled, so I had to doctor my sauce up quite a bit with some garlic, minced onion, parsley, italian seasoning, basil, salt and sugar.  Instead of fully boiling and cooking the noodles I soaked in very warm water for 15 minutes and added an extra 1/4 C. water to the sauce.  The three-cheese stuffing was delectable and I will continue to make this often!

I'd been craving the manicotti from a local Italian eatery, but didn't feel like eating out after a long work week.  So, I thought this homemade version might do the trick.  Of course, I didn't expect it to taste nearly as good as the dish offered by my favorite restaurant.  Much to my surprise, this dish was even better!  I am thrilled to have found this recipe.  Now I can enjoy the great taste that I love for a fraction of the cost.  This was my first attempt at making manicotti, and it was much easier than I expected.  I followed the suggestions to soak the noodles in hot water for 10-15 minutes rather than cooking them completely prior to stuffing them.  To prepare the filling, I measured the ingredients into a gallon-sized plastic storage bag and squished it together to mix.  I snipped off the corner of the bag and piped it into the partially cooked shells.  I only had 2 cups of mozzarella, so I used 1-1/2 cups for the filling and 1/2 cup for the topping.  I made Homemade Tomato Sauce II from this site for the sauce.  I'm so glad that I gave this a try!

I am just rating the filling because I made a fresh tomato basil sauce and homemade manicotti shells. The filling was perfect with added fresh basil and spinach. 5 stars!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! It was my first time ever trying to make any version of manicotti at home and it was wonderful!. I've made it twice now and I plan on keeping the recipe on my menu. It was very simple to make. To make filling the manicotti easier I suggest (as a previous reviewer did) that you fill a plastic baggy with the stuffing and cut off the corner to push the filling into the pasta. Much easier. Also, be gentle with the noodles because they tend to rip pretty easily. You should definitely try this !

Made this as written the first time, it was good. Now I cut the mozzarella cheese down to 2 cups and add a pound of cooked Italian sausage.  Also use 2 jars of Ragu's white cheese sauce instead of red, I like it much better this way. Took other reviewers advice and did not precook the shells but added a cup of water and baked at 350 for an hour, perfect every time!

very good! I was worried there wouldn't be enough stuffing, since I tend to be generous with the stuffing. But in the end, I still had enough left over to fill one more shell than I had. My family of 2 adults & 2 kidss ate half this - the kids had seconds (which is rare!), leaving the rest for leftovers. I added some spicy sausage to some of the shells to please hubby. I give it only 4 stars, cause even though it was very good, and I will make it again, I feel it still needs something... I may try adding some cooked spinach to the cheese mixture next time.

Perfect cheese manicotti!  I made as written except that I heated it covered with foil for 30 minutes and then uncovered, sprinkled with the rest of the mozzarella and baked for another 15 minutes.  Absolutely perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I have a hard time squeezing it into the shells with a baggie so I just shove it in with my fingers :) I also like to add chopped spinach to the cheese mixture for some added nutrition. I like to make my own sauce with venison sausage to make this a real hearty meal! HUsband gets very excited when I say, "Manicotti's for dinner!"

AMAZING!  I only used one 26oz can of sauce and it was plenty! And I only boiled the noodles for 5 min instead of 7 like it said on the package and they didn't fall apart but were perfectly cooked after baking in the sauce :) Thanks for the great recipe!

Mmm so yummy and quite easy. Very rich in the cheese department though. You could probably make this with only one jar of pasta sauce and still have enough, our's was almost too saucy.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it twice so far.  I wasn't able to find the manicotti shells (seriously!) so made it layered between lasagna noodles.  I added about 1/3 cup of water to the sauce on the bottom, then covered with a layer of (uncooked) lasagna noodles and used the "no boil" method mentioned before.    The first time I added spinach and mushrooms.  The second time I skipped the spinach but added more garlic and more mushrooms.  The second time I made it I was short mozzarella and had a little extra ricotta, so I made the normal mixture and then "iced" the top with the extra ricotta.    It was delicious both times but I liked it the second time a little more.  There is a lot you can do with this recipe.  Next time I am going to add some sausage.

I'm cooking this now so will update. I added spinach as another vegetable.  I cut the recipe in half cause it's just my boyfriend and myself, so we just needed 2 a piece for dinner and 2 for his lunch tomorrow.  I have the ingredients,  so it can be dinner one day next week also. I brought the water to a boil, turned the burner off, added 7 shells and waited 14 mins. Perfect Al dente.  I only filled 6 shells, one split during cooking,  and I had just enough filling for 6. I put a ball of filling in one end, used a small juice glass to stand the pasta tube up and filled it from the other end. My filling didn't really look all that soft to be squeezable,  so that's how I filled it and it worked perfectly and easily.  I might add a small amount of meat to the sauce next time.  Since I split the recipe,  I wish I had another small bag of mozzarella to sprinkle over it, at the same time, it already has a lot of cheese,  it's more for presentation.  Serving with a small romaine lettuce salad with tomatoes and croutons and a piece of garlic bread. I'll post a pic once plated. Txs for the recipe!

I loved it!!!  That was probably one of the best things I've ever made.  I soaked the shells for minutes, but they still fell apart.  I filled them anyway, pinching them shut and they managed to stay together and not come apart during the cooking process.  My husband is already asking me to make this recipe for our Christmas dinner.

This has good flavor but it was WAY too rich for us!  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta because I couldnt find ricotta.  It doesnt have enough pasta to balance the richness of the cheese and sauce.  I would add other things like peppers, mushrooms, etc to cut the proportion of cheese.  I would also find a different recipe.

This was really good! I did change a few things. I didn't cook the manicotti first. Instead, I made sure that I added extra sauce and some water to the pan. I didn't measure. I used the time honored "eyeball" method :-) However, the pan had LOTS of sauce/liquid. I used garlic/basil pesto in place of the regular garlic. I covered it and baked at 350 for almost 75 minutes. Then I uncovered it until it was nice and bubbly and lightly brown, maybe 15 minutes. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes and dinner was served. The manicotti were done just right, the flavor of the filling was REALLY good. 

I made 1 1/2 of this recipe and it filled 2 packages of manicotti shells perfectly!

I've made this 2x.  First time came out perfect.  Second time, the noodles fell apart on me, so I tore them into flat pieces and layered the ingedients to make an awesome lasagna!

My family absolutely Loved this dinner!  I also did not boil the pasta (soaked it in water for 15 min) and the texture of the noodles turned out perfect-I think they would have been too mushy if I had boiled them.  I also made my own sauce-because that is where all the flavor comes from.

Excellent. I had no problem stuffing shells. I cooked them 2 minutes less than package al dente. Rinsed in cool water with a touch of olive oil. Filled each one by hand, pushing an amount smaller than the radius of the shell till it got thru, then over stuffing at both ends. I recommend soft, fresh mozzarella that you shred yourself. And I line an oblong glass baking dish till it is full with a single layer, about ten longtitudally and two laterally on each side. Awesome. I usually combine jarred pasta sauce in a pot on the stove, add half a can of tomato sauce, and spice it up to flavor with oregano, basil, fresh garlic, and a teaspoon of sugar. I grew up in an Italian neighborhood, and they taught me everything!

Really liked this and it was fairly easy to prepare. Next time I will just boil the noodles instead of letting them soak since I like my noodles to be fairly soft. Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and Romano cheese instead of Parmesan. Also halved the basil as suggested. Served with french bread and a salad and even my 4 yr old gobbled up his dinner!

Really yum!  Only thing I had to change was that I used some Jack as I ran out of Mozzarella.  Also used fresh basil instead of dried.  Yum!

My family loves this recipe. I put sauce on the bottom of the pan to prevent burning the bottom of pasta. It makes a lot so I freeze one portion after assembly. It freezes beautifully. I usually only make it when family is here but last time I made it, it was just me and my husband so even one dish was way too much. I froze what we didn't eat into individual containers and when we wanted it again, I just put it in a dish with a little water in the bottom and microwaved. Tasted like it was just baked. This is a great versatile dish.

I halved this recipe and I have to say it needed much more pasta sauce.  Next time I will use twice as much sauce.  Other than that...excellent dish!!!

My son and I fixed this for dinner. Excellent!! I realized at the last minute I didnt have garlic, so I used garlic powder. We used a tsp and half. Next time we'll go with just a teaspoon if I dont have any fresh. This turned out so good!

I've made this dish twice this week alone! So easy to make - I come out looking like such a pro! I did find that using my hands to stuff the shells was much easier, it also made me feel like I belong in the kitchen! Do not change this recipe, it's perfect! Thanks for sharing!

This was great! Used Sicilian Homemade Ricotta Cheese from AR. Easy recipe and I followed the advice of one reviewer. I boiled water, removed from heat, and put the manicotti for 15 minutes. I'll probably do 13 minutes next time.

My husband is extremely critical on Manicotti recipes... his Mom's "is the BEST"!   However, this one received glowing reviews from him and he ate seconds!   I followed the recommendations provided on other reviews to not completely cook the shells before filling and found that it was a lot easier to fill.   Added additional seasoning for more flavor as well.

My husband who is not usually a manicotti fan loved this! I used the suggestion from some of putting the cheese mixture in a ziploc and cutting off the end to fill the shells. In addition, I added a bechamel sauce at the end which gave the dish a delicious creamy flavor. Highly recommended!

This is a keeper! Delicious! I tried using a plastic bag like a reviewer had recommended but I cut the hole way too big! So I used a baby soon and that worked perfectly! If this were served at a restaurant it would be a $15 plate at least! Yummm

Not the most flavorful recipe, but extremely easy. I also put the filling in a ziploc and cut a hole in the corner to fill the shells. If it was a more time consuming recipe, I would've rated it probably 3 stars, but gave it 4 b/c of the simplicity.

This was really good and I thought it was flavorful.  I only used one jar of spaghetti sauce and just par-boiled the pasta before stuffing it.  I also added broccoli that I finely diced.

This dish was a hit for adults and children alike. I changed the amount of ricotta cheese to 1 cup (because I dont like the taste) and substituted a combination of sauteed garlic, 1T red onion, 1c. mushrooms and a handful of spinach. I also only used a jar and a half of pasta sauce. Delicious!

This is one of the first thing my boyfriend and I made at home together..it turned out AMAZING..I did use the idea of stuffing the manicottie while it was uncooked made it a lot easier and I added hamburger to the sauce which was really good too!!

I took some of the advice from the others. I tried the Ziploc method however, the mixture kept popping the bag open and coming out the top. I didn’t cook my shells before filling them, I filled them and instead of adding water to the sauce mixture I just used a little extra sauce. And the last thing I did was right before they were done I took them out of the oven and added a little extra mozzarella and parmesan cheese to them and they were great. The hubby and my picky son loved them. They both we back for seconds. In fact my son has asked many times Mom when are you going to make them noodle things again.

Quick to make using jar sauce if you are short on time and I softened the shells in hot water prior to stuffing. They cooked just fine in the oven with the sauce and I added 1/2 cup of water while cooking.

This was really great and easy. I did add some Italian hot sausage, spinach and Italian seasoning to the shuffing mix. I also did as the other reviewers suggested and brought the water to a boil, took it off the heat and then put the noodles in and let them soak. Then a baked for 20 mins and the noodles were cooked perfectly. We will definately make this again.

Stellar manicotti recipe! On the first bite, I was expecting the average Italian flavor, but my tastebuds got a fabulous shock! Perfect blend of textures and flavors.  This dish is casual enough for a family meal, yet classy enough for entertaining. I did make some modifications: 1) added ground beef to pasta sauce, 2) added 2 cups chopped & cooked spinach to filling. I distributed noodles between a 9x13 dish and an 8x8 square dish for baking. Served with green beans and Italian bread spread with olive oil. Quite a bit prep time -- mostly filling the noodles. But it was worth it! Will definitely make again!

DELICIOUS!  I boiled water and just kept the manicotti in the hot water (turned the heat off) for about 10 minutes.  I stuffed them with the listed ingredients and some spinach (added healthy ingredient ;)) and put the ingredients in a gallon size ziplock.  I cut a hole in the corner and squeezed it into the manicotti.  Delicious!

I made the no-boil version with this stuffing. It was delicious! To make the meal more hearty I browned 1lb ground beef and poured the rest of the jar of sauce on it and spread that mixture on top of the manicotti in the baking dish. It basically made it more like a form of lasagna but the tubes full of cheese were still there.  I could have used a little more sauce too bad the jars aren't 32oz!

Awesome recipe! The first one I've rated as 5 stars because I wouldn't change the recipe at all. Very good, my boyfriend and I both loved it. I'm sure I gained 5lbs from all the cheese and the amount I ate, but it was worth it.

Awesome easy recipe. I use Jumbo shells instead of manicotti because it is easier to stuff. The only thing I add is black pepper. You will enjoy this wasy recipe.

This is my favorite manicotti recipe.   I usually end up soaking the shells in hot water for two minutes or so just to soften them up slightly, then I let them soften up in the oven.   Simply delicious!

Great recipe.  I never cook my pasta first. So much easier to stuff.  If you have a Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator use it.  Also works great for deviled eggs.  I add creamed spinach to my filling.  No draining and the cream adds a little extra touch of flavor.  Next time I will try a jar of Vodka sauce and a jar of traditional sauce.  I like the creaminess.  Enjoy!

This dish was very easy to put together and tasted just wonderful!  I use a pastry bag (16in), and cut a wide opening to fill the shell with and that really helped and made fast work of it too.  I can't wait to make it again!

I tried the suggestions from others to fill the manicotti uncooked, to add water to the sauce and cook for an hour.  Turned out just right. I also added some ground beef to the sauce for a meat sauce. I will definitely be making this one again!

We loved this recipe. I was a little worried about stuffing the already boiled shells at first. That turned out to be easily done. I used a plastic baggie filled with the cheese and cut the corner to squeeze through the cheese. The mix went in easily and quickly filled the shell. I hope this helps someone!

Awesome!  I thawed frozen chopped spinach and added that to the stuffing along with a little bit of garlic.  I soaked the shells in hot water for about 15 minutes instead of boiling them.  That made it easier to handle.  I stuffed the shells with a plastic pastry bag & large tip, because it was handy...(small circles while squeezing filled it faster than just stuffing it in the shell and squeezing btw).

I did not use 2 jars of sauce. I used one jar of chunky pasta sauce & 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce w/ a little bit of seasonings mixed in.

Next time I'm going to add ground italian sausage to the sauce.

Tasty recipe and simple to make. Since I was cooking for two I froze half of the filled shells for an easy meal later. They turned out very well both times.

Flavor was great and the recipe was quick but I had the same issues other's mentioned.  Not mater how delicately I handled the noodles they all ripped open.  I had to sort of roll them closed.  I was able to serve them intact but made a huge mess as I was assembling them.  I think I will follow other peoples advice and will fill them hard next time and cook them in the oven in the sauce.  The kids enjoyed this recipe.

My husband thought this was really good and from him that is a big compliment.  He is very picky.  I thought it was ok.  I added more garlic and italian seasoning as suggested by another review.  It still seemed alittle bland for my taste.

I just made this last night. This recipe was great, primaraly because it turned out alot better than I anticipated. This was my first time cooking manicotti. My fiance ate it up!!! Next time I make it, I may saute some fresh mushrooms, and add a little meat or itilian sasauge to the sauce, to make it more hearty! If I may suggest, use a large freezer baggie and cut a hole in the corner when stuffing the shells. Makes things ALOT simpler. But over all, a GREAT and EASY recipe.

Loved this recipe, but made some changes.  I cut the basil in half, and used 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh (there is already garlic in the sauce you use anyway).  I added some Jimmy Dean Ground Sausage, that I browned and chopped up finely in the blender.  (Another time I added frozen spinach that I thawed and put in the blender, then sqeezed it dry).  I used the Prego Zesty Mushroom Spaghetti Sauce.  And for the final part of adding the Parmesan cheese on the top - I only dusted it a little bit.  This recipe was a huge hit at my house and I'm sure I'll make it for years to come!

My fiance is a very picky eater, and he absolutely LOVED this! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! I did, however, use fresh basil when I made it. Absolutely Awesome!

This is a very easy recipe, but it turns out great. I did use fresh basil and parsley, but otherwise, followed everything exactly. Terrific!

This recipe was delicious but I added a pound of lean ground beef and an 8oz package of cream cheese which then created enough of the mixture for another half box of manicotti so instead  of three cheeses there were four...this made a great meal

This is my first time making and eating manicotti. This recipe was super easy to follow.  I boiled the water, placed the manicotti in the pot, then turned off the burner.  It basically cooked while I made the cheese mixture.  I added finely diced onions to the cheese mixture (I love onions) and parsley & basil.  By the time I was done with the mixture the pasta was nice & firm-not fully cooked-but very easy to stuff without the mess.  I put the mix in a ziplock bag & cut off a corner for easier stuffing.  Super delicious.  Its one of the best recipes I've tried on this site & I will make it again & again!

I have made manicotti on several occasions, and I've learned that the suggestions by others of stuffing uncooked manicotti is MUCH easier than cooked.  This recipe is basically good but not quite spicy enough for our taste.  I add a little more garlic, some onion and Italian spices (your choice) to both cheese mixture (needs sea salt!) and sauce (I make my own, either with or without spicy Italian sausage; when entertaining, I offer both meatless and sausage-containing). I mix prepared sauce 1:1 with water to stuffed shells, cover shells in their baking dish and bake at 375 for 25-30 min. An interesting and more nutritious variant:  Add chopped spinach to the cheese mixture before stuffing.

HELPFUL HINT:  Mix cheese and refrigerate.  When firm, roll cheese mixture into logs the length of the shells.  Place logs in freezer.  They don't have to freeze solid, but can be prepared and frozen for future use.  This will make stuffing into warm shells a breeze!!!

THIS WAS DELICIOUS! I made this in conjunction with a different meat manicotti recipe. That one was delicious, but this one was my favorite of the two! I followed it exactly and it turned out wonderful. Highly highly recommend! Was very easy to follow as well.

Easy and so good. Great comfort food. I took the advice of other reviewers and soaked the noodles in really hot water instead of boiling them. And used a plastic resealable bag with the corner cut off to pipe the filling into the noodles. I divided the manicotti into two 7 x 11 baking dishes, put one in the freezer, and the other fed two adults and two young kids....just the right amount. Added a salad and crusty bread. Will definitely make again.

DH & I really liked this recipe. But like other reviews, I just thought something was missing. I will definetely be making again with a few of the suggestions that I've read now. I'll update my review then. I generally spend time reading reviews before I make a recipe but this time I was in a hurry so thought I'd just go for it. Thanks for the great Manicotti!!

This recipe was great. So easy. We've just moved and my kitchen is a disaster, but this was no problem to throw together & clean up afterword. I used 2 large glass jars of strained tomatoes instead of sauce & tossed a handful of breadcrumbs into the filling (as I'd seen in a few other recipes) & it turned out great. I find it much easier to stuff the shells if you leave them a little undercooked. All 14 manicottis wouldn't fit in my dish, so I threw some in an 8x8. This recipe's definitely a keeper.

This was an easy recipe to make and it was my first time making manicotti! I added a lot of garlic, onion,and bell pepper spices into the cheese mixture and subbed garlic olive oil in place of the egg. I also chopped 1/2 of an onion and added that to the cheese mixture as well to bump up the flavor since some commented that the recipe as written is bland. I am looking forward to making this for dinner again!

These are delicious! I'm a college student and a bunch of my buddies (none of whom cook as a general rule) and I made these for our cooking game night-- they were a big hit! My friend's suitemates even came out to sample and compliment! We didn't so much follow the numerical recipe, and we had to cook the sauce (we used a seasoned sauce) separately, but they  still turned out pretty great. We served them with garlic bread, hashbrown-style potatoes, and a nice mandarin orange salad. Good stuff!

I love this recipe! My boyfriend's brother always request this! I do make a few changes, however. I add mushrooms because I love them :) I also use garlic salt instead of minced garlic, or fresh. Instead of ricotta cheese, I used drained cottage cheese. I have also found out that some sauces are really watery! I love to use Bertolli, or any other sauce that has a lot of personality. I also add a hint of parsley or cilantro. One of the two. It turns out so good!

I tried this with the no-boil method suggested by many.  I would rather spend the time carefully stuffing those cooked noodles next time, as it became a runny mess.  The cheese mixture ran out everywhere and didn't stay in the shells.  The sauce was runny and it didn't taste too great.  Some of the noodles didn't get finished all the way through.  Especially the ones in the middle, and the middle parts of the manicotti noodle.  My kids wouldn't eat it and my husband ate it reluctantly and he's a huge fan.  I tried to cover it with foil to help it cook better, it didn't make much difference, it's just best to boil and stuff, as they stay together better, in turn tasting better.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was relatively easy to prepare and I was able to give my girlfriend the impression that I actually knew what I was doing?  I didn't have any problems stuffing the shells. A few of the shells ripped down the side during boiling so I think I will take some of the advice below next time I prepare this dish.

My daughter and I fixed this last night for dinner and it was PERFECT! I didn't have any minced garlic so I added some garlic powder instead and Mmmmm, nice and cheesy and delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

I took everyone's tips and used them. I soaked the noodle for 15 minutes in hot water. I added a little extra basil and sugar. Added mushrooms in the sauteed onion's and garlic. Added tomato paste and sauce. Added garlic salt and pepper. Used the Ziploc bag trick and cooked for 40 minutes instead of 25. Turned out great, topped with fresh parmesan and parsley.

LOVED IT! Definitely recommend using a pastry bag or a ziplock with the tip cut off to fill the shells. I followed the recipe exactly, and it's great!

This was a really yummy recipe! I did make a couple of changes which everyone really enjoyed, but I'm also sure it would have been very good as is. The first change I made was that I diced onion and sauted the garlic and onion in olive oil and put in the cheese mixture. The other change I made was that I substituted grated asiago cheese instead of parmesan, I think it really adds some favor that is usually lacking in cheese manicotti. Asiago cheese is very very strong so this change may not be for everyone, but we thought it was great!

Great Recipe! My 3 picky eater sons loved this and one even said "can you make this everynight mom"... Used other reviews and didn't boil manicotti noodles, just let them soak in hot water while I prepared the rest. A keeper that I will pass on to family and friends.

Excellent!  Thanks for the baggie trick; it worked great.  I think I need to keep it in longer though because it was lukewarm but I will make note for next time.  Now I have lunch for a couple of days.  Yum!

We fixed today as one of the items for our Christmas dinner.  I cooked the noodles for 4 minutes and used a large bag to fill them with the cheese mixture.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again and may add some spinach next time.

Easy and so delicious -- a huge hit at our potluck last night! I made two changes. First, I cut the basil in half and it was still plenty. Second, I stuffed the UNcooked shells. Just add about a cup of water to the sauce, cover the pan with foil, and bake about 50-55 minutes till noodles are tender. Four stars because I think it would have been way too much basil had I not cut it back.

Very easy recipe.  I cut down on the basil because I'm not a huge fan and made my own sauce, but this was really good.  My husband even went back for seconds and he never does that.  He said this recipe is a keeper.

Excellent recipe.  Only changes made were to briefly blanche the manicotti in hot water before stuffing, and substituted one cup of the ricotta with cottage cheese (a personal preference).  It was delicious.  I will make this again, only next time will not blanche the manicotta first.  As much sauce as this requires it is not necessary.  It will cook to perfection al dente if baked for one hour covered in the sauce.

I've never made cheese filling before, and I was surprised how easy and tasty this recipe was!  I've made it a couple of times now, and I've used it in other pasta recipes as well.

So yummy ! I didnt change a thing.  Stuffing the pasta is much quicker if you put the cheese mixture in a ziploc with the end cut and pipe it in.

This was really good! I made it following the recipe, except used large shells instead of manicotti to make stuffing easier.  It was a bit bland for my personal tastes, but tasty. Next time I'll probably saute some onion with the garlic to put in the filling, and maybe add some extra italian herbs as well.

This was very good!  I used a garlic tomato sauce to really add some flavor.  I definitely will be making this again.  After reading Chef Joy's review it reminded me I could use my pampered chef cake icing decorater tool to stuff my manicotti.  I put the ricotta cheese mixture in it and filled the manicotti!  It was so simple, and quick.  :)

Excellent!!  This was my first attempt at manicotti and it was a complete success.  I only modified slightly by adding 1 cup of frozen spinach that I chopped, and about 2 Tbsp of dried chopped onions to the cheese stuffing.  I took another reviewer's advice and removed the water from the burner after it boiled and added the manicotti shells and let them sit in the water for 5 minutes then stuffed.  I also used the ziploc bag trick to stuff them more easily.  I baked them for 20 minutes with just the sauce on them (Because they were still very firm) then followed the rest of the recipe by baking 15 mins with the mozzarella and 10 after adding the parmesan.  They came out absolutely perfect!  I made 10 manicotti and have enough stuffing left to make 10 more when the mood strikes.  I froze the leftover stuffing...hope it comes out just as well when I pull that out of the freezer.  Great easy recipe!

Thank you for the tips reviewers! I used both tips of stuffing the uncooked shell and putting the stuffing in a ziplock for ease and it worked beautifully! Easiest manicotti I've ever made! We add Italian sausage to ours and it's wonderful- thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely incredible just as written.  I have also used the filling for homemade ravioli, just draining the ricotta in a strainer for a bit to get some of the water out.

I've only recently started seriously cooking and baking, and this is a cinch. It's so delicious and yet it's completely easy. I will agree that it's easier to stuff the shells when they are uncooked. I make the filling and stuff them and put them in the pan, I just add a cup of water to the bottom with the sauce and I put it in the oven for only an hour. The ziplock bag is something you should use considering it saves a lot of time. I've made this four times already, and it comes out better every single time. Love it!

GREAT recipe. I didn't make ANY adjustments and it turned out wonderful. I prepared it in the morning and cooked it once I got home from work. A lot of other reviews suggests toning down the spaghetti sauce but I wouldn't have minded adding more! It was soooo good. This is for sure a must on making again, and again, and again!!!

Excellent recipe!  I made some small adjustments - I only used one jar of pasta sauce instead of two, and it was plenty.  I only used three cups of mozzarella (two in the manicotti filling and one sprinkled on top) and I omitted the extra parmesean sprinkled on top.  I just cut down on my ingredients and it was still delicious!

The only addition I made to this was fresh garlic (2 tablespoon minced) and a package of spinach to the cheese mixture.  I used another reviewer's suggestion to soak the shells in hot water for 15 min to make stuffing the shells easier, this worked great and the shells cooked up just fine.  Overall you could make this recipe just as it is written and be very happy.   thanks

I made this recipe but with stuffed shells. I mixed did marinara on the bottom then alfredo on the top. Then another layer of marinara. Very delicious!

I made this one for DH and I the other day and we loved it!  I didn't cook the noodles and just added about a cup of water to my jar of pasta sauce, then increased the cook time to 1 hour as recommended by others.  I also filled the noodles using the plastic bag suggestion.  This is one recipe I'm sure I'll be making again!!  Thanks for posting :)

This recipe pleased my extremely picky fiance. I followed the others suggestions and boiled a pot of water, took it off the burner and put the noodles in for 4 minutes. I also put the stuffing in a plastic bag like the others said and squeezed it out to stuff the noodles. Im sure this recipe isnt the most heart healthy, but it sure was yummy and not too hard.

The flavor was fairly good.....there was way too much sauce, it was swimming in it. I followed the recipe to the T, and it was not hot when we cut into in, so it needs to be in the oven longer. Also, I used 2 eggs in the ricotta mixture because it seemed too dry. I wish I would have put the whole cup of parmesan in to ricotta mixture, because sprinkling in on top of the mozz made it hard to cut through.

Very easy, delicious recipe! My husband even liked it. I did take the advice of others and used 1 jar of sauce plus the 1 cup of water and filled uncooked shells then increased bake time to about an hour. Tasted even better heated up the next day!

This recipe was wonderful!! My youngest son won't eat meat so it has been a challenge to find recipes without meat the whole family would enjoy. I didn't cook the manicotti, stuffed them right out of the box. I didn't use the ziploc idea seemed like more of a mess than to just stuff them and it worked great. I added about a cup of water to the sauce covered them with foil and refrigerated them until I was ready to bake. Will definitely make again and again.

My entire family are cheese fans. I made this with a four cheese pasta sauce and a three blend Parmesan cheese. My family loved this recipe. If your family has cheese lovers, I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

I used jumbo pasta shells instead of manicotti, and the final dish was amazing. I added Italian sausage to the sauce to spice it up a little.

Overall, an excellent meal with excellent leftovers.

Very good recipe! I added a bit of garlic to the meat and I didn't cook the shells (increased temp to 400 degrees, added 1 cup water to the sauce and upped the time to 55 minutes) and it turned out great and fairly easy to make. I used a regular butter knife to 'stuff' the uncooked shells and it worked great. I ended up with a bit too much sauce, but other than that I will be making this one again. Thanks!

Easy to make, very yummy, I made it in two 9x9s.  I gave one to my sister in college and she loved it too!  I tried to "pipe" the filling into the manicotti but it didnt work well.  I ended up rolling little logs that slid into the pasta tubes.

Delicious!! I added some Mascarpone cheese to the mixture for extra creamyness and some finely chopped spinich. I used the uncooked pasta method as recommended by others and also the freezer bag with the hole in the corner to fill the shells. Will definitly make again.

I used a roasted garlic sauce and added water to bake the manicotti uncooked...made filling easier I imagine, but still not that easy. I thought these were pretty good but nothing outstanding...they tasted much like frozen ones I used to buy at Costco. Just more work. Twelve year old told me it was "the best thing I ever put in my mouth" though.

This was the best manicotti I have ever tasted. Better than anything in any restaurant.  My husband and I loved it. It was awesome.  I cut the recipe in half and I still had leftovers.  The only thing I changed was I added more pasta sauce because my husband loves extra sauce for garlic bread dipping.

This recipe makes great manicotti just as it is written.  I do prefer fresh basil and will sometimes even add frozen spinach.  I also like to add some sausage to the sauce.

Made this two ways:  one with garden combo sauce and one w/ meat sauce.  everyone loved it.  followed recipe.  cooked first set of noodles for ten minutes and i think that was too long as they broke.  the second set, cooked for 8 1/2 mins and that worked better!

WONDERFUL RECIPE...family said they would want me to make this again!

This manicotti tasted like it came from an Italian kitchen, rather than my own.  I ran the manicotti under cold water right after draining and it seemed to be easier to stuff.

Wow, I made this recipe yesterday. It was soooo much better than any manicotti dish I've had at any restaurant! I didn't have basil so I used dried oregano instead. This dish will become a regular in my household. (I added toasted italian bread with olive oil and fresh minced garlic on the side.)

Absolutely delish !!!!  I added a few tablespoons of fresh basil that was really tasty.  I addition, I used thicker pasta sauce - as compared to just plain marinara.  Also, to "meat" up the texture, I sauteed chopped mushrooms with the required garlic for about 4 minutes, let cool, and added this mixture to the cheese combination.  SO YUMMY.  A definite keeper !

It was okay, I was really disappointed that there wasn’t enough cheese in this recipe to stuff 8oz of shells. I had to pull cheese out of the ones I made to make the last five or six which tore them apart. It makes leaner manicotti than I thought it would. So just don’t stuff them too full I guess

I know some people get upset when someone doctors a recipe and then rates it on their own version.  But that's what I did and it came out wonderful.  
First of all, there are only two of us so I cut the recipe down to make 8 manicotti (4 to freeze for another time).  
We had about a 1/2 cup of homemade pesto leftover so we used that instead of the basil, and I chopped some mushrooms and cooked them until they were really brown - when they were done I threw the garlic in for a quick time to take the edge off.  Since we were only making 1/3 of the recipe I left the egg out (I find it hard to portion a raw egg).  To keep things easy I used pre-shredded mozzarella and 1 jar of Classico Spicy Basil spaghetti sauce + 1 small can of San Marzano tomato paste.  The sauce was thick and rich.  This recipe was SO easy (OK - not counting the pesto, but that can be bought in the grocery store).  It will be on our rotation for sure.

Addendum to my review. Foolproof way To avoid overcooking manicotti: Add Manicotti to boiling water and then immediately remove from heat and let sit for 5 min. Drain.  Pasta will then be easy to stuff. 
I also used 6 Tbs fresh chopped basil in cheese mixture as well as parsley.
 I used 1/2 c. Kraft grated parmesan in the mixture but fresh grated Parmesan on top. Top with small amount of Bertolli Tomato and Basil pasta sauce, then slices of fresh Mozzarella Ball or log (I used Galbani), Then some more sauce and top that with fresh Parmesan and a few chopped basil leaves.

Great recipe that I adjusted a little. I only prepared 1/2 box manicooti (7) as it's just 2 of us. iI used 2 c mozzarella 1 c ricotta 1/4 parm 1 egg 1 T italian seasoning 1 1/2 minced garlic some dried chives & onion powder for filling.  Put filling into gallon ziploc as suggested & cut tip & filled uncooked shells right from the box. Took 24oz jar of Ragu & spread about 1/3 or so on bottom of 8×8 pan laid manicotti on top & put more parm on. Covered with foil & baked at 350 for 30 to 35 mins then uncovered sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top & put back in oven for 20 mins more. Oh my.....BF loved it! Thanks for sharing. PS...This was my 1st ever attempt at manicotti other than with string cheese

Second time I made it.  Great meal.  Straightforward recipe.  Only issue is that, no matter how much I stuff the manicotti shells, I always have a sizeable amount left over.

The cheese filling is not enough for a full box of manicotti. I would say you need to add an additional cup of mozzarella and half cup of ricotta

I used shredded Parmesan instead of grated and served with a side of meatballs. My family loved it. It was a request after multiple viewings of an Olive Garden commercial.
I will be making it again.

This was pretty good. I did only needed 1 jar of sauce. I just put a very thin layer on the bottom and poured the rest on top. I added an extra egg because mine were small  and I added salt and pepper.

I like this base recipe!  It is a great starting point :)  I put more garlic in, and also some Mrs. Dash and some bruschetta seasoning instead of just the basil.  I also used some black pepper and a tiny half-dash of cayenne pepper (would have gone a whole dash but making it for my grandma and she'll notice a whole dash lol).  I used oven-ready cannelloni shells instead of the manicotti shells because I couldn't find manicotti ones at my grocery store today.

I thought it was great!  I have never made manicotti before and it was super easy.  I took the advice of a couple of the reviewers and didn't cook the shells first, just added a cup of water to my sauce in the bottom of the pan and the shells were a bit too under cooked for mine and my husbands liking, so next time I will try boiling the water, removing it from the heat and then putting in the shells and letting them sit for 5 minutes and then stuff them.  Otherwise, it was a hit and tasted awesome!

Followed the recipe exactly. Made 14 manicotti and they were fabulous! highly recommend. Very tasty and VERY easy to make. To make filling the shells simple, only boil them 7 minutes then lay them single row flat to cool before handling.  put the filling mixture in a zip lock bag, cut the corner off and pipe the filling into the shells. this makes it SO SIMPLE to fill the shells.

I added thawed spinach to this.  Don't get mad, it was AWESOME, however, this recipe w/o spinach is also AWESOME.  I just wanted to use spinach this time.
That being said, I did not boil or soak my manicotti  shells AT ALL.  It's  simply not the best way to do this.  They  tear and make a mess and you're left with a dish that really isn't very pretty.  PLUS, it's more difficult,  so why put yourself through all that?  The time you save gives you time to make an amazing salad to go with it :-)  But I digress.  I did what, I found out later, what other people did...I used uncooked pasta, added in a cup of water to make sure the pasta was cooked and the dish still had it's integrity,  and increased the cooking time to an hour.   The result was perfect!  This is my go to manicotti recipe now.
Thank you Sonia for this recipe!  My husband and friends LOVED IT!

I halved all the proportions, soaked the manicotti for 25 min in hot water instead of boiling, grated and grilled 1/3 of an eggplant to add to ricotta mixture, used fresh basil, used 1/4 cup cheddar mixed in with mozzarella, and baked for 15 minutes covered,15 min uncovered, added parmesan then cooked an additional 15-20 min to ensure tender shells. I basically doubled cooking times but it's important shells are covered in sauce during baking to ensure they can really cook in the sauce. Very yummy!

Delicious, delicious, delicious!  I've made these several times and will be making them again this week.  They are just so wonderful.  I too cut the boiling time down for the shells so they would be easier to fill. Snipped a corner off a gallon bag, put my cheese filling in and pipped into the shells.. easy, breezy.  I also went ahead and placed my cheese on top and covered with foil, then removed for the last 5 mins or so to brown slightly.  Served with homemade french loaf and salad.  Fantastic!

Loved the recipe, but did anyone else have a whole lot of cheese stuffing leftover?  I thought I had filled the noodles pretty generously, but had quite a bit left.  I'm going to try and freeze it and see what happens.

came out great! Didn't change a thing! Cooked pasta by boiling for 8 minutes so the pasta didn't fall apart and kept its shape. Then just molded the mixture with my hands and just put it into the pasta! super easy! The mixture shaped very well

Loved this recipe! I've never made manicotti before and this turned out great.  The only change I will make for next time is to bake it for about 10 more minutes than instructed, it was just warm enough and we ate it as soon as it came out of the oven.

This was really tasty, and the whole family enjoyed it, but it didn't knock my socks off or anything.  I tried just soaking my manicotti in just-boiled water like suggested, but most of them split anyways.  I just ended up splitting the rest of them on purpose and spooning filling down the middle.  With four boys, getting food to the table is the ticket.  They don't care if it's pretty or not!  This was definitely a five star for the guys in my house, but for me, it was a little too simple - needed meat, or spinach, or some other element to make it truly memorable.

Definitely an excellent starter manicotti recipe.  But the filling was in some ways lacking.  I love garlic more than most, but it seemed like there should be more than just the garlic flavor in there.  I used the suggested method of stuffing with a ziploc baggie cut at one corner, filling uncooked shells and adding a cup of water to the sauce plus the cooking time of 1 hour.  Worked like a champ.  But there still wasn't an exuberant amount of sauce (I even diced some fresh tomatoes and added on top)  I waited until I took it out of the oven to sprinkle the cheese (would the sauce have been juicier otherwise???).  The sauce I picked clashed with the filling, too, IMO, so next time I'll make it myself or pick a different brand (Ragu is awesome).  The recipe is a keeper, but feel free to tinker with flavors!

This was a hit with everyone in my family. I made the "World's Best Pasta Sauce" from this site, adding sauteed baby bella mushrooms. I soaked the manicotti shells in hot water for 5 minutes & filled using the plastic bag with the tip cut off method, & they were a breeze to fill because the shells were still firm. I added a cup of water to my sauce & cooked for an hour. The result was a firm, delicious Manicotti. The mixture of cheeses: Wonderful!

The recipe was good, but I made some changes, I added garlic and onions to the cheese mixture.  I added spinach as well.  I did not boil the manicotti through, I boiled it for 3-4 mins and and then filled it.  I wish I had listened to others and put the cheese mixture in a zip lock bag because it was a pain to get the mix inside.  But it tasted great, my son & husband loved it!

I really liked these. It was the first time ever that I made manicotti, and it was really easy. I didn't like the pasta sauce that I used(I tried a new one that I have never had before), so next time I make these I'll be using a different sauce. My husband loved them!

Will add ground beef next time to zest it up a bit.It was easy to fill the shells, just used a large ziploc bag and piped the cheeses into the pasta. Although I thought it was alittle bland I will make again.

i thought this was a great recipe.  it was really easy.  i used small curd breakstones creamy cottage cheese instead of ricotta because i had it in the fridge.  and i found it very easy to use the barilla no boil lasagna noodles.  i soaked them in hot water for about 5 min and then rolled the filling up inside them.  it was SOOO much easier than filling shells.

Really easy recipe, and super delicious.  Added more garlic, being a garlic fan.  Will try the "no-boil" method seen in other reviews next time.

I made this for my husband, and he loved it!  Personally, I thought it needed a bit more flavor, but if my husband approves, then it's a winner.  I also did not boil the noodles.  They got soft enough to be thoroughly cooked, but they were hard enough to stuff.  I think next time I will do half of them with onions in them and the other half with sliced pepperonis to see what happens.

I loved this recipe, I followed a previous tip to put the noodles in the boiling water and then remove the pot from heat. The noodles were much easier to fill. I also sauteed garlic and onion to add to the cheese mixture.

This was the first time I have made manicotti and it turned out great! I added spinach and chicken to the cheese mixture to make it more of a complete meal by itself. Thought the mixture could have used a little salt though. I also took the advice of others and used uncooked shells and baked it for around 50 minutes adding the mozzarella cheese with about 10 minutes left. I will definitely be making this again!

this was really tasty. i stuffed the inside with ricotta, mozarella, egg and spinach. and i used beef pasta sauce instead of plain. i always underboiled the paste shells a bit so they were easier to stuff. i filled a ziplock bag with the mixture and then cut off one end and piped it in like that. will def be making again. thanks for sharing!

I made this with some improvements as suggested by others.  I only boiled the pasta for five minutes and then left it in the hot water as I prepared everything else.  I found this allowed for a firm pasta that I could stuff easier.  I also added onion, garlic and mushrooms sauted in olive oil with a package of frozen (thawed) chopped spinach to the cheese mixture.  All of this on the advice of others.  I did cook it for an additional fifteen minutes.  This was exceptionally good!!  I will definately make it again.  I only gave it four stars because of the adjustments I made to it.  But it is one of those dishes that can blossom into something really tasty as you see fit!

Wonderful! I did not follow other's advice and went ahead and boiled the shells...Next time I will listen, lol! Other than the stuffing being difficult, it was an easy and tasty dish. Next time I think I'll add onions and spinach.

delicious simple recipe!  I also soaked the shells in hot water for 15 minutes rather than boiling for easy stuffing.  This dish came out perfectly.

I made this dish for some friends and family and everyone LOVED  it (including my children).  I took the advice from several others and stuffed the cheese mixture (with a corner cut in a plastic bag) when the shells were hard.  I added a cup of water to the sauce along with a pound of hamburger meat. I actually made this dish in the morning, refrigerated it, and cooked it that night for supper for an hour and it was fantastic!  Definitly something you can prepare ahead of time.

This was good and easy to make. I sliced the shells in half then stuffed and closed. Much easier. Be careful not to overboil the noodles though or they will get soggy.

this was excellent--the basil was a nice change from the usual parsley i've seen in other recipes. try making your own wrappers for a truly wonderful dish. (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Manicotti-Shells/Detail.aspx?prop31=6)

This is quick, easy, and pretty good! 3 out of 5 of us loved it. The other two are toddlers and are VERY picky eaters. But they ate it for the most part. We'll be fixing this again!

We enjoyed this recipe very much! Just a tip for others...I use my cookie/cupcake frosting decorator to fill the cooked shells. It works perfectly for me. So if you happen to have one I would suggest using it!

increase bake time to at least 45 minutes if not cooking noodles all the way.  Try adding fresh cut spinach to mix next time.

I made savory crepes and used this filling recipe.  I was afraid there would be too much basil but it turned out wonderful.  My guests raved over it and my husband said it's a keeper.

My family loved the recipe. I followed the advice of filling the uncooked shells and cooking with extra sauce and water for 1 hour. Turned out perfectly. Although I had a really hard time using the plastic bag to fill the shells. The filling was just to thick to push through. It worked better for me to use a butter knife and push the filling into the shells. Overall the recipe was very, very good.

Very good, needs just a little more seasoning. I threw in some Italian seasoning and extra basil and garlic. Also the best method for stuffing the shells is defiantly letting the soak in hot water for 10-15minutes and then rolling cheese mixture like playdough and stuffing it inside them, make sure to add a few minutes to your cook time though.

Next time I will use less parmesan cheese, but that is just a personal prefrence. It was good, and the whole family liked it.

We LOVED this!  I made it as written with the exception of using my own spaghetti sauce that I had left over from a previous meal.  This made A LOT!  My hubby and I each had one and the kids split one (they're small children); which was more than enough with a salad and garlic bread.  I'm ok with it being so much because now I have several meals made that I can pull from the freezer on a day that I don't want to mess with cooking something.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and this one is definitely going into our regular rotation of meals and I'll be sharing with my friends and family.  Yum!

This was very good!  Instead of stuffing the manicotti, I boiled them, sliced them open, then spooned the filling in & re-rolled them, placing them cut-side down into the dish.  Much easier than stuffing them!  I did find the recipe to be pretty salty, but that's to be expected with so much cheese & pasta sauce.  Next time I will try a reduced-sodium tomato sauce and maybe a little less Parmesan.  Overall, though, an excellent recipe, and very easy!

I just made this tonight and it was a big hit with the family. My picky eater even asked for seconds!! The only thing I changed was the seasonings. I was out of both garlic and basil, but I had something called "Italian Seasoning"...so that is what I used. It turned out great!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I can't say that I like to make manicotti, but this recipe with the suggestion of not cooking the shells first was for me.  I definately enjoy making this for my husband more now that it isn't going to fall apart in my hand.

this was delicious. the only negetive for me was that the extra mozzarella on top was a bit of overkill. i would have never thought it was possible to have too much cheese but this proved me wrong! i will make this again sans the cheese on top.

this was very, very good.  i added some ground beef since i don't care for the  texture of ricotta alone.  i took everyone else's advice and added one cup of water to the sauce and did not bake the shells.  they were perfect after about 40 minutes of baking time. this one is a keeper.

Wow - this was great!  I added some hot sausage to the mixture.  I also tried the ziploc method for stuffing... it took some getting used to but worked wonderfully in the end.  I did not boil or soak the pasta first and to my surprise - it turned out fantastic - the cooking time was just increased by about 15 mins.  Like another person suggested, I tried the marinara sauce II recipe.  I was told that it was the best italian dish ever!  If I could give it more stars I would!!

Great fast and easy recipe! To cut more corners and add more flavor I substituted our store brand's Italian Blend of cheeses for the Parm and Mozz cheeses, just combined the amounts!

I made this recipe with a few variations of my own. It was awesome!
I used a jar pasta sauce, but cooked up half ground beef and half italian sausge and poured that over the top of the stuffed manicotti. I boiled the pasta for about 4 minutes and baked it for about 20 minutes, added the motzerella cheese and baked about 5 more minutes and they turned out perfect!
I didn't like the idea of using a freezer bag like a piping bag to stuff the shells. My mixture was too thick for that so I did what another reviewer did. I rolled my filling in a tube like I was rolling play-dough and that worked perfect. 
We'll be making this again sometime soon!

It was so GOOD! I had to add my own personal touch to it. I browned italian sausage and ground meat drained added fresh mushrooms, lots of garlic, and onion (brown it to). Threw in a can of italian diced tomatoes and a cup of white wine. I added chilepowder, italian seasoning, basil, oregeno, and parsley. Oh and a few cans of tomato sauce too. I took half of the meat mixture kinda strained it and mixed it with the cheese mixture. For the cheese mixture I used the bag of italian blend, added ricotta, and fresh parmesan. I then poured the sauce over the manicotti and baked it long enough for the egg to be cooked. It was so good my hubby can't wait for left overs. I think next time I will add spinach. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was a great, simple recipe for manicotti. I kind of overstuffed the pasta, so I didn't get to fill them all. It was great nonetheless! I also added ground pork sausage to the sauce.

I followed this best I could, that is I made it my own, i used my food processor and in with the ricota and mozza went half pack of thawed spinich drained and 2 cooked chicken breast from the night before.  I then stuff cooked manacotti tubes and use one jar of sauce. covered with remaining cheese and baked.  It was great! The only thing I am going to change next time is using 2 jars of sauce.

MMMMMMMmmmmmm! My husband is not such a pasta fan but he ate this and went back for seconds. I substituted the basil for Italian seasoning b/c its what I had on hand. Also cooked up some Italian sausgae and mixed with the cheese mixture. So pleased with the end result!

I loved this!  I did cheat though and used lasagna noodles (as another poster had mentioned) and spread the filling and then rolled them up.  My DD is vegetarian so try to find a couple meatless meals each week that the whole family can enjoy and this will be a regular, we all loved it!!  Thanks!

This was really yummy!  My kids and husband loved it.  It is very much like lasagna but much cheesier.  For our family it made way too much.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.  I used only about 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce as my son doesn't like red sauce that much and it was still plenty saucy and not dry.

I made this twice sense i found the recipe online it is great. I love it to death and it works out perfect because it tastes like it takes hours to get right, but im a beginner and i didn't mess anything up on this. Very simple and easy to prepare, and anybody can enjoy it.

Delicious! I made this for a dinner party and everybody raved about it. The cheese filling is fantastic. I used a home-made sauce instead of a jar. Yum.

I made this for dinner tonight and it turned out very good. Simple recipe to follow. I used a ziploc bag and snipped the corner to stuff the manicotti and it worked quite well. Even my picky eater liked this one. Will definitely make again.

I have made this several times and it is wonderful.  I also decided to cook up some Italian Sausage and add that to the cheese mixture.  It taste great both ways.  Thanks for the idea to stuff the shells by using a plastic bag with the corner snipped off.  It is much easier that way.

All I have to say is it's delicious! My family absolutely loves this dish as do I. I was looking for a tasty manicotti recipe that didn't have spinach in it because my dad doesn't like it. Anyway this is my favorite dish!

This recipe was very good and quite easy to make!  I followed the advice of several other reviewers and stuffed the shells while they were still hard using a ziplock baggy with the corner cut off (next time I will cut a smaller piece).  This made the filling of the shells so very easy.  I put sauce on the bottom of the pan, then the shells.  I poured about a cup of water over the shells, making sure each shell had gotten watered, then put the rest of the sauce over it all.  Baked about 1 and 15 minutes.  Husband loved it!  So did I!  Will make again.

I had never attempted to make any thing like this before.  It was so easy and just delicious.  I did how ever use the shredded parmasian the second time I made it and also added italian seasonings to the pasta sauce.  That did make it more to my taste.  It was a big hit at home and at work.  I will definitely make it again.

Comes out delicious!  I didn't modify the recipe at all.  However, I still have trouble trying to stuff the shells without breaking them.  *****UPDATE***** I added 1C of water to the sauce and made sure to cover the pasta entirely with it then cooked it for a little over an hour!  Came out perfect and they were much easier to stuff without boiling first.

Absolutely my favorite.  Everyone asks for me to make it again and again.  I've recently started adding some ground italian sausage to give it a little more but it doesn't need it.  AMAZING!!

Wow! This was my first time making anything like manicotti and it was a wonderful first-time recipe for me! I made a few changes to what is originally here. I added ground beef to the sauce to give it more protein. I also added another egg to the cheese mix as it seemed a little dry when I mixed it. Per another suggestion on here, I stuffed the manicotti uncooked and added water to the sauce before I cooked it and it turned out great. Everyone that ate with us that night LOVED this meal and the leftovers were almost as good as the original dish!  Next time I will try adding Italian Sausage to the sauce for an extra kick!

Pretty good because it is so cheesy.  It is also so saucy that you better really like the sauce you use.

Good basic recipe however, I will use large shells next time instead as they are much easier to stuff and don't split as easily.

This was good, but I would add more sauce on top because it was very rich. Good meal though.

Huge hit with my family.  Even my toddlers LOVED it!  It's my husbands new favorite meal.  I did add some beef to it but i'm sure it would be just as good with out or with sausage or chicken.

This was excellent!! 
I added a little extra garlic and seasoning to the cheese mix as I was afraid it would be a little bland and it was great! 
I made my own meat sauce to my liking as well.  This was a huge hit with both my husband and 4 year old.  I loved it too.  Both have asked to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely make again.

This was slightly bland.  It was good- but I really feel it was missing any sort of "wow" factor.  My husband ate it- one time mentioned that it was good and neglected to take the left-overs for lunch today (Meaning that it wasn't THAT good).  I think I'll keep looking for a manicotti recipe that has a "WOW" factor.

This turned out fantastic. I didn't realize it would make so much though. I used the 6 serving recipe and I ended up with 2 pans full. We saved one for another night. It was great!

I made this using 1/2 the basil and Marinara sauce. I think the marinara sauce was a little too over-powering for this basic manicotti recipe. Something was missing from it but I cant quite put my finger on it. I will try again and report back.

Great!  We will have this again.  I did add spinach to the cheese mixture, as well as meat to the sauce.  Other than that, I kept the recipe the same.  My husband loved it !  Next time I may try to season it a little more, as I found it a little under seasoned.  But over all it was great!

Wow!  What a wonderful recipe.  My husband doesn't like parmesan cheese, so I didn't add that to the stuffing.  Also, I made a meat sauce as opposed to just pasta sauce.  It was quite a hit!  I will definately be making this again.

I thought this was a great start... I added more garlic and my own seasonings to a 'jarred sauce'.  I also added ground meat to the sauce.  This was a big hit with everyone.. even my picky eater!!! I also added more cheese, and even though I didn't have enough Mozzerella for the top, I used Provolone and it was great! THANKS

I made this for company and thought it turned out well.  I browned a half pound of hamburger with minced garlic and about a half cup of chopped pepperoni.  I added half of the meat mixture to the pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan and the other half of the meat mixture to the pasta sauce on the top of the manicotti.  I ran out of mozzarella cheese for the top and instead used an Italian cheese blend.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Wow! Very tasty. I added some garlic and onion. I think if I was to make this again, I'd make a meat sauce instead of using just the tomatoe sauce. It would make it a little more hearty. Still very good though :)
