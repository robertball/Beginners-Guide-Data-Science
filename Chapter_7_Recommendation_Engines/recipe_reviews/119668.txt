I'm not a big fan of brie, but thought I'd try this recipe anyhow. It was too sour and pungent for my taste - the cheese ends up very strong! So if you like brie, go for it! If you don't...well...take caution.

This makes way too much for the two of us so I prepared one third of the recipe. I lightened it up a bit by eliminating the olive oil and added a little bit more tomato.  Still rich and wonderfully delicious!  I can't imagine what the additional olive oil could add besides a lot of calories.  I will indulge with this dish again and again!

This is amazing!  One of my favorites, so easy, with a great, light creaminess added by the brie.  Yum.

It is super quick and easy to make, and is so light. Can go with chicken or fish or as is, love it. Making it for 3 years now!
