I made this recipe this week, with one change:  the recipe I had called for only 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  It was delicious, and the sauce wasn't too thin.  The leftovers made great barbecue sandwiches, too.  I appreciated how easy it was, and that it used ingredients I already had on hand.

We really liked this dish!  I did a couple of changes though after reading others posts. I seasoned my pork with onion salt, pepper, salt, garlic powder and salt..then browned it on both sides with olive oil.  I did 8 oz chicken broth in lieu of 10.5 of condensed chicken broth...  and I sliced my oions instead of chopped.  I also drizzled honey lightly over the pork roast.

This is a good idea, but for my family's tastes, it was a bit lacking.  Most meat dishes with fruit-based sauces or glazes need a good bit of "savory" to offset the sweetness.  On the second try of this recipe I tweaked it, and my family went CRAZY for it:  2.5 lb pork roast, 1/2 jar apricot preserves, 1 rounded TBL of dry onion soup mix, NO added liquid.  Seasoned the roast with garlic, seasoned salt, black pepper, and quickly seared in a saute pan; deglazed the pan with a MINIMAL amount of water, added to sauce mixture.  Place roast in crock, cover with sauce, cook on low for 4.5 hours.  WOW!!!  The liquid from the meat brings the sauce to almost the right consistency, but I did need to add about a TBL of corn starch and simmer on high for a few minutes to thicken.  Served with home-made dinner rolls, mashed potatoes, steamed green beans.  Like I said, as written, my family (all male, all carnivores) thought it was ho-hum, but with tweaking it was "Man, Mom!  This is awesome!!"

For an extra tang, I add a few fresh cranberries and it is wonderful.  I also add potatoes, mushrooms and carrots for a complete dinner.  This received rave reviews from family and friends.  I have made it four times and again this weekend while skiing.

This recipe was so good everyone, even my 4 & 6 yr olds asked for seconds! I made a few changes that were suggested in other reviews to give it a little more flavor. I seasoned it with Montreal steak seasoning & salt, then browned it in olive oil before putting it in the crockpot. I also sliced the onions instead of chopping them, used 8oz of chicken broth instead of the condensed, and drizzled it with honey!! Will definantly make again!

I thought the meal was great!  The pork pulled apart and had a nice flavor.  Not as strong as I thought it would be.  I used 2 lbs pork, a full can of preserves, and half the can of broth.  Good consistency in the sauce!

I made this for dinner tonight for my roommate and I for dinner and is was great.  We both had seconds.  Added some garlic gloves to the roast.  Which is something we don't usually do so that we have room for dessert.  We were so full we skipped dessert.

This was just OK for me. I wasn't sure what condensed chicken broth was, so I just used about a cup of chicken stock. I added potatoes and carrots to the crock pot as well. It was all just a little too bittersweet tasting to me. Could've used something to cut the sweetness a little, but I'm not sure what. The apricot preserves give it a tangy taste that was a little overwhelming.

AWESOME!!!  I have never liked Pork my entire life, but I LOVED this!  OMG, i couldn't quit eating it!  It came out so tender after 3 hours on High (I had a 2 pound pork roast).   The only changes I made:  1/2 can of Broth, omitted the mustard (didn't have any), added Baby Carrots to the mix, and also added various spices:  Onion Powder, Salt, Pepper, Dill Seed, Parsley, and Oregano.  This is a great Sunday afternoon recipe.  thank you!!

OMYGOD this was HEAVENLY. my husband was very skeptical when he saw the combo of "jelly & mustard" in the crock pot (& he actually wasnot looking forward to dinner:( BUT did he swallow his words! (along w/this DELISH dish) i actually used a whole can of broth. (TIP: i couldnot find this "condensed chix broth" in the soup aisle at my local ralphs... but i found it in the campbells soup section which has their cans laying on their side in roller dispensers) i bought a 2.65 lb tenderloin & cooked on low for 7 hrs. unfortunately, some parts of the pork were drier than other parts, but the tastiness outweighed the bad! i also scooped some of the drippings when it was done & brought it to a light boil on the stove top w/a full tsp of corn starch to make the BEST gravy ever.
tip: i served the pork on a bed of sauteed mustard greens, w/ mashed sweet potatoes, roasted yellow squash, & biscuits! i can NOT wait to make this again!

Delicious and easy to make. Followed the suggestions of others and rubbed salt, pepper, garlic powder and some crushed rosemary into the roast. Poured the glaze (no broth) over the roast and then added the sliced onion with a half cup of water drizzled around the edges of the roast; covered and cooked on high in the slow cooker for just over 5 hours. Didn't have any chicken broth, but my experience with slow-cooked roasts is that you don't need a lot of liquid - the meat has enough juices of its own. It came out with about 4 cups of liquid at the end which made a good gravy with some more seasonings and cornstarch. Definitely a keeper!

I was very disappointed in this.  I thought with all of these stars it would be really tasty- but it was actually quite bland and I'm sure there would always be a better option.  The sauce was orangish brown with little chunks of onion floating in it- very unappetizing looking.  I suggest trying something else.

LOVED IT! easy to prepare. We served it over steamed rice which helped with the ample liquid. The amount of juice was a plus for us. The only down side was that the pork was slightly dry, but again the juice compensated for that.

A "keeper" for sure!!  Used only 1/2 can of chicken broth, so the gravy was just right.  Awesome pulled pork sandwiches the next day as leftovers.

I didn't think this was very good. The sauce is quite bland; it definitely needs something. I suppose one could edit the ingredients to make it more flavorful, but I would rather use a different recipe altogether. The sauce was also very thin even after adding cornstarch at the end.

One of my GoTo recipes that I have made for years, even for company.  I always brine the loin over night (2 quarts of apple juice, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup sugar) – I think this is very important if you want a juicy pork roast regardless of how it is cooked.  Also, throw a bag of baby carrots into the slow cooker, they are fantastic!  I tried to duplicate the carrots in the slow cooker without the pork and they were just not the same.

I put a dry rub on meat overnight. Super easy to do while your at work. I did use sugar free preserves and added some carrots and onion and turned out perfect. I was afraid the pork loin would burn with out putting a 1/4c  chicken stock, but next time I won't add it. I had to use corn starch at the end and boil to get it thick, but other than that pork was super tender! Served with mashed potatoes. Will make again. Easy and healthy.

I added in a can of cream of mushroom to thicken the sauce up at the end with a tablespoon of cornstarch.  It did thicken up and had a great taste.  Next time I will season the roast before I put it in the crock pot - salt and pepper rubbed into the skin to add more flavor there.  I made it with smashed red potatoes and my husband, three year old and I really liked it.  It's a keeper!

This was super easy and turned out really well. I agree that the sauce could use a little more richness - maybe just some extra salt. Otherwise it's a nice flavor.   I started with 2 frozen pork loins cut in half and used a whole can of regular chicken broth instead of condensed. Next time I'll try the condensed. I thickened the sauce like suggested and it made a nice gravy for topping over rice.

I did a dry rub on the pork first with mustard powder, salt & pepper, a little onion powder, and a little garlic powder.  I then browned it with olive oil in a pan and rubbed a little dijon mustard on it before placing it in the crock pot.  Instead of just chicken broth, I mixed in a little bit of beer too (for around 1/2 cup liquid total).  And, like others, I sliced the onions instead of chopping them.  The pork practically fell apart!  It was delicious!  My husband wouldn't stop raving about the sauce and we had a lot left over!  Next time I'd probably use 2 onions, since they disappeared all too quickly.  But I'll definitely make this again.

The leftovers were even better!  I used mustard powder instead of Dijon and a pork tenderloin.  The meat was falling apart after 4 hours on high in crock pot.  Delicious for whole family!

Disappointing, I added canned apricots at the last little bit of cooking. Comments were that it was dry & my little ones just picked at it. Oh well.

This was very good and very easy to make. I've never cooked a pork roast before so I was surprised at how tender it really was. I could barely pick it up out of the crockpot without it falling apart. I could not find condensed chicken broth, so I just bought regular chicken broth and used the whole can. The only kind of criticism I have is that my roast was only about 2lbs and even using a whole jar of apricot preserves, the flavor was not as strong or sweet as I would have expected. Did anyone else run into that? If so, do you think using a 2nd jar of preserves would be ok? I will definitely make this again!

my family loved this!  A nice change.  I did cut back on the chicken broth to about 1/2 cup and found the consistency to be good.

Sounds really good. Might I make one suggestion tho. Instead of cornstarch try arrowroot. It doesn't have that pastie taste.

I made this for dinner last night.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  I thought it would have a glaze, but instead it made a very thin and not very flavorful sauce.  I tried thickening it with some cornstarch but it really didn't take shape.  I cooked it on low in the crock pot for 8 hours and it was a tad dry but so soft that it fell apart.  I'm going to shred the rest of it and add BBQ sauce to make sandwiches.

Pretty good, I just used the recipe to cook it like a normal dinner.  Good flavors, next time I will plan to make this as intended in the slow cooker.

I have a variation of this recipe which I found in a slow cooker cookbook, except that it calls for just a 1/4 cup of chicken broth, which I usually make from chicken bouillon that I have on hand. The roast turns out tender and flavorful and it's a breeze to prepare.

I made this pretty much by the recipe but I added a garlic clove, salt, and pepper. My roast was bone in and it worked out fine. I had to skim the fat off the top. It was much better day two. Served with smashed potatoes and green beens.

I thought it was awesome.  Thank you.  Added some dried cranberries, a little white wine to the recipe and only used about 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Also seasoned meat with salt, pepper, garlic and seared in pan before putting in crock pot. Served with brown rice.  Will have again!

I was amazed at how delicious this recipe came out of the slow cooker and so was my husband who couldn't get enough of it.  I, too, had to stop myself from overeatting.  We are looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow night.  I would definitely recommend everyone to try this Apricot Glazed Pork Roast in the slow cooker.

Very quick and easy.  The meat comes out very tender and just falls apart.  I don't recommend trying to slice it, just shred it.  AND MAKE THE GRAVY.  OMG make the gravy!  It was fantastic.

The preserves and other ingredients made a coating (glaze)  that was excellent. This version was what the crockpot does - meat with a lot of liquid around it.  Everything tasted okay but it didn't really have that "glaze" I was hoping for. I will try again and follow the suggestions on the bottom for a thicker liquid or try sahm2nick suggestions - cooking meat first and adding onion soup mix - which is what my oven recipe called for as well.

Made this per the instructions and it was great. Next I tried it with boneless chicken, then bone in chicken, porkchops, pork ribs, beef roast, and venison, as well as sausage links. Was always good and my family really liked it as did I. Only thing is I didn't have apricot jam for some of these so used some of the ton of apple jelly I made last year and it was still good. Could probably use peach jelly too.

First rubbed the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides, then browned on all sides in a skillet with 2 Tbsp. olive oil. Added a bag of dried apricots to sauce, half I cut up and the other left whole. Then followed the directions. Wow the roasted came out perfect,
moist and juicy. The flavors work well together.9/10/14 Today I added 1 teaspoon of ginger. I know ginger goes with pork. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I made this for dinner tonight, pretty much followed the recipe except that I browned it first after sprinkling it with salt, pepper and onion salt.  I also threw in some dried cranberries, because I throw them into just about anything I can.  It smelled heavenly and my husband loved it, but I didn't think it tasted as good as it smelled, so that's why I gave it the four stars.  Still, a very easy recipe, I love fruity sauces with pork, so this worked for me.  Also, as for those who said it was dry, we have a 2-1/2 quart slow cooker which, unfortunately, Rival doesn't make anymore, and which I've told my husband I want to have buried with me.  So a 2 lb. roast fits perfectly in there and cooks in a lot of juice, so I didn't have a problem with the roast drying out.  So make sure your crock pot isn't too big for your piece of meat or your roast won't be as juicy.  Pork is tricky enough as it is, so I hope this helps!

I normally shy away from any recipe from a company, but this was really good. I followed the suggestions of another member and omitted the chicken broth, added a Tb of onion soup mix, and browned the tenderloin with salt, black pepper, and garlic. I also, cut the preserves in half. This had a wonderful savory flavor.

Amazing!!! I only did a four serving amount of this...a 2lb pork loin roast, 1/2 jar sugar free apricot preserves and 8 oz of chicken stock. I salt and peppered the pork also added some onion powder instead of onions (my husband hates them!) and added a tsp of dried thyme. I drizzled honey over the pork and cooked in the crock pot. It was savory and simply delicious!!! Thank  you for the recipe!!
