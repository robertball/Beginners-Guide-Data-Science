OMG!!!! Please try this, people! the only change i made was using white wine (sauvg blanc) instead of vinegar, and i omitted the parsely.  everything else i doubled (well, except the hotsauce & cayenne b/c of the hubs taste preferences. me, i'd of loved a kick but i love the man more...) then realized i needed more marinade due to the amount of fish i had (1.50 pounds) so i doubled again. marinaded the swordfish for just over 90 minutes and OH. MY. GAWD!!  i personally could not stop raving about how delicious the flavor was even though i was the host. but everyone else was raving as well so i was only joining the chorus. truly the best swordfish i have ever, ever had.

I tried this tonight with swordfish steaks from Trader Joes and marinated them for about 2 hours.  I added 4 cloves of garlic I had 4 steaks, and also upped all of the spices by 1/2 of what was called for.  These were extremely tasty and tender!  It was a hit with the family, the flavors all came together perfectly and gave the fish a taste that wasn't over powering on anything.  I'll keep this for quick weeknight dinners as what I was looking for tonight for a long time.  I'm so surprised this doesn't have more ratings, it's not always about the ratings, it's about the ingredients and if they fit your likes!!!

Absolutely fantastic - the best fish dish I have had in quite a while. I had to make some substitutions, though: (a)didn't have lime, so used lemon juice instead (my wife doesn't like lime anyway), (b) didn't have white wine vinegar, used white cooking wine, (c) didn't have ground ginger, used fresh chopped ginger, about 2 teaspoon, (d) didn't have hot pepper souce, used more cayenne - maybe 1 teaspoon, (e) didn't have thyme, used marjoram instead. This last change worried me a little bit, as the two herbs are quite different - but it worked out quite well. Next time, I am going to eliminate ginger (it seemed to be unnecessary) and maybe increase pepper/cayenne to add more zing to it.

Best swordfish recipe I've ever used...I was skeptical at first, but the flavors came together just right.  I added garlic to the marinade and omitted the salt just for preference.  Will be using this recipe again.

Used this recipe over mahi-mahi and it was delicious! Substituted olive oil for veggie and red wine vinegar for white - my husband and I LOVED it! Will definitely be making this again - thanks for the recipe!

Very good marinade.  Only comment is that the lime juice is a very dominant flavor.  I will definately use again, but will reduce the amount a little so it isn't as strong.  (only marinated it for 30 minutes).  Thanks for the post.

This was a terrific surprise!  When it comes to fish, my family is all over the map with likes and dislikes.  Whenever I make a new recipe, it is always a gamble.  I made this exactly as written, but for 4 servings.  I only had enough time to marinate it for about 2 hours.  I grilled it on the George Foreman. EVERYONE loved it.  There was a small bit left over that I threw in a tossed salad for my lunch the next day. It was delicious. This is a permanent addition to my "go to" fish file with no changes made.

This just did not work for us.  The recipe stated to marinate for at least 10 minutes and preferably up to 3 hours.   I marinated about 2 hours and when I took the fish out to cook the lime juice had starting "cooking" the outside of the fish (like a ceviche).   Once I cooked it the outside ended up a little tough and had a too strong lime/vinegar taste.  I won't make this again.

I wasn't too impressed, but it may just be that i'm not a fan of swordfish. The flavors went together better than i anticipated, and i let it marinate a full 3 hours, but the tang of the lime and white wine vinegar were almost overwhelming. I will try it again, only marinating an hour and a half or so and adding a couple of teaspoons of honey. i think the sweetness would add a little more complxity to the tang and heat. I'll update when i try it next.

I hadn’t cooked any sword fish for years.  I knew the place to find the proper way to prepare it though. I was not disappointed it is an excellent marinade and the directions for broiling provided me with an excellent meal. Thank you !

Outstanding marinade! The fish turned out juicy and flavorful. After reading others' reviews, I used white wine, lemon juice and ended up doubling the amounts of the spices. Marinaded in the fridge for 30 mins, turning once. Will definitely make this again!

Yummy. I used all fresh herbs that I had, xcept the ginger, didn't use any of that. Was sceptical about this recipe, all those herbs. It was amazing. Use extra fresh basil if you can, tastes great with the fish!

Maybe I just don't like swordfish, but this marinade didn't do a thing. I followed the recipe and used 1/4 lb piece of swordfish bought fresh from a fish store in NYC. I let it marinade for about 50 minutes. For some reason, it just tasted very bland at the end.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, although I used lemon juice instead of lime since that was all I had.  Our fish was fresh from the butcher, so I am sure this helped, but the marinade itself was great.  We are adding this into our regular rotation and have already bought lime juice to try next time.

This was absolutely delicious!  The swordfish was tender and tasted great grilled. I used the tip on using white wine instead of white vinegar and didn't have cayenne pepper so I added paprika and used a little extra hot sauce (Texas Pete) and it had a nice, but subtle kick.  I served it with a mango salsa that really complimented the flavors in the marinade.  Yummy!!!

Outstanding! Moist and flavorful. My very picky fiance has now claimed this as his fav fish. I did as well. Used red wine vinegar and lemon, I am sure either way is delicious. Served with butter lettuce salad w/balsamic vinegar dressing and a side of broccoli.

We have made this over & over for nearly a year now.  My husband is a picky eater but loves this one.  I used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce in place of the hot sauce (Asian food aisle).  It adds spice without the vinegar flavor of a lot of hot sauces.

This is super easy and delicious! Go easy on the lemon, as it can quickly overpower the fish. Great, fast marinade.

Made it exactly as I read it and it was delicious, maybe the most moist swordfish I've ever made! I would opt to grill as opposed to broiling (if for no other reason that to get those great grill marks) and perhaps up the heat a tad as I like it hot but wouldn't change anything else...Well done!!

We liked this recipe so much, but I admit I did make a couple of changes.  I substituted white wine for vinegar and omitted the thyme ( I don't care for it).  I marinated my fish for 20 minutes max before grilling.
The flavor was outstanding without being overpowering, the swordfish was tender and moist without the dryness that comes from over marinating (precooking in the marinade).  This recipe will be used often during these summer months.  Thank you OZAHIRU for your good ideas!

One of my go-to summertime recipes. I like to substitute fresh basil for the dried stuff and use about 50% more ginger than the recipe calls for. Use some soaked wood cubes when you're grilling for a great smoky flavor that compliments the lime and ginger perfectly. Top it off with a little sweet mango-tomato salsa when you're done, and you'll have a main course that's sure to impress!

I followed this recipe exactly. It is excellent. I did reserve the marinade, reduce it in a saucepan and add a splash of chardonnay for a sauce to drizzle on the cooked fish.

A perfect recipe for a quick dinner. And the fish even after marinating for 15 minutes has a superb taste!!! I came to an opinion: if people would know that this is how a nice fish taste, they would never want to eat the meat :)

I didn't care much for this but it may have been my fault.  The swordfish I bought was fishy--may have been old.  My daughter, however, loved this.  She loves just about any kind of fish.  So the marinade is awesome...just make sure your swordfish is fresh!!

Loved this recipe!  I was missing a few ingredients, so I improvised - margarita mix in place of lime juice, red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  I mistakenly used rosemary instead of thyme, found the thyme and added it too.  The swordfish marinated overnight and was very tasty.

I used this marinade as the idea for my latest swordfish dinner and it was delicious!  I used white balsamic vinegar which added a really nice flavor, and left out the parsley cause I didn't have it... I also didn't have the hot sauce or the cayenne pepper and so just shook in a healthy amount of red pepper flakes.  Marinated in the fridge for about an hour and then baked at 350 for about 20 minutes.  YUM!!  The fish was slightly underdone in the middle so I left it in the hot dish on the table while we ate our appetizers and by the time we were ready for it it was just PERFECT - tender, hot, and juicy - the way swordfish should be!!

EXCELLENT!!  We really enjoyed this and I marinaded our swordfish for about 3 hours while we were at baseball.  Only small changes I made were not using the parsley (didn't have any) and used fresh ginger instead of dried...yummy!  This had great flavour and the cayenne/hot sauce added a nice spicy tang with the lime juice!  Definite keeper!

Easy to make, excellent flavor- not too overpowering.  I couldn't detect the hot sauce or the cayenne in terms of heat so if you're looking for spicy, up the amount.  I left out the parsley (didn't have any) and used Frank's lime hot sauce.  It complimented the fresh lime nicely.  I cooked the fish on a George Foreman grill for about 3.5 minutes.  It was perfectly flaky.  The Foreman cooking guide recommended 6-8 minutes... that would have been way too long!

This was delicious.  Even I loved it and usually I am very discerning when it comes to stars.  It was moist and savory.  I broiled it a bit longer (two minutes more) on the second side because lately the swordfish recipes I have using leave it a little undone.  This was truly perfect.  Thank you Ozahiru...

Exellent recipe, the fish was very tender.  I combined all ingredients, including the oil, lemon and 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar in a large ziploc bag and marinated 4 hrs.  I brushed the fish with olive oil on the grill.   This will now be my go to recipe for grilled swordfish.  Yummmm.

This truly was an easy recipe!  We had just bought the fish VERY fresh and I marinaded it and my husband grilled it.  We both agreed that it may have been the best swordfish either of us have had!  I didnt have veg. oil, so I used olive oil. Also didn't have lime juice or white wine vinegar, so I used lemon juice and red wine vinegar.

This was easy and delicious!  I substituted mild rice vinegar for white wine vinegar because I didn't have wine vinegar.  I forgot the cayenne pepper but it still came out fine (so don't worry if you don't have it), and I used fresh ginger.  I only marinated for about 20 minutes and it came out perfect.

Excellent recipe. I grilled the fish 5 minutes per side. Really use as much or as little spices as you like. It’s the lime that really tenderizes this dish. I marinated it for one hour.

Updated 4/30/18-I made this again substituting the vinegar with white wine and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder..  Much, much better!  Updating to 4 stars.

 9/17/17 The only change I made was to add garlic powder.  However, I thought that the vinegar  made the dish way too tart, therefore, the 3 stars.  I will make this again but instead of vinegar I'll use white wine like so many others did.

Loved this.  Followed exactly except for the lime juice.  Served with roasted asparagus for the perfect spring meal.

Made this last night. I left out the oil & salt since we are on restricted diets & added some garlic powder & onion powder. I used some frozen swordfish steaks from Trader Joe's. It was wonderful, my boyfriend couldn't stop raving a out how great it was! Definitely worth the try & very simple too.

Absolutely one of the best swordfish steaks I've ever eaten.  Made it with red bliss mashed potatoes and it was a real keeper as is.

My husband and I LOVED this marinade. I subbed olive oil for the veggie, and had to sub chili pepper for the cayenne. Overall it was quite tasty, even after only 30 minutes of marinating. Broiled it for a few minutes longer than 10, and it had a little char that was quite tasty. We'll definitely be making this again - maybe even with fresh ginger. Highly recommended!

I marinated this for 24 hours because we didn't eat it when I originally planned but it turned out great.  I pan-fried it in a nonstick pan.  My husband and I both think it's a winner.  Next time I would up the cayenne for more of a kick.

So good and so easy!  I love lime so I added a little more lime juice and the zest.  Made it with Asian Coconut rice and the combined flavors were AWESOME!  Will definitely be making again.

Used rice vinegar instead of white wine... He said it was ok but not super flavorful. Might not make it again.

This recipe was great! I literally just finished eating and thought I would write my praises on here :)
I would have liked a little more kick, so next time I will double the hot pepper - and maybe try some garlic like another reviewer did.
I also didn't have any thyme or parsley, but it was still fine without them.
Had it with Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil couscous. 
DELISH!

My husband really liked this recipe.  I marinated his swordfish and shrimp in it.  He said the swordfish wasn't spicy.  I might marinade longer next time.  I only had 15 minutes.

This was good.  I didn't have lime so I used lemon.  Got all three of my picky kids to at least try the fish.  Hubby liked it too.

This was really good but if I were to make it again, I would use more lime juice - even after 12 hours of marinading, it was still quite subtle. Nice and easy recipe. Thanks, ozahiru!

This was a great marinade, and I actualyy found swordfish. I think it would be good on other fish as well. I will be trying it.

So-so - but it was very easy to put together.  WE prefer Citrus Swordfish with Citrus Salsa which is on this site - everyone raved about that one!
