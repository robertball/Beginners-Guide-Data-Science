I am an avid cookie baker, and these were good, BUT...the recipes needs about a 1/4 tsp or more of SALT (I tested a few before I added the salt, and the salt helped tremendously). I would also recommend cutting the recipe in half (except the vanilla) because you'll still get about 4 1/2 dozen cookies. Also, don't press them down too much; they'll flatten as they bake.

What a yummy cookie. I added 1tsp of almond flavoring and 1/4tsp extra salt like other reviewers suggested.  I used my pampered chef small cookie scoop to shape the balls so it made the job quick and easy.  I rolled the first batch in white sugar as the recipe called and I could see that it was going to make alot of cookies.  So for the next pan I used cinnamon and sugar mixed together and the next cocoa and sugar.  It made for a nice variety and quite beautiful!  I will be keeping this recipe forever.  Barb in BC Canada

I grew up with these cookies as a family recipe, only the original recipe of my childhood calls for vegetable shortening instead of butter. But butter is so much better! I never thought of using butter till I saw this recipe. The cookies are just awesome. So tender, yet crisp, they really do melt in your mouth. I flatten mine with the bottom of a drinking glass dipped in sugar rather than with a fork. It produces perfectly smooth, gorgeous cookies. These guys are too fragile to frost (if you did manage to spread frosting on without breaking them, they would absorb the moisture from the frosting and turn unappetizingly soggy) but colored sugar sprinkles is an option.

I just finished making these cookies and I had to write a review - they are great! Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. I added 2 tsp. of vanilla and rolled them in white sugar with red and green sprinkles so that they would be festive looking. Thanks for this recipe - it will be my new Christmas tradition!

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted and they really do melt in your mouth! I decided to scale the recipe down to 24 servings and it still made 4 dozen, so I would suggest not making them at full recipe. To make the colored sugar just put a half a cup sugar and a drop or two of food coloring in a ziplock bag and mix it around. It works great. These cookies will get great results no matter where they are served! Thank you for sharing the wonderful recipe.

I used 1.5 cups of butter and 1/2 cup of canola oil since I didn't want a super crispy cookie.  They turned out great with the change, nice and soft with a tiny crunch at the edge.  Perfect for decorating.  Update:  made with one c butter, half cup oil, half cup apple sauce and cut the powdered sugar to one cup sinceiwas going to frost them, and even better. They were almost too sweet with the frosting before

Don't be surprised at the greasy feeling of the dough.  I will chill it next time to make it a little easier to handle.  I forgot to press down with a fork and just
waited for the dough balls to flatten and it was a perfect indication that they
were done.  

I used this recipe for Christmas and rolled a few in red sugar,
a few in green sugar, a few in white sugar and a few in cinnamon and sugar.
I am keeping this recipe. I do wish I had made half a batch.

So good and so easy.  I added almond extract because I love that flavor.  Also colored my sugar before rolling.

These cookies stayed nice an soft.  To the 1/4 C of white sugar I added some colored sugar (pink and purple) to pretty them up for 4 little girls who's mother is on a 6 month deployment.

These are excellent. Very easy to mix with my Kitchenaid and I like the slight shortbread feeling they have. Very yummy! Also, since I used a small scoop, they didn't take very long to get on the cookie sheet. Excellent cookie!

Tasted good and followed instructions excactly, but were very crumbly, esp. a day or two after.  The "Sugar Cookie Icing" I used from this site held them together.

Awesome cookies.  I took others advice and added pinch of salt and an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Used colored sugar on some.. and cinnamon/sugar on others. Everyone loved these cookies, and they are very pretty. These freeze/keep very well. One of my favorite recipes.

This recipie is fantastic. 9 minutes is perfect in my oven to make a cookie with a crisp outside and soft inside. 10 minutes dries the cookie out more and leaves a more crunchy cookie but still very good if you prefer more crunch. This recipie made 8 1/2 dozen for me. I made these and gave them along with other cookies and candy as Christmas gifts and everyone loved them. Made another batch today with almond flavoring and they turned out great.  Adding 1/4 tsp of salt helps to enhance flavor.

Turned out perfectly--I rolled the balls in colored sugar crystals and then used a cookie stamp on them.  Beautiful!  The larger sugar crystals work great, they make the tops and bottoms crunchy and add another texture dimension.

My coworker is allergic to nuts.  So I made these similar to peanut blossom cookies.  I rolled them into balls cooked them and added a hershey kiss in the middle when finished.  Quite delicious.

I have been looking at this recipe for a long time.  I have always made sugar cookies with  just regular sugar, but I was told that to make the best sugar cookie you need to make them using powdered sugar.  I guess they were right.  These ARE the best!!  As others suggested I added 1 tsp of salt.  The next "times" (because there will be many more!)  I will try adding another tsp of vanilla and I will try with almond extract--for a bite more flavor. I refrigerated them overnight to blend flavor & make them easier to handle.  I also flatten the cookie by dipping a glass in water first then sugar.  DELICIOUS delicate cookie!  A definite 5 star recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I took user suggestions and added 1/4 tsp of salt.  Thank you!  We made Red, White, & Blue Sugar for the fourth of July, and they were a huge hit with the whole family!

Light, crispy, buttery - these are the perfect sugar cookie!  When you bite into one of these little treats you will immediately be reminded of the can of Danish Butter cookies that your Mom used to receive as a gift around the holidays.  I used the recipe 'as is' and found it easy and so worth the time.  Use colored sugar to dress them up, and I used a grid-pattern potato masher instead of a fork to compress each round ball of cookie dough.

These cookies are so easy to make and you do get quite a lot!!  I did add 1/4 tsp salt and some cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor.  You can get creative with the decorations if you don't want to roll the balls in sugar again.  After baking, put two together with lots of  jam in the middle for a cookie sandwich!

Wow! These cookies were DELICIOUS! I loved everything about the recipe, except when I cut the recipe in half, I still had to add a 1/2 cup of flour to the mix. But then the cookies were perfect! Thank you so much!

I baked these cookies and I just loved them! Great for a afternoon snack! But I added a little cinnamon to the dough and then I also put some in the sugar that you roll the dough in! They were amazing!

Fantastic sugar cookies! I added the 1/4 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla extract that some people had mentioned. The only other thing I recommend is chilling the dough for a few minutes before placing on cookie sheet so it stiffened up. Baked them for 12 mins. and they are nice and crisp, hardly brown on bottom, and melt-in-your-mouth buttery. Enjoy!

Excellent!  Add a little more butter, flour, and salt. I also used the pulp of 1 vanilla bean instead of extract, and added some white chocolate morsels.  To die for!

I just didn't think these cookies had any flavor.  I'm probably just a traditionalist, but I like my sugar cookies sugary and buttery, and these cookies were neither.  They were much more like tea cookies than regular sugar cookies. I used colored sugar to roll them in and the texture and look of the cookies was wonderful, I was just left wishing for flavor to match.

These were awesome...this coming from someone who is not a sugar cookie fan.  Crisp on the outside and very chewy inside.  I rolled them in white and red sugar for Valentine's treats.  Also added another tsp. of vanilla per other's reviews.  Don't overbake....my number 1 rule for any cookies!

These are pretty much all that I'm looking for in a sugar cookie. Yummy. I added some almond extract too because I love that flavor.

I just finished making these, the last two trays are in the oven...OMG they are so good!! Believe me, I had my doubts when I saw the cup of vegetable oil...?? in a cookie? plus the cup of butter? GO AHEAD, it works!
 
I did add a little salt (about 3/4 tsp. because I was using unsalted butter)

These are exactly what I wanted. I use a ratcheting cookie scoop so shaping was easy. Rolled them in granulated sugar, flattened the tops with a glass dipped in sugar. Some I sprinkled with additional colored sugars and Christmas sprinkles; some I put red and green M & M's on. 

Then slid them in oven, and waited so anxiously. At first nothing..then they puff up slightly, then settle a bit. They smelled heavenly! I never use a timer, just watch them, and waited just until the edges started to lightly brown. Then pulled 'em out. And patiently waited them to cool before tasting. 

That first bite..OH so good! The gentle crunch of the outer part, the just-soft-enough inside..and YES they melt in your mouth! There's hardly anything left to swallow, lol. 

I left some plain because I want to frost them with a buttery confectioner's sugar frosting, then sprinkle with Christmas sprinkles. 

For me, this made about 66 cookies. 

THANK YOU LOIS! :)

Very good. I used a lot more flour than called for. I also used soft whole wheat and arrowroot powder. They are a very nice sugar cookie.

These are good, but something is missing.  I used 2 teaspoons almond extract & added a teaspoon of salt as others suggested.  I skipped rolling them in sugar & added a bag of M&M's.  I flattened them a little with my fingertips.  The texture is melt in your mouth buttery, but I think they may need a tiny bit more salt.

Love these!  Very easy to make and very tasty.  I made a few diffentent kinds just by rolling a few in sugar, chocolate, and/or cinnamon and sugar before baking.  They were perfect little cookies.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe that I have ever used!!! I made one recipe(72 servings) and they were such a hit with my family that I had to make another! The first time I made it I didn't have 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar so I used 1/2 teaspoon instead. The next time I made it I used the full amount and I couldn't tell the difference. I baked the cookies for 9 min. and they were perfect!! Crispy on the outside chewy in the middle. Yum!! I will always use this recipe from now on!!

I made these today and had my dad try one. He said they were delicious. I added the 1/4 tsp of salt as other reviews recommended. I also rolled them in colored sugar for a christmas twist. They are delicious and I will be making these again.

Fabulous recipe! I needed an emergency batch of Christmas cookies (because my 3 and 4 year daughters sneakily ate my origional batch) to give as gifts to some friends. My husband had made arrangements to be at people's houses at specific times and I had about an hour to figure something out. These cookies were very simple and quick to put together. I split the recipe and added 1/8 tsp. salt as suggested. I rolled 1/2 in red sprinkles and the other 1/2 in regular sugar colored with green food coloring. I baked them for 9 minutes and they were great! I think 10 minutes would have been fine too. Wonderful taste and texture! Thanks so much for the recipe- it was a life saver!!

An excellent cookie! Just as the description states, this cookie is crisp and melt-in-your mouth. The texture is wonderful and unique...I've never tried one like it before! The cookies are so delicate, both in taste and texture. They are almost perfect as written. The only change I made was to add 1 tsp. of salt to the dough. I also rolled them in light pink speckled sugar to give them a more interesting appearance. They look really pretty with the sugar coating...it sparkles very nicely and enhances the look and taste of the cookie. I'll definitely be making these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

It was good but I made too many alterations to rate it any higher.  I used 2/3 cup oil (plenty) 1 ts. salt (I used unsalted butter), and 3 ts. vanilla.   With these changes they were really good!  They have a good texture and not too sweet-just right with frosting.  With less oil they were still quite greasy.

I felt like if you baked these long enough to be crispy, they were dry.  I also happened to miss the buttery taste of cookies of this type.  Definitely a personal preference, of course.  I probably won't make these again.

Great cookie Lois.  My son enjoyed these without any icing and my daughter loved hers with store bought vanilla icing.  I used all butter because at the time I made them, I was out of oil.  The cookies turned out very soft and moist and tasted great several days after.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW... SUGAR FREE - ROCKS! I USED THIS FOR A FRUIT TART II RECIEPE SUBSTITUING THE PACKAGE SUGAR COOKIE THEY SUGGEST.  I ADDED A PINCH OF BAKING SOADA AND IT DOES MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FILLING I USED A 1/4 CUP OF MARSHMALLO CREAM, CREAM CHEESE, WHIP CREAM AND SWEETNER THEN TOPPED WITH FRUIT THEN BRUSHED WIHT APRICOT MARMALADE.. WOW... THE BEST LOW SUGAR TREAT I EVER HAD...

Edited to add: 8 months later, as I'm leaving my job, my co-workers mentioned these cookies as one of the memories of my year with them.  They are THAT good!

These cookies are wonderful!  I made minor adjustments, added 1/2 TBSP of Vanilla instead of 1 ts.  I only had 2 cups of all-purpose flour, so I added 2 cups & 2 TBSP of cake flour.  Like always, I line my baking sheet with parchment paper and use a small ice cream scoop to get a perfect size cookie that looks "store bought".  I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar and they were the best tasting snickerdoodles I've had in a long time!!  Delicious, thanks for sharing your recipe!

These turned out pretty good, they were slightly crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside! I did what one of the previous reviewers had suggested and I colored my decorating sugar by combining it in a bag with a few drops of food coloring. Then I rolled the dough balls in the colored sugar! We did pink, blue, green and yellow...it was a rainbow of delicious sugar cookies. Yum!

Yum! very good cookie recipe! I halved the recipe, added oz of cream cheese and white chocolate chips. A great twist to this recipe. If you decide to try this yummy twist and don't want to half the recipe, then, I recommend you use 8 oz of cream cheese.

I have never made a good sugar type cookie and am so glad I tried this recipe. So easy and so good. I added some salt as suggested. Next time I will add zest or try other extracts than vanilla. Just perfect as written with added salt of course. Definitely makes a LOT of cookies.  Thanks for submitting it.

Exactly the type of sugar cookies I was looking for.  Light, buttery, and crispy on the outside.  Followed the recipe exactly but added 1/2 tsp. salt and an additional 4 Tbsp. of flour.  I used crisco vegetable oil.  I refrigerated the dough for about 2 hours before baking.  It makes a large amount.  The next time I will bake 1/2 of the dough and freeze the other 1/2 to bake at a later date.  I used a fork to flatten in both directions to make a crisscross pattern.  I rolled then in white sugar and after flattening I sprinkled with red sugar for Christmas.  Turned out great.

When I made this we were low on vegetable oil, confectioners' sugar, and we had no cream of tartar, and I used self-rising flour, and used no baking powder. I thought the cookies were very cakey, but they did taste good. I also put a tad of cinnamon into them, but I didn't put enough. They were pretty good, but I won't make them again.

Wow, these are really good. As warned, I added some salt. Maybe 1 teaspoon. Next time, I will add almond extract and put an almond in the middle of each cookies before baking. I also added more flour than called for I think (I sort of lost count). They were perfect.

I didn't like them. There was a funny taste....maybe it was the confectioner's sugar? Or maybe the cream of tartar? I don't know. I was very disappointed because I've made way better sugar cookies from other recipes.

I attempted this recipe as written. Everything started just fine, but as I was working on the cookies, the rest of the batch was coming apart. The oil began separating from the rest of dough.   I wasn't impressed with the dough, the taste or final appearance.

These cookies were okay.  I left out the cream of tartar because I didn't have any on hand, so I am not sure what effect that had.  My cookies turned out kind of dry and crumbly, and the taste was nothing special... not very buttery, not very sugary, not vanilla-y... just eh.  I will admit though that I am partial to chewy cookies!

I gave this one 4 stars because I was looking for the soft sugar cookie, and these were very crisp, which wasn't very enticing to me until I decided to dip them in milk!  Then, they were melt in your mouth delish!  I don't think I'll make them again, just because I really want a soft cookie recipe for my Christmas sugar cookies, but if you like a crisp, dippable cookie, this is the one!

I split the recipe for 6 doz. into two batches. I added 1 tsp almond extract to 1/2 the batch and used the full amount of vanilla 1 tsp in the other 1/2. The half with the almond I rolled in sugar and special dark cocoa powder mixed. The vanilla half I used cinnamon sugar on some and colored sugar on the rest. I used unsalted butter so I added a 1/4 tsp salt to each 1/2 batch. Wonderful recipe, easy to make and hard to resist.
The only thing I would do differently next time is cream the sugar with the butter then add the oil. It took a bit more time than it would have otherwise to get the lumps of butter smoothed out. Next time I think I'll try maple or mint flavoring. I used someone's idea to use a glass to press them instead of a fork. Good idea.

I personally hate sugar cookies, and I hate these too. BUUUUUT--- it gets a five because /everyone/ I have "given" one to, at my school, loves them, & it has made me some good buisness. xD c: So high five! They're awesome! Although, I didn't press them down with a fork, and I let them get poofy, and they weren't as crispy as I guess they're supposed to be. Oh! And i put a ton more vanilla. c:

I decided to make cookies and found this recipie and did it. It really worked!! The cookies came out moist and melted in your mouth. The only thing is I kept them in the oven for a few more minutes than it said because they wernet ready. other than that, i have no complaints.

WOW, I had no chips on hand, and no time to chill and roll-- I did a "slightly modified" version of this recipe, and am I ever impressed!!!  FYI-- I will next make the recipe exactly as is & review.  (1) I cut recipe in 1/2 to try (1/2 x all ingred.)
(2) powered sugar x1/2 WOULD have been 3/4 cup;  instead, I used 1/2 cup powdered sugar + 1/4 cup light brown sugar (3) I did NOT cut vanilla extract, leave at 1 teasp.  (4) 1/2 of flour ingred. WOULD be 2 & 1/4 cup, I used 2 & 1/2 cup-- also, I added a "pinch" of salt.  YEAH, I know, I could have submitted a dif. recipe, but that wouldn't be fair.  This dough came out PERFECT!!!  I knew I had better write down a recipe (for once!).  The dough does not stick to the bowl, tray, or hands!!  The dough and cooked cookies taste GREAT !   And, if anyone has kids, this is perfect to separate into portions, add a bit of food color, and let them make their own cookie creations!   I consider this recipe a REAL KEEPER!  Easy, quick, fun AND  delicious!!

Perfect!  Just the right amount of "crisp."  I did add a dash of salt.

Made these last night for my son's St. Patrick's Day party at school.  Rolled them in green sugar and they were a huge hit!  I did add a pinch of sugar as recommended.  Fabulous!

Easy sugar cookies.  I thought the oil might make a really different cookie but it's just a regular cookie.  It makes it on the crisper side but flavor wise it's the same.  Love the prep though, I hate rolling out cookies! :)

Great crispy cookie! I used lemon extract instead. I had to add about 1/4 to 1/2 c more flour as the dough was way too wet to make balls, I didn't measure just added a couple more handfulls til it seemed dense enough to at least maintain a ball shape when I made one. These did spread a little, but not really too bad. They do kind of melt in your mouth, pretty light texture, but not as much as pan de polvo. I rolled some in regular sugar and some in decorator's sparkling sugar sprinkles, on the table sugar ones it just absorbed or melted into the cookie but the ones with the big sprinkles it was crunchy and reminded me of those little sugar topped washboard looking rectangle cookies that come in the danish butter cookie tins. Thanks for sharing these are great and are worth making for events and holidays!

I just made this recipe with my son. Because he has food allergies to milk and egg, we made it with egg substitute and butter flavored Crisco. We also added the salt and almond extract that others reccomended. They are delicious! This is a great recipe because it doesn't call for all butter, so it comes out great with the substitutions. Great for Vegans as well! Really has a crisp outside and a soft, melt-in-your-mouth middle. Thanks for a great recipe!

This cookie is crispy, just like I wanted. Even my mom who doesn't really like cookies said this one is good. The flavor is just nice, but I added a teaspoon more of vanilla to boost the taste.

I thought for sure this would be the best sugar cookie after all of the reviews and ratings.  But it was just OK for me.  Very plain and not sweet enough.  Good if you are making cookie sandwiches with some kind of frosting.  It had a kind of odd taste to it also.  Not sure if that was the baking soda or powder.  I'll keep looking for a sweet soft sugar cookie.

Delicious and easy to make.  I scaled it to 36, but it made 24.  Most other reviewers ended up with more than the recipie said it would make, so I think I came out with less because I overfilled my scooper.  FOR A 36 RECIPIE (meaning you need to double my additions for the full recipie) I ADDED 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp almond extract, and a pinch of salt.  It took 14 minutes but they ended up dry - next time I will add more oil and bake a little less.  I found the best toppings were just plain sugar.  I'll revise this when I try again.

Great Cookie! I used my Kitch/Aid mixer with the whip attach for the first part then switched to dough hook when adding dry ingred. I flattened mine with a small glass and left them semi-thick which transformed into a soft delicious sugar cookie!!

My mother-in-law likes a sugar cookie to be not too sweet and this one fills the bill perfectly. She also has a hard time chewing (denture issues) so when she tells me that they melt in her mouth, I know that they really do! To make them festive, I roll them in colored sugar. I have made these cookies several times---they are easy, the recipe makes a lot, and they disappear quickly at work.

Exactly what it says: crisp cookie that melts in your mouth.  One person asked for the recipe and they were eaten quickly by hungry co-workers.  The only negative is that they're not great looking.  They look like cookies that have too much butter/oil and not enough flour because they do flatten out.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of flour for the remaining dough after I saw what the first batch looked like.  If these cookies were next to other cookies I don't know if they'd be chosen first, but they are yummy.  I'll definitely be keeping this recipe.

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever made!!  My kids and friends loved them.  I didn't use the cream of tarter, but they still came out light and crispy.  I did use 1/2 cup more of the butter than the recipe called for.  I love that butter rich flavor.  Use BUTTER, not margarine. Bake for 8 minutes.  This is a keeper.

very light and tasty, surprising with the oil and butter, not greasy.  Omitied the rolled sugar step and were fine. Dipped them in melted chocolate, even better.  Doubled the recipe and froze in 1 inch balls for later use.  Very good!!!

These were wonderful!!  Like everyone else, I was skeptical about the so very soft dough in the beginning.  I also added 2 tsp vanilla instead of one. I did not have butter and used parkay intead also, I ran out of sugar so I rolled them in powdered sugar before baking ang flattened them with the bottom of a glass.  I put colored sugar sprinkles on them, my kids ate a ton!  Also, I sprinkled cinnamon on the top of a few, those were my favorites! 
Despite my changes, these were still great, will be making them again!!

Finally!  I have been searching for a chewy drop sugar cookie. I have tweaked several recipes trying to come up with a perfect one and this one is great. I didn't even roll into balls, just used a cookie scoop and rolled them in coarse raw sugar, then flattened slightly.  I could barely wait for the 8 minutes to be up.

brought these to work, and everyone raved about them in great detail!!  several very martha stewart-like co-workers asked me for the recipe (and who doesn't have a decent sugar cookie recipe lying around?), they were so impressed!  was very nervous about the very soft consistency of the dough before baking, but the cookies held up wonderfully and the sugar gave a beautiful golden crisp outer layer.  used 1 tsp vanilla and didn't have butter, so substituted fleischmann's, but no problem.  this is my new sugar cookie recipe!!!  thank you so much!!

Absolutely delicious!!! I am a huge sugar cookie fan too. I cut the recipe in half and followed it exactly, other than doubling the vanilla as others suggested. The dough was very easy to work with without refridgerating! These were perfect in my oven in 11 minutes.

This is one of the best cookies I made.  It's very easy to make, but does take time to roll and sugar.  Well worth it.  Theses cookies melt in your mouth and won't last long.

I've used this recipe for about a year now and it's excellent.  I normally cut back just a little on the flour but using the full 4 1/2 cups combined with refrigerating the dough for 24 hours makes this recipe great for cutting out Christmas cookies.

I've looked for a yummy sugar cookie recipe for years. The dough was always too pastey or messy.  This one is outstanding!.  I added 1 tsp. lemon juice for my family's preferences.  It was easy to make and gone in two days. I also drop the pan on my bread board when I take it out of the oven to make the cookie settle faster.  It makes for a chewy cookie.  Don't store this cookie with a piece of bread for freshness, it makes it too moist. But that works great with other cookies.

This cookies are so delicious.  I baked a little longer, so my cookies is very crispy.  Everyone in my family loves these cookies.  Thank you for very delicious recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make with kids.  I found the cooking time to a good bit longer than the 10 minutes indicated (and I was using a convection oven).  I will definately make these again.

This is the best cookie recipe that I have ever tried!! Kids loved them too and they usually prefer choc chip. Not too fragile lots of flavor. The dough has the consistency of a slightly oily play-doh and would be easy to roll for cut out cookies too, esp since they don't change shape much while baking. (still doesn't hold cookie press print tho) Try adding almond flavoring & almonds and roll in powdered sugar after baking for almond cresents (sp?)350* worked for me if you like them chewy cook less time/crispy cook longer.

I made this recipe as written to make blossom cookies with a Hershey kiss for someone who can't eat peanut butter. They turned out great! I cut the recipe in half and it made 33 cookies. I rolled them in colored sugar to have the fun blossom cookie look.

I use a little less flour (i.e. same content, but not compacted into the measuring cup). The first batch I made had too much flour, and didn't flatten well. The second batch was amazing. :)

This recipe is easy to follow and I always have these ingredients on hand. The dough came out so fluffy. I easily used my cookie scoop to plop the 1 inch balls into the wells of a non-stick mini-muffin pan. When I took them out of the oven I indented them. When they cooled I filled them with buttercream icing. Sugar cookies with icing.....YUM!

I just made these cookies and they are fantastic! I added some salt to them, and also rolled some in cinnamon sugar and cocoa/sugar as some reviews suggested. I got more than 100 out of this recipe, so cutting it in half would not be a bad idea. These are amazing and would be great to bring somewhere as a dessert/treat.

Simple and scrumptious.  The cookies are fun to make with your kids.   We rolled the dough in sugar and then flattened with the bottom of a glass coated in sugar.  My son and husband devoured them in less than 24 hours.

With the addition of 1/4 tsp salt I loved these.  They remind me of the big soft sugar cookies (usually frosted) my family loves from the grocery store.  I also like that this recipe makes a metric ton too!

These cookies went over very well with my family. I just made them today. I have 3 little ones, my youngest 2 are autistic (and very picky eaters). So I pleasantly surprised with the joy these cookies brought them when they came downstairs from their nap. Thank you for this recipe!

Do not roll them in the sugar, just sugar the tops. When rolled, they carmelized and were hard to get off the pan and crumbled, disappointing.

Great recipe! After first tray I didn't cook until slightly browned (they were crunchy) and pulled them out at 10 minutes. The outside was crisp but the inside was soft. Perfect cookie! Thanks!

Loved them and so did the 45 kids I made them for!!  A keeper.  I didn't add any additional ingredients as others have suggested, but rolled them in white sugar for decoration and put 2-3 jumbo confetti pieces on the top.  Lovely to look at, tasty to eat!  thank you.

I feel like an absolute idiot.  After reading all the reviews, I thought this would be relatively easy to make, but having done it, not sure where I went wrong.  Once I made the dough, there was absolutely no way i was going to be able to roll it into anything! So I decided to leave it in the fridge for a few hours.  After 2 hours, I could see the dough was a bit more manageable, so I decided to try a batch.  I could sort of make them into balls with the help of 2 spoons, but no way for me to roll them in anything.  Then I place them on the pyrex that I use for all my baking, and they stuck.  Conclusion:  cookie sheets must be something different.  Apart from all these mishaps (I am convinced there is something I missed), the cookies actually taste great!  I am going to leave the dough in the fridge overnight and see if it is more manageable tomorrow!

These are the sugar cookies my dad made for me when I was a kid. And now that I have sons I wanted a recipe I could whip up for them. My youngest son has food allergies and this recipe was PERFECT because the only substitution I needed to make was the eggs. I replaced the 2 eggs with Ener-g egg replacement. They turned out FABULOUS!! I have one happy 4 year old who is limited to what he can eat because of food allergies. THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING!!

These were very good. I made them for the fourth of July. I added red sugar crystals to some of them, blue food die to others, and the white ones were just normal. These are melt in your mouth cookies that I will definitely making them again after the raves I got from everyone

OMG! Yummy! I used 2 egg whites instead of whole egg and cooked them 4 nine minutes instead of 10. Melt in your mouth chewy cookie!

Good cookie! Left out the cream of tartar and then cut the recipe in half since i didn't need that many cookies. I also put a sugar icing on them and they were amazing!!!

These were pretty darned good sugar cookies.  I added a touch of salt and cut the recipe in half like  others had suggested and it was the perfect amount for four people to snack on for a couple of days

They were good, and a very easy way to make pretty cookies.  i rolled mine in fall colored sprinkles, and they came out beautiful.  It might not be my favorite sugar cookie, but they were good.

This is a great sugar cookie recipe that makes delicious drop cookies and descent rolled sugar cookies too.  I also added about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the recipe then I chilled it over night and roll it out and made cut-out sugar cookies and then drop cookies out of the left over dough from the cut pieces.  Instead of rolling them in the sugar I ice them with the Sugar Cookie Glaze recipe on this website and decorate or sprinkle with sugar as desired.  They are beautiful and delicious.  The sugar cookie glaze makes a really pretty shiny cookie and with a touch of vanilla or lemon juice in place of some of the water the glaze tastes delicious too.  I love this website.  Thank you allrecipes and all that submit and share.

These were fantastic!! My 2 and 4 year old helped, and the almost instant gratification was wonderful for them.  So easy, rolled in colored sugar and they loved it. Dough was a little greasy, but will follow a suggestion and refridg. it alittle next time.  Also scaled way back to 18 servings to try the recipe, but it is a keeper!

scale down to 36 for 3 dozon

These are the best sugar cookie I've ate. I make them for every holiday. All I change is the 1/2 cup white sugar for decoration. I use colored sugars to go with each holiday.

Looking for a crispy, shortbready cookie this is it.  Add 1/4 tsp salt and double vanilla.  Not a soft sugar cookie.

My pre-teen daughter LOVES these cookies, the recipe is easy enough she makes them on her own.  Since they aren't roll out cookies it makes much less mess.  She covered the top of the cookies in a variety of sprinkles so they were festive for Christmas.

These cookies kind of remind me of the consistency of the pecan sandies that you buy in the store.  They are kind of crumbly and they are pretty good.  They were just a little plain for me so I experimented with chocolate chips, mint flavoring, and almond flavoring. The almond flavoring did the trick and they added just enough flavor.

I have been making cookies for two weeks now, looking for one my husband really likes.  This is the one. ;)  I followed the recipe except I was out of butter so I used light margarine and I rolled them in Sugar In The Raw.  These were so crisp and light.  I don't usually like crispy cookies but these are an exception.  
Thank you Miss Lois.

I made these cookies last week for work and the raves are stilling coming in.  I had a gentlemen who was a guest stop in my office yesterday and said these were the best sugar cookies he has had since he was young.  I made them exactly as the recipe read.  I did make them smaller as I needed a lot of them.  This is definitely a keeper.

These were okay.  My husband didn't really like them so we will probably end up tossing them out or giving them to his mom.  I only baked half of the dough though and put the rest in the fridge. So tomorrow I'll probably finish baking them.  Maybe it was some of my ingredients, like maybe I needed a different brand or something.

It makes a light-tasting cookie for when you're looking for something not too rich - a great accompaniment to ice cream or other cream desserts.

This cookie has a very good texture after baking, and the dough was easy to mix and roll, but I have to say the flavor was not stellar.  Overall it was quality, though!

My dough was pretty wet, so I refrigerated it for about an hour.  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla rather than 1.  I do this in all my recipes because I really like vanilla.  I used real butter and real vanilla extract.  I have a hot oven but I needed to bake these about 11 minutes.  The cookies were great.  My kids ate them up!

These were so good!  I didn't bother to roll them in balls-just dropped them on the cookie sheet.  I also added more vanilla for extra flavor.  I will be making these again soon.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried...and believe me, I've been searching!! The cookie truly does melt in your mouth. I had read the other reviews that the cookie didn't spread too much, and put too many cookies on the pan the first time. They all crowded together. I would give about an inch between each cookie to avoid this. But definitely, TRY this recipe! I will use this as my only sugar cookie recipe from now on.

I had a hankering for sugar cookies and made this one night. The only issue is, I realized I had no cream of tartar. I looked through the reviews trying to see if someone else had this issue. But I just went ahead and made them anyway. They’re perfect. Perfectly soft, buttery, sugary. Delicious! I added the salt like others suggested and, as I stated, followed the recipe exactly minus the cream of tartar. My only thing is...I didn’t have the hindsight to think of just HOW MUCH dough this would make. lol. it’s a lot! Delicious tho!!

Very good.  I turned /2 of the batch into sicker doodle cookies by adding cinnamon to the sugar, before rolling them prior to baking.

I rolled in cinnamon and sugar before baking and did not press down to make snicker doodles. Very tender and tasty!

Easy to make lots of cookies! From someone’s reviews, I added 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp almond extract. Decorated with Christmas color sprinkles and cinnamon sugar.  It came out very well and delicious! Definitely I will bake this recipe again!

These were pretty good.  I had an old recipes that was very similar - the cream of tartar makes these cookies very light and flaky.  I like to add lemon or orange zest and extract for a bit of a different flavor.

I have made these every year for the holidays and I absolutely adore them. I’m not a huge fan of baking EXCEPT at Christmas. These always turn out absolutely delicious!! I don’t make any changes to the recipe and love them as they are.

Delicious!  These are by far the best sugar cookies I've ever made.  I did add the 1/4 tsp salt but other than that followed the recipe as written.  

The dough is quite soft.  I added a couple more tbsp. flour because it didn't say to chill the dough.  Next time I'll chill.

I like these pressed quite thin before cooking.  They don't get hard -- they are crisp but quite tender.

I won't make these again...they began to dry out as quickly as I could make them. The flavor was not very strong even though I put a pinch of sugar on top of each and a sprinkling of Pink sugar as well. Sorry but time is precious and I love baking so the recipe has got to be worth my time, effort and ingredients.

We ran out of butter so we used some vegetable oil in its place but other than that, we followed the recipe. My kids made the cookies themselves and they were the most delicious sugar cookies I've ever had! I hate sugar cookies but I love these!

I made these exactly according to the recipe.  The dough was easy to work with, but unfortunately, they just had no taste.  I like a chewy sugar cookie with lots of sugar flavor.  These came out like a tasteless biscuit.

I was looking for an easier way to make candy cane cookies (which are my favorite). I made this as is but added peppermint and a teeny bit of almond flavoring. I also added crushed candy canes to the rolling sugar. They are delicious!! The dough threw me off a bit because it was really soft. I was chatting while baking and thought I lost count with the flour and didn't add enough but the came out perfectly. Definitely adding this to the annual Christmas cookie list.

They are  fantastic !  I did add 2 teaspoons of maple syrup and some Reese peanut  butter  chips,  and after rolling  them in sugar ,  and a little  flating  with a fork I sprinkled  some Christmas  sugar  on them .  Yes ,  I  found  I needed  to  add more flour , no big deal .  I got almost 5 dozen  big chewy  cookies !  Thanks  for  the  recipe ! !

These were  very easy to make and very good!  My husband loved them!  I only made half the recipe since it makes a lot.  I used the full amount of vanilla and added 1/2 tsp of salt per suggestions.  I rolled some of them in cinnamon and sugar to have a different variety.  I think these would be good drizzled with sugar icing over top of them.  Overall, they made some nice cookies.  Thank you for the recipe!  UPDATE - these made great leftovers, they stayed soft for days!

My girls and I loved this cookie!  We didn't use jam because the girls wanted to fill the cookies with icing.  We pressed the dough down with a teaspoon before baking, but the hole filled in during baking so we had to press them again afterwards.  Maybe refrigerating the dough would have helped.   

This cookie was fantastic and it will probably be our new go to vanilla cookie.

5-20-2016  ~These were okay I guess, and certainly edible, but not worthy of  AR's definition of a 3-star rating; and I expect more from a cookie than it being just” okay,” or “edible.”  The dough was nice, tho’ I chilled it a good long while before rolling it into balls so that it was easy to handle.  The cookies baked nicely too, pretty and round.  Even the texture was just fine, a little “sandy” because of the powdered sugar/oil/cream of tartar combination, and I typically like that. But unfortunately the cookie tasted like oil, it wasn’t sweet enough, and it was oddly lacking in flavor.  Even half a recipe produced a lot of cookies, and in this case much more than I know we’ll ever eat.

I like the cookies. I added a bit of lemon flavor as well. 

I did make a mistake in first making the cookies too large and then too much of them. I ended up over baking them :( I would suggest to start at 8 mins...it also really depends on you oven.

The second batch I also made less and I used a tablespoon to get equal sized cookies and to not use too much dough. I then put them in the freezing. Which I believed helped. I had them in the oven for 8 mins and took them out. They are what the reviews are saying, soft inside and crunchy outside.

The first batch did flatten out a lot too. I am mad at myself because I wasted most of the dough :( They would have been fine had I taken them out sooner. 
Learn from me and only make a few at first!!! I also changed the recipe to 40 cookies because I did not want to waste anything if I hated the cookies. I am just disappointed in myself...I usually always do a test batch :(

Adding different toppings for a seasonal touch topped a really good cookie off nicely. My son loved the peppermint crunch top.  Orange and choc chip is a seasonal flavor fav too.  Delicious with a sprinkle of confectioners sugar.

Amazing!!! So crispy and buttery! Made a half batch- still a lot of cookies. As others suggested, I doubled the vanilla and added 1/8 tsp salt (would be 1/4 tsp for full batch).  Will consider almond extract next time!

My absolute favorite sugar cookie recipe.  These cookies melt in your mouth.  The dough should be chilled for a while before rolling into balls so it is easier to handle.

I cant figure out why Im not a fan of these cookies. Its not that they are terrible but just not as good as the sugar cookies Ive made before. And now I have soooo many of them. I guess thats how we find out the recipes we like. Trial and error.

This recipe is totally awesome.  I didn't have cream of tartar so I substituted it with baking powder instead.

My boys and husband love these cookies and have asked me to make them for Christmas 3 years in a row.  I did add salt 1/2 tsp as per many other baker's suggestions and I chose to cut the flour down to 4 cups as I didn't want the cookies to be to dry.  Otherwise I keep everything else the same.  Super Yummy!

It's more expensive, but I LOVE making these with hazelnut oil instead of vegetable oil for a special treat. My family loves it, and I always get compliments on these super-simple cookies.

This has been my husband's favorite cookie since his mom found the recipe 60 years ago. Hers has more vanilla and adds the salt suggested by reviewers. We also bake a little hotter (she likes 375 I sometimes go as high as 400 to get results at high altitude)
The large batch size is NOT a problem in my house. If there are any left after the 2nd day the crumbs make a nice fruit topping, but that doesn't happen often. These are too tender to make lunch box cookies but packed carefully you can travel them to carry-ins. You won't have to worry about getting them home.

This is the best Sugar cookie recipe. They are exactly as said. Cripsy on the outside. Melt in your mouth. Made exactly 4 1/2 Dozen. You do need to flattten them, if you want a flat cookie for decoratiing.

These are fantastic! Probably the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever tried. I made this exactly to the directions, except I did toss in a little extra flour, maybe a couple tablespoons, because it looked just a tad sticky. I used canola oil as the vegetable oil. The cookies turned out just perfect - not too sweet, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and they melt-in-your mouth! I used a baking stone and cooked the first batch for 10 minutes and subsequent batches for nine, and they were just right!

I took them to a group event and they were gobbled right up, many coming back for 2nds or even 3rds!

I loved this recipe.  I added the salt, and almond flavoring that others had suggested, and they were wonderful!  It makes A LOT, but too many cookies is not a bad problem to have ;)  Thanks for the recipe!!

Cookies were very moist and melted in my mouth!!!  They stayed nice and soft for as long as they lived.  I loved the size of the batch for gift giving, but if you are looking for some cookies for you to eat at the house...halve the recipe...it makes a bunch!!

WONDERFUL!  You have all the ingredients at home almost all the and you just through the ingredients together and roll in the sugar.  Everyone in my family loves them and you don't have to put any icing on or anything to make them taste good!  This is a deffinate keeper!

It was really good but with the servings it takes a really long time to bake them all.  But the actual recipe was really good.

this was really good.  i halfed the recipe and ended up adding another 1/4 tsp of vanilla.  I also added a couple more spoonfuls of flour and did not smash the cookie with a fork because i like thick cookies.  my picky husband loved them.  next time i try it with almond extra.

I agree with everyone. This is the best recipe that I have found for sugar cookies. Very easy and quick to make. Next time I will try them with peppermint axtract and crushed peppermint for a different taste. Thanks Lois for a great recipe to add to my collection.

The first time I tried these cookies won me over.  I took them to work(about 60 cookies) and they loved them.  I had to make another batch the very next night.  My kids can't get enough of them and my husband has ordered 6 dozen for his Christmas party.  I tried them with lemon extract amd almond extract just to change it a bit and they were GREAT!
