Had to tweak the recipe a little bit, based on what I had at home. Used whole wheat flour instead of spelt flour. Grounded my oats into oat flour. Used rice milk instead of soy milk. Didn't add blueberries. Loved the taste and texture of these! Will definitely be using this recipe again!!!

I like to make these for myself and put them in the freezer so I can eat them throughout the month!However I am not a vegan so I substituted regular milk for soy milk and they turned out great!Be sure to use BAKING POWDER and NOT BAKING SODA they will turn out very salty and your pancakes will not rise.Thanks for the recipe bonlav!

prepared this mix today and it is great!!! I tweaked it a little by substituting the spelt flour for organic pastry flour, soy milk with unsweetened vanilla almond milk, the agave with organic raw honey. there was enough to freeze for lunch next week. I also made a small amount with the spelt which was great also. The flours were sifted twice also. please follow the resting time it might look soupy when its mixed but it thickens up!!!

I used almond milk instead of soy and added vegan chocolate chips for my little ones. Thanks for sharing.

Made it, ate it and love it. I made without blueberries as well. Very nice and hardy breakfast.
