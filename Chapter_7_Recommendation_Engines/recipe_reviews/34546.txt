I just loved this, the dressing in particular. I thought it might be a little heavy on the cilantro but it wasn't for me, although it was a little much for Hubs.  I made the dressing following the recipe exactly and would do so again.  For the salad itself, I would have appreciated the addition of corn which I had intended to do and forgot.  I used shredded Cheddar cheese rather than the Parmesan because I felt it was a better match for this salad. Instead of crushed or whole tortilla chips I used tortilla strips specifically made for soups and salads. This salad has all the Southwest flavors I enjoy, right in one bowl. It's colorful, crunchy, festive, refreshing, nutritious and delicious.

I loved this but I changed a couple things.  I cut the chicken into chunks and then cooked it in the salad dressing mix.  Then I used 1/2 BBQ sauce and 1/2 Ranch dressing mixed together for the dressing.  I fed my parents and my husband and they all loved it!

This is a great salad, I made a couple of changes/amendments - I could not buy any fresh limes so I used Real Lime juice in the bottle, worked well but I think that fresh limes would have made it even better.  I only used half the black beans. The biggest change that I did was that I made double the amount of salad dressing and I used half of it to marinate the chicken tenderloins for approx. 1 hour.  This really made them so tasty and I believe added to the overall flavor of the salad.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow this was excellent!!  I added more cilantro, because i love lots! I added some olives and some more lettuce, because i was making for more people. I don't eat chips so I baked some whole grain tortillas with some seasonings till cruchy and put those on it. Very good if you are on the south beach diet!!

I just made this recipe  and it was SO good. I used a Mexican cheese blend instead of parmesan cheese. I also marinated the chicken in the dressing and baked it, which made it very tasty. (I recommend making more dressing too.)

Delicious!!! Will definately be making this again. It's a very light and refreshing salad. I didn't have any cilantro so that's the only thing I left out. I also added a little garlic salt to the dressing. I seasoned a couple of thin chicken breasts with garlic salt, chile powder and cumin. I baked it for 20 min. at 350. I cut the chicken into slices and it was sooo good. The flavor went perfect with the salad. I left out the tortilla chips and cheese to make it healthier. My husband kept raving about it too. It's a keeper! Thank you for the great recipe!!!

This was a hit at dinner. Added a little more lime juice and sea salt. I added some corn as well. Next time I will add olives & red peppers.

I used Gardein Chick'n with just a couple of other changes and this recipe was SO GOOD. I changed the 1/4 cup of oil to only a couple tablespoons, omitted the Parmesan cheese, and used fresh lettuce from the backyard instead of the romaine. The seasonings were fabulous and it turned out wonderfully. Thanks!

Southwest Chicken Salad I Haiku: "The dressing MAKES this. This salad was so awesome! (I made small changes.)" Couldn't have been more delighted w/ this salad! For a dinner-salad, I prefer something hot on top, so I warmed my pre-cooked and shredded chicken in a skillet w/ "Taco Seasoning I" and a little water. I also passed on Parmesan (these flavors didn't seem to jive w/ Parm) and used a Mexi-blend of cheese instead. Otherwise, I kept everything else the same, and devoured this. Next time, I'll "marinate" the beans, onion, and tomato in half of the dressing to absorb more of its awesomeness, and save the rest of the dressing for drizzling on top.

I really enjoyed this salad.  I made it the first time as is and felt the lime flavor was a little strong for my taste.  

I doubled the recipe and marinated the chicken overnight using half the dressing, as other users suggested.  I also used less lime juice ( a little more than 1/4 cup because I doubled the recipe).  I used about 3 cloves of garlic and more cilantro than called for - we love garlic and cilantro.  I added corn and avocado to the salad, but I think I will cut the avocado, the parm cheese, and the chips next time to have a slightly healthier version of this salad.  It has enough flavor on its own and is pretty substantial with the beans, added corn, and chicken.

Tasty!  I made the salad dressing the night before. Increased the amount by half so I could marinate the chicken breast tenders overnight before grilling them on the stove in a grill pan.  To give the dressing a little more kick, I cut the chili powder in half and added chipolte pepper . Added some corn leftover from corn on the cob and left out the chips and Parmesan b/c I didn't think the salad needed it.  All of my guests loved it!

This salad is so good!  I cut up strips of corn tortilla and fried them up for the topping.  The dressing is really tasty.  I am planning on making this salad again.

This was just okay for us.  We didn't care for the dressing that much but I think that is just a personal preference.  I marinated the chicken in the dressing as others suggested, and used a mix of romaine and iceberg.

The dressing is the best part.  Very light tasting.  Didn't shred the lettuce or use corn chips and still came out tasting great.

Very good salad.  I made a few changes.  Added cabbage instead of lettuce.  Mixed in with the rest of the salad.  Also added 2 ears of corn on the cob, and 2-3 avacadoes chopped.  Used double to triple amount of garlic.  I love garlic.

I'm giving this 4 stars, just because i thought it tasted good, but it just tasted like a taco to me, and i think its a lot easier to fry up some chicken and/or hamburger and add a packet of taco seasoning mix and add lettuce and cheese and whatever you want, than it is to make the dressing, chop the cilantro, and the onion, etc. It was good, but i won't be making it again, i'd rather make a taco salad.

This wasn't exactly the southwest salad flavor I was expecting, but I loved it nonetheless. The dressing is really good and I like that it has olive oil in it, but I'm more used to a creamy dressing, similar to the barbecue sauce/ranch mix mentioned by another reviewer. Like others, I added avocado, sweet corn, and substituted cheddar cheese for the Parmesan (cheddar seems more "southwestern" than Parmesan cheese to me). The only thing I might do differently next time is add diced jalapenos to the dressing to add a little kick. This time, however, I splashed a bit of Tabasco on top of the salad for a little heat and it was perfect.

This was good.  Hubby thought it was only ok (he's a meat and potato guy).  I did add some fiesta corn with it...hand it on hand and thought it would go well.  Will probably make again for me....but not hubby.  Thanks for the post.

I see many marinate or brine the chicken. Some add or omit certain ingredients. All that is fine. It doesn't change the dish that much to tweak it to your preference. It's about the dressing. I would double it up just because it's awesome and you want to be sure and get enough.

This was very good!  3 out of 5 of my family members really loved it.  2 thought the dressing was too tart . . .next time I might add a little less lime juice, or change something, not sure what.  But otherwise it was very good and a healthy dinner.

Turned out great. Marinated the chicken in chipotle marinade; added chopped cucumbers and avocado.

I followed the recipe for the dressing exactly and really liked it. I would probably double it next time. I used a rotisserie chicken cut up and seasoned it with Tex-mex spices and lime juice. For the salad, I used baby romaine, grape tomatoes, sliced avocado, tex-mex shredded cheese and tortilla strips topped with the chicken and dressing. I will definitely make it again.

We used the dressing as a marinade for chicken fajitas and it was great.

Very good recipe and super simple. I cut up some pork loins that I had left over  and sautéed them in olive oil with salt and pepper. I used avocado, red bell peppers, corn, black beans and chips. The dressing was fabulous as is. Great recipe, thanks!

My family and I really enjoyed this! I mixed the chicken, cheese, beans, onions and the dressing together first, then tossed that into mixed baby greens, since we don't use iceberg. I did add to the chicken mixture 2 avocados, 2 chopped tomatoes, and a few hardy shakes of hot sauce. Then dished it out and topped with crush tortilla chips. Perfect flavor for us, and will definitely make again. Thanks!!

Did not like it at all. I think probably the major problem was not using fresh lime juice.  Anyway, was preparing it for a dinner party and no way would I serve it to my guests.

Yum!! I used the white meat off a rotisserie chicken, just a little diced yellow onion instead of the red rings, and skipped the cilantro because I didn't have any. Excellent! Thank you for sharing.

I made it again, and used diced chicken breast cooked with olive oil and a spice mixture from a friend (salt/pepper/garlic powder). I also switched out the parmesan with grated cheddar this time, and it was still excellent!

This salad is awesome! The only thing I did differently was to make extra dressing and used some of it to marinate the chicken before roasting it. This is now a family favorite.

Outstanding! I doubled the dressing and marinated the chicken in half the dressing for an hour before cooking. I also added a can of corn and used the tri-color tortilla strips. I used shredded mexican cheese rather than parmesan. Everyone loved this salad.

I, too, doubled the dressing and used half to marinate the chicken before cooking.  The taste of the chicken was delicious.  I found the dressing for the salad to be too much of a lime taste.  I added a little sugar and it cut the acid in the lime and gave it a great flavor (I wouldn't suggest adding the sugar if you are marinating the chicken).  I also added some sweet cooked corn to the salad along with black olives.  I will use this recipe again for a healthy salad with lots of flavor.

We had this salad for dinner tonight and my husband went crazy over it and even went back for seconds! The only thing I did differently was add corn, avocado, and used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. The dressing complemented this salad so well! Thank you for the recipe!

We loved the salad!  I  used leftover mesquite marinated chicken.  I might decrease the lime juice in the dressing to 3 Tbl.  next time--and there will definately be a next time!

This makes a great light dinner. My husband and I enjoyed it. Will probably make this again.
