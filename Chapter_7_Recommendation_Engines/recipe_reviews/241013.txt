I don't use tomato paste.  I freeze vegetable trimmings and bones that I would normally discard.  When I get a good amount, I make a broth out of them as described above.   I freeze the broth in an ice cube tray.  When I want to add some broth to a recipe, just pop out an ice cube tray.

Save beef, chicken, pork, lamb bones to Kay this delish nutrient rich broth. I leave the tomato paste out because I use this broth in place of store bought broth in all my recipes. 

Here's another trick. All those pieces and peels of veggies you have when you cook...keep a container in the freezer. Toss the remnants in the container. Every month. Cook yourself up more bone broth. I do mine in a slow cooker for at least 24 hours. The longer it cooks the more concentrated the flavor. Stay away from using cruciferous veggies in the pot. They can leave a weird after taste. Use everything else. I add dried or fresh herbs towards the end. Dried mushrooms and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar for brightness. Totally optional. I let the mixture cool, strain to get the bits out, and then pour into quart or pint mason jars and freeze. Leave about an inch of space between the broth and the jar lid. They keep in the freezer for 6 months. Again, use in place of store bought stock. It is so worth it. Easy clean up with a slow cooker liner. 

You can make it in a stock pot on the stove or in the oven. Low and slow is best. Pressure cooker if you're in a hurry.

Add more water if necessary to keep everything surged if you are cooking on the stove, slow cooker, or oven.

I didn't use the tomato paste but otherwise follow the recipe.  I have read recently that adding about 1/4 cup vinegar to the water and letting the bones sit in it for about half hour before turning on the heat help leach more minerals out of the bones so I always do this now with all my broth.  Always have homemade broth in the freezer, so handy and much cheaper , tastier and healthier than store bought!  Love drinking on it's own, esp during the winter

Good basic ingredient for an onion soup on this website.  I had 4 neck bones, and I rubbed them with tomato paste that comes in a squeeze tube.  The bones were fatty, so the tomato paste sort of slid around.  I was unable to coat the bones, but I clumped the paste  on the bones and it did just fine.  I cooked it in the crock pot less than the 24 hours(about 18), because I was tired of the house smelling like beef soup.  After straining, I had 5 cups of very dark broth (the color of black coffee), which I used in Chef John's American onion soup recipe.  Will make this again.

I made this and used it as a base in beef stew. Beef stew is something I have been making (similar to the way my husband's mom made it) for close to 10 years and I have always felt it was missing something. This was it! when making the stew I added water, only 2 beef boullion, garlic powder, oregano, and pepper and it was great! I may play with seasonings next time but will make this recipe the same! Very good! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this but instead of tomato paste I used a large can of crushed tomatoes then 4 celery ribs 1/2 Of a small  red onion & 1 large carrot.  After all the marrow was gone from bones I took them out. I simmered for more then 24 hours. This took a two day period then added a 16 oz. Bag of mixed frozen veggies. The soup was amazing & loved by all!

Excellent, flavorful broth.  Next time I may add some white wine as part of the water.

I followed the recipe as it was written. Made a very rich broth. I used the beef bones, I personally like beef better. I also pulled out the bay leaf and blended the vegetables and fat left over into a paste consistent. I put into my ice tray to freeze and  will use it when I make any stews. It will add more flavor to my stews.

I didnt follow the recipe exactly but can tell it had a good base to it.  I added a teaspoon of marjoram and a cup of celery. 
 I let everyone salt there own soup for some in our family has health issues and cant have much salt.  I used our electric pressure cooker and timed for 25 minutes.
Our family loved it.

I didn't use tomato paste and added 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, to help leach the bones, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. The broth was good, but is greatly enhanced with salt and pepper, when used.
