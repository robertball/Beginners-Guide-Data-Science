Very good! I dredged the pork chops in onion soup mix and flour, browned them, removed them to my dutch oven, made a roux with the leftover flour, oil in pan and wine, added whole milk and water until it was the right consistency, added 1 tbsp minced garlic and pepper, poured gravy over chops and baked at 250 for 1 hour while making sides, so tender and flavouful.

Loved it! Very easy! I made it pretty much as it is written, but didn't have any heavy cream, so I used milk and added about a tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in a little water to the sauce to thicken it a bit. Also, I didn't add any additional salt because the soup mix is quite salty as is. I served it over rice & it tasted wonderful!

Excellent. I didn't add any salt since the onion soup is really salty to begin with. Since I never have heavy cream on hand, I substituted about half 1% milk and half cream cheese, and once the cream cheese melted it worked really well. This would be gorgeous with chopped scallions on top (if only I'd had some!).  Next time I make it I'll serve it with rice to soak up more of the yummy sauce.

I made this for my boyfriend last night. He called them the 'best pork chops, EVER'. The only changes that I made were that I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream (it was all I had) and I didn't add salt. I fried then simmered the chops on the longer side of what the recipe suggested, as they were bone-in and very thick. They were crispy looking (I don't eat pork) and the sauce reduced nicely. They smelled amazing while they were cooking. I will be making these again and again. Thanks Tina C.!

I really, really wanted to like this recipe, but for me it had some issues.  I make pan gravy a lot so I feel like I know what I'm doing.  I think the 3/4 C of wine may have been a tad to much.  In the end it was the predominant taste in the gravy.  Also, my cream curdled as soon as it hit the pan, which I thought was odd.  Finally the garlic powder never fully incorporated into the gravy.  If I did this again I would use fresh garlic and sub chicken stock for the wine.

Wow!  I made these for dinner last night, using the recipe exactly as written.  My family devoured these pork chops!  They have such a wonderful flavor, and they are really easy to make.  This recipe will certainly be in my regular dinner rotation - no more Shake-n-Bake pork chops in my house!  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

WOW! These are EXCELLENT Pork Chops!  I did take the advice of another reviewer and did everything up to the end of the recipe but then stuck them in my dutch oven and put them into the oven for an hour at 250.  They just feel apart! No knife needed!!!!  Then I made a gravy from the brown bits left in my fry pan by using a little butter to get all the bits up then added some flour, just a teaspoon at a time to thicken.  Then I added some of the same wine in, prob. 3/4 cup and brought to a boil and lastly I turned it to low and added some cream to make a gravy. (Used all the same ingred. of the pork chops besides the garlic for the gravy.  Although I did add some salt and pepper to the gravy.)  These pork chops are truely one of my favorites now!!!!  My son even said it was just like a meal from a fine dining restaurant!!! I will make again and again! Thank You!!

I loved this recipe...loved it! I did change two things about it, I used chicken broth in place of the white wine because I didn't have any and I didn't add no salt because the onion soup packet has deffinately enough. O double the sauce you won't regret it. Served them with mashed potatoes, awesome recipe. Thanks so much Tina:)

Made as the recipe described and everyone raved about the taste.  I did add a pinch of salt but probably didn't need to.  Had rice to soak up the great gravy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish turned out very well although the sauce was a little runny. But we thoroughly enjoyed it anyway! Thanks so very much for an enjoyable meal.

Would make again. Used red wine (cause that's all I had). Will use 2x the wine & cream next time. The onion soup mix made it really salty, so no extra salt is needed & I needed more rice to mix the sauce into to balance all the salt. But this was really easy and yummy.

These pork chops are so good--I make them often!  They always come out so tender.  But, I do make some changes.  I think they are 5 star when I add about 1/4 cup flour to the onion soup mix, and I coat the pork chops in the mixture.  I use all the wine--it's yummy, and I cut the garlic powder in half and don't use any salt.

I made this recipe at the request of one of my 6 yr old triplets (he liked the photo).  It was wonderful.  Even my husband who doesnt like pork chops loved it and had seconds.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was a hit.  Used all the ingredients listed but used my own quantities to make extra gravy/sauce. I also sautéed onions in the same skillet with my 2 pork chops at the same time.  If I had mushrooms on hand, i would have sauteed them in there as well. Left the onions in with the gravy.  It was awesome.  Good recipe.  Will definitely make this again

I felt everything was going along just fine until it was time to make the "gravy" if that's what you wnat to call it.  The cream immediately separated when added to the wine, and I thought this recipe called for too much wine for that matter.  I let the wine come to a boil as the recipe stated, then I turned it down so I don't think it was too hot causing the cream to curdle/separate.  There is NO WAY these measurements could be right.  Maybe I'm missing something here.  Thank goodness I didn't put my porkchops in that mess, otherwise we would have been screwed and had to go out for dinner.  I ended up adding more cream which still didn't help, so I added some McCormick's dry brown gravy mix to it to try and thicken it up.  It did help but it turned a creamy tannish/brown color that did not look appetizing.  I added the garlic powder and other seasonings as the recipe called for and it just didn't help.  The wine flavor just over powered this dish.  I love wine but this just wasn't a good combination.  I was very disappointed with the sauce, but at least we had some tasty pork chops to eat.  I did add a little kosher salt and black pepper to the meat before coating them in the onion soup mix and they turned out great.  I have tried another recipe on this site, similar to this one but it involves cream of mushroom soup, and it is MUCH better.  I'm not sure I would try this again as I have no idea how to make the sauce or "gravy" better.

I used this recipe as it called for and it was a hit with the family. But, the other day, I had some thick pork chops that I wanted to stuff with stuffing and I wanted to add a pizzazz to it. So, I decided to use this recipe. I smoothered the pork chops in the onion mix and fried on both sides, then I cut a slit in the pork chops and put the stuffing in and layed the extra stuffing under the pork chops in the baking pan. Then i satueed mushrooms and then followed the rest of the recipe as is and then poured it over the pork chops and cooked for 35 min on 350deg and it was just awesome. Will do it again. It helped the pork chops from drying out.

Oh my...this is just way too yummy.  Made just as written except didn't add any salt.  Used a iron skillet.  The gravy is the best.  My 10 year old son, who doesn't like any gravy, was scraping the bowl.  One thing...could have used a little more gravy.  Served with steamed brown rice and fresh broccoli.  Bon appetit.

My boyfriend loved it!!  I had to modify the recipe a bit since I didn't have cream or milk or yogurt.  I used sour cream, watered down but not too much to make it soupy.  I also followed the other reviewers advice and didn't add salt.  It was still too salty and next time, I will had more milk or cream.  The recipe did call for ALOT of wine and I, too, scaled that down.  Next time, I will have to try the milk/cream.  The sour cream was really good, with a little extra kick to the flavor, but I would like to taste with the milk/cream.

So good!  I did have to substitute a few ingredients, only b/c of what I had on hand, and it still turned out amazing.  I only had beefy onion soup mix, so I used that.  I used chicken broth instead of the white wine and evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream.  I also had 8 pork chops, so my small packet of beefy onion soup mix only covered about four of them.  The rest I seasoned w/garlic salt, garlic powder and some black pepper.  My family raved.

My girlfriend got tired of all the ethnic dishes I'd been making and kept asking me to make 'country cooking'.  So I found this last week and made it.  I had some issues with cooking the pork chops because I could only cook two at a time, so I had to keep adding oil to the pan and still ended up with some real bad burnt pieces in the sauce.  Other than that, these were awesome.  We had enough for 3 meals and finished them off in two days.  I made this with a great potato salad dish from the site and served them over rice.  I had some issues with the sauce and went a little off track trying to eyeball the wine and cream, but it turned out pretty good.  I'm thinking of making these again tonight and imagine I'll do a little better the second time around.  Keeping this recipe for future use.

EDIT - wanted to throw in that I had 7 pork chops and ended up using 2 bags of onion mix to really get it in there.

Very good. I used two packets of soup mix because it didn't look like the one packet was going to be enough. I also used less wine and half and half instead of heavy cream. Made a nice gravy. Went well with mashed potatoes.

This recipe was wonderful and so much better than expected.  The only change I made was to add a little chicken stock to the sauce and then I simmered the pork chops for about 15 minutes.  I didnt even need a knife to cut them!

I didn't have heavy cream, I substituted 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 1 cup of milk.

I cut recipe down for two. The skillet was a little too hot for initial frying. The onion soup was too salty. May have used too much. My wife loved it. Next time I will lower skillet temp. Very easy and quick meal.

Great tasting sauce. Some ratings said there was too much wine, so I reduced it to 1/2 cup. That was a mistake. I couldn't taste the wine at all. Next time I will follow the recipe's amount. I used cooking Sherry as that is all I had.  I made some changes to suit our taste. After I removed the chops, I added 1 TB butter to the pan. I also added 1 tsp minced garlic, one onion sliced, and 4 ounces fresh mushrooms. I then baked for 1 hr at 300 deg. as we like our chops very tender.  The cream did not separate as  some reviews mentioned.. This is definitely a keeper even without my additions.     ...UPDATE..8-4-2019. I made this again. Since I only used 2 chops, I had onion soup mix left over.  I sprinkled that into the sauce, then put in the oven for 45min at 300deg.  Wow, talk about a great flavor. We love this recipe

Delicious! I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder. Make sure to let it simmer in the sauce on low for 10-15 minutes before serving. I will definitely be making this again!

It was quick, easy, and flavorful. I did try to empty the contents of the dry onion soup mix in a bag and put in the pork chops in an attempt to "shake 'n bake" the seasons onto the chops. It didn't work well. I wound up using both of the 1 ounce packages for the 4 chops, and it didn't coat very evenly. Inspite of this, this recipe was still a huge hit for us 4 incredibly picky eaters!

Very good and easy. I made a few tweaks - used chicken broth in place of wine and sour cream instead of heavy cream. It was delicious but VERY, VERY salty. That was my fault though, I pressed the chops into the onion soup mix instead of sprinkling the mix on. I would absolutely make this again.

I agree with the reviewer who said the "gravy" tasted a lot like the wine.  The gravy never got thick either, even though I cooked and cooked.  This is not my favorite method to prepare pork chops and I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

This was better than I expected. I found this recipe and I had all the ingredients needed.  I only made 2 pork chops, but made the full amount of the sauce. We had cauliflower puree with the chops and used the sauce as gravy over both. It fit in with my low carb plan as well. Thanks!

I liked this recipe because it was easy and fun to cook. I adjusted for two servings but the quantity of onion soup mix was still to salty. I should have omitted any extra  salt. I will definitely try again with adjustments. I served with a nice salad with avacado & tomato.

I will definitely make it again! Delicious and affordable. The changes I made was no added salt and like others had no cream on hand, used 1 tbs flour and 1 tbs flour blended and then added to my 2% milk. So good! My husband and I ate the whole thing. Served over white rice an frozen mixed veggies. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is awesome! Super easy to make. I did dash some lemon pepper. I cooked it a little longer than I probably should have but getting use to the skillet. :)
One thing I'd say is really make sure you give it some cool down time between the wine and the cream.
Added the sauce onto the rice. Delicious!

This is very good. I don't like onion soup mix, so I sautéed fresh onion before dropping the chops in the pan. Do yourself a favor and don't use any salt until the serving table--I added a very little bit of garlic salt and this was WAY salty, even with no soup mix. Thanks; this was very good.

This is very good but be careful of the salt you add. I made a booboo by taking a short cut and added a salt, pepper, garlic seasoning which made it way too salty. I recovered it by adding flour and water making a thicker gravy. My family never noticed my blunder :-)

Made this for dinner tonight after finding it and much to my surprise my husband thought it was delicious. I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and did not add garlic since I don't like it. The sauce is really delicious, I am going to try it in the crock pot with a pork loin.

Very good. I'll lay off the extra salt next time, and maybe even go easy on the soup mix. Overall, these were very good and I liked the sauce a lot!

These are delicious!  My sister in law made these her last visit and I had to have the recipe.  I make these often, they are so quick and easy.  Steamed carrots go great with:)  Both kids (ages 6 & 2) love them

My son and I really liked this recipe. I would not add any additional salt next time as the onion soup mix has plenty.

This recipe was super heavy on the wine.  Next time I would also use half of the onion soup mix.
