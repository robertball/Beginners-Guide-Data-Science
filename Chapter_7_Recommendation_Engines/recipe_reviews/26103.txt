This was so yummy!!!  My husband dislikes chocolate and loves pistachios, so I thought I would give it a try.  He loved it and so did my anti-nut kids.  I will definitely make this again.  I am also thinking that it would be fun to try with crushed candy canes or red hots instead of pistachios.  I think the basic fudge recipe would be versatile.

I gave this 4 stars because the flavor is great-especially for pistachio lovers. However, I had texture problems-which were probably my own fault. I'm not familiar with "candy coating" or where to get it- so I used 8oz vanilla chips, thinking it was close to the same thing. My candy has more the texture of divinity, but I am still enjoying it.

I loved this recipe! Very easy, sets up well and can be adapted to any taste by using other flavorings. A big hit with my family! Thanks for sharing.

One word: taffy.  I'm sure I did something wrong, first attempt at fudge-making, but I now have pan full of pistachio taffy.

Looked good, taste fine but the consistency was disappointing.  Never got hard enough.  If you pick it up between your fingers to eat you would need to be careful not drop some from the middle, you would need napkin to wipe fingers.

Yummy! I used this as the middle layer in a spumoni fudge. I mixed in a cup of powdered sugar to stiffen it up a bit, before adding a top layer of strawberry fudge which I adapted from this recipe.

Nice texture, but it didn't have the pistachio flavor that one would expect from pistachio pudding, for example. Consequently, this is a very nutty fudge and not for everyone. We liked it but didn't love it; I probably won't make it again.
