Very basic tuna salad mix, but once combined with the lettuce and cheese, it works!  I did find the tuna extremely dry (even with using oil-packed tuna), so I ended up using at least double the mayo called for.  It was enough to stuff 2 romaine leaves, so whether it makes 3 servings is up to you. For me it made the perfect sized lunch.
