I made this last night and I love it! Delicious and I love the cashews in this. When I make this again, and I will, I will roast the nuts a little bit before I put them in. Yummy recipe!

I didn't have cream of tartar and used dark corn syrup. This turned out yummy. I ended up just leaving it in bite size chunks. Stored in freezer when I need a taste of something sweet.

It turned out great. Reminds me of Cracker Jack's. Haven't had that since I was a kid!

Making now almost done. Used cashews and pecans. I'll bake slightly longer because I like it crunchy. This is scrumptious on a rainy evening like tonight. Where's my book?
