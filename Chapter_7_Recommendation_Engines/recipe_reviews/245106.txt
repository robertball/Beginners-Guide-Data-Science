I used Pancetta. It always seems silly to me to cook prosciutto. Itâ€™s delicate taste (and high price) are the result of long air-dried curing and meant to be eaten raw. To me, cooking prosciutto reminds me of  chipped beef.

Wonderfully rich taste and the prosciutto was inspiring....a little like bacon but stronger and at the same time more delicate.. I used half of the carrots and celery for the stronger squash and onion taste.
