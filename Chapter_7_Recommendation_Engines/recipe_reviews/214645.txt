My husband said this was really good.  Very moist.  I did not have a 10x14 so a 9x13 worked with extra in a  4x7 pan.  I freeze cranberries in the fall, but needed to empty the freezer so this recipe was great.

I made this two weeks ago for my husband's birthday and he loved it so much he asked me to make it again for his mother's birthday! I put a light lemon glaze on top.
