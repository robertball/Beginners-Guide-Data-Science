If this recipe is meant to be equivalent to Vietnamese Pho, then it is far from it.  It is missing many key ingredients that make Pho really Pho.  To really make this a quick short cut Pho recipe, then just buy the Pho paste at the Asian markets and add it in to give it the Pho flavor.

Made this tonight for my husband and I. I have to say I thought it was an ok dish but my husband just raved over it. I cannot really say why I thought it was just ok, normally I love Asian food and cook lots of Thai, Phillipino and Korean. I think it was just me tonight maybe and not the dish. Anyways, my husband definitely wants me to make it again so thanks for the recipe! PS. use extra cilantro and green onions are recommended!

I would never make my soup base with anything artifical especially with condensed beef broth. I only make my broth with the best ingredients, only from fresh and from scratch.  That's what I call cooking!!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Instead of cutting the steak in really thin slices and cut it in strips and cooked it in the beef broth. I also left out the ginger because I didn't have any. I will try it again and add the ginger next time. This is such a light and refreshing soup.

Tried following the recipe - couldn't find Thai pepper. Used bean sprouts, fresh basil,pepper sauce, lime, green onion - still found it pretty tasteless. Meat, (tenderized top round) was sliced very thin yet still found chewy and slightly undercooked after hot soup poured over it.

Well I normally don't review but this was a great recipe. Easy quick and no slow cooking a beef knuckle. Try it and have fun with adding what you like.
