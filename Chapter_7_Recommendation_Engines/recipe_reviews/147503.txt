I didn't have any pesto sauce so just used a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar with some fresh basil. A nice light summer supper was perfect with a fresh roll and glass of cold white wine.

This was OK--not bad but not great. Instead of using canned tuna I coated fillets with homemade pesto and baked them then mixed the veggies with more pesto and topped the fillets. I liked the veggies with the pesto and the tuna was good; I just didn't love everything together.

This was just OK. I will try another dressing in place of the basil pesto next time. The salad as a stand alone is really good.

Flavors do not mix well.
