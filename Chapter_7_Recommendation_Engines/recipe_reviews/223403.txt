I made this to go with Southern Pork Tenderloin on this site because it was recommended there. I made this using only half of the cayenne because of personal preferences and it was plenty hot enough. My problem with this is that I wanted the flavor to be more complex----the cayenne itself did not do that for me. I love the idea of the mustard but I would maybe try either adding something like ginger to the sauce or use Sambal Oelek for the heat. I'll try it again with modifications. It would certainly be a good thing to have something like this to dip the pork recipe into! Thanks for leading us in this direction. I would not have thought of that on my own.

This was very good and what I was looking for to make with my pork cutlets! I used 1/2 tbsp of the cayenne pepper and could have used 1/4 tbsp instead but still yummy. I will make this again with honey mustard instead.

I like this idea and would never have thought of it. I have pork cutlets and was looking for just the right idea. Thank you!

Oh boy! This was hot! I always check on the prior reviews and I don't know what I was thinking but I didn't this time. I can see this being a good sauce but with half or quarter of the amount of cayenne listed. Live and learn!
