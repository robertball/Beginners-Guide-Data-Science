This was such a great recipe. My 5yr old daughter helped make it with me- couldn't find wheat nuts- used chocolate covered sunflower seeds- that worked great.  Also instead of choc. peanuts- used choc. covered pecans.  We put in decorative glass containers with computer labels and named it as our daughters' "Special Christmas Recipe"- she was so proud-when she gave it to relatives- she would tell people "I made it my ownself- with my own two hands!  Thanks for the recipe- it added alot of fun to the holidays!

Yum! I also used dried cranberries instead of the wheat nuts. In place of chocolate covered peanuts, I found cocoa covered peanuts which provided a nice contrast to the red and green M&Ms. This made a lot. I was able to give away three bags in gift food baskets and still keep a bowl for ourselves. Thanks for the easy, colorful Christmas snack!

I give this 5 stars 'cuz it sounds so good!  The Wheatnuts make it unique...for those of you that can't find them, they are in the snack section of the grocery store, usually on a top shelf, where the Chexmix and stuff like that is...NOT with all of the canned nuts.  If you've never tried them, they aren't actually nut, they have a nut-like flavor and most of the variety of shapes don't remotely resemble a nut!  Make the extra effort to find them. They are addicting and like nothing you've tried before!  I think the additon of Craisins is a great idea and I will add those, as well.  White yogurt coated raisins or white choc. coated mini pretzels would also be a fun & colorful addition!  Thanks for this new & different version of a salty & sweet snack!  I will be giving this away to teachers, neighbors, pastor, friends, etc. and I'm sure my kids will have a blast putting it together and bagging it up for everyone!

I didn't make the mix exactly as written. I used one jar of salted roasted peanuts, two bags of Christmas M & M's, one bag of white chocolate chips, one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a large bag of Craisins. The tartness of the craisins helped cut the sweetness of the candy and the salty peanuts were a nice contrast to the other ingredients. Mixed together, this stuff tastes sooo delicious! And so quick and easy! I put it in Mason jars for teacher gifts as well.

Tasty, easy and everyone enjoyed. Hard to find all the ingredients in the same place. I like to go to one place and get a lot of stuff I need. Great gift idea.

This is a great idea and you can add anything to your liking. I always make something for everyone in my office and it usually cost me about $60 bucks. This is going to be my treat this year. There just happens to be a coupon for $1.00 off M&M's this week so Im printing 3 of them ($3 bucks is 3 bucks right)... Anyway, thanks for sharing & Happy Holidays to everyone!

Used this idea as a Christmas Party DIY Gift Craft for my daughter's 5th grade class.  We didn't use wheat nuts and chocolate-covered peanuts, but added mini-marshmallows, craisins, raisinets, sunflower kernels, frosted cheerios, honey nut cheerios, and cinnamon chex to the list of offerings.  The kids enjoyed making a mix that their gift recipient would like.  They filled cellophane baggies with their customized mix and placed an adhesive gift label on the bag.

I made this last nite & it's excellent. I don't like wheat nuts, so I used craisins, used everything else the same. mixed it up, put it in pretty Christmas jars from the $1 store, what a nice little gift for friends & neighbors. The combination of salty & sweet from the chocolate is excellent.

Giving it four stars am thrilled to have found it! I was loathing the thought of baking cookies (I love to cook, bake - not so much) to give to my neighbors and this has saved me! My son loves to help so this will be a great gift from him!
