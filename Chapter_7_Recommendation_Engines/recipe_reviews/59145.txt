The ratio for the milk and peaches was very good, but I thought it tasted too bland so I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. The vanilla gave it a great flavor! I ended up drinking half of it and freezing the rest in a Popsicle tray. Overall a good concept but it needs some more "oomph."

This recipe was pretty good.  I followed it exactly the first time, then made it again with half milk and half vanilla soy milk, plus more ice.  With the soy milk alone, I felt like it overpowered all the other flavors (but that could be since I'm not too big on soy milk).  But it was still a good recipe =)

I like the taste of the wheat germ and oatmeal in this drink!  I left the skin on the peaches because I wanted more fiber, but will peel them next time!

This was just okay for me. I omitted the oats and wheat germ. Next time, I won't use the nutmeg.It didn't really compliment the peaches.

Mine was a product of trial and error. I knew I wanted to leave out the wheat germ and the oats, and that I didn't have any soy milk. I halved the recipe for my magic bullet, but the measurements seemed off. I ended up adding more peaches and honey, and in the end a little powdered  sugar to attempt to thicken it. If I make this again, I'll use frozen peaches instead of ice.

I really thought this smoothie was delicious! (i did omit the wheat germ, sounded weird to me) But I am on a strict cleansing diet and this smoothie fits in perfectly with it- a nice sweet treat for breakfast...oh I also added pineapple (i had a bag of frozen peaches and pinneapple)

I used frozen freestone peaches so I didn't need the ice and whole milk. I had to add a little vanilla extract to make up for not using vanilla soy milk. Tasty.

I'm not used to "health" food really, so my star rating is based on the fact that I'm used to sugar injected uber rich smoothies. The taste of the oats and wheat germ were quite overpowering for me and the texture was funky, but my boyfriend liked it. I think I'll use frozen peaches next time.

This is a great base recipe for a smoothie when you don't have yogurt! I didn't have peaches, but I had frozen tropical fruit that I used instead, so I omitted the ice cubes. I also didn't have any rolled oats, so I omitted that, too. And I used skim milk instead of the vanilla soy milk. It was great!

I did not have wheat germ or Soy milk.  I used 2% milk and added vanilla syrup.  I used flax seed for the wheat germ.  This was a very good smoothie.  Only gave it 4 because the nutmeg was a bit strong.  Next time maybe just a sprinkle or eliminate it all together.  We will definitely make this again.  I look forward to make this into a popsicle.
