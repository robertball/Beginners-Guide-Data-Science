Stodgy - lose the flour and milk mixture.
Instead, infuse some garlic in heavy cream, and remove.  Melt the gorgonzola in the cream, adding a little white wine to thin if needed.
Add (or not) chopped walnuts to the finished sauce - and that's it!
Take care when buying gorgonzola, as it comes in creamy and extra salty sand pungent. 
In Italy we traditionally use the creamy gorgonzola for this sauce.

What a wonderful base recipe for a quick and easy gorgonzola cream sauce.  Based on the reviews, I improvised a bit. I added a small bulb of garlic to saute with the butter, used half&half to make it richer, 1 and 1/4 cups of gorgonzola cheese, heated long enough to melt most of the cheese, then tossed it with hot tortelloni and topped it off with fresh dungeness crab...it was an excellent meal fit to be served in a restaurant.  My sister who doesn't like gorgonzola or bleu cheese loved this dish!!

This recipe had almost no flavor, except for a very plain white sauce.  We followed the directions exactly and even added a whole cup of gorgonzola, and could not taste the cheese at all. If I would make this again I would only make half the amount of sauce.  Three cups was way too much for one pound of pasta anyways.  If you cut the milk, butter, and flour in half and use 1 cup of cheese I think you might get a nice flavorful sauce then.

Nice mild gorgonzola sauce.  I put extra cheese in because I really like it.  Also used skim milk and it came out fine.

I made this last night and was very disapointed.  3 cups of milk?  that has to be a typo.  It was very runny and I couldn't taste any cheese even after adding twice what it calls for. I have made/eaten gorgonzola sauce in the past and this was not IT.

OMG! This was to die for! My husband and I use to drive 2 hours to go to a restaurant to get a pasta dish with Gorgonzola Sauce. This tastes just like that sauce, now we don't have to drive all that way. Thanks for the recipe.

I found this to be sort of like an enhanced version of the traditional Alfredo sauce. Delicious served over pasta, with some fresh parsley on top.

Wow!  This is fantastic.  The market was out of gorgonzola so I substituted blue cheese.  I added a bit more salt and pepper to bring out the flavors.  I served over tortellini.  My husband said it was definitely worth keeping.

I too added a little more cheese. I guess you can say alot more cheese. I used 1 1/2 cups. And it still needed something else. I think next time i will use a little more salt. I think sea salt and some extra fresh ground black pepper will do the trick. I will make again though.

Delicious. Like many others, I added more cheese and made the sauce with a combination of 2 cups milk and 1 cup heavy cream. I added asparagus, parsley and chives, and used fusilli noodles.

Nice recipe to play with. I added about 1 1/2 tbsp minced garlic which I sauteed in the butter before adding the flour. I increased flour to about 4 tbsp, cut milk to about 2 cups of fat-free milk, and increased the gorgonzola to about 3/4 cup. I also added in 1/2 cup of parmesean and 2 tbsp dried parsley, which was a nice touch, and tossed the sauce with mini bowtie pasta. It was pretty good but would probably use a full cup of the gorgonzola next time. Thanks!

Very good.  However,I agree with cutting the ingrediants in half, but doubling the cheese.  I preferred extra pepper to spice it up, but overall a simple, delicious change of pace. Very easy to put together.  My 13 year old daughter like it too!

3 cups of milk can't possibly be right.  I came out with a really runny soup like result, even after wasting more cheese to try (unsuccessfully) and save it.  I like the suggestion about a garlic infused heavy cream instead of the milk & flour.  That just didn't even begin to work for me unfortunately.

A good base for a delicious sauce! I used an entire block of Gorgonzola when I made it, nearly tripling the original quantity of the cheese but I do like the taste of Gorgonzola. As another reviewer has advised, do not add too much cheese to start if you are not accustomed to the strong flavor of this cheese. I also added five cloves of garlic for added flavor. I didn't have walnuts on hand, but would have added them if I did.  I am a huge fan of strong cheeses and have missed the strong Gorgonzola pasta dishes I ate when I was living in Italy. I recommend pouring this sauce over medium-sized Conchiglie (shell pasta), Gnocchi (soft Italian dumplings filled with potato), or, ideally Trofiette (twisted rag-looking pasta) if you can find it, which is how I usually saw it prepared in Italy!

It's so funny reading everyone's opinions on this recipe- some people think it's perfect, some people think the cheese is too strong, some people complain that they can hardly taste the cheese and add a cup and a half.  Are we all buying different strengths of gorgonzola or something?  In any case, I'm in the "cheese is too strong" camp and only use about 2 tablespoons for the whole recipe.  It turns out perfectly for us that way, quite tasty.  More than that is overpowering to us!  So if you don't know whether or not you love gorgonzola, I suggest adding just a little bit to start.  You can always add more- even 1 1/2 cups if that's what makes you happy :) Also, this makes a pretty thin sauce- use another couple tablespoons of flour if you want something thicker.

I found this to be a great sauce.  I cut it by 1/3 as I was using it over broccoli.  It worked out great and had a nice flavor, not too overwhelming, but enough so that it was plenty flavorful.  I am saving the remainder of the sauce to use tomorrow over pasta. Also, I used skim milk and it was plenty thick.

This is a great cheese sauce and I feel the negative reviews are because the recipe assumes that the cook knows how to make a roux. You have to let the flour cook for a couple of minutes stirring constantly over medium heat for the flour to lose it's raw flavor. THEN add the milk and continue to stir until it begins to thicken. I revised the amount of milk and cheese as some other reviewers suggested. I used 2 cups milk and 1 cup gorgonzola cheese. It was delicious served over baked chicken and bow tie pasta. Thanks Sal for the recipe!

Here i go - rating a recipe with "my" changes, sorry!  This sauce is SO easy and awesome BUT I only used 2 cups milk and increased to 1 cup Gorgonzola cheese - we love a stronger, flavorful sauce. (similar comments from others prompted m o make these changes).  LOVED it and will keep in my favorites  - thanks r the recipe!!  ;)

Quick & easy sauce. We enjoyed the sauce by dipping thick-cut strips of Italian bread into it. Would make this again.

Very nice, took a little while for the cheese to melt, but all in all, it turned out very good. Rich flavor, but not overwhelming.

I think the instructions are a bit backward - I put part of the "milk" (I actually used half & half) in first and then waited until it got really hot before adding the rest of the milk, in which I had added the flour.  If it's not hot enough, it won't thicken.  The gorgonzola is strong, but if you like gorgonzola, this sauce is for you.  I seasoned with a lot of pepper and a little salt to cut the strength, but my mom loved it!

This would have been very bland if I hadn't altered it quite a bit.  I used two cups of milk, two tablespoons of flour, one cup of gorgonzola, and added garlic.  Even so, it just tasted like a decent alfredo sauce.  I love gorgonzola, so I think I'll stick to using it on my salads where I can really taste the flavor!

Wow!  I recently fell in love with gorgonzola cheese, but thought it would be more difficult to duplicate the rich flavor of restaurant gorgonzola pasta sauces.  I was sure wrong!  This will become a regular in our household.  (My husband and I love the flavor of gorgonzola, so I added twice as much as the recipe called for.)

Gorgonzola is far too subtle and noble a cheese to be used in a floury sauce, so of course the taste is lost. Criminel i say !

We didn't think there was much flavor.  We added a tsp of garlic powder and a tsp of onion powder to give it some life, but it still needs more....

It was easy to make and was packed with great flavor. Will definitely make it again. I started by marinating some bison  filet steaks and let those marinate for a couple of days.  When I cooked them, I made sure the meat was room temperature, seared them in a hot skillet, carmelized onions ,and then made the Gorgonzola sauce. The pungent flavor of the sauce with the sweetness of the carmelized onions give a nice flavor in your mouth. I will definitely make this sauce again.

This was a really good recipe to start with as I wanted a cheesy cream sauce but had no heavy cream or half & half. It definitely needed tweaking, though, as many others have noted. I reduced the milk down to 2.5 cups and increased the flour to about 4 tbsp and the cheese to 1.5 cups. I also added garlic and, as a last step, bacon. Once said and done, it was amazing on top of elbow noodles for a "fancy" mac n' cheese.

I made the basic recipe and it was pretty fantastic, I really enjoyed it over gnocchi but I think it could use some additions, I'll have to read the other reviews and see what has already been tried.

Nice start, but i agree with most the other guys, cut back on the flour and infuse more cheese and use cream instead or as well as milk.  Parmesan mixes well with gorgonzola and takes a bit of the sharp edge off that the gorgonzola leaves

I made sauce with feta cheese instead of gorgonzola cheese, because it was what I had.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and used about 1 cup of cheese rather than 1/3.  Served over chunked chicken cutlets, spinach and gnocchi and it was FABULOUS!  I will definitely be making it again, thanks for the great recipe!

You HAVE to add about 1/4 cup of parmesan, and saute fresh mushrooms and garlic.  add  garlic powder, too.  It doesnt taste right without it!!  put in with grilled chicken strips and penne noodles and it will taste even better than Johnny Carino's !! hehe

I agree - there's not enough cheese to label this *Gorgonzola* - it's more like a roux,  Maybe if I added a cup or more of the cheese it would work but I think there are better recipes out there.

Considering I don't really care for Gorgonzola this sauce is amazing! My mom bought a huge block of this cheese and I didn't know what to do with it and this recipe was exactly what I needed!! I added garlic like someone else suggested  and more cheese/milk. If you love to cook you can get very creative with this recipe!! Great base for any cheese/white sauce, Thank you for sharing ;-)
* used it with cheese tortellini

I adjusted the recipe to 6 servings via the site here, as I didn't have a pan big enough to cook it in otherwise. Followed directions exactly, and the sauce had barely thickened. Wound up putting in an entire 5oz of Gorgonzola as well as several shakes of parm, and a few more tablespoons of flour to thicken, and it came out decent. Also to my own taste I added lots of black pepper and garlic.

I strongly recommend adding the gorgonzola a little at a time to suit your taste on this one. My cheese was high quality and very pungeont and made the sauce overwelming in taste. Next time I think i will omit the gorgonzola and just add garlic and parmesan for an alfredo that will work on pasta.

This recipe is similar to the one that I make that is the same as the Gorgonzola Alfredo served at Olive Garden.  Biggest differences...no rue to begin, half & half instead of milk, & parmesan cheese.  But this one I will try because it's less likely to curdle (which I've had happen with the other!).

Thanks!

I love this recipe bc I usually go to my favorite Italian and get it.  I always tell them to add Roasted red peppers.  Over tortellini with chicken, it's fabulous.  I also changed to half and half to make it thicker

I was not that crazy about this sauce, although I used a full cup of cheese, salt and black pepper.  I think perhaps this is a cheese I prefer unmelted, like on a cold salad - Mandarin Orange, Gorgonzola and Almond Delight is my favorite so far!

Excellent recipe.  I did use it for another cheese that I disliked (Red Hawk by Cowgirl Creamery).  I only added 2 cups of milk, 2 handfuls of flour, and I added chopped onions to the butter while it was melting (I used more butter than it called for) and added garlic to it as well.  It was delicious.  I put it over the veggies and the Quorn patty that we had for dinner.
