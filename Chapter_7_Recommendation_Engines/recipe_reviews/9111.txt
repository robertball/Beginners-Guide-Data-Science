Okay, after nearly 31 years of cooking, my search for the "definitive" cranberry sauce recipe is over!  This recipe is fantastic!!  I doubled it, split the sugar between half white and half brown and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon (next time I will take that down to 1/4 teaspoon).  I cooked this for almost 20 minutes.  This was the best cranberry sauce I have ever had!  I used to just resort to canned because I never seemed to be able to make a "good" cranberry sauce.  Toni, thank you for sharing this recipe, it was another huge hit on our Thanksgiving table this past weekend.  (We had to celebrate early this year.)

I mixed this recipe with another one I use.  I boiled the cranberries and sugar in 1/2 cup OJ and 1/2 cup unsweetened pineapple juice until they popped.  Then I added 6 oz. of fresh raspberries and mashed the whole thing.  Finally, I added 1/4 cup grand marinier, a 14 oz. can of crushed pineapple (drained), and some crushed peacans.  I cooked the mixture on medium heat until thickened, and refrigerated overnight.  Yum!

This is so good!  I am a big fan of the canned jellied cranberry sauce, but now I am a convert.  Never again will I buy cranberry sauce, I will always make it.  This was so easy to make...and SO DELICIOUS!   And yes,cranberries do pop when boiled, so put the splatter guard on and let the kids listen.  I let them cook longer than 10 minutes just so it would get a little thicker, but after it is cooled it does thicken up more.  While they were boiling I gave them a good mash or two with my potato masher and the consistency was perfect.  Thank you Toni!

I made this recipe this Thanksgiving, but changed it slightly.  I added about 1 tsp grated orange rind and after the berrys were cooked down I added about 1/8 cup of Grand Marinier. 

Not too many of my family like cranberries in any shape for form, but my nephew ( 13 years old ) loved it and asked to take some home.   I loved it and even put it on top of my oatmeal the next morning.   The juice was wonderful.  I would make it again.

I was frantic for a quick and easy recipe as my other cranberry did not turn out as expected.  I chose this one.  As most of the reviewers pointed out, this was runny, but the flavor was great and the color was beautiful.  Adding a touch of grand marnier is ingenious. If you want a more gelled sauce, simply cut the OJ to 1/2 cup!  Once they start popping mash them with the back of a spoon.  This will gel in just a few hours in the fridge.  As it is, it is more of a delicious cranberry preserve - very spreadable for sandwiches!

I have been making this for several years now and it is ALWAYS a huge hit at my Thanksgiving dinner! Even people who don't normally eat cranberry sauce seem to enjoy this. I have learned over the years a few little secrets to perfect this recipe... First, use half cup of white sugar and half cup of brown sugar. Second, add a few pinches of cinnamon to your desired taste. Other than those couple of things, make it as directed. It really couldn't be easier or any more delicious! Trust me, you will never go back to the canned junk again!!!

Great recipe.  If you like it on the thick side like me I would recommend cooking it a bit longer.

Way too sweet. Using orange juice over water adds extra sugar/calories and taste that takes away from the tart nature of the cranberries. I would also recommend less sugar. No reason to take healthy cranberries and ruin them in a sugar-laden sauce.

To give it a little more flavour I added only 3/4 of a cup of orange juice and after it was cooked I added 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

This recipe was really tasty! I cooked it until most of the cranberries popped, and mashed it up a bit and left them in, and it was fantastic! Thank you :)

Delicious! I will never buy canned sauce again. This was sooooo easy and sooooo tasty. Get ready for compliments when you make this simple dish. I used frozen cranberries that had been thawed. I also poured mine into a blender and pulsed it 3 times and then chilled it in the fridge. Delicious!

This is the best sauce.  I have been making this recipe with either orange juice, water or apple juice for the liquid.  The orange juice really makes it hands down the best.  For those who say it is too thin, cook it longer.  Cranberries have pectin in them.  The sauce naturally thickens the longer it cooks.  I have been known to overcook it an it be way too thick.  It can get as stiff as the stuff in the can and worse.  I cook until all the berries have popped and I have smooshed them against the edge of the pan.  Then it is perfect.

This cranberry sauce is to die for. I have been making this recipe for years and will never use another. I add the fleshy part of one naval orange chopped with all white pith removed, stirring it in before cooling sauce at room temp. Brings this sauce from great to fantastic! It is impossible to mess up this recipe. I make thisup to 3 days in advance, it allows the flavors to blend and is one less thing that you will need to worry about on a busy day.

I am so glad that I read the reviews and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I used 1/2cup orange juice, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I wasnt sure when I was supposed to add the cranberries, but I waited until the mixture was steaming, then added them. It seemed like it was taking a while for it to warm up, so I walked away and within 2 minutes my daughter ran outside to let me know the pot had boiled over. HUGE mess, so, don't walk away from this stuff (probably common sense to anyone else, but I dont cook much). It tastes AMAZING. I will NEVER buy canned cranberry sauce again.

Spectacular celebration of the clean, tart flavor of cranberries. As noted, making it at least 24 hours in advance gives the orange flavor proper time to mellow and meld into the cranberries. The thickness is easily tailored to your tastes. Allow it to cook 3-5 minutes more for a thicker preparation. We did not find it to be overly sweet. A+ for the simple preparation, and gloriously fresh, uncomplicated flavor.

This is an awesome easy sub for the canned junk. I would recommend one small change that makes it perfect; cut the OJ in 3/4 and add the other 1/4 with Grand Marnier, also add one cinnamon stick. You will be pleased with the results believe me.

This was really tasty, though after  reading some of the reviews,  did make a few changes. I only used 3/4 cup of orange juice, threw in about 1/2 cup of a frozen blueberry/raspberry/blackberry mixture, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Let ths simmer about 15 min., mashing the berries with the back of a wooden spoon as they cooked. Let cool for a few minutes then added 1/8 cup of grand marnier. It was already quite thick when I put it in the refrgerator so I think it will be perfect for the big day tomorrow. Of course I had to taste it and it's already delicious, I can't wait to try it with the turkey. Definitely a keeper!

Well I planned on making this as written... bought the cranberries and thought I had OJ in the fridge. Turns out the what I had was 100% juice blend of white grape, apple, orange and mango. So I used that instead and chopped up an orange for good measure. Turned out great!

Hope I can find fresh Cranberries all year round. Great Sauce. Not just for the Holiday's. Served it with goat cheese and pita chips. Also great on sliced chicken or turkey sandwiches. My favorite is on chicken salad on a croissant. Oh, it just gets better the next day or 2.

I read the other reviews before I made this and thought I would return the favor now. This is amazing. Our family always eats the canned jellied cranberry sauce and this is so much better. I boiled it for way longer than the directions said because I wanted it thick. Then I put it through a strainer so I wouldnt have the whole berries. This will definitely be competition for Ocean Spray!

Excellent and a lesson learned for others.  I was multitasking while making this with a loose lid for spatters.  It overflowed!  I also saved 1/8 of a cup of cranberry sauce after pouring in mold, blended an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese in the same pan while warm and made a great spread for bagels, bread........

This is a good cranberry sauce. I doctored it up a bit. I use 1 bag of cranberries, 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of water. While it's cooking I add 2 peeled oranges and 2 green-skinned apples (they have more pectin in them) cored but with the skins on. Granny Smith works best. After the cranberries have popped and the apples are completely cooked, I put the sauce through a ricer to remove the skins of the cranberries and apples. The pectin in the apples helps the sauce to thicken. My family loves it. It just wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it!

This is a good "base" recipe that you can play around with to your liking in terms of sweetness, texture, etc. I took other reviewers' tips and adjusted the recipe as follows: I used half as much sugar as the recipe calls for and used both brown and white sugar.  I also used half water half OJ because as one reviewer mentioned, too much OJ will take away from the cranberry's tart flavor.  I also added a sache of cloves and removed it after I simmered saucefor about 20-30 minutes. I like mine smooth with a few cranberry lumps.

Fantastic!! I haven't ever liked the "real" cranberry sauce my mother makes at holidays, (but I always ate a bit to be nice). I used half white and half brown sugar, and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. I also went through the berries before I put them in the pan, making sure to remove any stems. Nothing will ruin your enjoyment of a dish like a stray branch.  I am definitely a convert. I will probably not eat the canned stuff again!

I've made this a few times, but I accidentally discovered a way to make these turn out smoother tasting and less tart.   My "accident" was that I forgot about the berries cooking in the juice and sugar on the stove. The sauce was very thick by this point. To compensate, I added 1/2 cup more orange juice and let it cook for a few more minutes. The result was a thick, rich, and smooth sauce with a deeply sweet flavor along with the slight tang and freshness of the extra orange juice. It turned out incredible!

This recipe was so easy and turned out wonderfully.  However, the second time I made it, I cut the sugar to 3/4 C., which brightened the taste and allowed the fruit to stand on its own more.  I also doubled the cook time to 20 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken a bit more.  I now make it whenever fresh cranberries are available in the stores.

Soooo good!  I am in love with cranberry sauce, but usually only the jellied kind that's awful for you.  I wasn't sure I'd like this but it was great!  My husband hates cranberry sauce and he thought this was the best part of Thanksgiving dinner.  Granted, I messed up the dinner, but this I did right and it was fantastic!

I have been making this recipe for years-always a favorite at every Thanksgiving dinner. It's really best tasting if you use fresh orange juice! I love it spread on my turkey sandwiches the next day, mixed with some mayonnaise.

This turned out wonderfully. I only used half of the orange juice, as suggested by others, so it wouldn't be watery. Next time I think I'll try with water, though made with the orange juice it has the perfect sweet and tart balance with a delightful hint of orange. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Really really delicious!  I too made some changes.  I took the advice of others and used 3/4 cup OJ and 1/4 Grand Marnier.  I used 3/4cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg and two cloves.  I also added a handful of dehydrated onion.  FABULOUS!

I haven't bought cranberry sauce in decades and found this to be the same as mine - so I love it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of the OJ.  I agree about the calories but am also trying to minimize processed foods in our lives.  I would recommend juicing 1 or 2 CLEMENTINES into the water/sugar mix.  Zest a bit of the skin and you will absolutely love the taste, calories and the raves from the guests at your table.  I use this sauce year round, thus I freeze small portions for the roast chickens I do throughout the year.

Wow!  This sauce tastes fantastic!  You will not be disappointed.  It has such a nice flavor.  The sauce really needs to be boiled, though, rather than just heated on medium.  Boiling it for the 10 minutes will cause all the berries to pop.  It will foam up but that will go away as it cools.  Just stir constantly while boiling.  It's worth it!!  Great idea to use the orange juice.

Mmmmm this is the best cranberry sauce! I LOVE it, so simple, so good! I just made it (a couple days early) for Thanksgiving and kept having little tastes and it is wonderful! Last year I made the Cranberry Sauce Extraordinaire from this site and I like this so much better, plus it's a lot easier to prepare. It's just perfect! I hope it sets up okay in the fridge although I like it more of a sauce consistancy like it is right now. This is the best, I won't try another cranberry sauce recipe again, maybe tweak this one with a little cinnamon or brown sugar but really, it's great just the way it's written.

My husband always liked that nasty cranberry jelly from a can, but when he tried this, his mind changed completely.  Everyone who tried this thought it was great.  Thank you for saving us from having to eat that canned jelly stuff.

I used 3/4 cup orange juice plus 1/4 cup nice red wine and juiced one orange in addition.  Added the whole orange after I juiced it and cooked it with the berries.  Agree with other posters about covering with splatter screen, and I popped most of the berries (fun) as they were cooking.  Also used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar as suggested below.  Very nice, thanks Toni!

So yummy!! Everyone liked it. I gave it 4 stars because it never settled for me, it was runny even after sitting all night in the fridge. I did use frozen cranberries may be that's why (edit I changed rating to 5 after I made this several times with fresh cranberries, the sauce settles just fine, no problems, but you do need to cook it longer, 15-20 minutes). Now I add gelatin (edit to frozen cranberries), we like jello like texture. I also took someone's advise and added a few raspberries (about 6-10 berries), and some cinnamon. Orange juice, raspberries, cinnamon give this jello outstanding flavor. I opened a can of cranberry sauce after this one was gone, it was absolutely horrible haha and we used to like it!!

EXCELLENT!  I didn't realize I had used some of the cranberries so I weighed them on my kitchen scale.  Since I only had 9 ozs. I made 3/4 the recipe.   My daughter makes this for our family Thanksgiving (with walnuts), so I knew it would be good.  EXCELLENT as always.  Thank you Toni for sharing!!  (I only wish I had the walnuts)

I just finished making this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner (tomorrow). My girlfriend's orange tree is sagging with fruit, so I used freshly squeezed OJ and left all the pulp in. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, as one poster suggested -- it is AMAZING. I will literally NEVER use another recipe. :)

Not a cranberry sauce eater but thought I'd try homemade to see if it made a difference.  BOY does it!!!  I did modify based on other reviewers recommendations - used 1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, and a DASH of cinnamon at the end.  The molasses in the brown sugar helps to mellow the OJ and the cinnamon just brings it all together.  I think I'll try it with apple juice next time just for kicks :)

So simple, it came out great! Made two batches, one altered, one not. On one I followed the suggestions of brown/white sugars, a little cinnamon, and even a little bit of vannila. They both were great tasteing! One traditional which I'll use on Thanksgiving, and the spiced one for christmas :o)

i rated this recipe as written and it was very good.  Then the next batch i used (Lexi, Jack and Cookie's) version 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/4 teas. of cinnamon.  i tasted then both side by side and their version is 5 stars!  it just seemed to have a more complex taste.

So this was an interesting experience for me. I had never made cranberry sauce before when I decided to try this recipe for thanksgiving. I was not quite sure what to expect but, was a little disappointed with how thin the liquid seemed to remain even after refrigerating it. The flavor was good and I will try it again.

Absolutely amazing as written!  I decrease my orange juice to 3/4 cup and then add 1/4 cup Grand Marnier close to the end, and also add the zest of one orange for a little more orange flavor.

Easy and great. I upped the recipe by 150%, except for the sugar and it was delicious. 16 ounces cranberries (1.5 bags), 1.5 cups oj, and only ONE cup sugar. 
Another tip: The cranberries pop a bit when boiling, so make sure to pull the pot fromt the heat when they start to pop.

Very good! It tastes better about a day after making it, after the flavors have plenty of time to mingle. I add threw in a cinnamon stick while it was cooking, a little ground cinnamon, and the zest of about half an orange. Really wish it would have had more of an orange flavor, but it was still fantastic. Next time I will try it with the Grand Marnier that others mentioned. Thanks :)

I have never had real cranberry sauce before, and liked it, until this recipe.  Call me crazy but i grew up with the canned kind, and still prefer it, but this comes in a close 2nd.  I used half brown sugar and half white.  This thickened up great after cooling.  My picky husband said this was his new fav.

great recipe !!!   I make this every year for Thanksgiving.  It thickens as it sits covered in the fridge.  Those having trouble with it jelling properly, would do well to make it a few days in advance.  It tastes better also.

This tastes just like the cranberry sauce that my great grandmother used to make, without all the fuss!  Just make sure you watch it as it is cooking... I boiled mine all over the stove.  What a mess!  But worth the cleanup!

No one would touch this on Thanksgiving!! I was so excited to make my own cranberry sauce and chose this receipe to follow. What I got was cranberry soup with a hint of cooked oranges. I thought maybe if it sat longer in the fridge it would be better unfortunately the next day it was still soup :( I have read the receipe over and over hoping I made an error but no. Sorry this was not a winner for us.

Great starter. I did this: 1/2 c apple juice, 1/4c triple sec, 1/4 c brown sug, 1/2 c white sug, 1 chopped granny smith apple, 1/2 c currants, cran, and simmered for 10 min. Nummy! My 5 year old asked to lick the pot. Can't wait to hear the rest of my family's comments.

Holy cow - I never knew how simple making fresh cranberry sauce could be! I changed it up a bit, using the juice of 2 oranges then adding water to make 1 cup.  Also added a sprinkling of orange peel towards the end of cooking.  Yum!

Pretty easy and worth trying. Tastes very similar to the canned cranberry sauce with the whole berries. Same recipe as Cranberry Sauce I on this site. Will use every Thanksgiving. Thanks for submitting!

My mom has always made her cranberry sauce with water and sugar, and it was good, but last year I tried this recipe which simply replaces the water with orange juice.  I used fresh orange juice and added a bit of orange zest, and it was to die for!  I'll never go back!

Super easy recipe!  I add a little rosemary and orange zest to add a extra little flavor.  I've been making the recipe for years.  I also do a low sugar version for my grandmother using splenda instead of sugar.  My grandmother loves it and cannot tell the diffrence.

Doesn't get much easier than this.  I make this every year for Thanksgiving, and each year I have to make more...it disappears so quickly.  I have modified slightly by adding 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 water, or 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 white wine, but always top it with grated orange zest and lemon peel curls to make it sparkle.

This is a great cranberry sauce that lends itself well to many customizations based on personal preferences.... I used half the orange juice (fresh squeezed), about 3/4 of the sugar, added 1/4 cup of orange liqueur, the zest of one orange and about 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots. AMAZING!

This seemed like the perfect recipe. Then I tasted it. I do not care for cooked orange juice, I think it tastes musty. On the plus side: I figured out the mystery "yuck" ingredientt that appears is some mulled wine recipes :o) I dumped in more sugar and boiled until pretty thick then swirled in maybe 1/4 c. Of fresh OJ when I took it off the heat. Yum!  I guess my perfect recipe will be 12 oz cranberries boiled with 1 c sugar & 1/2 c water. Then add 1/2 cold oj and chilled. Yum! Well maybe more sugar? We use it as a spread for cold turkey sandwiches.

After using this recipe for at least three Thanksgiving dinners, the least I can do it give it the credit it deserves.  This is the easiest, most delicious part of the menu.  My daughter and I make this together and she loves the hiss and pop of the cranberries.  I do add a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg and a tiny bit of powdered clove, AMAZING!!

First batch I made exactly as directed. It was runny and a little too tart tasting (but still very good). For the second batch, I took the suggestion of only using a half cup of OJ and it turned out absolutely delicious but it gelled a little too much. Now I'm working on batch number 3. I used a little more than 1/2 cup but not quite 3/4 cup orange juice and I'm hoping it'll be just right.
Also, definitely use fresh squeezed orange juice to get that super fresh taste. Concentrated OJ makes it too sweet and kind of "preserved" tasting.

This was a very tasty addition to christmas dinner, and smelled lovely when it was cooking! I added a dash of cinnamon to it also.

This is so good.  Just the right amount of orange flavor.  Not too tart and not too sweet.  It's just right!

Wonderful.  I want to try your suggestions to find more spice and less orange.  UPDATE: I reduced the amount of orange juice to 1/2 cup and added a tablespoon of Cointreau (I was out of Grand Marnier).  It was wonderful!

Wonderful recipe and so much better than the stuff in the can.  Even the non cranberry sauce eaters who were willing to try loved it.  No more canned for our family!! Thanks for the recipe, Toni.

This recipe is so simple. My boyfriend gave me "Mom's advise" cook it until you hear it popping and then once the popping seems to slow down take it off the heat & cool. We added cinnamon, and clove (maybe 1/8) to taste. Keep it in the background flavor- that spice that you just can't put your finger on. I also did half white/half brown sugar since I'm trying to find ways to use up the 5lb bag I bought.

this was wonderful and soooooooooo easy! i used 1c sugar and 1/2 c brn sugar and 16oz fresh cranberries. i also only used 1/2 oj and 1/2 water but think next time i will use more oj because i liked the way it cut the tartness of the cranberries. i also added a dash of cinnamon. yum!! be careful though cause this will boil over real quick! i went 2 get the remote to change the chanel and heard it boiling over right then! yummy! no more store bought for me!

Really quick and easy. I thought it was a bit too sweet for me so I reduced the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I think I might reduce it even more to 2/3 cup next time. Overall great recipe though!

This is an excellent basic cranberry sauce.  In the past, I always made a version with nuts and apples in it, but my family doesn't care for it, and I end up eating it all myself.  This year I decided to try something different.  The only changes I made were I added some grated orange zest and about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (because I saw Tyler Florence make a similar version yesterday on Food Network, and he used a cinnamon stick & grated orange zest).  Excellent!  I highly recommend.

This has been my absolute favorite recipe for several years. Am asked to bring it just about everywhere over the holidays.  The recipe I was given is only slightly different - it calls for 2 slightly under ripe PEARS!  I don't bother will peeling them..just core and cut into medium chunks. The orange zest polishes it off nicely..I make it several says in advance (or not..if I can't stay out of it)  Always make more than you think you need..it never lasts.  It's great on oatmeal, cottage cheese..goes well with fish,too. Best thing is that it will keep in fridge almost indefinitely! Whenever I can find fresh cranberries...I love to make it..not just for the holidays. Bon apetit!

simple, easy to make and very tasty!  i like to use apple juice instead of orange, but it turns out very well both ways!

there's no going back to canned after making it fresh.  :)

Not a cranberry eater but this good!  And so easy to make!  Who knew?  I did as others suggested, though, and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugars and a small amount of cinnamon.  No more cans at holidays!

So very simple and delicious.  I used orange pineapple juice.  It was the perfect consistency and tasted so good with our roaasted chicken dinner.  I was happy to find that bag of leftover cranberries in the freezer.

Ooh LA LA! Have made this recipe for years! It only gets better. The reviews are always wonderful! I've tweaked the recipe as such (really like the cranberry flavor & orange to "pop" together in your mouth): one 12 oz bag cranberries, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar,  3/4 cup OJ, 1/4 cup water (+/-), zest of one orange, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Cook about 15-18 minutes. You'll never go back to canned cranberries again!!!   Thank you Toni for sharing!

I made this homemade cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving & it was excellent! Thank you very much for this recipe. It tasted delicious, was the perfect jewel tone red color with a mixture of big berries & the cooked down sauce. I'll never try any other recipe for cranberry sauce as this one is superb & PERFECT. Sweet & tart & juicy & delicious hot or cold.

My son is crazy over his version of cranberry sauce....the kind that comes in a can. Yuck!! I saw this recipe and it looks so easy. I gave it a whirl and boy is it yummy. I don't even like cranberry sauce either. But this I will eat. My son loved it as well. I'll be adding this to our Thanksgiving menu. No more canned yuck in this house!!!

Perfection.  Just what cranberry sauce should taste like. Even my 6 year old son loved it. I used 3/4 cup sugar and added a cinnamon stick. Can't wait to have it on my turkey sandwich tomorrow. :)

A perfect recipe. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. It came out a bit on the sour side which is perfect for my taste. But if you have sweet teeth, add all the sugar that the recipe calls for. So quick and easy to make. I'll make this any time that I find fresh cranberries in the supermarket.

I've made this several times and it's so good!  Even people who don't like cranberry sauce likes this one!  It tastes very fresh and is so incredibly EASY to make!  I put a little cinnamon in it and WOW.  HIGHLY recommend.

Excellent! I reduced the amount of liquid and sugar slightly. I also cooked longer and mashed the cranberries with the back of my spoon for a thicker sauce.

I've made this PERFECT cranberry sauce for two holiday seasons.  ok... um.. YUM, YUM, YUM!  Just like mom makes... but better :)  A little orange zest and a dash of cinnamon.  I'll pass on the dried out turkey; just give me seconds of this!

This one is a winner! It is so easy to make and looks and tastes like it took you all day. I'll never buy canned cranberry sauce again! Another reviewer suggested to use any leftovers on oatmeal or as a pancake topping the next day. It's awesome on oatmeal! A few guests ate this all by itself. Thanks for sharing. I'll be using this from here on out.

This is a great recipe. So simple to make and the family loves it. One of the few things I have been asked to make multiple times. Like other reviews say, I reduced orange juice to 3/4c and added 1/4c grand marnier and orange zest.

This was my 1st cranberry relish I've made and it was a HUGE hit with everyone on Christmas! I used "most pulp" OJ, and based on some of the other reviews I made the following changes:
*Cooked it a bit longer ( about 20 mins ) 
*Mashed the cranberries to get a thicker consistency
*Added a dash of cinnamon to taste.
It turned out delish! I was worried it would be a bit tart, and when I make it again I might add about .25 cup more sugar but everyone else raved that the sweetness balanced perfectly w/the tartness. Depends on taste I guess! I def recommend - Easy and very quick to make. So much better than store bought - I'm a convert!

I usually don't have any cranberry sauce when it is served, but my daughter made this sauce and it was fabulous. I will eat it during the holidays from now on! Very good sauce!

This was my first attempt at making cranberry sauce and it turned out awesome!  I had no clue that it was that easy.  As other reviewers stated, I had to lengthen the cooking time. I liked the flavor as is, but then decided to sprinkle some pumpkin pie spice in there, which made it that much more flavorful.   I prepared it the day before Christmas and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, and it thickened up to a nice consistency.

I have never cared for cranberry sauce, but thought I'd give it a try this holiday season with all the dinners I was making. It was simply perfect! Sweet enough to completment the brined turkey, but not overwhelming in either the taste or texture. I've been asked repeatedly for my "secret!" who knew it could be so easy?

This was fantastic. I used Stevia instead of sugar and made my own juice with a florida navel orange in the blender. It was so simple and so flavorful, especially with a little orange zest added.. I am so happy I found this recipe.

Everyone really enjoyed this and all agreed it is much much better than the canned stuff. Like other reviewers I only used 3/4 cup of  o.j. then cooked mine a bit longer and then strained it because I know some of my picky eaters don't like whole berry sauce. I'm glad I made the day before because it seemed to get better every day - it was extremly tart when first made but the tartness mellowed overnight.

Perfect! This cranberry sauce is bright, fresh, not too tart and not too sweet. Loved using orange juice instead of water. I added a little of the orange's zest for extra zing. My new favorite!

After being married 43 years, I decided to try my hand at homemade cranberry sauce this year.  I looked through Allrecipes.com for a recipe and chose this one.  I just finished making it this morning so I could "test it out" -- that would give me time to buy more canned sauce if need be -- but OH MY!  This is so simple and absolutely the best sauce ever!  The only thing I did differently was to add a big spoonful of orange marmalade while cooking the cranberries.  Made a generous bowl full and I bet we'll eat it all!  I can't wait for my husband to taste it.  Thanks for this recipe Toni.  Bye bye canned sauce!

This was wonderful!  I followed another reviewers tip and used 1/2C white sugar and 1/2C brown sugar.  For some reason my cranberries never popped, so I wound up cooking them for roughly 15-18 minutes.  Of all the things on my plate, I have to admit that I liked this best.  I can't wait to make this for my family on Thanksgiving.  So easy - I will never open another can of store-bought cranberry sauce!

Amazing! I have never made homemade cranberry sauce before and didn't relize how easy it could be. This was absolutely the best cranberry sauce I have ever tasted, and I will make it again every year. I followed someone else's suggestion and used half white and half brown sugar along with 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Perfect.

Wonderful dish.  I served this on Thanksgiving and received several compliments.  I don't think I can ever go back to the cranberry gel in a can after having this.

This is the basic cranberry recipe that I follow -- it always turns out beautifully.  The recipe is easy and quick, but the flavors are amazing!  I use half brown and half white sugar, but otherwise follow the directions exactly.

The taste of cranberries is so wonderful that I don't like to cover it up with too many additions, so just sugar and OJ is perfect!

Lovely!  It looked nice and tasted great.  I didn't add quite as much sugar as the recipe called for.

Just like everyone else has stated....  THIS REALLY IS THE BEST CRANBERRY SAUCE EVER!!!  All I added was a cinnamon stick or two while it was boiling.  This was the very first time I made cranberry sauce and anyone would have thought this recipe was a family tradition... it is now!!

perfectly simple and fool proof.  I cooked mine too way past the pop stage and mashed half the berries.  cannot stand to not tinker with a recipe so I added Grand Marnier, a few cloves, a few paper thin slices of ginger and zest of one lemon.  Stirred in diced green apple, walnut pieces, chopped celery, and a can of mandarin orange segments at the end.  I'll never buy canned again!

This is so good!!! After reading the reviews, I decided to do use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, plus a dash of cinnamon. I also cooked it 15-20 minutes to get a thicker sauce. Perfect on its own or as a spread for turkey, cream cheese, & cranberry sauce sandwiches.

Very good!  I've never made cranberry sauce with OJ before, I really liked it!  Unlike others, I DO like canned cranberry sauce and this isn't a sub for it, any more than baked homemade mac and cheese is a sub for the blue box.  It's a completely different thing!  I used fresh orange juice, and zested the orange into the mixture as well.  I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I would be very cautious about changing/lessening the amount of sugar here, if you're going to do that do it well enough in advance to be able to add more if needed.  I used the full amount of sugar and mine was very tart. Just a great recipe, and one we'll make again!

I've never liked cranberry sauce--it is always so bitter coming from a can! I made this tonight for our Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow, and I guess I'm a cranberry sauce fan now! My 2-year old ate 2 bowls of it! I just hope it makes it to dinner! I'm looking forward to using it on leftover turkey sandwiches too! I used 3/4 C white sugar and 1/4 C brown sugar, and put 2 cinnamon sticks in while it was cooking, removing them afterwards.

Great, easy recipe. A little too orangey for me, next time I might do 1/2 water 1/2 OJ. Hubby liked it as-is.

Just made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  OJ container was almost empty, so I used about half OJ and half apple cider.  Dashed in some nutmeg.  Whole thing took about 5min from the time I printed off the recipe, and it's delicious (and I'm not a huge cranberry sauce fan).

Excellent and easy! I thought it was cool listening to the cranberries pop as it cooks. My only changes to the recipe were using half brown sugar and half white and adding a dash of cinnamon.

I was out of OJ, so I dissolved my sugar in a little cranberry juice then added a cup of orange marmalade during cooking.  It worked great and the zest in the marmalade gave it extra flavor.  I can see this as a great basic recipe that can be adjusted to lots of different tastes and flavorings.

I always end up buying bagged cranberries, and I like to rinse them before cooking. Because I don't like too strong of an orange flavor, I used 1/2 cup OJ and 1/2 cup water. I also add a few splashes of grenadine syrup to taste. Cranberry sauce is my favorite thing to make for Thanksgiving because it's the easiest dish!

Based on the reviews I used brown sugar and white sugar 50/50 and added a cinnamon stick.  I also mashed it a bit with a fork while it was cooking.  I used to make an Emeril recipe but this got better reviews from the family so I will be using this from now on.

The orange juice is a great idea, my family loved it today.  I'd like to add that you need to cook the sauce until all the berries pop, not just until they start popping.  Otherwise it'll be too soupy as not all of the thickening goodness will escape from the fruit.

I use the basic recipe and mix it up every year.  Tonight I used 1/2 cup OJ, 1/2 cup pineapple juice, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I added 1/2 cup of strawberry sauce that I had just made for the Cheesecake.  I am happy with the result and may try some of this on the Cheesecake.  Happy Thanksgiving !

Easy, fragrant, gorgeous and flavorful.  I added the zest of an orange while simmering and stirred in a little cinnamon and nutmeg after I poured it into a bowl to cool.  DELICIOUS!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2007. My sister and several other members of the family loved it. I couldn't get past the orange juice taste. It seemed to overpower the cranberry flavor.

Wonderful!  I cooked it an extra 5 minutes because cranberries were still "popping".  The sauce thickened and had the consistency I was looking for after I let it sit in the refrigerator for several hours (overnight).

As the others said, I will never buy cranberry sauce in a can again.  This is simple and delicious.  I was worried that the orange juice would be overpowering, but it absolutely was not.  My advice is to use a potato masher once the cranberries are soft enough and let it stand in the refrigerator overnight before serving.  I like my foods plain an simple without all the fancy foo foo.  This sauce is simply delicious!

I made this recipe for 60 men.  They absolutely loved it.  I made it two days before my event.  The consistency of the sauce was perfect.  I did have to help the cranberries along with a masher.  This recipe deserves a spot in my recipe box.  You will agree!

So simple and so good!  I've made it twice, both the night before...I think this helps with the flavor and the texture.  I also crushed the berries a little as they were popping.  Great reviews everytime, but with a request for nuts and orange zest in the next batch.  Once making these, I'll never buy sauce again.

I made per the recipe before I made edits and as written, it's still 5 stars. However, to cater to my family's taste, here's what I did:
Instead of 1 c of white sugar, I used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. 
I added the zest from one orange and 1/2 t cinnamon with the cranberries. 
When I took the sauce off the heat, I added about 2 T of Grand Marnier.

This sauce is SO GOOD.

I really like this recipe with orange juice. Only thing I did, I ran out of oranges and I needed just a bit more. A little over 1/4 cup more. I did t know what to do. In fact, I had doubled this recipe for Thanksgiving Day. So I needed 2 cups. Anyway, a thought came to me, I had real cranberry juice in refrigerator. My husband and I drink it every day for good bladder health. So I used the “real” cranberry juice, not the sweeten kind. Anyway, came out wonderful. I cannot wait for family to have this. I know they will love it as much as I do. Happy Thanksgiving Folks!

Followed recipe exactly as it appears-have checked it SEVERAL times to make sure I did it right (I did-not that complicated). It NEVER thickened. I thought it might thicken if I left it in the refridge over night - still cranberry soup next day. Very disappointed. I liked the flavor but not the texture.

I just made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow, but I wish I had doubled the recipe - maybe even tripled.  After the cranberries "cook down," there's barely enough for 4 people - and there will be 10 people here tomorrow.  Kind of a hassle to make more, but maybe there will be a couple of folks who don't care for cranberry sauce.  

That said, the sauce tastes wonderful, but only because I changed a few things.  Like others, I substituted half of the sugar for brown and made the total sugar about 1/2 cup rather than a cup.  I also added a healthy pinch of good-quality cinnamon and a pinch of salt.  Finally, I allowed the berries to simmer for a total of 20 minutes so they would thicken.  

And for heaven sake, people, quit obsessing about sugar for one day a year, okay?  So no dessert at your house either?  I'm glad I won't be part of your crowd.  Mainly, however, the sauce is NOT too sweet  if you follow my recipe.  Cranberries are very very tart and the sugar is necessary.

I am not a cranberry sauce person - never liked it. This is delicious! The combination of tart cranberry and burst of orange tastes and smells wonderful. And yes, it is a breeze to make. I do smack the cranberries around a bit as they cool to make it smoother. Perhaps other people's cranberries submit easier - mine stay pretty much whole.

Very good for cranberry sauce.  Most people in my family aren't big fans of cranberry sauce in general, but like this one fine.  I would almost add more sugar next time to help counteract the tartness of the cranberries, for us.    I did add a pinch of cinnamon, and mixed brown with the white sugar, as others suggested.  I will make again, pretty easy and was good to do the day before.  I did use as a 'jelly' on top of bagel and cream cheese later on and that was quite yummy!

This cranberry sauce has such a beautiful color,and tastes so fresh. I agree with an earlier reviewer who cautioned against letting it boil over - I turned my back and it made quite a mess! Nevertheless, it is perfect for Thanksgiving and I made it a few days early to let the flavors ripen.

I'm fairly new to cooking and this year, I was asked to make a few things for our extended family's Thanksgiving dinner.  Of course I came here,  and tried this recipe first.  No need to keep searching, this is amazing!  I did tweak it a little and added equal amounts of apple and oj (half a cup each),  2 cinnamon sticks as well as equal amounts of brown sugar and white sugar (half a cup each).  It was sooo good!!!  I can't wait to present it and serve it, next week!!!

This so much better than the can!  I can't believe how easy this was. We only had 1/2 cup of orange juice from our orange, so I used 1/2 OJ and 1/2 water.  I cooked ours for twenty minutes and then let it set for three hours.  It was perfect!  Thank you Toni!

I doubled the recipe, used only 1.5 cups of sugar and added a cup of fresh figs off my tree for sweetness. I added orange zest from one orange and a dash of ground clove. I jarred three portions for later.

When I 1st made this, I was tasting the moment it came off the stove. And knowing I used SPLENDA(R) in place of the sugar, I expected to be just a tad tart but it was severely tart. At least when biting into the cranberries it's self(right after making it). However, I cooled and placed in the frig for a few days, and then it seemed the flavors worked their magic and tasted way better after I let sit and the cranberries were not as tart as they previously were.. It's totally worth a few days to wait on the best flavor.

Because of how large my family is, I have to double this recipe but I made a couple of small changes to help reduce the sweetness and acidity. Instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I use 1.5 cups white sugar and .5 cups of brown sugar. Instead of 2 cups of orange juice I use 1.5 cups of orange juice and .5 cups of water. This is double the servings and it might not seem like much of a change but the first time I tried this recipe, I followed it to the letter and, even though everybody liked it, it was too sweet. At Christmas the same same year, I made it how I described above and everyone loved it. I'm no longer allowed to tamper with the recipe! :)

This cranberry sauce is so yummy and easy to make. I was amazed to see how it thickened just by chilling it in the fridge. To give this sauce a little extra zing I added orange zest which was just the right touch.

I've made this in the past and thought it was perfect. After reading reviews I think this thanksgiving I'll follow the advice of another reviewer and add a bit of cinnamon. I'm looking forward to this!

My husband is diabetic, so I used 24 Splenda packets, which equals 1 cup sugar.  The packets were all I had at the time, but you could use the bag of Splenda as well.  I used a Cran-grape juice, but you could use any kind of juice and mix with water, 1/2 cup juice + 1/2 cup water, or use a diet juice instead.  Before these alterations, my husband couldn't touch this yummy, once-in-a-while condiment.  These changes reduce the calories and carbs making it possible for him to not feel like he's missing out.

I made this as written except I put in a cinnamon stick at the end, couldn't really tell it was there.  I had so much left over not hardly anyone even tried it. So I used it in another dish on here Cranberry Dip and mixed it with apricot preserves and I plan on serving it at my christmas party.  I still have some leftover I am mixing it with chili sauce and grape jelly for cocktail dip.

Absolutely fantastic! And amazing that it's so simple! I followed it exactly as written except I cooked it a bit longer ... I'm at a higher altitude and I wanted most of the berries to "pop," to make a thicker sauce. Really the best cranberry sauce I've ever had ... and I used OJ from the carton. I imagine fresh OJ would be even more amazing!

I went half and half with brown and white sugar, and added a pinch of salt, and one cinnamon stick. What a wonderful recipe.
Since fresh cranberries freeze so well, I threw a few extra packages into the freezer for future use.

The sourness of the cranberries alongside the tang and sweetness of the orange juice/ sugar makes this a very well balanced cranberry sauce recipe! I recommend! I used 1/2 light brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar! I also doubled the recipe, but that made WAYYYYY too much cranberry sauce for just 8 people. So if you are cooking for a smaller group, the original serving is fine!

I love cranberry sauce and I paired this with a turkey loaf for dinner, because my husband and myself are concerned with healthy eating, I used Trop 50 orange juice and replaced the sugar with Truvia (a natural sugar substitute) When using a sweetner cut the amount in half, I used a little less than 1/2 cup of Truvia. This came out perfect!

I can't have the sugar so i altered it for me. I used a box of sugar free raspberry jello disolved in the cup of water then per directions on this recipe. The recipe as written is wonderful for the rest of the family and the only reason i did a review with the sugar free is in case someone is looking for a sugar free version. I also tasted the sauce when finished and added around 1/4 cup of spenda to sweeten a little more. 
God Bless....... :)

I didn't know it could be so easy to make a very delicious cranberry sauce! I didn't change and thing, and it was a big hit at Thanksgiving. I plan on making it all through the year because I can't wait until next Thanksgiving to have it again!

This  was my first time making cranberry sauce.  I always thought the canned was good enough.  Never will I buy canned again!  Everyone loved it and I'm so glad I made a large batch because now I have it to serve with my turkey pot pie.  I followed other reviewers and only used 1/2 cup of oj and 1/2 cup water.  I also added another 2 cups or so of cranberries as 12 ounces didn't seen nearly enough.

simple to make and tasted delicious. My mother is a fan of the jelly stuff in a can and actually said she preferred this to it! Will definitely make again.

So easy & the best cranberry sauce i have ever had! Oj gives it an awesome tangy kick. I'd give this 10 stars if it were an option. Who knew this could be so easy?

I have always used the recipe on the back of the  cranberries bag, which is simply water and sugar.  This with the OJ makes it just a bit more special, and I'll use this recipe from now on!

Made this cranberry sauce for the second time this Christmas. Was a HUGE hit with the family. My special needs cousin who is the pickiest eater in the family was spooning it onto his rolls like jam! Wonderful recipe.

I use a little more than half the sugar...the orange juice seems to carry enough. This is so much better than a water recipe.

It was ok. Did not like the citrus taste to it. I prefer a traditional straight cranberry sauce with just cranberries and sugar.

I have never made cranberry sauce before, and this is the first recipe I came accross. Not only was it EXTREMELY easy, it tasted perfect.
This is exactly how I like my cranberry sauce!
The only things I noted for next time were that it was a little runny at first, and even after sitting for a while I think I could have used just a tiny tiny bit less juice? But the next day after it being in my fridge, it was perfectly textured.
And I had to turn my heat to high to get the berries to really pop, and I cooked a tad longer... maybe fifteen minutes.
(Could be my stove)
:)

I had only had canned cranberry sauce before this and I was not a fan. I made this for Thanksgiving and WOW, I personally loved it. My kids and husband aren't fans of cranberry but hubby even loved it. I'm using leftovers tonight to glaze some chicken and veggies, its so good!! Great on rolls, toast and meat.

This was  great recipe! Very tart and delicious, I used raw sugar. It took only about five minutes for the cranberries to start popping. I used a potato masher as someone else suggested for my desired texture. Super easy recipe!

This dish was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I usually don't enjoy Cranberry and Orange mixture, but this was an exception. Instead of 1 cup of plain white sugar I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. When it finished cooking, I decided it wasn't sugary enough. Since I reheat my cranberry sauce before serving, I decided I would add in 1/4 a cup then.

I intended to make this recipe as it was written, or at least with a few minor changes; I cut the sugar 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown, and I also added some turbinado sugar.  I also saw that I had pomegranate arils and so I added those.  It turned out AWESOME!!  I like it on my oatmeal in the morning and also on plain, lowfat yogurt for a snack! YUM!  I'm going to add pecans the next time I make it!

OMG! This is the best cranberry sauce I ever had. I made it as some reviewers stated with 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup orange juice, and a dash of cinnamon. This will make a regular annual appearance on our holiday table. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I can't believe i have been eating canned cranberry sauce all these years!  Love this recipe.  The orange juice gives the sauce a nice tartness.

This recipe is awesome.  It is so easy and quick why would anyone ever buy canned cranberries again.  I did use about 3/4 cup of juice instead of a full cup because other reviews said it was runny.  It was seriously my favorite dish at thanksgiving this year and it was so easy that my 5 year did the whole thing except measure the juice and sugar.  One tip to others is if you like it a bit sweeter or it seems too tart just and a little honey to taste while it is still warm.  Great recipe!!!

This was the best thing on the table besides the Turkey for Thanksgiving. It will be my staple from now on. Will definitely be making this again. The combination of the Cran/Orange flavor is definitely a great match.

FANTASTIC!!! I did the brown/white sugar combo then used OJ consentrate about 1/4 cup and mixed with water till it dissolved and made 3/4 cup liquid, simmered with some cinnamon and ground cloves and mashed them a little and added the Grand Marnier (a 1/4 cup) and I can't stop eating this!!

Never made cranberry but this recipe was easy and delicious. The sauce had a wonderful texture.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because because I thought it tasted very orange juicy.   I ended up adding some cinnamon and brown sugar to change the flavor a bit. I think next time i will cut the orange juice with water.

I loved this and it is way better than canned sauce.  I used a navel orange rather than the orange juice.  Since we wanted a smooth sauce I pureed this in the blender and strained the sauce to remove the seeds.  It tastes wonderful and I love the combination of orange and cranberry.  I will never buy canned sauce again when homemade is this easy!

My first try at home made cranberry sauce. It was perfect! I doubled the recipe and added a teaspoon of Cinnamon (next time I will go with 1/2 teaspoon). I also used half white and half brown sugar as so many recommended. I thought it tasted better after 2 days in the fridge. Won't go back to canned ever!!

My family always has canned cranberry sauce with Thanksgiving dinner. It's a tradition, so we still had the canned version, but I wanted to make homemade sauce. All the comments I received were positive. I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again.

Will never buy canned cranberries again!  Super easy and the TASTE is phenomenal!  Stirred in a dash of cinnamon and a dash of ground ginger for some extra flavor and aroma.  The OJ makes it!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this today.  It was good, but it had a bitter aftertaste.  I think it was too much orange juice.  Next time, as the other review said, I will use 1/2 juice and 1/2 water.  I added about a teaspoon of honey to get rid of the bitter aftertaste.  It worked! Very nice - will make again :)

Made the cranberry sauce using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and just a tad orange peel.  OMG! It is amazing and so simple.  I am going to use this to top a cheesecake for my Christmas dessert.  So easy, so delicious, the true cranberry flavor comes through.

Love the citrus flavor with the cranberries.  This recipe was easy and turned out terrific, without a lot of fuss.  I used some of it to top mini orange-kissed cheesecakes (so delish with the sauce), and saved the rest to have on Thanksgiving.

This is a great, simple cranberry sauce. It is quick and easy and has NO corn syrup! I followed someone else's review of using only a 1/2 cup of orange juice to help thicken the consistency. It works perfectly! I normally buy the organic canned cranberry sauce, and this recipe is a bit more tart. I may cut the orange juice with water next time so it won't be as tart, but it probably depends more on the type of OJ you have. Overall, an excellent and easy recipe. I ate some while it was cooling in the bowl!

This recipe is so easy and delicious! To make a pretty and festive cocktail, use equal parts of the liquid this makes and champagne. It's a yummy holiday mimosa! :)

This has been my basic receipe for years. I add orange zest, cloves and a cinnamon stick while cooking the cranberries for a yummy savory flavor.

Great basic recipe. Note: don't get carried away with letting the cranberries pop. (First time mistake.) To give it and extra kick add some grated ginger (apx. 1/2-1 tsp) or ground ginger (apx. 1/4-1/2 tsp) or to taste.

This cranberry sauce was easy to make and different from traditional cranberry sauces. However, it was a bit too watery. I'd suggest using less orange juice.

This was really WONDERFUL!! I think I just converted my whole family from canned to the real thing this year. I left the cranberries on the stove a lot longer than suggested--I wanted them to be really thick. Let them pop away for a good hour. As they were cooling I tasted and tweaked, added some brown sugar and was liberal with the cinnamon.

I used about 18 oz of cranberries, a little less than one cup of orange juice, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and some cinnamon. It was the perfect blend of sweet and tart. I will NEVER buy cranberry sauce again...my husband was going crazy over it!

This is the first time I have made this and it was fabulous!  I always like ocean spray cranberry jelly, but no more.  This will take it's place.  I made the recipe as written and the juice was frozen from concentrate as I did not have fresh.  I recommend this to any cranberry lover.

So simple yet so delicious. The cranberry sauce lovers really appreciated it. I myself who had never liked it in the past found myself enjoying it with my turkey this year. I find it much better than the canned kind, which weirds me out b/c it is shaped like a can.

I was brought up on canned cranberry sauce every year on Thanksgiving and it never occurred to me to try to make it from scratch but I am sure glad I did. I will never buy canned again! I followed the recipe to a T and this was delicious! Best of all it’s naturally gluten free :)

Perfect for Thanksgiving!  Made the sauce two days in advance.  Didn't change a thing with the recipe.  Update: I now make this with 3/4c orange juice and 1/4c Grand Marnier.

This is the perfect balance of sweet and tart while keeping the cranberries at their peak flavor and color.  I tried another more complicated recipe first, then ended up making this one.  This was the clear winner.  Even the kids were crazy for it.  So simple, too.

Such a tasty and easy recipe!  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, half orange juice and half apple juice, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and a dash of cloves and it turned out WONDERFUL!  Like the other reviewers, my husband couldn't wait until it cooled and ate it as soon as it was done.  This will be a Thanksgiving tradition from now on.  NO MORE TASTELESS CANS!!

I have never been a fan of cranberry sauce because it always came out of a can (blech).  I made this for the first time and for the first time I will be eating cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving.  This recipe is a keeper for me...thanks!

I just made this but I also modified it.  Instead of using orange juice, I used mandarin juice, and when the sauce was done and cooled off I mixed in the drained mandarin slices.   Mandarins complement well w/ cranberries (they are not bitter whatsoever), and it makes a very pretty dish to see the mandarin slices peeking thru the red cranberry sauce.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and a pinch of cinnamon.  I won't ever buy canned cranberries again.  This was the easiest, most relaxing, enjoyable dish I've made for Thanksgiving.  I didn't even have to mash the cranberries at all.   I didn't want any whole, raw cranberries in it, so I let it boil a couple more minutes until the last of the whole cranberries popped.

Sugar substitutes work fine in this.  Homemade cranberry sauce is so easy to make I don't understand why anybody uses canned.  Replacing the water with OJ or another juice makes a subtle but noticeable change in taste.

This is by far the best cranberry sauce I've ever had. I've played with a few different recipes but was never thrilled and this one just blew me away! (even my husband, who would only eat the canned stuff, and swore he'd never like whole berry cranberry sauce, loves it!) I let it cook a little longer than it says here, then transfered it to a bowl and mashed it a little so there would be no completely whole berries, which can be quite sour. Delicious!

Very good and simple!
I cut the sugar in half and use half orange juice/half water, and I add a dash of cinnamon and a tablespoon of rum.
I usually make larger batches of the sauce and can it (just fill the boiling sauce into canning jars and put on the lids immediately). This way, it lasts many months.

Excellent sauce, everyone loved it! I thought it was the best I ever had. Made some changes: Changed to 1/2 cup each white & brown sugars. Added 1/8 cup Grand Marnier & 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Mashed while cooking. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

There is absolutely no reason to buy canned cranberry sauce when this recipe is so easy and so delicious. Takes almost no time to make and could easily feed a large family during Thanksgiving. For an extra kick, I added orange zest and a dash of cinnamon. For a less intensely sweet flavor, use brown sugar instead of white, or use 3/4 cup white sugar. I have made this every year for the past five years and everyone loves it. Thanks so much!!!

This cranberry sauce is almost easier than opening a can.  It's a great basic recipe to work from.  I've used juice from clementines and it's great.  Add some zest, add some brandy or red wine, add some hot pepper flake (just one shake, seriously it doesn't make it spicy, just gives it a zing.  try it), sub in some honey for sugar.   This stuff is great on brie wrapped in phyllo.  It's great with cream cheese, ice cream. I made it too runny once and poured some of the juice off into glasses and added seltzer, that was great.  Really, no need to buy the junk in the can at all.  Eat real food.

This was great. I couldn't get anyone who doesn't like cranberries would try it, but those of us who like cranberries, loved it. Be careful, it will boil over easily and makes a very pretty mess! It's rare not to tweak a recipe - but this one is just right.

This was really good.  It tastes exactly like you would expect orange juice and cranberries to taste.  I think next time I'll do 3/4 c orange juice and 1/4 c water to tone down the orange juice flavor.

Ohmygosh! Just finished making this recipe... Absolutely deelish!! And sooo simple!! I had a big 3 lb bag of cranberries, so I more than tripled this recipe. So glad I did, because I have a feeling this will be eaten all up in a heartbeat for tomorrow's Thanksgiving feast! Slight changes I made: I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Also, cut down on OJ just a tad. Added about a tsp of cinnamon during cooking. Will put in fridge overnight. Thanks for the crazy good recipe Toni !! No more cans! "Stay away from the cans! He hates these cans!!" (Scene from The Jerk)..

I made this tonight for thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. I will be lucky if I have any left for tomorrow! Every time I walk by the fridge I steal a spoonful. I was skeptical at first because I really like canned cranberry sauce, but I gave this recipe a try and WOW. I will never go back to canned. This is the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I cooked the cranberries longer than 10 minutes. I cooked them for about 20 minutes or until almost all the cranberries had popped.

Simple but perfect! Sweet and tangy, and its color is amazing. Probably cut down on the orange juice just a little bit for a thicker consistency.

Do not hesitate to try this recipe. It is the best. Put away those canned cranberry sauce. My son in law cant get enough of this and wants it at Christmas dinner also. You wont be sorry. Im making a triple batch this year so my daughter and son in law have plenty to take home on Thanksgiving.

I have been making this recipe for the last several Thanksgivings/Christmases and it is always a hit!  I have never before eaten cranberry sauce as a snack, but this is so wonderful, I can't stop eating it!  I like to cook it a little longer, so the cranberries are nice and soft, and I also like to add a pinch of cinnamon for a bit extra flavor.  I also find that this sauce gets better after sitting in the fridge for a day or two, but that is hard to do, because everytime I open the fridge door, I'm sneaking spoonfuls out of the bowl!

Let me just say - I volunteered to make this for Thanksgiving and I hate cranberry sauce.. until now.  It was so easy to make. I used the whole cup of OJ but added a pinch of ground ginger and cinnamon.  I also added about a tablespoon of crushed pineapple and some pecans to the top before serving.

I don't know what the canned stuff tastes like but this was pretty good -quick, easy to make & looked pretty.  After reading the reviews I used half brown sugar, half white & added a dash of cinnamon.  I also made the "Pepper Jelly Appetizer" from this site (2 ingredients -delicious -sweet with a little kick) and most people ended up eating that with their turkey instead of the cranberry sauce.  Both were solid additions to our early Thanksgiving table.

I don't like the canned sauce, but this is great. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon & a sprinkle of brown sugar. The cranberries  do pop, but just for the first  couple minutes. I cooked mine for about 20 minutes. I think as long as you cook somewhere between 10-20 minutes you will be okay. I also mashed mine with the back of my wooden spoon while cooking. Very easy to make. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this to satisfy some guests for Thanksgiving and they liked them but we had so much food that there was a lot left over.  I added some things with it later in a blender, don't remember what exactly, olive oil was a big one, and made salad dressing.  It's healthier than store bought and my kids love it!!

This is perfect cranberry sauce!  Easy and tasty!  I love it as is, or for a special kick, I use just 3/4 c of orange juice and add 1/4 c Grand Marinier (my family gave rave reviews last Thanksgiving).  My favorite uses are as a side at Thanksgiving, on top of turkey burgers, or mixed in with my morning oatmeal.  It's excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made the jalapeno cranberry sauce and decided that I should make this one too, just incase someone didn't like the flavor of jalapeno.  This is amazingly good.  The flavor of orange really complements the cranberry.  Try it - you'll never go back to the stuff in the can again!

i've never made cranberry sauce before and this was super easy and turned out really good! the only orange juice i had at home had pineapple juice in it as well, but the sauce turned out wonderfully! i almost think it's a little to sweet so next time i'll cut back the sugar just a tad and see how that works. great recipe!

I am going to rate this recipe as is. I hate it when people rate the recipe after they have made changes to it. So, I think this is almost perfect. I think the sugar should definately be cut back to 1/2 and when I made it a second time I added a small dash of cinammon and a splash of Grand Marnier and it was superb. Also, some reviewers stated they did not know when the cranberries popped. Unless you are blind you can definately tell when they pop. Overall a keeper and we will finally replace the canned cranberries we have every year.

I used half white sugar, and half brown sugar, added a bit of orange zest and used 1/2 cup orange juice, and 1/2 cup of an orange mango blend. This came out wonderfully - just make sure to have enough time to let it cool down and set.

Had a nice orange taste but didn't gel properly and nobody ate it. Also would strain out seeds next time with cheesecloth.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic! I too will never buy canned cranberry sauce again.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written although I did "mash" the cranberries once they popped and I cooked it at a lower temperature for a bit longer in order to allow it to thicken a little more. Have no fear in trying this recipe.

I made this for Christmas.  I did 1/2c orange juice (with pulp) and 1/2c water, 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar.  I also added 1/4tsp of cinnamon and refrigerated for 2 days.  It looked and tasted yummy.

I'm going to be one of those that uses the changed recipe and raves about it.  I did what everyone recommended - half water, half OJ, half brown sugar, half white sugar, dash of cinnamon, orange zest, and cranberries.  It was fabulous.  I mushed the cranberries with the back of the spoon after they popped.  It gave it nice texture.

I have been using this recipe since 2002, and it's a favorite at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I do add more sugar to thicken and cook longer.  I like the idea of cooking the day before.  I will do that this year.  Thank you, Toni, for making our holiday table brighter and more festive.  :)

Easy Peasy!  BUT it does not thicken that much when it cools down. I had to reheat and waited until it reduced then removed from heat to let cool to get that thickness. I would never buy canned again!

This is my first pass at this recipe and scratch-made cranberry sauce, and I love it. However, I did what I almost never do and made changes on the first try, mainly because of what I'd read in other reviews I made a triple batch of this. You better have plans for this after T-Day if you do this. It is a huge pot of loveliness. 

I used 1/2 to 2/3 of the amount of white sugar. I used only a third of a cup of brown sugar, the zest of one whole orange, added two teaspoons of clover honey, a tablespoon or so of salted butter, and a few pinches of cinnamon, to taste. It's just now cooling in a bowl and I can't tell you how excited I am for the family to try this sweet-tart version, close in flavor to lingonberries, which we love.

...looking forward to trying a little Grand Marnier with it sometime in the future.

UPDATE: My whole family raved about this stuff and are beggin for the recipe. We ate it everyday on our oatmeal (which I already add raisins, sliced almost, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to), and I have to make more because we're out and now addicted.

This is a super easy and really good recipe, love it! I wish I had know about this years ago. I was using the can cranberry sauce. I was missing out. No more, this is the go to recipe for homemade cranberry sauce.

Easy and delicious!  Cut back on sugar a little.  Very happy with the taste ... tart but still had some sweetness and looks so festive on a holiday table.  I’ll never get the canned again.

I mashed the cranberry’s a bit and add a cinnamon stick. Let it sit overnight with the stick. I swear it tastes better when you make it at least the night before.

This is a great basic recipes. I use half the sugar and prefer it tart and less calories. Additions I’ve made over years include cooking with a cinnamon stick, adding a touch of cinnamon, using maple syrup to sweeten,  grate in fresh orange zest and adding walnut pieces when finished cooking and more cooled down (a favorite addition!). You can tweak the basic recipe and not mess it up much. I also use 1-10oz individual serving bottle of OJ for thicker sauce. Mash cranberries to desired consistency. Huge hit all around, enjoy all throughout holiday season!.

After reading other reviews I made with 1/2c orange juice and 1/2c water. I added in some fresh orange zest and 1/4 tsp cinnamon to add in a punch of extra flavour which was delicious! I used 1/4c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar. Loved these little changes and will definitely make this my go-to every holiday. No more canned cranberry sauce for me!

Yes, it's the end of January and I'm making another batch of cranberries!  Love this on my oatmeal!  I use half Splenda and half regular sugar and only about 3/4 of a cup total!  I'm going to be honest and tell you I've always used canned cranberries until I found this recipe!  I cook everything homemade for the holidays so I thought why not cranberries!  My family loves this recipe and it's simple!

Perfection. The only thing I did was add a 14 oz can of crushed pineapple (drained). and a cup of crushed pecans. Based on other reviews.  Everyone loved it. I've made it twice and will make it many times in the future! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I had 9 bags of cranberries (99 servings) I used 6.5 cups sugar, zest and juice of 6 oranges, juice topped up with store bought to 4.5 cups. Cooked for 45 minutes, pureed with immersion blender, made 23 x 8 ounce mason jars. Very nice not too sweet with orange undertone. Thanks!

Cranberry sauce doesnt get any easier than this!  I used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar (too much - next time decrease it to 1/3 c. each), 2/3 c. orange juice and 1/4 c. water.  It thickened and gelled perfectly.  Excellent with Thanksgiving meal!

Close watch on the Cooking time is the key to making it the perfect consistency.  I boiled the mixture- full boil.  Then turned it down to LO and cooked for exactly 10 minutes.  Then smashed up the berries and let sit out on the counter until it cooled (about 2 hours).  Then I refrigerated and it was perfect!

Side note, I have cooked it before and the berries were slightly larger and required an extra 5 minutes.  The key is:  if the berries easily mash it is done- if not wait until they are.

Great basic recipe to start from. I used 1/2 cup of pineapple juice, 1 puréed orange, 1 cinnamon stick, zest from half the orange, and reduced the sugar just a little, using 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. It thickened up nicely after about 45 minutes and I had to help some of the cranberries along as they still hadn't popped by the end. Make sure you stir once in awhile, especially once it starts thickening; mine started sticking a bit. I'm planning on serving over a block of Neufchâtel cheese with crackers.

This recipe was phenominal as it was easy to prepare! I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup Tropicana Grovestand OJ with 1 cup of natural pineapple juice (drained the juice from a 20 oz. can of Dole pineapple chucks) as my liquid base and used 1 cup of Sugar and 1 cup of Light Brown Sugar.  I also added 1/8 teaspoon of Orange zest. I followed one reviewers recommendation to cover the pot with a splatter shield. The cranberries gently popped opened and they were an absolute beautiful combination of chunky, almost whole berries and a nicely thickened jelly. The doubled recipe made a little over 6 cups (50 oz). Based on the many reviews, the sweetness of the cranberry sauce intensifies the longer it stays cooled in the fridge, so with that in mind I poured the Cranberry Sauce nto a small Corningware casserole dish, covered it and let it sit in the fridge two days before Thanksgiving day. When it was time to serve, I broke it up a bit with a spoon before scooping it out into a fancy serving dish and garnished it with a small sprig of Rosemary in the middle. The sauce received Oooos & Ahhhhs just before it was gobbled up!! Needless to say, the Ocean Spray stayed in the can and will stay on the grocery store shelf from now on. Lol!!

An easy and excellent go-to recipe!!

This recipe is super simple and the results are great! I have been making this cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving for over a decade. I can't believe how complicated other recipes get when you can go with these simple ingredients and instructions and get such a great sauce. Your search is over, you've found the perfect cranberry sauce recipe.

I went along with most of the comments, and I probably shouldn't have because with the added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon half/half white and brown sugar it tasted like citrusy applesauce.  I've made the original recipe before and I loved it.

OMG! Don't know why I ever bought cranberry sauce! THIS WAS FANTASTIC! :-) & soooo easy!
Only change I made was to use 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white as others have suggested.  I always tripple the recipe now and freeze a bit, so it is always on hand.  Easy to adjust to your liking...another new Thanksgiving tradition!
Thanks! :-)

We started using this recipe 2 Thanksgivings ago and I feel terrible for not having reviewed this earlier! This sauce is just so perfect! And so easy to make. When we first tried this recipe, my daughter was 10, and I had her have a go at it. It was a success! She has made it two years in a row and as always, a success! Relatives always compliment her on her cranberry sauce. She knows the recipe by heart now and is very proud when she makes it. The sauce is not too thick and not too thin in consistency. It's perfectly chunky and the flavor is TO DIE FOR. We come from a family that used to use CANNED CRANBERRY SAUCE for the love of God. So you can imagine the huge difference this change has made to our spread. Thank you!!!!

I will NEVER buy canned cranberry sauce again!  I will NEVER serve Thanksgiving dinner without this recipe!  I plan to make this for other upcoming social events. this recipe is fabulous and easy.  My only concern is finding real cranberries year-round.  The presentation is beautiful.  I recommend that you do not mash the berries at all.  They cook to a soft texture and the round berries are very pretty.  I added a splash of  Chardonnay, too. Yum!

Just made this and can't wait to have it with Thanksgiving dinner!  I did cut back the sugar to about 3/4 cup, and I added a cinnamon stick and one vanilla bean, as well.  Wow, this will be phenomenal over ice cream at a later date, too!  :)

Excellent! I used this to teach my son a simple dish and some cooking basics. My whole family (including extended family) loves it and now they request it from my son each Thanksgiving! We started adding 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg for personal preference.

I am not a big fan of cranberry sauce, but my family likes it, so... it has to be done. I just can't bring myself to try the can-shaped thing, so I tried out this recipe a few years ago. It is pretty good, and family likes it, so it is a win. The only thing I do differently is that once the sugar is dissolved, I turn the heat very low, and let it cook slowly for about an hour. I check on it every 5-10 minutes or so, to stir and smoosh the cranberries. It's also one of those things you can make a few days ahead, to alleviate the cooking load on the actual holiday.

You can achieve kid-approved (and can-shaped cranberry jelly loving in-laws) homemade cranberry sauce with this recipe by simply straining the cooked sauce through a strainer while hot, pressing the pulp to be sure to get everything (I strain it into my serving dish and refrigerate overnight). It comes out perfect EVERY time, and I've been making this recipe for 4 years. A couple of tips: you must cook this way past the "popping stage" to achieve a smooth and jelled sauce. Cook until the sauce becomes dark red through and through and begins to thicken on its own. I also add about a 1/4 cup more sugar to cut the tartness for my kids. The first year I made this, my mother-in-law still brought a can of cranberry sauce thinking she and my father-in-law wouldn't like it, but it was a hit. No more can-shaped cranberry jelly at our Thanksgiving table! (I've also doubled the recipe and at times added the Grand Mariner - perfect and delish!)

Substitute sweet vermouth or another liqueur for the orange juice. Most of the alcohol cooks out but it leave a nice kick.

Using all orange juice caused the flavor to be "off"... I have tried it both ways, using all OJ and using all water, and the water/sugar/cranberries way is the best. You do not have to put a lot of OJ in your cranberry sauce but if you like orange, maybe some zest or a teaspoon of OJ.

Very good and very easy.  It was really runny though, even though I let it cook extra time then set in the refrigerator a while.  If I do it again, I'll probably reduce the juice.  I like the sweetness of this recipe though.

This is a good and simple recipe.  But I use 1 cup of water instead of orange juice.  Once the mixture is cool, I add a tbsp or two of orange liquor such as Grand Marnier.

The first time I made this, I didn't realize until after the stores were closed, that all I had was a citrus blend of juice so I figured, why not? Greatest cranberry sauce ever! I followed the recipe to a t other than that and I will never buy canned sauce again.

This was great and easy! I had always turned away from my Dad's store-bought canned cranberries, but I wanted cranberries as a tradition on the table and this was amazing. My mom and Iblove them and she was another hold out.

Had to make this a little different then the recipe calls for. Could not find fresh cranberries so went with dried. Went with 1 1/2 cups orange juice and a splash of water. Added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg and a little orange zest. Turned out wonderful to me really sweet. Wife is a fan of the can stuff so she liked it but it was not the same. Next time think I will put it in the blender then chill for a few hours in a jello mold to get that jelly likeness that she enjoys.

I tried this for the first time at Thanksgiving and it turned out great! However I did split up the sugar using 1/2 cup of brown and 1/2 cup white sugar each instead. I also added a touch of nutmeg. I will definitely be making this again for Christmas!

Everyone loved this at Thanksgiving, and it was very easy. I added a small amount of freshly grated orange peel. It thickened up nicely, in fact I may have let it thicken too much before taking it off the stove - it sets up even more when it cools.

perfect! my only thought is, make sure you smash the berries a bit, and cook them a tad longer. that way it firms up a bit more. mine was more juicy than i liked. But great reviews from my family! i'm 14 and i had to make thanksgiving by myself. first time i've ever made cranberry sauce and it was easy and perfect! definite keeper! :)

Been doing this on for a couple of years now - to cut back on the sugar - I add 1/2 cup of sugar. Only additions - I add some cloves and cinnamon.  I make it the night before and put in fridge to thicken up.

This cranberry sauce was very good and I don't like cranberry sauce!!  I even served it over a block of cream cheese as an appetizer and everyone really liked it.

This was my first try at homemade cranberry sauce and it was excellent!  I let it cook a little longer and mashed some of the berries. It was nice and thick. Not going back to canned sauce.

This is an excellent recipe. I used half brn sug/white sug and had to cook it way longer than instructed to get it to hold its shape a bit. I'd encourage all to rinse the fresh cranberries in a strainer and pick out the leaves and mushy ones. Maybe it's common sense to some, but this was my first time making cranberry sauce and I nearly just threw the cranberries in straight from the bag. I was surprised how many yucky ones there were. Also, the longer I let it cook, the richer the flavor became. Can't wait to dig in tomorrow! Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

I will never buy canned sauce again! This was my first time making homemade cranberry sauce & this was very easy. After it cooked for 10 minutes like the recipe says, I took a potato masher & gave it a few mashes & cooked it for a few more minutes as others have suggested. Came out perfect!

Made this for Thanksgiving today. Soooo good. I did the half brown sugar, half white sugar and doubled the recipe. I added a little cinnamon (about 1/2 teaspoon) and it gave it just a little extra flavor. It is sooooo good. I don't normally care for the canned cranberry sauce, but I didn't want to stop eating this one. I had to seal it in my canning jars to keep away from it.  Definately will make it again. Super easy, took about 15 minutes from start to finish. I used a potato masher to smash the cranberries for a smoother consistency.

Awesome!  Many juices work, as does the addition of any berry and most nuts.  Tailor to your own tastes!  Very simple.  I used apple and pineapple juice and added walnuts to mine.  Came out great.

I concur with other reviewers: use half white sugar and half brown sugar. It was a little runny, so I now use extra pulp orange juice and cook it for about 5 extra minutes, and now it's perfect. Best to make it the day of or the day before, because the longer it sits it starts to lose some of the cranberry tang and gets sweeter.

I have always liked the canned cranberry sauce but I have seen the light!  I made this recipe last year and it was a huge hit and I will be making it again on Thursday.  It is perfect as-is.  If you want it a little less chunky, I'd recommend squeezing the berries against the edge of the pan with your spoon/spatula/whatever to smush them.  I probably cooked it for longer than 10 minutes doing that but it didn't suffer for it.  Delicious!

Awesome sauce! Perfect balance on sweet and sour. It does thicken as it cools down. I was a little reluctant to try it when I saw orange juice in the ingredient list but it turned out perfect. I will never buy canned cranberry sauce again as long as I can find cranberry. I used half white sugar and half yellow sugar. I will try using honey or agave next time.

I love this! I will be using this as my "go to" cranberry recipe from now on.  In fact, I have made it several times since Thanksgiving.  I like to eat it by itself if I don't have cream cheese and turkey for a sandwich.  I've passed the recipe along to all my Sisters. I highly recommend this recipe . I grate orange zest onto the top to garnish it.

When prepared as written, the result was the consistency of simple syrup, even after refrigerating overnight. I dumped it back into a saucepan and simmered it for a couple of hours (which was probably overkill), then popped it back into the fridge for an hour, and the final result was as thick as the whole berry canned variety and delicious to boot! Next time, I'll try halving the orange juice amount as suggested by other comments.

Excellent! I added a little cinnamon, but frankly this recipe needs no changes. My whole family enjoyed this cranberry sauce. Word to the wise: if you cover the saucepan with a lid to limit the splatter, it WILL boil over. Watch it carefully and enjoy.

Great recipe and so easy. Everyone is always so impressed that I made cranberry sauce, instead of just opening a can...they don't realize that it is only 3 ingredients. I do cook it for about 45 minutes so that most of the berries have popped and are cooked down.

As others had done, I also incorporated a number of suggestions from others.  Used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown, used 1/2 cup of orange juice and slightly less than 1/2 cup of water and also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It was so good with the meal, on the turkey sandwiches later and also in the morning mixed in with our oatmeal.  It was so good, that I am making another batch, so we can continue to enjoy it with our oatmeal in the mornings.

Followed advice of others and did half brown half white sugar,put a cinnamon stick in and some cloves and it still seems like it was missing that WOW factor for me. I made it the day before and put into the fridge and it was perfectly thick. People did like this a lot.

I typically spend Thanksgiving at a family members house but this year, it was up to me to prepare the Thanksgiving meal and I wanted to do everything from scratch so I gave this recipe a shot and opted out of the canned sauce.  It was a total hit and now - days later - I'm having to remake it so that the leftovers can linger.  Love it, love it, love it.

This recipe has a fantastic flavor.  I used fresh-squeezed orange juice and organic cane sugar.  Definitely cook it longer than 10 minutes.  Mine was somewhat watery.  Could be the altitude here in Ft. Collins, but next time I'll cook it until it thickens somewhat in the pan before I let it sit.

Very Delicious. I only give it 4 stars since I tweeked some. I followed some reviews of others and did a 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar. And at the end of the cooking period I sprinkled some cinnamon over the top and stirred it in as well. I, like others, feel I will never go back to canned sauce again. I agree it makes a great spread on the yeast rolls as well. I did cook and stir mine at least 10 minutes longer to get a noticeably thicker sauce. I just hope I find cranberries through out the year as this needs to be eaten year round!

I am not a big fan of reviews of recipes that have been altered because it doesn't really give a review of the original recipe. That being said, I didn't have any orange juice when I started making this recipe, but I did have some "Cuties". I peeled three of these little guys, and boiled them in about 1/4 cup of water. After removing the casings, I peeled another one, cut it up and threw it in. This seemed to make a great substitute for the orange juice, and the final result was amazing.

Hi, Yes I went with the half brown and half white sugar. I mashed the cranberries while cooking then as suggested I added a dash of cinnamon. I then placed them in the blender for two quick pulses. They are setting in the fridge right now but the taste is fantastic. It is so easy, why but canned ever again?

I doubled this recipe with 24 ounces of frozen whole raw cranberries, 2 cups of white sugar, and only 1 cup of orange juice (in other words I did not double the liquid).  It turned out perfect.  I little grated orange rind adds a nice zing too.

I am not a cranberry fan. But this recipe was very tasty! Since some reviewers have stated it can be too runny, I dried the berries after rinsing them. Then, after they were fully cooked, I dipped out the berries and continued to cook the sauce for another 5 minutes to thicken it. I also used half white sugar, half brown. Wonderful recipe!

I made the recipe with 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white sugar and  the 1 c orange juice. I Simmered it for the recomended 10 minutes. It's still warm and I cant keep my spoon out of it. It's thickening as it cools and the berries mashed up nicely. Sweet then tart flavor, I LOVE IT. I made it today because I wanted a trial run before I set the table for 20 people on Thanksgiving Day. I will definately make a bowl of this cranberry sauce and i'll also have on hand some canned sauce for the die hards.  I'm going to try grape juice the next time, has anyone tried that?

I use this recipe all the time. I use less sugar (1/2) though and add cinnamon sticks and cloves. I buy bags of cranberries during the holiday season and put them in the deep freezer for later in the year. It's wonderful to eat all year round and with less sugar it's quite low in calories. I add it to my vanilla yogurt.

This recipe does not work if you follow it precisely. If you remove as soon as they have started to pop, it will not set. I left it over night and still had liquid in the morning. Looked up several other recipes, and ALL of them say to boil the berries. This was a complete waste of my time, hoping it wasn't a waste of my food, too!

I'm not sure I would make this again.  It was incredibly tart; maybe I'm just used to the canned stuff.

I used about 3 cups of cranberries, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 cup oj, and 1/2 cup gran marnier. I am not a fan of too sweet and I think next time I will use 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup agave.

I used the juice of one orange and the zest. I also added chopped pecans which gave it a satisfying crunch! It was so good that I ate a cup of it by itself!

I've made this recipe for years but through the years have wanted more so in my experimentation, I have ended up doubling the recipe (there's never enough for the sandwiches and take home for guests. I also add a splash of vanilla, grated orange zest and the juice of 2 oranges (grand marnier can be expensive and the zest n juice does well in a pinch) and about 1 tsp of honey which gives it a little more depth and richness. Great as it is, but fun to experiment. Everyone loves it.

I don't like a lot of citrus in my cranberry sauce and so I used 1/2 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup water. I also used a hand held blender leaving about half of the berries whole. It turned out totally fabulous.

I tried this after reading through many of the reviews and made a few of the suggested adjustments.  I used 1/2 C orange juice, 1/2 C pineapple juice, and 1/2 granulated and 1/2 brown sugar. I had pineapple chunks so after draining the juice, I pureed about 1/2 C in the blender and cooked it with the cranberries, added a little allspice and 1/4 t cinnamon.  It is the best I have ever tasted.

So yummy....so easy.  Quick!  It's sweet and tart....perfect.  I added a 2 cups cranberries and a little cinnamon.  Don't walk away....if the juice overflows, it's a mess to clean up...very sticky.  This is a lot easier than opening a can of cranberry sauce!

I have made this recipe three years in a row. I love it because it's quick, easy, and tasty. The cranberries are so pretty with the varying reds. Then all you need is sugar (I did half brown and half red) and orange juice, which I always have on hand. Some people add spices (like cinnamon), and I tried this one year, but I prefer the simple version of orange and cranberry. Add a little orange (or clementine!) zest on top and it's a perfect Thanksgiving side dish.

This sauce is so good I can't wait to serve it to my guests on Thanksgiving Day! I made it 2 days ahead; going to keep it in the fridge until about a half hour before serving. I mashed the cranberries against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon and I got a beautiful thick sauce. I only used 3/4 cup of OJ, following everything else to a T

This recipe was my starting off point.  I use half white and half brown sugar; a pinch of cinnamon; 1 T cornstarch and 1/8 c Grand Marnier.  When I told my brother that I was changing the recipe, he had a fit.  Then he tasted it and loved it.

I made this for our company Thanksgiving luncheon 2 years ago and it was such a big hit that it now a staple on my table for Thanksgiving.  Easy and fun to make but MESSY!  And everyone loves it.  I followed the recipe, don't usually do well when breaking off the recipes. (That's why I use allrecipes.com.)

Very good and very easy to make.  Instead of using all sugar I used half white sugar and half splenda.  Also I used Trop50 so it had even less sugar.

Best cranberry sauce I've ever had. Made it exactly as described. I would suggest making it the day before and letting it cool and set up in the fridge overnight. It has a brighter, more intense orange flavor when you first make it but the orange mellows a bit by the next day. I love it! It's fresh and delicious and the cranberries are tender and chewy. I'll never buy canned again.

Such an easy recipe!  I don't even understand why anyone would even consider using the canned stuff when this can be whipped up in a jiffy.  I added a dash of nutmeg.  Next time I'll try adding cinnamon and orange zest.  Fantastic!  Thanks so much!!

I used natural tangerine juice, which is what I had, but next time will cut the sugar in half. This was just TOO sweet for my taste. I can't modify it anymore because i don't have cranberries or juice left. Oh well, good base though.

Wonderful!! The only thing I did differently was cook it longer than 10 minutes, simply allowing enough time for the cranberries to bloat and fall apart so that there were no whole cranberries left. My family loves it and so do I! It may be sweeter than some cranberry sauces, but I like it that way.

This is really good...however, the first batch I made was runny like a few other comments.  So I made a second batch, used 1/2 c oj only and added about a tsp of jello, once it started boiling even on simmer, I added my 'runnier' batch, some vanilla and 3 cloves.  Cooked for 15 minutes and know I have a nice consistency and GRAND cranberry 'sauce'.  I would have used plain gelatin if I had it, but only had strawberry.  Still a big hit with the family.

This is simple and good, a classic flavor combination. I tasted it at the end and added pumpkin pie spice to taste, because we usually have allspice and cloves in our cranberry sauce and I missed it here (but loved the orange juice -- I usually don't use that!). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and this was so easy and to my husband and guest it was so very good; but to me the orange juice seems to be a bit over powering.  The next time I will use just a half a cup of orange juice, but I will never buy the can sauce again.  BTW I add dried cranberries while it was cooking.

These were way too liquidy. Next time I'd use maybe half the orange juice. The liquid didn't thicken as I thought it would. They tasted fine, but this cranberry soup was definitely the outcast on the Thanksgiving table. Surprising for such a highly rated recipe.

Thank you for this recipe! I don't generally care for cranberry sauce, but this was delicious! My mother-in-law loved it!  It was a bit thinner than I expected, but after years of tinned sauce I don't think I knew just what to expect!
UPDATE: made this again this year and it is even better than I remembered! The key is letting the cranberries boil for quite some time... I think I left them for 20 minutes! The longer they simmer, the thicker it gets!

This was soooo yummy and easy to make! Thank you! Even the skeptics were coming back for seconds and thirds.  I used fresh oranges and 1 c. sugar as the recipe calls for (I recommend it over using orange juice, more flavor and less added sugar).  Also added a splash/1/4 c. of white wine since I didn't have orange flavored liquor and it gave it a nice touch.  Highly recommend!

Very good, classic cranberry sauce.  Tip: if you let the mixture simmer gently for 10 full minutes after the cranberries pop, it will thicken & gel nicely as it cools.

So incredibly good and easy.  I cooked for MUCH longer than the recipe called for and squished the reduced cranberries for a smoother texture.  Even my mom, who typically despises cranberry sauce, liked it. Kudos.

Delicious!  Simple recipe, but very tasty - even a few days after Thanksgiving.  Adding orang zest might be an interesting variation too.

My first experience with homemade cranberry sauce---it was perfect! Didn't change too much...scaled down for two servings and substituted some light brown sugar for the white. This is good on its own, with sweet potatoes, or any kind of veggie. I don't eat meat too often, but can imagine it being good with chicken, turkey, or even steak. After dinner, I had some with the apple crumb pie I made. Yum!

I was dubious of even trying this as someone who has grown up on canned, jellied cranberry sauce, but it was quite yummy.  We made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone who dared to try it had more than one helping.  We halved the orange juice, but still found the flavor to be a little strong.  We made a double batch, which was a LOT.

This cranberry sauce bothered some of my family (they wanted the same old jelly).  However, I thought it was probably the best cranberry sauce I have ever had.  It is also better for you (lower calorie) than traditional canned sauce.  I boiled my cranberries for closer to 20 minutes and then mashed them with my potato masher.  They were the perfect thick consistency.

This recipe is replacing my previous cranberry sauce recipe. It's perfectly sweet. I used 3/4 C OJ and then added 1/4 C Grand Marnier in the last few minutes of cooking.

I'm not sure what happened with my attempt at this sauce but my family said it was just too tart--maybe the product of using fresh cranberries? Probably won't be making this again.

This is the best cranberry sauce I have made and it was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I have tried a few recipes for cranberry sauce and this is the one that was the biggest hit.  I took the advice and use 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar.  I also advise of Liza and added the raspberries, crushed pineapples, crushed pecans, and grand marinier.  It was perfect!  You definitely have to make it the night before to let the flavor marry. I will make this a permanent staple at my Thanksgiving dinners.  Thank you!

I read many reviews before making and reduced the amount of orange juice to about  ¾ cup and  balanced with water. I also did a 50/50 with brown sugar and regular granulated sugar. When I first made it I thought it had a really strong citrus flavor and I didn’t like it but the next afternoon I tried it at Thanksgiving it had really balanced out and was a huge hit. I love that you can make this a few days ahead. I recommend making this the day before for flavor.

We all loved this, although I would say it was a bit on the sweet side, might use less sugar less time. I did go with 1/2 brown sugar as well and I will do so again although I might use a little less overall.

Very tart and tasty.  Really easy, there's no reason to use the canned stuff any more.  After it cooled I pureed it in the blender because I didn't like the chewy skin.  Turned out really well and a beautiful color.

After reading other reviews, I used half white sugar and half brown and mashed about half of the cranberries with the back of a spoon while they were in the pan.  This was DELICIOUS... tastes similar to the canned version, only better and so much fresher.  Yum!

Followed the recipe exactly, but I mashed some of the cranberries to make it a little thicker. It was better than I could have ever imagined! My family has always used canned cranberry sauce, but after this it's impossible to ever go back!

Great recipe.  I did mix it up a little though.  With just one cup of sugar it was still a little too tart for my liking, this could have been because of the cranberries not being perfectly ripe, but i added almost another cup, maybe 1 and 3/4 cup total of sugar.  I also cooked it a tad longer so it would be a little more thick.  Also, just for aesthetics, i put the mixture in 4 separate white creme brulee dishes and put a little mint leaf in each one.  It looked fantastic.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and tasted it warm.  OMG!!!  So delish!!  The only thing I did add was one can of jellied cranberry sauce right at the end and stirred it in until melted, just to help thicken it.  So simple and elegant.  Think I'll sprinkle it with a few walnuts just prior to serving.

Just finished making this for the first time.  Easy and delicious!  Perfect balance of sweet and tart.    Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar as many others suggested.  Who knew cranberry sauce was so easy?  No more canned stuff for us!

Extremely easy to make, and tastes thousand times better than any canned cranberry sauce. I was afraid it was a little to sweet, but everyone disagreed and said it was prefect!

The orange flavor in this was a little too strong for my taste.  The cranberry sauce did thicken some, but not as much as I would have liked.  I think next time I try this I will use less liquid.

This was simple and delicious. As per other reviewers, I added Grand Marnier. I made a double batch so I used 1/4 c. Grand Marnier, 2 c. OJ (Grove Stand Simply Orange), 24 oz. fresh cranberries, almost 1 c. Organic sugar, and a bit over 1 c. organic brown sugar, and my husband had me add 1 tsp. allspice. This is soooooo good! Thank you.

This sauce is pretty delicious, although it is VERY sweet! I suspected it was going to be sweet, so I used 1/2c. brown sugar and 1/4c. white sugar, and also reduced the orange juice by 1/4c. Still pretty sweet. I'm not sure if I just had particularly sweet cranberries or what, but if you're looking for a tart and tangy sauce, this isn't the one for you! Aside from the sweetness, the taste is really very good and it set up nicely. I put half the batch in the foodprocessor for a couple of pulses and mashed the rest with the back of a spoon for a nice consistency.  Also added 1/4tsp. of cinnamon and 1tb. of Galliano. It was really good...I think I might add a little lemon or orange zest just to cut the sweetness a little.  It does seem like it would be amazing on toast or muffins though...like a yummy cranberry jam!

Wow! This was incredibly easy to make and it went over well as a basic staple for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I can see making this recipe throughout the year and using it as a topping over pancakes, a filling for cake or ice cream topping. The color makes for an impressive presentation.

I did it as posted, and it was a bit on the runny side, so just got to cook it longer / let it set. Also had one say it was a bit too sour due to the orange juice. So I will likely lessen that next time as well. But for a quick and simple recipe it tastes much better then the can stuff anytime.

5* for simplicity - 4* for taste (just a tad bit on the overly sweet side).  Will definitely make again, just without so much sugar.  Try cutting in half (?) or do the brown sugar substitute (?) TY so much for recipe. UPDATE:  Made this again this year and took advise of others to make it a day ahead of time so the flavors could mellow.  What a HUGE difference!  Everyone raved!

Great recipe for those that like the canned cranberry sauce!  My husband loves (or thought he did) the canned stuff, but I still wanted to try to make it from scratch.  I doubled the recipe and added an additional cup of white sugar and cup of orange juice.  I don't recommend this step unless you have a sweet tooth.  I took out about 2 cups of cranberries (once they were cooked) and the juice and pureed it.  I then added it back to the rest of the dish.  It turned out wonderful!  My husband admits that he liked it a lot better than the canned stuff!

I've made this at least 3 times now for my family and they LOVE it. It's ridiculously easy and everyone is impressed at homemade cranberry sauce! I let it boil away on the stove until it looks thick enough, definitely more than the time recommended. 20 minutes maybe?

I followed the other reviewers, adding 1/4 tsp cinnamon and splitting the 1 cup sugar between white and brown sugar. Considering that my family and I never go near cranberry sauce, everyone tried it this year and enjoyed it. I even spooned some over "Aunt Johnnie's Pound Cake" that I got off of this site, which is a real triumph for cranberries everywhere. My only complaint is that it's not as thick as I was expecting. Maybe next time I'll add some flour or corn starch to give it a thicker consistency.

Very nice and simple recipe.  I made this recipe after losing a cranberry relish recipe that I found elsewhere (it contained golden raisins with the cranberries).  I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the full cup and still tasted sweet enough.  I'll still search for my original relish recipe, but will make this one until I find it!

I used Splenda instead of sugar and it needs probably 1 and 1/2 cups of that to make it sweet enough.

So easy and very delicious. I made this the day before with fresh orange juice; the orange flavor was overpowering after preparing it, but eating it the next day, it tasted great. Just make sure you mix it up before serving.

My family loved this.  My husband told me to never buy the canned again.  I did cut down on the liquid some since others said it was a little runny.  Came out perfectly...will definitely make this for Christmas this year.

I had never made cranberry sauce before, always used canned, but never again! My husband and mother in law loved this and they like cranberry sauce. My daughter hates the canned stuff but said this was delish! I took the leftover sauce and mixed it with cream cheese (my hubby's idea) for turkey sandwiches and they went nuts! Thanks for a great recipe.

So easy that I agree with others- no need to buy the canned stuff again.  I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon which I thought was a nice touch.  I simmered for about 12 min.  Don't obsess over the time- just keep simmering and stir every couple of minutes until they are the consistency you like.    I recommend making the day before and refrigerating overnight.  They set up nicely this way.

This cranberry sauce is fabulous. I have never attempted making my own and I will never go back to store bought after trying this. It was so easy to make. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and the zest of 1 orange, I cooked it for 25 - 30 minutes to make it thicker.

Wonderful! After reading the reviews, I cooked the cranberries a little longer to give the sauce some extra thickness. It worked very well and was super easy. Great to make ahead!

Awesome!  So unbelievably easy and delicious. My husband will not stop raving about the cranberries and we chuckled when I pointed out that one of his favorite dishes out of all of them were the cranberries! Even my 1 1/2 year old daughter couldn't stop eating them!  Will make year and year from now on.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used half brown sugar and added a sprinkle of cinnamon. My husband said it was the best cranberry sauce he'd ever had! This recipe is very easy, delicious and was a nice addition to our Thanksgiving meal.

Loved it!  My cranberries "popped" before 10 minutes so I just lowered the heat and continued to cook and thicken the sauce the full 10 minutes. I also used another reviewers tip and mashed the cranberries as they popped with the back of a spoon.  This will be a regular at holidays now!

I embarassed that I ever bought canned cranberry juice. Made it just as the recipe called for. Might do 1/2 OJ and 1/2 water next time, and I cooked it for maybe 15 minutes for a thicker sauce as suggested in other reviews. I made it ahead of time for Thanksgiving, so put it in the freezer until then. Never again will I buy the canned stuff.

This was so nice and simple. I did add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the mixture. Nice mix of tangy and sweet. The orange juice didn't overpower the cranberries. Gelled up nicely.

I'm glad I came across this recipe.  I needed to find something that would be fast and great tasting.  I only had half a bag of cranberries left and so I scaled the recipe down.  I added some orange zest, 1 tbs. orange Marmelade and about 6 whole cloves.  The result was delicious.  Thanks Toni.

5 Stars for this cranberry sauce!  I will NEVER buy canned again, it's just that good.  This was super easy, and set up just like the jelled canned version, only tastes 100% better!  The orange juice, rather than water like other recipes, really makes the difference here.  Per other reviews, I made in advance on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to let the flavors blend together.  My mother in law was so impressed with this, she went home with the recipe...and that's saying a LOT! My husband was licking it off the spoon right out of the pan! The cranberries do "pop" as they soften, and I used my potato masher to mash them but left some of the berries only half mashed to give it a good texture.  Perfect!  Thanks so much for this recipe, I will continue to use it and make people think I slaved!  :)

This was my first attempt to make cranberry sauce. It was amazingly simple and delicious. I spent only 15 minutes in front of the stove! I am now wondering why ever bothered to eat canned cranberry sauce. 

Some reviewers have said it was too runny. So I cut the orange juice down to 1/2 a cup. However, I soon found it needed more liquid. I added another 1/4 cup to thin it out. So personally, I would put the whole cup of juice into the sauce at the start, and then keep it on the heat until it reaches the desired consistency.

Very yummy and very easy!  Won't add to your Thanksgiving day stress!  Based on a Thanksgiving show on the Food Network, I modified this recipe.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and the zest of one orange which I shaved off with a veggie peeler, then fished out later.  I want it again for Christmas!

For perfect "jelly": use 1/4 c. Grand Marnier, 3/4 c. OJ, 1 c. white sugar, a pinch of cinnamon, pinch of ginger. Cook for 25-30 mins. mashing berries while they cook. Press through sieve or wire strainer. Firms up nicely and is delicious! Thanks for the start! This is a keeper!

Everyone loved this recipe!  Needed to cook it for 20 minutes, and split the sugar 50/50 white and brown as others have recommended. Awesome!

A five star rating to me is one that needs no tweaking of a recipe.  I had to add an additional 3/4 cup of sugar.  The one cup just makes it way to tart!  I must admit that I did receive more compliments one this recipe than on my usual which doesn't include the orange juice.  After the addition of the sugar, it was very good!

I just made this recipe for the second year in a row, and had forgotten how good it is! I can't believe I served the canned cranberries for so long; they are nothing like the real thing in this recipe! It's the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I cooked it for 15 minutes and also helped along the process with a potato masher. I hadn't started it in enough time, so when it cooled off slightly, I put it in the freezer for about a half hour to speed the cooling process, then transferred it to the fridge.  Thanks for this simple but tasty recipe!

WOW is about all I can say.  The easiest ever and the best tasting.  Reminded me of when I was a little girl and Thanksgiving was at Grandma's house.  Try this, you will love it.

Down here in the south we like everything sweet.  I added an extra cup of sugar and a tsp. of vanilla flavoring. The sauce turned out just perfect.  Thanks.

I quadrupled the recipe: 4 bags of cranberries added to 1.5 cans of frozen OJ, 1 cup of water and 1.5 cups of white sugar and brown sugar.  It turned out beautifully.

Excellent!  I used apple juice instead of orange, and added just a squeeze of lemon for some extra citrus flavor... it was great!  Not too sweet.  I recommend cooking it for a bit longer though, otherwise it would have been a bit thin for my taste.  Definetely try this!

Delicious.  I juiced an orange and substituted 1/2 with water.  I also included cinnamon (watch your proportions) and slow cooked for 40 minutes to evaporate liquid.  Used pure maple syrup, too. YUM!

What I like about this recipe is it can be used as a base for modification. In place of the orange juice, I used another juice high in antioxidants, Pomegranate juice! While it cools add 1/4 cup of orange cognac. Chill in frig for a day. My husband likes it just by itself during the cold and flu season...about 1/4 cup a day. In most regions cranberries are only sold during the holidays; so I stock up and keep the packages in the freezer.

Best Cranberry Sauce Recipe I've made!  So easy and looks beautiful with the whole cranberries. Was a bit worried when I first made it that it was too runny but once it set in the fridge for a few hours it was perfect.

I'm not a huge fan of cranberry sauce but I thought this was pretty good.  It was simple to make and looked so much better than canned.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because nobody seemed to really eat it on Thanksgiving.  I guess it's possible that the people I had over just didn't like cranberry sauce though.

Excellent!  Added some dried orange peel.  Made this a 2nd time with 1/4 cup fresh oj as part of the liquid and a teaspoon or so of vanilla as others suggested.  Now it's a 6 star!

At first I made this exactly as it is written.  WAY to orangey & bitter!!  I tried to fix it by adding cointreau. Booze makes anything better, right? No.  Still too orangey.  Maybe consider 1/2 juice & 1/2 water as previous posters have suggested?  I'll try to find another recipe.

The orange juice added nice flavor combination but was a bit over-powering. Next time, I will take the suggestion of using 1/2c. juice and 1/2c. water.

I doubled it, split the sugar between half white and half brown and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger. I cooked this on lower heat for about 20 minutes.  Fantastic.  My all-time favorite is a similar recipe that has a bit more spice/kick to it (Spiced cranberry sauce with zinfandel from Bon Appetit), but this was quite good.

Great recipe! The first time I made this the 1 c. orange juice was a bit much. The second time I only used 1/2 c. orange juice and 1/2 c. water. No more canned cranberries for our holiday feasts!

I had never made cranberry sauce before, so I was a little nervous. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was so good. I wouldn't change a thing. Everyone raved about it and my kids even ate it plain! I'm adding this to my regular Thanksgiving recipes.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out beautifully!I cooked it the extra 10 minutes and added 1 finely chopped apple. I also added grated orange zest and it really made this cranberry dish stand out. This was very easy and like another reader suggested-would also be yummy as a sandwich spread.

Used 1/2 c white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 c water and 1/2 c OJ and this was perfect.  My family is used to the canned cranberry sauce (which no one really likes) and I was shocked when everyone went back for seconds, even my VERY picky 11 year old son.  Will become a tradition in my house.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very tart, even after doubling the sugar. So to everyone else, maybe sweeten the oj? I "overcooked" mine too, then pureed and put in fridge but it didn't set up any thicker than sour cream. HOWEVER, after setting out several hours, it jelled up like canned. I'm sure that if you "fixed" it up, it's a great recipe. As written though, it was just a disappointment.

This was a huge hit!  Next time I will add less sugar as a personal preference.  Took other's advice and refigerated for two days.

I would give this a 10 if I could.  This was so easy and it came out perfect.  Even my brother who only likes the jellied can ones without any skins kept commenting on how good this cranberry sauce is.  I used half splenda and half brown sugar and I cooked the cranberry sauce for about 30 minutes instead of 10 minutes and added a dash of cinnamon at the end.  Perfect.  Thanks for the recipe Toni.

I love this basic recipe, though I do like to add some orange zest. I also like to take this basic recipe and expand on it to make it my own, but the basic recipe just as it's written is excellent. Just sweet enough, with a little tang. My 4 year old started asking for it as soon as he saw the bags of cranberries in our refrigerator last week and has been counting the days until Thanksgiving just so he can have cranberries. I like to take some of the leftovers, puree it in a food processor, and add some brown sugar and cinnamon to make kind of a "syrup" for waffles and pancakes, and I also love it added along with brown sugar and cinnamon to oatmeal. It is also wonderful served alongside orange muffins.

I love this recipe! I use this one as is, and do a separate one for the non-cranberry lovers in the family. To that one I make the following changes: I use half white and half brown sugar, and add 1 cup of apples that I've diced into approx 1/2 inch pieces and cooked lightly in butter til just softened. Then I add 1/4 t cinnamon. Very yummy!

This sauce was fantastic--I have never made homemade cranberry sauce before. My family always bought the canned kind, which I do not like at all. I will never go back, this was so easy to make and delicious!

Here in Australia cranberries are not so easy to get hold of - recently craisins have appeared, as well as frozen cranberries.  I made this sauce for Christmas with frozen berries, and it was absolutely sensational, and a really different flavour for us.  We were surprised how big the berries were - we were expecting soemthing more like a redcurrant size.  Everyone loved the sauce, and my 9 year old son was very proud he cooked it.  Will make again and again - not just for christmas!

This is quick, easy, and delicious!  I went with some of the other suggestions and cooked the cranberries for 20 min on a lower heat. Also, putting the cranberries over cream cheese was a hit at our christmas party.

I've never cared for cranberry sauce before until now!  This is really delicious...I enjoyed it with my turkey this past Thanksgiving dinner.  Didn't use any gravy at all and I love gravy.  It's also very easy to make.  I will never buy canned cranberry sauce again for my family!  Like suggestions from some reviewers, I made it the day before so it thickened very nicely.  I also added a little bit more sugar and OJ (my family likes things sweet).  Thanks Toni for an awesome recipe!!

Absolutely delicious and so easy you could just forget about it. I used blood orange juice. I made this for English friends when I was in London over Thanksgiving and every one of them took home this simple recipe.

This was delicious! I mashed the cranberries a bit and turned off the heat and left it on the hot burner for a fre more minutes to get the consistency I wanted. Everyone loved it - even those who don't like cranberry sauce. I'm definitely making this one again!

Great cranberry sauce. The difference is the orange juice. Just make sure you make it the night before and let it thicken in the fridge. Next time I would cut down the recipe to a half or even a quarter because I had way too much and had to throw a lot away.

This is great. I made this on Christmas Eve and by the time I served up dinner the following day it had thickened up beautifully. Even people who don't normally like cranberry sauce tried this and said it was good. It does make a lot but I can guarantee it will all go. Thanks

Fantastic!  I added orange zest and added the cranberries at the same time as the sugar and juice.  I also cooked it over a med heat til it thickened because we like a thicker sauce.

I’ve made this cranberry sauce maybe five or six times. This basic recipe is perfectly amazing! I used to eat canned cranberry sauce even out of the can as a dessert when I was a kid; that’s how much I love the stuff... but no cranberry sauce can compare to this recipe!  i’m kind of a free spirit cook so I always add some cinnamon powder cloves but make sure you count how many you put in so you know how many you have to take out

Very easy to make & absolutely delicious! When making, I realized I only had orange-pineapple juice on hand so I used it & the recipe came out great. I put the leftover cranberry sauce in gelatin I was making & everyone loved it!

Did not make any changes...this was great just as is.  Super easy and a big hit with everyone.  Have made it several times now.  Keeps in fridge for days.  We even used it like jelly on biscuits and bagels, and spread it over a block of cream cheese instead of pepper jelly and ate it with crackers! Wonderful!

YUMMM we loved it! I added water instead of orange juice because I wanted the cranberry flavour not orange/ cranberry. I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas it’s is now my go to. Up until now I always used canned

I give mine an extra kick with some grated lemon and orange peel and some nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. Double the recipe and use any leftovers (if you have any) as a topping for some new year's cheesecake. So many regrets for all the time I wasted on canned sauce.

This sauce is awesome!  I had never made homemade cranberry sauce before, but this has sold me!  So easy and very flavorful!  The orange juice gives it a kick that balances the sweetness of the cranberries.  Very good!

So easy, not tart or too sweet. We used 1 cup fresh squeezed orange juice, only because we had a lot. My husband made it for Thanksgiving and will for Christmas as well.

I made with half brown sugar, half regular, and dialed the amount back to keep the tanginess. Never made it before so I added some xanthum gum. Delicious!

This turned out great. I didn’t have orange juice, so I used OceanSpray diet cran-mango cocktail. The color is so bright and it tastes just delicious.

Super easy and very tasty! I used a little less sugar, and swapped out some of the white sugar for brown sugar.  Added a touch of cinnamon.  It was SO good with turkey!

I was going to say 2 stars but opted for 3 because it was edible. Instead of using a name brand OJ, I chose a good store brand. Maybe that was the problem. I knew I had to use more sugar, so I did, but the flavor was still not superb. I won’t be using this recipe again. It didn’t hold up to good old fashioned cranberry sauce.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  I had never made cranberry sauce before, so I read through the comments and opted to incorporate some popular changes. I added half white and half brown sugars, and I threw in a pinch of cinnamon. 
It was absolutely perfect!

This recipe is A-mazing!!!! I never knew cranberry sauce could taste this good. I followed the instructions exactly, the only thing I did was use my potato masher to mash up the cranberries a bit. The sweet and sour balance is perfect. I used to buy canned Oceanspray cranberry sauce.... never again!! This recipe is so tasty and simple, I’m wondering if I can substitute cranberries for maybe blueberries, strawberries, raspberries etc. to make a spread for toast. Delicious!

This was very easy, but I cooked it much longer than instructed.  I added a 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier.  My sugar was 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup of brown.  I  split the recipe into a berry cranberry and a jelled version.  I put 1/2 of it in the blender and pureed the mix.  This did make it a bit more tart than we like, so I put the pureed 1/2 back on the stove with more oj and brown sugar.

This recipe was so incredibly easy to make and it was an absolutely hit with everyone!  It was both a little tart and sweet.  The recipe has already been handed out to some of my guests.  This is definitely a keeper!

Never thought I’d actually like cranberry sauce, but here I am dipping every piece of turkey in this one! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and think it came out perfectly. I made it the night before and it was ready to go for turkey day.

OH MY GOODNESS! Why oh why have I been eating canned Cranberry sauce and worse feeding it to others. I thought I was going to get a thumbs down from my kids for making this, quite the opposite. This will be a new staple at Thanksgiving. I used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, as suggested by some. Delicious. Thank you, Tori.

Never was a big fan of cranberry sauce, but after seeing all the reviews, I had to try this!  I picked and chose some adjustments based on comments.  1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar used (instead of the full 1 cup of white sugar) and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  It came out so good!  Definitely on the sweeter side and reminiscent of a pie filling.  Tasted amazing with the rest of Thanksgiving dinner, and I have so many ideas of what to do with the leftovers!

I forgot about getting cranberry sauce this year, but had a bag of fresh cranberries in the fridge. This recipe was easy, and I had all the ingredients. EVERYONE at the table said it was the best cranberry sauce they’d ever tried. I will NEVER buy canned again!

I think maybe this wasn't as wonderful for me as it was for others since I had to make a large serving (50 people for Thanksgiving-ugh!). Very glad I made it ahead of time.  I had tripled the recipe and hesitated about using all OJ, but the reviews were so enthusiastic, I went for it.  In the large quantity, the orange came through very strongly and not in a good way.  I ended up scooping out half of it and making another batch using plain water, and then mixed that in. Then it was wonderful, and none to take home!

This was delicious!  I swapped 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown as others had suggested and used fresh squeezed orange juice.  Even those that don't normally like cranberry sauce loved it.  I reserved a cup of the leftovers to use as a substitute in a Raspberry Bar recipe I found online.  We are looking forward to eating the rest of the leftovers on turkey sandwiches tomorrow.

Splenda and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  1 medium and 1 small navel orange = 3/4+ cup of juice.  10 0z cranberries.  Sauce filled 1 pint jar.  Perfect.

Easy.  Won't get to taste it till tomorrow, but so far would make it again.

Use 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar. Add some orange zest and pecans for more flavor.

I think this recipe is too sweet, and so I made a few adjustments.  Only used 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of orange juice and 1/2 cup of water.  I also let the sauce simmer longer than the recipe dictates for a thicker texture.    Perfection every  time!

So easy to make and the taste is so much better then canned.  I always use this recipe and add some orange zest but unfortunately, I forgot the orange but it was great anyway. :)

As a non american and non thanksgiving person I have to say I love this cranberry sauce. I always cook for my husband and his family and they actually were surprised it tasted so good since they are canned cranberry jelly people lol. Very good!

Made this last year with some alterations based on reviews. It was great! But I can't remember what I did...

This year, I used 3/4 c OJ and 1/4 Grand Marnier. 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. I also put a pinch of nutmeg and 2-3 pinches of cinnamon. Accidentally bought an 8 oz bag of cranberries instead of 12 oz, so I removed 1/4 c of liquid before putting cranberries in.

Flavor was good. Too sweet, so I probably could have removed a little more liquid and adjusted the sugar/OJ ratio for the smaller bag of cranberries. I think it would have been perfect if I had used the correct amount of cranberries.

I like this recipe, but I make a few simple changes to turn it into one I love!  I only use 2/3 the sugar because the orange juice adds sugar as well.  At the end after I turn the heat off, I add about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract.  It is even good on ice cream!

I added one chopped up apple, used orange juice in place of water,  added raisins, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 1 cinnamon stick. Could possible use a little less sugar because of the raisins. Also added chopped walnuts.

I made this as written last year and everyone really liked it. I find it to be a great base recipe for cranberry sauce. This year I decided to up the game a little. I reduced the orange juice to 3/4 cup + 1/4 cup water and simmered it with the sugar as directed. I added the 12oz bag of fresh cranberries and let them go at it for about 5 minutes, then I added a couple handfuls of blueberries. Toward the end, I added 2 tbsp orange juice concentrate + 1/2 tsp orange extract (this is a substitute for grand marnier, as we don’t really drink alcohol and I don’t cook enough sweet dishes to justify buying a $19 bottle of liquor). I let it all simmer together for a couple more minutes and then stuck it in a dish to cool. I have to say, it is SO good. The blueberries really help cut the tartness of the cranberries and even my 4 year old loves the sauce, and she normally doesn’t like cranberries because of how puckering they can be. I’m going to keep this version around for next year!

Loved it with the changes recommended by other reviewers:  cut back the sugar & do half white and half brown, cook it a little longer (on low) to get the desired consistency, and add a splash of Grand Mariner.  Yum!

This is a great base recipe. I found that I prefer it with brown sugar rather than white and with a bit of orange zest. My family also usually adds a shot of Frangelico or Grand Marnier . Great base to work with though.

Made it Oct 6, 2018, very good, family like it, but they found it somewhat tart. When I  made it oct 2019 I used brown sugar, and apple juice instead, family really like it better. It wasn’t tart.

This was my very first attempt at homemade cranberry sauce and I nailed it! It was so unbelievably easy and is still delicious 3 days later! I followed most reviewers suggestions to use half OJ half water and half white sugar and half brown. I was surprised how quickly the berries popped. I simmered them for 10 min then mashed against side of pan then simmered an additional 5 min. The consistency is nice but not very gelatinous. If you prefer thicker then simmer an extra 5-10 min. I can’t wait to serve this to my guests at Thanksgiving Dinner!

Followed reviewers advice of 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. My first time attempting cranberry sauce. Absolute perfection!  Will become a holiday staple in our house.

Everyone raved about the sauce! Will definitely make again. 
Made a few adaptions: 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup fresh unpasteurized orange juice. 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar. Pinch of salt. Couple splashes of lemon juice. Cooked longer then 10 minutes; cooked till most had burst but not all (verge of popping)

Agreed, I’m not sure the cup of orange juice is essential. 
My few adjustments were: water not O.J.,¼ tsp ground ginger & cinnamon + 3 “good grinds” of black pepper. 
You CANNOT taste the pepper, but it subtly boots the flavour of the ground spices.

Double the recipe, split the sugar between half white and half brown and add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Can let cook an extra 10 min for thicker product. While they are boiling give them a good mash or two with potato masher for perfect consistency. For a little more flavor, add only 3/4 of a cup of orange juice and after it is cooked add 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier.

Yeah I made this... sooo good... I am type 2 diabetic so I cut the sugar in half, next fall I will cut that in half again I do love the tart taste... I used Tropicana orange juice but have learned they use aborted infant parts known as Senomyx so I will use fresh squeezed juice

I've made this several times, and each time it turned out excellent.  The first several times, I made it as written.  The last time, I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers by adding 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier at the end.  I liked it better.  Thank you Toni for sharing this marvelous recipe.

I used about 1/4 cup less of sugar, and used cane sugar instead.  It was great!  Simple and tart, not too sweet.

The sauce was good but way too sweet so I added an extra cup of water, a tablespoon of corn starch (no stores were open so I couldn't use another bag of fresh cranberries) and for a fun twist a 1/4 of freeze dried ginger. At our pot luck I had a few women come and ask me for my recipe :D

I just made this to put in fridge for Christmas Eve dinner.  I've made a variation with 50/50 orange juice and water before.  I had 2lbs of cranberries so I made the following tweaks:
2lbs Cranberries, washed
20oz orange juice (not covering cranberries, about an inch below coverage)
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1-1.5 tsp grated orange zest (using microplane aka fine grater)
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Brought to a boil in a wide pot, then lowered to med-high and continued to lower temp as it thickened, continuing to low boil until it was getting close to the thickness I wanted then I used a potato masher in the pot as it cooked.  Once it got thick I turned off heat and let it cool.  Very thick and great taste.  It has a slight sweetness but still tart, sort of like a marmalade, which I like.  Lots of orange flavor so if you don't want that I would use half water and half orange juice and leave out the orange zest which is what I did last year and that gives just a hint of orange flavor.

My first attempt at home made cranberry sauce and a trial run for the Christmas table.   As suggested by others, I used orange juice however I used 1/2 fresh squeezed and 1/2 water and added a bit of orange zest. I also used have white and brown sugar.   Tart and sweet, delicious.

Simple is better and I love this cranberry sauce. I have made it a couple times and I find that cutting the sugar down and simmering the sauce for twice as long creates a slightly  more bitter and gel like sauce which is what I like more for myself.

I did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, reduced OJ to 3 oz and and added 1 oz Gran Marnier and  1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.  My boiling time was a little greater than 10 mins. I waited until all the cranberries were popped before removing from heat. Mine jelled perfectly and tasted delicious!

Excellent!  Don't be intimidated.  This is a really easy recipe.  Puts store bought jellied cranberry sauce to shame, and has no bad ingredients in it.    I didn't have any OJ, so used water and added a bit of orange oil that I use for baking.  Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 white, and 1/2 brown cane sugar, although used a little less than 1c because I don't care for super sweet.  Balanced out the tartness of the cranberries nicely.   Hand mashed it, but if your a "texture person", you could easily place in a blender (be careful if the mixture is hot when you do this!)  Added about 1/8c of Grand Marnier, and instead of cinnamon, I grated some fresh nutmeg.  The sauce sets up nicely, and makes a nice home made gift, which is what I am doing with the jars.

I love fresh cranberry sauce.  I’ve made this every Christmas and Thanksgiving for the last 5 years.  The only change I make is I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.

Very similar to a friends of mine but much more simple! The only difference with the other one is the rind of a lemon and orange. Maybe some cinnamon if you want it - but may be over kill. Thanks!

This was delicious! I did not have any orange juice on hand so I threw 3 peeled clementines in the food processor to make juice (I halved the recipe). Did everything else as per recipe, and following the reviews added a sprinkle of cinnamon and dried orange zest. AMAZING!!!

excellent! everyone at thanksgiving dinner raved over the cranberries. Thank you for the recipe!  I followed the suggestion of the "most helpful" reviewer (splitting the sugars between half white and half brown, adding cinnamon, etc.).  i also doubled the recipe for our group and there was enough to go around and have everyone take some as leftovers :)

One of my all-time favorites. I'm never going back to those canned gelatinous cylinders. Just added two cinnamon sticks, as recommended by another reviewer, and all was well. Now if I can only find fresh cranberries year-round??

This was awesome however I did change it up a bit due to the sugar content. I substituted regular orange juice for Trop 50 with pulp. I also used 1/2 the sugar. Came out amazing and actually had to make a second batch. Simple recipe and please don’t poison your guests with that much sugar. It’s not necessary. Would do it again easily

Easy recipe to make.  I followed the recipe as written.  It was flavorful and not too tart.  Everyone who tried it also enjoyed the hint of orange with the cranberries.

Overall this recipe was good.  This was the first time making fresh cranberry sauce. I will be making this every thanksgiving from now on. The only thing I will change is that it needs to be a little sweeter.

Wow! this is fantastic. I did not change the recipe and it turned out great! I made it for my family because I do not like cranberries. But I will have to say I am a huge fan of this. Try it very simple to make.

I really liked this recipe because of it's simplicity. Delicious!

I had never bought fresh cranberries before. I thought they were like other berries so I brought home a 3 pound bag. Well after biting in to a few different shades of them I realized they are most definitely NOT like other berries! So I came looking for a recipe where I wouldn't need to buy many new ingredients.

This cranberry recipe was exactly what I needed! We ended up putting this on top of our panna cotta for Thanksgiving. In other batches we also mixed in strawberries, kiwis, bananas and it works really well with everything! 

Thank you for sharing this with us!

New cooks don't be thrown off by that early taste test. I was disappointed when all I tasted was the orange juice. Once the sauce cooled off it was excellent and just what I imagined.

Cut the sugar in half. Still very good but may cut the juice in half with water next time since I like the tartness of cranberries.

Delicious, I don't usually like home made cranberry sauce but this was so good. I added a bit of cinnamon and pureed it just a bit with my hand mixer. It was a hit on Thanksgiving.

I swapped the orange juice for apple cider and added a diced orange, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cloves. I thickened it with 1/4 orange juice and 1 Tblsp corn starch. I like to put it on turkey sandwiches. Without thickening it tends to dribble out.

I added just a dash of nutmeg... perfection! 
This cranberry sauce recipe finally got my mother to skip opening a can of the cranberry jelly...I consider that a raging success!  I make it every year now..
Btw.. it's great with pork dishes a well!

Excellent recipe!  I halved the sugar to 1/2 cup as we have diabetic family members.   Very simple and delicious with the cranberry flavor the star of this recipe.

Delicious! So simple to make I wonder why anyone buys it canned. Woke up Thanksgiving morning to find the first ripe oranges of the season on my tree so decided to give this a try. I did cut sugar in half for a more tart and crisp flavor as well as added some orange zest. First time there was no leftover cranberry sauce!

This is an incredible recipe. My family absolutely loves it, In fact, I made it for 2018 Thanksgiving and by popular request, a second batch the next day to go with leftovers!! I split between brown and white sugar. I also add 1 Granny Smith apple and reduce about 10 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. A fun thing to do is use a bundt cake mold and place in the fridge. Once set just set the mold in a hot water bath to loosen from the mold and turn upside down onto a plate. I garnish with orange zest.

It was very popular at the Thanksgiving dinner despite being in “competition “ with 2 other offerings. I don’t cook very often, but my husband (who is the cook) really loved it!

Excellent recipe!  I did not change a thing and guests wanted to take some home!  I doubled the recipe for about 15 people.  I also placed it in a small mold overnight in the refrigerator and it was firm and pretty.  Place a few grapes or orange slices around it or in the middle depending on your mold - it looks really nice!

This is the definition of a KISS recipe. It's so simple that that you can't do it wrong and it just works as a great, traditional, cranberry sauce. I can't imagine ever going back to that can of jelly stuff again when this is so good and easy to make

So good!  Followed the recipe as is, just mashed the berries with the back of a spoon as the sauce was cooking.  This thickened beautifully and the flavor got even better after sitting in the fridge for awhile.  I mixed some of the leftovers with softened butter to put on our cranberry walnut bread, and it was amazing.  Can't wait to find more uses for this sauce!

This was a big hit with my family. It was my first time making it. It was so easy! I used 1/2 brown sugar,  half white, and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon as suggest in another review. The only thing I will do different next year is double the recipe!

Great, I followed suggestions and did half brown half white sugar. After cooking, while still hot,  I added the zest of one orange and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Left the orange pulps in and took the cranberry peels out after it’s done. Put it in a mason jar to cool. So that I’ll get the satisfaction when I pour it out like it’s from a can. And people will be tricked into thinking it’s from a can. Then they lose.

I did as others suggested. I substituted Grand Marnier for 1/4 of the orange juice. I also split the sugar, half white and half brown. I added the Grand Marnier just before it finished cooking. Delicious!!

Best Cranberry sauce recipe out there that I've tried. The orange juice really gives this a much more rounded flavor instead of just using water like many recipes do. I've taken it to several work and friends Thanksgiving events over the last few years, and there's rarely any left.

A few slight changes that I make to it. First, I swap out a quarter cup of the OJ for bourbon/Jack Daniels (just needs to be the "big bottle" whiskey, nothing particularly special). Second, I add about 1-1.5 tsp of good cinnamon to the sauce once its finished.

Did as others suggested and did half sugar/half brown sugar, half oj/half water, sprinkle of ground cloves. Only did a half batch since just 2 eating cran, but they loved it. Definitely needed a cover, medium boil x 9 min and it was a great consistency. Thanks, will make again.

This was so sweet it made me bunch up behind the ears!!  I did manage to salvage it by adding a couple or 3 splashes of balsamic vinegar. This was actually pretty genius on my part, if I do say so myself ??.  Not only did it knock down the sweetness a few notches, it also kicked up the beautiful redness of the sauce!  If I make again I will cut the sugar in half!

This is exactly what I was expecting – terrific and easy! After reading the recommendation of others, I cooked the berries for an extra three minutes and added just a tad less of the orange juice.

I'm not sure how many times I've made this, but I pull out the recipe every November for Thanksgiving. Make this and enjoy it!  One reviewer said to add Grand Marnier. Just sub out some of the OJ. Too much and it's overpowering. If you can find the review, follow the instructions.

Don't listen to the people who said this is too sweet! The recipe is Just right . I put  a little less sugar and it needed a little more! Cook it a little longer if yours  is runny .I did and it was
The perfect thickness.

Very good and easy to make.  Just don't let the pot boil over like I did.  I made mine a couple of days ahead.  The taste is very much like tart cherry pie, which has me wondering whether I could use this as a pie filling.

Perfect portioning of ingredients (cranberries in 12 Oz bags, 1 cup each of other ingredients) combined with simple 2 step recipes means no-brainer Thanksgiving recipe.

Spot-on.

Addendum on the third time: made two batches. 1/4 tsp of cinnamon in one batch and 1/4 tsp of ginger in the other added a little punch to counter the rich flavors of the other foods.

Still tastes great.

Excellent! I added 1c orange juice with pulp, 1/2 c water, 4 c berries, 5/8c sugar, and zest of 1/2 orange. 1/2c sugar was not quite enough, and I added a bit more. It's perfect!

This is definitely a classic!  Sometimes people get so caught up wanting to impress and go far beyond basic which is great, but sometimes the simplest recipes are perfect.  

This packs a punch!  I added a little orange zest and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon as one commenter recommended.  I almost don't think I can wait until Thanksgiving to eat it!  

I also doubled the recipe because I know no one is going to have just one serving.

The recipe is definitely great, however take a look at possibly making these simple changes.

When you begin dissolving your sugar in the orange juice

1.  Add 2 cinnamon sticks

2.  Use a fresh orange, first grate off about 2 tablespoons of zest before squeezing the juice from the orange

3.  After adding the cranberries and when the cooking portion is done, remove the cinnamon sticks and begin crushing the cranberries.  

4.  When the cranberries are crushed refigerate.  After the cranberry sauce is cooled off, add the orange zest to the top of the dish.  This will add a nice color and additional flavor.

I realized as I was prepared to make this recipe that I did not have an orange juice in the refrigerator--with some trepidation, I substituted the orange juice with apple cider--you know I thought about cran-apple....so I took a risk.  I also did add in a couple table spoons of lemon juice and 1/3 cup light brown sugar.  And let me say, It's the best cranberry sauce I've ever tasted!  Nothing like what I hated as a child (out of a can).

This was a very tasty, yet simple, recipe. The flavor was on point, yet easy to alter, e.g. cinnamon, orange, whatever. I believe I will be making this every year. Bravo

1st time I have ever made my own cranberry sauce and it was super easy. My only suggestion with this recipe is to make it the day before. The orange flavour was strong the first day but the second day - perfect.

I loved this recipe!  I threw in some blueberries, (sorry “some” is about as exact as I can be - my grandmother taught me to cook and I don’t think I ever saw her use a measuring spoon or cup), and it cut down on the tartness of the cranberries just enough to make this a family favorite.  This is the best cranberry sauce I’ve ever eaten.  Makes me wish fresh cranberries were available year round here in Japan!

Made the following changes based on other reviews:
Change 1 c white sugar to: 1/2 c white + 1/2 c brown sugar
Add 1 t orange zest
Add 1/2 t cinnamon

Cook for 20 minutes to make it thicker.  Mash with a potato masher a few times while boiling.

*Good on oatmeal for breakfast and as a turkey sandwich spread :)

A staple for holiday dinners in my house. My teen son now is in charge of making it and feels like a chef. Very easy to make. I’d add to cook it a little longer while it pops and give it a good rough mash (depending on how “saucy” you like it). I read another review where they half the sugar into white and brown. I’ll try that next time but it is very good the way it is!

I’ve been making this recipe for quite a few years and the only difference is that I add orange zest and cook it a bit longer than suggested. Everyone loves it and I’ve recently started making extra and putting it in jars for friends and family to take home.

I made this today for tomorrow's supper (as per a few people's suggestion to make ahead to give the OJ time to mellow). I taste tested it today however and I thought it was very tasty! Very tart, very sweet, but that's how I like my cranberry sauce. I do hope that it thickens up more by tomorrow. When I put it in the fridge it was a little runny. I followed recipe exactly, and had set a timer for 10 minutes once I added cranberries. Well I was busy making pecan pie and timer went off and either I didn't hear the popping and something but next I knew it was boiling over! Needless to say I took it off the heat at that point. So keep an eye on this so you don't have a sticky cranberry mess to clean up off your stove!

I was sceptical at first due to the orange juice and amount of sugar but went ahead with this recipe due to the number of positive reviews. It was a big hit! The tanginess of the cranberries counter the sugar. This will definitely be my go to in the future.

This recipe is delicious as written and will be enjoyed by anyone who likes cranberry sauce. When cooking for just my family I add a small amount of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. It's delicious on turkey sandwiches with mayo, salt and pepper!

This recipe turned out wonderfully. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used a splatter screen to reduce the mess the cranberries will make while popping.                  I used both brown and white sugar and zested a fresh orange into the sugars and mixed well. I also juiced the fresh orange and used less of the orange juice.

It didn't thicken enough.  Also I felt the orange flavor was a bit too strong and would have preferred a little more cranberry flavor.

Great stuff!  Added a half cup of bourbon and threw the whole thing covered into the over to cook until the berries burst - much quicker than on the stovetop.  Will make again next holiday!

This is so much better than canned cranberry sauce and so easy to make. It's delicious just like it is, or you can easily make changes and add ingredients to suit your taste.  I didn't have orange juice, so I added the juice and zest from an orange and enough water to make a cup. I also replaced half of the sugar with Splenda to cut down the calories.  I made it the day before Thanksgiving to let the flavors develop. It's really good but it's a little too sweet for me, so I chopped up a small tart apple and added that to the leftovers - fabulous!! Next time I make this, I'll use 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and maybe add some chopped pecans.

I made it with about 2/3 of the sugar which was enough.  Pretty basic. Pretty good. I would make it again.

Easy and delicious - I've always been a canned Jelled Cranberry  person, but never again.  This recipe was yummy.  I followed another's suggestion of 1/2 regular sugar 1/2 brown sugar - I used dark brown sugar since that was all i had  - very tasty!

Very delicious and super easy to make. I used fresh squeezed orange juice and added one chopped up pear to the bag of cranberries. The color was beautiful. I could use with slightly less sugar next time I make it. Still, yummy!!!

I loved this sauce. The only thing that it was a little too sweet for my taste so I added a little bit of water. I will definitely make it again next year, I'll just add less sugar. And I will be making it the day before because the day after thanksgiving, this sauce was amazing.

I’ve made this three years in a row now for Thanksgiving and it’s a huge success! However I’ve tweaked it. After the cranberries pop I mash them with a mashed potatoes masher. Then i add the following:  1 C. Dole Crushed Pineapple (in 100% juice) after all; 1/2 C. Sugar; and another 1/4 cup orange juice. To me it gives it just the right tart vs sweet balance. And the fam all seem to agree!

Very good, very simple.  Taste for sweetness since natural cranberries are never the same.  I cook down until about half the berries are reduced.  Let cool.

Amazing!

This was my first time hosting thanksgiving and my first time making cranberry sauce. This surpassed my expectations, I thought this recipe seemed to good to be true, but it is just that good! I did tweak it just a tad by using natural orange juice from oranges I squeezed myself and at the end I added just a small amount of cinnamon. It turned out prefect! My guests loved it and I will make it again for sure.

So good! The only holiday I've ever eaten cranberry sauce. Followed other suggestions, half white sugar, half brown sugar, cooked twice as long and added in 1/8 cup Grand Marinier at the end.

This recipe is great as is.  I left it on the stove on my lowest setting while I was making other things.  I took it off 15 min before dinner and it was perfect.  The cranberry taste is just right.

Unsweetened orange  juice is a great balance against the berry tartness. I substituted apple sauce in place of sugar to temper the glycemic impact and added a dash of cyanne pepper to waken the taste buds.

Easy and good.  The only thing notable was one of the family had an orange juice allergy I had not accounted for.  Fortunately she skipped the cranberry sauce and only let me know when I was sharing the recipe.

This was tasty but a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar since the orange also adds sweetness.

My whole family prefers canned cranberry jelly. The only reason I made this recipe was because my brother in law likes whole cranberry sauce. He enjoyed it so much everyone else tasted it and loved it so much the canned cranberry jelly didn't get touched. I suppose we will be having this instead of canned stuff next year.

Oh my! This sauce was wonderful.  I followed the lead of a few other reviewers and used 1/2 of white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also used only 3/4 cup of orange juice.  But I added 1/4 cup of peach schnapps and a cinnamon stick.  It came out fantastic!

We all loved these cranberries. Did as others suggested and used brown sugar and white sugar but 1/4 less overall than recipe stated.  I also added a cinnamon stick after mashing it and left the cinnamon stick in it.

Did all recipe said except I thought I had an orange but it was a small grapefruit. So I grated some of it and put about 4 TBS. into the cranberries and cooked with the sugar. Turned out wonderful.  I will never buy canned cranberries again.

I never made cranberry sauce before but this was a breeze. I altered it by using half the sugar and it still came out really sweet. It was a hit! I will definitely make this again.

No changes. Just the right amount of sweet and tart. I have also made in the past with coconut sugar and was just as good.

actually did it a little different. Used 12 oz of cranberries. 2 cups of apple juice and only half a cup of sugar. Cooked that for about 15 minutes and hit it with an immersion blender. did not strain it. It was great.

I never liked cranberry sauce when I was younger, but now that I am much much older and wiser, I decided to give it a chance.  I made this recipe last night and boy...did it blow my mind away!  Reading some of the reviews, I decided to cut back a little on the sugar.  I used a little over half a cup of white sugar and it came out just right.  Not too sweet and definitely a mild hint of tartness.  Just perfect.

I rated this a 4 star only because I changed some things. I used 3/4 cup oj and 1/4 cup water, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and I used orange zest from 1/2 of a naval orange. Cooked it over medium heat for 10 mins and then put in a bowl to cool then in fridge until turkey time! It has a wonderful taste and made my house smell sooo good!! Definitely a keeper!!

Happy Thanksgiving!  I just made this but used fresh orange juice instead of Tropicana so it turned out the perfect sweet/tart.  Will certainly make it again.

I went with the suggestions from folks to split the sugar between brown and white and the OJ with Grand Marnier (I had Gran Gala on hand instead). This cranberry sauce is really good. Enough sweet to cut the tart, but still leave you puckering a little. The Grand Marnier adds a little something extra, but I'm willing to bet the recipe would have been only an eight of a star less grand without these changes if any less at all. Keeping this one on my favorites list!

So good and so easy to make!  You'll never want to eat canned cranberry sauce again.   This recipe on it's own is 5 stars, and very versatile.  I like to make the following additions: zest and juice 1 orange,  then add water to equal 1 cup liquid, use 1/2 brown & half granulated sugar, and add a dash of cinnamon.  I also decrease the sugar to about 3/4 c. total., and find that I need to cook the sauce for a good 20 minutes to get my desired consistency.

This is amazingly delicious and super quick and easy! I followed someone else's suggestions and made these minor adjustments: 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar, added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and simmered for 20 min rather than 10. The only reason I'm not giving if 5 stars is because I didn't make the recipe exactly as is but it is definit  I was concerned about it being too sweet as some mentioned but I think it is perfect!!

I changed mine too. I used the 2 packages fresh cranberries, 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugars, juice from one navel orange, 1/4 cup Grand Marinier, 1 peeled and diced green apple, 8oz can crushed pineapple with juice, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. I cooked on low 20 minutes and added zest from navel at the end.

This is my second year making this, but I changed one thing; apple cider instead of orange juice. Of you use OJ, it tastes like OJ. It's a bonus if you can find cranberry apple cider.

Made it last year the first time and loved it! I liked the canned stuff before but this is so much better! It seemed to get better the longer it sat. So this year I am making it ahead. You can use it for all kinds of meals, make it wit a pot roast, mashed potatoes etc. it is the best!! I love cranberries now too

My first attempt at home made cranberry sauce. Followed other reviewers advice, ½ c white and ½ c brown sugars, added ¼ t cinnamon and stirred in ? c Grand Marnier as it cooled. Wonderfully easy and so very good!

I substituted splenda for the sugar to make it a bit more diabetic friendly and it still tastes good. I might try tweaking it a little more for next year but in the meantime, yummy!

Cranberry Sauce was always a Thanksgiving afterthought in our family, but this recipe has become a holiday staple for the past several years. Simple, tasty, make it the night before. This recipe is very flexible. Sometimes we cut the sugar in half - it can be a little sweet. We have also substituted half the OJ for Grand Marnier or Cointreau. It is a huge hit.

Love this and so does everybody that has tried it! Even people who don't like cranberries!  I also do the 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar and use a little less so it's not quite a full cup.

I make this every year. I usually start with 3/4 cup of sugar and taste to decide whether it needs the last 1/4 cup. Use quality, not-from-concentrate OJ, or juice your own.

I don't remember where the idea came from but instead of 2 cups of orange juice I used 1 1/2 cups of orange juice and 1/2 a cup of Grand Marnier liqueur. This recipe is requested for every turkey dinner I make or get invited to.

Simple and oh so delicious cranberry sauce recipe.  Until I came across this recipe, I avoided cranberry sauce at the holidays because I was used to seeing the canned gel variety.  I didn't like it at all.  However, this recipe completely changed my idea about cranberry sauce.  I love to serve this over turkey for Thanksgiving and it also goes very well with my sweet cornbread stuffing.

Just what I was looking for. Sweet, tart and thickens beautifully. I served it as a traditional side with Turkey and used the leftovers as kolacky filling instead of cherry. Turned out great.

This has been my go-to cranberry sauce recipe for 3 Thanksgivings now. I don't like mine so sweet, so I only use 1/2C of sugar. I also use only 1/2C oj and 1/2C water. It comes out with just the right amount of tart-to-sweet my husband and I like. I've put in 1/2tsp (give or take) of cinnamon during the cooking too and people really seem to like that. If you don't want whole-berry sauce, use a strainer with small holes, put a large bowl under it, and mash the berries with the back of a large spoon, leaving just the liquid and pulp in the bowl. We put some of the remaining skins back in for a little texture.

It got better as time went on! I made this for the first time for my husband and daughter as a special treat.  They usually eat the canned cranberry sauce.  I actually ended up eating the leftovers almost a week later!!   Next time I'll make it a few days early.  Really easy!!

Very good as it is.   The proportions are right.  If you cook the sauce for 10 minutes from time of boil, it will thicken nicely.   To take this to 5 stars:  with about two minutes of cooking time left, add 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon and 2-3 Tbsp. Grand Marnier Orange Liqueur, OUTSTANDING!

I have never ever made this or had this as part of a meal but I recently discovered I actually liked the taste and the way it just goes with the turkey. I decided to follow this recepie and and it turned out amazing!!! I added just a little bit more sugar  and it was perfect. Everyone loved it including my best friend who absolutely hates cranberry sauce...

Love this cranberry sauce, I've made it at least 5 times already this year. I follow the recipe exactly except I add 1/4 tsp cinnamon as another reviewer suggested. This is the perfect holiday side dish, the added cinnamon is subtle in its own flavor but brings out a delicious complexity.

I followed the recipe exactly and loooved it!  My first attempt at a cranberry sauce, and it was delicious.  Just the right amount of sweet and tangy, and you can definitely taste the orange.  Delicious.  Only change I made was that my berries didn't pop much, so I mashed them slightly.  This is definitely a new staple recipe.

it was THE BEST ever!!! I only knew the store bought stuff out the can.. yuck!! THIS IS   T H E   B E S T  EVER!!!  it was a tad too sweet, but nothing that can be changed next time and it was also quick, do it the day before you need it and it can gel nicely over night  :D  
I wil never get the can stuff ! (leftovers where eaten with my salad -with candied walnuts and apple pieces cooked in the same pan as the walnuts..gives it a nice taste)

Way too sweet. Next time I would either  use the orange juice but skip the sugar altogether or cook it in water instead of OJ, use  half the sugar and add orange zest. 

It's quite runny so I poured out 1/4 of the liquid after the cranberries popped, cooked it for longer and whisked everything together for something closer to a jam consistency.

This was my second time ever making homemade cranberry sauce. I added a dash of cinnamon, cut the sugar in half and added an ounce or 2 of Jack Daniel's Tennessee fire and orange zest. So good. I cooked it a little longer to thicken it up. I want to put it in a glass and pour champagne over it!

So good and easy.  I will NEVER go back to canned. I read the other reviews and decided to go with half white and half brown sugar. I also did 3/4 cups instead of a whole cup of sugar. And I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I make extra and fill some small canning jars for guests that want to take some home, then I freeze what's left.

Super easy recipe and tasted much better than the canned sauce! I reduced the sugar to about 2/3 cup and used my juicer to make the fresh OJ. I also used some of the "zest" from the juicer basket in the sauce. I put this in pint jars and decorated them with some ribbon to give out with my Cranberry Lime infused Vodka for friends.  I'll never buy canned cranberry sauce again!

I love cranberry sauce and I love this recipe!  It's easy and fun to make. I make it exactly as is and it turns out great. If you're worried about it being too thin just let it set for a while. I did add two drops of Young Living Cinnamon Bark essential oil this last time and that put it over the top.

I used this recipe to make my own cranberry sauce for the very first time.  When it was almost done I tasted and knew it was not a holiday cranberry sauce and immediately added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and that did the trick.  Thanksgiving 2016 was the year people who liked cranberry sauce okay loved this sauce and others who did much liked it ate this recipe.  Making it for Christmas now.

This is the exact same recipe that I have been using for several years.  The only thing I do different is I throw in a cinnamon stick while it's cooking. Of course in my opinion cinnamon makes anything better!!! Oh and I use my potato masher to smash up the cranberries a little bit.  Wonderful recipe!!!

Made the recipe just as stated, and it thickened up perfectly. I now wish I had let it alone! But went ahead and added 1/4 cup of expensive Grand Marnier, and WOW, that was way too much! Would have been even yummier with just 1-2 TBL. My guests thought I was trying to get them drunk! Will make it again though, it was delicious as written.

Just added 1/4 tsp cinnamon while cooking. Adds nice autumn flavor. Tip: also use lid on sauce pan to save on cleanup!

I love, love, love this recipe.  I always like cranberry sauce but never truly cared for the canned stuff. This stuff definitely takes the cake and completely replaces the canned . I tried to make a double batch the other day and noticed that might need just a tad more sugar if you're going to double it. The flavor was just A little more tart than normal so I think I'll try adding 1/4 cups extra sugar next time.

This recipe is amazing.  I have never made cranberry sauce and this was simple and yummy.  I like mine a little thicker so I used a potato smasher to crush the cranberries and make it thicker without large bits of fruit.  I made it 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated it, and it was so good.
** Note**
I agree with those before me that stated that this recipe does need a pinch of cinnamon.  I tried the sauce before I added the cinnamon, and the cranberry and orange really competed with one another.  The cinnamon takes the edge off of both.

There are only a few family members that look for the cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving dinner. I decided to make fresh sauce vs. our usual canned version. What a difference the fresh taste makes. It was a delicious accompaniment to the turkey. I found this cranberry sauce to have the perfect level of sweetness. The only addition I made was to add the zest and fruit "meat" (without the pith) of one orange.  It was very easy to make and I will make this again.

I love true cranberry sauce! It's really hard to find a recipe that actually passes all the tests. I loved this one! Of course, like anyone, I can't leave well enough alone, so I altered it a wee bit. Instead of all OJ, I halved it with Cranberry pomegranate juice. Perfect tartness without being overly orangy. LOVE this!!

Hubby gave a 4 & I would've a 3. Did need to cook longer than directions, since it didn't want to thicken when cooling. To me it seemed both sweet in some bites & sour in others.  For ease this is great & may only make if running out of time for dinner.

At first I was intimidated because an in-law of mine usually makes a fabulous cranberry sauce with apricots and pineapple for Thanksgiving but after seeing all the positive reviews, had to try it myself.  Very good and very easy.  I doubled the recipe, added some cinnamon and orange zest like other reviewers suggested and at first I thought it was too sweet but next day it was just fine and everyone liked it.  Will make again and I think I will add crushed pineapples next time and leave out the orange zest.

It was so easy, so tasty. I added a bit of cinnamon as suggested by the reviews. Definitely more than 1/4 teaspoons because I accidentally put too much in, but it still turned out yummy and my family LOVED it.

My first time making cranberry sauce and it was a big hit at our Thanksgiving table. As suggested by others I used 1/2 of the amount of orange juice to keep sauce from being too thin, but then added about 1/8 cup brandy at the end after cooking for about 15 minutes. I also used half white, half brown sugar and mashed with a potato masher a few times. Perfect consistency and wonderful taste!

Made this for Thanksgiving as I had a few guests that like cranberry sauce.  What a surprise!  So easy and so good.  Even the guests that don't like cranberries thought it was wonderful.

Loved it! Added slightly less sugar which probably really didn't make a difference. It was the best I've ever made!

This is great (4.5 stars) as-is, but some of my family thought the orange flavor was a little strong the first time I made it.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut the orange juice in half and used half water. I also substituted brown sugar for half of the white sugar. Those changes mellowed and balanced the flavor, and in my opinion it's a 5-star recipe with those two changes.

The last time I made it, I added 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, which gave it just a bit more holiday joy. I get lots of compliments (and I have to double the recipe!) when I bring this to family gatherings.

Very good! I did let it cook longer to get it to thicken more and I used freshly squeezed orange juice.

Cranberry sauce is one of the easiest Thanksgiving sides to make!  I altered this to 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup orange juice, 1 cup white sugar and grated a little  orange peel into it.  So good!

I made this recipe and followed it to the letter. The sauce did not thicken. Also I think the recipe called for too much sugar. Don't know why it didn't thicken. Maybe didn't cook raspberries long enough or maybe should've thawed raspberries first.  It tasted good but it was a little on the sweet side for me so I think I will cut back on sugar next time I make it.

This is absolutely the best cranberry sauce recipe ever!  I took the advise of the previous reviewer and split the sugar 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar. Then added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. It was a WOW and my family raved about it.

I thought this was incredibly good just the way the recipe is written.  I cannot believe how easy it is to make your own cranberry sauce! All our  guests raved about it. I like the suggestions some cooks have about adding orange zest and Grand Marnier. I think I will do that next time, but I will reduce the OJ by the amount of Grand Marnier I add. By the way, this makes quite a bit of sauce, so we served it on crepes for breakfast the next day. FANTASTIC!

This is far too sweet.  Oddly enough, though, once it cooled ( I let it sit in the fridge overnight) it wasn't as sweet as when I had my husband try it (day of). He has a huge sweet tooth, so I thought he wouldn't mind,  but  even he said it was " like sugar punching you in the face". I tried adding water, about a cup and a half and reheating it. I don't know if the heat just broke down the sugar even more, but it didn't really help. I think this might make a great jam on toast, but not as an accompaniment to a meat dish. 

If I were to do this again, I would just add a 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1/3 of orange juice, and about a cup of water.

I wanted to try something new this year as cranberries (canned) are Thanksgiving traditions, that no one in my family eats. 
 I made this recipe using the suggestion of 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar but followed the original recipe exactly other than that.  
It was too thick after it cooled but I added some orange juice and it was fine.  4 people out of 7 tried it and LOVED it!  
This was so easy and this will be my go to from now on.

Great Recipe! I followed some other suggestions to alter it.  I used 1/2 c. sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar. Also simmered for 20 minutes and added 2 shakes of cinnamon.  After chilling, it had a nicely gelled but not firm consistency. The family said it is now a holiday staple! :)

Super simple and tastes great!  I've been making this for the past several years now, no more canned sauce for us.  I may try adding some additional spices at some point, but I really like the pure tart taste as is.  I do mash the cranberries with the back of a wooden spoon after they pop and soften and then cook long enough for the sauce to thicken.  I usually make this 1-2 days prior to our Thanksgiving meal.  Love it!

5 stars for ease with this one, but I did make some adjustments to suit my taste. I used all the orange juice called for, but reduced the amount of sugar by about a third. The entire amount of sugar, paired with the OJ makes it way too sweet. All also added a heavy dash of cinnamon  and ground nutmeg. So delish!

Easy and delicious !
I reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup. I mash some of the berries with the back of the wooden spoon and  keep the pan on stove, while stirring until there is no more foam on the surface and the sauce is glossy and somewhat thick. I always make the day before Thanksgiving and store covered in the fridge.

If you reduce the mixture until just before jammy, then it's a good cranberry sauce.  I didn't use the full amount of sugar in the recipe, only 3/4 cup, but it turned out just fine.  I prefer a different recipe, but this one was easy to make.

After reading most of the reviews....I decided to put on my body armor in order to take on this task.  I followed the recipe, but adjusted the sugar amount due to dietary needs only.  After cranberries were in there for about 10 minutes, I put my helmet on, and started to smash the berries. Yes they will explode somewhat, but if you find they are tender....just go in and smash them.  All kidding aside, this recipe was great.  I will never buy canned cranberry sauce again.

Make this for Thanksgiving! It is wonderful! I also split the sugars, half white, half brown and added cinnamon. I cooked for about 20 minutes. Then added pecans. Husband loved it! Everyone loved it.

This is the first year I decided to make cranberry sauce. I've had fresh cranberry sauce before and I love it! This recipe was very good and easy to follow. I cooked it a little longer just to make sure that most of the cranberries had popped. The consistency was perfect and it tasted very good! My only complaint is I like the tart taste of the cranberry and it was so sweet it didn't really have that same tartness to it. If you're not usually a cranberry fan, this is probably the recipe for you! I will probably make this again using very little sugar, but keeping the orange juice since I like the flavor it gives! Thank you for sharing!

I used a fourth cup less OJ than it called for and a small handful more cranberries. I also boiled it longer until it gelled before I took it off the heat. In the end, I got great feedback, and it was good sauce, but I could definitely taste the OJ more than I wanted to.

I cut the sugar to a quarter of a cup, so it wouldn't taste like candy. Also added a shot of cointreau. Something was missing though, and it took me a while to realize it was orange zest; It really puts it over the top. Next year, I will remember to zest some orange peel into it.

I make this every year but I use Splenda instead of the sugar.  It is WONDERFUL. Even great on oatmeal the next day or spread on toast.

Great recipe! Made it multiple times and everyone loves it.  I double the recipe and use fresh orange juice (sold in grocery produce dept).  Also add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and cook for 20 min (thicker than cooking for only 10 min).  Mash a couple times with potato masher.  Comes out perfect!!

We've made this several times and it's always great. This past time we tweaked it some and used 1/2 Cup OJ, 1 cup honey and tossed in some lime zest at the end. Added a nice twist to the recipe. Try it as is first and then have fun and make the recipe your own and get creative with the sauce for the holiday table!

The sauce was tart just as I like it.  I used about half granulated sugar and half Stevia.  While still hot, I used hand mixer  to make  the cranberry  mixture saucier.  I am pleased with the results-Very easy to make recipe. I was prompted to  make homemade cranberry sauce because my husband avoids high fructose corn syrup. It's hard to find cranberry sauce that doesn't have it.  I'm glad I tried this recipe.  I will definitely make it again!

I took the advice of the other reviews and did 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar and let it simmer an extra ten minutes for a total of twenty. Very easy and good.

Excellent!  Used the juice of 2 fresh squeezed oranges (1C).  I also cut the sugar entirely in half (using 1/4C brown sugar and 1/4Cwhite).  Added pumpkin pie seasoning bc I didn't have nutmeg & about a teaspoon fresh orange peel.

Best cranberry sauce that I've had in 54 years! Well, I was 53 last year when I first made it, but I'm making it again this year. I didn't change a thing. It was a huge hit with the family. Thank you for sharing this recipe! 

If only we could buy fresh cranberries all year. After Thanksgiving, I will still be making this for myself, and I will probably experiment with using honey rather than sugar, and perhaps some whole orange pieces instead of juice.

Several raters said that there was too much sugar in this recipe, so I tried to cut down on it. I found it to be much too tart without and ended up adding it right back. Great recipe!! Definitely making this again.

For those who like things a little more tart, 3/4 cup sugar instead of a whole cup. Add some cinnamon (ground or cinnamon sugar) and it gives it a unique twist.

Made this for the first time on Thanksgiving and followed it almost to the t. I cut back the sugar by 1/2cup and the sauce was a little tart. Cooked it for fifteen mins to thicken it slightly and added a cinnamon stick to the cooking process then discarded stick after removing from the heat. Aromatic and simple and delicious. Will make again.

This is absolutely delicious!! I added a small amount of cinnamon, 3/4 cup white sugar instead of 1cup, 1/4 cup brown sugar and threw in a couple handfuls of blueberries. I cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for, which gave the cranberries more time to cook down and the sauce to thicken. I make this a couple of days in advance so the flavors mix well together. Yum!!  It's a keeper for sure!!

Love this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to slow simmer for over an hour this way the sauce thickened and the texture is awesome.

I was nervous when my brother requested fresh cranberry sauce however this is the first thanksgiving without my mother and I wanted to make sure it was great so I decided to try. This recipe was so quick and easy. When it was done I tested some and ended up licking the spoon clean - so delicious! Definitely something I will make again

My first attempt at cranberry sauce.  I always used the canned stuff because I didn't eat it. I actually tasted this...and will be serving it on Thanksgiving.  
I did blend it a bit after it cooked. Not so chunky. 
It changed my mind about C sauce.

I grew up with the canned version of cranberry sauce and never liked it.  However, my family enjoyed it, so I continued to serve it at Thanksgiving dinner.  I first made this recipe - as written - three years ago.  I love it! My family's response determined that I will NEVER return to cranberry sauce from a can.

I've made this recipe for years.  I use less sugar and put a splash of fresh squeezed lemon or  lime juice in the pot.  Extra citrus is always a plus.  Make plenty for the holidays.  We use it all year long with pork and chicken too.

Fine, basic cranberry sauce recipe.  Made this yesterday, allowing to cook down to a thickened state, for use as the filling in the Cranberry Bar recipe.  Was fine!  While it can be further enhanced quite a bit, this is a go-to basic way to make it.

I've made this recipe now for the third year running ; and its a winner every time. No changes necessary ! I normally double or tipple this recipe as my kids love the leftover sauce. They eat it as jam on bread, and I use it as a filling for cranberry crumble or bars. Excellent Recipe !!!

My large, extended family loves cranberries during the holidays and this is how they are done...except I cook them for far longer than 10 minutes. We like ours fresh, but still more of a smooth consistency, with some whole berries. Holiday dinners, turkey in particular, are not the same without this easy, incredibly tasty recipe.

I love this recipe and after doing it a few times now, I have found that what works best for me is to add a bit more cranberries than advised (I usually do about 15 ounces), use the cup of orange juice, but only a half of cup of sugar. I'm going to try substituting the sugar for molasses the next time I make it as I am trying to cut back on my sugar intake.

This really is the BEST homemade cranberry sauce for several reasons. 1) It tastes simply wonderful, and 2) it's super easy to make with only three ingredients.  Those two things make it a top-notch recipe in my book!

My family loved it. You can also make it with just water instead of orange juice, and it still tastes fine. A little too sweet, but I did not cut the sugar too much unless you want very tart sauce. I will make this again. :)

I loved this recipe! No need to add anything else to it. I admit I used frozen cranberries (you try finding them fresh in July) and I did not have time to thaw them beyond the car ride home. If you do the same, the cranberries will need to cook for 25 minutes and they won't pop. They were probably done at 20 minutes but I was hopeful they would pop. I used a potato masher to smush them twice after I removed from the heat. Jelled up beautifully as it cooled and was very fragrant.

Very simple to make, full of flavor, doesn't leave you slaving over the stove. Can be too sweet, so you may want to cut down the amount of sugar if you don't like it too sweet, but this is really per preference, and a simple taste test will easily tell you what you need. I found it to be absolutely amazing, my husband thought it was too sweet. Next time I will try 3/4 C of sugar to see if I can meet my husband halfway.

I've made this recipe three different times.  My husband loves it and I've used it on turkey, oatmeal, pork, chicken, etc.

Well, I used this recipe as a guide and sort of did my own thing...as I have a tendency to do!  Anyway I also added raspberries, divided the sugar into 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, threw in a couple cinnamon sticks and a splash of vanilla (for good measure!)  Surprisingly, this turned out really good.  Thanks, Toni, for the inspiration to make my own cranberry sauce for the first time ever.  Now there's no going back to that store bought kind.  It was not only delicious, but easy!  My kind of recipe!!!!!

I have made this 3 times.  1.  followed the recipe exactly, except I substitute 3/4 cup of Agave  (I like Amber) since we use very little white sugar (3/4 C Agave=1 C White sugar).  2.  I added chopped apple (great) and 3.  I added chopped apple and chopped walnuts.  Depends on what you like . I cool a little and then put in the refrigerator , lightly  covered , until I use it.  Terrific recipe.  Gail

This recipe was incredibly easy to make. I had never tried to make cranberry sauce before.  This was so good. Wonderful tartness, and sweet sauce.  My kids were reluctant to try it, but when they did, they liked it.  I used the recipe as is with one exception. I added 2 orange peel strips as it was boiling.  I also cooked it the additional few minutes to ensure its thickness.   One thing should be noted though.  This is a make ahead dish.  I didn't  and the sauce was runny, till it cooled.

Quick and delicious! I think next time I will use less OJ to make it less runny. The color is beautiful and looks absolutely stunning on the table in a white or glass serving bowl.

Really great recipe! I added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon to mine. Once the berries started to pop, I left it on low heat while stirring occasionally for about 30 mins. I'll never go canned again!

Just made this for Christmas dinner... I was out of orange juice so I squeezed 2 oranges then added cranberry/raspberry juice.  Tastes delicious and I'm sure everyone will agree.  So simple to make, thanks for sharing.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon & 1/4 teaspoon of powder clove. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of refined white sugar.
Since a had a few nearly spoiled raspberries, I dumped those in there as well (about 10). Turned out soooo good but a little bitter...which is what I like.

Definitely a great baseline cranberry sauce but still found it to be a bit tart. I added about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and added about 2 tablespoons sugar and it was fantastic!

I'm really bummed I didn't read through reviews previously. I found it to be *way* too sweet, and the combination of sugar and orange juice muted the natural cranberry flavor too much.

The best! I used half white/half brown sugar and a half teaspoon of orange zest, in addition to the juice.  Canned sauces are a thing of the past for this family.  Easy and so good! Thanks Toni!

Great base recipe to work from! I added a stick of cinnamon, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and mandarin orange zest. I would also recommend cutting down on the orange juice if you are looking for a thicker cranberry sauce.

I read the reviews and took Liza's advice.  I used 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup pineapple juice and 1 cup sugar.  Dissolved.  Then added 1 6-oz. container of raspberries - cooked until I could mush with a fork.  Then added 1/4 cup grand marinier and I also added a few dashed of cinnamon.  I also roasted chopped pecans with butter in a skillet instead of raw pecans.  Taste wonderful after a few days in fridge.  Very good - will make again.

I enjoy making this cranberry sauce so much! Adding orange juice instead of water really gives it great flavor, and the brightness of color once it's cooled is beautiful. This recipe is wonderful, and I'll never buy canned cranberry sauce again!

This was a big hit at our family Thanksgiving dinner!  I added a cinnamon stick and some orange zest.  Also, I hit it with a stick blender for a few seconds to smooth it out a bit.

Absolutely delicious and so easy! I boiled the cranberries in orange juice instead of water to give it the extra citrus taste and it was incredibly sweet and so good. Loved it

This was a wonderful recipe!! Normally we do cranberry jelly by oceanspray, yes the canned kind. This year I was hosting twelve people and wanted something fresh. It was a delicious sweet and tangy hit!  I doubled the recipe but made some slight changes. I used 1/2 water and 1/2 orange juice  (naked orange juice) instead of only orange juice. I also added a 1/4 extra sugar. I added these things to get a good balance of sweet and tangy. I also put everything in the pot at once, brought it to a boil for about 3 minutes and then let it simmer for close to twenty minutes, until all the berries have popped, stirring during the entire process. My goal was a thicker sauce, and it does thicken as it cools. My advice is to make this the night before you need it and it seems to thicken overnight as well in yhe refrigerator.

I followed Liza's lead adding Grand Marnier, raspberries, pineapple and pecans.  Used half orange juice and half pineapple.  I like the tartness of cranberries,so used less sugar and substituted brown sugar for half of it.  Soooooo good!  I'll never eat canned cranberries again!

Great basic recipe. I substituted apple cider for OJ, due to food allergy and added about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Decreased sugar to 2/3 cup due to the extra sweetness added from the cider. Added a little cinnamon and cloves. Cooked it about 20-25 min and let set over night in the refrigerator. Everyone loved it!

My family loves this one, even my husband who is skeptical about anything cranberry.  This year I changed it a little.  I added raisins and used pomegranate juice in addition to the orange juice.  It was awesome!  Thanks for sharing your great recipe.  No more cranberries in a can for me.

Great basic recipe. Changed it up a bit: quarter cup granulated sugar, quarter cup brown sugar (instead of just one cup gran). Doubled the cooking time and added nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.

So easy to make.  I started making my own vs. canned cranberry sauce two years ago using this same recipe.  It is the simplest most elegant part of the whole meal. I will never buy another can of sauce again!  I did leave out the orange and just used water.  I love making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas Dinners.

This was a good recipe.  I did use red orange juice.  Very tasty and I still tasted the tartness of the cranberries.  Next time, I will use 1/4 less juice because I like my sauce thicker.  It was just  a tad bit too loose for me.  I will also try some of the other suggestions from other reviews.  This is a keeper.

This is a great sauce. We use a little less sugar and add 1/4 tsp cinnamon for some spice. Cooking it longer does help thicken, if it comes out too runny.

I used 3/4 c orange juice, 3/4 c white sugar, 1/4 c brown sugar and added 1/4 c Grand Mariner at the end.  The BEST cranberry sauce I've ever had.

Very easy recipe and quick. But I found that it was just a tad too tart for my taste and was reluctant to add more sugar. Instead I cut the sugar to 3/4 cups and added about 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries, mashed everything a little and cooked for two minutes more to thicken just a little bit more.  Everyone loved it.  This is the only way I will ever make cranberry sauce again.

So, so good! I made it for my Dad who always eats the canned version, I assume he will like this much better! I never liked cranberry sauce but I had to taste because it smelled amazing. I loved it! The only thing I changed was suggested by previous reviewers; half white sugar, half brown sugar and add 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Perfect!

I've been making this recipe for a couple years. My hard to impress 94 year old great grandmother has requested I make it this year and include some leftover for her, I of course feel honored. I usually add about a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to it when I make it and cook it a few minutes longer. This is my go to recipe! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

I have never been a fan of cranberry sauce but this was really good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added half brown sugar, half white, plus a 1/2 t of cinnamon.  The flavor perfectly complements the holiday.

This is so unbelievably easy and so good!!! I didn't start making my own Thansgiving dinner until a few years ago. I love making everything from scratch and my first year made almost a dozen different recipes. This was by far the easiest and best of the day. Just watch how much liquid you but in and make sure you give it time to get cold or it will be runny.

I've been making my own for years, and this is pretty-much the way I do it!

One cup of each ingredient per bag makes it easy to scale up. I filled mason jars with it one year and gave them out as gifts one year. 

I mash the cranberries with a fork or spoon while they're cooking and the texture is great. As far as the thickness I like mine cold so I refrigerate it for a few hours or overnight if I cook it the day before. Thickens up just just fine.

Just finished making this recipe and loved the simplicity and ease! I used a few recommendations to make my recipe.  It turned out absolutely delicious!
3/4 c  orange juice
1/4 c water
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 c white sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon
and my own addition of 1/8 tsp of ground ginger
This recipe has so many possibilities! I can't wait to share this dish on Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe and it tastes like oranges. NOT cranberries. I even reduced the sugar by half to try to cut out some of the sweetness I knew would be there from the orange juice. When I realized it was total loss I added some orange zest (why not at this point), a shot of brandy and a half teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. I let it cool. Made some sweet dough for my coffee cake recipe and layered the dough, the sauce and then another layer of dough and then a crumble topping. Bisquick makes a good coffee cake dough if your in a pinch, just add some sugar, an egg and milk until you get a thick but sticky dough. Spray or grease your pan and viola! Coffee cake. I'll follow the age old recipe from Ocean Spray for my sauce this year. It is always reliable and a dash of orange zest won't ruin it like the juice in this recipe did. Had I not been able to rescue this cranberry sauce by using it to fill a coffee cake I would have given it a 1 star rating. I hope this helps.

I've made this SEVERAL times and I will NEVER buy cranberry sauce again!  My only recommendation...ADD CINNAMON (ground or stick, doesn't matter).  The cinnamon really knocks it out of the park and the smell is incredible! I cooked mine much longer than the 10 minutes.

Very easy to make!  I will definatly use this on Thanksgiving as my cranberry sauce.  It was the right consistancy- I did not crush the berries.  As the sauce cooked the berries broke apart and left some as sauce and some as broken pieces.  Good flavor with the orange juice and cranberries.

As others recommended, used half brown sugar and half white.  Also used fresh squeezed OJ, as that's all I had and added grated orange peel.  Turned out FABULOUS!  My first time making cranberry sauce and I won't be buying the canned again.  Highly recommend this super easy recipe.

This is a great recipe, just with some tweaks. Instead of using orange juice, I used half apple cider and half water, so it wouldn't be so sweet. Because my family doesn't like any chunks, I took an immersion blender to it when the cranberries had popped. It is very smooth and jelly like now. I will definitely make it for Thanksgiving!

I have been making this recipe for a few years.  It's very easy to adapt.  I've made it "as is" several times but lately I've cut down on the sugar by using 1/2 cup sugar along with a couple of tbsp. of brown sugar with a dash of cinnamon.  Sometimes I add orange zest as well.   Great recipe I don't think you can really go wrong with.

I have made this as is and it is wonderful.  But I was feeling adventurous one day and I added the flesh of 1/2 orange and the rind of one orange for an extra orange kick.  I think I also slightly reduced the sugar in this one.  If you find you have it too sweet, you can always add a little lemon to try to balance it out, or cook a small amount of cranberries with just water and mix the together with your sweetened ones.

I love simple & tasty recipes. This checked both those boxes! Tip: keep stirring on medium heat until the proper consistency is achieved. I added a spoon or three of pineapple bits while it was cooling in a bowl. Yummy; for year-round we put it in our oatmeal in the morning. Not just for Thanksgiving :-)

This cranberry sauce is so good you can eat it as a dessert! I've been making it for thanksgiving for the last 5 years. Changes I've made over the years: add a little more sugar (about 2 extra TBLSPN), cook with 2 cinnamon sticks (remove after cooking) and I simmer the cranberries for about 30 min. I pop the unpopped berries and chill overnight prior to thanksgiving dinner.

A very nice, basic recipe. I skimmed off the foam during the cooking process and added a tiny bit of baking soda to counter the bitter aftertaste. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla at the very end before using a potato masher, LOL, for extra smoothness. Everyone loves it.

Love this recipe!  I've made cranberry sauce in the past and went back to canned because the results were not worth the trouble.  Not the case with this recipe. Not only was it easy to make, it was very tasty.  It was definitely a hit at Christmas Eve dinner.

I have used this as a base for years and absolutely love it's simplicity and flavor.  I do as many others have suggested and add a bit of Grande Marinier along with some autumn spices.  I like that I know exactly what's in this and that it can be made ahead of time.  Thank you :)

Excellent Thanksgiving essential. We usually use canned cranberry sauce, but not anymore. So easy, and so delicious. But keep a close eye on it. Mine boiled over so easily, even on lower heat.

Yum.  used two bags of berries.  Took everyone's suggestion and split the sugars  1/2 white and 1/2 Brown.  Added some grand mariner too.  I like my sauce a little tart and it was perfect. Made sure to boil it until all berries popped and I mashed them by hand.  Sat is fridge overnight and it was a hit.  In fact, I was asked for the recipe a few times.

I used a whole bag of cranberries to 1 cup orange juice, but slightly cut back the amount of sugar to about 3/4 cup or so, using half brown sugar and half white, due to other reviews mentioning that the orange juice would already have sugar. When I was done, I mashed it with a potato masher a bit. I loved it. Tangy and sweet. My 3-year old grandson was coaxed into tasting it on the tip of his tongue, and ended up dipping turkey and bread into it enthusiastically.

Thanks. Used about 1/2 cup of OJ (squeezed from orange), 1/4 cup of water and 3/4 cup sugar plus orange zest. Very good and nice and thick. Decided to add 1 tsp of triple sec after it cooled completely and liked it so much that I added 2 more teaspoonsful.

I followed the recipe and this never set up for me.  Maybe I should have cooked longer -- recipe directs to remove from heat when cranberries start to pop.  I left it cooking for awhile - definitely longer than 10 mins after they started to pop - but it was still pretty runny and had not started to congeal.  I was hoping the cooling process would help it congeal.  I even cooked the day ahead and it chilled overnight -- but still just runny.

I made this low carb using Splenda and orange zest and a crisp white wine (instead of orange juice) and it turned out great. Seriously why wouldn't you make this for your family, so simple to make and a ton more flavor than anything store bought!

It hasn't cooled all the way down yet, but just from tasting the hot sauce off the stove, I can tell it will be delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white, along with 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  This is my first time making cranberry sauce.

I will never buy cranberry sauce again! I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup pure cane, 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup unsweetened pineapple juice and 1/4 water.PERFECT!

Thanks for a wonderful cranberry recipe.  This cooked up really nice.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  So much better than the canned stuff.  Doesn't get any better than this.

This is my third year making this.  It's fast, it's simple and my 11 year old daughter has made it her tradition.  

This year, I reduced the OJ by a smidge because it's a little watery.  I thought about adding spices or trying another recipe but it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without this one!

I hate cranberry anything--especially canned cranberry sauce. Yuck! But this is the second year that I have made this recipe and it is so yummy. I used a 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added a splash of water to the orange juice. I cooked it for about 15 minutes and it thickened up perfectly. For a person who has never liked cranberry sauce--I love this. Excellent!

I have the recipe with a slight change.  Instead of orange juice I use a whole tangerine cut in half and then halved again into quarters.  I take out all seeds and put this with the cranberries in a pan and add a little water and 3/4 cup sugar.  Mix well.  Cook on med./low until the cranberries are very soft and popping.  I then remove the tangerine quarters and squeeze the remain juice into the sauce.  Works every time.  Quick and flavorful.  No more canned for me.

I added one thing - a pealed diced apple. I cut back on white sugar and used some brown sugar. I add slowly as the cooking progresses -  to taste. My 80 year old mother says she has never had better!

O.M.G. Fantabulous!!! I made this for my guests who like cranberry sauce with their turkey (thinking I wasn't going to touch it since I never like the canned cranberries)... Needles to say, I went for seconds and thirds... Wow... Party in my mouth. Do I have to wait till next November to make this?!

I made this last year and I will be making it again this year. It was marvelous. I made the following adjustments: I reduced the white sugar down to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also added in a bit of cinnamon at the very end.

This recipe is fantastic. I tried it for the first time today.  I used 1/2c white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. I fresh squeezed an orange which gave me 2/3 cup and I filled the rest of the cup with water, and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  First after a couple hours cold it didn't gel right so I put it back in the pot and added 2 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar and a couple slices of an apple. I also stirred in pecans. I cooked longer at a boil continuously stirring and it gelled up nicely. It's still chilling but it looks great. The extra pectin from the apple and thickening from the extra brown sugar helped. I will never buy canned again!

so, I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious! And so easy! I have no idea why I've never tried to make cranberry sauce before, but I am definitely going to be using this recipe every holiday from now on. I made it as-is, it was perfect.

This is a super easy to make and delicious! I added orange juice as mentioned but I reduced the amount of sugar to only a couple of teaspoons since orange juice has so much sugar in it. I also dropped some of the mixture in a blender when it cooled a little and made the texture a tad bit smoother. It came out great and everyone really loved it.

By far the best cranberry sauce I have ever had. I am not a fan of the canned sauce.  I brought this to a family Thanksgiving, and even those that prefer canned, enjoyed this sauce, as well.

I followed the recipe and I felt it was just a bit too sweet. It was still very delicious and better than canned so it was nice to make my own for the very first time. I will try it again but maybe less sugar. Thanks!

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I didn't have any oj on hand so I used water.  Way better than any store bought.  In 20 minutes you have fresh cranberry sauce.  Everyone loved it!

I make this all the time.  I will never buy the canned cranberry sauce again.  If there is any left over after the meal I make it for, I use it as a jelly.   It is quite tasty.

This is a great and easy cranberry sauce recipe. I really love the strong orange flavor that this one has but if you wanted less you could cut the orange juice with water. Tasty!

I used 1/2 c sugar instead and added 1-2 tsp lemon juice instead.  We also like it thicker, so we cut the juice to 1/2 too.  I didn't have orange, so I used pineapple juice instead.  It is tangy, but that is how my husband likes it.  thank you for a simple recipe!

I made this for the first time during Christmas and it was a big hit. I added a half cup of brown sugar to cut down on the bitterness.  As a caution, this will bubble up very rapidly so pay attention.

To get a perfect, not too sweet, not too tart sauce I used 1/2 C coconut sugar and a couple TBS of Truvia dissolved in 1/2 C orange juice and 1/2 C fresh pineapple juice with some of the pulp.  Topped the sauce with a walnut.  Pretty and delicious and couldn't be any easier!

So easy! So delicious! I made this exactly as directed for a family dinner. I got RAVE reviews from everyone, including my mother in law who had already opened up a can, determined that it would be better. She now asks me to make it every time the family gets together. Thanks so much for the perfect recipe!!!

MMMM! SO GOOD! To be honest, I probably did more than 12 oz of cranberries, and didn't really pay attention while everything heated up, so I never heard the cranberries pop. I just simmered it 10 or 15 min, then mashed it with a potato masher, and let it cool. Jelled perfectly, and has such a beautiful homemade taste!

AMAZING!  I have been using the same cranberry sauce recipe for over 32 years, but read this one and decided to give it a try. I used a mixture of brown and white sugars like so many others suggested. Along with just a pinch of cinnamon, I added my mulled apple cider sachet that had been simmering in the crock pot all day, to the first ten minutes of the cooking berries. Just added a real Christmassy touch and the house smelled wonderful too!

This is a good recipe!  Next time I will make a few changes.  We love cranberry sauce in our home.  Initially this recipe was not well received by the expert - my husband!  But as it sits for a day it gets better.  It has been voted THE BEST CRANBERRY SAUCE EVER by all Thanksgiving guests :)
The reason I want to make changes is that the orange juice makes the cranberry sauce very sweet - lots of sugar in the recipe.  I'm going to add 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup orange juice.

I followed the recipe exactly but I thought the oj was too overpowering. I added a little bit of allspice, clove and nutmeg and it was better. After the alteration, I would give 4 stars but before, high 2 or low 3.

Followed others advice to halve the OJ for a thicker sauce. Also added a splash of triple sec. I didn't want to take a chance on runny sauce. It was good, but ended up too firm. Next time, I'm following the original recipe!

I also split the sugar half white and half brown... all else the same, but I let it cook longer so it would be thicker and used an immersion blender on it as I like my foods more homogeneous.
Was Fabulous... and not too sweet for Anyone at our table... may use a tad more sugar next time.

I made two batches- one just as the recipe reads & the second using orange/pineapple juice and Splenda. 

Both batches turned out AMAZING, however I slightly prefer the Splenda batch (the cup of sugar feels like a lot to me personally, however it tasted fine). 

I highly recommend this recipe.

I found this recipe to be a little too tart. However, I used a low-sugar orange juice and I think it'd be much better with a regular or hand-squeezed orange juice.

My husband was skeptical when I told him I was going to make cranberry sauce from scratch for thanksgiving this year, he loves the canned jelly stuff.  He was pleasantly surprised when I let him sample the finished product.  We will make this every holiday in our home.

This recipe was out of this world.  Super simple and far better than all the more complicated recipes for cranberry sauce I've tried.  I used orange juice, cranberries, half brown, half white sugar, and a dash of cinnamon.  Thanks for the treat!

Turned out pretty good but was a little too sweet for my taste.  I made it exactly as written.  The "orangeyness" was perfect for me and the texture was great, really gelled.  I read some other reviewers mention that the sugar is what makes it gel so I imagine that in order to get the sweetness down I may need to sacrifice some of the thickness but I think it would be worth it.  I think I could always cut the sugar in half and then thicken if needed with corn starch.

This was a great recipe! Every year I make homemade cranberry sauce but haven't stuck to one recipe yet because they were all missing "something". I think I found it in this one! I read other reviews and used 1/2 cup of oj and 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 T of truvia which is equivalent to 1/2 cup of regular sugar. Lastly I added 2 pinches of ground cinnamon near the end of cooking which brought it all together. Overall I got several compliments and I'm using this one from now on. It's not too sweet and not too tart..just perfect!

Don't laugh. I was the gal who always bought the canned jellied cranberry sauce. This is the first time I ever made it myself, and I must say, I am now a convert! It was sweet,with just the right amount of zing! This will now be my go-to cranberry sauce recipe. Simple to make. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is very good, but it's way too sweet. I doubled it and added grand marnier at the suggestion of others, and it tasted fantastic, albeit with candy-like sweetness. It would be perfect otherwise. My family remarked that it tasted like drinking sugar syrup and the huge bowl remained virtually untouched, what a waste. :(

This is the perfect cranberry sauce especially with the minor previously suggested changes- 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, 1/4 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon, grated orange rind and 1/8 cup Grand Marnier.

I usually don't make cranberries because nobody eats it... However, wanted the color on the plate.  This recipe was EASY to make and everybody at the table ate it and went back for more on their seconds.   I will make this every year!

My gosh. This was the first time I've ever made cranberry sauce and it turned out wonderful!! I like my sauces thick so I cooked the cranberries longer and smashed them as they became softer. I didn't use as much sugar though and it came out a bit tart, which to me, tastes great. Thanks so much.

Thanks for posting this but unfortunately it wasn't to my liking. I tried cooking it as the recipe called and it ended up watery and overly sweet / orangey. I tried again at less than half sugar and OJ which was ok. I finally cooked up a bath with sugar, water and almost double the cranberries which was more my speed.

Just made this today and it turned out great!  I let it simmer a bit longer and made sure to help break up the cranberries with a spoon and then a potato masher. This seemed to help it thicken.

2016- use brown sugar instead of white & add1/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg & 1 tsp. cinnamon. After most berries have popped, use potato masher to smooth out & crush remaining whole berries = 5 stars!!

This recipe is decent as is, but it definitely did not have a complexity of flavor I was looking for, and I wanted to step it up. I added 1 cinnamon stick, several ground cloves, 1/2 tsp of fresh ginger, 1/8th tsp nutmeg, 1 star anise, a dash of vanilla, juice and rind of one lemon, rind of one orange, 1 C chopped walnuts, 1/2 C raisins, 1/4 C Grand Mariner. After those additions was it truly orgasmic.

This has been my recipe for quite a few years, it's great every time.  So simple, not too sweet, not too tart.  Sometimes I throw in a cinnamon stick during cooking if I have one on hand.

Fantastic! My first time ever making cranberry sauce, and the family LOVES it (after 22 years of serving the canned jelly type)!  This is a super-easy and quick recipe, though I recommend you refridgerate the sauce if you like it thick.
I read several reviews and modified the recipe a little based on their comments and our tastes. Instead of 1 cup OJ, I used 1/2 cup OJ and 1/2 cup no sugar lemonaid; Minute Maid Light 15 Calorie. This reduced the sweetness and added a bit of the tart back.  I also added 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar/juice combo, bringing it to bubble before adding the cranberries.  I stirred frequently while the berries were popping and then lightly mashed the mixture with my potato masher after removing the pan from the heat. Once it reached a simi-thick consistancy from cooling, I put it into the fridge overnight.  Total hit at dinner!

This is a great recipe but it definitely takes longer than 10 minutes for the cranberries to 'pop'. The end result is worth the wait though!

After reading all the positive reviews, I figured it would be outstanding! Using orange juice sounded like a good idea to this recipe. Unfortunately I thought it had a very overpowering taste of orange juice. I used Tropicana OJ. I will be looking for another recipe. Thanks anyway!

Cranberry sauce? How about awesome sauce?! I made this as is but after tasting decided it needed a pinch of cinnamon, orange zest, and a little extra sugar. Those slight adjustments made this recipe outstanding!!

I made this last night so that my family may enjoy for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  But. . . I may have to make more :)
This is so good and easy to make.  I let mine slow boil for about 15 minutes.  The last 5 minutes I added approx. 1/4 cup of Ginger brandy and after cooking I removed from the heat and added grated orange rind.  It will thicken as it cools.  I too will never buy store stuff again..  Thanks for the recipe.

Have been using this for several years now.  I do add some cinnamon to give it a bit more flavor but it really doesn't need it.  I cook for a bit longer to make it thicker.  We serve this warm for turkey as well as warm over top a cream cheese block with crackers for an snack while waiting for dinner.

After I made this cranberry sauce a couple of years ago, my family won't touch cranberry sauce from a can.  This is my go to move now when it comes to cranberry sauce. I am making it for pre-thanksgiving community dinner at our church today. I know they are gonna love it too!

Perfect cranberries!  I used 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup OJ and 1/2 cup water and cooked them a little longer.  I'll never buy canned again - it has high fructose corn syrup in it.

Great easy recipe. Is it the most complicated and hardcore recipe? No. But just take the 4 minutes of work it takes to make this and you will not be disappointed. I think I agree with a few other people that this could use a little less sugar. But that will depend on taste.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now. It is so easy and fun to make with my daughter. She loves it warm or chilled. We like to put it over ice cream or even on pancakes. I haven't made any modifications although the suggestions from other reviewers sounds good as well. Thank you for such an easy yet yummy recipe for those of us who aren't good cooks:)

Pretty good and easy to make. I cut sugar to a litle bit more than 3/4. I also use 3/4 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice (2 medium oranges make about 1 cup juice), plus 1/4 cup of Triple Sec after the sauce starts to boil. After I turn the heat off, I grate some orange zest. A side note. Craberries really pop!

11/26/15 Update Note: this year I spiced it up a little bit by cooking the sauce with 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of allspice, 1/8 tsp of ginger, and 1/8 tsp of clove. . I also add 1/2 of pomegranate. It has a lot of potential.

This recipe is amazing!  I made it today, adding the 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, doing the half and half sugar and added some orange zest.  I have to remember to double the recipe, because my daughter and I almost ate all of it before it even cooled.

Made this for Thanksgiving and started out with 1/2 cup of sugar and added as needed to taste. Alot of people would be happy with 1/2 cup and 1 whole cup is way too much. Try 1/2 cup and keep adding until you are happy. You may still need to mash your cranberries a little.

I love this recipe as a base for cranberry sauce. You can add anything else you'd like - jalapenos, cherries, strawberries, cream, etc. - to make this any way you'd like. You can decrease the sugar, substitute water for orange juice, whatever you prefer as well with this one. I love it and will keep it!

This was definitely not anyone's favorite. It was okay but in my house, especially for a holiday gathering, I expect wow factor from every food at my table.. This was disappointing but edible.

Im not sure if I did something wrong as I did follow the recipe exactly but I did not love this recipe. I ended up running out and getting frozen starwberries to cook and add to it. I used about a cup and a half of strawberries and although it was tasty I found the strawberries a little overpowering. I would make this recipe again, however I would cook it with the addition of 1 cup of strawberries.

I love this recipe because it is delicious, simple, and easy.  Similar to other reviewers, I found that the flavor is enhanced by adding 3tsp orange zest, 2tsp ginger, 1tsp cinnamon, and 6 allspice seeds.

I took the chance to try to make homemade cranberry sauce and found this recipe. It was outstanding! Since I am diabetic, just for myself, I will cut down the sugar just a bit but I still LOVED it! Thank you for sharing!

Oh, my goodness, what a treat! Having never had cranberry sauce that didn't come out of a can, and never with whole cranberries, this was a wonderful surprise for the whole family. The flavor was oustanding, and even family members that don't usually like cranberry sauce enjoyed it. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

I did love it.  I only had one orange to juice so I made up the difference using Satsuma's, the difference defintely came through.  I also used the zest from all the citrus I juiced.  I can see that the variations could be endless... add cinnamon stick, nuts, candied ginger, use different juices or juice combinations, splash in some liqueur, and on, and on, and on...  I'm a fan.

Delicious Cranberry sauce. My FIRST time making my own for the Christmas dinner.

     I will NEVER buy it again.

    Next time I will add a little cinnamon.

     People really liked it.

      THANKS.

This recipe keeps it simple!!  I love it!!  I'm usually a big fan of the canned stuff.  It's the only thing on our table which I feel, if it doesn't have the can rings around it, it's no good! ha! ha!  
But this recipe is the exception!  SO good!  I will definitely be preparing this for years to come!

This recipe was great, but it was a sweeter tasting cranberry sauce.  Several people at out thanksgiving table thought it was the best they had ever had, while others preferred a tarter less sweeter version.  I personally thought it was delish!

The first time I made this, it turned out alright--I think I just wanted a sweeter taste to it. However, the second time I used this recipe to put into a cranberry crumb pie (instead of using canned cranberries like the recipe called for), and it was absolutely wonderful!! I think the sweetness of the other components of the pie complimented this slightly more sour recipe beautifully.

I enjoyed this very much. I made it as written and cooked it about 5 minutes longer to make sure it would be thickened. It turned out great, and the orange flavor did not overpower but was a nice compliment. I will make again. Tasted great with the turkey, but also very nice with pork.

It's good, I've made it twice and been pleased. Use the full sugar amount! I reduced it 1/4 cup this last time because 1 cup seemed like so much, but you really need it to balance out the tartness of the cranberries.

So easy and so good.  Made exactly as written, other then cooking for a couple extra minutes to reduce some, then smashing some of the berries with the back of the spoon. Came out perfect.  Will be my go to cranberry sauce in the future.

I combined several of the helpful hints: 2 bags Cranberries, 2 cups OJ, 3/4 cup dark brown sugar (packed), 3/4 cup Natural Cane Sugar, 1/4 tsp Cinnamon.  Heat/dissolve sugars/cinnamon in OJ, add Cranberries and cook until it starts to thicken (about 30 minutes).  I made it the day before and it was GREAT!  The hint of cinnamon was just enough to perk your senses but you couldn't really taste it.  Cooking the cranberries should be anywhere from when they just start popping (about 10 minutes) to when they thicken depending on the desired consistency.  I have never cared for whole cranberries and have always had jellied.  This year no one ate the jellied cranberries!  Pam F.

By FAR the best cranberry sauce ever!!!  So easy to make, too - so no reason to ever buy canned sauce, again.  I took other reviewers advice and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  Also cooked until it was the desired thickness for my liking.  LOVED IT!!!

I'm embarrassed to say that I'm a foodie and am just venturing into the land of homemade cranberry sauce. I followed another user's suggestion and used half white sugar/half brown and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Next time, I'll reduce the OJ to half cup (some guests thought it was a tad bitter).  Such an easy recipe! Kudos!

I really liked this and it is super easy! Doesn't get SOLID solid but I liked the consistently.  Only used 3\4 of the sugar and glad I made the reduction as it wild have been way too sweet otherwise.

I made this for Thanksgiving, first time I tried making Cranberry sauce and it was excellent!  Even the kids liked it!  I used Xagave brand of agave nectar and used about 3/4 of a cup instead of sugar to make it a bit healthier and it tastes great!  I also added a bit of cinnamon and just a tiny bit of nutmeg per other reviews.  I will definitely make this again and probably never buy the canned stuff again!  REALLY, REALLY good and VERY easy to make!  I did make it about two days ahead of time, too, to cut down on work the day of and some reviews mentioned that the flavor gets better when made ahead of time... great idea!  Was still very tart even with the o.j., but I did use Great Value (Wal-Mart) brand that is a pretty sour o.j. so that may have helped.  Overall it did not seem too sweet, but was comparable to the canned stuff, just better and much healthier with the agave nectar.

Did as another reviewer suggested and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Got rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner.  I personally thought it was far superior to the "regular" water/sugar combination, but I also prefer a sweeter cranberry sauce.  Definitely a hit in our family...and will be making again!!

I made this for Thanksgiving; super easy and quick to make and everyone commented on how good it was. I thought it tasted a little too much of orange and did not thicken up as much as I would have liked. Next time I will try cooking a bit longer. It went well with ham and I would make it again.

How can something so simple taste so wonderful? I made it exactly as directed and everybody commented on how good it was. Previously I have tried a few elaborate and labor intensive recipes for cranberry sauce, but this is the recipe for me. It was simple and very, very good. The next I make it I may try it with just a little less orange juice ... perhaps 3/4 cup of oj and 1/4 cup of water just to see if I like it even better with just a little less orange in it.

As an experienced cook, I was a little concerned with the simplicity of this recipe, however it turned out GREAT !  I reduced the sugar to a little under half, used fresh squeezed juice, and let it simmer under a watchful eye! Like other reviewers, I used a potato masher to mash the cranberries. Everyone loved it, even those who typically do not like whole cranberry sauce.  You can push it through a seive using the back of a large spoon if you want a more jelly like sauce.  This is more time consuming and reduces the recipe to half what you cooked.  Using this recipe, there is no need to buy canned sauce.

Yummy!  I cut the sugar down to about 2/3 c. and that was perfect for us, it was tart still but not so tart it was inedible.

Very easy recipe with great results.  Find that the local organic cranberries have better flavor with the finished product.  Add a hint of cinnamon and ginger to my normal recipe.  Also do a second version that I add a touch of red pepper and fresh grated ginger for a little kick of heat.

This is a great recipe; it's just a little sweet for my taste. I gave it 4 stars because I did make some changes. I use 3/4 cup pineapple orange juice + 1/4 cup water, 3/4 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons light brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves. I also add the juice of half a lemon and some zest and cook it longer. It lightens it up a bit.

I cut the sugar in half as well as the orange Juice (1/2 cup of each) as I've been trying to cut back on sugar and it was just perfect! Plenty sweet! I also added some orange zest and a cinnamon stick while it was cooking which deepened the favors. My husband who will ONLY eat canned jellied type tried this right after it was cooked and still cooling and his words were, "this is the bomb- delicious!" He's now converted. Great recipe!

The only change I made was I threw a cinnamon stick in it.  I made it the day before I needed it and the flavors really blossomed over 24 in the refrigerator.  Great, simple recipe!

I made this last Thanksgiving and canned it in jelly jars as favors with placecards.  It was a hit, and so easy to make!  We made turkey panini with the cranberry sauce for the whole week after Thanksgiving.  I have this year's batch on the stovetop right now :)

This is my first time making Cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving. I never liked the fake canned stuff that my family always put out, so I figured I would try making it from scratch. I added a little cinnamon and brown sugar (as recommended by other reviews), this came out great! I will be making again next year!

Great recipe! I didn't have orange juice, so I used 1/2 C water and cut the sugar in half (using 1/4 C white and 1/4 C brown). I tasted it while it was cooling, and thought it needed a little zip, so I stirred in about a tablespoon or so of "Mighty Mango" Naked Juice. Now it's amazing! Before the mango juice, my daughter (who doesn't like cranberry sauce) said it was "ok", but now she loves it! I might need to make another batch!

I just made this...2 batches actually.  Having read the reviews after I made and tasted the first batch (followed exactly as written), it was a tad too sweet for me.

The second batch, I made, I only decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, some might want to go to 1/2 cup of sugar.  The second batch was perfect for my tastes.  I did cook the second batch for 13 minutes.  

All in all...EXCELLENT recipe.  Simple, flavorful and many thanks for sharing!!!

I did alter it a bit, however. 

Used 3/4 cup sugar rather than 1 full cup.

Used a cup of water rather than a cup of orange juice.

Added the processed fruit of one large navel orange, and the processed peel of 1/4 of that same orange. The orange fruit adds back flavor, the peel adds a bit of bite and consistency.

Once the cranberries started popping, I used a handheld processor to blend the mix right in the pan. Then simmered for another 15 minutes or so so that the mixture cooked down. 

My wife, who despises cranberry sauce, loved it! As did my daughter, and me, too. We all plan to use it on the turkey.

I just made this today for Thanksgiving tomorrow. It is fantastic. I can't help licking the ladle. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe and to all the reviewers who helped enhance it.
I used 14 oz. of fresh cranberries. I also used 3/4 cup orange juice and added 1/4 cup Grand Marnier to it. I reduced the sugar by half. It was tart and plenty sweet for me. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. Added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and voila! The best cranberry sauce ever. Last year, I had made a fancy cranberry sauce with port wine ($$) etc. and I just didn't want to spend so much money and energy on something this simple and delicious.

This is the BEST cranberry sauce I've EVER had! I made it with with a few adjustments. I took the advice of another reviewer and added Grand marnier, 1/4 cup per 12 oz. cranberries and cut the orange juice to 3/4 cup per 12 oz. cranberries.(I doubled the recipe). I aslo added the zest of one lemon to the orange juice, sugar, grand marnier mixture. After adding the cranberries, I added about a half cup of candied orange peel, I made them especially for this recipe. I think I have died and gone to HEAVEN! I can't wait for Thanksgiving this year, if it is this good now, I can only imagine what it will taste like after having a day or 2 to set up in the fridge :)

This is a great recipe with a lot of true cranberry flavor with hints of sweet and tart all mixed deliciously. I have made this recipe in its original portions and also made using Allrecipes change serving feature for about 100 people. Both times this simple recipe came out fantastic and everyone enjoyed it! For the larger portion I did add a little bit more Sugar and Orange juice to compensate for the longer time on the stove, still in equal portions, and it was still delicious! It also freezes well for future meal use, so it is a great make ahead dish!

This is hands down my favorite go to cranberry sauce! Even my mom makes this now. 
Only thing I do differently is add a stick of cinnamon to it as its cooking. Then remove it after its done and cooled. 
I usually make this the night before.

I did the suggestions of using some oranges crushed and half brown sugar and cooking longer to get it thicker. Wonderful...I lucked up on a deal on fresh cranberries last year making them cheaper than canned sauce so I bought enough for this year as well and they freeze wonderfully and since the low water content keeps them from getting soggy they are just like fresh.  My immediate family loves this as it is but my Dad is a die hard canned jellied sauce lover so I took half the recipe and added a can of jellied to it blending it well and my father practically inhaled it at a special Father's Day dinner so it is another new addition to this Thanksgiving menu.

In my family we add dried apricots right into the cooking process - it breaks up the flavors a little.  Other suggestions on Orange rind & spice should be used too.

This recipe is so easy to make, and I had so many compliments on it.  I used only 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the cranberries were still very sweet.

Who knew! So simple, such a good taste! I just wish I could strain the "stuff" better so I could get the "jellied can" smoothness with this great flavor. I'm going to cook another batch with a better strainer & see.

The first year I made this it was so tart that almost nobody ate it.  The second year I used more sugar and mixed white and brown sugar together and threw a whole cinnamon stick in with it while it cooked.  It went over much better.  I liked it tart but I like the sweeter version a little better.

I have used this recipe for 5 years and have never changed a thing.  I usually make this the day before Thanksgiving, so that it is chilled and thick. Grandma wont touch it unless it is icy cold.

This had great flavor!  I used slightly more cranberries - probably closer to 2 or 2 1/2 cups (about 3/4 of a 3 cup bag of frozen cranberries). I found this balanced out the sweetness from the sugar and orange juice. Next time I might also reduce the sugar amount.  I pureed the sauce for family preferences.

I've never made fresh cranberry sauce, always got the kind in a can. I found this recipe and WOW! I took another reviewers advice and only used 1/2 cup of orange juice. It turned out delicious and thickened nicely. Will be eating it tomorrow with my family. Absolutely delish!

I've been making cranberry sauce for many years and have always added orange zest.  Today I made it with the orange juice instead of water (plus a little zest) and my taste buds did a happy dance when I gave it the spoon taste.  Can't wait until tomorrow paired with the turkey.  Thanks!

Wonderful Recipe!!  I made jelled cranberries instead of sauce.  I made as is, using all white sugar.  I added two small shakes of cinnamon to the orange juice, sugar mixture.  I brought that to a boil, added the cranberries and boiled for 20 minutes.  At about 15 minutes, I mashed the cranberries in the pan.  At the end of the 20 minutes, I strained the mashed mixtured through a mesh strainer.  Using the back of a wooden spoon, I pressed the berries against the mesh strainer and continued to scrape off the pulp that came through into the bowl underneath.  I repeated this until I was left with little more than the skins in the strainer.  I covered my bowl of strained cranberries and refrigerated for about 30-45 min.  Excellent!

I was terrified to make a home-made cranberry sauce, but because of dietary needs, I can't have most canned cranberry sauces. I made this with Splenda, and it was fantastic!  Never will I buy a can of cranberry sauce again!

This is the easiest and best tasting sauce. I added a half cup of orange marmalade to the cranberries while they cooked. Gave it a little extra zing!

It's perfect! I normally don't like cranberry sauce at all but I had to clean the pot with my finger! It turned out not too runny because I boiled it a bit more after the pop sound ends. Yum :)

I made this for a family holiday dinner. Everyone loved it. The only thing different I did was to grate a little orange ride into the cranberries.

Wow, who would have thought that Orange Juice would be the magic ingredient that made this cranberry sauce so good?  I'm not normally a cranberry sauce fan, but this was fantastic.  I did cut the Orange Juice in 1/2 and added some water and a little extra sugar, but it was a hit at our Thanksgiving this year!

I tried this morning following the recipe faithfully, and it turned out great!  So easy to make and so good to taste!  I like the combination of tart-sweetness, and the texture is just right.  Thank you so much Toni for sharing!

This was amazing with just a few changes. I did as other reviewers and did half white and half brown sugar. I also added some spice; cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and lemon juice. Plus I don't like chunky cranberry sauce so after heating til cooked I blended it to a thicker, less chunky consistency. Delicious!!

This was my first attempt to make cranberry sauce from scratch and it came out PERFECTLY.  Even the people at Thanksgiving who aren't cranberry sauce fans loved this, but they'd only ever had it out of a can.  Seriously, you cannot screw this up and it's amazing.  Thank you!

Great recipe. As much as I hate when people give 5 star then say how they changed it... I am going to. Because the original recipe is good. I just use apple juice instead of orange and run it twice in my bread machine on the jam setting.

over the years i've experimented with cranberry sauce. ive added cherries, cinnamon, orange zest and orange juice. everyone who encountered my sauce has said that i should can it and sell it. cranberry sauce is great over ice cream! either way cranberry sauce is wonderful no matter how it is made!

Turned out fine, but I must admit, I still prefer the canned stuff. This either means that canned cranberry sauce is just that good, or that this recipe is lacking something. I tend to believe that it is the latter.

This is such an easy, quick, and delicious recipe! My family and I will never eat cranberry sauce from a can again. This sauce had just the right amount of sweetness and thickened nicely. Thanks for a great recipe!

As my little niece says, "nummy, nummy". EVERYONE thought I was soooo talented to have made this from scratch, even those who dont like cranberry sauce (myself included) liked the taste of this one. Almost easier than opening the canned version. Whatever you do, don't walk away from this while it's cooking. It only takes a minute to start boiling all over the place.

Wow these were fabulous.  Made these yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner and my family loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I used 1/2 cup orange juice and it turned out just perfect.  Once the cranberries started to pop, I mashed my cranberries.  Will definately make this again next year.

Incredibly easy to make.  I didn't have the time to let it sit and cool and thicken, so my husband added a little water with cornstarch.  It's also very sweet so just make sure everyone likes that.

Thanks for this delicious recipe!  I took the first reviewer's recommendation and mixed brown and white sugar, but I only used 1/2 cup total and 1/2 cup orange juice.  Perfect!

I will never buy canned cranberry sauce again! This recipe was easy and fun to make.  I took the advise of others and cooked it  a little longer, mashed a few of the berries for more texture, halved the sugar between brown and white, and added a few teaspoons of orange zest.  The one extra thing that I added was a 1/4 cup of ripe mango.  I didnt have any gran marnier so I splashed a little brandy in at the very end.  Absolutely fantastic recipe!  Thanks fo for sharing everyone!

Made this today (Thanksgiving) for the first time. It was fantastic. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and called it a day! The family went nuts. My son had 3 servings and he hates cranberry sauce.

I must give this recipe five stars because I have NEVER had cranberry sauce in my life. Growing up, it was on the table but it was this "canned jelly" thing... Anyway, I LOVED THIS w/ todays Thanksgiving Meal.  Easy recipe, great as is. Good Job Toni :)

Excellent!! Normally I hate it when people change a recipe then give it a rating based upon the changes but since others have already suggested changes, I feel free to offer my own. I, too, used 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup water, 1 cup white sugar, and since we like it sweet I added 1/2 brown sugar. I also cooked this with 2 small cinnamon sticks which I removed when done. One word of caution. DO NOT LEAVE THIS while cooking. As another reviewer warned--I should have listened. I put it on the stove with a lid on, turned the burner on and as it started to heat, I left the room for not more than 90 seconds! When I returned it had boiled all over my stove!  But the final product was excellent. I will make this from now on. No more canned stuff. Thanks

Yummy nummy yum!  I don't like cranberry sauce - well, I can't really say that.  I don't care for such intensely sour fruits all that much, so I've never tried any (the canned stuff looks unappealing).  But I just made this for a Thanksgiving party I'm having on saturday (I'm an American in Finland, so none of the guests have thursday off).  This is SO DELICIOUS!  I love it!  I followed a couple of modifications others suggested.  I put 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white.  I put only 3/4 C orange juice, and added .01 liter of cointreau (I couldn't find a small bottle of grand marnier).  Oh I'm so happy I made this!  I love finding new foods!

This is good, but I agree with other reviewers that there is too much orange juice in it, unless you are trying to mask the flavor of the cranberries.  I even used 1/2c OJ and 1/2c water and the flavor was still too strong.  I added some cranberry juice to take away some of the OJ flavor.  It made it better, but I think next time I will only use 1/4c at the most.

Very good, although I changed it. I just can't leave a recipe alone. I followed others' suggestions and used half brown sugar, half white sugar. I doubled the cranberries and nearly doubled the sugar after tasting, but left the OJ at 1 cup. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon.

This recipe is fantastic. We also tried it adding a chopped up apple and then when it was done we added cinnamon and pureeing it and it made amazing apple/cranberry sauce!

I made this while by husband and sons were outside decorating for Christmas.  It never made it to the fridge to chill for tomorrow.  They liked it warm.  I doubled the batch and used brown sugar and white sugar like another review stated.  Now I have to make another batch to see how it turns out when chilled.  They have already told me they don't want to wait for another holiday to have it.  Thanks for sharing.

Well I made this cranberry sauce for my guests for Thanksgiving tomorrow- I do NOT like cranberries (!) and I actually really like this! It is just sweet enough. I honestly never thought I would like cranberry sauce but this recipe proved me wrong :) The only problem I had is that my cranberries NEVER popped at all. I boiled for about 20 minutes total and then took it off the heat and just mashed the berries with a large spoon. It worked just fine, it has a nice thick consistency.

Wonderful! I took the advice of a previous review and used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and a touch of cinnamon! My husband loved it and he hates cranberry sauce!

I love this, it is soooo easy. However I am not a big fan of the orange-cran flavor so here's what I do for a very special one: 3/4 c. water and 1/4 c. chambord instead. adds a  wonderful raspberry flavor instead and the alcohol cooks out if there are any guests sensitive to alcohol.

I found this recipe because I was wondering if I could use regular orange juice in place of the water, instead of my usual addition of frozen oj concentrate to the water. I guess so! Thanks for the recipe.

Substitute Splenda(R) for the sugar if you are diabetic like myself.  Also I like a bit more orange flavor so I add a little bit of orange zest.  Good to the last spoonful.

This is a great cranberry sauce recipe. It's simple but so good. I always add a cinnamon stick while cooking. Sometimes I even add a splash of grand marnier or a couple TBS. of orange marmalade.

Thank you allrecipes.com -- another recipe to the rescue.  Just made this dish, and after looking through some of the reviews, I cut back a little on the juice and added a touch of cinnamon and some orange zest.  Yummy!

I don't eat cranberry sauce and I found myself tasting and tasting it.  Really good, four stars because it's a tad sweet, cut back on the sugar a little, otherwise really nice addition to the turkey day table

This is really quite similar to my recipe.  One thing that helps cranberry sauce taste a wee bit milder is adding chopped up pear.  It tones the sauce down and makes it look pretty too!  I also suggest adding about 4 whole cloves and one or two cinnamon sticks.

I made it according to directions but it came out a little thick and too tart.  If I try making it again I think I will add some spices and additional OJ or water. Very easy to make though!

Delicious! I didn't use to like cranberry sauce until I had this! I made it just as the recipe says, and it was perfect. It was so good that I was constantly looking for things to put it on (so I'd have an excuse to eat it)... turkey sandwich, pancakes, waffles, toast, yogurt, etc., etc., etc.! Enjoy!

The colour was beautiful, but it tasted way too much like orange juice once I got to the end. Normally I like my cranberry sauce a little tart. Next time I'd use a little less. Also I mixed about a tablespoon of cornstarch into a little OJ and added it to make it jelly faster. It was a perfect consistency when we ate about two hours later!

So good and so easy!  I took the suggestions and did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also added the juice and zest of one orange.  The only down side to this recipe is that it is a little loose, not really "set" like canned cranberry sauce.

I dissolved about 2/3 cup Splenda in 1 cup of orange juice.  I then added a 10 oz package of frozen cranberries and let them simmer for about 15 minutes.  Taking other reviews into consideration, I used a potato masher to mash the cranberries.  Finally, I mixed a heaping spoonful of cornstarch with an additional 1/3 cup of orange juice and added that to thicken the sauce and shot a squeeze of lime juice in too.  I use the sauce as a spread for sandwiches.  It's fantastic!

Great, quick recipe! I never had homemade cranberry sauce until I made this recipe and neither did anyone in my family. I made in for Christmas and people couldn't believe how delicious it was! Make sure you use a splatter guard!

I have been making my own cranberry jelly for years now. I have always used a whole bottle of Riesling and a few herbs, but this was simple cheap and delicious. I love tart cranberries so if you would like them sweeter make sure to add more sugar and maybe some vanilla to dull the tartness.

Absolutely wonderful, never again will i have canned cranberrie sauce! My dad is picky and he loved this. Very easy to make. I did use the suggestion of 1/2 cup orange juice, instead of the full cup.

I hadn't made cranberry sauce before as my parents had always bought it in the can, and they usually forgot about it until mid-meal. Anyway this Christmas I decided to try this recipe and my family absolutely loved it. It's so easy to make. I added 2 cinnamon sticks. Watch that you don't let your pot boil over - it's a messy clean up if you don't catch it in time! I let this cool completely to thicken up and then heat it up just before dinner time. I'll definitely make this again.

This was my first time ever making cranberry sauce and it was a HIT at Thanksgiving. Even when I made it I couldn't help but keep eating spoonfulls because the taste was so good. I used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 OJ 1/2 water like other reviewers suggested. I will NEVER buy cranberry sauce again, this was too easy and too delicious!!

Fantastic cranberry sauce. The taste is sparkling, neither too tart nor too sweet. Quick and simple to cook. With this recipe in hand, there's no excuse for serving a canned substitute.

Turned out really well. Mashed the cranberries with a potato masher and it gave just the right consistency. The friends I made it for all said that it was the best they'd tasted. They usually had just used canned stuff but said they'd be trying this next time they needed some cranberry sauce.

I love it.  I make it just as written and it is a staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  No one would touch cranberry sauce until I started to make this recipe and now there is never enough.  Edit:  For my own information:  This year I added a tablespoon of pomegranate vinegar.  As much as the recipe is AWESOME without it, it really added a great depth of flavor.

Guests who had never cared for cranberries ate this up at Thanksgiving. So easy. I used fresh berries and "Simply Orange" juice. It was a kick watching theberries slowy pop open.

Simple recipe, orange adds a  light  zest and compliments cranberries perfectly.. and absolutely LOVED by everyone, even the skeptics!  Now a staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas. After having done this recipe MANY times, I have now started making it with ALOT less sugar, just our preference.

Simple and delicious!  I added a bit of cinnamon; otherwise, the recipe is perfect.  I didn't have any trouble with it being too runny.

Made this for Thanksgiving exactly as written. Turned out perfect. Those of us at dinner who like cranberry sauce thought this was excellent!  Next year I might try the orange zest and gran marnier additions.

I love this recipe! it was totally easy and tasted very nice - plus, I forgot about it on my stove and cooked it for oh, about 30 minutes, and it was just fine! I like recipes that are hard to mess up!

Soooo delicious!  It's close enough to some of the canned sauce that most people who like the canned stuff will like this.  My 8 year old nephew loved it.  After cooking everything, I ran it through the food processor for a few seconds, just to make it saucier.  I'm going to make a triple batch while there are still cranberries in the stores and put it in the freezer.

Following other reviewer's suggestions, I added 1 tsp. of orange zest & 1/8 cup Gran Marnier. (I also used Splenda for the diabetics in the family.) Prepare a day ahead--this is outstanding!

First time cooking Thanksgiving dinner... made this and it was a HUGE hit.  I usually make my food as is, then change the recipe, but since this was gonna be for Thansksgiving, I changed it a bit first time out.  Used 1/2 cup oj, 1/2 cup water, everything else is the same.. and it was GOOD!  I don't like cranberry sauce, but I ate this one.  And everyone loved it, even the two other people that don't like cranberry sauce!  Very easy, made it in the AM and put it in the refrigerator until about 30 minutes before all the food was ready!

Very simple and very excellent. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and cut the amount of orange juice used in half. I made sure to mash the berries with the back of a spatula as the sauce thickened and refrigerated overnight before using. The guests loved it!

I was rather worried about trying whole cranberry sauce because I know cranberries are very tart and untasty by themselves, but NEVER AGAIN will I go back to canned cranberry sauce!  I doubled the recipe, followed some advice and did half brown, half white sugar and used orange, pineapple and a tbsp. lemon juice and it was PERFECT.  My pop added the peel of an orange, and a cinnammon stick overnight and removed right before serving.  The flavors were tangy, sweet, subtle, and undeniably harvesty.  It wasn't bitter and it was EVEN BETTER with turkey leftovers days later.  Cranberries are so cheap and plentiful at this time of year, everyone should at least TRY this recipe.  :)

This is very good! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white. The longer you boil the berries the more it will have a jam consistency.

This is very similar to the recipe I have used for a long time. Instead of orange juice I use water pretty much follow the directions given. I prefer a softer version of cranberry sauce and by cooking less time[8-10 mins] I have a softer sauce. Less pectin is released and for my tastes, this is just perfect! Love it on leftover turkey [open-faced] sandwiches.  Once I made fresh cranberry sauce, I decided it definitely has a much better taste and we prefer that.

Hard to rate this one. I personally dont like cranberry sauce. Made this for thanksgiving dinner. My very honest sister said it was a lil bitter. I told her i used orange juice and she thought that maybe that caused the bitterness. Oh well. Guess i will give it a 4.

I have never thought about making my own cranberry sauce, always just used the cans.  But this quick and easy recipe has changed my mind!  It tased so much better than the canned, granted the consistancy is a lot different so if you don't like chunks then it probably isn't for you.  But I loved it and will be making it every Thanksgiving from here on out!

I normally do not care for cranberry sauce but I love this recipe! I ended up using half fresh orange juice and half apple juice, due to my lack of oranges in the house. Added some orange zest and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Yum! I also mashed it in a sieve when it had cooled a bit. I just haven't graduated to whole cranberry sauce. This technique worked great as it made the sauce a nice balance between whole cranberry sauce and jellied cranberry sauce.

This was good. I had to cook it twice and it was still a bit runny. Followed suggestions and used half brown sugar and then added cinnamon during the second boiling I did of it.  Not much was eaten but no one really touched the canned stuff either.

This was a hit at my house on Thanksgiving! I don't like cranberry sauce and I even liked it! My grandparents absolutely loved it and I will definitely use again next year.

I have never tried cranberry sauce and I meant to the Thanksgiving but I had so much food I didn't get around to it. But, my cranberry sauce loving husband said it was much better than the canned stuff and it got gobbled right up so I'm assuming it was wonderful, lol. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was not a fan of cranberry sauce until I tried this recipe. I made it the day before Thanksgiving and put it in the fridge until about 2 hours before we ate. Set it out on the counter, stirred and viola! Delicious

I think the key is the orange juice!  Everyone loved this cranberry sauce... my parents were so impressed!  They both said that they have never really loved cranberry sauce, but they loved this one!  They even said it was better than my Grandma's (she was a great cook, so this is a great compliment... love you, Grandma!).  But, this recipe is definitely a keeper!  I added a dash of cinnamon like one reviewer said and it did add just a nice hint of cinnamon.  If I'm brave next year, I'll use 1/2 C of white sugar and 1/2 C of brown sugar, but the recipe is wonderful as written!  Thanks for a great holiday this year!!! :)

The flavor was fantastic, though I did add a small amount of nutmeg and cinnamon due to personal preference.  My only qualm is that the directions say to remove the sauce pan after the cranderries start to pop.  I did this, but I think I should have left it on longer.  This never properly thickened and I believe it is because not enough cranberries popped, so there wasn't enough pectin released.  I will try again.

I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I did differently was I left it on the stove for an extra minute or two. This sauce was so good, the orange juice really helps take away the tartness of the cranberries. Everyone loved it -- a great addition to the Thanksgiving meal!

Maybe it was my cranberries but mine was a little bit so I just added about a 1/4 cup more sugar. I also cooked it with a cinnamon stick. It was delicious and made a nice jelly texture. Very good recipe.

This cranberry sauce was excellent. It was also very easy to make. There were two things that I did differently...first I added a little bit of orange zest to the mixture and I also added a cinnamon stick to the sugar and orange juice mixture.

I have never made homemade cranberry sauce before, and this was a perfect one.  Easy and delicious, with plenty for sandwiches to go with the leftover turkey.

DELICIOUS and EASY :) I made this for Thanksgiving and my 10 year old nephew took some home with him since he liked it so much. I agree with the other reviews MUCH better then canned. Thank you for a great recipe

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I added 1/4 cup of Gran Marnier as it finished cooking.  I thought this gelled nicely, although I cooked it a little longer.  I was slightly bland...missing something, though I haven't figured out what yet.

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I followed the advice of other women who used half white and half brown sugar, along with a pinch of cinnamon.  The cinnamon provides a nice balance between the tartness of the berries and the sweetness of the sugar.  It is really delicious.

I was asked to bring cranberry sauce for this year's dinner. I don't even like cranberry sauce. The only change I made was to cook it a little longer for thickening purposes...about 15 minutes. This is absolutely delicious!!!!!
Update: made this again this year by request. This time I double the batch, only used about 1 and 2/3 cups of sugar, and added 2 tablespoons of home made applesauce (for the cinnamon/spice content and also thickening) and a generous splash each of brandy and triple sec. I added the last two after I took it off the heat, but the brandy was a little overpowering so I put it back on the heat for about 10 minutes. Cooling now and thickening nicely. YUM.

Great! Did about 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. Snuck a little taste once it had cooled...so good! Hopefully it makes it until tomorrow without me eating it all ;)

Wow! This is great! I never have really been into cranberry sauce, but I have to say this is so yummy! A little goes a long way. I made it 2 days ahead of time for Thanksgiving as one review said it froze nicely. I will make this a tradition with my daughters to make every year. I was a little confused as to how many cranberries to pop, would it be one, two, or half? I didn't know. So I went ahead and guessed at 1/4. I still don't know if this is right. But I wanted it to look as good as it tastes. It's a keeper!

The best! So much better than canned and so easy to make! For a more gelatin like sauce, add one package of plain gelatin to the mixture.  I make it every year for   thanks giving.

This was the first homemade cranberry sauce I've ever made, overall the taste was good, I just thought it needed a bit more sweetness. I will use the grand mariener sauce next time, and there will definetly be a next time! Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy! I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and a bit less than 1/2 cup of white, and 1/2 cup of oj. It turned out excellent, tart but perfect. It gelled perfectly too.

This was everything it was advertised to be!  I made it for 12 friends at a "pre-Thanksgiving" dinner and as I did not have any Grand Marnier around, added 1/4 cup of pomegranate vodka instead.  Yum, Yum, Yum!! Everyone raved about it.  I am making it again but adding the Grand Marnier just to see how that tastes.

This dish was a hit with everyone at Christmas dinner, even those that aren't so fond of cranberries. I added half a pint of crushed blackberries to the original recipe.

This cranberry sauce was excellent! I also added Grand Marnier as per earlier reviews, but I only added 1/8 cup. Very tasty, everyone loved it at Christmas dinner.

This was very easy to make.  A very good substitute for the ol' can of sauce!  I will make one change next time...it was a little tart for my family's taste.  Instead of using one cup sugar use 1 and a half.  My friend used this recipe too and that change made it turn out better.

Fantastic results! Although, I must say, I ventured down the route of the cabernet version by adding 1/2 cup of red wine and also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Turned out to be the best cranberry sauce ever.

I have never tried crandberry sauce before and this Thanksgiving I was asked to bring it to the family gathering.  HUGE hit! I loved it! I used it as jelly for turkey sandwhiches with the leftover turkey.  I added on 1/2 cup OJ, and a couple cinnamon sticks. YUMMY!

Excellent, however I made it low carb by replacing the sugar with splenda, a little less then sugar.  I didn't have orange juice so I used water and a shot of lime instead and we loved it!  It still thickened with the splenda, great low carb alternative.

I've never attempted making this homemade,, however, because of my war on High Fructose Corn syrup in every canned product... This will become my traditional recipe for the Holidays.  I also incorporated it to our traditional gelatin salad recipe.. it was a big hit with the family!

I always thought cranberry's grew in a can, however this fresh version was ineffable! My friends nor I have  been fond of the jellied tradition, but it palys an important part of Turkey day so I made it. I didn't have any regular oragne juice, so i used a pineapple/ orange blend which turned out great. it took about 10 minutes total to make, and i let it cool for a minute before taking a fork to smack the pulp. At first I though to take the cranberry skin out, but it was tender and gave the sauce more consistency. I would make this again!

don't add the "extras". I'll try this again plain, but so far, not impressed.

It's unbelievable how this simple recipe could taste so good! 
I did use the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 orange juice & 1/2 water. And I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.
I also added about a tablespoon of marmalade, a pinch of allspice, and a pinch of nutmeg. 
Next time I'm going to add some walnuts...

This was so yummy.  I didn't realize how good homemade cranberry sauce was.  My  husband loved it so much. I thought about adding some grand marinier as another reviewer suggested, but didn't have some so i thought I'd try some of our Jamaican Pineapple rum (got to use it up) that we brought from a trip to Jamaica. It was very good, I only added a little bit about 1/4 cup.  I cooked the sauce longer .

I made this for Thanksgiving for my family.  Very easy, quick and delicious!  I followed someone else's advice and used my potato masher to mash up the cranberries after all of the popped.  Made a nice, thick and very yummy sauce.  I made in the morning and chilled in the fridge for an evening meal....was perfect!

Very good--just made a few changes. Did equal parts OJ/water and added a pinch of cinnamon. Also let it cook for like 20 minutes to ensure all were popped.

WONDERFUL!  Made it for Thanksgiving dinner for 18 of us and everyone loved it, even the children!  I doubled it and served it out of a trifle bowl.  This recipe is a keeper.

I don't eat cranberry sauce with my turkey so I've always just put out the canned stuff for those who do.  This year I tried this recipe and it is amazing!  I cooked it a bit longer for a thicker consistency and then mashed the cranberries with my potato masher.  I still don't eat cranberry sauce with my turkey, but all of my guests LOVED IT.  For me, it is wonderful on an english muffin for breakfast!

I grew up with the jellied cranberry sauce -- it came to the Thanksgiving table still shaped like the can.  After I got married, my New England Yankee mother-in-law insisted that the cranberries had to be freshly cooked for Thanksgiving dinner.  So I've been using this recipe for years and it's simply the best!  It's both sweet and tart with that fresh burst of cranberry flavor.  If you want to bring out the orange flavor, you can add a little orange zest.  You can also add nuts at the start of cooking -- walnut or pecan pieces or slivered almonds -- if you want to add some extra texture.

This was okay. I think I should have cooked it longer than the recommended time to make it thicker, because it was just a little too runny for my taste (and apparently for everyone else's taste, too, as they tended to go for the canned cranberry sauce I brought as backup!).  I liked the ideas about adding some sort of liqeur at the end, I may try that sometime to make it more flavorful...it was just a little too tart, not sweet enough. Wasn't horrible, though.

Absolutly fabulous!  Definately use 1/2 white and 1/2 cup firmly pressed brown sugar, 3/4 OJ and 1/4 cup Grand Marnier and add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I made the full 11 servings for 8 and could have used more.  Have never made cranberry sauce myself but have eaten lots of homemade in the past.  This is superb and so easy.

This was awesome and so easy to make.  I used splenda and cooked about 30 minutes to what I considered to be a good consistancy......was perfect.  Nice and tart and so much healthier than the canned junk. It's great because you can control the tartness or sweetness as you like by adjusting the quantities of the ingredients.

I grew up on the canned sauce and will never go back to it! There is no comparison. This is fantastic and incredibly fast and easy.  I made it the night before and chilled it in the refrigerator, tasted wonderful Thanksgiving day. 
thanks for sharing this!!!

OMG OMG OMG OMG!  The flavor was amazing.  I love cranberry sauces from a can. I know.  But now that I've made this, I'm told I HAVE to keep making this recipe.  Very easy, did the recipe with a few dashes of cinnamon.  So good.

This was so simple-I will definitely be using this recipe every year from now on.  I worried it might be too sweet, so I just used 1/2 C sugar and it turned out great.  I was surprised how thick this ended up being after chilling.  Oh, and I didn't mash it up at all, as some reviewers did-I really liked the chunky consistency just the way it is.

Next time, I might try adding a bit of Grand Marnier, as some suggested.

This was so super easy and absolutely delicious!!! The only thing I did different was start out with a 1/2 cup of brown sugar then added a 1/4 cup of white sugar after tasting. I also mashed them a little with a potato masher in the pot. Wonderful!!!

We used 1/4 cup water and 3/4 cup of 100% Tropicana Valencia Orange Juice with Mango. Changed the level of tartness just a little. The kids liked it this way much more. Thanks!

my first not from a can cranberry sauce and I thought it was pretty easy. I did half white sugar and half brown as per reviews. I cooked it a lot longer for a thicker sauce. I will try grand marnier next time!

Good cranberry sauce!  I used to have canned sauce growing up, but fresh is great!  I must admit though, that due to growing up on canned, I like canned and fresh equally… :)  This was an easy and good recipe though.  I used half brown sugar and half white, along with a dash of cinnamon.  I may add a bit less orange juice next time as I felt that the sauce was a little runny and didn’t solidify as much as I would have liked.

Pretty good, would use a tad more sugar (I prefer the taste of sweeter cranberries like the dried ones) easy to make and stores well of course.  It is also very good presentation-wise with a little orange slice artfully displayed on top!

This recipe is simply delicious. It is so easy to make and tastes divine! I did reduce the orange juice just a little as it helped to give it a sturdier consistency. We ate the leftovers on english muffins - mmmmm, too good!

Very good, i had never made cranberry sauce before I didn't know it could be so easy to make something so much better than the stuff in a can.

Classic recipe! I changed the 1 cup white sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. Very easy. Very good!  I had to cook every dish this year, so having an easy delicious cranberry sauce recipe was a lifesaver.  I'll never use the canned sauce again.  Thanks!

This was great! We really like the orange taste the juice provided! So easy too. We aren't big fans of sweet things so I may try reducing the sugar next time to see what that yields. It was really wonderful and so easy too!!

FANTASTIC!!!! No more cans for me. I used Peach Schnapps instead of GM from a reviewer and it was a grand slam. My husband who is not a cranberry sauce at all has converted. :)

I don't care for cranberry sauce but I made this for my mom and my mother in law for Thanksgiving.  They loved it.  I actually followed the advice of some of the reviewers and added Grand Marinier.  It must have been good because my mom took it home with her.  Good recipe.

Too easy, and lets you control your sugar, too. Never buy the canned stuff again, with its high fructose corn syrup!

Thank you!!!! It was such a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner, people almost finished the whole thing and they also wanted to take home the leftover! I didn't change anything, it was perfect. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Not sure what I did wrong, but this did not gel at all even after 7 hours in the fridge. Some at my Thanksgiving table liked it though. I didn't.

So easy and so good! Like others have said, I will never buy canned again (I don't think my husband will let me anyway). My mom handed me a bag of cranberries yesterday and told me to bring my sauce to Christmas dinner. Hee hee, no problem! It's easy enough!

This is so ridiculously easy.  I used half OJ half water, and decreased the sugar to my taste.  

I hate canned cranberry sauce - this tastes like real cranberries, is a cinch to prepare, and is quite tasty.

This recipe had a very good flavor.  The sauce wasn't as thick as I expected. I couldn't tell when the cranberries 'popped' so just cooked them until they had cooked down some.

This was very good and EASY, although, I could taste more orange than cranberry.  I think much better when left to sit at least a full day.
