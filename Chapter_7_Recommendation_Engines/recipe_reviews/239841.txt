I reduced the recipe to 2 servings and thinly sliced both the sweet potatoes and squash.  What I found was boiling the potatoes and squash in a very small amount of heavy whipping cream isn’t possible.  So I ended up using 1/2 cup cream plus 1/4 cup whole milk in order for my potatoes and squash to have liquid to get tender in.  I used a small amount of ground thyme as I didn’t have fresh or dried.  I placed into a casserole dish added the cream and topped with panko and asiago.  We did like the flavor and if I make this dish again it would be with some changes. We did not like the additional cream before adding to the oven - it made them too thick/creamy.  The asiago cheese was a little too crunchy for our tastes.
