I was hesitant to try a cake recipe calling for 3 tablespoons of baking powder. I should have trusted my instincts, because half of the cake batter ended up overflowing onto the bottom of my oven. Perhaps it was supposed to be 3 teaspoons?? Very disappointing and a big mess to clean up!

I altered this recipe slightly, and created a cake I was very happy with. I thought the butter flavor might compete with the cherry flavor, so I used 1/2 cup Crisco instead of 1/2 cup of the butter. I also added about 1/8 cup extra cherry juice because the batter's cherry flavor wasn't strong enough for me. 

The cake turned out nice and moist. In a bundt pan, it took about 50 minutes to bake. It still barely had enough cherry flavor for me, but everyone who tried it liked it. The texture was great.

In the future, I would use almond flavor instead of vanilla (but maybe only 2 tsp so it's not overpowering). Also, I would at least double the amount of cherry pieces--the pieces were few and far between.

Overall, a great cake that's easy to make!

I believe this recipe has been updated since the last review.  Anyway, this cake is wonderful.  I made it for a friend's birthday and it received rave reviews.  Its moist and tasty.  I used buttercream icing and next time I'll use chocolate buttercream.  This cake cooked in about 30-35 minutes.

This was a good moist cake.  I don't have access to maraschino cherries, but I did use canned cherries that I found in my local grocery.  The cherries were packed in water, whick I used in the recipe.  Overall, I don't think the cake was as sweet without the maraschino cherries, but it worked really well.  I used a buttercream icing with this cake, and my company raved about the cake and icing.  If I find maraschino cherries, I will definitely try this recipe using those.

I was not impressed by this cake at all.  I used it to make cupcakes (solving the not-enough-cherries problem by adding an extra cherry to each cupcake).  I think, had I used a box cake mix, with the same cherry idea, I would have been much more pleased.  This cake came out very thick and dry - not really a good combination!!!  And very bland.  I added cream cheese frosting, and that helped a bit - but I wanted cherries with my cream cheese, and this recipe simply did not cut it.

This cake is a great party cake!  It's relatively moist, has a great cherry taste, and is very pink and festive.

This cake had an excellent flavor, but why was mine dry and heavy?  I would like to use it again, but it was not moist and it was heavy.  Please help!

This cake was ok... The texture is a bit corse/dry for my liking. I prefer the moist light cakes or a bunt style. This cake had the texture of cornbread. I even brushed a bit of cherry juice on each layer and used a butter cream frosting because the cake alone is not very sweet. It wasn't terrible, but I don't think I will make it again. Sorry....

The best I ever tasted.  I did omit the cherries in the cake, because I also used a cherry frosting and added the cherries there. Used a 9 x 13 pan for 45 minutes.
 After the cake was baked I used the recipe for cherry frosting also found in allrecipes, and that was a five star also.

This cake came out a little dry in my opinion but very tasty.  A bit of simple syrup soaked into the cake fixed the dryness. Totally make this cake again.

There is something missing with this recipe.  The amount of liquid to dry ingredients is off, and produced such a dry cake, that we couldn't even take the cherry.

Mine came out extremely dry. I see in the reviews the 1 cup of milk is missing from the recipe. I didn't know. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I added extra cherry juice for more flavor and I iced it with maraschino buttercream and topped with walnuts. Other then it being dry, the flavors were there and I used 2-9 inch rounds. I baked them for 40 minutes, but think it coulda been 35 not the recipes 45. I will try it again

Mine was dense. I looked back over the recipe  and didn't forget anything.  I don't know why it happened.

I also used this recipe for cupcakes; it turned out very dry and lacking on cherry flavor. I like the general concept, but I'm not experienced enough yet to know how to fix it...

Disappointing. The color was beautiful, but the cherry flavor was not very intense even though I added extra juice and cherries. It was also a bit dry...I may have overbaked it slightly. I used a white chocolate icing.
