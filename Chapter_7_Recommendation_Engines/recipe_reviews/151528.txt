This was exactly what I was looking for.  So good!  I used cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have any cream of celery.  I'm sure it would taste great either way.  I doubled the pepper and I added 1/2 can of milk to the soup mixture.  I also browned my pork chops in olive oil and added salt and pepper to taste on the chops while they were browning.  Used 8 oz of egg noodles.  It was too much. 6 oz would probably do.

The recipe did not say if you should mix the soup as directed on the can or not.  I mixed the pepper, soup, and honey.  The mixture was entirely too thick.  I then added a little water to make it more able to bring to a boil.  The stuff did not even look appitizing.  My husband would not even try it.  It was ok, but nothing to write home about.

I used cream of mushroom soup and a 1/2 can of milk to make the gravy creamier.  It was kind of like a pork chop stroganoff.  We really enjoyed it - the chops were so juicy and tender!  And it was really pretty easy!

This was so easy to prepare.  I used about a half cup of water and followed the recipe exactly because I was in a hurry.  My husband and I thought it was  good but when I make it again I will brown some onions add a little garlic and try using mushroom soup.

This is the first time I've ever rated anything or wrote a review! I've tried this before-from the label-and it is very good! Very simple & quick. Easy to do in the crock-pot as well. Add some onion when you brown the chops and a few more seasonings of your choice. Slowly cooking it in the oven is nice too. I added a little too much milk this time, so becareful. I have also used this recipe with mashed patatos instead of noodles.  My family enjoys it no matter how I cook it! Enjoy!

I seasoned the chops with salt & pepper, browned them, and then removed from pan and tented with foil while I sauteed some onions, garlic, and mushrooms.  I then added the soup and thinned it with some milk.  I placed the chops back in and completed the recipe.  I forgot to add the honey and I'm glad; in hindsight I don't think it would have worked.  Tasted great over mashed potatoes too!

This was my first time with this sort of pork chop recipe. The family enjoyed it. I used Cream of Mushroom soup since I knew that would go over better with our tastes. I seasoned the chops with a garlic salt/parsley combo and pepper during the browning phase. I would recommend this recipe as an easy meal.

I had the same experience as Jilll Simmons.  I started off using the Condensed Cream of Celery with no water or milk.  I saw this was not looking good, and read calebzmom's advice of 1/2 can of milk.  After I got that mixed well, things were a little better.   Next time, I would use Cream of Mushroom or some other Cream soup.  This is my first time using Cream of Celery and the color (especially) and texture combination is NOT a pleasing one.  Would try again with this modification.

Very very blah. Used this recipe in a pinch and couldn't get the kids to eat more than 2 bites.

I have not been pleased with pork chop recipes like this in the past, but I decided to go ahead and try this one because I had made something else and had more than half a can of Cream of Mushroom soup to use, and I had some pork chops, and was in a hurry - so this seemed like a good recipe to try. I used a lot of salt and pepper, as well as some garlic and onion when saut√©ing the chops. I used a little milk with the soup, and did use the honey and was very generous with the pepper. I served it with buttered noodles, which was a good match. Quick and simple, definitely one I'll use again.

I added the 1/2 can of milk to cream of celery & none of us cared for this. We will never make this again.

I am just learning to cook and have, until now, always over cooked pork chops so badly that it wasn't worth trying to choke down.. but THIS! In the end, it was DELICIOUS and my children were asking for seconds. We paired it with Saffron Rice, homemade mashed potatoes, and buttermilk buscuts. So simple and incredibly delicious.
