This recipe is tasty, but for the purists out there -- Cubans do not eat tortillas, sour cream, cheese, etc. Ropa vieja would be served over white rice, with a side of black beans and fried sweet plantains. =) That's what I recommend -- I'm Cuban! =)

And 5 more stars too! I made this with a 4 lb chuck roast, doubled all the ingredients and added a LOT more garlic (that's my personal preference, but 2 cloves sounded way too light for this much meat!)The only other change I made was to add 2 packets of Goya sazon and some capers near the end.  This recipe is as good as ANYTHING you'll get in a cuban restaurant(even in Miami).  Served it with moros y christianos (black beans & white rice) for a really traditional cuban meal.  A good squeeze of lime on top is all it needs. do try this..you won't be disappointed!

My husband is Cuban and he loved this dish!  As suggested by other reviewers, I increased the amount of garlic.  I did add some extra cumin and some salt towards the end to adjust the flavors.

I bought a crock pot specifically for this recipe.  I could not have been HAPPIER!!!  I made this ropa vieja for my boyfriend's 30th birthday and I got nothing but rave reviews for days to come!  The only changes I made was I added an entire head of garlic (chopped) and 1/2 a 7oz jar of diced red pimientos, in addition to all the other ingredients.  I also took out some of the liquid approx 1 hour prior to finishing (on the 4 hours HIGH mode), shredded the meat then, and added 2 tblspns of Brown Sugar, then stirred.  This really made the flavors come alive by the end of the 4 hours.  Probably one of the best recipes I've ever made!  Served over white rice, black beans, w/ salad.  THank you so much!!

This came out great. I served it with black beans, white rice, and maduros (sweet plantains). I did however only give it a 4 because I did make some adjustments to make it come out more flavorful. 
First, I made sure to season and marinade the beef the night before. I seasoned the meat with a badia complete season (used often in hispanic dishes) and some badia chimmichuri sauce. I then sprinkled it with garlic salt and rubbed some more minced garlic as well. I then wrapped the beef in saran wrap to sit over night. In the morning I tossed the remaining ingridients as listed and went to work. It came out wonderfully seasoned and not at all bland like other reviews said. I will definetly make this again. 
Thanks!

Hi! This is my recipe. When you send things in AR tweaks them.  I definately add more cumin and vinegar (apple cider) and don't add the cilantro till serving.  I also add a sazon packet and bay leaf.  Hope you love it as much as my family does!

I was happy to find this quick version of a recipe I got from a gourmet magazine and it was just as good!  As per the gourmet version, I added a lot more garlic (5 cloves but will probably use even more next time) and 1/4 cup of capers at the end, which added a nice salty/tangy flavor.  Next time I will try this with a can of drained tomatoes rather than the sauce because I think there was more than enough liquid with the beef stock. I think the nicest thing about this recipe is that it uses many fresh ingredients rather than canned or powdered soup, etc. that seems to be popular in crock-pot cooking. This might take a few more minutes to prepare than some other crock-pot recipes but it is definitely worth it!

Marvelous!  I used the pressure cooker to save time.  Added the beef to the pressure cooker with some water.  Also added a beef boullion cube (to make beef broth).  After pressure cooker stabalized I cooked it 20 minutes.  I used London Broil steak.   Turned off heat and let it sit 10 minutes in the PC.  Then took meat out shredded it with a fork.  Took out 1.5 cups of beef water to use as broth.  Next stir-fried the onions, peppers garlic 3 minutes.  Then added the other ingredients + a bay leaf.  Simmered it covered for 30 minutes.  Used apple cider vinegar, it still is delicous!  Served it with black beans and rice.

my grandmother is Cuban and makes Ropa Vieja. When I told her I made it ...she tried it and loved it. This recipe just might be as good as hers. Love it , love it, love it. Only suggestion is...if you want it a little saucier....add more tomato sauce if you are eating over rice, we like it that way. Cook on low 6 hours for tenderness, and use flank steak; skirt steak is ok, but doesn't shread as easily) Mmmmmm

This recipe is Cuban not Mexican so nix the sour cream, tortillas and taco shells.  I was born in Cuba and my recipe for "Ropa Vieja" is the one that she taught me.   I use brisket instaed of flank steak. I also use onion, green onions, and bell peper.  You also need "vino seco" which you can buy at most stores that carry ethnic products.   I use salt, comino, oregano, real garlic, and tomato sauce.  This is the real "ropa vieja recipe.

This recipe is to die for! I can create a meal that tastes just like I've been to an authentic Cuban restaurant. The only suggestions that I would make are: 1. you don't need to go out and buy fresh cilantro, that will only go to waste in your fridge - the recipe is just as good without it!, 2. If you don't like too much of a tomato flavor, I would suggest using less tomato sauce and more beef broth. Either way, the recipe is great!

We thought this was average in taste. I cooked this on high for 4 1/2 hours, after which it still wasn't as tender as I was hoping and was quite chewy. I agree that it could use some salt and I suggest using a boneless chuck roast rather than flank steak (cooking on low for 8 hrs), which I personally think would yield a much better result. It has potential!

I have used this recipe at least a doz times.  Fed to Cuban friends with much approval.  I learned that the cut of meat matters.  Tried the chuck roast but too greasy.  London Broil works the best.  I learned that it is faster and easier and produces the same results (possibly better) if you just toss everything into the crock pot and go.  So you can omit the olive oil.  If I don't have cilantro in the house, I just add extra cumin.  I always serve over white rice with black beans on the side.  Pure simple and delicious and authentic.  You don't need extra spice unless you are trying to turn this into a mexican dish.

Soooo yummy.  I've been on a search for recreating food from my childhood and I found the recipe for ropa vieja!  One unfortunate thing is that our local store doesn't have flank steak so I had to make due with stew meat.  It's a pretty good substitute taste wise though, just looks funny because it's short cuts and not long strips. I also substituted dry oregano for the cilantro to make it more true to what I used to eat.  Cilantro, tortillas, all that stuff is more mexican.  Last thing, after browning the meat, I removed it and added the stock to the pan and scraped up all the lil bits of beefy yumminess, then added it to the slow cooker for that extra flavor.  Love this recipe, its exactly what I was looking for and I get to stick it all in a slow cooker and let it do the work for me!

I found this recipe about a year and a half ago on All Recipes and have been making it ever since.  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect as is.  However, I have changed it up a few times for personal preferences this is what works for my family the best:  I normally use a decently sized roast and combine the cumin with some oregano, salt, pepper and paprika and use it as a rub on the meat, which smells fantastic when you sear each side.  After that I throw it in the slow cooker with the onion, garlic (normally around 4 cloves, love garlic!), handfull of choped up cilantro, one choped (deseeded) jalapeno, 1 29oz can crushed tomato, 1 29oz can tomato sauce, a dash of white vinegar and a dash of sugar.  Then, after it's done cooking, there is a nice sauce left over to scoop over the top.  My family asks me to make this recipe for them all the time, and it's just so easy (and GLUTEN FREE!).

This was very similar to the ropa vieja we order in our favorite restaurants. My husband really loved it, gives it five stars, but I only consider it a four-star dish. I found it a bit too tomatoey for my preference. If I make it again, which I probably will, I will leave out either the tomato sauce, or half of the tomato paste. The combo of both was too much. I also used much more garlic, six cloves, than the recipe called for and it could use even more than that. I'll add about eight cloves next time. I also left out most of the cumin because it's such an overpowering spice. I used 1/4 tsp.

GREAT!!!! It was the first time I've made something like this with flank steak.  usually we use brisket so it was great to try something different.   I used a mix of kosher salt, garlic powder, cayanne pepper and some onion flakes on the meat BEFORE browning on both sides.  I deglazed the pan with some tequila and beef broth.  I poured that over the meat in the crock pot and added tomato paste, cumin and a can of green chilies.   Toward the end of cooking on low, I added some sazon.   It was wonderful.    I plan on making this dish plently of times in the future and will probably try it with a large brisket when we need feed a large group of people.

everything is on target with the exception of 1 key ingredient which is the mystery ingredient behind ropa vieja and picadillo....1 packet of Goya sazon sin achotes.  You can find it in the Hispanic section of the grocery store.  It comes in a box. Cut down on the tomato sauce/paste a little and you have an authentic recipe.  Great recipe

OMG this was the best ropa vieja I have ever had! I live near a city where the majority of the people r from Cuba, so there r many Cubans restaurants; but nothing compares to this recipe-small changes: added 4 cloves of garlic and 1 teaspoon of paprika. Do not use flank steak the true ropa vieja is made of beef chuck roast and is served with white rice, black beans and fried sweet plantains! Cook on low for 10 hrs or high for 4 to 5 hrs.

I'm from Miami (19 years) and married to a Cuban. First, I must say that this recipe is KICK A**! So easy and full of SABOR (flavor). We are garlic lovers and used six garlic cloves and topped it off with a squeeze of fresh lime, delicious just like my mother-in-laws only this recipe is simple. I recommend that anyone who wishes to try this recipe follow it exactly as written.  Don't use chuck roast use the flank steak and stick to the authenticity of this recipe.

I used the high setting in the crock pot and the beef was slightly tough to shred, but once it was shredded it was pretty tender and flavorful.  I'd probably use the low setting next time and get my act together in the morning to cook it longer :)  It was a pretty good dish.

This recipe is super basic...I had to change this recipe considerably to make it taste good. I used sherry vinegar instead of white, used 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of cumin, a small green and red bell pepper for color/taste, 1 large shallot, 4 cloves of smashed garlic, 1/4 cup pitted and halved pimiento stuffed olives, 3 tablespoons of tomato paste (instead of a can), a can of crushed tomatoes with jalapeno instead of tomato sauce, ground fresh pepper, 2 bay leaves, and I added 1/2 cup of red wine. If this is going to be in your slow cooker for more than 4 hours then you need to increase the amount of liquid you use. I usually put in 1/4 cup for each hour! 

Also, you can serve with black beans which you cook with soffrito and plain white rice!

This needs a little kick. It smelled great while cooking, so I was expecting something fantastic. It tasted like tender meat in tomato sauce. I may make again but add a couple of fresh jalapeno peppers and more garlic to give it some extra flavor. It is missing something.

This was good, but I would have liked it with a little more spice.  I accidentally forgot to put in the cilantro...not sure how much that would have effected the flavor.  I added probably a teaspoon of cayanne pepper, but I would probably double that next time.  I think I had my slow cooker at too high of a temperature, though, because it was a little tough when I tried to shred it.  Overall, though, great recipe!

I added capers, pimentos, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I do recommend extra garlic cloves and a squeeze of lime. I serve it in flour tortillas with cilantro, cheddar, and sour cream! Really good!

Very, very easy and tasty. The prep time for this was even less than 15 minutes. You more or less throw everything into the crock pot and wait. Do not skip the broiling step which carmelizes the meat and creates a seal. This is essential.  The only things I did different were: (1) I did not use flank steak. I figured that it was going to be stewed down incredibly anyway so it didn't matter what the beef was. I used a thick cheaper meat and it was fine. (2) I cooked it for 5 1/2 hours on high. (3) served with fresh lime and cilantro on top and sour cream on the side. And (4) served with black beans and rice. Some of us wrapped everything in tortillas which was amazing as well. Went will with margaritas and mojitos.

Fantastico!!  I left out the green pepper, but added 1/2 seeded jalapeno.  I didn't sear the beef first, just threw it in the crockpot all day.  It was delish!  Served it with the "refried beans without the refry" found on this site.

This is the first time I have ever had ropa vieja & I live in Miami - obviously, I am not Cuban.  I couldn't say then how it compares to ropa vieja made by the natives but this was very tasy.  I did not give it 5 stars because it seemed like it needed something, but not sure what.  Maybe extra garlic like some reviewers here commented.  I can honestly say though that I followed the recipe exactly w/o making changes.  If I make it again, I might chop up some fresh onion to be used at the table once the dish is served up.  And maybe I'll try the extra garlic too, but overall it was very good & the meat was very tender.  I might also make this sauce next time I make a Mexican dish because I could imagine using it as an enchilada sauce (must be the cilantro).

Delicious recipe but the cilantro can be omitted as it's not traditional to Cuban cuisine- tho' it has gained popularity by tv and online chefs/cooks due to the popularity of Mexican food in this country. It may be someone's personal favorite but it's not traditional and can definitely be omitted from this recipe.

This was ok, even after doubling the garlic, cumin and cilantro.  I even subbed the tomato sauce for diced tomatoes with green chiles.  After 4 hours on high I was not able to shred the beef. It didn't remind me of my cuban restaurant affairs from Florida at all.

Good flavor. I used a chuck roast because flank steak in the crackpot doesn't seem right to me. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because it was all I had.  We enjoyed the leftovers as shredded beef tacos.

Excellent, this recipe is a keeper. The meat was tender.  I cooked 1 hr on low, another 3 on High and last hour on low.  The sauce/juice was think.  I served it with yellow rice, black beans and yellow sweet plantains fried in butter.  This recipe is a HIT!

Too chewy, and didn't care for the taste. Be sure to stir or the sauce will burn and leave a nasty taste.

My family was luke warm on this dish.  I did not use the right kind of beef (it had a slow cooking sticker) - so it did not shred for me.  It was also quite blad (I had to left out the green peppers).

Just okay.  My husband is Cuban, and we have had many versions of Ropa Vieja, and this was the least desirable.  We even put it on tortillas with cheese and sour cream to help it out a bit, but still not that great. If I'm going to cook something that takes this much time, I want it to be yummy!  This fell short.  I'd recommend trying a different recipe for this.

I have no idea how authentic this recipe is, however, it is simple and delicious.  I thought this was a little on the juicy side for a taco which is what my husband intended to do with it.  I know in Cuba that is not how it is eaten, but in my house anything that goes with guacamole is eaten on a tortilla.  This went very nicely with fresh advocado or guacamole.

Made this after work with my pressure cooker instead of the slow cooker. Used boneless beef ribs, no tomato sauce, 4 cloves of garlic and a jalepeno instead of the green pepper. Outstanding!! Served with black beans and rice. Totally worth making again!

This was good but I was left disappointed.  Living in Miami we get used to the very best.  I found there to be too much tomato and not enough salt.  Definitely needs to be marinated overnight for more flavor.  The search continues for the holy grail of ropa vieja recipes.

Disappointing. No flavor at all. Ate over brown rice and had to add hot sauce and worcestershire to make it reasonably palatable. Definitely will NOT make again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I tweaked it a bit by adding a red pepper in addition to the green pepper.  (Peppers should be cut into 1" squares rather than strips)  I also used four cloves of garlic and about 3/4 cup of sliced pimento-stuffed green olives.  I found it took approximately six hours to cook on high because I had used chuck roast cut into pieces because the store did not have flank steak.

This wasn't bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. I made it as written except I did add extra garlic as recommended by other reviewers. Once it was on the dinner table we found it bland and uninteresting, and added salt and pepper (not much help). The best thing about this dish was the awesome smell it filled the house with all day. Too bad it didn't live up to its smell!

I was hoping to like this recipe more than I did.  I think it needs a little something else.  Salt and pepper?  Hot pepper flakes?  I did use a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, and let the meat marinate in the sauce overnight.  It came out nice and tender, it was just missing something.  We'll try it again and see if we can kick it up a notch.  Also, I agree with the first reviewer - serve it over rice with beans - no cheese or sour cream here!

This was OK.  I added two packets of Goya sazon and all of the cumin the recipe calls for, but it still was pretty boring.  I will not bother making this again.

Basically I think this tastes pretty good, but I think it could be better. I appreciate how simple the recipe was to make, and therefore something a working family would really appreciate. I have to admit, I did not have the cilantro to add, and perhaps that may have made the difference, but I really doubt it. I added red pepper to the recipe and did use brisket rather than flank steak. I added a bay leaf as well. Perhaps my local Cuban restaurant has me spoiled? I will definitely try this again!

I usually shy away from reipes that call for flank steak as the meat tends to be too tough but I thought this turned out pretty good.  It definately needed some salt and some cilantro.  Served over rice but next time I think i'll make some homemade tortillas!

LOVE THIS RECIPE ITS MINE AND MY MANS FAVORITE AND IS EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY. IN MINE I USE 1 JAR OF SOFRITO SAUCE, FROM THE SPANISH ISLE, AND ALSO LEFT OUT THE CILANTRO AND CUMIN. THE SOFRITO SAUCE TAKES CARE OF ALL OF THE FLAVORS!

So good! I served to 70 people, and they all loved it! I used rump roast bc it was on sale. I served with black beans and white rice. I also left out the cilantro. My cuban grandmother would be so proud :)

I served this for guest and it was the best roast I have ever made but I thought for Ropa Vieja it was pretty bland. Next time I will spice it up a bit. I got lots of compliments even though everyone dumped salsa fresca all over it.

I actually won at my work "The Golden Whisk" for this recipe!! My only alteration is I only use 1/2 can tomato paste and about 4 cloves fresh garlic. I serve on a crispy tostada with refried beans and top with sour cream, cheese and tapatio. Deelish!

This was awesome...very authentic Cuban cuisine. I recommend cooking 3 hours on high and 4 more on low, the meat just comes apart. Excellent with rice and beans and a mojito. Thanks!!!

Tried on high fo 4 hours and beef wasn't even close to shredding.  Turned down to low for another four and that did the trick.  Very easy but didn't have quite enough flavor which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.  Will definitely make again and try to find a way to kick up the flavor.

I was a little worried trying this recipe because I started it in the morning and then ended up having impromptu dinner guests.  I usually don't like serving a new recipe to people until I have tried it once.  Luckily with this one though I was not disappointed.  It came out fantastic.  The meat was well flavored and tender.  The sauce was great and I served it over white rice with black beans.  It was a great meal. Thanks for sharing.

I have no earthly idea what happened, but I made this recipe as written, put my crock pot on low and left for work for the day. When I came home, the sauce had completely charred, the meat was a hard lump. The pot was indeed on low, and had cooked for about 9 hours. I have cooked many a roast in that pot for as long and longer.

Coming from a hispanic background, I am used to eating foods with lots of spices and flavors. I was a little reluctant towards this dish to start off- fortunately I gaved it a go and tried it with a little modefications here and there. I am thrilled that I did because it was delicious! The sauce came out tasting somewhat like Birria. Which was good. 
I also made Cuban rice and beans which complimented this dish very well.

I used usda flank steak and made some variation. I brown the meat on both sides to seal it. I put the browned meat into the pressure cooker and add 2 cups of  beef broth cooking during 10 minutes on high pressure. meanwhile I seasoned the rest of ingredients together and sautéed in olive oil then I added the shredded meat with a cup of red wine and cook for 10 minutes  until sauce is thick. Serve with white rice.

Great Cuban classic. Beef brisket works well also. Double the garlic and sub large onion for for small one recipe calls for. Need to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt as well. Serve with black beans and rice and garnish with cilantro, sliced red onions and pickled jalapenos.

Tastes more like beef stew than Ropa Vieja. The entire recipe needs to be reworked to be closer to the Ropa Vieja in my favorite Cuban Restaurant. 

To much tomato flaver. Next time I will substitute red wine for half the tomato paste. I doubled the garlic and yet you still barely taste it. I will add more next time. It does need salt, probably 1-2 tablespoons.

This recipe was tasty, but too much tomato for my family.  I grew up with Cubans, and there was never that much tomato in their recipe.  Next time I will cut the tomato sauce and paste by half, and add the cilantro at the end.

This tasted better than expected. It reminded me of a combination of pulled beef and enchilada sauce, but it wasn't really spicy either. And, it tasted good with just plain white rice, from my rice cooker. I asked on the recipe buzz for some sides and was told this dish is best with: rice, beans, and a salad, and "not" tortillas, cheese, and sour cream for a traditional meal. And, I agree. I subtituted parsley for the cilantro in the dish as my only change, as it was what I had on hand. I used 1 tsp. dry for the 1 Tblsp. fresh. And, 4 hours on high worked perfect as suggested. Some was eaten when I first made it. But, for some reason the leftovers tasted much better.

"Cuban" Ropa Vieja is never serve on tortillas, with lettuce, or cheese on the side. You can have a "salad" instead though! Stick to white rice, black beans and sweet plantains...  I'd change the white vinegar for red cooking wine.

This turned out very well and smelled wonderful while it was cooking! I did as some other reviewers suggested and increased the amount of tomato sauce (I like things saucy) and garlic. It's a simple dish with a lot of flavor, goes great with rice and black beans.

This was excellent.  I did add Sauzon, more garlic, and an extra cup of beef broth as suggested by others.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I served with black beans and rice and plantain chips.

This recipe was good but it was not Ropa Vieja, which is why I'm only giving it a three. I live in Tampa, FL where there are plenty of fantastic, authentic Cuban restaurants, and Ropa Vieja is one of my favorites. This was WAY too heavy on the tomato flavor and there was something else missing that I couldn't figure out. Having said that, I used the leftovers on toasted buns and melted some provolone. Those were fabulous.

Update 2014: I tried this recipe again. Used half the tomato paste, double the garlic and I added one packet of Goya Sazon. Tremendous difference!! Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family could not wait to try this.  The house smelled wonderful when we got home from church so we were anticipating a great meal.  The meat cooked up nice and tender after 4 hours on high and was perfect and ready to shred, however, this was the blandest dish I've had in a while.  We were very disappointed.  We tried spicing it up with more cumin and salt to serve it but ended up putting it on tortillas with sour cream, cheese and green onions.  I will not make this again.

It was very cold in MN today, so I cooked this in a 300 degree oven for 3 hrs. Then shredded and cooked another 1/2 hour.  Fabulous recipe. The shredded pieces were too long, so the next time I make this I will cut the steak in thirds before I shred it.

This was really good.  After the meat got nice and tender I removed it to a cutting board to slice/shred it up.  I poured the cooking sauce into a bowl and placed the meat back into the crock pot mixing in enough of the sauce just to get moistened.  I served the remaining sauce on the side for people to add as wanted.  I served with rice, black beans, and traditional burrito toppings on flour tortillas.  Great!

this was so delicious!  i made this two weeks ago and i'm still drooling thinking about it.    i tried to take as much advice as possible from other reviewers.  i used chuck roast instead of flank steak (use more than two pounds to allow for size reduction when fat cooks off), and the night before i rubbed it in a chimichurri paste i bought at world market, salted it all over, and wrapped in saran wrap overnight.  when i prepared it the next day, i used the ingredients as they were originally listed, but added a whole garlic instead of just a couple cloves, and eliminated the cilantro (only because i didn't have any).  just under an hour before serving, i added more cumin and a packet of sazon goya (you can find this in the hispanic food section of the grocery store).  when finished, i shredded and served on top of black beans and white rice.  this smells so great while it's cooking you will be dying of anticipation waiting for supper to start.  i can't wait to make this again!

This dish was great.  It came almost exactly like the restaurant version.  Instead of cilantro I used 2 tablespoons of fresh sofrito.  I also marinated the meat over night seasoned with some adobo, garlic powder, onion powder, and red wine vinegar.  My daughter who is every picky loved it and had it for lunch dinner again the next day!

My parents were born and raised in Cuba and never had any foods with cilantro in them on the island.  While this is an edible dish, and quite tasty, I wouldn't necessarily call it Cuban.

There really wasn't anything too spectacular about this dish. It was tasty and easy, but it didn't really wow me. I served mine in flour tortillas with slices of avocado, sour cream, and shredded cheddar. It was a good meal, and I'd probably make it again, but it really wasn't anything unusual or exciting. Maybe next time I'll play with the spices and see what I can come up with.

Very good recipe.  Added the tomato paste but not the tomato sauce and it still created a lot of sauce.  Left out the green pepper as I didn't have one.  Wife and kids loved it. Used top round steak as I didn't have flank steak and it shredded very nicely after simmering in slow cooker.  Served it on soft tortillas like a burrito with tomatoes, scallions, cheddar cheese and sour cream and was very yummy. I added some tabasco to my own serving to kick it up a bit. I think next time I will serve by itself with a rice and beans side dish.  This was a nice change of pace to the ordinary meals.

I just made this last night and it was really good. It was missing some salt so I added some on top and also added a little soy sauce when I read the other reviews that it wasn't salty enough. I added the soy sauce with all of the other ingredients when I put everything in the crock pot. I really liked it and so did my husband. I made black beans and brown rice to go with it. It was really good!

The only thing I can say about this recipe is WOW!! I threw it all in the crock, and 8 hours later I had the most delicious meal to serve my hard working husband.  Even my little picky eaters cleaned their plates!! There was nothing over powering or harsh about the seasonings, or flavors. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for such a great recipe!

really liked this. it was easy to make. I did drain mine at the end, cook down the juice to make a more concentrated flavor with 1/2 cup of white wine, as a reduction sauce. I added the bell pepper at the begining of cooking along with 8-10 serranos because we like a little heat. At the end of cooking when meat was shredded and while the sauce was cooking down, I sauted another large onion and several more bell peppers cut into strips until tender and then added this to the finished dish because we like more veggies with our meat (we grow produce!)

I read some of the reviews and changed the recipe a little bit.  I used a beef brisket (sale) added more garlic, Spanish dry cooking wine, sodium free beef broth, green & red peppers.  Every time we visit friends in Miami and go to our favorite restaurant my husband orders Ropa Vieja, which is his favorite meal. He said it was delicious!  It even tastes better the next day :) thank you for sharing your recipe and it was a HIT in our home :)

Love it. I used flank steak the first time but, chuck roast was better the second time (much more tender). I also add olives...

Haven't tried yet, but have a chuck roast in the freezer begging for this recipe. Just a note --- whenever I use a meat recipe such as this where no salt and pepper are listed among the ingredients, I always generously salt and pepper the meat before before cooking it or adding it to the slow cooker. The dish usually turns out just right.

Just the recipe I was looking for.  I was missing good cuban food when I moved to Colorado from Tampa. I used frozen pepper strips (yellow, red and green) added about 1/2 cup of green olives with their juice and a small jar of pimentos.  Fabulous flavor!  But please don't ruin it with sour cream and cheese!!!  Serve with yellow rice and seasoned black beans and toasted cuban bread if you can find it.  Also, the flavor really develops if you can resist and cook it longer not to mention it becomes much more tender.  Thanks for the taste of home!!!

As other reviews said, this recipe has potential. The sauce was good ( I did add more salt and cumin at the end) but the meat was tough and chewy.  Better to use a different cut of meat.

This was a little too "tomatoey" for me although the taste in and of itself is quite good. I might try it with pulled pork next time!

This was excellent with a few tweaks... I used a medium-large onion instead of small, added extra cilantro and garlic, and also added some black pepper, oregano and a small bay leaf.  Because my tomato sauce was unsalted, I also needed to add salt.  I used top round steaks, because they're what I had on hand.  After cooking on low all day, they were falling apart.  I think flank steak would have been equally good, if not a little better, because of the stringier texture. I served this with brown rice, black beans and fried plantains.  It's a keeper with the added spices, but seems a little bland as written.  We like things spicy, though!

This was so very good. Lots of flavor. We had it over plain white rice and had leftovers a few days later over baked potatoes.  Followed the recipe exactly.

Made this just as called for except because other reviewers had mentioned adding extra garlic (and we really like garlic) I did put in extra, and then used a sprinkle of garlic powder too. I used "Mystery Meat" that was frozen in our freezer...it may have been pork rather than beef and it had also been frozen in a marinade, which is why I couldn't tell for sure. But... obviously by my 5 star rating it was still really good! Everyone really liked it; kids included. I thought there was a ton of flavor! A few times we have been disappointed on allrecipes.com recipes because they have been seasoned enough, never because they were over seasoned. This one is NOT lacking in flavor or seasoning. Will definitely make again, and again.

This came out nicely. Next time I'll deglaze my searing pan with a small amount of beef broth and dump that into the slow cooker so I don't lose any of the tasty flavor. I'll also try to only use maybe 1/4 cup of beef broth and omit the tomato sauce, because mine came out saucier than I'd have liked. For a stew it came out perfect, but I like this dish best served on grilled garlic bread, as my favorite Cuban restaurant offers, and it was just too wet for that. The flank steak was fantastic in this, thanks for sharing your recipe!

The flavors of this dish are wonderful. But, if you aren't that keen on a tomato-based sauce, you might not care for it. But, the cumin and other seasonings are truly as good as at the Cuban restaurants. I served it with long grain rice, Cuban black beans and yeast rolls. I barely had enough of the beef for one serving of leftovers! It was that good and so easy to do in the Crock Pot.

Well, we already had some great tender beef so I somewhat adapted this recipe. I cooked the onion and green peppers with oil and garlic (at least double what it called for), then I added the beef stock, tomato paste, and used a can of enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce to give it more flavor and less of a tomatoey taste. Although I adapted the recipe, I still give it only 4 stars because I had to add quite a bit more seasoning to get it to taste delicious instead of just okay. It's a great base recipe! I served it more mexican style with corn tortillas and traditional toppings but it would be great with rice and beans as well!

I made this wonderful recipe and my husband and I loved it! I brought some to workand shared some with s co-worker and he loved it. The smell of just heating it up got the rest of the office going. They kept saying "Wow that smells good what is that"? I have directed several people to this recipe. It's easy to make and even better on cold days. I used a couple of cans of diced green peppers instead of the bell peppers which gave it a nice but subtle kick. I also used a can of whole cooked tomatoes drained which made more than enough liquid.

Wow, this was delicious and a crowd pleaser! I took the advice of another reviewer and added a packet of sazon goya. I followed the recipe, with the exception of using 2.5 pounds of flank. I will make this again!

fantastic!  I have made this again and again.  Some changes I've had to make: add more garlic for a deeper flavor and more tomato sauce when serving over white rice.  My meat never falls apart like supposed to, so an hour before done, I pull it out and shredd it myself, then put it back in the crockpot.  Yum Yum!

I made exactly as recipe states and served on tortillas with fresh cilantro.  My whole family enjoyed.  I would've given this 5 stars but the meat was a bit chewy,, not sure if there is a better meat for this recipe.  I will be making again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I thought it was good as a basic shredded beef recipe, but I would definitely recommend adding something to give it a little kick. I could see kids liking it cuz it's kinda bland, but my hubby and I agreed it could use a little heat. I will make it again, but next time I will add some tabasco or some chopped jalapenos. I'm not the kind of person who likes things really spicy, but just things to have lots of flavor. Green chiles might be good to add, too.

Delicious!  Had to make a few minor changes due to ingredients on hand (red peppers, balsamic vinegar), but this was great.  I"m sure it would have been excellent as written, but I also added some cumin toward the end of cooking time because the spices usually tend to lose flavor in the slow cooker.  This will definitely be added to our rotation.

I must have missed something as it didn't seem to have much flavor to it. The meat was well cooked but I don't know what was missing.

In the frozen mexican food section there is a cool whip size tub of recaitos that makes cooking this much easier. Recaitos is cilantro, lime, cumin and other authentic flavorings. I use it when making homemade salsa!

this was a good recipie as is but had to had a little more garlic and did NOT put cumin in. I have never made ropa vieja with cumin. To make it easier for all the reviewers, i suggest making a pernil the day before (pork sholder) in the oven and bake at 300 degrees all day. have that for dinner for one night. with the leftovers, that is what i take and cook on the stove. its already tender at this point and only takes me about 30 min to make. ive never used a slow cooker for anything. and as ive always said, left over are always the best!

I have this recipe too, and it is fabulous, and so easy, the meat from this recipe is so tender,  Only difference is I use a rump roast, that is cut into cubes.

This was very good.  I cooked it on high for about 5 hours.  It was quite stringy, but we put it in flour tortillas and my family liked it alot.  I also put some over rice and beans, which I thought was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great, and will go in the regular rotation.  Used chuck roast rather than flank steak, but other than that stuck with the recipe exactly.  Served it with plantains, white rice, and black beans.

My boyfriend loved this recipe. He refuses to order Ropa Vieja at a restaurant because he claims that I can make it better.  I read many reviews and I am going to try marinating the meat the night before with Adobo, olive oil, and cilantro. Add rice, beans, cilantro, and fried platanos, mix up some Mojitos and you are in Cuba.

I'm always looking for ways to use my crockpot, especially ways that involve using fresh ingredients instead of canned soups, etc.  I thought this recipe was so easy and really tasted great.  Really rich tasting.  I used boneless chuck roast instead and it turned out perfectly.

This was good and will probably be great the next time I make it.  I made some changes. I used a roast so that it was more tender.  I also rubbed it with salt and pepper before browning to add a little flavor.  I added a bit more cumin and garlic to the crock pot and left out cilantro b/c I just don't like it.  And like I said, it was good.  Very good.  But with MORE garlic, salt (the recipes calls for none?) and cumin I think this could be fantastic.

Fantastic recipe.  I'm Colombian and absolutely love to try any Latin recipes and this one totally nailed it.  I didn't change a thing but I couldn't find flank steak, so I followed another member's advice and used London Broil, it turned out tender, juicy and easy to shred after it was done.  I served it with Cilantro Rice (also from this site) and pinto beans.

This was absolutely delicious.  Next time I'll buy a better cut of beef, because the one I used was full of gristle and hard to shred.  But in spite of that it still turned out great!

Loved this recipe.  It was super easy to prepare and had good flavor.  The only thing I will change the next time I make it is to add some some jalapeno peppers to give it more of a bite.

I was so excited for this recipe.  I'm puerto rican and make mostly puerto rican food and i found this and thought i'd try something different.  it sounded amazing and the pictures people took of it looked so tasty.  I added 6 cloves of garlic because I'm big on garlic, and i added a little more cumin that it said to along with adobo and a packet of sazon.  an hour before it was supposed to be done, i tasted it and it was very bland and just tasted like tomato so i added more adoboe and stirred.  my husband came home and said how good the house smelled and we were excited.  we made rice and beans and shredded it and served.  i guess i don't like cumin?  i don't know.. it was bland and the only flavor you got was cumin and tomato. i gave it two stars because the meat was very tender but that's the only plus about it. i guess i'm not big on cuban food, i'm glad i tried something new though, thanks.

Very delicious! The only thing I did different was add more bell pepper because I love them. I've made this at least 4 times since I found the recipe.  One of my favorites and very easy to prepare.

We LOVED this recipe. It taste just as good as the ropa vieja we get at this cuban restaurant we love. I did make a few changes. I couldn't find flank steak at the store so used flap steak, the thin steak used for carne asade. I didn't brown the steak on the stove as the recipe states either. I seasoned my meat on both sides with salt, pepper, white pepper, and Sazon Goya. I also used the mexican style tomato sauce (El Patio). I let all the ingredients cook in the crockpot on low for 7 hours. I was suprised but the meat was done in a little over 7 hours. It could be because the meat is on the thin side plus I didn't have quite 2 pounds of meat. This was so delicious I'm making it again as I write this review! One last thing about the cilantro. I put this in at the very end and then let it simmer in the meat for 10 minutes before serving.

I thought this was really good.  It needed salt after it was cooked and I even added salt and pepper when I browned the meat.  I think it could use a bit more "depth of flavor," but overall I would say I'd totally make this again because it was so easy.  I served with rice and quesadillas on the side.  My husband made it into a "burrito."

I liked this. It reminded me fo the puerto rican dish "Pollo Fricassee" from this site. I added a splash of sherry. I served it over rice. It was even better for lunch the next day. I don't have a crockpot/slow cooker, so I use the stovetop on low and it works fine for me.

Very easy to prepare, economical, and tasty after adjusting the seasoning.  (Added homemade sofrito, some bay leaf, and increased the garlic).  We don't like bell peppers, so we used cubanelles instead.

I followed the recipe and found it to be bland, but my 4 year old liked it and my dad liked it after we added more salt.

We loved this recipe.  I followed the original post of the recipe; next time I will probably cut out some of the tomatoes.

Excellent recipe.  Use it as the filling for tacos soft shell and hard shell.  I make it all the time when we are tired of taco meat and want something special!  I leave out the tomato sauce and add juice of a lime, capers, tbls of chimichanga sauce and a sazon seasoning pkt!  yum

This was pretty good.  We used a chuck roast and put it in the crockpot all day.  We used alot more garlic than was called for and also quite a bit more cumin.  Since it was in the crockpot we cut down on some of the broth and we didn't use any tomato paste.  Next time I will probably stuff the roast with garlic to infuse the meat with more garlic flavor as it cooks.  Good recipe

WOW!!!  I made a few alterations to make this my own, but followed the same basic recipe, and this was EXCELLENT!  Just like the Ropa Vieja I have had at Cuban restaurants!  Served over rice (no tortillas) and I used a beef chuck roast instead of flank steak.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except no cilantro.  The flavor was bland.  Also, much too chewy.  I cooked it on high for five hours.  I think it would be better if I had done the 10 hour on low.

Fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for a tad more beef broth, because what was I going to do with a tad of beef broth?  I cooked on low in the crock pot for 12 hours, and the meat just fell apart. I will certainly make it again.

This was very good (soooo tender and juicy) but...I agree it did need some more seasoning. I added 4 oz. can diced green chiles, garlic powder, and some Adobo seasoning, and it still needed somethin' I can't put my finger on. I do recommend trying this, its worth it!!

This recipe is awesome! Ive made on several occassions for family and friends. Everyone loves it. I did add packet of Sazon and more garlic to the recipe like other member suggested. Add black beans and rice on the side along with sweet planatins and you have the best cuban dish. Thanks so much for sharing.

Excellent!! I used chuck roast instead of flank. Cooked on low for about 10 hours (overnight). Served over rice. Will be making this again for sure, next time I might spice it up a bit as well.

Nothing like the ropa vieja I've had at an island inspired restaurant. I was extremely disappointed. Despite the onions, peppers, and garlic, all we tasted was tomato sauce and meat. Mixed with white rice and black beans, it was edible.

This is absolutely delicious! It does have a very strong bell pepper taste, which I loved but my husband did not.  I think you could make this and it would turn out great with any cut of beef and I plan on trying this with chicken and pork.  We ate ours in tacos with pico de gallo and shredded cheddar cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Easy recipe for the slow cooker.  This is definitely an "even better the next day" dish.  I usually omit the cilantro because, well, I never have it on hand.  I also use either red wine vinegar or cider vinegar since they add a little extra flavor

Excellent!!  I made it just as the recipe indicates but with more garlic, cumin & cilantro.  The meat was very tender & easy to shred after 3 hours on high and a couple more on low.  I served it over white rice & black beans w/some more fresh cilantro on top.  Really delicious!!  We don't have any Cuban restaurants in Southern Ohio so it was a real treat.  Next time I'm going to try to find a recipe for fried plantains to go with it!!!

This was amazing!  Just like what you get in a good Cuban restaurant.  My husband absolutely loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and it cooked a good 10 hours in the crock pot on low.  Flank steak, btw, is also called London Broil.  We had black beans, rice and fried sweet plantains with this.  It's a keeper!

This was great! Everyone loved it, even the baby--he couldn't get enough of it! I used a pot roast cut (blade, I think) and it was great. I made pickled onions to go with it and served it on tortillas and took the leftovers for lunch for the next few days. Heated them up and slapped them in a sandwich and had my co-workers all drooling.

I omitted the green pepper (these don't hold up well to long periods in a slow cooker anyway) and added capers and cilantro at the end when I shredded the beef (about 1 hour before serving). The flavor was great and my husband really enjoyed it. I also served it over white rice with cuban style black beans. This recipe will definitely be made again in our home.

This was fabulous.  The meat was so tender and very flavorful.  I did not add green peppers (we do not like them) and it was still great.

I really expected this to be an okay dish.  Imagine my surprise when my very picky four year old daughter got in trouble for picking meat out of the bowl while I was trying to shred it.  I didn't pay attention to the size of tomato sauce needed, so I used a 14 oz can instead of 8.  I had way too much sauce left over too.  I would next time add more garlic, cumin and possibly some chili powder.  I used the meat to make enchiladas.  Instead of the canned sauce I purchased I used the left over meat sauce to make the enchiladas.  Also, I only cooked my meat on high for about 6 hours and it was done perfectly.  I suspect 10 hours would have been way too long.

Outstanding.  We ate it with tortillas but think it would be better over rice.  It was a little runny so it made a very messy, but delicous, meal.

I thought this one was just okay.  My husband tells me it's supposed to be mildly flavored, but it was just too mild for me.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exciting, either.

This is a wonderful winter dish!  I used canned tomatoes in place of the sauce and paste.  Also, company came unexpectedly, so I threw in about a pound of kielbasa sausage about 3 hours before we ate.  Turned out great.  What great flavors and it seems to be better the next day.

Delicious! Like others, I added salt and another half Tbsp of cumin. Kids and I loved it over white rice. Not quite as good as what I've had in Miami, but really good. Steak was really tough to shred, so I was worried it would be tough. I shredded it and let it simmer for another 20 minutes and it was really tender.

This is one of our go-to recipes. We used to live in south Florida, spoiled with delicious Cuban food abound, and this is a great alternative to it here in Colorado. We eat it solo with a side of black beans and yellow rice. It’s a crowd pleaser and the left-overs are fantastic (if you have any). My only qualm is that flank steak runs over $10/lb at my local Kroger!

This was decent as it, I made no changes. I think it has potential but lacks depth of flavor, which I was afraid of. Next time I will cut the tomato paste (much too tomatoey for us) and double the cumin and garlic. My Cuban husband drenched his in sliced jalapeños as well do it could have used some spice.

I read the reviews and tweaked the recipe according to the reviewer's recommendations.  For example, I used an entire head of garlic and a little less tomato paste.  I also added two packets of Sazon and salt and pepper.  I used flank steak but my Cuban boyfriend suggested skirt steak which I will try next.  We both enjoyed the outcome very much but I think I would add another green pepper and slice them a little thicker next time.  Very delicious!

Just a few changes for us and it was really good. I used a red bell pepper instead of a green one. Also agree that more garlic is better, I used 5 cloves and will use 6 next time. I also left out the cilantro, it tastes like soap to me (and about 10% of the population, so I hear). Followed the rest of the recipe as is. 

Cooked on low for about 8 hours, but then put it in the refrigerator overnight and re-heated for dinner the next evening. Out of the crock pot it did have a heavy tomato taste, but after allowing the batch to sit overnight the flavors blended well. 

White rice and black beans as a side, it was only missing the plantains.

I read one of these reviews where the poster combined this recipe with WHITE rice.  I grew up in Tampa - most authentic Cubans I know would find that combo a big faux pas - YELLOW or SAFFRON rice with this recipe!

Cuban Ropa Vieja Haiku: "Taste was pretty bland, too much tomato flavor. Ate with black beans rice." Easy enough to put together, and smelled incredible, but something about the end result was just a big yawn, possibly b/c there was neither salt nor pepper, and possibly because the tomato paste and sauce dominated. Served ours alongside Goya's black beans and rice recipe, and while that, coupled w/ the addition of cilantro and salsa made this better, it wasn't enjoyed enough by us to warrant making again.

I've made this several times and it always gets rave reviews from everyone. The only things I've changed is to sometimes use chuck instead of flank steak (only because it's cheaper), and usually omit the cilantro because my family doesn't love the taste of it. Amazing recipe!!!!

I've never had Cuban food before so I can't comment on authenticity or the proper way this dish should be served, but taste wise, this was fantastic!  We did use a chuck roast instead of flank for personal preference and served it as suggested by the author of this recipe on tortillas, with jack cheese, sour cream and cilantro.  It was a nice change from our usual tacos......even though I know this isn't supposed to be tacos.  I did also salt & pepper the beef as I browned it, to me, that's just a given.

I thought this was fantastic! My measurements were a little different (more beef broth and less tomato stuff) because that's what I had. I also used a chuck roast and added a can of green chilies as well as a packet of sazon, salt and pepper, a little more vinegar. I thought it was better the next day. With due respect to the Cubans, thank you for the flavorful meat, but we can be flexible enough to eat it with rice, in a tortilla, or inside a chewy French roll. YUMM!

I'm honestly not sure what ropa vieja should taste like, I was just looking for a way to use up some flank steak.  This was just okay.  Easy, but not overly impressive, a bit bland.

I added two sliced red peppers to this, and made a batch of sofrito sauce ( http://www.tasteofcuba.com/sofrito.html ) to this recipe.  The kids put theirs in large tortillas and ate it like fajitas, I had mine spread out on a bed of black beans and rice.  This is a delicious dish, that you can experiment with and make in several different ways.

I used leftover beef from my freezer (roast, leftover from another Allrecipes favorite of mine, "Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast", which I make often).  I used a whole head (17 cloves) of garlic, and about a 1/4 cup fresh cilantro.  ( I literally laughed out loud when the recipe called for 1 teaspoon cilantro.  I don't think so :) Unfortunately, the bell pepper didn't make it to my basket at the market, so I made the dish without it (which bummed me out).  I chose to serve this dish with steamed white rice, and a bean medley cooked in beef broth with earthy spices.  The beans and rice are a MUST with this dish.  I do not think this recipe rates 5 stars without the beans and rice on the side.  But, together, the dish is fantastic.

This has officially become my boyfriend's favorite dinner recipe. He asks me for it all the time. Thanks for the recipe. I actually use chicken and chicken broth instead of beef to mix it up a little.

This is a simple recipe with outstanding results.  I serve it with the traditional black beans and rice with a green salad.  I am not Cuban, but I lived in Miami for several years.

This recipe rocks! It's an easy and tasty way to cook for a family. The balance of cumin and vinegar is perfect. I used a "lesser cut" of top round London broil and it fell apart deliciously after 6 hours in the slow cooker. I'll try this the next time I'm entertaining a crowd.

I made this for my parents and brother. I have had Ropa Vieja at a restaurant as well as made by my sister in the past. My sisters' is probably the best (but she's an amazing cook!). This version was very good and so simple to make. Everyone liked it! I would definitely make it again. My brother doesn't like onions, so he pulled those out (maybe I'll cut them smaller next time). My 7-year-old niece (who is picky) enjoyed the meat (and the onions). 

I didn't have beef broth, so I made it from a cube. Also, we accidentally got FLAP meat instead of Flank steak - but the beef was as tender as could be. I also didn't have tomato paste, so used two cans of tomato sauce. None of these things made any difference I think. I only gave 4 stars, because as with others, I think it could have a little more flavor. Maybe next time I'll add some thyme.

delicious!  Next time I will increase the amount of broth and decrease the amount of tomato sauce.  Slighly too tomato-y for my taste.

Excellent!  Hubby loved it and will definitely be making again.  Only a few changes.  I don't like green pepper so I used red pepper instead.  Added more garlic.  Sans cilantro as hubby isn't a fan.  And a couple hours (cooked on low) before my roast was finished a added a little bit of brown sugar.  Served with black beans and rice.

My family is very picky. I served this with black beans and leftover jasmine rice. Consensus votes this is an okay dish. I would make again and use more garlic and cumin and possibly add hot pepper (is Poblano typically used in Cuban dishes?). I really liked this dish.

On second though in response to my review below I cooked brown rice and kept the left overs separately.  The meat on one plate, the sauce in a jar, and the rice in a bowl.  The next day I put them altogether and added a few shakes of sea salt and it is perfect! 

This recipie was good.  I did add tomato sauce with onion flavouring and a diced jalepeno and some sea salt.  I still felt it was lacking a little flavour.  I'd be interested to know how to bring out the flavours a little more.  I will make it again.  Next time I'lll just tweak it a litttle more.

This came out pretty good! I definitely disagree that this should be served on tortillas, or with sour cream and cheese. This is a Cuban dish, not a Mexican dish.

I made this last week for my husband and we both LOVED it!  It was so easy and we are still enjoying the left overs.  I took some of the juice from the crock pot to cook black beans with- add a little garlic and a bay leaf and you've got some killer black beans to go along with your yummy ropa vieja!

Great recipe.  Better when slow cooked for a couple more hours though, and minus the more Mexican-type ingredients (sour cream, tortillas....), however I did add in a little bit of Sazon Tropical seasoning, maybe half of a packet.  Delish...

This was really good! Just as good as most of the little Cuban restaurants around here (better then others), and I live in Miami. The recipe was simple, I had most ingredients on hand. The only thing I did differently was to use half a green and half a red bell pepper since that's what I had in the fridge. I served this with some black beans and rice and it was a great dinner. This made plenty so I already know what's for dinner tomorrow. :)

One of my favorite dishes to make. I love that I can put this in the slow cooker.   I don't use flank steak though. I use round roast. I read brisket is good too. Serve with spanish rice. Could also put a bay leaf in.  Wonderful recipe!

very good, i didnt follow all the measurements and it came out with a bit too much tomato sauce, but that was my fault. Hubby liked it though he said it could have used bit more spice..maybe next time i'll throw in a jalepeno pepper... ALso, i didnt have regular cumin, so i used roasted cumin and only 1/4 the amount becuase the roasted is much stronger

Just made this last weekend!  I was very impressed with myself!  It came out great and lasted a couple of nights which pleased me...makes like a little easier.  I seared the flank steak for only 2 minutes on each side because I was afraid it would over cook and I made the right decision.  I also added more garlic and next time I will double the cumin.  Other than that, it was delicious and I will definitely be making this again.  The first night I served it on hoagie rolls and the 2nd night over brown rice (that I boiled in the left of beef broth) and like most foods, it was even better the 2nd night!

I was a bit worried about the spices so I browned the meat, and made a rub for it.  I put the diced veggies and garlic in the bottom of the crock pot, and the seasoned meat right on top overnight.  Just added the liquid in the am.  The rub ingredients are (for 4 lb meat) 1 tbs chili powder, 1 tbs ancho chili powder, 1 tbs kosher salt, 1 tbs oregano, 1 tbs  cumin, ground black pepper to taste.  I also added a seeded diced jalepeno for more spice!  Turned out so delicious, and just enough spice for the whole family.  Happy cooking!

This was ok, I made it as stated with no changes.  My family found it bland, but liked the way the meat comes out very tender.  We had it over rice, which worked out well.  I will try it again with some added spices.

Absolutely delicious, and very easy.  I will be making this again, probably pretty soon.  I altered the recipe a little bit just to avoid going to the grocery store.  I seasoned the meat with adobo before searing it.  Also, didn't have tomato paste so used Goya Sofrito sauce, used a dried cilantro cube instead of fresh (this doesn't really need cilantro anyway, it's not in most ropa vieja dishes that I've had), and added extra garlic.  I am sooo happy to have found this recipe!

This was a big hit with everyone.  Very authentic.  I made it twice but it turned out better with chuck roast.  I had to drain some of the liquid with the beef steak but didn't with the chuck roast.  I also used the Sazon spice.  I served it with a side of cuban cilantro rice.  Excellent!!!

This was a great, easy recipe to make. Could have used a little more flavor beside the tomato, so next time I will double the seasonings and maybe add in a few extra, but turned out very well!

It's still cooking. I used a sirloin roast instead of flank steak (couldn't find any). So I knew it would take longer. It's been cooking on low for 10hrs so far, and was on high for 30mins (just to heat up the slow cooker). It was easy to shred, but it wasn't very juicy. And although the sauce smells fantastic, there's not a lot of flavor to it. Definitely needs some salt. I added more cumin, some garlic & onion powder. This helped some, but I think it still needs more salt.

There wasn't a ton of flavor, I think it needs more spice of some kind, but I don't know the true dish to know what it should be.

Amazing! I added black pepper while browning the meat, used more garlic and half pack of sazon (garlic and onion). It really brings the flavor out. Next time I'll use less tomato paste and sauce since it's high in sodium. You can still get a good amount of sauce. Do use flank steak, it fell apart after being on high for 4 hours.

I loved this, although felt it lacked something and had to add quite a bit of salt at the table. I used a chuck roast instead of the steak and also used five cloves of garlic instead of two like previous reviewers suggested. I wanted it to be a bit spicer so might try a jalepeno pepper next time. I served with rice and seasoned black beans and it was a wonderful meal!

I used brisket because that's what I had but it still came out great!  I used too much beef stock and had about 3 ls of meat so in the end i had to add 3 teaspoons of sea salt.  I served this with the balck beans, the Brazilian rice recipe and dinner was a bit hit with everyone!

I really wanted to like this recipe but it came out really bland.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I made was to add extra garlic.  I was hesitant about the flavor of this recipe because of the tomato base and I was right...it tasted like a cacciatore to me.  After 10 hours in the slow cooker, I had to throw in more spices to make it flavorful.  I wish I had some Sazon on hand because I think that would have helped out alot.  Overall it was a decent recipe but I dont know if I'd try it again.

Bell pepper makes it taste too italian, I would use a different type of pepper. Otherwise it was good. I just added an extra garlic clove and a little salt and red pepper.

YUM!  VERY quick and easy to make.  I love that this is a slow cooker recipe...perfect for a busy, working mom!  The beef is so tender after cooking in the slow cooker all day.  I did add extra garlic as others had recommended.

I will say that my husband likes this more than I do - but that's enough to give it 5 stars, if you've read any of my other reviews!  This is so easy, so flavorful.  We served with tortillas, and I think I might have made some rice as well.  The one recommendation is that I would keep the sauce you don't need - it was really good and my husband was horrified that I dumped it when I was done with it!

I thought that this meal was okay even though my husband and kids enjoyed it more.  I think it was mostly because I wasn't exactly sure how to serve them and the meat was "wetter" than I'm used to having it.  But, all in all, this is a very tasty dish which I will have to make again because my family went crazy for it.  I'm just going to have to get creative in how I serve it.

I'm making this as I type this and I can tell you already it's fabulous. I changed this recipe quite a bit based on what I had available but it's already outstanding! I omitted the cilantro and pepper and didn't use tomato sauce but instead used Goya Sofrito (that's what I had on hand). I also used way more garlic.. probably about 6 good sized cloves. I also added some jalopenos that I had leftover that I wanted to used up. I put it in the crockpot on high and after 4hrs I was ready to call this a disaster.. although the sauce tasted good, I thought it was far too saucy but more importantly the meat was tougher than ever, impossible to shred. BUT.. thanks to the other posters, I said let's just see what happens. Turned it down to low and now 3hrs later, meat is getting nice and tender and I'm able to shred it. I think I'll let it go another hour and then serve with black beans and rice. Thanks for an awesome recipe! We only have one Cuban restaurant in the area and they only serve Ropa Vieja on certain days, it's nice to know I can make a decent replica at home!

Ropa Vieja is one of my favorite foods.  This was the first time I have ever made it as we usualy go out to eat to get it.  It was good, but not as good as I thought it would be.  My husband liked it too, but I think I will keep looking for a recipe.

I had trouble finding the right cut of beef, so I bought what the butcher recommended. The meat was a little tough, but the flavor was great! I made this with black beans and saffron rice- Add a little dolop of sour cream and wala!

This was very tasty, but I have to say that no matter how much I cooked the Flank Steak (I simmered in my dutch oven for about 8 hours) the meat was still very chewy. Next time I'll either leave it in a marinade overnight or will select a softer cut of meat. The recipe is definitely worth trying and the beef shredded just like the Ropa Vieja I had in Miami

This is a great crockpot dish. It makes the house smell good.I definelty recommed a better cut of meat and slow cooking for tender meat. I only added more garlic and cilantro. This recipie is great for families with kids who may not eat something more spicy. We serve this with rice and black beans. Everyone eats it. Thats what makes a good recipe in my house....

I *love* Ropa Vieja ... and although I always swear that I'm going to order something different when I go to a Cuban restaurant - I never do.   This is really good.   The recipe would be wonderful as is - but I just amended it a little for my own tastes.   I don't remember having Ropa Vieja without green olives in it - so I did add them. I also used the olive juice in place of the white vinegar - since that's basically what it is, anyway. The other thing I did was to increase the onions.  I don't think that I "doubled" them, exactly - but probably close to it.   I'm adding this recipe to my files!

This was awesome!  I followed the advice of other reviews and used more garlic (5 cloves) and it was delicious!  I served it with arepas instead of tortillas, which provided a nice balance to the tomatoe flavor in this dish.  I cooked on low for 6 hours, shredded the meat, then coooked one more hour. Definitely will make again and again and again!

This recipe was very easy to follow. I added about three more cloves of garlic and some extra cumin. In the future I will add capers and green olives. The flavor was good, but I think I would follow another reviewer's suggestion next time and marinade the meat over night to add additional flavor. I cooked it for ten hours on low and the meat was tender. I served it with white rice and maduros. Quite a hearty and comforting meal:) Thank you!

This is a GREAT and very authentic tasting recipe!!  I was skeptical that it could be done, but was anxious to try and recreate my favorite cuban restaurant dish in my crock pot.  Amazing!!  It tasted EXACTLY like the dish I always order.  The only adjustments I made were 1) doubled the garlic; 2) omitted the cilantro; 3) substituted red wine vinegar for the white vinegar.  Served with rice and black beans and the whole family was thrilled!!

I thought this was very good served over white rice. I am still shocked at how tender the steak was; I ususally hate anything involving flank steak aka London Broil. I added hot sauce for spice and will probably throw in some chopped hot peppers next time. Delicious and ridiculously easy--I set the slow cooker to low before leaving for work and it was ready to shred when I got home! EDIT 10/13/2009: I made this again tonight and it was even better than the first time with a couple of additions: I threw in a can of sliced jalapenos and a can of Rotel chopped green chiles. Wow, what a kick! The heat may not be for everyone and I don't know how authentic it is with the addition of the peppers, but it was superb with the black beans, rice and some lime wedges. One MILLION stars! :-)

Thank you! Thank you! This is awesome!

I can't wait to make this recipe for my Dominican mother-in-law who pities her son for living with someone who can't cook anything like what he grew up with. He loved the dish and I know she will too.

I just changed a couple things. I rubbed the flank steak with garlic salt before browning, added extra chopped garlic, substituted a beef bouillon cube with vegetable broth instead of the beef broth, and added green olives. I served it with rice, beans, and roasted sweet potatoes. It was absolutely fantastic!

I used boneless chuck and slow cooked for 6 hours.  It was not easy to shred and it was sorta bland.  I was so looking foward to this and I was disappointed.

I thought it was just ok.  I tried a different cut of meat, so maybe that is why I didn't like it more.

This is a great recipe, but it definitely needs the two packets of sazon during the final hour.  Its best if you can make it the day before and let it cool in the fridge so the flavors combine.  I like to add extra onion.  I added extra pepper one time and it came out with too much of a pepper flavor, so keep it to the reocmmended amount.  Delicioso!

Great, simple, another crock pot recipe keeper! I omitted the peppers (they don't sit well with my husband or I anymore). I served it over brown rice......YUMMY! It would also be great on a bulky roll. My picky husband like it too. Too watery for a tortilla.

Loved this.  Had to change the cooking method since my slow cooker disappeared last time I moved.  So I just compromised, cooked it 5 1/2 hrs. on my stove's lowest setting.  A slow oven would probably work too.  Like most slow-cooked meats, it was better the next day.

Being half-Cuban and remembering how my grandmother and aunt used to make this when I was just a young'un, it was exciting to find that this recipe paid such an honest tribute to the dish.  It definitely improved upon itself overnight when I reheated it for dinner the next night.  But, my guests enjoyed the meal when it was first served and have already called to rave about it again.  

I had trouble finding flank steak at any of the 3 Wal*Mart's, though but lucked out at a Central Market the morning of the dinner.  So, I didn't have it on low for 10 hours, but it still turned out nicely.

I had just gotten back from South Florida where my Cuban friends had made my husband and me ropa vieja.  My husband was very skeptical about my go at it, but after he tasted it he was quite impressed.  This was amazing and it is now in our regular rotation!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my new favorite thing to make.  It is great for company since it cooks in a crock pot (I can have a clean kitchen!).  I serve with black beans and rice as well as flan.  It is also great topped with avacado.

The whole family enjoyed including my six year old picky eater! I used two chuck steaks instead of a roast because it's what I had on hand. Was a little nervous with the amount of meat at first but this worked out perfect for us. Added a little too much vinegar but balanced it with some sugar. Also added some sofrito and I will stress again to use a homemade recipe instead of the jarred stuff! Ate in tortillas spread with refied beans and toppings.

I found that even though this dish tasted exactly like the ropa vieja I can order at any local Cuban restaurant, it was not worth the effort.  Also, I had to add more vinegar than the recipe required.  With that being said, I think the dish lasted a day before all of my friends consumed it.

This is one for you to try, very rich in flavor. Depending on your taste buds after you shred the meat you can add a little salt.Taste great over white rice or with soft tacos.

I love the simplicity of this recipe which isn't short on taste or flavor.  I made it just as stated and set to low for about 8 or 9 hours.   The beef literally shredded itself and was so tender.  I served over rice with a side of black beans as a number of reviewers suggested.  Topped with some additional cilantro  Will definitely be researching a plantain recipe to serve with this the future.  Kids loved it too, which is always a plus.  This made a nice amount of leftovers for us.  By the third night, we used the remaining shredded beef for tacos for something different.  I will definitely be making this again…very soon.

This is my absolute favorite dish of all time. Whenever I visit my in laws in FL I always make a point to stop off at various Cuban restaurants to have it. I haven’t been to FL in a while and was craving this so I looked online to try my hand at this favorite. This recipe doesn’t disappoint better than others I’ve tried to be honest. As other reviewers noted I did add about five cloves of garlic. In addition for my own tastes, I added diced pimentos, Lindsay green olives, capers, roasted red peppers in addition to the fresh peppers and I used chicken stock instead of beef as it tends to have more flavor. I used chuck instead of flank steak because you get a really nice flavor from the fat content and it shreds just as beautifully, just make sure if you use this cut of meat you have your butcher cut it higher than wider so you get those nice long shreds of meat. As I’m in CA plantains are hard to come by so I just served with white rice and black beans and a wedge of lime for that nice hint of citrus to balance the salt.  I highly recommend this recipe. There’s another one out there by the gourmet foodie (I think that’s the website) and it’s good but a little too salty for my taste and it added carrots and celery which wasn’t bad but it isn’t as traditional

I have to agree with a lot of the reviews on here to substitute the white vinegar with apple cider. Another than is Cubans rarely use Cilantro nor do they put Ropa Vieja on anything other than rice. By substituting the white vinegar, nixing the cilantro all together, and adding green olives. It's was almost like how my abuelos used to make. It still isn't quite there though. Some of the other reviews recommend using Sazon, so I will try that next time.

Delicious!! My husband is Cuban and he approved! The only change I made was to marinate the meat overnight with seasonings, garlic, and lime juice.

Followed the recipe  but felt it was lacking salt after tasting it. I did shred the meat after cooking for 4 hrs and continued cooking a little longer which helped soften it, not so chewy.

I added a little more salt and garlic than was recommended.  Also, the flank steak I bought was closer to 2.5 lbs.  I was worried that 4 hrs on high wouldn't yield tender, easy to shred meat especially given the larger cut of meat I had.  My worries were for naught.  This came out wonderful, very tender, and shredded with little effort.  I agree with others that the additional fixings recommended in the original recipe (sour cream, cheese, etc.) are not traditionally Cuban.  Just serve with rice, black beans, yuca, fried sweet plaintains if you want to make it more authentic.

This Ropa Vieja dish turned out delicious. My husband and daughters loved it. The only thing I added was a bit of salt, other than that the recipe was easy to follow, not so many ingredients and the best part is that it cooks on its own!:)

I made this for Sunday dinner and everyone really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe closely; using red and yellow small peppers in place of the green pepper. I made Brazilian rice, southwestern beans and corn for sides with this. Left overs were wonderful as well!

This was delicious ! It is exactly like I remember this dish being served in many of the Cuban and Spanish restaurants in Ybor City the Latin "American" district of Tampa, in particular, the Columbia Restaurant. I'll make this one again. Excellent!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I cooked it on low for 10 hours, so it was tender. Very authentic tasting, but it needs salt.

I am Puerto Rican  and My husband is Cuban, so we like really flavorful food. I found that to make this recipe to our liking I needed to add dried crushed oregano, stuffed olives (with some of their juice), and bay leaves. Other than that, I love this recipe.  As side note, I substituted the onion, garlic, green pepper, and cilantro for some "homemade Puerto Rican Sofrito" since its something I always keep in my refrigerator and it includes all those ingredients already.

Delicious. My picky kids loved it. Great with rice and black beans. I softened the veggies in the pan after searing the meat and deglazed everything with the liquids before putting everything in the slow cooker. Easy, delicious meal.

As written this was pretty bland and very dry. After shredding and tasting the beef I ended up adding another half can of tomato sauce, the rest of the can of tomato paste, a little more beef bouillon, some olive oil (maybe my cut of beef was less fatty than others, but it needed a little more) more cumin, more garlic, paprika, a little oregano, salt, black pepper, and some Penzey's Pico and Salsa seasoning.  My family RAVED after the changes.

This had WAY too much tomato sauce. It was almost a flank steak chili stew.  It took a lot of tweaking to make it anything like a Cuban restaurant would serve.

Made it with one modification, I added onions and peppers with the meat while browing it since that’s how I prefer it when crock potting. Other than that, no big changes. Added more cilantro tho cuz I love that stuff. It was easy. Made the house smell like heaven. Served with rice and black beans. Yum!

Having grown up in Miami, this isn't the ropa vieja I remember.  It's seriously lacking in spices and definitely needs olives and a red bell pepper. I added Adobo seasoning (con pimienta), cumin, coriander, oregano, and more garlic

Delicious!  I have a 9yo who typically doesn't like meat, and she loved this, as did I.  Definitely will make again.

This is a five plus! I used all the ingredients listed but after reading other reviews, I cranked up the volume by adding more: garlic-7/8 cloves; cumin 1 1/2 tbs; fresh cilantro- 1hefty handful; vinegar- 2tbs; used closer to 3lbs of skirt steak [which I discovered is also known as flank or London broil steak]; added 1 seeded jalapeño pepper; and finally a couple squeezes of fresh lime juice... Sounds like a lot but gave this dish a deeply rich and flavourful taste that you don't often get from slow cooker recipes, no matter how long you cook them.  I had the time, so left the slow cooker on high for 5 hrs and turned down to low for two hrs. The aroma was amazing. Oh, and as per the recipe, you don't need to add salt!

I've made this dish no less than 10x and it always turns out marvelous. I've used several different cuts of meat depending on what's available without a problem. I serve it with a pot of steamed white rice and it disappears in no time flat.

This smelled incredible while cooking, however it was a bit bland for us even after following suggestions of other reviewers. I added extra garlic & seasoned the flank steak before searing. I forgot the tomato paste, but I think the amount called for would have made it too tomato saucy tasting for us. We didn't add sauce to a side dish, but I may use some sort of flavored diced tomatoes if I make again & want the sauce for a side dish. I also deglazed the frying pan with red wine & added about 1/2 cup sliced green olives  with pimentos. Maybe some of the recommended spices that I couldn't find in my rural community would have made it more flavorful? Will have to order those online.  We're going to put a Mexican spin on the leftovers & make burritos.

Delish - Didn't change a thing (but to the recipe submitter's credit) did add a bit more cumin and vinegar.  Topped all with fresh cilantro when serving with rice or quinoa.  Served with sautéed black beans, corn and orange pepper.  LOVED this meal.  Thank you so much!

Very good.  I had some limes around so I added fresh lime juice.  Instead of green bell pepper  I used Anaheim peppers, as my dad won't eat bell peppers.  He loved it as well.

WONDERFUL!  Husband said it's one of his favorite dinners!  Added about 5 cloves garlic , a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and used apple cider vinegar and a bay leaf like the author recommended.  Love it, thanks for the recipe!

It was very bland, I followed the recipe exactly but luckily I tasted it before serving. I added a generous amount of salt and pepper, a tablespoon of Cumin, a tablespoon of chili pepper, a generous amount of garlic powder and a handful of cilantro. Serve small with rice and tortillas.

I followed this recipe exactly and my husband literally took one bite and almost choked on a chunk of meat in his throat.  This was my first time using flank steak in a slow cooker and we don't think this is a good meat for that.  It is very chewy.  My kids ate it, but did not think it was that good.  I was so hoping it would have been a staple in our house.  Maybe with another type of meat it would work better and I would add more spice to give it more flavor.

Good base recipe.  I added about 6 tomatillos, red pepper flakes and lots more garlic.  Turned out great.  I recommend shredding it then letting it cook another 30 minutes or so in the sauce so it can absorb into the meat

This was pretty good!  I did use pork loin instead of the steak.  I also doubled the garlic and onion and pressure cooked this for around an hour.  It came out nice and juicy.  We served it with tortillas and over black beans and rice, topped with salsa and sour cream.  My husband preferred the tortillas and I preferred it over the beans and rice.  Next time I may squeeze lime and more fresh cilantro over top when serving to kick it up a notch for us.  Thank you for the recipe!

I did add some more garlic and also Badia all purpose seasoning.  I rub the flank steak with the all purpose seasoning and let it sit over night. I browned it like it says and then added to slow cooker. Even after that it was still lacking a little flavor. It's still a good dish and definitely recommend it. I will be making it again and try something a little different to see if I can get that authentic taste. Also I served with rice and black beans. Not sure who suggested tortilla and rice but Cubans don't eat tortilla with Ropa  veja.

Very very tasty dish. Kids (6 and 1.5) both loved it and asked for seconds. Cooked it in the oven at 300F for 4 hours instead of using the crock pot and it shredded beautifully.

This is so tasty and very easy to make.  I used chuck steak (hopefully the purists will forgive me).  It was so delicious with a thick tomato sauce.    Excellent idea about the beans and rice.

To eat it Cuban style: no cilantro, sour cream, cheese or tortillas (all of that describes Mexican food). Add more garlic and peppers as you see fit. Serve on rice.

I think that it definitely needs more seasoning.  I cooked it on high for six hours and the meat was still a little chewy.  Not sure what other meat would be a great substitute for this recipe. I do however know that using a pressure cooker makes a whole lot of a difference

Great dish! I needed to make something for a group coming over for a football game. It was a hit!  I did add chili powder to it and I deleted the cilantro (I don't care for it) I am definitely making it again.

The main reason  I wanted a slow cooker was to make this dish. It tasted like the one I get at the Cuban restaurant by my job, which means it was delicious.  I added a few ingredients in addition to the ones listed based on my personal preference and reading  many of the reviews; specifically I added 2 packets of sazón Goya, I used chicken broth instead of beef, I used garlic salt instead of plain salt, I only used half of the can of the tomato paste, I used about 8-10 garlic cloves instead of 2 and I added some Goya adobo, oregano,  and dark brown sugar.. The end result was awesome deliciousness.

made this recipe twice. My kids love it. I think it's pretty good but needed salt. My son's friend who is Cuban said it was pretty good. He also said it needed salt.  I used a pre packaged sofrita to add to the sauce. I have a batch in the slow cooker now, I will follow the suggestions and add some capers for salt.

Not extraordinaire but not bad either.....I think it is lacking a bit of flavor; however the texture is spot on.

I'm from Key West, FL and this is the closest thing to the real thing.  Amazing!  Must have black beans and rice, and if you are ambitious, fried plantanos!

This is not an authentic Cuban recipe but a close and tasty version. I will not give out my grandmas recipe out of respect but will state that anyone who changes the flank steak to another cut should not be stating they are cooking Cuban Ropa Vieja which means Old Clothes ( just like old clothes shreds so does the flank steak when it is cooked perfectly in this recipe). Most traditional ethnic meals are based on certain ingredients that make it that ethnicity. Changes from the required ingredients such as a particular meat or creams or cheeses just create new recipes.

This was a great recipe. I served it over white rice.  Next time I would double the green pepper and onions.

Cuban born cook here. This was far easier than the old way my grandmother used to do it! I left off the peppers, as mom is allergic, but this worked out really well. Oh yeah, I totally added a ton more garlic, because that's what we do.

The whole family loves this recipe, it's one of those perfect Slow Cooker Recipes that you can throw together in the morning and let go all day.
We always make it with a side of black beans and rice.
I found King's Hawaiian Jalapeno rolls to go along with it tonight (Cinco de Mayo).

The recipe is a good start, but could use some alterations to bump up the flavors.  I realize this may compromise the adherence to true ropa  vieja, but food is food, and I want it to taste good.  In any event, I subbed out for green peppers for three green jalapenos.  I did a basic chop, removed any large cores and let it soak in the slow cooker, seeds and all.  It definitely added a kick that blended well with white rice and black beans.

This was very good.  I made some changes that were recommended in other reviews.   I rubbed cumin, oregano,  coarse salt, black pepper, and paprika into the chuck roast (instead of flank steak) before searing (3 min per side).  The other changes I made was adding twice the amount of cumin, no cilantro, and apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Served this over white rice with black beans and fried plantains on the side.

Delicious! Although mine was not as tender, maybe I should have left it longer in the slow cooker, but it still was without a doubt one of the best things I've cooked. Amazing.

I really liked this recipe. I followed it exactly and it came out great. I made it at work for 240 people in a big tilt skillet (braiser). I browned the beef, added everything else and kept it boiling gently for 4 hours. It was fork tender and shredded easily. The sauce was thick and rich with a nice depth of flavor. We served it over rice and it was a huge hit. I will definitely be making this again.

I had my first taste of this at a Caribbean grill nearby. This turned out really well. I used a red pepper instead of a green one, included a jalapeno pepper, and used London Broil instead of flank steak. Added the peppers about 1 1/2 hours before finished. It cooked on low for 8 hours. I did add some salt once served. Turned out great served on a toasted ciabatta roll.

I worked at a cuban restaurant called palomillas in GA and have wanted to make this recipe for a while. I have to say this was very close. I added a few things such as ground ref pepper and dried cilantro. I think the red pepper was key. I hope everyone's family enjoys this as much as mine did!

So I made this in the slow cooker with the following mods: 5 teaspoons of garlic purée, one large onion, one tablespoon of cumin, apple cider vinegar instead of white, and cooked it slow for 10 hours. After the cook time moved it to warm, then forked the meat apart so that it was all separated in beautiful long strands. I then added a pinch of salt and pepper as well as a squeeze of half a lime before serving. BOOM! No leftovers at all. Cheap and easy but most importantly delicious.

This was fantastic! I used a beef roast as flank steak was expensive but other than that I followed the recipe. Very tasty. Will be making again. We had street tacos using the left over meat the next night. Those were great too!

So good.   I Used all organic products except for the flank steak.   It smelled amazing but lacked flavor.  since I doubled the recipie,  I added the following spices: two packets of Goya sazon,  a total of three heaping tsp of cumin, 10 small cloves of garlic, one tablespoon of sugar, half a packet of fresh cilantro, and 2 tsp sea salt.  Perfecto.

This is very good recipe it comes close to my mothers. Born and raised as a Cuban I was used to eating this all the time this recipe comes very close to my mothers cooking. I did change a couple things but other than that it's very good. I served it with black beans white rice and maduros any salad of avocados. Enjoy!!

I have made this numerous times, although I substitute the flank steak with a pork roast. I can't speak for how authentic it is (as I have never tried Cuban food), but I've never had to throw any of it out, and the leftovers don't last too long.

So good! I didn't include cilantro or tomato paste. Added in a lot of garlic, more cumin and oregano, salt, pepper, and cayenne, 1 packet of Sazon, and 2 tsbp of Sofrito. Great recipe. Cooked on low for 10 hours and served over rice. Delicious!

I usually use this recipe but change a few things. I add white cooking wine about 1/4 cup to the meat as it browns on the skillet. Also, I add 2 bags of achiote, and a little ketchup and mustard. You can skip this part if you wish, I find that it gives it more flavor.

I definitely used more garlic, more cumin, more cilantro, I even added black beans to to once and it was great. This a great recipe but I find that you need at least 6/7 hrs for the beef to get tender. Plus, if you want some heat, add a jalapeño for that extra kick!

My first review, I had to review  because this is so delicious I'll make it for friends in the future.  Made exactly as written except, I used fresh basil (no cilantro on hand & my basil needed trimming).  I also mixed all the ingredients in a big bowl before pouring over meat in crockpot.

I made this recipe months ago so it's long due for a review. I honestly wish I can make this everyday, unfortunately the meat used it more on the pricey side :( but the final product is so yummy, and worth it

I first added this recipe to my box 5 years ago.  I've made it countless times since.  This is incredibly tasty and as close to authentic as I've experienced (based on my limited experiences with Cuban restaurants).  One of my favorite all time recipes, and I usually serve it with Cuban style black beans and rice.

This was good and quick to get started.  I did add more garlic and a little chipotle chili and I deglazed the pan with the broth and mixed all the ingredients in the pan before adding to the crockpot.

This wasn't bad but it is missing something. It's flavorful (juicy etc) but not seasoned too well. I will keep the recipe and play around with the spices some. I had to add garlic (like many suggested) and a TON of salt. I followed the recipe as it was written but added a little minced onion rather than regular onion.

This recipe is not very authentic but I figured that I would give it a shot anyway.  Big mistake - ropa vieja is a savory dish and the can of tomato made it slightly sweet.  I also agree with the reviewer that said this wouldn't ever be served with tortillas or sour cream - Cubans eat bread.  I wanted to like this but overall it fell flat

This was super easy to make. You really need a fatty cut of beef or it will be kind of chewy. I would recommend giving this recipe a try. I'm gonna try to add some heat to it next time!

Really good flavor and liquid to meat ratio with the following adjustments: Salt/pepper the meat before searing, add a pinch of oregano, use more cumin, and omit the 8 oz. tomato sauce. I cooked on low for 7 hrs, but the meat still came out kind of chewy, and definitely stringy. Might try a different cut next time, since flank steak is not known for its tenderness.

I used a chuck roast because it was 1/2 the price of flank steak, used a sweet red pepper along with the green pepper. What a fantastic recipe!

I didn't find this authentic tasting at all. A bit disappointed. I LOVE Cuban food, have eaten a lot of it but this just didn't do anything for me. I don't think I'd make it again.

Was easy to make and came out yummy. I should have cut the steak in shorter pieces so it's not so stringy. I had it with tortilla wraps, nom nom. Thank you!

I tried this today .. I used more garlic and cumin just like the reviewers said.
it tasted good .. just not great.. but it's good for a change. 
I would do it again .. but I think next time I will add a little bit of olive oil on top of it before serving.

After I read the comments about "tastelessness", I seasoned the meat before browning with salt and pepper.  And second, when I re-read the recipe, I thought maybe the author forgot to write in Oregano.  I added 2 tsp.  Worked well.

I actually made this recipe for my Cuban mother-in-law.  I have to admit, it tastes exactly like hers.  The only change I made was to add a sliced red bell pepper.  I used the low setting on my cooker.  Cooked for 6 hours, then shredded, then returned to slow cooker for another hour.

This is a really good recipe.  I used a chuck cross rib roast and I followed the advice of others to add capers to the dish and it elevated the flavors.  I also added some lime juice, brown sugar, and a packet of Goya sazon.  I was afraid that it was a little too soupy, but the beef just soaked it up after sitting awhile.  My friend thought I added cornstarch or a thickening agent and was amazed to learn that I didn't use any.  This is great over rice.  This is definitely a recipe I will be using again.

Super easy and tastes fantastic ! Left it in the slow cooker all day and the meat was like butter! So tender and moist , I added a half table spoon of sugar and a packet of Sazon towards the ends and that just brought out all the flavors!

I cooked this last night in my crock pot and it was delicious! I always wanted to make ropa vieja. I tweaked the receipe a little. 1. I punctured the flank steak with a fork on both sides, then I rubbed in mccormick grill mates steak seasoning, garlic powder and Adobo Light before i seared it. 2. After I transfered the steak to the crock pot and used the left over oil in the pan to brown the onions. 3. Instead of beef broth, I used 1-Knorr Tomato Chicken Boullion disolved in one cup of hot water (brings out the beef flavor in the steak) and pour it on top of the browned onions and mixed the tomato paste and sauce then 4. pour the stock and the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot. 5.I used yellow/orange/red sweet little sweet peppers as well instead of the green pepper. It was a SUCCESS!!! coming from a puertorican ;-)

This had very little flavor.  I had to add a significant amount of cumin, garlic and salt to give this any kind of flavor.  I didn't get the cuban flavors I hoped for.  Definitely not worth it, considering the price of beef.

Missing flavor: salt, spice. This recipe smelled great, it looked great, but when my guests and I dug in, we all sort of looked at each other. They were very polite, but we all agreed there was very little flavor. I'm sure I didn't make any mistakes. Compared to cuban restaurants, this recipe is missing salt and a minor amount of spiciness. I'm not giving it 1 star, but having to pass a salt shaker around your table is embarrassing. And no, we're not salt fiends.

Very tasty!  Didn't have tomato paste, so subbed a 27 oz can tomato sauce & allowed it to slow simmer for 45 minutes.  Added 2 bay leaves, subbed 1 tsp key lime juice for the vinegar, omitted cilantro (hubs hates it) & added extra cumin to taste.  Kids & hubs all really enjoyed it, not realizing it was a reasonably healthy dish :-). Served with Cuban black beans, Jasmine Rice & a tossed salad...very enjoyable meal!!!

I tried this recipe on Sunday and i loved it.  It was very easy to make.  I think the hardest part about it was finding the flank steak because most grocery stores do not carry it.  To my surprise my local publix had it in stock..   I cooked it on my stove top because i really don't like my slow cooker, it took about 3 hrs on top of the stove.  I followed one of the suggestion above about seasoning the meat.  I seasoned it with the regular seasons i use and then seared it in the pot.  I added the rest of the ingredients with the addition of 1 cup of water.  I also used half of the can of tomato paste.  i put sugar in to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  It turned out great.  My boyfriend loved..  i would make it again and again.

Very easy to make! My boyfriend and I went to a Cuban Restaurant a few weeks back and I've been craving this ever since. Found this recipe and made last Monday. Its very easy to assemble, I work a full-time 8-5 job and Zumba after so it get a little tough for me to make us dinner the nights I have Zumba. When I made I use a London Broil and the rest of the ingredients exactly. It turned out wonderfully, and I was able to have a GOOD meal before my class. My boyfriend loved it and wants me to make it again, and that I can do!

This recipe was excellent!  So tasty and so easy.  I follwed the suggestion to season with Sazon prior to cooking, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The meat was tender and easy to shred, and served with rice and black beans it was a big hit with my family.

So easy to make & smelled great while cooking!  Delicious as written, though I thought it was even better with a squeeze of lime and sprinkle of kosher salt when I served it.  I served with cilantro lime rice and cuban black beans.

I followed the recipe exactly and the meat was nice and tender but the flavor was not there.  It had a very heavy tomato taste.  Between the tomato paste and tomato sauce, I understand why.  I have had ropa Vienna many times and this did not hit the mark.  I am going to research and see if there are Spanish spices missing

Love this!  I let this cook as slow and long as possible to get the most tender meat.  I use a roast instead of flank steak because at my small town store the flank steak (if they ever have it in) costs over twice as much.  I add a couple more cloves of garlic because I like it.  We serve with small flour tortillas, cilantro/lime rice and black beans with salsa and queso fresco.  I'm getting ready to make this again right now!

Have made it 3x already, the first time was to bring to a party so I decided that the easiest way to served it was on tostadas,(fried/baked corn tortillas) what a success!! I came back with a clean plate. So the next 2x I kept the tostadas as a most do. I added, as some suggested here, more garlic, 2 baggies of Goya seasoning, 3 bay leaves, capers, oh and salt.
Leftovers? I had leftos the last time and decided to make sliders, just added bbq sauce and nobody noticed it was the same meat as the night before!! money saver!
Thanks for the recipe!!

I started this recipe at 11 am and cooked it in the crock pot on low until 8pm. I seared the flank steak in oil and after I removed it and placed it in the crock pot, I added the beef broth to the pan to scrape up all the bits and then added that to the crock pot.  I mistakenly put too much vinegar but added some brown sugar towards the end to balance it and it came out delicious. I also more than doubled the garlic and added red wine and spanish olives. I'm sure it will be even better next time when I use the right amount of vinegar!

I make this all the time, and I love it. I think it is great the way it is listed, but I've made variations here and there. Usually, I will just add extra peppers or sometimes I'll use sofrito. I made this once for my father, who is from Cuba, and he loved it! Served over white rice with a side of black beans, sliced spanish olives and with plantain chips, SO GOOD! 

Oh and the leftovers make for an amazing filling for a sandwich. ;)

This is fine for a guideline, but my old and trusty cookbook that has this recipe in the original Spanish does it better.

Nix the cilantro and vinegar and the slow cooker.  Get yourself some dry white wine, alcaparrado (chopped olives, pimentos and capers)a bay leaf and a pressure cooker.

Great recipe. I made a few changes though; I used pork tenderloin because thats what I had on hand. It shreds up so nicely. I pretty much omitted the tomato paste and sauce, I used about 2 tablespoons at most. I also didn't add cilantro, because I ddin't have any.
 I don't brown the meat, I just toss everything into the crockpot and let it go. And I also add about 2-3 teaspoons of cumin. 
But all in all, this recipe has great bones - I serve it with white rice, black beans, and plantain, and now this is a regular in my house.

I made this with pork, couldn't find the steak and the pork was on sale, so I though, what the heck! I let it slow cook all night and oh my goodness can't wait for dinner! This is so delicious! The picture on my monitor looks brown, but mine is really red from the tomato sauce I guess.

I followed the recipe, but when it was cooked, it still didn't have that strong vinegar taste, like the Cuban ropa vieja does.  So I ended up adding 4 tablespoons of vinegar, instead of just one.  Other than that it was awesome!

It was a big success and a huge hit. I used the flank steak and didn't find it to have the same issues other commenters have stated. I'll definitely make this again.

Tasted great and the flank steak came out super tender! I may reduce the liquid a little next time, but no big deal.

This was great. My wife and kids ate this up with some yellow rice and black beans. 
This is one of my favorite dishes to eat in downtown Tampa. Usually the Carribean places make it a little less tomato based, so next time I will leave out the paste and add a bay leaf.

I followed the recipe to a degree.  I did not have fresh cilantro or cumin, so I used parsley and chili powder and I added some sugar and salt.  I cooked it the amount of time indicated 4 hrs on high.  The taste was good, but like another reviewer the meat was a little chewy.  I will try it again but make with the other suggested meats.  I served it with yellow rice and black beans and a nice green salad.

I know, I should follow a recipe exactly before reviewing it. Unfortunately, I've never strictly followed a recipe in my life! This was definitely a five star recipe when done my way: I used a 2 lb chuck roast because I had several in the freezer, homemade duck stock instead of beef because it was in my fridge, and two green peppers and one red, plus the onion. I added some extra garlic and a single habanero as well, because we like spice. I added the cilantro at the end, as I find it loses its flavor during cooking. I served it with black beans and rice, corn tortillas, and another sprinkle of cilantro. I took the beef out about two hours before we ate, removed the bone and obvious fat, shredded it, and returned it to the pot. I had actually started with only the one bell pepper as recommended, but it didn't look like enough so I sliced and sauteed two more and threw them in. This served my husband and I for dinner and made three to go plates for lunches. Great idea, thanks!

This was very tasty! I didn't have any issues with the tomato sauce being too thin as others stated. IMO you need the extra sauce as you tradtionally serve it over white rice. Next time, I plan on adding some green olives and bay leaf. This recipe was very generous and I imagine leftovers would freeze nicely. If you drain some of the extra sauce, it also makes awesome sandwiches!

I was only somewhat pleased with the taste of the sauce... it definitely could have used some more flavor. Also... I think more veggies or less meat would have made it better as well.  The meat chewy and lacked flavor as well.

Next time around I'll use London Broil or a Brisket and stab the meat and insert slices of fresh garlic directly into the meat, cover with sea-salt and brush it off before frying. I also think I'll fry it a little shorter and slow cook it on for 4 hours instead of 8.

I plan to add more veggies, perhaps another onion and sliced carrots. I'm also going to add the Cuban chili peppers or a can of Rotel. I had to add hot sauce to each serving. 

All in all I was pleased enough to try again with some modifications.

This was fine -- I thought maybe it would be a little zippier, but maybe it's just not supposed to be zippy.  The kids all liked it and ate it.

Flank Steak was very chewy. I would try London Broil next time. 
Needed more garlic. I doubled the amount. 
Needed salt. I used 1/4 teaspoon. 
The sauce was delicious. Great recipe.

A favorite in demand meal around my house. It also gets great reviews for potlucks! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I tweak the recipe a bit. I add MORE cilantro, cumin and garlic. I also wait to add the bell pepper until the last hour of cooking. We love it served with rice, sour cream, cheese and cilantro. The leftovers usaully go into tacos!

Great Flavor. My house smelled delicious while this was cooking during superbowl pre-game.

Next time i will try to make it thicker. We ate it in taco form and the juice made life difficult for an apartment without a proper dining table.

This was good. I used chuck roast and just skimmed off a lot of the fat before shredding the meat. I added a couple more cloves of garlic than the recipe called for. Next time, I think I would want to add some more spice, maybe a hot pepper or two. Was great over white rice and fried plantains!

This was incredibly flavorful and fork tender.  I served it over rice with a side of black beans.  It served all 6 of us without a single scrap of leftovers as several of us went back for seconds. Will be making this again.

DEE-LISH!!!  I made this dish for my cousin and her husband who is Cuban.  I served it with white rice, black beans, maduros.  Everyone loved it!  Great recipe!  I threw all the ingredients together the night before then turned the crock pot on in the morning before I left for work.  8-9 hours on low was perfect....the meat was tender & flavorful!  LOVE IT!

The tomato flavor overpowered everything else.  Will try using more beef broth and half of the tomato paste or sauce next time.  I also felt it was missing a spice but I'm not sure which.  We added green Tabasco sauce to our plates and it was delicious.

This was SO good. Made the rich mexican corn recipe from this site and had this on homeade tortillas with quacomole and pico and we actually put the corn on the tacos and with this meat it was SOOOO good. My boyfriend even said that this was the best mexican meal he had ever had.

This dish could not be easier to achieve truly Cuban paradise!  I fell in love with this dish when visiting my sister down south but could not find a substitute up north!  I am SO glad to find this easy recipe!  i also upped the garlic and onions (love em!) and the result was fabulous!  Even my "meat and potatoes" fiance had seconds and thirds!

Excellent!  I used flap meat instead and it turned out just as good. Cooked in slow cooker for 6 hours and meat was very tender.  The sauce was a bit bland so I added some seasonings (garlic salt, pepper, etc)  and it turned out great

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! I add a little more garlic, and try not to cook it for the full 4 hours. I serve it with arroz con gandules, shredded lettuce salad, and sourcream and cheddar cheese on the side. GREAT meal!

leave out the sour cream, cheese, and cilantro....not Cuban. If you want a Mexican variation add them. Otherwise pretty close to real thing.

Just add more cilantro, can't go wrong. It's delicious.  I also did not brown the meat, no need.  Looks great, smells fantastic, tastes even better.  I served with sweet potato salad, baked rice pilaf and fried bananas.

This is great! I did make the following changes: 2 lb beef shoulder instead of flank steak and I added a bay leaf and a sprinkling of garlic salt to taste. Serve this over arroz con gondulez (yellow rice and pigeon peas) for a Cuban meal the way Abuela makes it!

Flavor is good, a little runny
