If you want to keep more rhubarb flavour, save the cooking water from step 1 to use as the ingredient water in step 2. Even with half the sugar it's plenty sweet, next time I will use Soda Water instead of lemon-lime pop. A great recipe- and fun to experiment with!

My husband swears this is the BEST slush ever!  I go about making it a little differently.  I put my chopped rhubarb in the saucepan and usually I toss in 1/2-1 c raspberries for color.  Once tender, rather than draining and blending I just use my immersion blender.  Then add the remaining ingredients (but only HALF the SUGAR) and I always use Brandy instead of Gin.  Its so quick and easy - and delicious.

UPDATE:  I made this tonight with Blackberry Brandy and Grape juice concentrate instead of Orange (again 1/2 the sugar).  Delicious!  I think this might be my favorite version now.

Instead on gin I used Maui Tropical Schnapps & that added a nice extra flavor to it. Very good way to use up your Rhubarb!

My company found this drink (I made it virgin) very refreshing.  I plan on keeping a batch in the freezer for unexpected guests.  Great way to use your rhubarb!

It's nice to find a beverage recipe to use all of my rhubarb in.  This one didn't quite have enough rhubarb flavor in it for me, so I added another 1 c of rhubarb.  i also reduced the sugar to 2/3 c instead of 1 c.  That helped.  Next time, I don't think I'll put quite as much orange juice.  That seemed to overpower it a bit.

A good way to use a lot of Rhubarb. I used rum instead of gin and it tasted great. I also recommend using a flavored sparkling H2O instead of pop as this recipe already has a lot of sugar. Four Stars.

I don't quite know where to begin on this one.  It is THE BEST drink ever!  I served it to my neighbors over Memorial Day Weekend, and they are all frantically running out to the farmer's market to buy more rhubarb.  The only thing I changed was I used strawberry vodka instead of gin and served Fresca over the top.  YUMMY!!!

This was a hit at my graduation party. I doubled the recipe and had plenty for everyone (even some left over). I did add more rhubarb and not quite as much sugar as other reviewers suggested. I did not have to puree the rhubarb after boiling either...it was soft enough, that i just took a wisk and stirred it so that any big chunks would fall apart. Thanks for the recipe!

TASTE GREAT--I ONLY ADDED 1CUP OF SUGAR AND NO ALCOHOL--FROZE SOLID!!  NEXT TIME I'LL ADD ALL THE SUGAR IN HOPES IT WON'T FREEZE SO HARD AND THEN MIX WITH CLUB SODA NOT LEMON LIME POP.  EVEN THE KIDS LIKED IT-- AND THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING AT MY HOUSE!

This is a great way to make sure you  pick all the rhubarb. I used vodka instead of gin.I thought it was a bit too sweet. I added a bit of lemon juice at the end in a glass, with the lemon lime soda. I will use less sugar next time. But easy to keep in the freezer. I'm thinking of making the rhubarb patch bigger.

Very good recipe. I used the water that the rhubarb cooked in and it turned out great.  I also made it once with half the sugar & it was fine so that's what I'll do from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe.

When your 10 year old thinks this is great, you've done something right.  The only thing I did different was to decrease sugar per other reviews.  I doubled the batch and did not add the liquor so my kids could have some too.  I will just pour vodka on the individual glasses.  I don't understand how you drain rhubarb after cooking it, and why would you just want the pulp?  Next time I will use the 3 cps. of water over rhubarb and not add the extra water at the end.

I made a batch as part of a camping breakfast.  The slush didn't stay frozen overnight in the cooler so I served it over ice with Diet Sierra Mist .  My fellow campers who are awesome cooks gave the recipe a thumbs up.  Thanks!

It was a good base.  I would cut back on the sugar.  I think adding some fresh ginger would be wonderful, or in the fall, use apple juice instead, and some cinnamon.

This recipe was easy to follow and really didn't take much time.  The flavor is great - I like the mix of oj and lemonade!  My friend has a recipe which calls for strawberry jello - but this recipes makes it a bit more tangy and less sweet.

Loved this idea. I changed it up quite a bit, though. I cooked the rhubarb in 8 cups of water then stirred in 2 tubs(2 quart size) of strawberry Crystal Light drink mix and 2 cups of vodka. I pureed it with my stick blender.It was a big hit on a hot Memorial Day. Very refreshing.

Helps put that rhubarb plant I have in the back yard to good use!  It's yummy and refreshing, we make it without alcohol.  Easy to make up a big batch and freeze.

I made this recipe last Christmas (without the gin) using frozen rhubarb and everyone loved it! It was great to have in the freezer and just add the soda when anyone dropped by.  I am making it again this holiday season.

This was a good slush, but I was hoping for more of a rhubarb taste.  I'll make this again, but maybe double the rhubarb.

This was too sweet for my liking and the orange concentrate over powered the taste. A few changes to make: Use only 1 can pink lemonade, no orange. Add half the sugar. Serve with Club Soda. **Also, use the left over water from the rhubarb pot as the water in recipe to add more rhubarb flavour**

I never considered using rhubarb like this, THANKS.. I think this is really dependent on personal tastes for sweet and tart levels. It really is good AS IS for a mixed group. If you like margaritas... you might try dropping the orange juice adding  some frozen limeade and using tequila. Play with the sugar and consider a salt plate for the glasses.

Very refreshing. For us, the gin didn't add anything (I made it both ways to check); so this is one that could be served to anyone.

I love this recipe but you definitely do not need all the sugar. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and I wish I would have taken the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar in half. I would have liked to taste the tartness of the rhubarb more

I have made this recipe so many times as well as shared it others (after they tried it) more times than I can count!  I make it w/o the alcohol so the kids can have some too! I have made it with both frozen rhubarb but saving the juice once it is thawed for part of the water, and also made it fresh.  It keeps FOREVER, well ok at least several months, until the next batch of rhubarb is ready. I use both lemon/lime soda or lemonade, whichever the person so chooses.  IT IS A MUST at cookouts or just on a nice summer day/evening!!!

I did a few things different.  I used frozen thawed rhubarb and measured out 6 cups of rhubarb with rhubarb juice.  It is puréeable at this stage but you still gotta cook it or you'll get sick.  Ask me how I know!  This increases the rhubarb flavor over the original recipe I'm sure.

I brought the rhubarb up to a boil with the 2 cups sugar and three cups water.  I recommend using the full amount of sugar and using carbonated water later rather than short the sugar and use soda as the mixer because more sugar makes it easier to scoop out and slush up from a frozen state.  Besides, wouldn't you rather have your extra sweetener be sugar rather than HFC?  I agree with most of the other reviewers that it is too sweet if you use all the sugar and then top it off with Sprite.  

I have never in my life seen a 6 oz can of frozen juice, so I used 12 oz.  That was probably wrong.  Next time I will use half of it and see how that goes.  I would like the rhubarb flavor to be dominant.   

Then I doubled the alcohol.  1 cup of gin is not very much for as big as this recipe is and you'll add something fizzy later too.  Alcohol also keeps it scoopable in the freezer, but it's easy enough to add it during serving to keep everybody happy.

I found a new use for my rhubarb. This is a good drink and so handy to have in the freezer.

Just finished making this and used 9 cups rhubarb 1 1/2 cups sugar, small can frozen pink lemonade and small frozen can OJ.   Could not wait to try it and added a scoop into an ice filled glass topped with tonic.  This is great!!!! My husband is a big tonic fan but likes a little something extra in it for a different flavour.  This fills the requirement.

A good refreshing slushy, although I altered it a bit.  First I cut the recipe in half and I think next time I would cut the lemonade and orange juice in half again, it kind of overpowered the rhubarb.  After I cooked the rhubarb I let it cool (while I was making dinner), then I mixed it and the juice concentrates, a bit of water and a bunch of ice in my blender.  It was very refreshing, everyone enjoyed it.

I made this to share with the sailboat crew after a race.  It was surprisingly delicious.  I looked for the recipe as kind of a joke.   "Oh, ya, let's have a drink made with rhubarb!"  Haha.  The joke was on me--it was very good!
