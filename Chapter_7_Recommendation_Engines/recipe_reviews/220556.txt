I made this for our Christmas Eve drop in and it was a huge hit!  My only change was to add in some smoked Gouda Cheese after reading another review, great suggestion.  I served it with a loaf of cubed marble rye/pumpernickel bread and sour dough pretzels!   I plan to make this again for a Super Bowl party!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Everyone loved the beer flavor, which comes through nicely.  My only tip is to leave plenty of time for the cheese-melting step.  It took almost an hour for my crockpot to melt the cheese (on high).

Really good and easy to make.  I added the gouda and the bacon and it was very tasty.  Adjustments for next time:  use a little less beer and shred the gouda so it melts more easily.

Fantastic, huge hit at the party! I took out about 5 oz of the Velveeta and replaced it with a wedge of smoked Gouda with bacon, gave it just a hint of smoky flavor. Just personal preference, I'm sure that strictly adhering to the recipe as written would not have changed my opinion :)

I needed this quicker so like one of the other reviewers, I used my microwave.  I melted the Velveeta on low power in the microwave stirring frequently and added some leftover shredded Gouda. I added the other ingredients along with some bacon crumbles and a little garlic. The flavor was wonderful!  Perfect for soft pretzels and tortilla chips too. Will make this again.

This was yummy and perfect for a party food where you can walk away and come back to something g cooked. My only criticism is the time expectation, this will NOT cook in 30 minutes, someone below said 1 hour but I would give yourself even more time than that so that you are not stressed out!  If it were an option I would put 4.5 stars because of that!  Next time I will try the Gouda!

Liquid crack is how my friends described this cheese dip.  And unlike 95% of the recipes on here this one I followed exactly as described and it turned out great.  Kept it warming in my small slow cooker and folks could not get enough of it!!  Now everyone asks for me to make this at every gathering.

Tasty in that fake cheez kinda way. I did not add the chili powder or cayenne and didn't miss them. Served with homemade soft pretzel sticks, yum, thanks for the recipe Steve!

Great dip! It was a little bit too watery at first but I put it on the stove and reduced it a bit and then it was wonderful! I think this would be great with soft baked pretzels and adding bacon would be even better! The Guinness taste really does come through and blends well with the cheese.

Made according to ingredients, heated in microwave vs slow cooker.  Will cut recipe in half for the future as the batch is quite large.  Served with fresh baked pretzel knots.  Was a huge hit!

I love this dip.  I've been making it for myself and a few friends but it finally got a large test run at a large "Friends Giving", and I watched with a smile as this dip was devoured pretty hard!

Love making this dip.

I made this for Christmas evening snacks and it was really good. Everyone gobbled it up. My only complaint is that it was super thick. Maybe some more beer or even water would have helped.

This was a big hit at a party I made it for. I did scale back the Worcestershire sauce to only one table spoon and I used a dark German malt beer instead of Guinness. The suggestion of adding the smoked Gouda was spot on. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe, it was a huge hit at our house, and the leftovers were used for days for everything from nachos to scrambled eggs!  The only tweak I made to the recipe is I added about 4x the amount of salsa to it and let it cook down in the slow cooker for a few hours.  It still had that robust flavor from the Guinness and Worcestershire sauce but the tomotatoes and spices from the salsa gave it some complexity and a little more “zip”.   Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Definitely will make this one again.

This dip was a huge hit at my last party.  The only thing I would have done to make it better was to add cooked hamburger meat seasoned with taco seasoning.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made 1/2 the recipe and used Mexican velveeta. Did not add the chili powder or cayenne.  Served with soft pretzel nuggets.  It was a big hit on St Paddy’s day

I followed this easy recipe for St. Patrick's Day with Tostitos Multi-grain Scoops. Everything was simple and delicious.

Used 24 oz of Velveeta and 8 oz of smoked Gouda as someone suggested.  Was a huge hit, especially with green apples

Easy recipe.  Since it was just my hubby & I having this, I split the recipe in half & made it in a large pot on our gas stove.  Sprayed the pot w/ Pam & clean up was a breeze. Will be making this again but think I’ll just keep doing it on the stove.

Based on several reviews, we added the Gouda & bacon.  While we had high expectations, we were underwhelmed.  The dip was decent and I think, next time, we'll stick with Rotell & Velveeta.

People could not get enough of this! I served it with soft pretzel nuggets. I added some smoked Gouda and a little bacon, as suggested by other reviewers. Outstanding!

The final product of this recipe comes out delicious!! My only issue is that 20 minutes in a slow cooker came NOWHERE close to melting the cheese. I had friends coming over and I’m standing in the kitchen waiting for this cheese to melt. I ended up dumping the half melted cheese in a bowl and popping it in the microwave to melt faster. After that, I dumped it back in the slow cooker and put the rest of the ingredients in exactly as directed and the dip turned out perfectly! Lots of compliments, and now that I know to allow more time, the next time I make it should go a little smoother.

This recipe, like most on here, is a great base. It goes great with everything. Ive put it on chicken, steak, used it to dip numerous breads and crackers in and haven’t found anything it isn’t good on. Here are my changes. I add 2-3 green onions (depending on the size), 1/2-3/4 of head of fresh garlic (again depends on size), and 2 jalapeños or serano peppers. I also add chipotle powder (about a tbsp). I feel this all compliments the recipe well and helps make it even better.

Nice creamy cheesy dip. Good with chips or with vegetables such as celery or carrots. I added a bit of jalapeño pepper for a little extra zing.

A nice option to the regular Ro-Tel Dip.  It is a bit thicker than I would have expected.  Perhaps more Guinness would help.

Really good.  My version had a good smoky flavor.  I used 24 oz. of Velveeta and 8 oz. of smoked gouda.  I also substituted 1/4 tsp. of smoked paprika for the cayenne.  I think I forgot to put in the Worcestershire, but didn't miss it.  Served it with baked pretzels.  Having leftovers (it was just me and my husband eating this so have leftovers) tonight on top of burgers.  Will be making this again and may or may not add the Worcestershire.

Made it just as directed and it was heavenly! A great dip to bring to a party, as long as you have a place to plug in your crock pot.  Yum.... lots of rave reviews for this.

Added some Gouda as per suggestions and some smoked paprika. This stuff was great! I thinned some of it down and put it on penne last night for dinner (better than mac and cheese), then tonight we ate more of it with tortilla chips. The rest is coming with us to Thanksgiving tomorrow. We really liked the use of Guinness and salsa. They gave it more of a kick than normal beer cheese. Thank you for posting your recipe!

As someone said, leave extra time for the cheese to melt.  I served this with hunks of broken soft pretzels...a big hit!

Delicious. Made this for the family in this wonderful July 4th.
