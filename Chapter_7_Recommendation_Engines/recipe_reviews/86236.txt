Digestive biscuits are a British thing. In Britain, 'biscuits' are what Americans call 'cookies.' Digestive biscuits are high in wheat flour, and are not very sweet. You can eat them on their own with a nice cup of tea, but they are also very good topped with cream cheese. The most popular brand of digestives are made by McVities. I have seen digestive biccies in the 'World Food' aisle of large grocery stores, and also speciality British food shops.

As noted in another review, Digestive Biscuits are a British tradition. The closest American equilevant (sp?) would be Graham Crackers or Nilla Waffers. If using Graham Crackers, use the square section, if using Nilla Waffers, I'd probably add an extra 10-15 more to make up for the density of the Digestives. Best experiment a bit. Either way...these suckers are great!

Are they called "fifteens" because there's 15 of everything, or I'll put on 15 lbs eating these!? Sooo yummy and easy to make. They remind me of something that my grandma would make in the 50's or 60's for a party, so the added kitsch factor is a bonus!

I was introduced to this recipe while student teaching in Ireland.  I had/made them without the coconut and they're still very very good!  Beware you will want to eat the whole batch!

This is a really great recipy, i made these fifteens for my nannys birthday party and eveyone loved them.  by the way, digestives are dry, plain buiscuites, the other girl was right that they can be eaten on their own or with something else.  i live in Ireland so i have them all the time.  you can get them with chocolate on them already but for this recipy you would need to buy plain ones.  an ordinary plain buiscute would probably do if you cannot get digestives.

Oh my, oh my!!! I used graham cracker as suggested by other reviewers. Loved Sarahbean007's comment re putting on 15 lbs. It can easily happen with these little beauties. Also, I put my coconut on a jelly roll pan for easy clean up. This is my official neighbor give-aways this Christmas season! Delicious and addictive.

Please note this is based on changes I made, not how the recipe is written. I know some people get mad when they see ratings like this, but I actually like knowing what variations do and don't work in a recipe... especially a recipe where the called-for ingredients are hard to find. 

Anyway... I used about 25ish Costco Animal Crackers and dried cherries instead of candied. If I make this again, I'll triple the dried cherries and toast the coconut. Then it'll be 5 stars.

I used graham crackers instead of digestive biscuits, it’s not exactly the same, but it’s really good.  So to anybody who can’t really get a hold on digestive biscuits , it’s a decent substitute.

I had these at the home of Irish friends, only without the cherries. So yummy! These are not cookies or biscuits, these are candy! I am going to attempt a healthy version with unsweetened coconut and yogurt cheese in place of the condensed milk. But for a party treat, why not?

Sorry, but this just did not work for me and I followed the recipe exactly, including biscuits which I found at WalMart. The dough was too soft even after refrigeration to work with. I finally got it to work by putting a pecan half ans twy chocolate cherry chips in mini muffin cups sprayed with Pam. Then I covered them in liquid cherry chips and froze then. My wife liked then. If you are into thick, gooey, cherry, go for it.

oh my, who would have believed that it was gonna be such a great hit?? I must confess that I made it more for the colors than anything else (my daughter's party, we needed something with pastel colors, and it complimented the pastel-colored little paper cups we had chosen...). So I used pink, yellow and pale blue striped marshmallows. Then I went on making mistakes: I forgot to buy the required Digestives, and we only had amaretti (of all things!!! I didn't even remember why we had these). Then I got confused and threw the whole cup of coconut into the mix, instead of saving it to powder the sausage of dough! so I had to add more milk.
I simply thought I was headed for disaster. Well, I got rave reviews, people asking for the recipe all over the place, and many kept repeating This is insanely addictive!!! I can't wait to do it right:-)
