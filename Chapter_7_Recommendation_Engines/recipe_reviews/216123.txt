This recipe is a keeper! I did not have corn tortillas but I did have spinach tortillas which added color. I used red and green peppers and added black beans. It was beautiful, perfect for the holiday season.

This recipe was a hit!!!  I added a half of red bell pepper (because it was in my fridge).  I also used whole wheat tortillas, to make it slightly more healthy.  Tasted so so good!  Makes great left-overs!

This was very delicious! This was actually one of the first meals I have ever made. I didn't put the corn in, but I did add black beans and sliced jalapenos(soaked in brine) to add a little heat. I'm very happy of how it turned out!

The combination of these ingredients was great.  I didn't like how the tortillas came out kind of mushy, however.  Next time I would consider making the bake the same, and heating the tortillas seperate.  Then we could just spoon the mix on to the tortillas.

Good recipe enjoyed by the whole family. Only changes I made was use chili peppers as opposed to green, mixed a can of enchilada sauce with the sour cream, and added a little bit more chicken.

If you don't like corn tortillas, like me, use flour tortillas.   Make the recipe as suggested without adding tortillas,  Then fill flour tortillas w/mixture. Roll up.
REally good that way!

I used this recipe as a basic starting point for my own. I cut the chicken into tiny cubes and mixed with a tsp of fajita seasoning, 1/2 tsp of mesquite seasoning, and 1/2 tsp of lime juice. I cooked the chicken in a skillet with some chopped jalepenos. Once the chicken was cooked, I added a can of Rotel and a can of black beans. I mixed a cup of sour cream and a can of enchilada sauce together. Then layered in a sprayed baking dish starting with tortillas, then chicken mix, then sour cream mix, and then cheese. Repeated. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes uncovered. Turned out very yummy! Could prob also use half corn/half black beans too.

I made this for the first time last night and thought it was very good! I put more chicken than it calls for and I used a red pepper. but other than that I stayed with the recipe. The bottom layer of the tortillias got crunchy which made it hard to cut but other than that it was a wonderful dish that we will def. be making again.. next time I may even add mushrooms and some other things to spice it up

This was a big hit at our house.  I added half of a red, orange, yellow, and green peppers,  a jar of velveeta salsa con queso, 1 can of hot enchilada sauce and Jalapenos. Turned out awesome.... I also used flour tortillas instead of corn.

This was delicious!  Just make sure you cover it!  I forgot and it was a little dry.  But, the second time I made it, I remembered and it was great!  I think next time I will try flour tortillas instead of corn.

Wonderful as written. I added one Jalapeno pepper for a little bit of zip...and probably put in 2 cups of cheese; used drained canned corn. Wonderful flavor...husband said to put it on the "favorites" list! Thanks~

It was a little too bland. Next time I will add jalapenos and hotter picante. I liked the crunchy corn totillas after baking. I thought that was a good feature of the dish. I used Green Giant Southwestern corn instead of regular corn - I recommend that in most dishes liek this one.

Two kids (10 and 16) and a husband gave this dish 5 stars.  I added black beans to mine and used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut fat an add protein. The best part is this is a gluten free dish!

My family of 7 can't get enough of this. I add black beans to the recipe and I've started having to make 2 casseroles at a time to ensure we have the requested leftovers the next day.

You can leave out the tortillas for a low carb dish.  I've made this with both shredded chicken and shredded flank steak that I shredded in my food processor (a few short pulses is all you need).  Turns out great!  Thanks for the recipe and idea!

Absolutely delicious -- Made on a Monday and it was gone by Wednesday night (just me and my husband).  I subbed lowfat/light ingredients and added black beans... I think it was better reheated than fresh out of the oven!  Delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly, this did not taste good at all.
