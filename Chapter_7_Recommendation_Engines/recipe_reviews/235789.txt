I feel bad giving a lower rating and I'm not new to kale but I felt this was in need of some sweetness. I added a small amount of agave otherwise we would have likely not eaten it. I found the red wine vinegar harsh and fresh OJ is a must to help the balance. Also must sit overnight. Portions are very small if serving 4 as the kale wilts down. I did like the idea of the nuts,seeds and fruit. Thanks sydneyt

I've never tried the "grocery store salad" but have coworkers who rave about a specific one that sounds very similar.  This is OUTSTANDING!  We love kale, and wilting it in this salad gives us another way to enjoy it.  My 11 year old daughter is excited to pack this in her lunch for tomorrow.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I really like this, but I think it should be stated to use FRESH OJ in this.  I used bottled, and think fresh would have added the nice sweetness this needed for me...  Good overall..will make again :)

Entirely too much soy sauce...and really too much dressing. I added some honey to make it palatable.

I just had this salad from a local grocery store and loved it! I was so excited to find the recipe. I think this will be included in my Easter dinner. It's deliciously fresh and flavorful. The cranberries and the hint of citrus from the orange juice paired so well that it brought out all the other flavors beautifully! :)

I enjoyed the flavors of this dish. I would recommend that the author specify how much a ‘bunch’ of kale is. Hard to say when it comes from your garden... big bunch, small bunch? Would be helpful to have an estimate of # of cups. I had too much liquid when making this, which I assume means that I needed to use more kale.

I generally find that I am completely on board with other reviewers, but I flip-flopped between giving this recipe three stars and four stars.  I love kale and eat a lot of it in various forms, but this recipe (which I made with freshly squeezed orange juice) was just a bit too tart for me.  I ended up sprinkling sugar over the salad when serving it in an effort to sweeten it up a bit.  I think that this recipe is well-done if this is the flavour you are seeking (hence the four stars rather than three), but I personally didn't love it.

I love this salad from the grocery store and was very excited to find a recipe for it. I think it is very close but there is something slightly off that I can't put my finger on. The biggest change I made is that I did not sauté the kale as I thought that would wilt it too much. Instead I massaged it with a sprinkle of salt before combining it with the salad dressing. I also did not use all of the dressing that was made - probably 1/2 to 3/4 of it. Finally marinating is very important, in fact, I thought it tasted better the second day than it did the first day. This is definitely a keeper!

I didn't have any orange juice so I used Tang.  I just added it dry.  It is a little sweeter but I prefer it made this way.

I've tried this from our local whole food store and thought this was similar. I followed the recipe and thought the kale was too cooked at the end. Too wilted from the heat, my son said it lacked sweetness and said it resembled cooked spinach. Worth a try but not for us after all.

I'm a bit of a lazy cook, and was short on time. Didn't cook the kale; used it raw with a mix of curly lettuce and grape tomatoes, and feta. Great dressing, but I felt it needed some added zest! I added a generous teaspoon of Dijon mustard. Turned out super!

I loved the salad. I followed the recipe exactly, only I toasted both pumpkin seeds and almonds. I did not feel it was not sweet enough. After all, it is a salad, not a desert :)

My whole family liked this.  I used fresh OJ based on the other reviews, otherwise followed this exactly.

My husband loved this and I thought it was pretty good and looking forward to the leftovers.  I did make some tweaks: halved the dressing.  Used Allspice instead of ginger because that is what I had on hand.  I also added a little bit of Splenda based on other comments about needing to balance the acid of the vinegar.  I topped with some goat cheese crumbles right before serving because that makes everything better :)
