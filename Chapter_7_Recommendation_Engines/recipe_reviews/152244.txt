Despite the one negative review, tried this recipe and was sooooo glad! Served hot, this chicken was moist and had a delicate, fresh flavor. Just right for a refined palate!!!! The real surprise came 3 hours later when when snacking on leftovers. Served cold the flavor of the joney and the cinnamon jumps right out and smacks you. So, I say, serve it hot for a light refreshing taste,or,serve it cold for a less sensite palate.

Tried this recipe tonight - did not have enough honey to add in, but I did add garlic to the flour mixture.  Everyone in my family LOVED these nuggets.  Even frying them, they still came out very, very tender and juicy.  There were absolutely no leftovers and I'm craving more!

When I read this recipe, I was excited about the combination of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out just OK, though moist and different...We may do this again, mainly because my picky 2 year old liked them!! But thanks for the new recipe!!!

We really enjoyed these. Very easy to make. The cinnamon adds that touch of difference. You don't even need any sauce to dip them in.

I have great difficulty in following a recipe, for many reasons.  The main one being family allergies.  I substitued rice milk, omited the egg and didn't mesure a thing.  Myself and my oldest son really liked it.  The 2-year old who is allergic to nothing wouldn't try it and the 5-year old it was altered for didn't like it, but that is our normal.  I'm glad I tried it and would recommend it for something slightly different from the usual.

these were good.  But tasted like they were missing something. Tried dipping in Honey Mustard.  That helped but still...something was missing.  i will make them again but with some experimenting.

i wanted to try something different for my daughter and these sounded good...they're not!  i baked them and they stuck so bad it pulled all the stuff off the top of it and we lost all the cinnamon....they were bland and just not good!  very disappointed in the waste of the ingredients!

Not great. The chicken stuck to the pan and  we could barely taste the cinnamon. Very dry. Very dissapointed. Will NOT make again.

They were ok but it tasted like something was missing.  I will have to experiment.  But they were really easy and quick.

I made this recipe and was disappointed. With the amount of cinnamon used that this recipe calls for I expected a much bolder flavor. I won't be making this one again.

Not too much a fan. I had high hopes for this recipe but it missed the mark. I needs something else like a chipotle chili powder to counter balance the sweetness from the honey and sugar.

I made this last night for my family, and we loved it!  it was FULL of flavor for us, and so moist. I cut them a little to small at first, so they started out a little to crispy, but once i made them about fastfood restaurant nugget-sized, they cooked verry well. But the bad thing is, if you have a deep fryer, this ruins the oil in it so you cant reuse it, but that happens with any thing that has a coating in it in the fryer.
