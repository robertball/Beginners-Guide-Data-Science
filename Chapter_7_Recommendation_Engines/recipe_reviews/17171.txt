Great recipe, but I changed it a little since I had seasoned my turkey heavily to cook it - with rosemary, sage, and thyme.  I did not cook ingredients 2-9 with my carcass, just cooked the carcass in water with bouillon cubes, and then pulled out the bones, cooled it, and removed the fat.  Then I added ingredients 13-19, and onion, celery, mushrooms, and garlic.  I served it with sour dough bread - WOW!

I made this soup on Dec. 26 with the leftover turkey from a big family Christmas dinner. My grandmother always makes turkey soup the day after Christmas, and I wanted to learn to do the same.  This makes a nice, tasty soup - though I did make a few minor changes.  I substituted 2 yams for the parsnips and wide egg noodles for the beans.  This will become a regular "after-the-holiday" meal.

This was the best poultry soup I've ever made.  Even the neighbors were raving about it, as all my leftovers went to them.  Followed the recipe almost to the T, except for a few more dashes of spices here and there.

Great tasting soup!  I took another reviewers advice and substituted egg noodles for the red beans and added a small amount of onion, celery and white wine to the last step. I am not a big parsnip fan, however I really did like them in this soup.  Very tasty and will be making again.

This is the best homemade soup I have ever made!! So great for that Thanksgiving turkey carcass. I did not refrigerate overnight - just skimmed off the fat and it worked great. I used "Better than Bouillon" instead of granules and egg noodles instead of kidney beans and even my  husband who is not a soup fan could not stop saying how good it was!!

I love the way my turkey soup came out but I changed this recipe a bit.  I followed the first part pretty closely except for adding about 1 cup of white wine. During the second part I added a little more white wine and pepper for flavor, 3-4 stalks chopped celery and 1 chopped onion. I skipped all of the beans and turnips. I never thought I liked parsnips but it turns out I love them in soup!

So far so good - I haven't actually tasted it yet - just smelled it. It does look very flavourful. My only criticism would have to do with the copious amount of thyme called for in the recipe. There's such a thing as too much of a good thyme!

The Turkey soup has a good flavor and an interesting taste withthe additon of the turnips and parsnips. I don't think the beans were necessary to add to the overall flavor. All in all the soup was hearty and colorful.

This soup tasted fine, but a bit bland. Most of the flavor came from the delicious turkey stock, but the finish on the recipe left much to be desired. Next time I would throw in some sage, or maybe cook some wild rice in with the stock to give it more body. Not bad at all, but certainly not great. On a positive note, I've never considered putting turnips or parsnips in a poultry soup, and they were GREAT!

Everyone loved this but, it was a bit too brothy for my taste. Going to have to tweak it  a bit.

Wow!-5th time we made this. Great every time. We use the carcass from the rosemary roasted turkey recipe also from allrecipes. We use up to 2 gallons of bottled water in a 16qt pot because our carcass comes from a 25lb+ turkey cut in small pieces (use the neck-toss the giblets). We treat this as a double recipe. We always seem to have extra carrots and celery that we end up tossing so we have found that by tripling the ingredients except the parsley in the beginning really deepens the flavor. It gets strained in the beginning so the veggies are only used for the broth (save some carrots for the final Soup). Be VERY choosy when deciding what meat to use for the soup, the last thing you want is skin/gristle/fat/bone in your final soup. We cut it into 2" pieces when possible then shred it. Don't be shy when skimming the fat. We remove about 1/2" from the top when skimming the gelatinous gold broth. We found that using a large table spoon instead of a slotted worked best, easier to handle and picked out large chunks instead of breaking it up. For us the right amount of seasoning is about 1/4c of kosher salt (or 1/8c table salt) and 1/4c black pepper. We like it spicy so unless you want it with some zip you may want to cut back on the pepper. After adding the beans/peas we just turn off the heat. There is enough residual heat to warm them through, otherwise they get mushy. After all is said and done we end up with about 9-10qts of soup. Serve it on some whole grain pasta-Yummy!

I thought this had a nice flavor.  I did add 1/3 cup brown rice during the last hour of cooking.  I couldn't wait to eat it so I didn't put it overnight in the refrigerator.  I didn't make it right at Thanksgiving as we already had so much food to eat. I put the carcass and some extra turkey in the freezer and made it for New Years.

Tasty and easy way to finish all the yummy bits left on your turkey.  I was a little off-put by the amount of garlic it called for, but went ahead and put the whole four cloves in.  What a difference it made in the flavor of the stock!  I didn't let my stock sit overnight, but instead let it stand on the stovetop and cool for 30 minutes - I found it to be plenty of time for the fat to separate.  After successfully cooking my first turkey, this made for an easy meal the day after Thanksgiving.

This was soooooooo good! Even my picky husband loved this vegetable soup. I followed the recipe exactley (no noodles needed), except I only let the broth refrigerate a couple of hours, instead of over night. I can't wait for next Thanksgiving, so I can make it with my leftover turkey again.

Good strating pont. I use leeks in my stock instead of onions and you can taste the difference. I also used canned turkey broth but all of this is up to the individual cook. make it your own!

This was a time-consuming rather messy process but broth was delicious. Soup made with it was good with addition of parsnips and turnips too. Made enough for dinner and to freeze for later as well, at least 16 cups.

Adding turkey with the vegetables for making soup is the best option for our breakfast. Soups are light food and healthy for us.

I made this today and pretty much followed the recipe. I used the carcass of our TG turkey and TG turkey breast, plus some white meat I had frozen, so there was more white meat than dark. The beans made a colorful presentation and also an unexpectedly good taste. I only had bouillon cubes so I ended up adding 4 of them and some extra salt. I didn't have a stock pot large enough to submerge the carcasses so I used an old roasting pan. The liquid covered most of the meaty parts. I didn't have a lot of broth at the end so I added another two cups of liquid. The soup was thick and we had it for dinner with some rolls I had baked and frozen. My husband and I were dubious about it but it turned out very good. If I make it again I think I will used noodles.

I was looking for a recipe to use up 2 fresh turkey legs and found this one. I substituted potatoes for the turnip and parsnips, and used fresh green beans instead of frozen. It was a delicious soup and would definitely make this one again. Thanks!
