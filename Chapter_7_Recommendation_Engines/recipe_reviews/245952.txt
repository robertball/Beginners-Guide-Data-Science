I cooked the bacon in a 10" cast iron skillet and then used that same skillet to make the casserole in.   I thought the 1 tablespoon of garlic powder might be too much for us, so I used 1 teaspoon and it was just enough.   The bacon was a little too done, next time I would dice the bacon and just partially cook it and let it finish cooking in the oven.   I think this would be great with sausage or even ham.   Hubby says 'thanks' for a nice breakfast.

I used browned hash browns on the bottom and cooked hot sausage instead of bacon. Seriously delicious!!! We didn't have left overs!

1 tablespoon of pepper was to much for our taste. Thinking it should be 1 teaspoon. Next time I will put bacon on top of potatoes to keep it from getting to crispy.

Very tasty, but I didn't make exactly as per the recipe. I under-cooked the chopped bacon a little (used a cast iron pan that later went into the oven with the whole mix), and fried the onions and garlic with it. I cut down the pepper to about 1 tsp, added sliced fresh mushrooms, and eliminated the egg/milk mixture altogether. Just mixed the veggies and bacon in the cast iron pan I cooked up the bacon/onions in, and topped it all with cheddar cheese, and baked for about 40 minutes. We had it for supper, and the family really enjoyed it.

Great recipe! Should have made it in a smaller casserole dish so it would be thicker.My husband has leftovers for two lunches. I have a bunch of bacon left so I may make it tonight!

a full tbsp of garlic powder and pepper sounded like too much, so I cut both by half.  and I would probably go with more like 1.5 cups cheese.  maybe add small pieces of broccoli for texture. otherwise delicious and went over very well with my easter brunch crowd!

Loved it.
We cut the recipe in half, but used 4 eggs instead of 3.
Used a bit of pepper and  no salt, 6 month aged cheddar.
Lightly sautéed the cut veggies in a bit of olive oil first (did not sauté the potatoes).
We cooked the bacon separately.
We baked it in a casserole dish and topped with salsa.
Next time we may add some cilantro.

I made it strictly by the recipe, it was awesome. I will definitely make it again, and will probably experiment with additional meats and veggies. I can absolutely see mushrooms and ham in the future!

It's a good base. I used yellow potatoes and onion Just looking at the recipe I knew the salt & pepper amt wasn't right. I think about 2 tsp max. Especially if you use pork bacon, sausage crumbles etc.  I don't eat pork so I used turkey bacon cooked and diced. I added turkey kielbasa, tomatoes, fresh parsley. Didn't have enough cheddar so I added Monterey jack slices. It came out really good.

First try on this one - came out very good.  I made a couple of changes - tsp of pepper and garlic powder (Tbls seemed like a lot) / uses a 9x9 glass casserole dish (made the pieces thicker).

I made this dish with different veggies like spinach, and used hash brown for the potatoes and it came out great. The reason I have it a 3 was due to the clean up after.

Absolutely delicious. Used yukon potatoes, instead of red. Added ham with bacon and used Gouda cheese. Incorporated a basil pesto to the egg mixture. Rich and flavorful.

Minor modifications.  Chop the bacon before cooking.  Replace garlic powder with fresh minced garlic browned in the bacon fat.  Skip the skimmed milk.  Use 2 cups egg substitute such as Egg Beaters instead of fresh eggs.  Southwestern Egg Beaters is best.
