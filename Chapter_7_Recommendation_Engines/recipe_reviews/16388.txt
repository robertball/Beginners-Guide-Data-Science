This recipe sounded really good but my husband and I didn't like it at all.  Since we have so much deer meat, we sure had high hopes but the tomato/sour cream sauce just tasted odd to us.

This is a great meal.  The taste is very well and not wild at all. I added not enough sour cream and the taste was a bit strong on the tomato but that was my fault. Make sure you keep the tomato and sour cream in proportion. My 5 year old ate 3 helpings.

This was a good one. I love deer, yet this was lacking just a little something for me. Everyone else in the house liked it though.

You never said what cut of meat ( ground, cubed, or roast ) !!! I suggest that if it is not ground you remove all traces of fat!!! It will improve the flavor. I was not impressed with this recipe...left something to be desired.

I have never cooked venison before. My husband's dad brought us meat all packaged and labeled. I found this recipe and decided to give it a go. So happy I did. He loved, I loved it. Totally hooked now. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, added about a 1/4 cup Sierra Nevada Porter (beer) and used tomato sauce I previously made from our garden tomatoes. I had to cook it longer (1 1/2 hours) on simmer with a covered lid to make it more tender. Other then the few changes I made I followed your recipe leaving nothing out. So glad I did. Served with fresh sliced heirloom tomatoes. This was a wonderful first time venison recipe for me. Thank you so much for sharing.

Very nice.   We had some leftover grilled venison steak so I fixed this recipe (excluding the browning steps).   We thought it was delicious.

This is a great recipe for someone like me who dows not like their venison to taste like venison.  I put too much tomato paste in this (wanted to use up what I had), but was still delicous.  I served it over rice and my fiance and I really enjoyed it.

"Home run" was my husband's co-workers' exact words when they tasted this dish! It wasnt gamy at all, and the flavours blended together wonderfully. Saving this one for sure!

delicious -- I added a little more fresh garlic and a little more salt.  Goes great with rice on the side or together.

I made this for my parents the other night and they loved it.  I would have given 5 stars, but I didn't really care for it.  I may have overdone the dry mustard, and I served it over angel hair pasta.

This sauce for this recipe was too thick...almost like a dip.  I added water and that helped but unfortunately the bland taste could not be helped...I added some crushed red pepper for spice....but still it lacked any real taste.

We didn't like this at all.  The sauce was to think and just not right for deer.  I took the meat out, rised it and fried it with onions.

The sour cream gave the dish a pungent flavor. We managed to salvage the meat and cover it in barbeque sauce.

My husband loved it!  He was very impressed with the sauce.  I added about 1/4 cup of ranch dressing, it gave the sauce a zing.  He said he would love to have this again.

I found this to be a great recipe.  I used elk though instead of deer I wanted a recipe to help take away the wild taste but couldn't find anything for elk so I decided to try and find something for deer thats when I found this recipe.  It worked great I will be making this again in the future, my kids even loved it.!!!

Not a very appealing or tasty recipe. The sauce ended up being like ketchup on the meat. I would not recommend it.

Very good, no gamey taste. I told the kids it was flank steak (and let them assume that meant beef) and it got rave reveiws.  Being new to cooking venison steaks, I added a few steps: rinsed meat, then soaked about 15 minutes in salt water. Cut steaks into serving sized pieces for the recipe.

Wonderful, thanks for this.  My family loves venison and would eat it every day if we could get it and have different recipes for it.  Well, you just gave me another.  Thank you so much.

This was my first experience cooking deer meat of any sort and it was UH. MAZING! I was worried about it having a "gamey" taste but I didn't notice anything. In fact, my chicken-only-wife said it was really good as well — and it doesn't even taste like chicken! The changes I had to make were using ground venison and tomato sauce instead of paste, but it was still wonderful. I will definitely be keeping this one in the rotation.

We had no idea what to expect with this one.  I was craving mac and cheese and needed an easy protein to accompany it.  I remembered we had some venison tenderloin in the freezer (thanks, Mr. LTH) and decided to give this a whirl and give it a "face".  It doesn't specify what cut to use, so I'm not sure if I used the "right" cut or not.   I also question some of the methodology (I'd have sautéed onions, mushrooms, and garlic first, then seared the beef...I'd also have mixed all of the "other" ingredients together before adding them), but it came together better than expected at the onset.  It wasn't gamey, but it was tough (and I'd simmered for 2 hours).  Worth trying, particularly if you're familiar with cooking venison and can make the game time adjustments necessary.  THANKS for the recipe!

not bad flavor.  We had some chunk deer meat so I used it and yes simmering is key.  My son who doesn't care for deer liked it so I am happy.

This turned out amazing! I didn't have any mustard powder and used cumin instead. It tasted really good with it and this is going to be my go-to from now on!

This recipe was very good! My family and I really enjoyed the tangyness of the sour cream with the sweet of the tomato. I used tomato sauce instead of paste and it still turned out a little pasty I think next time I won't use the flour. I served it over steamed white rice my whole family enjoyed it

This dish was extremely bland and much too tomatoey.  The tomato paste was overwhelming.  I served it over rice.  I ate it (although I'm not very picky), but my husband who is not a tomato lover only ate a couple of bites.

I haven't tried the recipe yet to be honest but I'm thinking maybe try tomato sauce or tomato soup instead of the paste. Paste has a much stronger taste to it than a soup or sauce does and tends to "take over" the taste of a dish. Plus like others said this doesn't say what type of deer meat to use.
