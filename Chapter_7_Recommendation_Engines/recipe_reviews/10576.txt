Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookie so I have tried 20+ recipes.  This one is great HOWEVER turn the oven down a little  - a tad below 375 degrees and be sure to use small scoops.  Too big and they won't cook in the center.  Always use room temp butter and eggs use the freshest ingredients possible and of the best quality you can afford.

This is the same recipe my family has used for as long as I can remember.  It uses butter instead of shortening, which I definitely prefer.  I do not like to use shortening in anything.  Also, it uses less butter/fat than other recipes, but the cookies still taste great.  This is a classic snickerdoodle recipe and I always get rave reviews when I make them.  For those who said the cookies didn’t bake well, I think the problem may have been your oven or the ingredients and not the recipe, because these always turn out perfectly for me. They are simple and fast to make and I almost always have the necessary ingredients in my kitchen.

These are the best snickerdoodles Ive ever had. The cream of tarter doesn't really matter if it is added. I personally think they taste better that way.

Just made these - Great recipe and the taste is wonderful :)  Only thing I found was that the dough was sticky to roll in my hands but I found a very simple and quick solution of wetting my hands with water before rolling the balls. Worked wonderfully, no more sticky and also rolling in the cinnamon/sugar mixture sticked to the balls better.  Great recipe!

These cookies were really disappointing.
Not at ALL the usual snickerdoodle cookie we all grew up with. They dont spread and stay in mounds.  The flavor isn't anything wonderful, as it is a cookie that seems dry and light on flavor. My suggestion, find a new recipe when looking for snickerdoodle, pass this one up.

Good recipe!  I followed exactly, except I baked slightly under 400 degrees (390), smashed the cookies a little with the bottom of a juice glass and baked for 8 min. 15 sec.  They came out great!

I didn't have cream of tartar, and these still came out fabulous. I was really craving cookies and needed a simple ingredient list since I don't have much. My favorite part is how the edges are crispy while the center stays chewy for days. I can't wait to make these for my family for the holidays.

These are better than any Snickerdoodles I've ever tried, and I've made many different recipes.  I don't like the flat, crispy ones that most recipes make.  These are soft and thick.  Very yummy!  I made these several times this fall/winter, and they were always eaten up right away.
Oh, and I don't normally like to eat cookie dough - but this one is very good - hard to stay out of!
Thanks for the great recipe!

These taste just like my Grandma's snickerdoodles! I made them for a party and they were gobbled up. 
Tip: for special Christmas snickerdoodles, die the sugar red and/or green and the cookies have the crackled look, but festive!

We used eggbeaters and I didn't have the cream of tarter and they still went over great.  I would make this recipe again.

Absolutely awesome.  Creamed just the butter and sugar first then added in the other moist ingredients,  Used my stand mixer and gradually added in the dry that I had first mixed in a bowl.  Baked at 375 for 9 minutes.  Used 3 T sugar and 1 1/2 t cinnamon for rolling them in.  Flattened slightly with my fingers before baking.  One of the best cookies I have ever had.

The substitute for cream of tartar is to omit baking soda and cream of tartar and replace with baking powder in the same amount so I used 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder in this recipe. Made with no vanilla. The topping was about 2x too much - could have halved it. Made with cold butter and these were very fluffy and good - could have cooked longer but enjoyed. Thanks!

Tried this recipe because I can't find my original recipe for snicker doodles.  These were not as good as ones I have made before.  The recipe doesn't specify it, but you should flatten the cookie with a fork or glass bottom before baking.  I had to throw the first dozen away because they came out like golf balls and they were uncooked on the inside. Flattened the rest and they came out much better, prettier too, with a crinkled edge. Even if you flatten them, they do not spread much. Make the balls on the larger side.

I didn't really care for Snickerdoodles, but now I'm a firm believer in them! I love how this recipe doesn't call for shortening (I never have any on hand) and the only change I made was substitute the tartar (I never have any of that either) for 2 tsp of vinegar. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. They melt in your mouth! Edit: Be careful not to over bake. They're hard as a rock if you do!

Snickdoodle contest: First Place We tried two recipes and this one got the best vote hands down with my family. The dash of vanilla in this recipe and the soft centers made these a hit!!

This recipe is delicious, but I suggest a few modifications:

1. I added cinnamon to the dough, as I did not want the cookie to have only a hint of cinnamon. I'm not sure that it made much of a difference, but the flavor of the cookies was excellent.

2. Be careful when you roll the balls not to make them two large. My first cookie sheet I made them too big and the cookies, though tasty, were a bit big and crunchy to be palatable. The smaller ones turned out better.

3. Though the smaller rolled balls turned out better, I think the cookies would have been better still if I had flattened them some before baking so they would have cooked more evenly.

These are some of the best snicker doodles I have ever tasted! The first time I made them 10 minutes didn't seem to be enough, the cookies were too soft. I put them in for another 3 minutes, still soft. 3 more, still soft. I took them out then to cool and they hardened up quickly! This time I only put them in for 10 minutes before taking them out and they were perfect. A great recipe!

I had attempted a different snickerdoodle recipe last year that I received from a coworker and it bombed big time. Since then, I have been on the hunt for a decent recipe and so far, this one is pretty good. I unfortunately couldn't locate my cream of tartar, so after googling, I substituted baking powder for both the cream of tartar and baking soda. I baked these at 350 degrees for 11 minutes and they came out soft and chewey. A few days later and they're still soft. I did add more vanilla to the batter, I didn't measure so approximately another teaspoon. I would make these again :)

I really love the texture of this cookie, which is what food is all about for me. It has a dense crusty edge and soft center. 
 I know it's a sugar cookie, but the sugar is a bit much for me, so next time I will cut back on the sugar a bit and see how it goes.
I subbed whole wheat flour for half of flour and you'd never know it. May up the wwflour next time too. 
These are perfect cookies for baking with kids, mine love rolling into balls and swirling in the sugar mix. We had a great time making these this afternoon.

I love this recipe, but i found it easier to put sugar and cinnamon mixture in a tupperware container. That way you could roll the cookies in a ball, place them in the container, put the top down, and shake it :) hope the hint helps :)

My four and seven year old made these, with a little supervision and they turned out absolutely delicious!!  Even when my daughter added 1/2 tsp. too much baking soda.  :)  Love them and have added this recipe to my box.  They are the perfect combination of crispy edges and soft middles.  I baked them on 375 for 8 min.

these are great.  i took the advise of a previous reviewer and reduced the heat to 375 and wet my fingers before rolling the dough.  there is definitely TOO much cinnamon in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  i had to add almost two more tbsp of sugar to the mixture.

Fabulous! I made these as gifts for Christmas and everyone loved them. I prefer a bit chewier cookie, so I cooked them for slightly less time, about 7 minutes. Will definitely be making these again!

Best snickerdoodles ever! And they came out just as pretty as they were in the picture! The only thing I changed was reduced sugar to 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup. Perfect!

I tried this recipe only because others called for shortening while this one did not. I am so glad I did! My wife totally loved these as a surprise for her and they also make a great sugar cookie as well. Just roll in sugar instead of cinnamon sugar. I also tried with nesquik mix and they were not bad either. I love recipes which can be so versatile! Thanks so much!

Excellent! Perfect! I had no troubles with this recipe at all. I did make two small changes to suit my tastes: I added an extra T butter and swapped out 1/2 c white sugar for light brown sugar. They turned out so very perfectly!

Fantastic! I love this recipe, and so does every person who tries this. One declared it tasted almost exactly like his Austrian grandmother's, except it needed a dash of nutmeg. I will do that next time. I originally added a splash of almond extract to it, and a few sprinkles of cinnamon in the batter. They stay soft for a few days, even on the counter on a plate. Fabulous!!

Despite the other reviews, I think these cookies were flavorful and delicious. They were very easy to make and didn't take that long to bake. The only thing that worried me was that when I was mixing the dough, the dough was incredibly crumbly and didn't look like normal cookie dough. But I worked with it, and they turned out fine. Very kid friendly! I definitely recommend these to everybody!!

9-22-2016  ~As I mixed the dough it was a little dry but I plowed on. I chilled it for a couple of hours and still found it on the dry side and more difficult to roll into balls than it should have been. The temperature was fine, no issue there.They were beautiful – not too thick, not too thin. I ate the first while it was still warm and wanted to pretend I didn’t detect a floury taste. No, they’re ok I thought and they were, but just okay. They were a little floury tasting, and a little eggy tasting too. I tried another after it had cooled and what I feared proved to be the case– what had been a soft and tender cookie with crispy edges when it was warm from the oven quickly turned into a dry, crunchy cookie once it cooled; not the characteristics you want in a Snickerdoodle.  A quick review of other Snickerdoodle recipes bore my suspicion out - there was fully 50% less fat than in virtually every recipe I looked at for the same amount of flour, sugar and eggs! Cookie kind of dry, not tender? Not enough fat can be the cause. What I gleaned from other recipes is that this WOULD have been a first rate cookie with the simple addition of a half cup of shortening.  A little extra vanilla wouldn’t hurt either.  I don’t want to say I didn’t like these, tho’ on a measure of what a good Snickerdoodle is, I didn’t.  It is an okay cookie I guess, it’s just not an okay Snickerdoodle.  Note: Hubs just tried a couple and said, “I don’t know, I think these are pretty darn good.”

I have been making snickerdoodles for years with a recipe a friend gave me.  I had lost the recipe and this one looked similar to my tried and true one.  I was very disappointed.  They did not have a delicious butter flavor and were not moist.  I tried baking them less, but not much could salvage them.  Maybe I'm used to my old recipe, but I was embarrassed to serve these to my guests.  I'm going to post the recipe when I get a new copy from my friend.  :0(

These came out great but, after reading other reviews about the cookies being dry & hard the next day- I looked at the butter to flour ratio and increased the butter to 1 cup total (that's what my chocolate chip cookie recipes call for) anyways the end result was so good & chewy even the next day. I didn't have cream of tartar don't know how that would improve it any. These were a hit with everyone. Will make again. Thanks.

What I liked best about these is that they have half the fat (most snickerdoodle recipes call for a whole cup of shortening - no thanks!) but the same taste you look for when making these. I made a batch and froze them for school lunches.

I followed the recipe except for using cream of tartar which I didn't have, but my cookies didn't spread at all.  I wonder if I mixed the batter too much or if the cream of tartar makes that much of a difference?  They were still yummy, but they weren't nice and pretty like the ones in the pictures.

Great recipe. If you live in Europe and don't have access to cream of tartar, use two teaspoons of baking powder to replace the baking soda and cream of tartar!

my first load in the oven, i cooked at 400 and they came out hard and puffy ugly. So, i turned the oven down to 350 and baked them for 8-9 minutes, and they came out perfect! very yummy! i'm still looking for the perfect snickerdoodle recipe though.

I followed the directions exactly and although the cookies had a good flavor, they were hard once they cooled off completely.  A few seconds in the microwave softens them up but they are not suitable to give away.

LOOK NO FURTHER!! I have tried over a dozen recipes for Snickerdoodles (including "Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles" from this site), and this one BEATS THEM ALL! I have finally found it!  I changed the sugar to cinnamon ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 (3 Tbs Sugar to 1.5 Tbs cinnamon). For me, too much cinnamon can easily overpower the fantastic flavor of the cookie. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. PERFECT! Thank you!

SUPERB COOKIE!! easy to make and they come out firm yet soft! The only thing I would change is add 2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1 tsp. Since the dough is really sticky and hard to form into balls,  I put the dough in the fridge, to let it firm up and perfect! Also you need to smash them down a little or else when they bake they do not flatten all the way.

this is a wonderful recipe...for those who arent sure, cream of tartar is not for flavor but works in combination to the baking soda to make the dough easier to handle...i did a little research, since i dont usually keep it in my pantry and found out that you can use 1 tsp of baking powder for every 1/4 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar...happy baking!!!

Finally, a snickerdoodle recipe without shortening. Yay! There were some comments about the 400 degree oven temp and then about the dough being so crumbly that it couldn't be rolled. One, set the oven at 375; 400 is too hot. And take the flour down to 2 1/2 cups rather than 2 3/4. Too much flour makes for a crumbly dough and dry cookie. And, lastly, if you like the cookie chewy, a good friend gave me a tip for cooling snickerdoodles. Let them rest on the cookie sheet, then let them cool completely on aluminum foil. Trust me, it works.

This is not your typical snickerdoodle because of its shape.  It does not flatten, which helps it to remain soft and chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

I have not made these cookies in a long time because I lost the recipe. My family really found them enjoyable, especially my husband. He has not had them in years. The cookies didn't even make it through the evening. Now he wants more. This time I will double the batch.

This is a very good cookie. It may need a little more salt to counterbalance its sweetness. It is definitely very easy.

I love this recipe! I actually added about 1/4 cup of cinnamon sugar to the dry ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon, it's so much easier.  I lightly coated my cookie sheet with non stick spray. I only baked them for 5-6 minutes at 400 degrees because they were so small. They didn't look all the way cooked at first but once they cooled they were delicious! Also, I mixed white sugar, cinnamon, and cinnamon sugar in a zip lock bag. Then I put several cookie balls in at a time and shook the bag to coat. This makes coating the cookies so much simpler. Enjoy!!

Very yum!  I changed it a bit, too.  Didn't have, so I didn't use any cream of tartar.  Used only 1 cup of sugar, but added 1 t of cinnamon to the batter.  Used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup unbleached white, and 1/4 cup each of wheat germ, ground flax seeds, and oat bran.  I like the consistency and my son declared them, "The best cookies EVER!"  Well, alrighty then;  They'll get into our regular rotation!

Super easy and great recipe! I have made these during the holidays the past two years.. The only trick to making these super fluffy and melt in your mouth status is to MAKE SURE YOUR SIFT ALL DRY INGREDIENTS prior to mixing! It's a bit more work but it makes ALL the difference. Received so many compliments! Thanks so much for the recipe Sue W!

Great recipe! I was happy to find a snickerdoodle recipe that uses butter instead of shortening. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out crisp on the outside and soft in the middle.  Not sure why some reviewers ended up with golf balls, mine spread out exactly the way I expected, no need to flatten before baking.  Thanks so much, my family loved them!

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookies, and these were everything they should be. Also, to those at high altitudes, they work perfectly- no changes needed! Trust me on this, I'm at 9200ft. :)

After reading some of the reviews, I reduced the flour to 2 cups. The dough wasn't too dry, but moist enough to form 1 inch balls. I used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 2 teaspoons for extra cinnamon flavor. I flattened them first and baked them at 375 degrees for 10 min. They came out great. I little bit crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. My son loves them.

These cookies are awesome! I even added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough itself, aside from rolling in the cinnamon sugar mixture. I guess everyone's oven is different but I baked these for 7 min. and they were perfect. Not even browned on the bottom yet - just right. I also just used my fingers to press down on the dough balls lightly to  encourage a nice flat round shape.

first run... not too bad. surprisingly enough, the sugar cookie part was not as sweet as i would like so i might add more sugar next time. and i kind of eye-balled the cinnamon-sugar coating to my taste. the first pan came out a bit too ball-shaped and not enough cookie-shaped, so i flattened the rest before baking and was happier with the look. good base recipe for snickerdoodles!

My husband has a vegan gluten-free diet.  I have been baking from non-vegan recipes, using substitutions for certain ingredients.  I used 1/2 each of white rice and brown rice flours instead of AP.  Instead of 2 eggs, I used 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin puree.  My husband must have gobbled down about six of them, once they cooled down.  He loved 'em!

One issue  that I did have was the instruction of not greasing the cookie sheets.  BIG MISTAKE!!  The cookies broke apart and they were crumbly.  Unfortunately, I had prepared two sheets like that.  I greased the other two with canola oil and it worked beautifully.  That would be the one thing I would have changed.  

I will definitely make them again.

I did not have cream of tartar on hand, but they still turned out great! I use stoneware to bake, and I did have to flatten them with a glass to have them cook correctly. Also gave them a light spray of vegetable oil to prevent them from sticking to the stone. Crispy on the outside with a chewy middle.

I absolutely love these cookies! I dropped the servings down to 12 (makes about 1 1/2 dozen), roll them into about 1 inch balls and bake at 400 degrees for 9 minutes. I've never made snickerdoodles prior to this recipe, but they bake intake delicious cookie balls that have a very slight crunch on the outside and a soft/doughy center (but not too doughy). I made them for a bake sale at work and received multiple compliments. Will definitely continue to bake these :o)

Perfect!  As an added bonus, these convert to gluten-free beautifully -- I simply subbed in tapioca and white rice flour in for the all purpose flour (45% tapioca, 55% rice), and used 2 tbs of gelatin to ensure they held together.  Beautiful cookies with a crisp outside and a soft, almost cakey interior.  Thanks for a winning recipe! :D

made these for the first time today with my daughters and neice, and we had such fun!! great recipe that's fun for kids to help with, especially rolling the dough balls in the cinn-sugar.  i really love how they turned out too--as it describes, they're a soft sugar cookie with the cinn-sugar topping, which is exactly what i like!  i am not a fan of the crispier versions of snickerdoodles on this site.  thanks for a wonderful recipe and and great afternoon together time for our family!

The kids loved them, but I'm not sure they turned out right.  They ended up being little hockey pucks after a day.  I will probably try it again just to figure out what went wrong.

This cookie is a wonderful recipe for snickerdoodles. I happened to make these for a party and everyone thought they were fantastic. I do have to say that I added a bit more sugar for the coating because the cinnamin tends to create a small bitter flavor for the first couple of seconds after you have bitten into the cookie. However the overall result is very tasty.

I love that this recipe doesn't require shortening, like most Snickerdoodle recipes do.
I followed the recipe exactly & had to make a second batch b/c they were so popular.
Yummmmy!

Fantastic!  Yummy!  Fast, easy, no special ingredients, and uses butter not shortening.  My 4 and 6 year old enjoyed making and eating these.

Very good cookies.  Delicious texture and taste.  Not too sweet, but just right.  I recommend taking them out when they still look a little gooey and taking them right off the cookie sheet.  Yum!    Be careful if you're recalculating this recipe using the "change the number of servings" feature- the recipe didn't recalculate correctly and I had to redo it myself anyway.

This recipe needs help. I'm not understanding why it has many good reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was way too dry. I ended up adding an extra 1/4c of butter and the dough came together better. The cookies looked good coming out of the oven but the texture is just too dry. Also, you need to press these cookies down otherwise they will remain in ball shape because they don't spread.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Fantastic! No cream of tartar; sub lemon juice. 8 minutes was perfect. I had no problem rolling them as is, my son used wet hands to roll his because it was easier for him, but his cookies came out slightly different because of the way the cinnamon sugar stuck to his. Don't make the balls too big, one inch was also perfect. Great recipe! thanks.

This was fabulous!  I baked exactly 8 minutes and promptly moved to a cooling rack.  Very tender inside with a crisp outer crust.  I only got 41, rather than 48, so next time I will make the balls slightly smaller.  I did make it a point to roll over and over in the cinnamon sugar coating, to the point of it seemingly penetrating the cookie.  This made a generous coating which was perfect!  Thank you for the recipe.

Perfectly soft on the inside with a little crunch around the outside.  Perfect snickerdoodle with about half the butter that is usually called for.  We al enjoyed these.

The second time I made these I used 1/2 margarine, 1/2 butter - butter tastes better, but has a crisper texture.  They maintain a softer texture with the margarine.   I also replaced 1/4C of sugar with a small package of instant vanilla pudding (single recipe) - the powdered milk and vanilla gives them a richer taste.  Very good!

I have always loved snickerdoodles, and these taste exactly like the ones I used to make as a kid.  This is a great recipe (no shortening!) and makes cookies that are slightly crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside.  A friend who told me she didn't like snickerdoodles changed her mind after eating these.  Thanks for the recipe, Sue!

These turnned out great!  I used the smaller 1" cookie scoop to measure the dough, rolled in cinnamon on all sides and lightly pressed down with bottom of a glass before baking.  Baked at 375 degrees for 9 minutes and them turnned out picture perfect!  Using the smaller scoop it make 43 cookies.Next time I might adding a little cinnamon to the batter of the cookie for a little extra flavor.

These turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used much more sugar and cinnamon to coat the rolled dough before putting them on the pan.  The dough was pretty sticky, but I just kept sprinkling the cinnamon/sugar mixture over my hands and the dough in the bowl and it worked out fine.  Soft, sweet, slightly tart Snickerdoodles!

These were okay but I probably would not make them again. They came out looking beautiful, but I wasn't very fond of their texture. They were soft and slightly chewy when right out of the oven, but after cooling they turned hard and crumbly. They also tasted quite dense and without much flavor (minus the sugar/cinnamon outside). They were a solid 'okay' but not worth repeating.

These are DELICIOUS!! The only thing I changed was that I added some cinnamon to the dough (and rolled in cinn./sugar). Baked for 9 minutes and they're perfect!! They didn't not really spread much, baked up nice and fluffy, but still some what chewy on the inside. The dough did seem a bit dry, but it was not a problem. Wonderful recipe!!

I made it without Cream of Tartar (couldn't find it) and it turned out delicious. I cooked it at 375 degrees instead of 400. Cookies ended up nice, soft, and chewy. Not too sweet either. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, was looking for one with butter because I was out of shortening.  I read one reviewer say the cream of tartar didn't matter.  I completely disagree, the cream of tartar gives the snickerdoodle it's classic taste, it has that sharp edge with all the sweetness.  Don't leave it out!

I don't know what went wrong...I followed the recipe exactly, and I checked the cookies after 8 mins in the oven, and they were still little balls with burnt bottoms.  I flattened them with my fork and put them back in for about 2 mins.  They taste fine, but are not pretty whatsoever.  
When I started rolling them, I was very surprised by the texture...very crumbly and dry, almost like a rough sand.  But, I have never made snickerdoodles before so I thought I'd go with it.  I had to press the balls together pretty hard to make them stay and roll them in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  
The only thing I can think that made this happen was that I used 2 medium eggs instead of large, so maybe not enough liquid?  Who knows.

The only thing I chaged was the bake temperature as others suggested since we like our Snickerdoodles chewy.  I baked them on 350 for about 12 minutes, and they are PERFECT!  I left them on the cookie sheet for about three minutes and put them straight on the rack to cool.  Awesome recipe!!!

Oh My God! These are the BEST snickerdoodles I have ever tasted, and I have tasted many, since snickerddodles are my favorite cookies. They come out of the oven with a beautiful cinnamon-sugar crust and are absolutely to die for fresh hot out of the oven. I made them for a friend as a birthday present, and they got rave reviews. Only thing i changed as to double the vanilla (always do) and cook for about 12-14 minutes at 375, not 400. THE BEST! thanks.

Three things I learned making these:

1. Using an electric mixer works really great because this dough comes out quite dense. It is really easy to roll out, but it is hard to stir.

2. These definitely maintain their shape so make sure you press them kind of flat or you will have very fat cookies!

3. The cookie mix comes out much better with a bit of added cinnamon! It just completes the recipe.

Overall these cookies were amazing! Don't  be worried about the density of the dough, they will bake wonderfully when pressed flat and they taste scrumptious!

Yum! I used Smart Balance butter and baked them on parchment paper at 375 for 8-9 minutes. I got about 85 cookies, so mine were on the smaller side - I think I will make them a bit bigger next time. 2 HELPFUL TIPS: 1 - spray hands with cooking spray before rolling dough, and 2 - keep the cookies in a container with a piece of white bread to keep them soft!

Super easy and delicious recipe! I made more of the cinnamon sugar mixture because I like my cookies sweet and cinnamon-y. Thanks to the cook who suggested using cooking spray on your hands to roll the dough and a zip loc baggie to coat the dough balls in cinnamon sugar. Made the process quick and easy. I lowered my temp to 375 degrees and baked for about 12-14 mins. Yum..chewy and thick!!

The cookies taste all right, but cooking them correctly is impossible. They do not cook thoroughly in the center, while burning on the bottom. Will not use this recipe again.

I rated this a 4 only because snickerdoodles aren't my favorite cookie, but these are great as far as snickerdoodles go!  I made them at the request of a friend,  chose this recipe because it had less overall fat (no shortening), and followed the recipe exactly.  The dough is stiff and it takes awhile to incorporate all the dry ingredients.  The cookies, however, are soft and chewy with a sugary crunch on the outside.  My only "problem" was getting the sugar half of the cinnamon-sugar to stick to the non-sticky dough balls.  Not a problem, but wetting your hands before forming the cookies might help the sugar   stick better.

They were very good! After rolling the dough i got it wet and then rolled it so the sugar and cinnamon would stick on it better. It worked great!

I really don't know why people say they do not like this recipe. I think it was easy to make and the cookies tasted wonderful. Actually I make them and have to hide them from my husband or he eats them all in one sitting. People at work beg me to make more!!!

BEST. SNICKERDOODLES. EVER.

I have always loved snickerdoodles, but I will never think of my old recipe the same way after trying this. A word of caution - these are really easy to overbake, so be careful! Over all, this was a fantastic recipe, though!!!

Turn oven down to 375, shorten cooking time, and press balls.
This was a great recipe. I doubled it and made 1/2 inch for a bake sale made about 125 cookies. They do not spread at all so be sure to push them down, but you can pack your tray. I baked them at 375 in convection for about 6 minutes turning once for even exposure to the fan.

Taste and texture good. Substituted some lemon juice for tartar (much better sub than vinegar). Dough was somewhat on the dry side, to the point that the sugar cinnamon mixture didn't stick all that well.Definitely want to keep the dough balls smaller and pre-flatten them as these will not flatten much as they bake.

I made these cookies and left them in the oven for 8 mins. When i went to check on the them, there was an odd scent that filled my home sweet home and they smelt burnt! I checked on them and the oven was full of smoke and the cookie bottoms were burnt! Now you see, i am a good baker and this never happen to me. Thumbs down!

I don't even like snicker doodles  but this recipe was fool proof and the cookies are picture perfect.  Chewy, not crunchy.   One problem I had was the cinnamon.   I have noticed lately that cinnamon is flavorless and this bottle of mccormicks 'gourmet' ground Saigon cinnamon is as tasteless as there is.   Does anyone know what happened to cinnamon?   Where did all the flavor go?

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. It was my first time making snickerdoodles and they came out perfectly! Tip: If your cookies are too soft when they're right out of the oven, just let them cool until they are crisp on the outside and chewy/soft on the inside. Also, if you don't have cream of tartar, you can just take it out or replace it with lemon juice (but double the amount of lemon juice). The lemon juice doesn't make the cookies sour by the way :) These cookies are delicious and they were super easy to make!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if this is just different than I'm used to but mine stayed in little balls. I'm used to them flattening and softening and getting nice and crackly looking. I chose this one because I didn't have more than 1/2 cup of butter and no shortening. Oh well, could have very well been my fault but I will go back to my usual.

I've been using this recipe for 2+ years, and it's perfect.  The only adjustment I make is to bake them at 390 for 8-10 min...and sometimes I have to make a little extra of the sugar/cinnamon dipping mix.  That's it.  This is consistently the best Snickerdoodle recipe around.  I highly recommend it!

These cookies are wonderful! Soft and moist. The snickerdoodles recipe I usually make requires shortening and I was out. I use a tablespoon and drop it in the sugar/cinnamon and then roll them since the dough is a little sticky.  This will be my new go to recipe.

Oh man. This is now forever my go-to snickerdoodle recipe. I love this one. If you are generous on your sugar/cin coating then you do not need a sweeter dough for the cookie. The cookie itself is not too-sweet so that you can appreciate the coating with just the right amount of cooking - gets just the right amount of crispy. I only had a tiny bit of butter and was searching for a recipe that would yield me a good amount of cookies for such little butter. THIS IS IT! I yielded 36 cookies, though. NOT 48 as the recipe says. However, when I checked out the ingredients and saw the flour amount - I knew the 48 cookies were going to be hard to squeeze. I COULD have squeezed them if I made tiny cookies but...why? 36 good-sized is great for me. I already packed my containers to give these away for Christmas.

I think the cookies have an overall good taste. But 400F was way to hot for the cookies. They should be baked lower. My oven was set to 400 and only in the oven for 8 minutes before the bottom burnt. Good thing I wasn't making these for anything special!

I picked this recipe out of the multiple snickerdoodle recipes on this site, because it contains all butter, and I can't stand vegetable shortening in cookies (even though I know it provides textural benefits and so forth, it's the principal of not using trans fats).  Anyway, I made this recipe exactly as written, except followed one reviewer's suggestion of flattening the balls slightly before baking, and they came out perfectly.  Just as good or better than any I've had from a bakery!  In fact, the kids and I just polished off the rest of them for breakfast...(ooh, bad mom!)  But they are so good, and not overly sweet.  Great recipe!

I've made these twice now and my entire family loves them. My daughter requested them for her 12th birthday (we aren't cake people in this house, so we put a candle in whatever dessert we choose!). Mine turn out big and puffy every time. I use a 1" scoop for ALL my cookies, works wonderfully. Thanks!

These cookies turned out perfectly.  Crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I was proud to share them with family and friends!

This is a good recipe - and the cookies taste the same as the ones I have had as a kid. Just a couple of things - you must flatten these. I used the bottom of a small glass. The dough tastes spectacular - quite unusual with snickerdoodles. I had to add more cinnamon and sugar. 2 teaspoons weren't enough. The temp was fine for me at 11 minutes.

Not a good recipe I'm afraid.  Cookies are dry and I can't serve these with my other cookies for Christmas Day.  Upon researching other recipes, every ingredient is the same except they use double the butter or 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup shortening.  Very disappointed.

very good cookie but turn oven down to 375 or slightly press down the dough before you bake to get a even cookie

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect!  They were a little soft in the middle when I took them out of the oven so I left them on the hot pan until it cooled and they finished cooking.  Mine and my hubbies new favorite cookie! Great job Sue!

The recipe is delicious, but (maybe because I used cold butter) I had to add a little extra butter, the dough wouldn't form, because it was to dry. 8 minutes for small cookies was right on the money tho! Love them!

These cookies are a huge disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly and they're just not any good. They don't spread out like cookies but stay in mounds, they're hard, and they taste like bread rolled in cinnamon sugar. Not even good bread, either. Lame, chewy, tasteless bread. I am so depressed because I am sitting here looking at a pile of cookies that I am not going to eat.

This is a super delicious cookie. Guaranteed success if you follow the recipe as is. :) I made it ahead of time for a bake sale. My dad loved them so much he gave me $5 for 5 of these. I think I am going to only sell them $0.75 each.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for - soft in the middle and slightly crispy on the outside.  I always make a recipe as written the first time and modify later.  However, I did add some freshly grated nutmeg to the batter and would do it again.

This recipe does not disappoint..This is exactly what I  have been looking for,  for a long time.  It is soft in the middle with a little crunch to the outside..I had to readjust the baking time for my oven to 11 minutes and the recipe is very easy..This recipe will go in my book to teach to my 6 granddaughters. Thank You Sue.

I added more butter  - and they came out perfect.  They even managed to stay a bit more soft than the usual shortening called for recipes.

This cookies are easy and delicious!  I needed to find an easy recipe to keep my four year old son occupied this rainy afternoon and he loved rolling the little cookie balls and swishing them around in the cinnamon-sugar.  Will definately make again!

Best snickerdoodle cookie I've ever made!  I make these cookies all the time for friends and family and everyone always loves them!  I like to use a miniature ice cream scooper to form the cookies (it's much easier to roll them in the cinnamon/sugar mixture).  Can't wait to make these again!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I absolutely love these. The first time I made them they were gone the next day. I made another batch and they were gone that day. I omitted the cream of tartar because we couldn't find ours and I baked the cookies at between 375 and 400 degrees. Just as another reviewer said, these are harder on the outside but sooo moist and yummy on the inside, even a day later! I will definitely be making these again.

I made these as an experiment using whole wheat flour. They were a bit grittier, of course, due to the texture of the wheat flour, but the flavor was perfect, as was the texture. They were soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. Took them to a picnic and they were gone instantly.

I know a bit about making and eating cookies, and these cookies are DELICIOUS!!! They are soft and chewy, not too sweet. However, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. Word of warning: depending on your oven you may need to adjust your time in the oven. I left mine in for 8 mins and they burnt the bottoms around 7. Other than that these cookies are a new favorite

Dough will appear a bit crumbly (at least for my cookies), but I followed the instructions (9 min @ 400 degrees) and they turned out perfect and the flavor on these is great. Now the real test is how well they freeze and defrost.

Not at all like what I was expecting.  Too dry.  Don't spread out, just stay in mounds.  Needs more butter.

These are amazing cookies! I made them just as the directions said, except I omitted the cream of tartar because I didn't have any. They were amazing- moist, super delicious cookies- that I will be making again and again and again! I'm not a snickerdoodle lover, I made them for my boyfriend- but these were absolutley great!

I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour.  I also lowered the oven temp to 375 for about 10 minutes in the oven.  Tasty cookie.

I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the sugar back by about 1/4 cup. The dough and final product was dry :-/ I will still eat them but will continue to search for the perfect snickerdoodle

I'm not sure if the problem was me or the recipe. I tried making these with Splenda. I used Splenda in the dough and regular sugar in the topping because it has a very different texture obviously. With the 24 serving recipe mine only yielded 15 cookies. I didn't measure, but they must have been bigger than 1 inch. The taste is great, however my cookies (with the Splenda) did not spread at all - they just cracked a little. At about 10 minutes on 400 degrees they cooked all the way through. I'll have to try it again with regular sugar and smaller to see if that's the difference. Thanks for sharing all the same.

I'm sad to say I had the same problems as others - the cookies didn't spread so no cracks and even with close watching, turned out hard. Also, the 2tbs sugar to 2tsp cinnamon wasn't enough cinnamon. I ended up with biscotti like pucks. That said, I'm still eating them (shrug).  I've found my Mom's recipe and it calls for twice the cream of tartar, crisco & a 1-to-1 ratio of cinnamon/sugar, so back to the source.

This recipe is wonderful! The only thing I changes was to flatten them a bit with the back of a spoon about 3 minutes before they were done cooking. Great recipe!

Perfection.  These are my new go-to snickerdoodle recipe.  For those who didn't have them turn out - perhaps you made an error in preparing?  Because these are the perfect flavor, texture, everything.  And easy and fast to whip up!  Thanks for sharing!!

Perfection! This is my first time making snickerdoodles, and these came out perfectly! I made them rather small and baked for 8 min on 375. Didn't bother with the cream of tartar. Definitely give these a try!

Baker beware! This is  a good recipe, but I suggest that you must add 1 more cup softened butter to bring it to the correct consistency before baking!!!! Otherwise, too dry!!!!

The snickerdoodles fans in my family LOVE these cookies.  I, being a snicerdoodles virgin,  found their taste to be far too subtle to be interesting to me.   I followed some reviewer suggestions - lightly flattening the dough with a juice glass before baking, baking for 8 min 15 seconds, room temp butter & eggs.  Thx for posting!

We love these. I really like that the amount of butter is less than other snickerdoodle recipes. I would suggest flattening them a bit before baking, but other than that these are some of the best I've had.

The dough was really hard to get into balls for me, it wasn't quite sticky enough, so I added a little water.  They didn't taste quite right to me; they were still good, but not really my thing.

I made these about 2 hours ago and WOW are they delicious! I tweaked the recipe a bit by putting the oven at 375.  I also put 1 tsp of cinnamon in the dry ingredient mix. Also, I didn't add cream of tartar. I baked them for exactly 8 minutes, no more no less! They came out soft and big and extremely delicious! The 2 tbsp sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon are not enought for the cookies to be rolled in though, so we had to keep adding. Defintely the best snickerdoodle recipe!

I am a big fan of snickerdoodles, but this recipe is not a keeper. I will not be using this recipe again. My cookies came out a little too dry. I think the oven temperature needs to be turned down to 375. They also didn't spread out and stayed in mounds. I  also reduce the sugar from 1 1/2 cup to 1 cup. The cookies were just okay nothing special.

this is a super easy and great tasting recipe-I do agree to cut back temperature - 400 degrees is a bit too hot. i didn't have cream of tartar so I just increased the baking soda to 1 tsp and it was great!!!

I chose this recipe because I prefer butter to shortening.  These cookies are delicious!  I didn't change a thing.  I did double the recipe and my family would not stop eating the dough while I was trying to make the cookies.  The dough was very good too.  I think something about the cream of tartar makes it really good.  I would suggest making sure the balls of dough that you roll up are no bigger than one inch and only leave them in the oven for 10 minutes, as the recipe states.  I left one pan in for 12 minutes and they are too crunchy.

These were ok. I wouldn't send a basket of them to anyone though. Also, they had a weird after taste, as if used a sugar subsitute in the recipe. I did not, and I can't imagine any other reason for this except the cream of tartar the recipe calls for. I think I'll just use the basic sugar cookie recipe and just add the cinnamon and sugar.

This was a great recipe.  My mother in law forgot to bring her recipe this year so we tried this one and they came out soooo good.  I was never a snickerdoodle fan until these.  We baked them at 375 and also the cinnamon sugar ratio we altered a bit to have less cinnamon to sugar than called for.  So yummy!

This was a good recipe, however my dough was too runny to roll balls right away and I had to put the dough in the fridge for a few hours. After that they turned out good.

I am a huge fan of baking and loved snickerdoodles when I was a kid.  I looked up this recipe rather than bothering my mom for her recipe, and my fiance and I were NOT impressed!  The cookie dough was so sticky we had to wash our hands after "making" each ball of dough.  The cookies were very puffy when baked, and they were extremely blan with the exception of the cinnamon sugar coating.  I actually joked I could have taken tube biscuits from the store, rolled them in cinnamon sugar, and that would have tasted better.  Got mom's recipe the next day!

Great recipe! The cookies texture is amazing. I substituted 1/4 cup of the butter for unsweetened apple sauce - I was a little nervous this would maybe ruin the recipe but it turned out awesome and a nice hit of apple. I followed the suggestions that mamasanjrc made about turning down the oven to 375 and it worked out great.

First time making these and they came out great, did not have cream of tarter but read you can sub. it with baking powder just used the same amount baking powder of what cream of tarter should have been. Some of the cookies I baked to long and they got very crunchy so I just put a cloth over them and in the morning they were soft.

Just made these cookies today with my 5 year old daughter and we had the BEST time and the cookies came out delicious!!!!  We had a little trouble with the dough sticking to our hands when rolling into balls but found a quick remedy dipping our hands in a little flour then rolling.  These are the first batch of cookies my daughter has helped the entire time with and she announced today that she wants to be a professional baker when she grows up!  Preciouis!!

I couldn't find my mom's recipe so I was excited when I found this one.  I followed the directions exactly while following some of the suggestions from other people. I baked them at 375 degrees instead of 400, and found they taste great with or without the cream of tartar.  However, so that the bottoms of my cookies didn't burn, I ended up taking the cookies out after about 7 minutes and 30 seconds.  They were chewy, wonderful and my friends loved them.

Too much flour and sugar. We only used a little over 2 cups of flour and a cup of white sugar, and about an 8th to a 4th of a cup of brown sugar. We added cinnamon to the batter and some brown sugar to the topping. They came out deliciously and they look really pretty.

Absolutely perfect... I took others' advice and turned the oven down to 375 and rolled small 1" balls.  The cookies are small but very fluffy, crisp outside with soft middle.  Amazing.

Like other reviewers, I was looking for a recipe without shortening as I didn't have any on hand. Followed the recipe exactly how it was written and the cookie was perfect. With my oven, I have to leave the cookies for 8 minutes. My first batch was 10 mins. and they turned a little hard after cooling.

These were very good! I first creamed the butter and sugar with my beater, and then added the egg and vanilla. They turned out to be little puffballs of cookies, not flat at all (which I liked, but it meant they had to bake a little longer to bake the top up). I had to mess around with the oven temp a little, 400 is too high. I also cut down on the sugar by about half.

We Loved these cookies. I've Finally found the best snickerdoodle recipe ever. I only make cookies with REAL butter and it's hard to find a snickerdoodle recipe that uses butter. The only thing I would suggest is to slightly flatten the cookies before baking.  You won't be disappointed I give it a 10. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this recipe four or five times now, and every time the cookies are amazingly cute and perfect-looking. I really like the rounded, dome-like shape of the cookies and the way they're just a little fluffy, but I can see how that may be a turnoff for some bakers/tasters.

Word of advice though: be very careful with how long you put it in for! The recipe's recommendation of 8-10 minutes is right on, but any longer than that and you will have sad and burned cookies.

Very yummy!  I made several batches and used prior suggestions so that by the final batches I felt I had the perfect cookie.  I flattened the cookies just a bit with a spatula (this made for a much more presentable cookie) and reduced temp to 375 at 9 minutes.  I also tried both rolling the entire cookie in the sugar mixture as well as only the top of it and by far I felt that rolling the entire cookie was much better. I also used parchment paper on all batches and was very pleased with the end result.  Thanks for all the suggestions!

These are so easy to make! I love snickerdoodles but find them overly sweet sometimes. These cookies were just right...chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside and just the right amount of sweetness. I omitted the cream of tartar, lowered the oven temp and baked(10 mins) on an insulated cookie sheet. They came out perfect! Even tasted great the next day!

These cookies were very good. The only thing is that my first batch didn't spread very well and were very puffy and thick. On the second batch, I remedied this by just flattening them slighty with the back of a spatula before putting them in the oven. The flavor is very good more like a sugar cookie than a snickerdoodle. I will definitely add cinnamon to the batter next time to get more of a snickerdoodle taste. The consistency of the cookie is a little crispy on the outside and rather thick and cake-like in the middle. Overall a great cookie.

With such great reviews I tried this recipe.  It did not turn out like any Snickerdoodle I have ever eaten.  The dough was dry, the outside of the cookie when baked was hard as rock, and the inside was doughy and tastless.

Perfect and super easy. I cooked them at 375 for 9 minutes. I made them Wednesday, it's now Saturday and they're still soft, even after sitting out on the table for 3 days.

I was going to London (I live in Cleveland) and was invited to a flat-warming party, so I figured since these were so soft for a week after I made them last time that they would hold up over the trans-atlantic flight, and they did so well. Everyone at the party went crazy for these cookies, and when they thought I was going to take the cookies (I was taking the container, left the cookies), I feared for my life. These were a HUGE hit!! Highly highly highly recommended.

Before I begin my review, I'm basing this on what others have said since I did not taste these!

Everyone LOVED them, but everyone said they needed a more cinnamon flavor. That may have something to do with the fact I ran out of cinnamon and used Pumpkin Pie Spice? Besides that, I took them to my class I teach at church [12/13 year old girls] and received a couple of "I love yous." 

They did come out beautiful, so in appearance alone I give 5 stars, but all together I'm giving them a 4!

These are great! Soft and chewy.  I baked them at 375 like others suggested and left out the vanilla because I didn't have any on hand.

Tasted delicious, but came out more like biscotti.
I followed the recipe exactly and even turned down the oven temperature but after about 10 minutes, they hardened to the point that they need to be dunked into coffee or cider to make them softer. Not sure what I did wrong.

I love when recipes remind me of my grandmother. She was an awesome cook & I always wanted her to make me snickerdoodles. These tasted just like hers. Make sure you don't overcook them - some of mine were too crispy. Thanks!

I lover snickerdoodles, but hate shortening, so I tried these because they use butter.  They tasted great and were fluffy when cooked, not flat.  Perfect.

PERFECTION! I decided on this recipe because I did not have any shortening and prefer butter. I am so happy with it! I have a basic gas stove and normally have A LOT of trouble w/cookies. It seems they always burn on the bottom and don't cook on top. I cooked these on 350 for 8 minutes and they came out EXCELLENT! I always made these as a kid so it brought me back. I think this is a better recipe then I used to use. My husband had never even heard of snickerdoodles and now he keeps telling me.. I LIKE THOSE SNICKERDOODLES!
Thanks for the great recipe :)

I made these cookies with Splenda for my diabetic friend, and they turned out amazing.  Just subsitute granulated Splenda for the white sugar in the same amounts, then cook at 375 for about 8 minutes.  I was pleasently shocked by how good they were.

These were good but I did make a few adjustments. I used a whole cup of butter and I used half the amount of cream of tartar (too salty) and I added a little milk...maybe 2 tablespoons. Since these cookies retain their shape I pressed them down a little after balling and rolling in sugar mixture.....very chewy and soft! My husband loved them and hes not one for sugar cookies!

This is the best Snickerdoodle recipe I have come across. The outside was crisp and the inside stayed soft for the two days that they lasted. I think this is the perfect Snickerdoodle!

Very good, but after baking the first dozen I realized they weren't as sweet as they should be.  After I put the second dozen on the cookie sheet, I sprinkled with more sugar and they turned out just right!
Also, the tip from another member to spray cooking oil onto my hands when rolling the dough into balls helped a lot!

The results were exactly what I was looking for! The cookies were crisp on the edges, and chewy in the middle. I especially liked the fact that they're made without shortening. I had to adjust the cooking time to 375F to suit my oven. To prevent the dough from sticking to your hands, lightly apply cooking oil spray to your palms.

I was not at all impressed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies came out tough and chewy.  I've been making cookies for years, and have never had any recipe turn out this hard and chewy.  I'm not sure what happened.

There is neither enough baking soda nor cream of tarter in this recipe.  Those not only leaven the recipe, they provide the distinctive taste of the snickerdoodle.  If want a cookie that is perhaps a little less tart than a snickerdoodle, this may be the recipe for you.  If you want a real snickerdoodle, look elsewhere.

These cookies were delicious; flavorful but not at all too sweet. It is missing 1 star only because I had a problem with the size of the cookies which is most likely my fault. I only got about 18 cookies as opposed to 24. Due to the thickness, they were slightly undercooked in the centers. I will definitely try these again and experiment with the sizes. To reduce fat and calories, use light butter and sugar substitite. Work just as well!

My first batch turned out burnt on the bottoms yet uncooked in the center; for the second batch, I flattened the balls of dough with a fork and they turned out a little better, but not much.

These came out perfect! I added a touch of cinnamon to the batter and they are absolutely perfect. The batter was not at all runny or too sticky for rolling, I was party afraid it was too dry. They came out wonderful!

Definetly turned out yummy! Everyone enjoyed them. I only had one problem, they got done on one side before the other, so they would be a bit burnt. I think it is more due to my oven than anything else! But I did find that if you kind of spead the dough out just a bit thiner they baked fine! So for those of you that have ovens that run a but hotter than normal...try flattening them out a bit. Another thing was I found the dough a bit hard to ROLL in the cinnamon-sugar so i just sprinkled it on top instead...worked fine!

They're good, but there was too much disagreement in the reviews regarding the temp and how long to bake them. So my first batch came out hard as a rock. I think that was at 390 for 10 minutes.  I lowered the temp to about 375 as I recall and only baked them about 8 minutes.  The rest came out crispy outside and nice and chewy on the inside. I used my small cookie scoop and mashed them down just a little before baking.

This recipe is not sweet enough for me.  Like someone else said, you have to press them down almost flat so they cook evenly.

I followed other suggestions and increased the butter to 3/4 cup. I also doubled the vanilla.  My daughter put the sugar and cinnamon in the mix, so we did some on the outside too.  I doubled the whole batch.  It was very good.

I read a lot of comments both before and after I made these (yesterday) and I have come to the conclusion that not many other people figured out that there’s just too much frickin’ flour—2-3/4 cups is overkill. And that’s why the dryness and “failure to spread” of the individual cookies in the oven. I added 2 cups of flour and think it would be even better with a little less than that. The flavor of these cookies is superb, and my batch with 3/4 cup less flour was very good, but I’m going to make them with 9-year-old and 7-year-old boys on Thursday so I’ll see if (1) they’re better with less flour than 2 cups,  and (2) are they good to make with kids. If it seems worthwhile, I’ll post the answers.

This is a very sweet cookie. I made this recipe using 1 c butter flavor.shortening instead of the butter and only baked them for 9 minutes.  They ended up softer,  just the way my husband likes them.

Like I said, these are very sweet with all the sugar in them.  I might reduce the amount in the cookies next time.

This is a very dry dough.  I even double checked to make sure I used enough butter.  The balls did not flatten much with baking.  The cookie is soft but dry and not much taste.  If you like chewy Snickerdoodles this is not the recipe for you.

Cookies were moist and the taste was great. I like using butter instead of shortening. Definitely gave it a wonderful flavor. I wasn't able to take a picture, they were gobbled up so fast. Will definitely be my go to snickerdoodle recipe.

Delicious snickerdoodle cookies. The only thing I changed was I baked them at 375 for 10 min and used a small cookie scooper. Thanks for the recipe.

I made it like the recipe but added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. I balled then flattened and covered one side with the cinnamon/sugar mix. This made 24 cookies for me. I also left out the cream of tartar because I didn’t have it. I know it helps with texture, but the texture was perfect without it. Also a note, it took 7 minutes to bake these in a gas oven. VERY easy to burn.

Amazing flavor and so good. I followed recipe to a T. I love them but kind of expected them to flatten out more. Are they suppose to be more round and puffy then flat? If so please tell me how. I will definitely make these again

I made these tonight exactly as stated. The size of the cookie was a little larger and therefore the middle wasn’t fully cooked. So I Iowered the temp to 375 and made the cookies a little smaller. For the 2nd batch. These turned out much better. These are a classic snickerdoodle. Great taste. Just need cookies to be a little smaller and at a lower temp (375) to get them to cook evenly. Will make again.

So good! Everyone said they were AMAZING. I made large scoops so they were nice and big. This was the first recipe I could find that didn’t use shortening, which I didn’t have on hand, so it was perfect. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Too dense/dry..
baked the first batch in balls like in the directions...they barely flattened out! Turned down the heat to  390°, flattened out with a fork, ended up a bit better. But still dry.  I wont make this recipe again.

I can't tell you how many batches of these I've made over the years.  As per other reviewers, yes, the butter is very soft, and I drop the temp to 375 degrees for 10 minutes.  They come out wonderful and the house smells terrific!

i tried baking these on non-greased cookie sheets at 390 for 8 minutes and the cookie was raw-i upped it to 10 min and it burnt. Not sure what I did wrong but half of my cookies didn't come out too great. I will prob try again bc it seems like many people like these. I use a cookie scoop so I know they were all the same size.

Delicious!  10 minutes is all they need.  They came out light and fluffy.  The eggs and butter wet not at room temperature either.  I made one batch that required two cookie pans.  The first pan I did not spray the pan and the second one I used crisco shortening.  It didn’t matter.  They slipped off the pan both ways.  Simple recipe, simple ingredients.  The one thing I wasn’t sure about was whether to flatten the cookies before I put them in the oven.  I searched and found a website where they did not flatten them, so I didn’t and they came out delicious.  I’ll make these again. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious classic snickerdoodle. Nicely puffed, soft in the middle with a beautiful crisp cracked exterior. I had to cook mine for 12 min as my oven may be a bit slow.

For the amount of stars and the pictures that this recipe has with it, the butter must need to be very soft. I made these in the winter so even though my butter was “room temperature”, it didn’t whip very well. I knew it wasn’t great when the dough didn’t want to come together. My first dozen cookies came out as sad little mounds, so the second dozen I shaped more into discs and lowered the oven to 375. That helped salvage them, but they still didn’t flatten enough for the classic snickerdoodle. I think the fat content in these needs to be doubled, either with another half cap of butter or a half cup of shortening. The flavor is great for snickerdoodles, and it’s a nice fluffy recipe, it just didn’t flatten enough to feel like a true cookie /:

I used self rising flour so I left out the baking soda and salt.  These are my favorite cookies!  Easy or I would not make them. I used a small cookie scoop so they would all be the same size, making  35 generous sized cookies. I hate making cookies but will make these because they are so worth it. Addictive.

So I don’t know what I did wrong but the dough was crumbling. I checked the recipe and I didn’t mess up on ingredients. I made balls as best I could with crumbled dough. I had to flatten halfway through baking. End product was disappointing.

I made these for the first time last night.  I used 1/2 butter and no shortening  and used baking powder/soda mix instead of cream of tarter.  I increased the vanilla to 2 Tbsp. and the flour to an even 3 cups.  The roll mixture I used was 3 Tbsp. sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ginger and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Drop the temp to 375 for 9 minutes.  I love the puffiness and texture!  Very eye pleasing and tasted great!

I dont think I will make this recipe again. For one, when you follow the recipe, it makes crumbly dough (which tastes just fine). I added another egg and a splash more vanilla and the dough is perfect!

I used half butter, half regular Crisco and took them out of the oven after exactly 8 minutes. They turned out perfect: a bit of crunch on the outside but chewy in the center, and not flat!

Snickerdoodles are a family favorite for us and this was a perfect replacement for our misplaced recipe! I recommend combining the sugar and butter first, then adding the eggs and vanilla (which is a perfect recipe addition by the way) and also baking at slightly below 400 degrees. Other than that, I had none of the other problems that I’ve seen others say they had with the recipe. I left my dough in a ball and they spread perfectly. They were firm on the outside and soft on the inside, just the way my family likes them!

I had to add a considerable amount of cinnamon. The recipe, (as written), turned out less like a snickerdoodle and more like a sugar cookie.

Great cookies! We ended up cooking them for longer so that they were crispy. Total cook time was about 20 minutes!

These cookies are soft and chewy with that sugary cinnamony goodness that only snickerdoodles have. My only negative comment would be that the cinnamon flavor was a little overpowering- maybe cut it back to one teaspoon. Otherwise, very yummy!

If you look at any other snickerdoodle recipe the first thing you should notice is that this recipe uses 1/2 the fat it should (some reviewers praise that fact). What you end up making are snickerscones, not cookies. I doubled the butter to salvage this and I think that if you do that this recipe is passable.  To some of the positive reviewers who are blaming ovens or ingredients, I’d be really curious how you managed to to use this recipe successfully without modification, because the chemistry just doesn’t work.

I had to add a little bit of water to the dough because it was a tad too dry. I baked the cookies at 390 for 10 minutes. Excellent recipe!

Perfect recipe. I took a reviewers advice and kept my cookies small and they had soft centers and a perfect chewy bite. Other all-butter snickerdoodle recipes tend to turn out flat.

I've always thought my oven was slow but not today.  The first ones got overcooked on the bottom.  I cut the temp back to 375, and they are very, very nice.

This recipe was very delicious.  It tasted like a normal sugar cookie rolled in cinnamon and sugar!  Very well balanced and was a big hit with friends and family.  !  The dough was really easy to roll out and not sticky or dry, so they worked out really well, and weren't a big mess to clean up!   I baked them in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes and they turned out awesome!  Would defiantly make them again!

Super tasty! Love these for something simple and quick. Also like it because it doesn't use shortening like most recipes. Though some people have complained, I personally love the soft, fluffy center. Melts in your mouth!

My girls and I were making these and when we were all done mixing the dough it was so dry that it wouldnt roll into balls.  It was a crumbly mess. I looked a a few other recipes that called for double the butter. I melted 2 more sticks and added it to the dough. It was MUCH better.

It asked for way too much dry mix. I had to add water because I wasn't prepared to have a bowl of powder. It also took much more than 8-10 minutes to bake. I'm very frustrated with this recipe.

Snickerdoodles are a family favorite, they love moist cookies. I found this recipe and it turned out well. I did add a small amount of milk to the batter because it was a little dry, but the cookies turned out great.

The overall flavor of the cookie was good. I baked in a 375 degree oven.  9 minutes was perfect, soft and chewy! 10 minutes gave them a slight crunch on the edge, but soft in the middle. Rolled a bit smaller than 1" and pressed slightly to flatten before baking.

I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I set the oven temp to 375 degrees instead of 400 (I have never seen a cookie recipe with a baking temp higher than 375), and I made sure to chill the dough before rolling into balls and baking. They turned out great! Do make sure to spread the balls out on the cookie sheet because these spread quite a bit when baking and to not make the balls too big.

I have been baking snickerdoodles for 15 years with large groups of students as well as my grandchildren and tried many recipes. This is the best, easiest, and fastest I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I did differently was to gently press down on the cookies with my fingers before baking as one of the reviews said they did not spread out.  They baked up large and beautiful and looked and smelled heavenly.  This is now the only snickerdoodle recipe I will ever use.

These cookies looked PERFECT when they came out of the oven!  They also tasted really good! But I will admit that the insides were a bit too doughy (I put them in for 9 minutes.) I'd make these again, but I'd recommend putting them in for more than 8-10 minutes.

Disappointed. Not a great Snickerdoodles recipe. I used this recipe because it only required butter and no shortening (I was all out of shortening).  Next time I will use a recipe that calls for shortening or a combination of shortening and butter. The cookies did not spread and stayed in little mounds, tended to be dry, and the flavor was not that great.

I loved these.  The kids them gone in minutes.  I did flatten the balls slightly  with a glass, as per other reviewers.  I especially liked that they didn't have to be chilled and yet the dough was super easy to handle.

Turned out absocinnamonlutely delicious! I added a few dashes of cinnamon  to the sugar and egg mixture. I also wrapped the dough in wax paper and put it in the refrigerator for a half hour before baking. And I don't believe in ungreased cookie sheets or removing cookies immediately.

I made this exactly according to recipe. This recipe was tasty and the cookies came out crispy but I personally prefer a bit more butter in my snickerdoodles… They came out a bit too hard for my liking. I like the cookies to be soft in the middle however these were great for dipping into milk or coffee. I will use the recipe again but add a little more butter next time or cut down on the flour.

I've made many batches of snickerdoodles over the years, some good, some not so much but these are going into my recipe book for sure! Not your typical snickerdoodle, these turned out as mounds. Very light, tender and slightly chewy. 

For me the recipe made 24, 1.5 inch wide cookies. At 400° for 12 to 14 minutes or until light golden brown on the bottom and slightly cracked on the top.

I tinkered with this recipe the tiniest bit. Added a 1/4 t of almond extract.  Also added a pinch of clove to the sugar cinnamon coating.  They were buttery, and fluffy with a pleasing crunch imparted by the sugar on the surface. This recipe is a keeper.

I made these as the recipe says.  Did not turn out.  They are very dry and hard to roll into a ball.         I checked another recipe that my sister had.  It called for 1 cup butter instead of 1/2 c. butter.  2 teaspoons cream of tarter in place of 1 tsp.  And 1 tsp. baking soda in place of 1/2 tsp. I made these cookies with this adjustment and they turned out really good.  Thanks for listening.  Have a good day!!!

I think that these are good and easy but I prefer them with 2 sticks of butter vs. just 1.
My family loves them (especially the dough!)

I thought they were very good but I am not an expert since I prefer chocolate.
My family liked them a lot.  I baked them at 375F for 9 min which made them crispy, then
switched to 400F for 8 min which kept them softer in the middle. Either way I will def make
them again.

This is my go to cookie recipe. The 4 stars rather than 5 are simply because I do alter it slightly. I use 1/2 tsp of baking powder rather than soda and cream of tartar (which I rarely have in the house). And because I live at altitude I add 2 tbsp of acidic liquid such as greek yogurt or mayonnaise. Some reviews have mentioned them not turning out like "usual" snickerdoodles. In my opinion this is a great thing. They are soft and chewy, rather than crispy, which I love. I get rave reviews from everyone who tries them. Don't let the negative reviews deter you - try this recipe! Especially if you live at altitude and have problems with dry, hard cookies.

I reduced the oven temperature by 10 degrees and had to bake these for 16 minutes- and they still did not come out right it seems. They stayed in little balls, and even pressing down on them with a glass didn't make them spread hardly at all. They taste okay, but they aren't the big, fluffy snickerdoodles I'm used to.

Used 0.5 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of white. Set over at 380 degrees for 9 mins. Need to make them small, about 1inch, and press down with two fingers. Tasted great!

These turned out very good.  I used 3 cups flour, though.  Think it made them a little less likely to fall in the middle and turn out flat.  Very good cookies.

The cookies look great, and they taste okay. I have had much better snickerdoodles for sure. I think there is too much cream of tartar in this recipe for one thing. It leaves an odd aftertaste that I don't like. There also seems to be something missing here. I haven;t figured out what it is yet, but the cookies are just a bit too bland.

These are pretty bland. I had high hopes, since I am not a fan of the crunchier, flat version. I like a bit of a thicker and more fluffy cookie. Which these are, however, they taste pretty bland.

These are delicious! My first ever attempt at snickerdoodles, and they are wonderful. I must have made mine larger, as I only yielded 2 dozen. The cookie is chewy with buttery flavor and the cinnamon sugar (I did add about 1.5 more T of sugar) made a delightful crisp crust! My kids are begging for more!

I had self-rising flour, so I omitted salt and baking soda. Otherwise, using butter, followed recipe exactly except baked at 375 for 8 minutes. Perfect!

My friend bit into a snickerdoodle and frowned. "Hard." said she. "I haven't found a single snickerdoodle that's soft in my life!" "There is but one recipe I have found that is soft." said I. This recipe will blow your socks off. Deliciously soft, it's like biting into a cloud. Search no more friend, this is it!!!

This recipe maakes soft, chewy, delicious cookies.  I prefer this recipe over other snickerdoodle recipes because it uses butter instead of shortening. I followed the revipe exactly.

These are delicious!  I love it that the ingredients are simple and are things that I usually have on hand. I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I substituted 1.5 tsp. of baking powder for the cream of tartar and baking soda.  I learned that baking powder is 2:1 cream of tartar and baking soda. It worked great. I definitely recommend this recipes. Added bonus that my house smells amazing:)

These cookies are lovely, nice basic snicker doodles. I love that they use butter instead of shortening. Easy recipe that I followed exactly except I smashed the cookies with my palm since they don't spread much. I lowered my temperature to 380 degrees F and baked for ten minutes. I let cool a few min on cookie sheet then transfer to wire rack. They were still chewy but not raw. They were the hit of the Christmas potluck and one woman asked how I made them chewy. Tasty!

I just made these cookies for the first time tonight. I have made another Snickerdoodle recipe over the years, but my family told me these are the best. My husband doesn't even like Snickerdoodles and he absolutely loved these. My son said these are the best cookies he has ever had. Tomorrow night? They are off to a Boy Scout Christmas Party for others to enjoy. So glad I chose to make these cookies! They are easy and very delicious! Thank You Sue! Your Recipe will be a family keeper.

I needed to add another 1/2 cup of butter and another egg to get these moist enough. Also the 2 T sugar to 2 t cinnamon wasn't enough. But after all that was sorted out, they turned out pretty yummy!

Very good recipe. The cookies were super soft and chewy. Even better if you microwave them the next day. I unbelievably ran out of cinnamon (I know...who runs out of cinnamon?), so I used the McCormick Cinnamon-Sugar mixture and threw in a little nutmeg. Turned out pretty well.

I just made this.  It is really good.  They come out more rounded than I thought and flattened them with a bottom of a cup just like others suggested.  I guess it's just a preference for what you want the cookies to look like.  These were great...soft and chewy in the middle.   They are delicious !

This is my favorite snickerdoodle recipe.  I recently had to alter the recipe to accommodate a friend who has a dairy allergy.  I substituted butter with 1/3C butter flavored Crisco, substituted eggs with 6T of natural applesauce and upped flour to 3C.  They still came out fabulous.  On another side note: I do flatten them a little before I put them in the oven.

I'm not the biggest fan of Snickerdoodles, but this recipe was amazing! Baked them for a friend in exchange for computer repairs and he absolutely loved them too! Added Heath chips just because we are suckers for all the things toffee. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This cookie is my husbands favorite. Ive never cooked these until now but this recipe was so easy, i had to try it. its now in my cookbook. everyone in the house loved them. i did change the all purpose flour, salt, and baking soda combo for regular self rising flour. Their appearance out of the oven was puffy however as they cooled they "deflated" a tad. my second pan I used a fork to smashed them a bit as I would a peanut butter cookie. I will probably double the recipe next time around because they were such a hit with the family. thanks!

I made a few batches of this recipe and found that following it exactly resulted in cookies that were a little too hard, tall, and heavy on cinnamon. I also experimented with a bunch of the recommendations of other reviews and got better results. Definitely take the suggestions of other reviewers who recommend: 1) baking at a slightly lower temperature (or for less time), unless you like crispy/hard cookies; 2) wet your hands to roll the balls (otherwise the dough sticks); 3) flattening the balls a bit when you put them on the pan; 3) using a higher sugar to cinnamon ratio for the coating (depending on your tastes, obviously). These are worth making again with the above adjustments!

Not enough butter.  I added another 1/2 cup because all snickerdoodle recipes with the same amount of flour called for 1 cup of butter or shortening.  Otherwise the cookies taste great!

Seriously amazing taste, flavor, and texture. But I made the balls under one inch, flattened them with a shot glass, and cooked at just under 400 and still had semi-uncooked centers with crisp outsides (though the dough isn't very wet so this isn't too much of an issue). Definitely turn the oven closer to 375 to get the centers cooked unless you make them thin.

Cookie tasted okay. Dough is kind of too sticky to roll into ball then into sugar so it wasn't really a ball shape. Replaced cream of tatar with vinegar since no one even uses cream of tartar. Cookies were kinda dry. Probably not gonna make these again but they were edible.

These snickerdoodles are delicious, and I have made them many times.  I do agree with another review that it works best to turn the oven down to 370 degrees F.  Other than that, I make no changes, and they always turn out great.

Made these for the first time.  They are wonderful and so easy to make.  I used China Cinnamon(Tung Hing) and they had a nice cinnamon flavor. This cookie will be on my holiday Top Ten Cookie List....my family will be grateful.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

this is the best cookie recipe ever! Sooo easy and the cookies come out great, even at high altitude. I didn't add cream of tartar but they turned out great without it. Just like baking other cookies, make sure you keep an eye on the time because these could burn easily!

I love snickerdoodles and haven't had one in years.  Tried this recipe and it is perfect!  My husband even described them as the BEST COOKIE EVER!  Which is amazing, he doesn't say that about anything.  Really really good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is going in my recipe box.

I had a craving for snickerdoodles and didn't have any butter in the house, so I went to the substitutions chart for this site and used vegetable oil instead. I got delicious and picture perfect cookies, baked at 375 for nine minutes. Yummy!

Best Snickerdoodle Recipe to date! I have tried many snickerdoodle recipes both out of cook books and off the internet and nothing compares to these. They come out very soft and fluffy and taste delicious. I even made a very large cookie (approx 7in in diameter, cooked at 350 for 14 min) and it came out perfect.

AWESOME cookies (: The best snickerdoodles I have ever made! I did add a little more cinnamon to the coating, but that's only because my husband likes them that way. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was the perfect snickerdoodle recipe.  I followed the exact recipe, except for baking at 375 for about 10 min.  They are just a tad crisp on the edges and nice and soft inside.  Quick to make and a great result!

They ended up a little crispier than I hoped.  I also had to flatten them to make bake up cookie shaped rather than ball shaped. Still, delicious.

This is now my go-to Snickerdoodle recipe.  Wonderful flavor.  Puffed up during baking, producing nice cracks on the top of the cookie.  I like my snickerdoodles on the chewier side, and these were it!

Excellent cookies! I followed the advice and baked at 375, for 8-10 minutes.  I didn't have cream of tartar and used baking powder (same amount) instead and it was great. Really soft, chewy inside. And they're pretty, too!

These were just okay for us. We prefer flatter, chewier cookies and these were stiffer, "poofier" cookies. I do like the lower butter content and not shortening on this one, so that is definitely a postive. I may still try to find a recipe w/o shortening that results in a chewier cookie.

Marvelous!! I didn't have time to look for our family recipe so I used this one since I know that my mom used butter and not shortening.  I took these to a block party and they were a hit!  One lady told me that they were the best Snickerdoodles she had ever had.  She liked that they were chewy. I did lower the oven to 375 degrees and baked them for exactly 9 minutes and they were perfect!

Learned to chill the dough (about an hour) before I start rolling, b/c it holds its shape better. Wetting my hands before rolling, did help keep it from sticking also. Lowered the temperature to 350 for 9-11 min (9 kept center a little doughy & outside perfect, so probably more like 10-12). Tastes perfect with ingredients as is.

These cookies were delicious! I will make them again. They were really easy. I read the reviews first and changed some things. Didn't have cream of Tartar, but it's not a big deal it still tastes good.  Someone said to turn the oven down a bit, I did. Cooked them for 11min at 375 and used a glass to flatten them and they came out perfect.  My husband and I almost ate all of them in one day! They're my husband's favorite and he loves them!

The recipe in my opinion was too dry.  There is a reason that we use 1/2 cup of Crisco or 1 full cup of butter.  It is to have the perfect texture.  Normally the cooking time is not so high neither.  We usually use 350 or 375.  This would result in a more evenly done cookie. I truely am sorry, but this doesn't not meet my expectation  :-?

Great recipe!  I would bake them under 400, it made the bottoms too brown.  They are a puffy kind of snickerdoodle, and I used a little cinnamon within the cookie and they turned out great.  Everyone who tried them claimed they were the best.  Bake only 8 minutes and cool that way they end up soft instead of crisp.

This recipe was wonderful.  So soft inside.  Remember to mash down the dough balls a little before baking as they do not expand much. I used a convectionate oven.

This is okay, but not nearly as good as the original Betty Crocker recipe I've used for 25 years or so. That recipe uses shortening.  I use the Butter-Flavored Crisco -- makes for a wonderful texture and flavor.  My mother had a specialty bakery.  She always says butter shortening is much better for baking than butter or margarine.  And, everyone has always loved her cookies and cakes.

This is a very good recipe I would definitely recommend. I could not find my recipe I normally use and this one was the closest and they came out a little better than my normal recipe so this one will probably replace the one I was using for years

Alright, I took some suggestions -- Doubled the vanilla, added 1tsp cinnamon, used a little less flour (I ended up throwing some in tward the end so I'd say it was somewhere between 2 1/2 and 2 3/4 cups.), and baked for 9 min at 375. What I got was flat and crunchy yet chewy snickerdoodles. It would be interesting too try the recipe again and see if they are fluffier when followed exactly (although I can't imagine not adding the extra cinnamon, especially since I like a lighter cinnamon sugar mixture for rolling). I know that others said they got a rounder snickerdoodle, but my experience is that with these alterations it makes a perfect flat one.

Not only were these cookies super easy to make, they taste awesome! I didn't have the cream of tartar and they turned out fine. I cooked them at 385 degrees for a longer time (up to 15 minutes or more depending on the size of cookies), and they are perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

I have a snickerdoodle recipe that I have been using for years, but thought I'd like to try one made with oleo instead of shortening.  These are very good, and the recipe I will use for now on. Thank you.

My daughter who loves snickerdoodles thought they were wonderful.  I made them three days ago and my husband had one today and says they taste just as good as the first day. What an easy recipe to follow. I will definitely make these soon.

I really like that the recipe uses butter instead of a butter/shortening mix. This is the first time I've made Snickerdoodles and I thought they turned out great. I would definitely make these again.

oh WOW this cookie is good!!!  I made it exactly how it is posted.  They turned out great, they puff up real nice.  I baked them at 400 for 10 min.  I had looked at all the other recipies on here, but liked that this one had less butter.  The others had 1 cup.  MMMMMM...oh so tasty!!!!
3 days later---oh I have to comment how good these cookies are!!  they were still soft 3 days later.  like pillows, oh man this is now my favorite cookie!!

These were fantastic. I have made snickerdoodles before and they have never turned out this soft and tasty. Everyone loved them. One thing I did for a special treat was I put a few m&ms on top just for a little crunch. They looked so pretty I think I might do that for Christmas in red and green colors.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars simply for the fact that I made them exactly as directed and they came out wonderful...didn't change a thing, and several people asked for the recipe!  However, I can't submit my review without pointing out that this is the EXACT recipe that's on the back of the bag of Gold Metal flour I used, minus the shortening.  I wonder how this recipe got approved for allrecipes.com with credit being given to Sue W. and not Gold Metal.

Great cookie!!  I baked these at 365 for 8 minutes & they were crisp on the outside & tender & chewy on the inside. After I rolled them in the sugar/cinnamon combo I made a small thumbprint on the top & added more sugar/cinnamon to each one. These really rock!! Thanks for the grest recipe!

I followed the recipe as it was (temp wise) but found I was out of tarter.  I substituted 3 tsp of lemon juice, as my substitution chart indicated.  Therefore, anything I say is contingent upon the substitution.  The cookies did hold their shapes so I had to kind of flatten them with the spatula.  Also, I think that probably others are correct - 400 degrees for 8 minutes is too hot.  I will make these again because the dough was delicious but I will cook at 350.  I like really chewy cookies and these are a bit on the crisp side.

Yum!!  I've never had snickerdoodles before and these were great.  I used this recipe because it didn't use shortening and I'm glad I did.  I did use 4T sugar and 4tsp cinnamon, I had a bit left over but it was easy to roll them in; I think I'll do 3T/3t next time.  I also used 1 tsp white vinegar in place of the cream of tartar that I didn't have.

I don't believe in using anything but butter in baking, so was happy to come across this recipe. I did turn the heat down a bit, to 350 as suggested, and they were great. My brother-in-law actually asked for the recipe--how weird is that?

This is the best snickerdoodle recipe that I have tried.  Family loved them and they had a better taste/texture over the cookies with shortening in them.  I followed the recipe exactly but dropped temp down to 375 and kept them in 10-11 minutes.  Wonderful!

I have been making snickerdoodles since I was a kid and these were by far the BEST ones I have ever made. They were soft and chewy sooooo good! I followed this recipe exactly except I turned the heat down to 350F and I baked them for EXACTLY 8 minutes!! No longer or they will be too hard! They were perfect!!

These cookies are wonderful! We've made them several times. The only word of caution: be sure not to overbake them. We kept over-baking them because they just didn't look done in 8 minutes. But then they would get hard as a rock. So pull them out on time and you'll be glad you did!

Good recipe--only things changed were pressing them lightly with a flat bottomed cup and brought down the temp/cooking time...350 for 8-9 minutes.  The cookies cooked/hardened on the cooling rack.  With the changes, I got soft/chewy ones, which were way better than the hard ones!

First off, don't know what Jim was taking about...these were great with a few revisions! We used 1 cup of Blue Bonnet margarine, omitted the cream of tartar, and used 3T sugar and 3tsp cinnamon for the topping. We also baked for 9 minutes at 375 and they were perfect! Will definitely use this recipe again. Hint: the batter may be a little sticky, so you may want to chill it in the fridge to firm it up a bit.

These were delicious! Not too sugary and not too heavy on the Cinnamon. They came out very light and crisp, and were a hit with the whole family.

Tastes just like a sugar cookie with a hint of cinnamon. We didn't use the Cream of Tartar.

This is my favorite Snickerdoodle recipe so far, as I can use butter instead of shortening. These are very sweet and delicious, one of my family and friend's favorite cookies. It can be tricky to get them cooked just right inside without being too crispy on the bottom though. I have found that I can only cook them for a maximum of 8 minutes, any more and they get a bit burnt on the bottom.

I cannot say this was a recipe that I liked. I believe it was too bland and maybe it needs some cinnamon in the cookie and not just rolled in it.

We enjoyed these cookies but they are a little bit dense for my taste.  The dough seemed pebbly and dry when we mixed it up but maybe that is par for the course with snickerdoodles.

These are very yummy cookies.  I'd never made snickerdoodles before.  These were fairly easy to make and I'm pleased with the outcome.  I followed the recipe exactly except I flattened the dough balls with the bottom of a glass and baked them at 375 for 10-11 minutes.  I will make them again & again.

These are fabulous cookies, plump & moist. The recipe says it makes 24 cookies. I have a large family so I doubled the recipe. This made 112 cookies. My family will eat them all! But if you don't need that many, the one recipe should make 50-60 cookies (instead of 24) depended on the size you roll the ball. Mine were rolled to one inch size as the recipe called for. Yummy!

I lost my husbands family recipe and thought that this was as close to it as I could get. The cookies were good, but not as good as the family recipe. I may have to modify it a little bit. They seemed to be a little dry and a day later they were hard. I will definaly keep looking for my recipe!

had a craving for cookies and found this recipe.  they were great!  i liked how they were soft in the middle and a crispy edge.   
it was a quick recipe to make.  the helpful hint of using a spray oil on your hands help it was being sticky.  i used more cinnamon to my taste.

These cookies were fantastic! The consistency was superb, and it wasn't to chewy. I didn't have time to beat the butter, so I melted them instead. They turned out great! Note: they keep for about three days.

They turned out looking like scones, with about the same texture.  Not very sweet at all either.  Store bought Snickerdoodles taste better than these!

My first snickerdoodle experience.  I found the batter a bit dry, so I added a bit of water.  Delicious.

I chose this recipe in an effort to avoid the shortening in my regular recipe. Texture is a bit different but still delicious.

These are great!  I read in another review that they didn't flatten out very well, so I flattened them before coating them in the cinnamon/sugar.  They turned out amazing--crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside!

My husband loves snickerdoodles.  The recipe his mom has is a long waste of time.  I'm more of the quicker the better type when it comes to baking.  These are just as good as hers, but a lot faster to  make.

My best friends mom always used to make these for me when I was little, because they were my FAVORITE cookies. When I came accross this recipe, I just had to try it to see how close these are to what I remember. Turns out, they are very close. Brought back lots of fond memories, so thank you for sharing this recipe. :)

The cookie itself was too "runny" to roll into balls. I needed to add more flour to it. It also didn't taste like a true snickerdoodle, but was very close.

These were just the snickerdoodles I was hoping for!  Excellent and pretty easy to make!  I made them for Thanksgiving, and now have been asked to make them for Christmas also! :-)  A new tasty treat for me to make and impress people with!  Thanks!
