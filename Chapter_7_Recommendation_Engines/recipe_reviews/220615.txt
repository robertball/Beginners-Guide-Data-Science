Don't think 'pancakes'  - they are really Potato Latkes.   You don't really taste the apple, none the less they are very good.   I used one huge russet baking potato - grated it into a salad spinner full of cold water - rinsed the potatoes a couple of times to remove the excess starch - grated the apple into the same bowl, drained and spun  it dry.  Then I rinsed the bowl of the salad spinner and used that to mix the eggs, potatoes, onions etc... in.  (one less bowl to wash)  I used a heavy non stick skillet with just a bit of oil on the bottom.  Once you get the potatoes into the skillet don't move or flip them until the edges are golden brown.  Perfect, crispy - a delicious Sunday morning treat.

I thought this was very good.   I used 7 small russet potatoes (the size that comes in the 10lbs bags)and one Granny Smith apple.   Very easy to make, served with homemade apple sauce, a great combination.

I was intrigued at the thought of potato pancakes/latkes with apple. You can't fully discern the apple, but it adds mild sweetness. However, they were a little bland. I didn't have any green onions so I used a small regular onion and it was fine.  My family all enjoyed these with both low-fat sour cream and applesauce.

I really enjoyed this. Since some said the Apple taste didn't really come through I made it with 2 apples. I think next time I will make it with 3. I also did not peak the apples. Why waste the most nutritious part of the apple. I probably won't peak the potatoes either next time. Oh and while my husband enjoyed it, he suggested saving time by not making the pancake shape and just frying it all up like hash browns. I love that idea and then just use it for a side dish!

I was looking for something to make using the 3 leftover baked potatoes I had. This recipe fit the bill nicely. I like the addition of grated apple. It adds a subtle but pleasant flavor. Because I started out with grated baked potato, there was no need to squeeze them dry. I added one cooked & crumbled slice of bacon & fried them in coconut oil with a smidge of the bacon grease for flavor. My boyfriend liked them a lot (he put salsa on top of his), but the kids didn't care for them until I said they could top them with shredded cheese AND pick out the green onion. Next time, I might leave out the green onion & use onion powder for that reason.

Fabulous!  Quite a different spin on traditional latkes by adding shredded apple.  Hubby loved them!

Ooh good. Used some regular onion but green onions would be better, added extra apple and squeezed moisture out by hand squeezing. Held together well but still added an extra egg for second batch. Used red potatoes instead of russets. Coconut oil for frying. Very delicious.
