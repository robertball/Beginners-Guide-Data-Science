Trishie's Chinese-Style Salad Dressing this is the salad dressing I suggest you use for the salad.
janeane1 sorry you didnt see this before you made the salad. I came up with this salad to enjoy with another on site recipe. Hopefully you will try it again with Trishie's Chinese-Style Salad Dressing. Thanks for tying it and giving a nice review.

The salad ingredients are interesting--but it needs some kind of dressing.  I added a simple vinegar/oil dressing and it was OK.
