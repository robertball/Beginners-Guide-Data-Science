I made this recipe and used a whole chicken instead of chicken parts.  A visiting friend commented that the smell of the marinade was savory and made her hungry. The chicken marinaded for about five hours and that was enough to suffuse much of the meat with garlicky-sweet flavor.  The browned bits of seasonings on the skin was a big plus.  This fed my family, including picky children, without any complaint, only compliment!  I did serve with rice, but could see how with mashed potatoes and turning the pan drippings into gravy it would've been excellent too.

We thought this was pretty good.  I cut back on the cumin a bit and added a little chile powder and cayenne pepper.  I don't think it needed quite so much oil.  It was a bit greasy.  When I make this again, I'll use less.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use this recipe for pulled pork in the slow cooker.  EXCELLENT!  Just mix all the marinade ingredients together (except the oil of course) and pour over the pork in the slow cooker and let it go for 6-8 hours.  FABULOUS!  My family and friends love it!  Thanks for the recipe

I guess I was expecting much more flavor from the marinade than what I got.  Don't get me wrong, the chicken was tender and moist, but I just didn't taste much in the way of seasonings.  Next time, I'll probably add some more cumin and maybe some smoked paprika or hot sauce for some zing.  Thanks, Karmicflower.

Delicious recipe. I doubled the marinade since I placed the chicken whole in a large bowl in the fridge. I ran short on olive oil, so I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup canola oil. Almost the entire chicken was covered, although half way through I turned the chicken. I marinaded the chicken for a total of 10 hours. Before roasting the bird (whole) I sprinkled the skin with a little paprika. I followed the instructions on this site for roasting a chicken using the high heat method. I highly recommend this as it results in a nice crispy skin. I'll be making this again. Thank you!

My husband made this for us and although we loved it (the chicken had great flavor), we found that ½ cup of oil was waaaay too much!  Next time he makes this he is going to try with a ¼ of a cup of oil, possibly even less than that.  Also, he let it marinade overnight; I don't think 4 hours is enough to infuse all the flavors into the chicken.  Our 11 year old, extremely picky eater loved the taste too; otherwise we would add some chilies to spice it up!  And I agree with one other reviewer, you could easily have this with mashed potatoes and turn the drippings into wonderful gravy!!!  Thanks for a great recipe, minus some of the oil for us!

I liked this very much! I'm falling in love with Cuban food, at least the dishes on this site!  Made as written, except did not  heat garlic & spices in olive oil first, and I am sure it would have been even more tasty if I had.  Even with unheated oil it was 5 stars!

my whole family loved this recipe.  I marinated the chicken overnite, and cooked it for 55 minutes, and it turned out very tasty and moist. I will make this again and again.  This recipe is a keeper!

I marinated for about 30 hours. The oven was in use so I grilled the chicken. The flavors really penetrated the meat, and every bite was a treat. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was not very impressed with the flavor of this chicken.  It didn't really take the spices into the meat - if I were to make it again I would double or triple the amount of seasonings in the marinade. It did come out very moist and juicy (375 degrees for 50 minutes, rested for 10).  I'd recommend using a boiler pan to separate the drippings.

The last night I spent in Havana I went to a restaurant and had chicken and rice/black beans.  This chicken is exactly like the chicken that they served and it was excellent.  The only thing I changed was to add a tablespoon of lemon juice to the marinade.  I served it with black beans and it was amazing!!!  Just like I was back in Havana (complete with salsa music and a mojito!)

Better than the resturants'!  I love pollo asado from the mexican resturant and wanted to make it at home.  This recipie is definately a keeper!  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and added paprika and subbed 1T pineapple concentrate for the oj (because it was all I had)  It turned out moist, tender and very tasty.  The whole family loved it.  served it with homemade frijoles and cheese, and mexican rice in a flour tortilla.

Really good marinade. I had a busy day planned so I threw all of this in the crockpot without ever marinating it and cooked it on low all day. It was very flavorful. I just shredded up the meat to serve with tortillas and toppings. The only thing I might do a little differently is to put the shredded meat on a baking pan and crisp it up in the oven just a little. It was great this way but I enjoy carnitas this way. I used bonelss chicken thighs (what we had) and avocado oil instead of evoo.

Used chicken breasts, cut into hunks for kabobs.  Marinated 4-6 hours then grilled on my grill pan indoors.  Chicken was juicy and good, but I wasn't wow'd.

Excellent- I have found my favorite spanish style bbq chicken - what is not to like?   Great on the grill - I haven't put it in the oven and not sure if I will.  I don't recommend any changes to the recipe.

I was looking for a quick sauce or marinade based on lime and this fit the bill perfectly. I halved the recipe for a couple defrosted chicken thighs and only let it sit before grilling maybe 10-15 mins. But wow, both my husband and I were surprised. The chicken was moist, and very flavorful. I used fresh squeezed lime and orange and we didn't need anything to go on top. Nice simple meal on a hot summer day.

easy marinade that really added flavor to the chicken when refrigerated overnight.  I used fresh limes for the lime juice and tossed the limes in with the chicken for the marinating overnight (obviously discarded before cooking).

I would definitely make this again; it's a very nice way to enjoy a whole chicken.  The method of preparation is very interesting and exciting--when I added the garlic, etc. to the hot oil, it actually seemed to cook it a little bit in the bowl!  Very aromatic.  The chicken only took about 45 mins to cook; my only complaint is it was quite greasy because of all the oil and the natural oils in the skin.  My family liked it a lot; thanks!

This is even more yummy if you grill the meat instead of roasting in the oven.  I have tried both ways and think that grilling really sets off the flavors of the marinade in a whole new way.  It comes out more like what I have had at a mexican restaurant.  I would serve this with guacamole and yellow rice.

I have made this many times. Exactly accourding to recipe. You could call it garlic chicken. I make it exactly according to directions with drumsticks and it comes out delicious. The only "downside" with this recipe is that is very oily. However, I would not cut back on the oil since it is key in making moist chicken.

This recipe was wonderful. I didn't have any orange juice so I substituted Passion Fruit Juice. I was only able to marinate for about an hour, and it was still excellent!

The chicken turned out real juicy and the citrus in the marinade was laced throughout the dish.  I was expecting a bit more spice in the flavor of the chicken and after researching some more Mojo sauce recipes I think I"ll add paprika next time to give it some of that extra spice.

It was good.  I had made this with a whole chicken as I didn't want to go through the steps to cut it up.  I think I'd rather have chicken peices.  Used 1 tsp cumin.  Otherwise used the recipe as it is.  Came out tender.

This recipe is delicious! My very picky 8 year old says this is the best recipe on all of All Recipes. Like other reviewers, I reduced the oil down to 1/4 cup. I also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon. I use 3 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and marinate for at least 4 hours. Then I pan fry until the pieces are cooked through (about 15 minutes). These are great in children tacos!

Ran out of cumin so substituted 1tsp caraway seed and 1/2tsp paprika.  It was great.

Great flavor in 4 hours. Much better than of the shelf mojo. My change I made was in using dime zest from the lime and orange

This was DELICIOSO. As a NYer who moved to Sacramento, I deeply miss going to my neighborhood Dominican restaurant. There aren't any Carib restaurants to match the ones back home, so I'm forced to hunt for tasty recipes. I searched high and low on the web for a recipe that was similar to their rotisserie chicken and the flavors here were super close. I made two 4.5 pound chickens and doubled the rest of the recipe, which resulted in a bit more liquid but actually turned out ok. Especially since I baked them for about 1.5 uncovered then another 45 mins covered the with my roasting pan top. Use your judgement. Ovens vary.

had this chicken type recipe from a Chicken Van at the side of the road in Marbella - Spain. Was amazing from there and wanted to make it at home. As it is street food/ take away it was served in a foil tin with the marinade in the bottom. A separate tin for fries and a fresh baked baguette to dip into the oil etc. After marinating the chicken, remove it from the bag and cook in an oven dish. Make sure you keep the marinade which you can reheat separately, add together the chicken juices from cooking and use to dip a fresh baguette into.

Made according to recipe, this was good, smelled good the first time I made this, but left us feeling it need a bit more.
Second time, I used BADA Sour Orange juice 1+cup, more garlic, and Serrano chili powder, marinated 18 hours in fridge, and roasted on a rotisserie.  Turned out much better, very moist, flavor permeated the entire chicken, and the skin was wonderful.  We also used homemade Pique, the traditional condiment served with meat in Puerto Rico & many islands. I will be submitting the recipe separately soon with the amounts used.

REALLY good! Tangy and bright. I did not heat the marinade, and it was still excellent. Will try grilling it next time, and making kebabs or fajitas/tacos another time.

This is an all time favorite especially when on the go in the RV and feeding a group of friends! It is requested every time we caravan with friends!  I also cut back on the cumin because it can totally overpower the marinade.  But aside from that, makes the best chicken for burritos!

Maybe my hopes were too high.  The citrus was nowhere to be found in the flavor of this chicken.  Maybe it just needs more in the marinade.  The chicken was very tender and we enjoyed it.  But where did the citrus go?

I have made this many times and absolutely love it.  I usually use chicken thighs and can either throw them on the grill or in the oven and they turn out great every time. I use lemon and lime juice when I don't have orange and toss in a little Adobo.  Usually we eat them like street tacos with warmed corn tortillas and a little salsa verde. Totally YUM! It's so good that even Mr. Picky I'll only eat white meat chicken man will eat whatever part of the bird I serve him.

Very good!!  Marinated for about 5-6 hours, reduced the oil to 3-4 T and added 3/4 tsp smoked paprika and 1/4 tsp ancho chili powder.   Also had a meyer lemon on hand so used that instead of the lime juice.  Delicious!!  Will definitely become a staple.

I did up some extra marinade and did a whole chicken. Tossed some cut up potatoes with the left over marinade and baked the whole thing in a roaster.  It was very moist and tasty.

Fantastic!! I used Spanish Bitter Orange (you can find that in the Spanish section of your grocery store) instead of orange juice. I went easy on the olive oil and used organic chicken (normally they are less fatty). Make sure you trim all extra fat from the skin (as much as you can) otherwise, it’ll be very oily.
