Amazing.  The quinoa was the only good quinoa I've ever tasted.  Ha!  I substituted andouille sausage for the chorizo and jalapenos for the poblanos.  Turned out great.  Also, instead of removing sausage from pan, I sliced it first, cooked, then just added everything else in according to the instructions.  I thought this was easier and added flavor to the whole dish.

Had being hearing all sorts of good things about Quinoa so last time I was at the store, I picked some up. Not knowing what to do with it, I searched allrecipes.com and found this! The dish was very good. I will make again. Followed directions but you can definitely cook much less Quinoa. I had plenty extra after eating all the peppers and sausage. Also I used Pork Chorizo because there was no Chicken Chorizo at the market I shop.

Delicious! Recipe is a great base for modifications - omitted bell peppers and it was wonderful.  Also made only 2 cups quinoa (to 4 cups stock) and had leftovers.  This was my first attempt at making and eating quinoa and I am hooked!

I'm giving this recipe five stars because it got me thinking in a different direction.  Due to flavour preferences and what I had on hand, my dish became more of an Italian rather than Spanish inspired dish, but it was wonderful.  And it got me to try quinoa (which is now a staple in my kitchen!)...

I don't make a lot of recipes twice, but this is DELIC!  I tweaked it by cutting the recipe in half, and added spicy chicken sausage.

Yummy!  I didn't have sausage so I used chicken, would have been better with Sausage but still turned out well.  I also didn't have the hot peppers, so to add flavor I used spicy V8 instead of the last cup of chicken stock.   Will make again with the correct ingredients.

This was so GOOD!!  First time trying Quinoa and I loved it.  I will be using it over and over again in other recipes.  I did use vegetable stock because I didn't have Chicken and less quinoa because I thought it was a lot and not sure I was going to like it.  I also added mushrooms chopped fine with the onions because I had some:)  A lot of good flavor going on here.....

We liked this recipe a lot, however, when I make it again I'll only make half the amount of quinoa because we have tons left and not enough peppers/sausage to go with it.  My boyfriend added hot sauce but I liked the flavor just the way it was.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. We had to sub. a few things because I didn't have true ingredients. I sub. ground sausage for chicken chorizo and smoked paprika. I imagin the original recipe must be delisious. I will try it again once I find chicken chorizo. Thanks for great dish..

This was delicious and easy to make (very much a novice cook over here and I didn't have to call my sister once to say something like, "So, sauteeing ... what is that?). But it was also totally delicious and flavorful. I like things hot so I may add some chili power next time to kick it up a notch. Also: We had a ton of quinoa left over, so I would suggest only making one cup instead of three (don't forget to cut the chicken broth too).

Thank you! I was in a hurry for dinner, and thought, "Quinoa and sausage?", found your recipe, used italian bulk sausage from the freezer, modified the spices accordingly, added a tomato (just because the freeze is coming soon) and we were all so happy. The proportion of quinoa is high for the amount of sauce, but since it tastes so good prepared this way, no one will mind having leftovers for lunch.

Took a while to cook the first time, but I think now that I know what is involved this will be a nice, quick weeknight meal.

This was very tasty.. good directions.  Enjoyed it very much!

Used red pepper flakes, garlic powder & precooked quinoa and vegetable broth because that's what I had on hand. Came out just fine. I really like quinoa with vegetables.

I used a sprouted rice and quinoa blend which has a nuttier flavour, regular chorizo sausage and subbed the bell and chile peppers for a couple of handfuls of regular red, yellow and green pepper and it was fabulous! Really flavourful, but the spice wasn't too overwhelming for the kids! Plates were cleaned, and requests made to make it again!

I used a light spray of olive oil cooking spray instead of butter, and in place of olive oil, because I'm on a low fat diet. For the same reason, I used 2 small, lean boneless skinless chicken breasts, and no chorizo sausage. For the peppers, I used 2 large purple bell peppers from my garden, and 3 green cayenne chili peppers, also from my garden, and a dried ancho chili, seeded and cut into small pieces. I also added a small plum tomato and three yellow pear tomatoes to the pepper and onion mixture. Wonderful! Will definitely make again.

This was great! I had to change a couple of things due to the lack of chorizo here. I used regular link already cooked chorizo, but it worked perfectly. We love quinoa, and my kids wolfed this down with an occasional glass of milk to curb the heat!

Excellent recipe!  I didn't do the Quinoa part because I didn't have any - served on top of Italian sun-dried tomatoe cous-cous.  Followed rest of recipe but used chorizo (beef or pork - don't know but it wasn't chicken).  Flavor was excellent!  Thanks for sharing!
