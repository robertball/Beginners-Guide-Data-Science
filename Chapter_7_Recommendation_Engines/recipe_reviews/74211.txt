Sorry, Heathermaree, but this recipe just didn't quite make the cut for my family.  I made it according to the directions with the exception of using all thighs instead of mixed pieces.  It smelled very acidic while baking, which proved to be the case when eaten.  The garlic and onion salt weren't recognizable over the sharpness of the lemon and vinegar.  Someone else may love it though, so thanks for sharing!

We loved this from age 2 to adult.  It's obviously going to be strongly flavored lemon/vinegar, which is why we liked it. We tried it with 1 Tbsp of Trader Joes 21 Seasoning Salute and a little salt and pepper (instead of the onion salt and garlic salt).  This switch was even better.  Served with brown rice & broccoli, and spooned the extra liquid onto them as well. Such a refreshing change of flavors.
