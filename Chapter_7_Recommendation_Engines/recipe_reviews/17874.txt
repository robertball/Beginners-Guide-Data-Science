This bread is very good.  It did sink a little.  Everyone enjoyed it and couldn't believe that it was made with cantaloupe.

This bread not only fainted in the machine...it really is not very good. Doesn't retain any of the cantaloupe flavor.  Can't imagine anyone liking it very much. ???

The bread itself tasted fine, mildly sweet, but not at all like cantaloupe.  However, it boiled over and made a huge mess in my bread machine.  I tried it a second time, substituting whole wheat flour which rises less and ended up with an inedible loaf of bread, and a bread machine that's practically ruined from dough that poured over the edges and burned all over the sides.

I was a bit wary of trying this recipe and thought ahead that it might be a waste of flour because it sounds so strange, but it turned out really well.  The only change I made is that I didn't include the gluten, and I didn't have quite enough cantaloupe so blended it all and added a bit of water.  I will keep this recipe and will probably make again whenever I have leftover cantaloupe.

Great!  I followed the recipe as written even though I questioned the paprika.  The bread had a beautiful color and great elasticity.  We plan on using it for sandwich bread.  Even though the canteloupe I used had a strong taste, barely a hint of canteloupe could be detected.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe makes a gorgeous golden loaf with a delicate scent, can't say it is actual cantaloupe but the actual fruit's flavor isn't that strong to begin with. The texture turned out a little bit moist and crumbly, almost like cornbread, also did not grow as much as I expected considering the amount of flour, but I did not have vital gluten on hand which could have likely caused this. Will definitely make again if I find myself with too much cantaloupe.

I made this gluten free, so used 2 1/2 cups of puree  and no chunks. It rose beautifully, has a great crumbled flavor and lovely color
