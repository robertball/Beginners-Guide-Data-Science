This recipe was very good.  I was a little doubtful when I put in the green beans, but they tasted great.  Corn would work too.  My husband and I both liked it.

Nothing really spectacular with this one. Pretty simple and quick and easy to make, but not a staple in our kitchen. Could taste better if I had used fresh tomatoes, fresh green beans and maybe some white wine?? That would maybe eliminate some of the canned taste the dish had.

Delicious! Used a recipe from this site for Creole Seasoning Blend. Used fresh green beans because I had some on hand. Subbed a vegetarian chicken substitute. Turned out very tasty and the picky eater I served it to liked it.

I must admit I wasn't sure when I read this, but it turned out great and my boyfriend loved it too! I didn't add the beans cause he doesn't like them, but I added corn as one reviewer suggested. I didn't have creole seasoning or whatever so I used carribean jerk spice. I was filling and tastey! Next time I am going to try it with some sort of pasta instead of rice. It also lead me to my own ideas for other meals similar.

This one really surprised me. I wasn't so sure I would care for it, but it was very good! My kids enjoyed it also. I used french style canned green beans. I poured the tomato/bean mixture over the sauteed chicken in the skillet and let it all simmer together for a few minutes. I will make this again-definitely.

Some more tips: Creole and Cajun seasoning are the same thing, I believe. I use a brand called Tony's which is great on lots of things.

I like to sprinkle about half the chili powder directly on the chicken as I'm browning it.

You can experiment with the veggies. I use frozen green beans. I also like to add a can of mushrooms and about 6oz. frozen spinach, but that's not for everyone.

Finally, for anyone doing South Beach, this is Phase 1 friendly if you omit the rice. For Phase 2, use brown or wild rice.

This was pretty good, very filling. I would have liked more seasoning and used the creole seasoning recipe here on Allrecipes, so not sure if a commercial mix would have been better. I could also probably use some fresher spices. But I'd make it again. Very easy and fast to make.

I didn't have high hopes but we loved it.  I left out the chili powder and used extra creole seasoning. I  added a can of corn along with the other vegetables.  I also added onion and garlic.

I'll admit, I normally do not like spicy food at all. I will say that once I clear the tears from my eyes this recipe was pretty fantastique and everyone else agreed. The cajun seasoning worked well enough as far as I can tell and besides having to rehydrate my own beans I didn't have any mishaps. Corn does seem like it would really suit this dish and I'll probably try that the next time I make this, which I will.

This was really good, but also really hot.  I love hot foods, but the chili powder and creole seasoning were a bit too overbearing.  I added some corn for color!

My husband wasn't sure he wanted to try this recipe by looking at it but he really liked it.  I thought it was very tasty.  I substituted cajun seasoning for the creole because I could not find it in my grocery store.

Quick delicious and healthy recipe. I made it even healthier by omitting the oil (I sautéed the chicken in a nonstick pan sprayed with Pam) and serving over brown rice instead of white. This one’s a definite keeper!

Easy, fast and tasty. Went over well for some very picky eaters, followed recipe exactly with the exception of adding a little white wine.

This was a hit with my husband. He suggested shrimp or imitation crab as an alternative meat or even leave the chicken and add to it. More like  Gumbo. It needed a little salt in my opinion. I also would have used the spices while cooking the chicken not the vegetables so the flavor would get into the meat more thoroughly. But overall very good and very quick and easy to make.

This was just okay, in my opinion. I made it exactly as written (given a choice of green beans, I chose the whole ones, not cut ones). I was kind of surprised that, despite 2.5T of spices, this wasn't really all that spicy. The spices were not out-of-date either, nor did I have a cold to interfere with my sense of taste - it was weird, really, how near-bland this tasted. Plus, though I think green beans have their place, I thought they really threw this dish off - they just didn't seem to be the right kind of bean to have here. On the plus side though, this was probably a very healthy and balanced dish, despite the "okay" taste.

This was a delicious dish and a good way to use items we usually have on hand.  It also makes use of very healthy ingredients.

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it isn't the prettiest dish in the world.  The red, green, and black of the tomatoes, green beans, and black beans was off-putting.  One taste, however, and I was sold!

Really good.  I would make double the rice because it makes it more a complete meal and we ran short.

Quick, easy recipe.  I loved it.  My husband, not so much. Can't convince him of the merit of the canned green bean.
