These were a cute little treat that I especially think kids would like. They were very easy to make. I even combined the honey and chocolate chips and melted them together. I happened to have a bag of prepopped popcorn and used that. The end result was not crispy, but it could be due to the type of popcorn I used. I used a large cookie scoop but ended up having to use my hands to make them round and hold together.
