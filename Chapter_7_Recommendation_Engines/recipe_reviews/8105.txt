I was so excited to not only discover this website, but this recipe. My (ex) Stepmother used to make this when I was a kid, and I would truly sit down and eat half in one sitting. I have craved this cake for the past 20 years and guess what......It's only been out of the oven for half an hour and I'm already on my 3rd piece. It's quick, easy and delicious. The best part is the bitter old ex Stpemother has always refused to give me the recipe as it was a "family recipe".....Whatever....Heres to you Rayetta...Nah, nah,nah nah!, nah!

I baked this cake twice, using the exact same recipe and both times, the cake didn't turn out well. The batter is too little for a 9 inch square pan and the cake didn't rise. What happened and is the cake supposed to be a pudding?

Wow!  What a hit!  Quick, easy, and delicious.  My tips; 1) Do NOT use your Kitchen-Aid mixer (is doesn't chop up the fruit at all; 2) Add a few tablespoons of vegetable oil to the batter & mix well (ensures moisture); 3) Reduce the sauce recipe by half.  This cake is going to be my Thanksgiving contribution this year.

this is the basic recipe my Aunt Dot gave me 45 years ago, doubled the recipe to fit a 9 x 13 pan. Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used the fruit cocktail juice & all, then sprinkle with powdered sugar, walnuts & coconut flakes before baking. Pour the hot butter sauce over the hot cake, while still in the pan. Yummy!!!! personally I don't use a mixer, we like the large pieces of fruit. This cake doesn't last long.

Not quite sure I would classify this as "cake". I added 1 Tbsp. oil and appx. 1 Tbsp of pear juice from the fruit. Turned out more like a bread pudding than a cake, but I assume responsibility since I made the changes. I like the golden crunch that the sugar gives the crust around the edges. I made this in a 9" round pan and baked 45 minutes. Makes a tasty dessert in a pinch. Hint: have some vanilla ice cream on hand for this!

My Hubby LOVES this cake and it is so simple to make for him!  He always requests this for his birthday cake and whatever other special occasion he can think of:"Took out the trash without being asked" Day, "Didn't put an empty (anything) back in the pantry or refrigerator" Day..etc..hehehe

This is a yummy dessert.  I would not call it a cake, though.  More like a pudding.  I really liked the sauce.  This is great to make in a pinch with things you have on hand. Thanks!

This is my favorite cake and I lost my own recipe so I was happy to have found this one but it did not turn out well. I poured the sauce over the cake (like I would with the recipe I had) and it turned the cake to mush. It was also overwhelmingly buttery. I will not be making this recipe again.

This was phenominal! So moist and easy to make. A previous reviewer said not to use your Kitchenaid mixer because it didn't chop up the fruit. Well, I used mine with the white flat beater, and after the batter was mixed I turned the speed up pretty high. This broke the fruit up into smaller chunks but still kept them a good size to taste them in the cake. I'm happy to say I'm not afraid of fruit cake any more!

This cake is awesome! It is very moist (I followed a reviewer's advice and added 2T Oil to the cake mixture).  I did mix it with my kitchen-aid and after it was mixed turned the mixer up (as did another reviewer) to chop the fruit cocktail.  The sauce is very rich and yummy.  I think the sauce is the reason many say it was like pudding, because after putting the sauce on it appears a little liquidy, but it sure is good!  Definately a five star dish!

I’ve been baking for 60 years.  I was careful to follow the directions since I hadn’t made this recipe.  I got it in the oven and realized that there was no mention of coconut or pecans in the ingredients but the picture shows them.  It should also be mentioned that the icing should be cooked to a soft ball stage so that the cake won’t be soggy.  I put the coconut and nuts in the icing just before pouring it on the cake.  The icing was thick and just perfect.

Have made this cake many times but often substitute  crushed pineapple for the fruit cocktail.  It is so delicious either way and so easy to make!

This cake was always my Kids favorite when we went camping. They still even talk about the lidded 9 x 13 pan I would make it in (no longer around). I don't pour the sauce on the cake when freshly baked. I just spoon some on each serving and pop in the microwave when serving. I double everything except as previous poster just use 1 1/2 cups sugar.
