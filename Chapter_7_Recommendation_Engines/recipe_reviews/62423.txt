After reading the reviews for this recipe and seeing some say it was bland I made a couple changes. I zested the lime then juiced it. added 1 Tablespoon honey,I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander instead of the cilantro as it is the seed of the cilantro and has about the same taste and mixes into the marinade easier. Chicken breast would be fine but I used thighs. This was great !

This was the most tender and juicy piece of chicken I've ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly but marinated for about an hour.  It was hard to tell how long to cook the chicken as the grill marks didn't take to it.  Wonderful recipe!

I marinated it closer to an hour and added a garlic & onion seasoning blend to the marinade.  This was delicious!!!  The chicken was rather moist too!  Will definitely be making this again!

This made a very moist grilled chicken, I only marinated it 30 minutes like the recipe called for and you could taste the beer.

GREAT RECIPE!!  I've made this a couple of times now and it's a family favorite.

I added one beer (Miller Light) doubled the amount of honey and lime juice (also added a couple of squirts of lemon juice), mixed together & set aside.

After rinsing off the breasts & patted them down with a paper towel, I scored them and seasoned with adobo (puerto rican seasoning salt - but I think any seasoning salt would be fine), pepper, minced garlic (garlic powder is OK too).  I didn't have cilantro either time, but that would also be a great addition.

I poured the wet mixture over the chicken and let it sit for 30 minutes, turning the breasts over halfway.  My husband grilled them on medium heat for about 9 minutes per side and both times the chicken came out very juicy.

The marinade goes thru the entire chicken!!  I've made many marinades before but this one is tops because it takes very little time, easy ingredients & perfect result!

I marinated the chicken for about 45 minutes. My husband and I both liked this even though we aren't big on garlic. The chicken turned out moist and had a nice flavor and aroma.

Modified the recipe, since it is too bland.  I later used Bud Light Lime, a whole lime, and added 50% more seasonings.  I also aerated the chicken with a fork and marinated it for at least 45 minutes.  Serve on wild rice with leftover lime as a garnish.  Much more full-bodied flavor.  Good recipe!

As I don't drink, I used a non-alcoholic beverage in place of the beer. I found that it worked just as good. I usually eat low-fat, low-sodium meals and this recipe is perfect for anyone who likes those type of recipes. I found it delicious.

The flavor depends upon the beer you choose to use.  We used a flavorful IPA and it was delish.  I understand how it could be bland if using a mild beer.

This was super easy and had a nice, clean but surprisingly strong flavor to it. I added onion to the marinade like others suggested.

I let this marinate for over 24 hours(by accident)and cut the chicken into kabobs. The beer flavor came through, but not much else.  It was very moist, but next time I'll up the other ingredients and marinate for 8 hours.

This was really great!  Next time I'll add a little more honey & garlic. After I grilled the chicken as directed, I sliced it and tossed it with angel hair pasta, a little butter and garlic salt.

I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars. I give it 4 stars because it was an attractive and juicy piece of grilled chicken. But the taste really wasn't anything special. Not a bad taste, just not much of a taste at all. I used Bud Light Lime beer, zested the lime, juiced the lime, left the lime in the marinade, used 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tbsp honey, cilantro and coriander, and salt and pepper. I also marinated it for 4 hours. For some reason I just didn't get too much flavor from it. It was faintly limey, but I guess I had high hopes for an explosion of lime and beer and honey goodness, and it wasn't really there. It left pretty grill marks and it was juicy though. I'll keep this in the recipe box, but I'd rather try new recipes or use old favorites before making this one again.

This recipe was great! I used about a tablespoon of honey, a tablespoon of minced garlic, a quarter cup of cilantro and only half a can of beer (so the other flavours were not diluted) and the chicken was incredible!  This recipe also makes a great salad dressing - just subsitute the beer for red wine vinegar - it is a great compliment to the chicken (I used spinach with peppers, red onion, feta, tomato, cucumber, strawberries aand almonds).  Thanks!

Not what we expected, there was a nice after taste but no flavor in the chicken itself. I would suggest marinating it much longer and make sure you don't run out of propane on your grill....

This was just okay for me as is.  I think the flavor has potential though, so with some modifications (like longer marinating time and maybe some more herbs), I will definitely try it again.  Thanks for sharing it!

Holy moly, this was FABULOUS!!! We aren't allowed to have grills in our apartment complex (yet everyone pretty much does anyway!). So, I had to improvise. I browned the chicken on the stove for about 6 minutes per side. Then, I added the delicious marinade to it, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. I made sure I pierced the chicken while marinating, and I pierced it again a few times when it was on the stove simmering. It was PERFECT! I also added chili powder and cumin to the marinade (about 1 tsp each). I also probably used more honey than called for, and omitted the salt and pepper. I'll be making this again, no doubt. Thanks so much, Lauren!!

We love this recipe and have made it several times over the course of this past summer.  I use chicken tenders to make grilling faster.  The chicken has great flavor and is always tender and moist.  This is a hit for sure.

Boneless chicken breasts on the grill are so easy to overcook.  My suggestion is to buy the much less expensive bone-in breast, grill it with the skin on and if the skin offends you, remove it before serving. Much, much more flavor. There...I said it.  Bon appetit.

So, here's the problem.  The marinade is wonderful.  The grill instructions were fine.  The cooking times are perfect. But, after 30 minutes, the marinade doesn't really shine through.  I did this recipe twice, once with a 30 minute marinade time, and once overnight.  The 30 minutes version was bland and had little flavour. But, the overnight marinade really popped.  clearly, 30 minutes is not enough time to fully penetrate the meat. So, I gave this four out of five stars, as the time for marinating is too short. Otherwise, I would consider this a five star dish.

Very good recipe. This was very tender chicken,  with that great taste of the grill and a hint of lime.  For anyone wanting more flavor try this:  When marinating sprinkle a good dry seasoning of Caribbean flavor on the marinating breasts. Grill until you have sear marks then transfer in a baking dish to a 425 degree oven until done.  There is your key to keep the chicken from drying out. When ready to eat,  put a small ramekin of Pace Lime Salsa Verde on the side to dip your bites into.  Flavor issues solved.  This is actually a very good and easy recipe.  Will be making it again.

This was really good. I made exactly as written, only I poked holes in the chicken with a fork and marinated it for about 4 hours. It was so tender and the flavor was perfect!

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was amazingly moist (even juicy the next day when I reheated it for lunch). We used a can of Miller Light and you could still pick out the beer flavor after cooking. Knowing that, I may use a lime flavored beer next time to enhance the flavor even more.

This was super easy, fresh and delicious. We made with Mexican Rice from this site and it was perfect. We did not have cilantro so just made without and it was great. Really good, easy grilling recipe!

I overcooked the chicken a bit but it still was moist and good flavor. I marinated it all day and it still wasn't strong on any one flavor,they all blended well. Kids loved it!

I added more garlic and some red pepper flakes and marinated overnight.  Since it was about to rain, I grilled them early, put in a baking dish and poured some of the marinade over the chicken (thighs). I'm glad I did this because it rained right after I grilled!  Refrigerated and then baked at 375 for about 20 mins to heat them up, turning once.  Turned out juicy.  Yum!

The marinade for this recipe really is very good. I used pieces of thighs & legs and they probably would have been good but I only marinaded them for 30 minutes and they definitely should have been in there longer. Definitely use chicken breasts and marinate as long as possible. Good recipe though!

Moist chicken and a great marinade.  I only marinated for half an hour; it'd probably be better if you marinated longer.

My husband liked this.  I think we left on on the grill just a minute or two too long - should have taken it off and let it cook a bit.  I couldn't really taste the spices, but it was moist and good.  I added an extra tsp of honey - other than that follwed exactly.  Made with the Pineapple Rice Casserole on a hot summer nite and it was a good light meal for the family.  Will make it again.

We really liked this. The chicken was very juicy and tender. After reading reviews I added some additional spiced to make sure it wasn't bland, added a few dashes of chili powder and about a teaspoon of smoked paprika. Also added the juice of 2 limes and the zest of one lime. Thanks for the recipe, these were really good:)

This was yummy - made it for Cinco de Mayo.  I marinated 6 chk breasts and used 1 tsp coriander rather than the cilantro in the marinade.  The flavor was subtle, yet good.  We grilled on the Traeger which added a smoky flavor to the chicken, which enhanced the lime marinade.  Served with spanish rice, beans & pico de gallo (from the black beans & pico de gallo recipe from this site).  Add a little sour cream, tomatillo salsa, guacamole and it was out of this world!

I thought this was great. The chicken wasn't as moist as I would have liked, but it still tasted great! I marinated this for about two hours and the results were very good.

Added 2 TBSP Soy Sauce for some added flavor.  Chicken was moist, and had a nice subtle beer/lime flavor.  Nice combination of flavors for the grill

I added three times as much lime to this, as well as some garlic juice to go with the crushed garlic. I agree that this chicken is very mild on flavor, but you can add whatever spices you want to taste in order to suit your personal spicinest needs. I marinated this overnight and I think what makes this special is that it makes an extremely moist and tender grilled chicken! I will never grill chicken breast any other way from now on. Thanks for the recipe. It's great!

I did not have honey so I used 2 TBS brown sugar, still worked great.  Also used it for chicken wings and they were the best wings.  It is hard to understand why others don't like this marinade, it is easy to add more spices to the ingredients.

This recipe is so-so at best...I even added more garlic and added ginger, but nothing really popped! Chicken is really bland and needs help with flavors, this recipe is out of my recipe box!!! Sorry not a hit in my house....

I followed this recipe exact except that i let it marinade for 2 hours.  I was shocked that the other reviews were so good because I found it very boring and bland.  I do eat alot of chicken on the grill but this was just tasteless.

I was looking to make some low fat shredded chicken and used this to marinate boneless skinless chicken breasts. Since I was concerned about fat and calories I used Miller 64 and marinated for about 3 hours. It was super juicy and shredded beautifully. It wasn't overly flavorful so I wouldn't make this the star of the meal but I will make it again, maybe experimenting with different beers and pairing it with great sides.  
(I shredded the chicken and made chicken tacos with it, a small can of chopped green chilies, 2/3 cup water and a packet of taco seasoning. Really happy with the results.)

Used Neil and Randy's homebrew IPA, let it marinate for almost 24 hours.  Was spectacular!  Tender, great depth of flavor from the IPA.

Not bad but somewhat lacking in flavor. I served salsa verde and that gave it a kick. Also made mexican rice and a salad.

I made this for my family and as a surprise for my in-laws and everyone loved it! It was the best grilled, moist chicken ever! I left it overnight in the fridge and actually marinated 8 breasts with this recipe.  YUM & I don't even like beer! I will use this recipe all of the time from now on!

Very good!  This recipe is a keeper.  The only thing I added was zest from the lime and marinated it for 2 hrs.

It was delicious! I made a few alterations according to other reviews. I used cumin, smoked chili power, olive oil, lime/lemon (didnt have enought lime), and chicken tenders. My family loved it! Thank you for sharing!

The recipe was a little bland.  The flavor of the honey, lime, and cilantro didn't come through even though I marinated it for 2 days.  If I were to make this recipe again I'd subsitute a darker beer for the light beer, extra honey, and probably a lot more cilantro.  I'd also baste it with melted butter and lime as it's cooking.

This was an excellent marinade for our grilled chicken last night.  It was nice, light and refreshing.  Didn't waste a good can of Bud-Light on this one.  Paired this with the "brown rice" from this site.  Our entire family enjoyed this meal.

Very good but not as full of flavor as I hoped.  Might need to marinated longer than 30 minutes.  Made a few adjustments... added a finely chopped jalapeno and used boneless chicken thighs.

Very good dish.  I zest the lime as someone suggested and I added more garlic and added some onion also.  I let it marinate for about 8 hours.  It turned out fantastic.  I made my wife a nice salad to take to work with some of the left over chicken.  The chicken had a fantastic lime and cilantro flavor.  The beer flavor was there, but the lime is what really took over.  I liked it.

The chicken was very tender and juicy but we found the beer taste a little overpowering. Might recommend trying to finish it with a chipotle rub or some other spices in the marinade.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out very good.  The chicken smelled divine while it was cooking but the taste wasn't overpowering when you actually ate it.  In the future, I wouldn't marinate it longer than about 30 minutes because I think the lime juice makes it a little tougher.  I also think I'll double the honey and zest a lime into the marinade.

I was less than impressed.  I"ve made something like this before, but without the beer and it was 100 times better.  I even marinated the chicken overnight, and it tasted incredibly bland.  I will be shredding up the remainder of the chicken to put in a casserole so it doesn't get wasted.

Quick and easy!  The chicken was juicy. We liked the flavor of the lime and beer.  I'll  add some cajun spice or something next time for some added kick.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a great recipe! We cut up a whole chicken. We used the thighs, wings and drummies with the skin on and skin off for the breast pieces (to satisfy my five year old)- both were equally tasty after being grilled! A nice light beer flavor, with a hint of lime and cilantro - nothing overpowering so it would go well with almost any side dish.

I would definitely marinate this longer than the recipe calls for. But it is very flavorful! I served it with a home-made guacamole which I spread on top of the chicken, which was great!

The flavors were very bland and had an odd taste overall.  I marinated the chicken for almost two hours. Despite not having been overcooked, the chicken turned out dry.

This was really good, but not what I was expecting. Mine marinated for a day and a half, and really the only flavor that stood out was the cilantro (which for us was a good thing because we LOVE cilantro).  It was very light, but for me needs a kick. Good for a hot summer day w/ some grilled squash.  :)

I thought this recipe was very good.  The marinating made the chicken so tender.
Chicken is a bland meat to begin with, so if you are inclined to want more taste or spicier, you will have to add your own.

I made the Avacado Feta Salsa to go with this and it was yummy!

I will be making this again!  Thanks

This was the most moist and juicy chicken i have ever had - it was delish and i will definitely make it again. I only gave it 4 stars because i agree that the flavour was a little light - i will add more garlic cilantro and lime next time and marinate it longer - then it will be a 5 star

I agree with the reader who stated that this chicken didn't have much taste. I have made MANY recipes on this site.. all were wonderful... this is the first recipe that I have tried that I would NOT make again.

It was super moist, but it didn't have much flavor.  I made it exactly as written, except that I let it marinate for about 2 hours)  and cooked it on my George Foreman grill.  It just needs something else.  I think I would use beer and lime again, but add some other seasonings.

Of course I had to mess with this. The basic recipe is great but I marinated it overnight.
I suggest serving a side of lime crema with it for those who want additional flavor.
3T mayo, 3T sour cream, 1 T fresh lime juice, salt to taste. I also used chicken tenders because they are easier to grill. High heat, lid open, grill until 3/4 opaque, then turn. Cooks quickly- under 5 minutes depending on you grill.

Ok I tried this last night as something different. The recipe was easy to follow however, the time to marinate the chicken I feel was not long enough. I suggest to marinate for 6 to 8 hours, even over night.

I was highly disappointed. I followed this exactly and there was hardly any flavor to the chicken. Definitely will not make again.

I liked the fundamental ingredients in this recipe. I think the base was good. What I used was chicken tenderloins, 12 oz of good polish beer, onion,garlic, and seasoned salt powders. I also added hot sauce to my taste. I also took the cilantro and did about 1/4 cup anymore would have been too much. I bruised and chopped the cilantro to release its flavors. Also I am not a fan of honey so I used about 1 tbsp of brown sugar loose not hard packed. I also added a bit of saffron for color and juiced a whole lime . I let everything mingle together for about 2 hours because while I wanted flavorful chicken I didn't want chicken that was too boozy tasting. I grilled it and served with a cilantro lime rice. I didn't care for the rice it was too much cilantro with the amount that was already in the chicken. For future Servings of this chicken I will make pan or oven roasted garlic potatos or a simple white rice. This chicken is outstanding, easy and flavorful.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and marinated for one hour. This was a waste of time and effort. We could barely taste the cilantro or lime.

Chicken was moist, but very bland.  It had no flavor at all.  I marinated for more than an hour.  Maybe it needs overnight, as some have suggested.  But I won't try it again.

In addition to the ingredients listed, I zested a lime and added the juice of a second one.  Doubled the garlic and eyeballed the honey (so it was probably closer to 2 tsp.)  I also added a few red pepper flakes.  I thought the chicken was juicy and tasted really nice.  The only noticeable flavor though was the chicken and a hint of lime.  Next time, I may go even heavier on the seasonings, but will hold on to the recipe.

I have to say that my family and I really enjoyed this Chicken I think that I should of marinated the chicken maybe overnight instead of just for 30 min, because then the beer and seasoning would of really soaked through the entire chicken breast.  Other then that this dish was GREAT..

I was so excited to make this, but it was a bit underwhelming.  I marinated it for 1 1/2 hours, and while juicy, there was absolutely no flavor from the beer OR the lime!  I'll try marinating it overnight next time, and adding the lime zest.

Awesome taste. Marinated overnight and made on the grill.  Even my kids ate it so I know it was good.  Added extra honey and used 2 limes.

To much beer flavor, use half and sub the other for good chicken stock. Also added some poultry seasonings. And turned out great. I cut chicken in strips and grilled. Great served with grilled vegetables with orzo

This was one of the most tender pieces of chicken I have ever eaten.  I second guessed myself as to if it was even cooked all the way.  Like other reviewers, it needed a little extra kick.  I will keep working on it but it is a great start.

I made this today...won't be making it again. It upped the recipe for 6 breasts and marinated it for about 6 hrs. The whole family thought it was blah..my kids asked for BBQ sauce to dip it in and I used it as well. I will say the chicken was very moist though.

We have been so excited to try this recipe and finally got around to it tonight.  It was absolutely delicious.  We didn't change a thing.  We served it with a side of whole wheat pasta that was drizzled in olive oil, fresh lime juice, fresh garlic, salt and pepper.  I was worried that the beer flavor would be too strong, but it wasn't.  This is a keeper for us!

Amazing, perfect for the Spring Time, very juicy, light and fresh...!  I marinated overnight so the flavors would penetrate the chicken..!  We paired with a refreshing Rose Wine form Provence..!

Not a whole lot of flavor to the chicken. I let it marinate about an hour. Maybe it would be more flavorful if it is marinated longer.

Done everything the recipe called. Basically it tasted like a plain chicken branch with a touch of cilantro. So if you like plain chicken, go for it.

I made this with spicy potato vegan curry (also from this site) the chicken looked really good, but when we tasted it we were very disappointed. There wasn't very much flavor. Definitely lacking something.

I was looking for a quick and easy marinade for chicken and this was perfect. Followed the recipe as written and it was cooked just right and wasn't overpowered by any of the flavors. I will use this again. Thanks, Lauren.

very bland...was skeptical due to the previous reviews...even added more cilantro and lime and I didn't taste any of the ingredients. The chicken came out looking beautiful but was tasteless. We ended up adding bbq sauce.

I marinated my chicken breasts for quite awhile before grilling. While going on the grill they smelled strongly of beer and lime but after cooking there really was no flavor. It did keep the chicken nice and juicy as a marinade should, but so would lots of other options (ex. salad dressing) that would also impart flavor and not waste a perfectly delicious beer. I always love trying new recipes though, thanks for sharing :)

I marinated a few hours and broiled in the oven (b/c it's winter here).  Moist and tasty, but not anything wow and unusual.  I could taste a hint of lime, and only my 8-year-old commented that he could taste beer (and this was before they knew what it was marinated in, so ???)  Would make again, but no hurry.

It was okay.  I marinated it a little longer as suggested by other reviews, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  The beer taste was a bit overpowering.  I think it would have been better with more lime and less beer.    However, it was juicy.  My husband said it was 'good', I couldn't finish mine, my 9-year old took a little prodding but did eat it, and my 6-year old nearly licked her plate, which is unusual for her.    But I probably won't make again unless I change the recipe quite a bit.

Not half bad...though not as good as I hoped. It turned out a little dryer than I expected it too. Maybe that was because of the beer. I might try it again sometime.

LOVE THIS MARINADE!  I put everything together as instructed (used Labatt Blue Light for the beer) & then added in an extra clove of garlic, plus about a tsp of garlic powder.  I cubed my chicken (because I was making shish kabobs), punctured a few spots on the breasts so that the flavors could really get in there and mixed it into the marinade, then let it sit in the fridge for 5 hours.  It came out sooo tender and tasty!!!  Lauren, thank you for such a great & easy way to make some yummy chicken!  :)

I used this to make kabobs the other night on the grill, and it was very easy and very good, but its a subtle flavor. The chicken did come out super tender and very juicy. I think next time I may keep the marinade and reduce it for coating when the kabobs are served.

This was an awesome chicken recipe!! The chicken was very, very moist and full of yummy flavor! The only small changes I made was I added a bit more honey (and still couldn't really tell it was in the flavors of the chicken), but I also added extra juice from one lime, and a little extra cilantro because I love the extra punch it adds. This is definitely a recipe that doesn't need tinkering with, it works, it's super easy, and the taste will knock your socks off!!

My whole family of 6 enjoyed this chicken. I omitted the cilantro (we just don't like it) and added chili powder during cooking, then some fresh lime juice before eating. It was very good, and we will use the leftovers in fajitas.

I followed all directions and felt this was rather mild in taste.  I expected more zip to the chicken after the marinade.  If I use this recipe again I will increase amount of lime, honey and garlic.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband made me make him more for today!!!  We both loved it.  I used lime light beer and also squeezed the lime as well.  Used more cilantro because I love it added more poltury spices and pepper flakes (husband loves heat in his food). I made it on my panini press and it was still great! Will be keeping this for a long time to come!!!

My family loved this.  I followed recipe exactly as written, however, I ended up marinating chicken for about 2 hours.  The chicken was moist and juicey.  This will definitely be a staple in our house!

The lime flavor wasn't as intense and flavorful as I wanted; perhaps it needed more salt? not to mention the acid from the ingredients pre-cooks the chicken I found it made my chicken breasts small

I didn't have the cilantro on hand so I omitted it. It was still very moist and tender even on the grill. I did find that we needed an extra splash of lime with a touch of salt to really give it some great flavor. Overall a pretty decent recipe.

Oh, this is HEAVENLY. One of my family's new favorites! If you remember in time marinate it overnight, but as little as 30 minutes will still do the trick. We add a little more cilantro and garlic, and top the finished chicken with cilantro from the garden. Amazing.

Sorry,but this taste combo just didn't work for me or my family. The beer gave it a weird "off",almost sour taste,combined with the chicken and cilantro. I do cook with beer and it always brings the flavor of the food out with it,but not this time. I also love cilantro,but added all together somehow just didn't work out.I won't make it again...sorry.

Very good. I marinated the chicken overnight I added a little more garlic, some onion powder, the whole lime cut up and a splash of hot sauce. Very moist and tender.

I was only marinating two breasts so I only used half of a bottle of beer, but I used an entire lime juiced and half of a lemon juiced.  I used dried cilantro and dried basil, and left the marinade for about an hour before I grilled it.  The result was extremely juicy and flavorful chicken.  It was great warm the night it was cooked, and i added it to a cold pasta salad, and that was great too.

I was worried after reading other reviews, so I put extra honey, lime and garlic in marinade.  Turned out pretty good.  The chicken looked a bit bare when I put in on the grill so I sprinkled a bit of paprika and lemon pepper seasoning to it.  My husband said it tasted great.

Fabulous!  My family is very picky and they loved this.  I figured I would get some ew grosses about the cilantro being stuck to it but noone said a word, they just inhaled it.  I am still recovering from the surprise.

I found the same results as other reviewers - while the chicken was moist, I'm not convinced that it was due to the marinade; additionally the marinade contributed little if any flavor to the dish.  I won't be making this again.

It was pouring rain outside, so I decided to bake the chicken in a glass dish, soaking in about a quarter-inch of the marinade at the bottom. I sprinkled some paprika on top for a little color- it turned out GREAT! Very flavorful and moist. A good way to dress up baked chicken breast.

Changed the marinade recipe by adding onion slices. Put the breasts in the marinade overnight. Result was an exceptionally moist chicken breast BUT it did not have discernable flavoring from the marinade - that's the only negative.

I used split chicken breasts and marinated about 45 minutes. I added a bit more honey,juiced an extra lime,and added cumin  The chicken breasts browned nicely. The skin absorbed the flavor and the meat had a somewhat bland taste. Next time, I'll brine or marinate longer if using split breasts again, and add kosher salt. With boneless breasts, marinating much longer than 45 minutes might make the meat mushy.

This was just OK.  I let the chicken marinate for 4 hours and when I tasted it after grilling it tasted like plain old chicken.  I even upped the amount of garlic.  I think maybe it needs olive oil or something to make it stick better to the chicken.

Excellent subtle flavor overall. The meat was very tender. Next time, I'll use more lime juice and honey. I used dried cilantro and it's flavor was more subtle - the way that we like it, since we don't like strong cilantro flavor.

I usually slice up the chicken into 1-2 cm strips before marinating for a couple of hours, otherwise the inside of the chicken doesn't see the light of day or marinade.

It then BBQ's faster, so you need higher heat (flash fry) if you want grill marks. And as others say, it is a very mild marinade. Adding lime zest would help (as someone mentioned).

I followed the recipe, plus added in a little chili powder, cumin, and chipotle pepper powder for extra flavor. Chicken was moist and flavorful. I can see how not adding a bit more spices could have made it a bit on the bland side or just taste like beer.

The flavor is subtle, but very enjoyable, and a different flavor than the usual spicing. I double (or tripled) the garlic and added some sriracha for a little kick. I'll add this one to the rotation.

Chicken was moist, but very bland. Tasted like we just plopped the chicken on the grill with no seasoning. Maybe a longer marinade time would help.  Rating as 2 stars because it wasn't inedible.

We LOVE this. Made as described with one major change - we used dark meat (leg/thigh quarters). I think the dark meat takes on flavors better than white and isn'tdry when grilled.

This dish was ok, rather bland but simplistic. My family ate it but it was not one of the best recipes I've made. If I make this again I would increase the flavor by adding the zest of the lime along with the juices and increase the garlic & cilantro. To finish the chicken I would cut a lime in half and grill it to release the juice and increase its flavor & sweetness, then squeeze it onto the chicken before serving with some fresh cilantro.

It was OK, nothing more. Perhaps it was because I used frozen chicken breasts. Next time I will try fresh.

Beer Lime Grilled Chicken Haiku: "Found a half of beer, chose to make this recipe. It was just alright." My husband left a Larry (our term for an opened, unfinished beer) out so I decided to halve this recipe for the remaining beer, along w/ 2 chicken breasts. Marinated for 4 hrs. and didn't change a thing about the recipe. Honestly, it just didn't taste like much at all. I think it needs more garlic, lime juice and/or zest, and maybe more honey too. It's Spring and I'm ready to grill just about anything, so thanks for the new recipe!

I cut the chicken on chunks and let it marinade about 8 hours.  I added a bit of extra honey and garlic.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This was more of a 3.5 for me.  It smelled wonderful, but it just didn't seem to have much flavor to it.  I left it marinating for 3-4 hours, but it still didn't seem to be enough.  May make it again, may not, I'm not sure yet.

We liked the flavor of this marinade and was glad to find something different for chicken. I was getting tired of soy or teriyaki based marinade's. The combination of lime, beer and honey was very tasty and the chicken came out juicy and flavorful. I used dried cilantro because I didn't have fresh on hand I will use fresh the next time. Thank You for sharing.

I made this, using frozen skinless boneless chicken thighs. I forgot to put honey in and I also added a chopped jalapeno. I heated up the marinade in the microwave and poured it over the meat, then stuck it in a Ziploc bag. After it thawed, I put in the fridge for a couple of hours. It came out delicious on the grill.

This was a great recipe. I only had a 1/2 lime so I added some margarita mix and some dice jalapeno peppers and dried chili powder for an extra kick. The breasts came off the grill very tender and juicy. Next time I will grill a bigger batch and shred it for burritos.

This recipe is very tasty. I used 3/4 of lime, 1 teaspoon of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of honey, 1 can of light beer and salt, pepper and cilantro to desired amount. I used these ingredients for 8 thin-sliced chicken breasts, and accidentally let the chicken marinate for 55 minutes. All turned out wonderful, I cooked each side for about 7-9 minutes and the chicken came out tender, juicy and tasty. Both my husband and I liked the taste, the texture and the aroma. I will be repeating this again. Thank you!!

The chicken was pretty tasty. I didn't have cilantro so I used parsley instead. I could tell that the cilantro would have definitely added a great flavor to it. I would use it again. It was super easy!!

Chicken turned out bland. Maybe if I marinated it overnight like some other people, it would have been more tasty. Nice to eat on a summer day!

Andy wasn't a huge fan of this, but I think marinating overnight would make all the difference in the world. Next time be more exact with the beer and the cilantro.

The flavors in this dish sounded great, but actually was bland. I will probably try it again, but will definitely pump up the lime, garlic, and honey, and use a darker more flavorful beer rather than a light beer.

Followed the recipe pretty closely but cut back a bit on the honey and increased the lime.  Loved the flavor! Cooked two breasts and two boneless thighs. Seemed like the breasts had more flavor than the thighs.  I also marinated about 10 hours. We will be making this one again, and I appreciate you sharing!

On a positive note, the chicken was moist very moist but flavor wise seemed bland. I think this is a good base but definitely next time I will add fresh herbs and a lot more salt.

Made this recipe tonight. I didn't have light beer, so I used hefeweizen beer. I didn't have cilantro so I used an herb blend and added a little red pepper oil. It was fantastically flavorful, tender chicken. My daughter walked in the house and asked what smelled so good! I will absolutely make it again, many times over!

I found it surprisingly bland, and that was after marinating for about 4 hours! I'll make it again, but maybe add quite a bit more garlic and cilantro, and a little more salt.

Excellent base recipe for marinating fresh chicken breasts. Used a quality light colored hoppy beer. Garlic salt instead of regular salt, minced sweet banana pepper from the garden, and doubled the cilantro & honey. Totally left out the garlic & marinated for over an hour turning the bag several times. Grilled slowly over medium heat while basting the chicken often with the marinade. Liked the flavor of this extremely moist chicken.  Definitely a keeper & easy to modify based on what you have in the garden/kitchen.

I did this with one difference in the marinade. The next time you buy the limes pop a couple in the freezer. When you go to use them instead of just cutting them in half and squeezing the juice out you will now be able to zest the frozen lime into the marinade. Amazing lime flavor and you get all the vitamins in the pealing as well. I also marinaded the chicken for about 4 hours. The marinade can be made ahead of time (the night before) and just kept in a sealed container in the refrigerator.

I thought this marinade was ok. The chicken skin burned badly, but thats more or less the operator error not the marinade. The chicken under the burned skin was good and tender and the flavor was good. My husband on the other hand hated it.

Great, refreshing flavor! Perfect for summer. I marinated for an hour instead of 30 minutes. I was too lazy to mince garlic, so I just used garlic powder. I'm sure it'll be even better with the real stuff. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy dinner.  I used a dark beer (home brew), and the chicken has a very rich flavor.  Wonderful with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes!

The chicken was juicy, but I thought the flavor was a little blah...  I will add more spices next time to kick it up a little.

Loved it.  I used heineken light, bottled lime juice, and ground coriander instead of cilantro.  I also used the George Foreman grill cause we were out of propane and it turned out fine!

I reccomend replacing the beer with black russian vodka, makes for a stronger more prominent flavor. Not a bad taste overall though.

Made this for dinner tonight for me and my husband. As others have said there is not much flavour but I served the chicken with salsa on top and I found the salsa really brought out the flavor in the chicken. Probably won't make again.

Sooo yummy. I passed on this recipe to my husband to make since it involves a grill. I LOVED it. I added extra lime on top of mine once it was done cooking. I can never just eat something "as is" I always have to add something such as BBQ sauce, lime or lemon juice to give it that extra moist-ness in my mouth. :-)

I made this for my family last night and it was a MAJOR hit. My brother said it was the juiciest piece of chicken he has ever had in his life, and I must say I agree.  I varied the marinade a little bit by adding 2 tablespoons more honey and the juice from 3 limes. Also, after I put the chicken on the grill, I continued to pour the marinade over the pieces while they were cooking which added a bit more flavor.

This was a very yummy, quick marinade. I'd cut back on the salt a little next time.  The beer and cilantro flavors come through the chicken slightly and added great flavor.

This was pretty good, chicken was moist. I wasn't wowed by the flavor, however I think I will try it again with a couple changes. One, smaller pieces of chicken and two, actually grilling it on a grill. I used a grill pan, and am not sure this made a huge change. I hope the flavor will be better next time.

This chicken was good but I wish it had more flavor. I marinated it for 3 hours, which I know realize might have not been enough. I would make this again but I'd have to figure out a way to bump up the flavor so it doesn't just end up tasting like grilled chicken with a hint of lime.

This turned out very good, despite some of the reviews.  I think the secret is marinating it longer than the recipe calls for.  I marinated it for 8 hours and it was tender with great flavor..

Came out good but I was expecting more flavor.  I plan on using the chicken with some habanero lime flavored wraps and other wrap fixin's and I think they will pair well together.

Was very easy to make, but I didn't think it had a very strong flavor- I let my chicken breasts sit in the marinade for 2.5 hours and it still tasted like there was nothing extra on the chicken!

Awesome recipe!!  I followed the recipe to the tee.  I did however use frozen boneless, skinless chicken and just made the marinade and let the chicken sit in the marinade as it's unthawing.  The longer you marinade, the better the flavor.  Served with salad and baked potatoes and got rave reviews!

I've also tried with fresh spinach and parsley (in place of cilantro) and both were great. This was the best chicken we have ever tried on the grill. I gave this recipe to my best friend, and it is now on both of our weekly menu lists.

Kudos! This was healthy and scrumptious. I made it for a family barbecue and the kids were actually calling "dibs" on the leftovers.

This chicken is moist, but otherwise nothing special.  It's not difficult to make chicken moist if you cook it properly so the 3 stars is for flavor alone.  The combination of flavors good but there is just something missing.  There seems to be too much beer, I think you could cut it in half and keep the rest of the ingredients the same.  Perhaps then the flavor of the garlic could be appreciated.

Not very flavorful, I followed the recipe to the T and it just fell sorta flat. I think it may need some more marinating time but I probably won't be trying this recipe again.

I used Labatt Blue beer for this recipe . . I probably should have used more lime juice. I let marinate for about 3 hours. I just didn't get the flavor I was hoping for. It was ok. . . but I won't make it again.

I used one bottle of Carona Light, 2 limes, about 2 tbs. honey, S&P, 4 large cloves of garlic (crushed), and 5 chicken drumsticks (which started out frozen and thawed in the marinade). They marinated for about 3 hours. The flavor was really good but the lime juice "cooked" the chicked partially and I dont like what that did to the texture. Next time I will marinate for only 2 hours. Oh, and the grill was not working well so I put it in the over at 375 for about 30 min then finished under the broiler for another 5. I service it will mashed potatoes, corn, and a garlic/lime sauce (olive oil, fresh garlic, lime juice, salt, and just a splash of chicken stock pureed in the blender - SO GOOD!)

Made it for Memorial Day to celebrate a friend's baptism.  Very tender, but flavors were not prominent...HOWEVER, my friend suggested shaking some salt over the cooked chicken and this brought out the beer/lime taste.  Would cook this again and someone at the party asked for the recipe!!!

I did not care for this recipe what so ever! I agree the chicken was tender and moist. However,  I followed the recipe to a T and all I could taste was beer and cilantro.  :( Not a fan! Very dissappointed. I was so looking forward to this also!!

I didn't think this was that great. The flavor was fine, but there wasn't enough flavor. I prefer more flavorful marinades. I have one I use with olive oil and rosemary and more garlic that is way more flavorful than this one.

Made this last night in the oven with the broiler and it turned out just wonderful. After reading reviews, I marinated it 45 minutes in the fridge. It jumped to my second most favorite chicken recipe ever. (First is crunchy french-fried onion chicken.) This is a keeper and I'll ask hubby to cook it on the grill when it's not so windy!

This was very tender and juicy. I liked that part. The flavor was rather bland for me, though. I will take this idea of marnanting in beer, which I did overnight and use it with some spicier ingredients

Very good, moist with nice flavor. I added more cilantro (personal preference). Next time I will also add some spice, I think some chipolte in adobo make a good addition (too bad I can't even spell it well enough for spell check to correct it :-)  Be careful on the marinade time. I Let mine go for 3 hrs. I don't think I would want to go more than that or the lime juice will make it mushy.

It was very juicy.  I did have to cook it longer but I was also using a George Foreman Grill.  It still turned out excellent for my taste!!

Loved it!  So simple and delicious.  Marinated the chicken for about 10 hours...the combination of lime, garlic and cilantro was wonderful.  Added it to a salad and served with Southwest dressing.  A new favorite.

i followed the directions exactly . seemed like the only thing i really tasted was the cilantro. i thought it was alright besides being overcooked because the pieces were cut in half. but my husband did not like it at all. just allright for me.

The recipe was ok, but it did lack flavor.  I marinaded the chicken overnight because I really wanted the beer flavor to come out.  I would like to try again with a darker beer to see if the flavor soaks into the chicken more.

I was a little nervous to try this recipe as I was serving it to my young children. I increase the honey from 1 tsp to 1/4 cup to make the flavor more appealing to my children. One of my girls did taste the beer flavor. I tasted it as well and was not a big fan of it. My husband did like the taste of the chicken. I marinated the skewers for a couple of hours and I kept on basting the skewers while they were on the grill.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly but the chicken turned out to be juicy and have good flavor.  I used approx. 1 cup Newman's Lime dressing (not exact name but it's the only lime vinaigrette Newman's Own makes), half a bottle of beer (I don't care for the beer taste to be too strong), and two cloves minced garlic. I just marinated the chicken breasts in this mixture for and hour and then grilled. Quick and pretty good, considering I was improvising.

I've made this several times now, both with bonelss chicken breasts and chicken tenderloins.   For me utilizing the chicken breasts and marinating overnight have provided for the more flavorful and juicy finished product.  I also have added some citrus herb seasoning to the recipe to further enhance the lime.

Have gotten great feedback even from those people who are not beer drinkers.

Not my favorite but my husband loves it,  so I am sure I will be making again!  The beer flavor is really all I tasted.  I tried it again a few weeks later and this time added Chubb's Chili Lime rub right before we threw it on the grill and I still only tasted the beer.  My husband loved it even more the second time with the added spices.

Didn't love the recipe.  The beer taste was strong (I marinated it overnight).  Ok, but I've had a lot better grilled chicken.  This was a bit bland and not as tender as other similar recipes I've made.

Absolutely delicious chicken. I tweaked it a little. Instead of using cilantro I used dried Italian seasoning and only 1 tablespoon. Also after marinating I sprinkled all of them with "poultry magic" seasoning. Absolutely delicious. Definitely will make again. Just a suggestion. I served it with couscous and spinach. Very good.

Unlike most other "beer" related recipes I've had, the beer taste didn't totally cook off, which is bad for me as I'm not a fan. I think next time I'll nix the beer and just use my favorite lime salad dressing as a marinade.

I just got up from the dinner table. I used this chicken for chicken tacos and it was good. I looked at some of the other comments and used 2 large garlic cloves, a large lime and onion chopped up plus some extra onion powder along with some cayenne pepper and hot pepper flakes. I also used a generous amount of salt and pepper. I used it on the Costco flash frozen skinless boneless breast and it was perfect in a taco.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The marinade made the chicken very juicy, but you should definitly marinate it for at least a few hours for all the flavors to come out. Leftovers make great chicken salad!

Add avacado feta salsa ontop of this chicken (after cooked) and then it's perfect.  The chicken alone is ok, but the spice that everyone says is missing ... well thats it!

I used more seasoning than what the recipe called for and marinated it for 24 hours otherwise chicken is bland.  I served this chicken with Avocado Feta Salsa and it was outstanding!

Nice and juicy but I thought it would have a bit more flavor.  Will use this recipe again but will add more seasoning next time and much more lime juice - I think that the beer totally voided out the lime and cilantro.

Very good, flavorful chicken. Marinated it for a little over an hour. Used Peroni Beer (Itlaian, ~100cals, lightly dry) and was delighted with the results. I'll have to make this again in the near future.

This recipe looked good on paper but didn't work out too well. The marinade gave the chicken very little flavor, despite letting it marinade all day. Perhaps I did something wrong, but it wasn't worth wasting a good beer on.

The chicken was a bit dry. Maybe it works better with chicken pieces on the bone, and with a longer marinading time. Some olive oil in the marinade might help. I doubt I'd make this again.

This chicken wasn't very flavorful at all.  I did make one change and maybe that was the problem...I didn't have fresh cilantro and used fresh parsley instead.  My family did not care for it all.  It was very good the next day in a salad, though.  I don't think I'll be making this again, however.

Really good!  Did add extra garlic and used frozen cilantro.  Could marinate a little longer maybe 45-60 min.  But great and will make again.

Not sure how I felt about this one...my husband really liked it, so I may have to give it another try.  I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours, so there was flavor, just not sure I liked it though.

Maybe I didn't let this sit long enough to flavor the chicken.  I just couldn't taste it.  This was okay and interesting to try but I don't think this is a top ten-er.

I thought this had potential, but it's not quite there as it is.  I used an amber ale to add a little bit more flavor.  I grilled it in a cast iron pan, piling on cilantro from the marinade, and the cilantro ended up being crispy and seared onto it, which was good, but I wish I could've tasted the cilantro more.  I think it needs something else, but I don't know what.  My husband's suggestion was to fillet the chicken breast, then put the two pieces back together with cilantro piled in the middle.  Maybe I'll try that next time.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was just okay.  I increased the amount of honey to 1 TB and added additional garlic and sliced onions (I used tecate beer).  Then I marinated the chicken all day.  The chicken was tender, but lacked flavor.  My husband makes a similar recipe (Key West Chicken) that calls for basically the same ingredients, plus soy sauce.  I think that may be the kick this recipe needs.

It was very good! Tender, moist, and full of flavor. Unfortunately for me it still tasted like beer, which I didn't enjoy overly, but my family LOVED it, and immediately requested to have it again!

The flavor was fine, but mild.  I would use again for chicken to be mixed in pasta or a salad...but as a stand alone...I did not prefer.

Only ok. I marinated for the 45 minutes to 1 hour, but I think it really needs to sit overnight for more flavor. The little flavor it did have was good though, I would try again, and let it sit longer.

This was OK, we used a whole chicken and basted over low heat hoping to spice up the flavor, but it still lacked flavor, maybe adding some soy would help.
