Great recipe for a light chocolate cake. I did not make the peach filling, and iced it with a butter cream icing, but the cake part of this recipe is exactly what I was looking for!!!
  My kids ate it up and all wanted more.  EASY EASY EASY AND GREAT RESULTS!  (it's very similar to making a cake with applesauce instead of oil)

Excellent! I doubled up the recipe and made two cakes, no leftovers!! Everyone asked for the recipe when they heard there were beets in it. I couldnt find unsalted beets so I just used regular and didnt notice a difference. One thing I would change is instead of puree the peaches, just slightly blend them so it is a bit more of a chunky texture. Other then that,  there is nothing I would change. Will be making this for the next birthday!!

I am only rating the frosting, filling and raspberries and how they combine with the chocolate/beet cake flavor. For the cake itself, I used the Beet Surprise Cake from this site (I wanted a from scratch cake with fresh beets). OMG! Amazingly good flavor combo. All my guests had seconds -- and big second pieces.
