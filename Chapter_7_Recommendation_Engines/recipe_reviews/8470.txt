I am not a huge fruitcake fan myself, but a close friend is and I gave this recipe to her. She insisted that I try some of the cake, and she raved abotu the exceptional taste and flavor. To me, the cake tasted the same as all the other fruitcakes I had encountered. I think that if you are really a fruitcake lover and are looking for a wonderful recipe, you've met your match. However, if you really don't like fruitcake, don't expect this recipe to work miracles. This cake is nothing special unless you especially love fruitcake.

Good recipe and instructions.  I would make this again.  My only suggestion is to put the booze in the cake, rather than just soaking a cheese cloth and wrappu g the cake.
