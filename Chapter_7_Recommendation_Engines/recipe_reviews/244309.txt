Love the flavor of this recipe. The only advice I would give is to get the smallest tortillas you can find, otherwise the burger gets kind of lost in it. I think we used 8 inch ones -- if I can't find smaller next time, I will trim them down a little bit before using.

Hubby loved this, "Better than a big bun."     I did the tortillas in a cast iron pan on the stove, melted the cheese etc...., placed the hamburger patty on one quarter, loaded it up and folded in fourths.   It worked well.  Thanks!

These burgers were bomb! I loved the southwest sauce, we even made extra for our onion rings and fries.

Outstanding recipe. Thank you for sharing and for the helpful reviews. I made it indoors without a grill but otherwise as is. My sirloin burgers I rubbed with olive oil and sea salt & pepper. I cooked them in a skillet 5 mins each side. So juicy and delicious! The southwest ranch here is delicious. I heated my tortillas in another skillet as instructed. Put it all together, and now the family wants to know when we’re having them again!

Love them at restaurants and loved them at home! Next time I think I’ll try adding bacon and sautéed onions. I know, it takes away from the Quesadilla idea, but it sounds good.

A very nice twist on hamburgers!  Take the advice of others and use smaller sized tortillas.

Four Stars for the sauce and overall taste of the dish.   The overall concern is how do you make this so the sauce and burger don't slide out, and if you use the large tortillas, they are too large.   I read all of the reviews and looked at all the pictures and was trying to get this one right.  Sadly I did not succeed.  I went with trimming the large tortillas down and used two per burger as the recipe calls for.  It was a gooey mess that was very tasty.  Next time around I will make it with one large tortilla, fold the edges over and pin it with a tooth pick like I have seen in one of the pictures.

We made these with home made tortillas and my family LOVED them. My pickiest eater even ate two! Thanks for sharing! Yum!
