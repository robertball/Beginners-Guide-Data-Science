I have never made quiche before and was very pleased with the results.  The only ingredient I did not include were the mushrooms.  It had a great consistency, kept its shape and didn't fall apart.  It was very tasty!  Thank you!

I haven't met too many quiches I didn't like but I thought this was a little better than most, I think, due to the sour cream.  My husband had to ask if there were eggs in it.  I could not find wild rice so ended up using another whole grain, dark colored rice called Forbidden Rice. I'm really not sure the rice added anything to the dish so you could easily substitute a chopped vegetable.

I love this quiche, and have found that even people who SAY they don't like quiche will gobble this up!  I usually just mix the cheese right in with the other ingredients and it turns out beautifully every time.  I've used ham and chicken both with great results.

YUMMY! My whole family LOVED this recipe! This was my first quiche & it was fantastic. For taste preferences, I left out the Dijon mustard & subbed shredded mozzarella for the Swiss. I'm excited to make this again!

This quiche was a big hit for my family's leftover Christmas ham. I would prefer not to have the rice in there, just because there is already a lot of starch with the dough and it's filling as is. I suggest, skip the rice and steam some vegetables to have on the side instead.

This recipe was wonderful!  Now, I had to make a few substitutions (Uncle Bens long grain and wild rice, green pepper, cheddar cheese) but everything turned out fantastic.  I did broil the top for a couple minutes but that's just how we like it.  Please don't hesitate to try this as you will not be dissappointed.  Thanks Sue for submitting!

Yummy!  Definitely enough filling for two pies, so make double and freeze the second one.  I'm not sure if I cooked it long enough because even though the knife came out clean, it had a lot of liquid and I ended up throwing it back in the oven for another 25 minutes the second time we ate it.  I will make it again though!

Very tasty, and a nice change from the typical ham/cheese or spinach/cheese recipes.  I substituted yogurt for the sour cream as I always do in recipes with no trouble here.  Since I wasn't exact on my measurements, I had trouble keeping the filling to only one pie, so I used a second crust - and now I have another dinner ready (yeah for me!).  One thing: when baking an empty pie crust, place an empty tin inside of it to keep it from wilting as it bakes - I learned.  I definitely will be recommending this recipe to my friends.

Wild rice cooks up easily if you can find good quality hand-parched rice which is nicely done and fluffy in 20 minutes.  
 I garnished the quiche with 8 thin slices of red bell pepper set as spokes in a wheel so that each serving would have a decorative touch.  This is fantastic for a nice brunch....and it is versatile.  Try it with sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, chives, feta cheese, or whatever suits your tastes.  Thank you for your recipe.

Very cheesy and a lot of veggies flavor.  I made the following modification based on what I had in my refrigerator: Salmon, instead of ham, green pepper, white onion (uncooked), fresh mushroom, and colby cheese.  Baked approx 35 min (a bit longer).  By using the 9" shallow crust, this made 2 plates.  Also, I used 1/2 cup of wild rice (used Minnesota Roasted Wild Rice, love the texture!), so the filling was plenty for 2 batches.  Colby cheese was a bit less flavor to me, so next time, I would use cheddar, and perhaps, would add spinach or black olive.  The base is very good, so I think you can make your own with your choice of veggies or meat!

Enjoyed the quiche although not over fond of the mustard, next time I will leave this out.  I made two smaller quiches instead of the one large.  I did bake for a little longer than stated.

This dish was fantastic, everyone in my family loved it. I didn't add the rice, it just didn't make sense to me. I made roasted asparagus on the side, it was yummy!

This is a VERY GOOD recipe!! I used uncle ben's long grain  and wild rice. I could tell just looking at the recipe it was going to be something special, in fact i made it for my boyfriend's birthday recently and he loved it. it's alittle rich with the pie crust and custard, but very good, will be making again soon.

This is the "bomb". My family really enjoyed this and can't wait to make it again. We changed the serving size to 8 to accommodate our needs and the only issue was the middle not quite firming up enough to hold together but that wasn't much of a problem. Two thumbs up !

Fantastic!  I went wrong with the cooking of the wild rice somewhere along the way, it came out underdone, but once I get that figured out this will definitely be one of the staple after-the-holiday recipes (good way to use up that holiday ham).

This was really good! The wild rice gives it a nice texture and flavor while the red pepper gives it some zing.  My famliy loves it and I have taken to 2 brunches where it met with rave reviews.  This is WAY better than your standand ham & cheese quiche!

I liked the sour cream as an alternative filler but I did not care for the rice in the quiche.  My husband ate it but agreed.

Quick and easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Next time, I would only use 1/2 a bell pepper and chop it finely.

My family gobbled this up! Only change I made was to sauté the mushrooms in some evo and a bit of butter first and subbed brown rice for wild rice as it is what I had handy. Yummy. Made 2 more fairly quickly after the first one

This is a very tasty recipe.  I did find, however, that it made way too much for one 9" pie crust.  I quickly cooked a second one, added one more egg and some extra cheese and got two very yummy quiches for the price of one!  Will definitely make it again.  I did use some smoked black pepper I had on hand and it was great.  Think some cayenne would be nice too.

This is great. The ham and wild rice go great together to make a nice, wholesome, smoky flavored quiche. mmm

It was very good. I used Broccoli instead of peppers and ommitted the mushrooms. I also used fat free sour cream and half of the cheese to reduce the fat!

Excellent leftover ham recipe.  I also did not use the wild rice and I used a combo of Parmeasan and Cheddar cheese and it was great.  I sprinkled some fresh chopped Italian parsley on top and used fresh sauted mushrooms.  Will make this again for brunch as we enjoyed it for dinner tonight with a salad.

Loved it. Rice is a nice touch. It blends in to the point that it disappears but makes a firm and filling meal.

I love this recipe! I doubled it, leaving out the crust, and making it in a larger quiche dish. It cooked in the same amount of time, and turned out beautifully. I had to mix some Italian cheeses into my Swiss, and used leeks instead of green onions. But the basic recipe, using sour cream, makes it very smooth and tasty. I will definitely make it again, perhaps using more and different veggies. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this several times.  I use black rice (can't find wild rice locally)  and it works nicely.  The combo of sour cream and swiss cheese is yummy. Other cheeses would be good as well. This is delicious straight from the oven and better the next day. This also freezes well for  quick meals.

It was pretty good actually.  I liked the wild rice in there.  My wife thought it might have been a little too much cheese, but I thought it was good that way.

Great recipe. I added some Italian seasoning and made a few substitutions to use what I had on hand, like a cheddar blend instead of Swiss cheese and stone ground mustard instead of Dijon mustard.. I liked the texture that the wild rice added.

It was delicious.  My girls don't like mushrooms so I made theirs with lightly steamed broccoli.  I used fresh mushrooms and steamed them first to avoid the added liquid when baking.  I also omitted 1/2 cup of sour cream to reduce the calories and added 1 additional egg.  The rice was a great touch!

I thought this was a very good recipe.  Be sure to follow the directions on your wild rice container.  I followed the recipe and I burnt my first batch of wild rice.  I followed the directions on the bag and it turned out good.

I did make some changes-- added more onion, some radish sprouts that needed using, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I also mixed all the cheese into the egg mixture (and added an extra egg). Probably should've put some of that cheese as crust lining-- got a bit soggy. Had to bake an extra 10 min to firm up filling. Good flavors though-- hint of the mustard. Agree with another reviewer that I don't see what the rice adds (not a fan actually).

This is one of the best quiche recipes I have ever made/had.  It has been met with rave reviews by everyone I've served it to.  The only changes I made were to sautée fresh mushrooms, (vs. using canned muchsrooms), leave out the salt (ham is salty enough on its own), lessen the eggs by one and decrease the sour cream to 3/4 of a cup as it will overflow with the quantities as called for and finally to use a deep dish pie crust.   Lundberg Wild Rice (available at Costco) is the perfect rice to use.  Thanks, Sue S...This one is a keeper!!

Used shredded cheddar instead.  I do not believe this recipe calls for enough water for cooking the rice as it was dry in only 20 minutes.  I would not add any salt (if I ever make this again) as there is already enough salt in the ham.  Also, for some reason I had to bake it longer because the filling did not want to firm up.

I didn't have swiss so instead used cheddar (and cut the amount to 1 1/2 cups).  Very good and will make this again.

I bought two 9 inch pie crusts and the ham/rice/veggies in this  recipe was plenty for both pie crusts so I reserved half and scrambled three more eggs.  The only real change I made was to saute 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms rather than using the canned stuff.  Very good!  I liked it a little better with some dashes of hot sauce, not sure I would include any in the egg mix though.

This turned out really well.  We had a ton of leftover spiral sliced ham, and tried this quiche.  Other than increasing the ingredients a little bit (I had a bigger pan and more crust to fill), I kept exactly to the recipe.  Everyone liked it, even the mustard-haters.  The pre-cooked crust is nice and flaky, and the filling tastes great.

I'm from Minnesota, where wild rice is plentiful & a new recipe is always welcome.  This is really yummy.  I like to serve it with a white sauce, ladled lightly over the top of individual servings of this quiche.  "Canoe" brand also makes precooked wild rice.  It's in a can in the rice aisle.  Don't knock it 'til you try it.....it's got a great consistency for soups and egg dishes, is not at all mushy, and is a HUGE time saver. Drain out all of the liquid well before using.  Raw wild rice is delicious, but takes a very long time to cook out all of the "crunch".   I prefer it to be a bit on the softer side, especially for soups  & recipes like this.  I think it's best when the grains are "popped", curled a bit, and are lighter brown in color.  Thanks for the delicious addition to my collection!

First quiche ate and made within 15 yrs, and I liked it. Liked it alot. Made according to recipe, but used Uncle Ben's wild rice medley instead.  Could not really notice the rice as only a 1/4 cup.  Nice change in meal rotation and good to eat anytime.

I loved this dish. I'm giving it a four because I added artichokes that I sauted with shallot and garlic instead of the mushrooms. It was very good, but pretty differet from the recipe. I also omited the rice to cut down on prep time. I was a little leary of the egg sour cream mixture, but it came out perfectly. It had a nice consistancy. I will be making it again as written.

Tasted a bit more eggy than the quiche we are used to, but it will be repeated.
