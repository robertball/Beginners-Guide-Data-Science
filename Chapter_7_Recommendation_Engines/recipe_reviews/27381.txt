Absolutely lovely.  I enjoy most things with molasses in it, and this is no exception.  I added maybe a 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, used only 3/4 cup of milk, (otherwise, I think, the dough may have been too soft too roll out) and rolled them out approximately 1/2-inch thick.  Recipe made 18 scones, so I think the dough could be rolled out a little thicker, as it doesn't rise in the oven. He-Who-Had-Sleepy-Seeds-in-His-Eyes liked waking up to the aroma of these and greatly enjoyed them with his British tea blend!  Thank you, Karen, for this submission.  I will be making these again!

These scones were very good. The dough turned out EXACTLY as scone dough should be. I definately reccomend this recipe.

These taste very good and are simple to make. They are almost bread-like, the dough comes out quite soft and a bit elastic. I used granulated sugar because I hadn't any superfine and I didn't know what mixed spice was, so I used pumpkin pie spice. I also put raw sugar on the top before baking. They are good plain, with butter, and with apple butter. I will make these again. They will travel very well.

If I could rate 0 I would. These were so soft I couldnt even shape them. I only used 1/2 cup of milk and didnt want to add extra flour or it would dilute the flavor. So I smooshed it into a big circle and cut into 12 pieces. Wasnt anywhere near done in 10 min. am still waiting, but will most likely be having toast for brkfast

My scones turned out great. Not too sweet, and a good crumb. I would recommend adding in part of the milk, mixing, and then adding in the rest of the milk. Mine were the correct consistency with just a cup of milk.

Taste is okay but with all that cream of tartar they dry out too quickly.  Some adjustment necessary in liquids.   Might play around with this and try to avoid using cream of tartar..........going to search my files for another recipe.
