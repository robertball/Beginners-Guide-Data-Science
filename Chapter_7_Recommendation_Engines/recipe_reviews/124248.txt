Great recipe that is very versatile.  I used fresh asparagus, regular diced onion instead of green onion, celery soup instead of mushroom soup and light sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  I also used an entire red pepper (diced) and probably two cups of fresh mushrooms.  I combined and sauteed all the veggies together with the chicken rather than layering them separately, and piled the whole conglomerate over the rice.  Also thinned the sauce down with water.  It was yummy!

I added more mushrooms, par boiled fresh asparagus,substituted creme of chicken and added more milk to the mayo,soup mixture.  I also used organic brown rice,instead of white rice, and added garlic powder to the veg mixture.  The green onions were great and fresh lemon juice made for a nice taste.  It was a great recipe.  I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN.

This was a very tasty dish, the pepper and onions gave it have a southwestern taste. We used fresh asparugus. Next time, because we will be making it again, we will use spanish rice,add green chiles, use sour cream instead of mayo and kick in some extra spices, we like things with a little heat!!

I really liked the versatility of this recipe.  I made it for a large family party and everyone really enjoyed it, but of course I would have changed a few things.  I think the asparagus, as well as the other vegetables, could have been marinated and I think the rice needs some more zing (cook with chicken broth and seasonings maybe).  Next time I'm going to add some broc.

We did not like this at all. I only used half the onion it called for but because it wasn't cooked before going into the oven, it was overpowering. I won't make this again.

I am so glad I tried this recipe! Like many others, I used fresh asparagus. I omitted the chicken and substituted the red pepper for a broccoli head. I didn't think I would like the mayo in it, but it actually gives it a very pleasant taste. This is a quick recipe to make, especially if you do all the prep work ahead of time. And the best is that my son didn't even realize he was eating vegetables until he was almost finished his meal!! I will definitely make this again.

I really liked this one but my husband didn't care for it at all.  I found it to be good comfort food and liked the creamy sauce.  The only thing is the asparagus took a while to cook and ended up being very limp; I think I'll use fresh asparagus if I make it again.

Great recipe!  Very tasty.  I subbed cream of broccoli soup and sour cream for mayo.  Also sauteed all veggies with chicken like one reviewer suggested.  Defintiely will make again, maybe with more chicken next time.

I fixed this recipe for lunch for me and my husband.  I did make a few changes.  I used fresh aspargus.  I cut it into 1 inch pieces and sauted it in olive oil and Paula Deen's house seasoning for about 3 minutes.  I also used the same oil and house seasoning to cook the chicken and vegetables.  I added half a can of milk to the sauce to thin it down a bit.  It was good, but I will experiment with seasonongs for more flavor.  Maybe a can of Cream of Chicken and Mushroom Soup and a little garlic and herbs.

I did not care for this AT ALL! I don't know if it was the mayo. in it or what. I ususally like the taste of mayo., too! I even used fresh asparagus and fresh baby portabella mushrooms. What a waste of ingredients. It was the sauce that  made it bad. I have never given a recipe a one star review until now.

Well, this certainly took more prep work than I think a casserole should.  Ultimately, I thought it was good but VERY rich.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, couldn't say enough good things about it.  If it were strictly up to me, I would probably not make this again.

I made this recipe for an office lunch and it was a huge hit. I used long grain wild rice and 2 cans canned chicken, as well as fresh asparagus rather than frozen. It was better to be a little heavier with the chicken and asparagus than the recipe asked for. I will definately make this again.

I changed a few things, my husband doesn't like mushrooms and used cream of chicken soup, but my family loved it.  We used fresh asparagus and steamed it for 20 minutes instead of canned, but it turned out great.  It doesn't take much time, either.  I am sharing this one with friends and putting it in my "favorite dinners" book!
