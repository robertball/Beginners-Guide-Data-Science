It was really good I made one change.  I don't keep bisquick in the house and did not want to buy a huge thing for one recipe. I bought a thing of bisquick compelte in the bag.  mixed it to the intructions on the bag and baked it only additionl 11 mintues because biscuits were done.  Excellent turn out.  I used the cheddar garlic biscuits and it was great

I made this exactly by the recipe except doubled everything and added some cooked diced potatoes.  It was delicious even my pickiest kids ate it.  Great recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe.  It was EXTREMELY dry and I didn't enjoy the taste of the cheese.  The flavor of the bacon really stood out too.  It all just didn't come together well enough for me.

I really liked this. I did add some rosemary, cheddar cheese and garlic to the biscuit mix.For future reference, I would cut down the bacon a bit. I think 4-6 slices would achieve the same result as the 8 called for in the recipe, with a bit less fat. The cooking time was spot on and it was an easy recipe with things I already had around the house. Thanks!

Instead of using french-fried onions (husband doesn't like), I sauteed a finely chopped medium onion and precooked crumbled bacon in melted butter on the stove in a large sautee pan.  I then added the other ingredients and heated on the stove (this step omits the 15 min in the oven).  I then transferred the mixture to a casserole dish and followed the rest of the instructions.  My husband loved the recipe and I definately will make it again!

i can't believe i made something that wasn't yet rated but this is SO first class. when my 4 year old eats it...i KNOW it's good. i made a few changes. used fresh boneless chicken and cooked the first leg of recipe for 30 minutes. also used buttermilk instead of milk. bacon is a MUST in my opinion--the dish tastes cheesy and bacony--wonderful! the biscuits come out BETTER than homemade!

Easy and fast to put together. I used canned biscuits and frozen peas and carrots. I did season the chicken with season all and a dab of garlic when I cooked it. We didn't care for the cheese on top of the biscuits. Sorry but we voted not to have this one again although it was okay.

My family loves this recipe. The only thing I change is the biscut topping. I use bisquick, but I add shredded cheese, garlic powder and sage to the dough.

This was very easy to make.  It is simple and good. It is comfort food and tastes alot like Chicken Pot Pie.
