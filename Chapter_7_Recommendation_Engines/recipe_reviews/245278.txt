Made as written and this was pretty good. There are two things I do want to address with this recipe. First is that I feel the chicken/hominy ratio is off. I suggest adding another can of hominy. Secondly, if you are only going to use half of the salsa verde in the posole then why make double the amount needed?  The verde IS good but unless you are planning on eating it with chips or using it in another recipe I recommend halving that step. Don't forget the toppings...it all goes hand in hand. Be adventurous and throw some thinly sliced radishes on top if you dare...

I'd say next time I'd add all the salsa, half the chicken an extra can of hominy and 1 or 2 less tomatillos but other than that it was DELICIOUS..
Thanks for sharing recipe.

So very good, I needed to add more broth though.  I'm making it again this week.  The salsa is incredible also.

Flavor is yummy,!  I did modify , I used pork rather than chicken, basically doubled the recipe given the numbers to be served.  So was short on time given my crock died Mid way through the cooking process and had to punt. Used canned rinsed tomatillos, canned diced green chili’s and 1\3 can diced Jalapenos.  Blended all with the spices. Transferred the meat to a stove top pot Added all together and let it simmer. It was delicious. Thank you. I’ve been looking for a great green posole recipe!  Next time will try The chicken. Pauline 11/2019

I made this tonight and thought it was a fantastic soup full of flavor..I did not have the hominy on hand  but substituted a Birds Eye blend of corn, carrots and asparagus that I had. Did everything else per recipe and added all of salsa..Crushed tortilla chips and sliced avocado on top with a squeeze of lime..Delicious!! Will be making again!

I made this with some leftover pork carnitas from the other night. It was already seasoned, but I added the seasoning on this recipe anyway minus the salt. I was super confused by the use of half of the salsa verde, and just decided to add it all, plus double the lime juice and a little water. Good flavors though.

Really good! I did not add salt, reduced the number of sorranos to one just because I don't do well with heat and boiled the chicken instead of crockpotting it. The next time I make it....may try it with pork instead :)

I made this dish last night.  My husband goes bananas for it, and I am surprised by how good it is.  I added blue corn chips, non fat sour cream, and cubed avocados as garnish. Yum!

One of my favorite soups, I couldn't find any fresh tomatillas at the grocery store, so I substituted a jar of roasted Verde salsa, it just added more delicious flavor.
