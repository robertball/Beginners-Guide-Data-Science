I thought this was a decent meal and my husband loved it!  We used whole grain rice instead of long grain and I served it with glazed carrots.  The only concern I have is that it was a bit salty and the mushroom soup really offset any hope this dish had of tasting "Asian".

I hesitated to make this due to the bad reviews but our family gobbled it up. I doubled the sauce and rice and added a little bit more chicken (we have 3 growing boys!) and didn't fully double the honey. Threw in a package of stir fry veggies a touch more garlic. I put a chinese hot sauce on mine but we thought it was good and the easy of preparation can't be beat!

It mystifies me as to what makes this dish "ASIAN", but it is very good. Followed recipe exactly except I increased the rice and water by 1/4 c ea and used 50% more honey than called for as personal preference. Cut 3 rather large chicken breasts in 1/2 for portion control. Chicken came out so tender you could cut it with a fork and is great next couple days as leftovers. Will definately make again. ** I like adding the frozen broccoli to this very much, but cook for 60 min instead of 45 if you do!!! Otherwise the rice won't cook!**

We loved this.  I added a little more honey and some celery seed. I made the sauce & added shredded cooked chicken. I served the rice on the side. It's even better the next day.

My family loved this meal. Knowing that the chicken might be bland. I used cayenne pepper for flavor. I also used chicken broth and 1 1/3 rice to cut down on the water contend that happen. The chicken was moist. Also it took hour and half to cook. I added frozen broccoli for color. A quick and easy dish.

The dish is not excellent... It does have a strange flavour to it, not sure if I would make it again.

My husband said the chicken was very moist and, when eaten in the same bite as the rice, very flavorful. I still think it needed something, but I just can't put my finger on it.

Ugh. I didn't think much of the ingredients as they were listed and wondered how the heck they'd be Asian, and you know what they say - I should have gone with my gut, because this recipe sure didn't. Wow, I have never given a recipe one star before, but in all honesty I'd hate to mislead anyone reading my review, so here it is: One child took one bite and left the rest untouched, the other child ate hers and asked me not to make it again. I should mention I made a vegetarian version, i.e., broccoli and no chicken, and per another review had to cook it the full hour to get the soup cooked into the rice.

We didn't like this, it was just too bland.  The chicken was very moist but the taste was just blah to us.  I subbed chicken broth for the water and added some fresh grated ginger to the sauce.

I did not care for this recipe. I was in too much of a hurry to add any real Asian seasoning to it, so I should have known it would be disappointing.  This tasted nothing even related to anything Asian, and we do eat a lot of Asian-inspired meals (Chinese, Japanese, Korean & Thai).  I did follow the tip and added the broccoli florets. Very disappointed in Campbell's.
