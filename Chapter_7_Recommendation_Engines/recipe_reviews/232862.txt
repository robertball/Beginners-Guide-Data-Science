Super easy recipe I made even quicker and easier by using steam in the bag veggies.  I forgot baby corn, so we didn't have it.  This was a nice side dish for Chef John's New Orleans-Style BBQ Shrimp.  THANKS for the recipe!

Oh my goodness, it's a good thing this was healthy because I had three helpings! Made it with fresh picked sweet corn (two ears) and green beans from the garden. We skipped the mushrooms since we don't care for them - and I probably didn't use a full tablespoon of cajun seasoning, just eyeballed it. The HUSBAND (broccoli is a "vile weed") had three helpings. It's that good. Thank you!!

I used regular whole kernel corn, instead of baby corn.

I did not care much for the seasoning, but I loved the combination of vegetables.

Who'd have thought I'd wish there was nothin' on my plate but these green beans & veggies!?!  Yum!  ----   We had a load of green beans from a kind neighbor, so we used mostly green beans, and tossed in a little else that we happened to have on hand.  I'd already tossed some onions into a skillet with into some oil before we decided what all we'd do with the green beans.  Then we cooked up the other veggies combining them together with the onions..... and ...... yum!
