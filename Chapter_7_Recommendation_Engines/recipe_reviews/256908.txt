These were excellent and the sauce was amazing! There are a couple of discrepancies in the recipe which I am going to point out so that hopefully it helps anyone reading this prior to making it. Four cakes is really all you are going to get so keep that in mind. As you get to step 3 and start assembling your cake mixture it calls to add mustard, paprika, and cayenne. The mustard actually goes in the sauce and it is the Old Bay that goes in the cake mixture. The paprika and cayenne are not on the ingredient list so I winged it and used 1 teaspoon of paprika and a dash of cayenne and that was perfect. I also only ended up needing 1 cup of breadcrumbs and the y held together great. My husband and I both loved these and this is one I will make often. The remoulade is amazing!

We thought these were just ok. Hubby asked me not to make them again since there are so many other crab cake recipes that we do like. Maybe it was the fact that I used canned crab (as called for in the recipe) instead of fresh that made us not care for this recipe. I must admit that the remoulade sauce is delicious as are the Ball Park Buns.

I made only the remoulade sauce tonight because I wanted it with my salmon patties I had made. I enjoyed this sauce, although it didn't taste like what I've had at restaurants before.  Good, though, and certainly complemented the salmon.

I loved this recipe. Being from Maryland, I have a lot of access to good crab cakes, and I thought these were an excellent way to bring it home. We used two different varieties of crab meat, minced and sliced, in order to add texture to the patty. I also added coconut flour instead of bread crumbs for a gluten free alternative and to make it lighter - after all, I'm eating this on a bun! I was thrilled to find that this recipe, along with the sauce, was excellent and a perfect way to spend a summer night cooking.

I cannot give this a five star rating because I don't even know if I made the crabcakes correctly. The instructions call for ingredients which are not even listed. I was able to make 8 normal sized crab cakes and one jumbo sized crab cake. I found it easiest to dump the mixture out onto parchment paper, press it down to about 1/3" thickness and then I used a biscuit cutter to form the crab cakes. I wouldn't mind trying this recipe again if the ingredients/instructions were corrected.

I have to agree with the other reviewers, that this really only makes 4 servings (I used 4 buns, not the 8 the recipe calls for) . While the cake mixture is the perfect balance between wet-to-dry ingredients, I think these would benefit from using fresh lump crab meat as opposed to canned. Canned crab to me just doesn't have the same flavor as fresh. I really enjoyed the remoulade sauce.  NOTE: Step 3 calls for paprika & cayenne, but they are not listed in the ingredients. I used 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp cayenne, and it worked well.

OUTSTANDING recipe! We spent many years in Maryland indulging in Chesapeake Bay crab cakes, and this recipe does not disappoint. I mixed some crushed Ritz crackers into the bread crumbs, and I used panko for the bread crumbs. I added a tiny splash of Worcestershire sauce and a tiny bit of Dijon mustard as well. Loved how the panko breaded the crabcakes. Panko is made from a Japanese bread that doesn't soak up a ton of oil, so the cakes themselves were not at all oily. LOVED the remoulade as well -- we consider ourselves fairly versed in Cajun/NOLA cooking, and while this is a bit different from what you'd find there, it is truly very delicious. I added one dill pickle spear, diced. Really and truly a perfect recipe. And Ballpark buns are delicious. Thanks, Ballpark!!

My review is only for the sauce.  We liked it and used it on Zucchini Cakes.  I'm not sure what the sauce should taste like, but it was good.  Actually, the zucchini cakes would have been equally as good without the sauce.

I was looking for a recipe for a remoulade and found this recipe, so this review is only for the remoulade. I made it as is - it is excellent. The 2nd time, I made a few small changes: 1) instead of mayo and horseradish, I used the wasabi mayo from Trader Joes, quantity same, skip the horseradish. 2) I used Siracha for the hot sauce since I like mine spicy, 3) I skipped the garlic granules, used fresh minced garlic instead (1 clove). Again the remoulade came out wonderful, we all loved it. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious.  I did add celery and onion, as suggested, and skipped the hot sauce, as I cannot eat spicy food. Great dish!

I used hush puppy mix instead of the bread or crackers because that's what I had.  Also should have left the salt out because the Old Bay was enough.   I will definitely make again. Easy and good.

I think a lighter version with greek yougurt would suit us more. It was good, great flavor.. but very heavy.

I liked the flavor of these but the texture needed more variety. Next time I'll use a lump crab meat. I skipped the red onion since so little of it was called for. Who cuts up an onion just to use a couple teaspoons of it? I also left out the cayenne and hot sauce because of the rest of the family; it was good without it. I only got 4 patties instead of 8 but that was ok.

I love crab cakes, but, this is the first time I have made them.  I do prefer a crab cake with big pieces of crab, so, I used packaged crab from the meat dept. instead of canned crab from the grocery aisle.  I thought the crab cakes were good, but, had a tad too much old bay seasoning for us.  We made our crab cakes a little larger, so, we only got 4 out of the recipe instead of 8.  We loved the remoulade sauce.  It had a great combination of flavors!  Tangy & spicy from the horseradish.

This was very delicious recipe and I can't wait to make it again.  I love crab cakes and this took me back to my trip to Florida.  The recipe could be confusing saying to put all ingredients all in a bowl.  It in fact refers to the first half intended for the sauce.  Still turned out great.

Yum! I love crab cakes & I hate when they are too "bready." I also never thought I'd want to eat one on a bun! But these were extremely tasty! The cake had so much flavor (just enough bread crumbs to hold them together), the sauce was perfectly on point, and I can't get over how amazing these Ball Park Buns are! I do agree that this recipe only makes 4 bun-sized crab cakes and that I didn't need a full cup of breadcrumbs for the coating - 1/2 cup is plenty. Thanks for the great recipe! This is a keeper!

I used lumped crab and cut back a smidgeon on the seasoning because I didn't want to mask the flavor of the crab.  Also, I made them a little larger than requested.  Why not?  The  delicious remoulade sauce is the perfect accompaniment.   The buttered rolls completed this tasty and satisfying sandwich.

We really enjoyed these sandwiches and we absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the sauce, which I will be using for  a dipping sauce for a variety of seafood. Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious.. made this for my Mom for dinner one night. She agreed it was wonderful..  The recipe calls for 8 buns, and states six servings, but this really makes four burgers. I reduced the crumbs in the burger by 1/4 cup and didn't need the full extra cup to dredge
