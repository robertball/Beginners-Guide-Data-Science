I also doubled the topping. I had all the ingrediants ready and realized I did not have pie dough... What to do? I am known for "winging it" soooo... I buttered my glass pie pan real slick and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over it. I then cut the crusts off of some white bread and smooshed it into the bottom and sides of my pan. I then followed the recipe. It turned out yummy. Usually the crust does not stay intact when I try to serve it. The bread not only turned a lovely brown, and served up intact but the little cinnamon on the bottom was just right! And to top it all... It was a cinch to make!!

I can't say enough about this recipe. It was fantastic! It's like rhubarb crisp and rhubarb pie all in one but better than both. I followed the directions exactly and used the "best ever pie crust" recipe on this site for the crust. I used frozen rhubarb and drained it well after thawing so that my pie wouldn't be too wet. It was perfect.

This recipe turn my non rhubarb loving husband into a ravinous rhubarb-pie eating monster! I did use a 9 inch pie plate. Added an extra cup of rhubarb and 1/3C xtra sugar and tsp extra flour. Then for the topping I used Rice Krispies and just about doubled all toppings also. Baked it in a gas oven for additional 30 minutes, then shut off and let sit for an hour also. Nearly divine! I planted extra rhubarb this year for this pie alone!!!

Fabulous pie. I've never done rhubarb without berries before, so I was hesitant. It tasted great, and the topping is one I will use on other pies in the future. I used some extra corn flakes because I like lots of crispiness with my crumble topping.  Tasty.

Very Good!!  After reading the other reviews I also doubled the topping, but will lessen the amount of butter next time.  We found it to be a bit greasy on top, but very tasty!  Not too sweet and not too tart...Just Right!  Thanks for sharing, Pam!

This is an excellent pie in terms of flavor and ease of preparation.  I enjoyed 
it because it was not "too sweet" as some rhubarb pies can be.  I used Honey Nut
Corn Flakes and added about 1/4 cup more than recipe called for and had just
wonderful results.  And I especially appreciated that the crispiness of the topping
was maintained over until the second day of serving . . . a real plus for smaller
families who do not consume an entire pie at one meal.  I will definitely make this
one again and again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used graham wafer crust because I can't make a pastry dough to save my life, and it was just like apple crisp only with rhubarb! Yum

This pie is wonderful!! I doubled the crumb topping like others suggested, and I used a little more rhubarb, about 4 1/2 cups, and it turned out perfect. Will definately be making this again!! Thanks!

Made 2 pies with this recipe to take to work.  Rhubarb is my favorite kind of pie.  The filling was wonderful, kinda sweet and kinda tart, just like I like.  I was not, however, a fan of the cornflakes in the topping.  They gave what I thought was an odd texture, not really crispy.  Was I supposed to crush the flakes?  I'll make this again but leave out the cereal.

Fabulous!!  I made this for my Dad as a "memories of the farm" dish for Thansgiving.  He, and the non-rhubarb fans LOVED IT!  Wish I had made two pies - will next year.  Sweet and different.

I was sold when I read very few changes to the original recipe.  This was a hit at a Memorial Day picnic.  I believe it will even convert those who think they don't like rhubarb.

so i'm only giving this four stars, but it's probably me more than the recipe.  it was VERY good, but just too tart for my personal taste.  my boyfriend LOVES it though.  and yes, that cornflake topping is to die for!!!  i'll definitely be putting that on future (sweeter, lol) pies!  one note to potential bakers: i bought the frozen "Deep Dish" pie crusts (Pillsbury) and there was not enough filling to fill the crust.  so use the shallower ones!  anyway, thanks for a good recipe and a GREAT topping and i DO recommend this to people who don't mind a little tartness!!

I loved this pie! I made it in a 12" pie pan. After reading the reviews, I doubled everything. baked it for an hour then let it sit in the oven for an hour and it made a perfect 12" pie. It was a full, sweet and tangy, crispy masterpiece. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I can't wait for apple season. I want to try this crispy topping on an apple pie.

I have never made a rhubarb pie, so I had no idea if it would be any good.  Being from the midwest, I've had rhubarb pies/crisps quite a few times.  It's one of those things that is so specific, you don't know if everyone will like it.  I decided to try this recipe and it was absolutely delicious!!  And, very, very quick to prepare and easy to make.  The topping really gives you the best of both worlds - pie and crisp.  I used a premade pie crust and it worked great (put tinfoil around the sides, take off about 15 minutes or so before the pie is done).  I was worried about the rhubarb being too tart, so I added a bit of brown sugar to the white sugar/rhubarb mix.  It set up perfectly, went great with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great, simple, delicious recipe!!

great recipe. I had never made a rhubarb pie before and hadn't had good luck with crisps so I wasn't sure how I'd do. I've made 4 pies now with this recipe and every one of them have been fabulous :)

As a fan of rhubarb pie, I was excited to try this one!  I had to make one substitution-frosted flakes for corn flakes. I did double the topping as people noted and I added a bit less brown sugar since the flakes were frosted! Yummy! Tart and sweet!

I didn't have enough rhubarb so I added about a cup of strawberries to the mix. Used a pre-made crust from Trader Joe's and added extra crispy topping. MAN was this good. I'm usually not a pie lover but this was amazing. We ate almost half the pie when it came out the oven. Will make again and again. So simple and delish!

My husband (who doesn't usually care for rhubarb) thought this recipe should get a "five star" rating. The only reason I'm giving it a "four" is because it was a bit runny. Of course, with good vanilla ice cream, the extra liquid did add some more flavor!

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy.  I had about 3 cups of rhubarb so I added a layer of fresh sliced strawberries.  I also doubled the topping.  My family finished it before it was cool.

This is a great recipe!! We really loved the crunch in the topping with the corn flakes.  Really nice combination. Second time I made it I just increased the rhubarb a bit and also the sugar and flour.  Doubled the topping.  YUmmy. Thanks for sharing.

OMG! So easy and simple and soooooo good. My husband was really reluctant to try this (his mom used to make an awful rhubarb pie), but he loved it too. I'm going to use the crust on other pies. Also, I only had 2+ cups of diced rhubarb. I used the same amount of everything else and it turned out fabulous still.

All my guests went on and on about how great this pie was.  My husband's favorite recipe used to be the Strawberry Rhubarb, but not any longer.  He said he wants me to replace it with the Crispy Rhubarb Pie.

I have never cooked with rhubarb before.  This pie was both easy and quick to prepare.  I used a pre-made deep dish pie crust.  Changed rhubarb to 4 cups and added a little extra sugar and flour to compensate for the additional rhubarb.  Made 1 1/2 times the amount of topping and it was perfect.  My husband raved over the pie.  I didn't have plain corn flakes so I used frosted flakes.  It was good.  Next time I might substitute oatmeal for the corn flakes to see how that works.  Corn flakes are slightly chewy after baking.

Delicious......I made it in a graham cracker crust.  It came out more like a rhubarb crisp than a pie, but it was excellent.  May even try it with other fruits (blueberries, perhaps)  I did not double the topping as some other reviewers have.  I think it would have been too sweet.  The topping was perfect for the 9" pie.

This recipe was pretty good...although I only gave it 3 stars.  I doubled the crumb topping for this pie.  However, the topping got a little too crispy.  It was almost borderline "hard".  Perhaps I will try it again and see if I recieve the same results...maybe I pressed it down a little too firmly?  But the pie itself tasted great...I even added some strawberries like other reviews had suggested.  That was a nice summer addition!

Although my husband liked this pie the rest of us didn't really care for it. We felt it had much to much sugar and the corn flakes didn't really go with the "crust."  It was fairly easy to make but not one that I will make again.

Awesome! 2 things: definitely double the topping per other reviewers and if you are using a deep pie dish like I did, you can increase your filling as well by at least a cup of rhubarb (don't forget to add an extra dash of sugar and flour to the mix as well). Delish!

Great pie. I've never made one with just rhubarb and no other fruit and was pleasantly surprised. I did add a dash of nutmeg to the filling and a dash of cinnamon to the topping.  It was SO easy and not overly sweet.

Last night I made it for the second time (added a heart-cut strawberry on top of the crust for Valentines).  This time I used bran flakes because that's what I had in the house.  It was still very good (more like a crisp though), but having tried the cornflakes the first time, I know that the cornflakes are MUCH better!

I really liked this recipe and it was very straightforward. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because my dad, who is a rhubarb fanatic, thought the topping was too much. I, on the other hand, was left wondering why I have poured milk on cornflakes all these years when brown sugar and melted butter is so much more delicious! :+)

This is a very good pie - a little bit on the tart side but very good. I adjusted the topping like a lot of other reviewers did. First I used rice krispies since I don't have corn flakes.  I doubled the amount of krispies but did not double the other ingredients plus I added a few crushed walnuts.  The topping was perfect!

I used a little less sugar, around 1/3 cup in each part, and it was sweet enough for our taste. We liked it warm, but also cold the next day. The crunchy topping stayed crunchy. I also used a bIt more corn flakes in the topping, around 3/4 cup.

Mmmmm, yummy! I'm not quite sold on the cornflakes topping though, didn't think the cornflake taste quite meshed, next time I'll try chopped walnuts or pecans instead. Other than that it was all delicious awesomeness!

The pie, overall, was okay but I didn't enjoy the topping, though my husband did.  I found the topping way too greasy.  If I were to make it again, rather than lessen the quantity of butter, I'd use more of the other ingredients because I would have preferred more topping.  Also,if there is a next time, I'd add cinnamon to the rhubarb mixture as well as the topping.  Rhubarb and cinnamon - just made to go together!

Nice when you can't decide between a crisp and a pie. I went with the walnut pieces instead of crushed cereal. Less carbs and more Omega 3 healthy fat!

I LOVE rhubarb pie, and when I made this one I had to substitute Special K w/red berries since I had no cornflakes on hand. It was GREAT. However, there was too much of the crumbly topping. I used about half of the crumble topping mixture. Made that way, the pie was perfect and the whole pie eaten in mere hours. If it weren't for the excessive topping, this would be a 5 STAR Recipe, for sure!  Loved it, though and will definitely make it again!

Wow...can you say easy?  I have never been a good baker but am trying new things and this turned out great!  I added a little bit more sugar and used honey bunches of oats because it was the only cereal we had.  Yum!

I used a bag of frozen rhubarb which was 4 cups.  I adjusted everything and added a little extra topping as suggested by someone.  I used a frozen pie shell (defrosted).  For some reason the pie was really wet and the pie shell was kind of mushy.  Still had a good taste.  Due to it being wet I gave it 4 stars and will probably try something else next time.

At the last minute, I realized that I didn't have corn flakes so I used rice krispies instead.  I was surprised on how well it turned out.  Delicious!!  Thanks

I am not a big rhubarb fan but my husband is.  this is a delicious and easy recipe.  THe topping really adds extra sweetness that rhubarb often needs.  I doubled the topping just to be sure.  I would definitely keep this recipe

I fell in love with the corn flake topping on this pie and have since used it with other fruit pies--blueberry is my favorite, but hubby maintains the original rhubarb is the best.

I would personally throw in another half cup or so of the rhubarb.. my pie seemed a little empty.  Tasty though, especially with some strawberry and vanilla ice cream on top.

This is a very tastey pie.  The topping is different but has a great flavour.  I will make this one again.  I used a quiche pan and added about another cup and a half of rhubarb.

This was a great recipe.  I had never made a pie before, and this was a wonderful recipe.  Thanks.
