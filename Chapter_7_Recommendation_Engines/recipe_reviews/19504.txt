Use Salt Pork - these days "Bacon" comes with flavors (maple!!) that don't blend well with clams.
BUTTER (!), Thyme (CAREFUL! Go Slow.  It can quickly overpower the chowder!) & White Pepper.
Best made the "Day Before".  Like many soups, stews and chowders . . . time adds to the fullness of the flavor.

I "doctored" and "cheated" a bit as every cook does: used 3 cans diced potatoes, 2 cans sliced carrots, sauteed the chopped onions and celery with a heaping tablespoon minced garlic in the bacon fat, and used a combination of half and half and heavy cream.  Didn't have any clam juice but used 4 cans chopped clams, juice and all.  Added a good bit of black pepper to stand up to the cream base and a touch more garlic salt for proper seasoning.  Threw it all in the crockpot 8 hours on low...PERFECT-O. Before serving, I dissolved about 5 tablespoons cornstarch in cold water and mixed in to thicken it up to an appropriate "chowder" consistency.  So delicious!!!  A winter-time favorite!

This recipe was good after I made some changes to suit my taste. I used a 28oz. can of whole baby clams, 4 potatoes, a 14 1/2 oz. can of evaporated milk, 1 cup of water, and I thickened it with a little flour. I used turkey bacon, but the bacon flavor was strong, so I will cut down on it and use just 9 slices instead of 12 next time.  I felt the recipe could use more seasoning, so I added garlic, parsley, thyme, and chicken bouillon. I served it with hot dinner rolls and the family enjoyed it. Will make it again.

A true New England chowder.  No need to add any thickening agents...the potatoes and cream do that perfectly!  I chop a handful of celery leaves and add a bit of dry marjoram to the potato, celery and clam broth while they simmer together. I too prefer salt pork to bacon.  I often make a "base" with this to freeze for later, especially when clams are plentiful in the warm months.  I make it up to the point where I would add the cream and freeze in quart sized containers. When I'm ready to use it, I thaw the base in the refrigerator and heat slowly with the cream.  I also prefer adding cracked black pepper to taste individually.

I added garlic, salt, and cracked pepper. I used 3 cans of chopped clams in place of what was called for in the recipe because I did not have access to shucked clams.  My family loved this recipe.  It was a little "ligher" than a traditional clam chowder and we liked that.  We will make this again.

Just about as perfect as it gets.  Good sourdough bread and some citrus salad or Waldorf salad and you have a real Saturday night meal.

This was an easy recipe and the only changes I made were to add a bit more seasonings, clams, and potatoes to suit my taste.  Very yummy!

I didn't like the part about not draining off the bacon fat after frying.  It made the whole chowder too fatty and greasy.  In fact, my stomach hurt after eating this chowder.  My husband (a New Englander, himself) said it tasted like bacon chowder, not clam chowder.

I cook the chop and cook the  bacon, add the chopped onion, celery and cook until translucent then set aside. I use the same pot to cook the cubed potatoes; I use 3 or 4 cans of  chopped clams, I poor the juice off the clams over the potatoes and cook until starting to soften. You can add a little water if need be to just submerge the potatoes in liquid. I also use 2% milk instead of half and half to keep the fat down. You can thicken with cornstarch and water if need be.

I wanted to make Maine clam chowder after visiting Maine this last summer.  This was a very easy receip.  It was more thin and brothy than I thought it would be, but looked similar to the recipe in my Maine cookbook (which I lost, hence turning to this recipe).  The cookbook recipe did not call for bacon, so I didn't have any on hand.  Instead I added some real bacon bits as this was simmering.  So I just cooked the onions in some butter.  I also didn't have that many clams on hand, so I made do with two cans.

Good chowder but somewhat bland. I would probably add some additional seasonings next time - maybe thyme or rosemary. Mine turned out to be very hearty and I didn't think I had enough liquid, so you may want to add more clam juice or half and half. For a thicker chowder, you may want to thicken with flour.

I don't like when people rate recipes without following the recipe exactly, but here I go, too.  I didn't TRY to alter it, but it happened because I realized I didn't have the exact amount of the ingredients. But I'm still rating this a 5, because I make soup a lot, and I didn't think clam chowder would be this easy (and it's usually really expensive to make). But since I fudged on the recipe, I thought I'd give this a 5 star rating, not only because it's simple to make, but because it's so flexible!  So here's what I did. I only had 3 8 oz. jars of clam juice and one can of whole clams in juice. I cooked the potatoes in the clam juice, sautéed the bacon, celery, onion together as directed and then added 4 T. of cornstarch. I didn't have any half and half so I used a can of evaporated milk and a little 2% milk. Added a touch of salt and pepper and it was great!
