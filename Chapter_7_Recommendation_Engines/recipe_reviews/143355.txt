This was a refreshing summer meal! I would suggest though that if you're going to keep some for leftovers, to not use nectarines that are too ripe.

Wow!  The nectarine salsa is delicious - wouldn't change a thing!  I used half the amount of pork and cut into cubes to make kabobs.  I added some paprika to the rub and let it marinate about 6 hours.  Great meal!

This was a great and easy way to use pork.  I replaced the tomato with an equal amount of canned pineapple tidbits and probably doubled up on the pork rub, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as stated.

This is a great recipe - the salsa has an awesome flavour, and I wouldn't change a thing. I think the recipe does need the fresh cilantro to ensure it has the complex flavour of fruit salsas.  I can't wait to try the leftovers on grilled chicken. YUM!

Very good recipe.  I used peaches instead of nectarines and it still was good.  I added a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of the lime juice.

YUMMY!!! My husband and I loved these! Don't leave any ingredients out, it is perfect! I am not an onion fan but I think if I hadn't used it it wouldn't have been near as good. I love the cilantro, it gives it a fresh taste! I would recommend this to everyone! It is pretty easy and delicious!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  Nice and refreshing for a summer night.  I would use nectarines and tomatoes that were a bit more ripe next time for added sweetness.

I let the rub soak into the chops (and used bone-in) for a couple of hours, otherwise I followed the recipe...it was very tasty, really liked the salsa. Would have given 4 1/2 stars if it was possible, not quite sublime enough for 5 but quick and will do again, maybe with more spice next time...?

Great.  We marinated the pork in the oil/cumin mixture for a few hours.  Fresh, tangy and light.

This salsa is delicious! I used pork terderloins which we like to grill with montreal steak seasoning.  So instead of putting the rub on the pork I added about 1/2 teaspon of cumin right to the salsa.  Sooo good!

Yummmmmm! Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again. I wasn't able to grill, so I broiled the chops. I should have done just 3 mins on each side, but I started with 4 mins for the first side and then did 3 mins after turning over. They were just slightly overcooked, but still moist and tender. The salsa is wonderful. I recommend serving with the black beans and rice recipe by Robyn Webb on this site.

OOOOHHHH...MAMA! Thanks to AR I'm now pretty good at scanning recipes to predict a yummy outcome.  After the first bite of this we just sat there and stared at each other. I don't think I have ever eaten more than one pork chop at a meal but I sure kept my eye on the extra one. About 3 hours went by and I couldn't stand it any more. So much for not eating past 7:00PM. I'm one who enjoys a varied menu. My mother served the same thing every week. Ditto Ditto-Saturday-hot dogs, Sunday-roast beef, Tuesday-spaghetti. I swore I wasn't going to do that. Too predictable and monotonous. This meal, I could easily eat once a week. Peaches are glorious this time of year and I always look forward to buying a basketful. If peaches are all you have, they work wonderfully as a sub for the nectarines.  I made a silly mistake by adding the cumin, chili and pepper to the salsa. I made a little more to rub on the meat. The ingredients sing in this recipe. Thank you MICHELLE

I made this tonight and everyone loved it! I shopped for really fresh ripe fruit and tomatoes from the farmers market and used a little more lime juice than the recipe called for. I also just cooked my meat inside on a cast iron grill and it stayed very moist. Will make this again!

We love this! The spice on the chops and the sweetness of the necterine are a good combo! Plus it is fast and easy.

I substituted peaches, but everything else was the same. It went over extremely well--very nice balance of flavors in the salsa, the chops were flavorful but not spicy...if you're nervous about trying it on your kids, go for it!

Very tasty and refreshing. I followed the receipe as is. My pork chops may have been a little tough but I think that was my fault perhaps I overcooked them.

Very good. Quick and easy, just the way I like it. I substituted nectarines with apples because as everyone knows apples goes great with pork chops.

Adobo seasoning will work better for the chops.  The nectarine salsa sounds better that what it turns out to be.

Flavorful and delicious! Best fruit salsa I have ever had! Probably a bit too spicy for the kids...but looking forward to adding this to our dinner rotation (and just modifying the spices on the kids pieces)!

This was a real treat!  We mixed the spices right into the olive il and brushed on while cooking.    My husband and I both commented on how nicely the flavours in the rub mixed with the salsa.  We are going to try it again tomorrow but with chicken!

great recipe. I altered it somewhat & made a Jamaican jerk marinate for the chops in lieu of the cumin & chili powder. It was fabulous with the nectarine salsa.

Fantastic meal! I don't eat cilantro so I typically substitute fresh mint and/or basil in salsa. It worked well for this salsa too.

This was a hit it my house!  Husband said it was "worthy of company." Pork chops were actually moist for a change! One suggestion, leave the salsa at room temperature for about an hour rather than refrigerate it.  The flavors blend much more fully at room temperature.  I'm not a fan of pork chops, and even though this was really good,may try this next time with chicken breasts.  Give this recipe a try..it's easy, fool proof, and very good!

LOVE  LOVE  LOVE this.  Have made it several times to take to homebound friends - all with great reviews.  Finally made it for the family - oh my.  Only added a bit cayanne pepper to the salsa, other than that it's great!  Definately a keeper

Let me tell you this is a refreshing salsa recipe,and the combination of cumin and chili powder is awesome with only a little heat. My husband and I both liked this. I will be making this again maybe next I will use peaches just to please my husbands tastebuds.

oh. my. gosh. this was the best new dinner recipe i've tried ever. it is a new favorite in my house. we doubled up on the rub that goes on the chops which was delicious and gave them tons of flavor. and i added green onions and garlic to the salsa because i add green onions and garlic to everything i can. this was soo good!

4 1/2 stars, hubby agrees!  I used peaches instead of nectarines (all I had on hand) and doubled the amount of oil, cumin and chili powder, stirred that all together and marinated the chops for about 4 hours in it.  Quite tasty and different!  Hubby is not crazy over peaches OR pork chops but admitted he liked both fixed this way!

This was very good.  The salsa had a cooling effect on the spicyness of the pork chops.  These were a little too spicy for the kids though.  Next time I will substitute half of the chili powder for paprika.

Very nice~~refreshing for a hot summer night's dinner.  I had to use a pinch or two of sugar, though, as the nectarines were not as sweet as they should have been. I'll use this recipe again.

I liked this salsa, exactly as written, but only gave it 4 stars because the three others in my family did not (apparently they don't care for cilantro). But, I enjoyed it, and would make it again for a large gathering. I think you could easily substitute peaches for the nectarines, if preferred.

This was very good and straight forward to prepare.  It had an excellent taste and was fairly light.  The "hardest" part was dicing the nectarines.  My wife, who really doesn't like onions, LOVED the salsa.

FANTASTIC...! I love the salsa.. I used a peach instead of the nectarine because that's what i had in the kitchen. It is fantastic. My husband, is very picky, he loves it.  Thank you!!! As far as the spices....we love spicy.. so I added more spice but some people might want less spice... it's all up to you

This got rave reviews at my house.  The chops were moist and very flavorful.  I loved the salsa!  We don't like cilantro in my house, so I added fresh parsley instead.  This was a wonderfully easy dish to make.  I served it with steamed asparagus and rice pilaf.  It's definitely going into the rotation!

Loved the flavors of this salsa, it is so light and fresh and summery. I used a different pork rub, but kept the salsa exactly the same. Bet it tastes great on chicken too.

Couldn't find fresh cilantro so used dried. This may have contributed to a surprising overall lack of taste in the chops. Other than this, followed the recipe. The salsa was also surprisingly bland. Chops were grilled 4 min per side but were undercooked (chops=1" thick). 5 min to 5.5 min would have probably been better. Don't think I'll try this one again.

Absolutely perfect way to wrap up summer. So fresh and light and oh so absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently is I cooked my pork chops in a skillet instead of grilling them. Excellent!

I live in an apartment where grilling isn't really an option, and I'm in Korea where it's very hard to find lime juice and cilantro. (I ended up using lemon juice and parsley and pan-frying the pork chops--clearly not the same.) So, I'm not sure if that counts as making this recipe, but it was pretty good. I'm sure it would have been better if I had had all the right ingredients and could have grilled the meat outside. 

I'd suggest putting some minced garlic in with the meat and letting it sit for awhile before you cook the meat. Or failing that, adding some garlic powder to the rub.

The salsa recipe was very good! I couldn't find nectarines so I used mandarin oranges. Tasted sooo good! I think I would do this again as a dip. Guests loved it.

The chops were excellent but hot.  Not too hot but hot enough.  As another reviewer said, the nectarine salsa sounds way better than it actually turned out.  Was pretty much tasteless.  There are better salsas.  Still a good grilled pork chop recipe and one I'll use again.

All I made was the nectarine salsa. 

It was delicious.

I was a little skeptical about this one, but intrigued enough to try it anyway. Glad I did! It has a good balance between the sweet and savory, despite my overshooting on the cumin and the chili powder. The only “problem” is that this is far too much food for 2 people to put away in one go, so hopefully the salsa is stable enough to hold up for leftovers. I’ll probably cut it in half next time unless we’re cooking for more than just us.  But we will definitely keep this one in the rotation!

UPDATED: We FINALLY used up all of the salsa after about a week of finding new things to put it on. It held up well, but I will definitely cut the recipe in half next time. In case you were wondering, this also goes well on smoked pork tenderloin and grilled chicken breast using the same rub as specified for the pork chops here. But unless you’re cooking for a large group, you probably want to halve the amount you make.

Simple yet delicious! The pork  was simplistic yet extremely tasty. The salsa added a freshness which was delicious. I used a white peach instead of a nectarine because that’s what I had and it was absolutely delicious! The salsa can be made ahead of time for a quick meal.  Great summer time dish!

This recipe is very good, can use any fruit for the salsa. I would have thrown some watermelon in but didn't have any on hand. Nice, light summer meal. Will make it again!!!

This salsa is out-of-this-world good. Very bright tasting and pairs well with this pork marinade. I did leave out the tomato, but truth be told, I don't think it would add much to the mix.
