Egg Muffins' Haiku: "Four-fifty TOO high. Why put veggies in blender? Taste was just OK." Scrambley-low-carb/paleo/muffin-quiche ... these all have cute names, and they're so versatile and fun to eat. I'll make a dozen, freeze some and have ready-to-go breakfasts. I tried this particular recipe just for a change from my normal egg "guts" of sausage, bell pepper, cheddar, onions and kale and/or spinach. Didn't quite understand the step of blending the spinach/mushroom mixture, but I went ahead and did it anyways. Mine were also done in 28 min. in a 350 deg. oven, NOT the recommended 35 min. in a 450 deg. oven which I can only imagine would've obliterated the eggs into a dry, rubbery cup of yuck. These tasted pretty good, but I missed having a mushroom or veggie to bite into (I guess the chopped bacon made up for that!) I also didn't use the optional feta and instead sprinkled in Parmesan, along w/ S&P, as there were no seasoning/spices called for. Ended up adding a heavy splash of Texas Pete hot sauce. I'd make them again, but w/o the blender step, nor w/ the high temperature.

I just made this yesterday for the first time and I was feeling a little lazy so I didnt cook vegetables or anything. I also used what I had on hand. 1/2 yellow pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1 med onion, thawed spinach squeezed dry and a few sauted muchrooms that I had as left overs. I also added salad cheese (similar to feta). Salt and pepper. I didnt have bacon, but that could only make it better. I used a hand mixer to beat the eggs. The cooking time and heat was perfect for me and they looked pretty and stayed puffed. Since I didn't cook the vegatables the muffins were very moist. 

Great option for satisfying weekday breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a decent base recipe that you can easily customize to your preferences. Rather than mix all the ingredients together then trying to equally distribute I chose to place my veggies, meat, and cheese in each cup then I poured in the egg mixture....this also allowed each muffin to be customized so I made half with no meat. Add a little water to your eggs and this will fluff up nicely. Smoked Gouda was a delicious cheese to add a load of flavor!

These were good. Mine only took 15 minutes to cook through. I didn't use feta but chose grated Parmigiano Reggiano instead. I added a bit of cream to the mixture and this probably explains why mine fell once taken out of the oven. They puffed up wonderfully, then plop! But they were still nice to eat. I used 1/4 cup of "batter" for each tin and came up short so I tossed in two more eggs and that made 12 muffins exactly. Next time I will cut down on the onion, maybe a 1/4 cup is sufficient. Thank you Chris Denzer for sharing your recipe.

A wonderful high protein / low carb breakfast option that is better than another egg muffin recipe I tried from this site.  I used 3 egg whites and 3 eggs and they turned out well.  I added salt and pepper and put more spinach in mine than called for. Warning:  You MUST remove these from the muffin pan while still hot or they will stick.  I used bacon grease to grease my muffin tin the second batch and it came out better than the first batch with the oil.  I will be making these on a regular basis for sure. Thank you!

So frustrating. There was no flavor but more importantly the cooking instructions are to make charred nuggets and ruin your pans. I thought 35 minutes at 450 seemed a little long so I looked half way through to find that everything was burnt to a crisp. What little bit I could try just to see if the inside tasted decent was bland. Iâ€™ve never had worse luck with a recipe than this!

Cooking time was overstated. I only baked for 20 minutes and they were almost overdone. 
  Tasted good I will use as a great quick breakfast.

Love these!  I skipped the feta and used coconut oil since I follow the Paleo diet.  I also didn't blend up the veges, but think they turned out great.  I baked at 350 for about 20 minutes and they turned out great!

I just finished making these. I did not blend the ingredients together and I used more vegetables than was called for. Spooned a good sized soup spoon of veggies into muffin cup. I took advice from another reviewer and spoon the vegetables into the bottom of the muffin cup. I also used the bacon fat to grease the muffin pans. At 450 degrees F it only took about 13 minutes to bake these without over baking them. They are tasty out of the oven. Hope they will be just as good reheated.

Yummy. I've made it with egg whites and eggs. Both are great. I put it in the oven for 20 minutes so they don't come out so brown on top.
