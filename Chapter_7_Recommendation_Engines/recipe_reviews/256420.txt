Just wanted to say thank you for this recipe!  I wanted lemon baking chips to put in my lemon cookies but they just don't exist.  I almost gave up then found your recipe!
I used Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers and my chocolate stayed nice and smooth to pipe out the entire time.  Added the lemon extract but kept the chocolate white.  A nice addition to the lemon cookie recipe I found on this site as well.
Thank you, again!!!  Couldn't have been easier but I definitely need to get better at making my chips the same size :)

I'm the submitter of this recipe and I would like to add that if your chocolate starts to seize, add Crisco shortening.

Canâ€™t wait to try.  I have been looking for raspberry chips for years without success after Nestle discontinued them.
