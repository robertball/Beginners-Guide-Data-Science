Absolutely delicious! However, I did "tweak" this a bit because just by looking at the ingredient list I could tell there was too much liquid and it was way too much seasoning which would be overkill.  First I used a 3 pound bottom round rump roast vs. a chuck roast (personal pref) and placed it on a bed of portabella mushrooms along with the onion after seasoning it with the kosher salt and black pepper. I cut the wine back to 1 & 1/2 cups (used Cabernet Savignon), 2 cans of diced tomatoes (drained), subbed 2 cubes of beef bouillion vs. beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar.  I cut the seasoning down to 1 & 1/2 tsp. each of rosemary, oregano, and basil and cut the thyme down to 1 tsp. I also cut the kosher salt back to 1/2 tsp.  I set the slow cooker on low for 8 hours and let it go.  The smell was Heavenly and just as the submitter states, the aroma is that of a nice Italian restaurant.  Once the 8 hours were up I added a whole 6 ounce can of tomato paste to thicken it up and let it go on high for an additional hour. This was fabulous served with garlic red mashed potatoes and Italian green beans. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  
Next time I will use half the wine, half the broth, and double the onions and tomatoes.  (There was just A LOT of extra sauce at the end.)  
It would also be delicious adding some mushrooms towards the end of cooking.  This is a great recipe if you love to cook roasts but want to try it with a twist!

This was excellent – but only after fairly significant alterations, primarily in measurements. I drastically reduced the amount of herbs, even tho’ I used fresh.  Similarly, I also reduced the broth, wine and tomatoes to about one-fourth of what was called for!  To get the tomato taste I knew would really enrich this, I threw in a tablespoon of Pure Tomato Powder (this stuff is awesome good by the way – it’s from our (The) Spice House in Milwaukee and can be ordered online).  I dredged the roast in flour before browning it in pure (not extra virgin) olive oil, then laid it on a bed of baby bella mushrooms as well as the onions.  Even after reducing the amount of liquids significantly, this still was pretty juicy – darn good, but juicy.  I was tempted to put the juices on the stove and reduce them till much thicker, but ultimately decided against it, figuring that it would become too salty.  The meat, as expected, was fork tender and the juices were richly flavored, delicious spooned over the beef as well as some buttered linguine.   As for the excess of broth/tomato/wine juices, it will be excellent used in  the soup I plan to make tomorrow! Four stars rather than five, only because of the overload of liquids called for.

Fabulous recipe!! The only modifications I made were: (1) seared the roast on all sides, using a small amount of olive oil in a cast iron skillet, before placing in crockpot; (2) used only 1 can of diced tomatoes; and (3) added sliced mushrooms during the last 30 minutes or so. The aroma was absolutely mouth-watering!

It's nearly 100 degrees today here in Northern CA and I made this dish which is definitely more fall/winter fare but we had the hankering for beef roast.  I thought the recipe was good although there are a few things to note.  I seared the roast in olive oil before adding to the crock pot.  There is WAY too much liquid called for here.  I scaled the ingredients in half and had plenty of liquid for the roast to cook in.  After the roast cooked for 8 hours on low, I chose to strain the cooking liquid into a pan on the stove before adding the tomato paste.  It will not thicken as stated in the recipe unless you add a thickener.   I mixed up about 1-2 Tbsp. of cornstarch with a little water and mixed it in to get the desired consistency.  It made a wonderful gravy for the very tender, delicious roast.

I had a 2-pound chuck roast, so I basically halved the recipe.  I did take into consideration all the reviewers that mentioned that this had way too much liquid.  So, I used 1/2 cup red wine and 1/4 cup beef broth, and one can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  I still ended up with a lot of liquid after the roast cooked down.  I used fresh herbs, which means I should have used three times as much to replace the dry.  Well, that seemed excessive, so I used 2 t. each of fresh rosemary, oregano, basil and thyme.   I turned the slow cooker on low at 11 pm and went to bed.  I was up in time to check it after 8 hours and it was perfectly cooked.  I did drain some of the liquid off and thickened the rest with some cornstarch mixed with water.  I skipped the tomato paste.  Reheated just before serving.  Well, this turned out to be a wonderfully seasoned, fork tender and delicious pot roast!!  Having the leftovers tonight on French rolls and adding provolone.  Can’t wait!

This recipe turned out great! I'd have to agree with most reviewers here that it makes a lot of liquid! But, I took the extra liquid and tossed in the freezer. It tastes like an amazing tomato soup. I thought I'd thaw one day and pair with it with a grilled cheese sandwich.

First, let me say this was one of the best slowcooker pot roast dishes I've ever had... but I did head the advice of others and altered the liquid and spices, as written would have been too much. I used just one cup wine and 2 bouillon cubes (skipped extra salt) instead of 2 plus 1/4 cup stock. I added just 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning instead of all the others (it contains all of the herbs called for +). Those changes by themselves would have been wonderful, however because there was still a good bit of liquid, I decided to add 2 cups baby carrots and 2 Baker's cubed, 2 hours before finishing. I put the meat and vegetables in a Corning dish to serve, covered and kept warm. I put the juices in a sauce pan and added a cornstarch slury to thicken. I loved the tomato/potato/carrot mixture with a wonderful gravy. Thank you!

Sorry, didn't care for this.  Two adults rated it 3 stars and one adult a 2 star.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The roast lost it's meat flavor and all we could taste was spices.

I didn't try this yet but sounds good. I just wonder why people change the recipe and proceed to rate it by giving fair to poor ratings based on their changes. If you changed the recipe do not rate it. It is not fair to the original recipe.

This was outstanding.  Here are my minor modifications:
Seared the roast on both sides in a bit of bacon grease before putting in the crock pot.
Omitted the tomato paste.
Use a full can of beef broth.
Added a few potatoes and carrots, sliced celery and fresh mushrooms.
Definitely a keeper recipe.

The combinations of the spices with onions, garlic and tomatoes was wonderful. The red wine made a really great gravy.  I cooked my roast in the oven until it reached the rare stage. I will definitely do this over!

Tons of flavor! I used 1 clove garlic, no red wine, but used a couple gluks of balsamic vinegar. I also used tamari instead of worcestershire, fresh basil and thyme (about 2 tsp. each) and Italian seasoning (about 1 1/2 tsp.), cut the black pepper to about a 1/2 tsp. I also used about 6-7 fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded and crushed instead of the canned. Instead of the tomato paste, I thickened with arrowroot powder although the tomato paste sounded good, because I served it with brown rice and wanted more of a gravy type sauce.

I did have less beef, so I added carrot and potatoes with it instead, which was good. BUT like other reviewers (which I read too late) the amount of spice was overkill. I also didn't even add the beef broth and still ended up with a very soupy result. I thickened it with cornstarch and it was still quite thin. With changes as other reviewers noted, it would be good though.

The usual crock pot mush meat, definitely not my favorite. As per other reviews I reduced all liquids and spices by 25%. That was fine, the cooking liquid was monstrously bright, the wine ( I used a shiraz) was a little overwhleming but I thickened it with a flour slurry and it actually worked really well over the meat and potatoes ( Oven roasted spuds and carrots). The cooking vegetables, I added some sliced mushrooms, are sacrificial, not fit for consumption. If I ever made this again, I'd add a lot more vegetables to the crock pot AND I'd reverse the wine and broth ratio, twice as much broth, half the wine. However, that mush meat thing...yuck but that's just me. Wife and kid liked it fine, you might too.

I've made it several times and it has been fantastic each time.  I add large chunks of potatoes and carrots to take advantage of  the extra juice and save time and it works out great.

Yes, I made some changes based on previous reviews.  I used only half the liquid of all the liquid ingredients and still ended up with a lot of juice so I thickened it with 3 tbsp corn starch and 1/2 cup of the juice.  It was delicious served over mashed potatoes along with a veggie.  Still had left over juice which I made into a soup with a couple of mild Italian sausage, additional onion, sliced, and about a cup of chopped celery, carrots cooked in veggie broth, and some potatoes (not mashed) from the previous dinner.  Had to add about a cup more vegetable broth and voila, a delicious soup!  Served with crusty Italian bread.  All said it was yummy.  And yes, I will make it again.

Not one of my favorite roast recipes.  Boyfriend and guest liked it more than I.  All I could taste was wine and wish I could have tasted some other spices as well.

I made this last night. I floured & seared the meat. I used Italian seasoning instead of all the other spices. One can decided tomatoes & one cup beef broth & red wine. After 9 hours, I took some of the sauce out of the crockpot and added flour to thicken. When done, I poured it back into the crockpot to cook for another 45 mins. It was delicious over egg noodles. My husband loved! I will make it again soon. Thank you for sharing. Linda

This is an old favorite, to which I'd lost the recipe, though mostly knew it by heart. We used to serve it on a bed of noodles to really make a meal out of it. Have made it many times for those late night relaxing dinners.

This roast is extremely easy to make. The only real preparation is the slicing of the onions and garlic. I made it exactly as described and it was an immediate hit with the family.

Instead of a dry red, I used a sangria. Worked well.

There is a lot of liquid in this. If I ever make it again, which I doubt, I would cut down to one can of tomatoes, one cup of wine and back off on the thyme and basil. I didn't put oregano in and it was still too much. I do like spicy but this was not very good. Rather than eat the sauce it cooked in, I shredded the beef and made beef barbecue.

This was OK. I agree with others that felt  that the flavors were off, and it was basically soupy.  I used a nice red wine, and added a few more veggies like celery, carrots and mushrooms. I served it over Parmesan Polenta with roasted veggies. I had quite a lot left over, so I froze it. Not sure what I am going to do with the leftovers, and I am wondering if the flavors will improve in the freezer. I'll Update the review if they do. As is, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to make this again.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I had to tweak it a little bit, with homemade basic marinara sauce and  canned diced tomatoes with green chilies (added a nice little kick!), then used 21 Seasoning Salute from Trader Joe's in place of the seasonings called for. I also added a bay leaf. It turned out perfectly!

This was a home run on the first attempt.  The cut of meat was the only flaw, but that's what happens with a "Meat Bundle" from the butcher.

The cross rib roast was good none the less.

Stellar reviews from the fam.

Thanks for the effort in making the recipe.

The roast turned out wonderful. But to the liquids left I added a whole can of tomato paste but it didn't thicken the liquids much. So I melted 4T of butter and the added 4T of flour to make a roux which I blended into the liquid to make more of a "gravy" to pour over the roast as well as the mashed potatoes I made.

I had to omit the garlic due to an allergy and I cut the amount of thyme in half because I'm not a real fan.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions.  This was good.  There was a lot of sauce, as promised by other reviewers.  I poured off about 1/4 of the sauce, added half a can of tomato paste, shredded the beef, stirred it in, and served it with tortellini.  It was good.  I stuck the other 3/4 of the sauce in the fridge to make a tomato soup later.

I've made it several times at this point and it is definitely a hit.  The final taste depends on the wine used. Cheap bulk wine is a mistake, Zinfandel was too spicy but the blended red, a Berringer from Costco was just right. My family likes it with more veggies, but I actually prefer the original recipe.

This was a very tender, flavorful beef roast. There are so many seasonings that add to the dish. The only thing I added , in addition to the fresh garlic was garlic powder. I have picky grandkids and they gobbled it up.

I also changed It up a bit. I used a can of Campbell Golden Mushroom soup a can of French Onion soup cut back on the seasonings. Used 8oz red wine. Slow cooked it for 6 hours and it was to die for. Gravy and meat all in one.

Made exactly as instructed. Couldn’t have been better, everybody raved about it. Already requested to make this again soon. My fiancté said she could eat it everyday, so considering she’s a much better cook than I am, I thought that was great.

I made this just as the recipe is written, absolutely no changes.
It was very tender and tasted great!  It had just the right amount of spices and also just the right amount of juice. I may try the paste thickening the next time but the juices were very good sopped up with fresh bread!

I  made a few changes. I cooked the roast according to directions and cut it into small pieces. I’ve been cooked small plate size pieces of beets and carrots and celery and added that to the beef and I topped it with mashed potatoes and sharp white cheddar cheese.

This is the perfect recipe for a Sunday when I have to work. Everything goes in the slow cooker set the timer and come  home to the best smell ever and a great roast beef dinner.

Worse recipe I’ve tried in a long time. I cut the wine, herbs and tomatoes in half as suggested by other reviewers. My crock pot was full with a 3 pound rump roast. After nine hours I could tell I was going to end up with a tough unflavored mess. I got out my pressure cooker, doctored the gravy and cooked it another 45 minutes. What a total waste of time and dirty pots and pans.’

This was tasty...but I'm still not a fan of this cut of meat. I will likely use it only in soups. As for this dish, I added some  veggies and it came out a little too sweet for my tastes (carrots, parsnips and peas). Nevertheless, it worked out as a good hot dinner.

Don't have a slow cooker so I made this as an oven roast. Used diced frozen tomatoes instead of canned. Used freshly picked herbs from my garden. Skipped the beef broth, used beef granules instead to reduce liquid and reduced the salt. Poured the tomato mix over the meat, then added the remaining sliced onion and garlic. Did a 1/2 recipe using brisket. Started oven at 375 F for an hour, then reduced to 325 F for another 2 to 3 hours. Fabulous, a real keeper.

The roast turned out tender but the sauce flavor was completely lacking.  We pretty much just tasted watered down red wine.  I’d have thought with all of the seasonings it wouldn’t be so bland.  I will pass on this recipe in the future.

Too much wine and spices.  Throughout a beautiful piece of venison on this.  Yes, I know the recipe calls for beef, not venison.

In looking at reviews, I adjusted the recipe using 1.5 C of wine (Burgundy), and 1 C beef soup base instead o broth.  since my husband prefers less salt, I reduced it and added it to my portion on the table.

This was a trial run for company in a few weeks.  It will be perfect.

First time ever I've had a problem with your recipes..   I followed directions perfectly;  sauce tasted like wine. (Used Zinfandel, maybe that was the problem.)  I had to look up what to do if your sauce tasted like wine.  I did add the tomato paste and poured off 2 cups of the sauce and added plain unsalted beef broth to counteract all the wine and spice.  Result was good, but I would not recommend making this recipe as is.

Halved the spices like many recommended and also cut down on the fluid.  Overall, it was ok.  I'd be more inclined to use this recipe with some green pepper to make chicken cacciatore than a beef roast.  One of the rare recipes from allrecipes that I won't be saving to my recipe box.  Next time, I'll cube the beef and make the Savory Vegetable Beef Stew from this site if I want something similar.

This had a rich flavor we all thought was absolutely delicious! I only used one cup of wine;  I didn't slice onions and garlic thinly (didn't see the point); I browned the roast in olive oil (covered in salt, pepper, and flour); and I added a whole can of paste at the end. I love cooking with lots of spices and didn't think this was too much. Excellent recipe and I will make it again soon.

This was okay. What I liked most was the gravy but it was a lot of fussing around- I used a chuck roast and so had a lot of rendered fat. I removed the meat, poured the gravy into a stainless steel bowl and set it in ice water- once it was cooled enough I stuck the bowl in the freezer for an hour. I was then able to remove the hardened fat and thicken the gravy with tomato paste. That part was really good. The meat, not so much; we just don't care for boiled meat- I had hoped that the seasoning would be enough to cover that boiled beef taste/ texture. I most likely won't make it again

I used half of all spices and in stead of garlic cloves I used 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. Half of all liquid. 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes; drained. 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon dried thyme. Season meat on both sides salt & pepper put in crockpot on low for 8-10hrs.

This was delicious and easy! I did follow another reviewer's suggestion on using boullion cubes instead of broth, and adding a can of tomato paste for the last hour of cooking. 
A good, comfort food recipe!

This is my new go-to recipe for beef roast.  Like several others, I cut back on the liquid, but otherwise, my family loved the flavor.  Will definitely use for a quick and easy family dinner or for guests. Impressive but simple.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious.  It will definitely be a repeat menu item at our house.  The "gravy" was plentiful and  I believe with a couple of minor vegetable additions like zucchini and/or potatoes it will make a delicious tomato based vegetable soup.

It was good.  Had to leave it in the full time to get the fall apart effect I was going for.  One thing you can do is add your favorite spices - something for a little heat, something for more Italian.  Was a great option for just loading the slow cooker and getting a great meat.  For added ease, add potatoes and veggies half way through.

Great recipe. The meat was a little overdone, but that may be because I didn't have enough time to cook it entirely on Low. I cooked the recipe on Low for 5 hours and then 1.5 hours on High to make up the difference. I didn't have kosher salt, so I substituted regular salt. It will be interesting to see what the difference is with the kosher salt. I can also say that the meat makes a very tasty sandwich the next day!

Tasty recipe but way too much liquid even after compensating for that based on other reviews.  I eliminated the broth by mixing a bullion cube into the juice.  I also added a full can (small) of tomatoe paste, and later added small red potatoes to help thicken the juice.   I will make it again.

I followed the recipe to a 't', turned out wonderful! There is a lot of liquid but no concerned with it. The flavor and tenderness was perfect. As someone stated they cut back on the broth, tomatoes and wine, which I'm guessing did not hurt the flavor. Very worth taking the time to put it all together. This was for 5 adults, who all  loved it.

I followed the recipe, but reduced the spices to a more workable amount and as other reviewers advised, cut back on the liquid. Not a fan of dry red wine, so I used a Mogen David Blackberry wine, which I like cooking with.
