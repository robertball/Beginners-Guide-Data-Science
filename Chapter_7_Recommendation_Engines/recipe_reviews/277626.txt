These mashed potatoes taste just like a loaded baked potato. My potatoes were very thick and cheesy so I chose not to top the potatoes with the remaining cheese but topped them with crisp bacon bits. I had to add more milk to thin them down and I also seasoned them with salt and pepper. Thanks for sharing.
