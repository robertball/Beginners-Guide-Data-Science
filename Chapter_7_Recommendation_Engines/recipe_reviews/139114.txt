I made half of this recipe and it will fill a 7 ounce jar when done.  This is wonderful on toasted baguette bread, or crackers.  I am going to try it on a wrap or sandwich also.  After setting overnight you can taste the flavors in this spread.  I made in my blender and did not take much time at all.  Thanks!

First try.. it was wonderful!  We loved the nice blend of flavors.  I find that this recipe is very flexible to add and change ingrediants.  But her original formula is absolutely delishious!  Thanks Pam.. this was such a nice addition to our last few parties.  Makes and amazing hostess gift too!

I made this for Easter and it was GONE! Compliments from even my brother in law who never says a thing! Left out the banana peppers cuz I wasn't sure what they were. Trying it with them today(I think) for Greek Easter-are they chile peppers or sweet yellow, fresh or jarred? Great either way I am sure. Thanks so much!!!
