Other than using lemon rather than lime, this is a combination of ingredients and flavors I grew up with as a standard with many fresh vegetables. It was the pan sauteeing, however, that made me want to try this and I was very pleased. I've steamed asparagus, roasted it in the oven, and even nuked it...all good, but doing it this way just made it different -- similar to roasting, rich in color, flavor, and almost caramelized. Definitely more depth of flavor than just steaming. This method will be a repeat.

Just like the pan-fried asparagus recipe on this site except for the addition of lime juice.  I didn't have shallots, so I used chopped onion.  The asparagus was still quite crunchy after 5 minutes of cooking time, so I recommend cooking it a little longer.

absolutely delicious! I'm watching my weight, so I only used 1/2tbs butter plus 1 and1/2tsp olive oil(not canola)and didn't have lime so used lemon juice. I shall use a large skillet like recommended, as the med. one I used was not large enough for the asparagus spears to touch the bottom of pan and thus my garlic and shallots burned a bit. I ended up cutting the spears in half while still cooking in pan, but the onion/shallots had already burned! nonetheless, it was still a tasty side! loved it and will cook it many times in the future.Oh, I love garlic so I added a couple more cloves!

This was a nice new way to prepare asparagus.  It's the perfect time of year and we picked up the most wonderful thin baby stalks that cooked quite nicely.  If they were thicker I would have steamed them briefly in the microwave to get the cooking started, but it wasn't necessary the night I prepared them.  They were the perfect accompaniament to thinly sliced flank steak with a rub made from chili/lime/brown sugar and paprika and the orange romaine salad from this site.  A perfect spring meal!

Another quick and easy way to prepare asparagus. I used fresh minced garlic and cut the asparagus into 2" pieces. Cooked for 8 minutes but that might have been a little too long.

Asparagus is not my favorite; however, this recipe is delicious!  I have tried many similiar recipies, but the flavors and method of this recipe is simply delicious!  The only changes I made were to use a little less butter & olive oil and lemon instead of lime.  A keeper!!!

Made this recipe last night ... delicious!  Did not add shallot and I used Lemon juice as I had no lime.  The asparagus was still a little crunchy (perfect) and the taste was very pleasant and refreshing.  I'll be doing it this way much more .. thanx Crystian ...

quick and oh so simple. With good ingredients you get good food. Butter, shallots and garlic good on all greens,what really scores is the freshed queezed lime at the end.

This was delicious!  Served with my shrimp scampi tonight; I forgot the shallot at the store so I skipped it.  My only suggestion is to cook the asaragus and garlic on lower heat for 10 minutes so you don't get burnt garlic which is bitter.

Love this recipe. I had never prepared asparagus before and my family loved it. However, when I made it a 2nd & 3rd time it didn't turn out very good. Maybe I didn't pick out good asparagus. Not sure what I did wrong, but the first time around was perfect!

My kind of recipe:  Tasty and Easy!  This is now my favorite way of fixing asparagus.  I also use these same ingredients and method only roasting them in the oven and it turns out just as great.  Thanks, Karriparker, for a recipe that I use often!

Delicious flavors!  I roasted the asparagus with minced garlic and shallots tossed in olive oil cooking spray for about 20 minutes @ 400.  When finished cooking I squirted the lime juice all over and tossed again.  My husband & I loved the taste!

Pretty good. I didn't have shallot or onion, and I just tossed the garlic and asparagus into the butter/olive oil mixture at the same time. My garlic got a little burned before the asparagus was done. I added dried minced onion near the end, finished with the salt/pepper and lime juice, and topped with toasted cashews. I like the pan-fried asparagus taste, so some version of this will definitely go into my regular rotation.

This recipe was good.  I think the lime juice gave it an almost pickled taste, in a good way.  I used Kosher salt and lime juice (didn't have a fresh lime) and it worked out well.

This was a great addition to my meal.  I added more of the shallots and rushing to feed the hubby, I did forget the lime juice.  It was still a winner and I had to fix another batch because he wanted it the next day for lunch at work!  Thanks a lot!!!!  This is a keeper in my household.

Wow, SO GOOD!  My hubby is not overly fond of asparagus, so I took advantage and scaled the recipe down to make for just me at lunch.  I love the addition of the lime juice, gives it a nice fresh zing!  This takes no time at all to prepare (I found the cook time perfect), it's easy, healthy and delicious, can't wait to have it again (and I think my husband would enjoy it!).  The only thing I would do differently is to add my garlic closer to the end of the 5 mins of cooking instead of the beginning.  Perfect, thanks!

My boyfriend now loves asparagus because of this recipe!  I've made this a few times now, and used both lemon and lime juice. It's delicious either way! I use a little more garlic than the recipe calls for, and I sprinkle Parmesan cheese over it right after I take it out of the skillet.   This is a quick, simple, and healthy side dish that goes great with chicken!

This was fantastic!  The only thing I substitued was white onion for the shallots.  My husband thought this was the best asparagus he'd ever had.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy! Of course pairing garlic and asparagus is a no brainer.  Loved the mild shallot flavor and the hint of citrus with the lime.  Use fresh ground pepper and salt to taste with the lime juice.

Blanch, boiling water bath for about 1 minute, the asparagus then Shock, Ice water bath until cold again, before you saute.  Then, you will have the beautiful color with less crunch.

Very tasty and simple. Be sure to use a large skillet. I substituted yellow onion cut in strips instead of green onion. They caramalized nicely and were so tasty mixed in with the asparagus. We couldn't really taste the lime so might add more next time.

Made these for Christmas and was a huge hit. However, 1/4 lime didn't quite make, I added the juice from the whole lime to get the flavor. Will be making again.

Tasted pretty good, but maybe a little too much lime for my taste.  The only thing that I changed was that I used green onions instead of shallot.  Also, I cooked for much longer than 5 minutes, at least 10 minutes.

The addition of lime to this simple asparagus recipe was perfect. Will definitely make again. I've changed my rating from 4 stars to five stars now that I've made this recipe a dozen times. I keep going back to the fresh kick of citrus! This has become a staple recipe in my home.

This was a delicious side dish with a grilled chicken dinner. I modified it slightly out of necessity - I used onion in place of shallots as I had none. After cooking the asparagus for about 2 minutes, I added a splash of cold water and put a lid on my pan. This helps it to cook evenly without the garlic burning in the pan. I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

I was looking for a new way to cook asparagus.. and this is it!! I stuck with the lime and it gave it, along with the butter, a nice, rich flavor. And the 7 year old ate it (enough said!)

The asparagus tasted great, and the lime was a welcome kick. Used a green onion instead of a shallot and it worked well. I covered the asparagus once it was added to the pan to help the cooking and it turned out just right.

Yummiest way to make asparagus!  My kids gobbled up several stalks each!  I blanched and dried the asparagus first to maintain the beautiful green color.  Then it only took a couple of minutes in the skillet.  So easy and so good!

This was so good and so easy!  I didn't have any shallots, so I just sprinkled a little onion powder in with the minced garlic. I've always steamed asparagus and usually have leftovers.  No leftovers this time!  Thanks to your recipe, I will never look at asparagus the same way again!

I had this for lunch one day along with some sticky rice. It was quite tasty. There was a peculiar after-taste which might have been the lime juice.

I love new ways of cooking vegetables besides the usual steaming.  The whole family loved it and the lime was especially noticed and appreciated by the husband.

My husband and son are not big asparagus fans, but this recipe has them actually requesting it.  The only thing I changed is to add a bit of cajun spices (actually Emeril's Bayour Blast) to the pan at the end with just enough time to mix it in.

This was the first item to disappear from our dinner table! It was rated 'delicious' by all 11 at the table, even though I overcooked it because DH likes it that way. I will definitely serve again because it is 1) delicious and 2) very quick and easy!

Excellent!  I added two more cloves of garlic.  I cooked it for about 6 minutes.  Still just a bit crunchy.  It was easy, fast and I liked the lime added to it.  I served it with Sylvia's Ribs and Maria's Rice (both from this site). Would probably be great with fish too.

Delish!  The lime added a wonderful flavor to the dish - I did simmer for about 20 minutes on low because I started it too quickly and it would have been done way too early for the rest of the meal.  It turned out great.  I also threw in a few cashews for a little crunch.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

This was very good, but I made a few changes to it the second time I cooked it that make it even better.  Instead of butter I used a teaspoon of sesame oil. ( The flavor is very concentrated so you don't need much which makes this lower in fat )  I also added a tablespoon of soy sauce while cooking, and doubled the lime juice.  Absolutey delicious !

Very good and easy. I will be making soon again! Tip: you'll need to take the onions out after cooked, and leave the asparagus cooking in pan for a little while longer (the asparagus was too hard, given the time that the recipe called for)

I was intrigued by the lime aspect of the recipe and found the flavor to complement well with the asparagus. Substituted green onion for the shallot by finely slicing the whites, then slicing length ways and quartering the greens. Thanks for another fine addition to the asparagus segment of the recipe box

I was a little skeptical as to whether the asparagus/lime flavors would work, and was actually pleasantly surprised. The first couple of mouthfuls took a bit of getting used to, but we thought it was a good and interesting combination. Thanks!

This is a fabulous side. I loved the lime flavor for my tropical themed dinner. Even had a guest who'd never eaten asparagus before and loved it! LOL! I'll use it again. Only sub. was to use coconut oil in place of olive.

Everyone loved it. I didn't have shallots, so I substituted 2 green onions, plus I doubled-up on the garlic for more flavor. Also, I set the temperature to medium-high to brown the garlic and asparagus and for 3 of the 5 minute cook time, I covered the pan for more even cooking. I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious.  Next time I will add the asparagus sooner to the garlic and shallots to avoid over cooking garlic and shallots. Fresh lime adds a refreshing kick to the fresh asparagus.

This was absolutely fabulous!   I minced a fresh white onion to cook with the fresh garlic -- otherwise I made it as directed.  I served it with baked Mahi Mahi and carribbean rice.  Magnificent!

Awesome way to cook asparagus! I didn't have shallots so I used an onion...other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I served this along side chicken with pineapple coconut rice...it was perfect! Can't wait to make this again!

So easy and delicious! I served it with the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken that I found on here and they were the perfect combination! Couldn't have asked for a better side dish to compliment the chicken! The only change i made was used 2 tablespoons of minced white onion instead of the shallot.

This recipe has become a staple at my home! The lime adds such a refreshing element to this recipe. I served this at Thanksgiving when I was "assigned" the vegetable and all the picky eaters loved it! I did leave out the shallot simply because I had a hard time finding one in a pinch but this is the best way I have ever had asparagus.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it came out a little oily/buttery. It tasted excellent! I might try the steaming a little with chicken broth next time.

This was good, a little "dry" for me in the sauteeing section so I added some veggie broth to make some steam and covered to cook it to tenderness desired. Came out wonderful though.

This would be a 4.5 if possible; very good but not the absolute best. I agree with other reviewers: use more lime! I used half the juice of one lime and it was just right. I also used the white parts of one bunch of green onions instead of a shallot. If you sautee the asparagus for just five minutes, it comes out rather crisp, which I liked. If you like yours softer, cook it a bit longer.

Good. I have been eating this stuff for years with just Mayo. This is a nice change. The only problem I had is when I put the asparagus in after cooking the garlic. The garlic started to burn. Otherwise the garlic was white. Not really sure why... but otherwise it was good.. just didn't eat the garlic chunks. cooked in like 10 minutes... I like mine tender soft... not just tender.   I will do this one again for sure. :)

I adore asaparagus, and it needs so little to be great. I had never thought to use a spritz of lime instead of lemon, but I'm glad that someone did! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recently for company dinner to go with a baked ham and it was a huge hit! Everyone said it was the best asparagus they ever had. Didn't have a lime handy so substituted lemon juice.

This was very good but not quite enough lime to really taste like anything other than garlic asparagus.  I will double the lime next time.

I made a lime-themed dinner the other night, and included this recipe as the vegetable.  I completely forgot to add the lime at the end, but didn't even realize it until much later because it was so, so good.  I had a hard time finding shallots, but am glad I took the extra time to go to another store to find them because they added so much to the dish!  Will definitely make again -- maybe tonight!

Perfect fresh asparagus recipe.  It tastes just like Florida sunshine feels!  The fresh lime juice makes this dish.  We used as a side dish to veal piccata, it complemented the lemon flavor of the veal - there wasn't one bite left, thank you so much for a great recipe

We had an abundance of great asparagus from the farmer's market, and we're always looking for different ways to cook up asparagus to entice my son to eat more of it! He loved it! Pairs wonderfully with chili-peach grilled chicken.

This was just ok in my opinion. I doubled the lime, and it still didn't taste very "limey". I will try another recipe for asparagus next time.

The tangy lime and sweet onion compliment each other very well in my opinion. I used onion instead of shallots and used mostly olive oil with only a touch of butter. I also sprinkled a bit of cheese at the end - quite delicious! 

Next time I will probably start the asparagus first because the onion and garlic got quite crispy towards the end.

Great recipe.  Cooked asparagus for about 7 minutes, added more lime juice.  Good flavor, nice twist to traditional steamed asparagus.

Loved this recipe! I covered the pan while cooking the asparagus (used very thin spears) & they were al dente in just a little over 6 minutes. I did sprinkle a bit of shredded swiss cheese on & it was a GREAT addition. Paired very well w/ Orange-Glazed Pork Chops (from this site). Thansk for the recipe!

Turned out delicious, but needs more than 5 min cooking time for asparagus. I left mine in for 15 min or so in a covered skillet.

I definitely had to cook the asparagus for longer than the recipes suggests, and I ended up cutting them in 1/2 in the pan. Using a large enough pan for the spears to fit is crucial, it helped in preventing the shallots & garlic from burning. Maybe it was the lime, but I couldn't quite taste the lime flavor, I think next time I'd use 1/2 lime..or more.

Cooking for a VERY picky family, finding good vegetable recipe. But this one was an absolute hit! Even with the 5 and 6 year olds!!

I didn't have any shallots, so I made it without. Might try it with shallots next time.

I regularly make grilled asparagus, but I usually just use oil and garlic. I thought it would make it better by trying this recipe out and using lime. I was wrong, I'll stick to just garlic from now on!

Really great fresh taste with added zest from lime and garlic--just be sure not to overcook.

I’m always looking for new ways to cook vegetables and really like this recipe.  One of my nephews liked it, but the other didn’t.  All the adults liked it.  I’ll make it again.

Finally a vegetable I'll eat that isn't smothered in cheese!  This is really good. I had to cook a bit longer for the asparagus to be soft enough, though.

This is great and it made me realize how much I love grilled asperagus, but regular aaspergus is good with out all the effort.
