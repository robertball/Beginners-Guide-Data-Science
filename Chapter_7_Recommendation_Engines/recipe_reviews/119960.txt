I made a test run on this recipe before company came for Christmas. It was good, but I wasn't as big a fan of that much Swiss cheese. So for Christmas I used 3/4 cup Swiss and 2 1/2 cups cheddar cheese and added green pepper for extra flavor. Everyone raved about it! It was sooo good. One thing I also did differently the second time is fry the bacon in strips and then crumble. The first time the pieces wouldn't fry completely and were stacked on top of each other, so they turned out half crisp, half soggy. It worked much better to cook them in strips and then fry the onion in a little bit of the grease afterwords.

I often hesitate to make some of these breakfast casseroles because they are so heavy and make me want to crawl back into the bed and go back to sleep. This casserole tasted delicious and didn't make me sleepy.  I think because it doesnt have refined starchy things in it. I am very happy to have this recipe.  I freeze little individual  containers of it to have all week long.

This is a GREAT recipe! I used a pound of sausage instead of bacon. I didn't have quite two cups of cheddar cheese, so I used a little extra swiss. It got rave reviews from my very picky husband! His parents also loved it, and have already asked for the recipe. My only complaint was the serving size. I served it as a main dish with biscuits on the size. It fed four, with a little left over. Could have fed five adults, no 12.

This recipe was fabulous.  I made 2 casseroles for 6 people.  I made one of the casseroles bacon & the other sausage.  The bacon one was gone first.  Though the sausage one was delicious, the bacon one was clearly the hit.  Everyone enjoyed a second helping.  I believe it is the cottage cheese & swiss cheese that make this recipe.  I followed the recipe perfectly.  I made no changes to the ingredients, however, I did broil the casseroles for 5 minutes at the end of the baking cycle to brown the top.  The next morning when my guests awoke, I said lets go to breakfast...but they requested we have leftover breakfast casserole instead!  There was plenty leftover to feed everyone again & it reheated beautifully.

This is the first time I have ever rated a recipe and it is only because this recipe was so good.  This has been the breakfast cassorole that I have been looking for over the years.  I do not know if it is the swiss cheese and the cottage cheese combo or what but it is wonderful.  I did vary it a little just because of my own taste.  I used southern style potatoes and seasoned them not only with salt and pepper but also with a little cayenne pepper and garlic salt.  I also added one more egg just to extended the recipe a little further and the last item I changed is instead of bacon, I used sausage.  The changes I made really reflect my own taste.  Again this was the best breakfast recipe I have ever found!

This is a wonderful recipe! I love how easy it is! I made it for guests and it got a lot of great comments. The swiss cheese really adds a nice taste to the dish. My son doesn't really care for straight egg frittatas but really enjoyed this one with the added potatoes and asks for it a lot now. I wanted to make it more often yet didn't really want to keep frozen hash browns as a staple in my house. I found out that using a couple cold baked potatoes from a previous meal and grating them (this is very easy when they are cold - I even leave the skins on them!), works even better than the frozen ones! I just plan to make a couple extra baked potatoes the day before I make this for breakfast. We also use pre-cooked turkey bacon in place of the regular bacon and it turns out great. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I was a little scared of the cottage cheese - almost did not add it.  I'm glad I did.  This is super moist and very good.  I used moz. cheese instead of the swiss.

This is it!  This is the breakfast casserole I've been looking for!  I made it exactly according to the recipe, and it is perfect.  I always prefer to add salt and pepper when eating, as opposed to when cooking, so I didn't find it bland (but it did need the salt & pepper).  I can see how easy it would be to customize this according to personal tastes.  I will probably never make any other breakfast casserole again...Why mess with perfection?  :)

This will be our new favorite breakfast casserole recipe.  We wanted something that didn't use bread or canned soup and this fit the bill. We did substitute bob evans zesty sausage for the bacon.  Added tsp salt, garlic,and onion powder.  Great meal!

I must have read all 227 reviews over and over the past couple of weeks before deciding on this dish for Easter Brunch.  Well, the company is gone and as most reviewers agreed, this dish was a hit. I wanted to post my review while my impressions were still fresh.  I had made up my mind to go with additional eggs right from the beginning based on other reviewers comments and started with 10. But once I began to mix everything together I decided to throw in a couple more eggs bringing the total to 12 and cannot see how you can possibly use less eggs. Less eggs and it would be a potato casserole. I also used only 3 cups of hash browns using the Simply Potatoes Southwest Style refrigerated hash browns and elimated the medium onion the recipe called for.  I only added a little pepper because cheese and bacon are pretty salty on their own. I prepared it the night before and let it come to room temp in the morning which was perfect. What a time saver.  I think next time I would like to try spreading the potatoes on the bottom of the pan as one reviewer suggested and pouring the egg mixture on top. This is really a great dish.... very delicious and truly a 5 star brunch casserole.

I made two of these for my annual Christmas brunch this year.  For both, I first sauteed  a chopped green and a chopped red pepper with the onion for color and flavor.  For one casserole I used 1/2 pound each bacon (which I fried by itself and then cooled and crumbled) and breakfast sausage which I browned first.  For the other casserole I did a veggie version using a ton of sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter and a large shredded zucchini.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, using a really fantastic Jarlsberg swiss since my husband and I love swiss cheese so much (oh and since I made two I cooked for them at the same time for one hour).  Both versions were excellent and made a fantastic offering to veggie and meat eaters alike.  I served along side brie en croute, fresh cut fruit, bacon, orange juice, coffee, an assortment of Christmas cookies and my handmade truffles. Every year I try something different but I think I'll include one version of this casserole from now on.  I think they'd be great baked up in well-greased muffin tins for individual servings as well!

My family loves this.   It is so much easier to cook the bacon if you cut it into little pieces first -- I use kitchen shears to cut across the short end of the bacon.  It cooks faster & then you don't have to deal with crumbling it while it is hot.

Ahhh, thank you Beth!   Finally a breakfast casserole without bread (this is also a gluten free casserole!).  Some observations.   First, the serving size of this recipe (AS WRITTEN) is off... it's not 12, it's 6 servings.  Even though it's in a big pan, it's thin.   Also, some reviewers say the hash browns don't get done, which is true if you are using the packaged FRESH hash browns in the dairy section.  The recipe calls for FROZEN hash browns which are not as thick as the fresh.  Also, don't forget to increase your bake time if you add 6 more eggs (which it really does need, or the name of this recipe would need to be changed to potato casserole).  Mine needed a total of 50 mins on 350, and it was not dry at all.  One last tip -- if you like more bland type food this is for you.  However, I needed more flavor, so I used spanish instead of sweet onion, added shallots, diced fire roasted tomatoes, dry mustard, and used 2 pounds of bacon.   All of this while still using the original 4 cups of potatoes.   Freezes very well, and I take a square to work for breakfast every day... soooo good.  Thanks for the great recipe  :-)

I really liked this recipe. Brought it to a brunch and it was enjoyed by all.  I followed some suggestions and added more eggs (10 in total) and shredded my own potatoes (not much work considering the savings, it was 2 large potatoes). I used veggie breakfast sausages and would probably add a little salt if making it vegetarian but if using bacon, ham or meat sausage it would be fine. I assembled the night before and baked in the AM, next time I would bake at night and just warm in the oven in the AM.

Very tasty and easy to prepare and change around. I made this the night before and put in the refrigerator and then cooked it in the AM.  I will try tomatoes and sausage next time. Everybody enjoyed this as is. Thanks for submitting!

Fabulous. My go-to recipe I use all the time now - have even made enough to feed 80+ people, two different times! I use sausage, throw in some bacon bits for added flavor, use Monterey Jack/Colby mix instead of Swiss, and use southwestern style hash browns (with peppers & onions) instead of dicing/cooking onions.  I also do 7 eggs.  Get asked for the recipe constantly - total hit! Thanks!!

The whole family LOVES this breakfast casserole. We did as many other reviews suggested and used 12 eggs.   We love the versatility of the recipe - it'll work with any meat or cheese you have around. We've made this several times with either ham, bacon, or breakfast sausage. Also, we've used mozzarella instead of swiss at times.   Can be made and refrigerated the night before, but it will take longer to bake if you put it in the oven right from the fridge, so allow some extra time.

Great simple recipe.  I have made it three times.  The last time I made it, I cooked it in muffin tins for individual servings.  I froze them to take out each morning for breakfast.

This was truly fantastic! I made it for my in-laws' visit at Christmas, so I needed something quick, tasty and presentable. I used leftover bacon that I just chopped up and then sauteed with the onion (and added garlic). I was really afraid of the cottage cheese because we aren't big fans of it plain but decided to go for it. You can't tell it is there but the flavor is amazing, so don't leave it out! I also added chili powder and really liked the "pop" it gave. My cheese preference was half Cheddar and half Colby Jack, with some Parmesan just for fun. Also, for lack of time, I used pre-shredded potatoes (found in the egg section).  I made this the night before and cooked it in the morning, which added about 15 minutes to the cook time.  Super versatile, easy to prep, can make ahead and tasty!

I mixed this up the night before and baked it in the morning.  It worked great, although I had to bake it for an hour (at 350) before it was really set.  I omitted the bacon, but neglected to add more salt so it was a little bland.  Next time, I think I will add the bacon or sausage.  Also, instead of chopping onion, I used frozen potatoes o'brian that had the onions in it as well as red and green peppers.  They added nice flavor.  Overall, this was good and I would make it again.

Made this for Thanksgiving breakfast. Replaced the swiss with a little more cheddar and mozz. I also used Egg Beaters. It turned out awesome and everyone loved it! One thing to keep in mind, do try to eat this when it's still hot & straight from the oven. It wasen't quite as good as it cooled off some.

This was good. Not terrific but good. The only change I made was I omitted the bacon and instead put Morning Star veggie breakfast sausage. My husband enjoyed it.

SUPER YUMMY!! Made once per recipe and it was great. Then made "southwest" one with sausage instead of bacon, pepper jack for the swiss and threw in a green pepper with the onion. Both were excellent.

Very simple to throw together and very delicious. I used half egg beaters, half real eggs. low fat cheeses and ham instead of bacon. It received rave reviews from the entire family. I WILL be revisiting this recipe soon!

This was awesome!  I stayed as close to the original recipe as I could with a few minor changes to suit personal taste.  Neither my husband or I care for onions, so I omitted them and instead used 1/2 t. onion powder to add flavor.  I also added 1/2 t. ground black pepper and 1/4 t. salt.  I added these to the egg mixture before adding the remaining ingredients.  I saw that many people were adding, sometimes DOUBLING, the amount of eggs, but I decided that with so many good reviews from people who cooked this "as is" I would give it a go without this change and stuck to 6 eggs.  It turned out lovely!  However, I do think the next time I make this (there will be a next time, it was very yummy!) I will add two more eggs.  With 6 eggs you get a faint hint of egg flavor and both my husband and I agreed this would be even better with just a bit more egg to suit our personal taste.  I recommend trying this recipe out making only minor changes for personal taste and preference, then judge for yourself if further changes are needed.  I can't imagine this being nearly as good with a full dozen eggs!  It was excellent "as is".  Definately a keeper and a nice switch from the typical strata recipe!

I've made this recipe in many different versions. This is a fabulous  basic recipe to start though. That's why I gave it 5 stars.

I always use the Ore Ida O'Brien hash browns. I usually cook those in a pan with a bit of oil and onions. I like to get them crisp first. I don't like soggy potatoes in my casserole. I cut up a couple pieces of ham steak, shred some sharp cheese and a little swiss cheese. I never have used the cottage cheese. My family dislikes it. I mix all of that with 8 eggs and just dump it in the greased 9x13 pan. Sometimes I make it the night before and bake it in the morning. If I do that then I'll bake it about an hour at 350 degrees. If I bake it right away I bake it about 50 minutes. If I happend to have leftovers......not often, I'll cut it up and freeze it in thin strips to use for fast breakfast burritos on the go or a quick sandwich between toasted English Muffins. My family loves the recipe. Especially for special holidays like Christmas and Easter morning. I've also made it for dinner which they all seem to love after a long day at work and school. Thanks for the basic recipe Beth!!

I made this for my family that was in from out of town for Christmas. It was sooo good! I only used chedder cheese though so im not sure how it would be with swiss and cottage cheese. Im sure you could toss in whatever flavors you want. This would be a great way to use up left over ham from christmas. I top mine with a little tabasco. NICE!

My favorite breakfast casserole!  I've made this several times and I usually make it on Christmas morning for an easy treat!    I now put this together in the evening (fully assembled) and then sit it in the fridge overnight.  I pull it out in the morning and put it in the oven as it's preheating, then bake 35-40 mins as recipe suggests.  Perfect everytime!    Thanks for a great recipe!

Just like Cracker Barrel!  I made this recipe like written....(but some of my bacon was burnt so I had to throw away some of the bacon....so I threw in some diced ham to make up for it).  Also, I used 8 eggs instead of 6 eggs.  I also broiled it for 5 minutes after cooking to brown the top.  So, after making this recipe mostly as written, I tried it and it was delicious!  Only after I ate some of this, I discovered that it tastes very similiar to (but better than)  the hash brown casserole that is famous at the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Restaurants!!  I actually work at Cracker Barrel.  I was not even looking to replicate their recipe for hash brown casserole, but this is very similiar, except theirs has no meat or eggs in it.  THANK YOU for this recipe.  I will be making it often.

This is a FABULOUS recipe.  The only things I changed were the number of eggs (10 instead of 6) and I added mozzarella cheese to the mix. The whole casserole was almost gone in 20 mins with everyone saying how wonderful this is. I prepared it the night before and baked it in the morning. A KEEPER!!

I made this on Thanksgiving morning for my out of town guests and everybody was begging for the recipe.  I used the breakfast sausage instead of the bacon and it was so terrific that I keep craving it.  This recipe is a keeper!!

This was okay but very heavy. I made it with sausage crumbles instead of bacon. I felt uncomfortable the rest of the day from how full and heavy this was. I make an egg bake with crescent dough as the crust that I got from the owners of a B&B in Michigan. It's much better than this -- light and just right for breakfast on a Sunday morning. I'll stick to that one.

I LOVE this stuff! I love that I can prep it the night before and just throw it in the oven in the morning! You can add anything to this and it's good. Sometimes I make it with sausage and add spinach other times I make sausage gravy to put on top of it! You can tweek it however you want and it still turns out great. Thanks for sharing!

I wish I could give this 10 stars! We used sausage and, because I ran out of swiss, had to use a little habanero shredded cheese, but the casserole turned out absolutely great! It surprised me not to add salt, pepper or any other seasonings, but was glad I didn't. I baked ours in 2 8-inch pans to "eat one, freeze one". Thanks so much for the recipe - we'll use it often!

Versatile recipe and very delicious. I make it with southern style HB's, bulk Italian sausage (spicy), half cheddar and half mozzarella cheese, bell pepper, onion.  Very similair to a Denver omelet. I bake half in a 9 X 9 pan and the other half in greased foil cupcake liners (in muffin tin). They are easy to take to work in the lunch bag. Next time I will make a southwestern version using chorizo, roasted and diced poblano peppers, onion, diced red bell pepper and shredded pepper jack cheese. I also use the cottage cheese as listed in the recipe.

I've been making this casserole for Christmas morning for about 10 years.  It's part of our family tradition.  I typically don't like breakfast casseroles with bread as the starch so that was what drew me to this casserole.  I've made it with regular bacon, turkey bacon, and mild and spicy sausage.  It's always great!

Just a hint for the bacon - when I am making breakfast casseroles etc that require the bacon to be crumbled or diced up - I find it easier to slice the bacon before I cook it...then I just dump it in the frying pan and keep stirring it and use a slotted spoon to remove from the grease. I just find it alot easier than flipping strips and not being able to fit a whole pound of bacon in the pan at once. Just my two cents worth - this recipe looks awesome! I am making it this weekend!

Excellent recipe! I added 2 extra eggs and  combined maple breakfast sausage & bacon. Everyone loved it, thanks!

Note- I made this the day before and it stored fine in the fridge and came out perfect.

I have made this at least a half dozen times.  Although I don't personally like eggs, there is never any left and folks go back for seconds and always request the recipe.  I also add black pepper and sometimes add green pepper, if I have it on hand.

This is our favorite special occasion breakfast cassarole. Works great as a do-ahead and IF there's any leftovers it re-heats superbly the next day.  We love it just as it is in the recipe except my Grandma always taught me to salt and pepper eggs unless we were making sweets. This is the best Christmas morning breakfast!  I've stirred it up and it's in the fridge waiting to be baked in the morning.

Delicious! I do NOT like Swiss cheese, but with the rest of the ingredients in this recipe, it goes perfectly! I found I needed to add 3 more eggs for a total of 9 and I'm glad I did. I made my bacon in the oven and fried up my onion in a little olive oil on the stove...chopped up my bacon and simmered it together. Then I threw all the ingredients together the night before for time-saving purposes so I would just need to pop it in oven in the morning. I needed to bake it about 10 minutes longer, but that could have been because I added 3 extra eggs. GREAT FLAVOR!

Loved this breakfast casserole but I changed it ever so slightly. Since Hatch chilis are in season right now, I added 1/3 cup of roasted, chopped-up peppers and the taste was amazing without being too spicy!! Will be making this often when I have company. I made it up the night before, popped it in the oven in the morning and it still came out fabulous.

WONDERFUL casserole. The best breakfast casserole I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. It is very light and fluffy, the only thing I did differently is I used a pound of sausage instead of bacon, I used shredder Colby & Monterrey jack cheese instead of swiss, added an extra egg and I used hash browns that already had peppers and onions mixed in, so yummy my husband and 23 month old ate it  up :)

I used 9 eggs and extra cheese, but this still seemed a bit dry.  Next time I'll put cheese on top and make a sauce or something.  I used sausage, mushrooms and onions also.

WONDERFUL meal ... measured everything out the night before (cooked bacon/onion, grated cheese, defrosted hash brown shreds) so that it was a quick assembly in the morning. Went a bit lighter on the cheese, and it was still plenty cheesy.  Definitely a recipe worth keeping

This was very good. My husbandwent back for thirds! I used turkey breakfast sausage and 10 eggs in a 9x13 dish and It was great. I am curious what it would have been like if I had used the 6 eggs the recipe called for...hmm?

This is my favorite breakfast casserole that I make over and over for guests, for my Sunday School class and whenever I need to make something easy for breakfast.  Its so versatile!  I use cooked potatoes instead of hash browns and I chop them up and brown them with the onions and occasionally I throw in chopped green peppers. My family does not care for swiss cheese, so I always use a cheddar, but any favorite cheese may be used. I will cook it the night before in a large rectangular metal pan, then pop it in the oven to warm up the next morning.  Its so much better than the soggy casserole made with bread and everyone who has tried it always finds it delicious!

This is really delicious and easy to make.  I confess that I did modify it somewhat - I used pre-cooked bacon and added the sauteed onions later, which really helped on prep and clean up.  I was planning on following the recipe exactly, but it looked really dry with only six eggs.  I ended up using 12, and it was perfect.  The reason for the four stars instead of five is because of the hash browns - even though they were thawed, they didn't really cook well.  I will brown them before mixing next time.  Overall, really, really good.

Good but not great.  Doubling the eggs is a must or else you'll get one stiff casserole.  I made it to a T the first time - too stiff and too much hash browns.  The 2nd time, I doubled the eggs and used only 3 cups of hash browns.  This yielded a more tender casserole.  Using sausage in the casserole and sprinkling chopped cooked bacon on top makes a tasty and good looking dish.  I will make again with the revisions.

We served this over Thanksgiving. Even my picky eaters wanted seconds, it was so delicious!  We think the bacon and onion combination made it special. The family was disappointed I didn't make enough for thirds!!!  Needless to say, we are serving it again over Christmas.

I cooked the bacon and prepared/assembled everything in the greased baking dish the night before, and baked it in the morning and it turned out perfectly.  That was a great morning time-saver.  When doing it this way I took the dish out of the refridgerator about 15 minutes before putting it in the oven to take some of the chill off, and I also baked it for the full 40 minutes since it was oviously cold going into the oven.  It turned out perfectly and done throughout and everyone loved it.  I served this with hot buttered coissants, and mimosas and it served 5 people easily plus left plenty of leftovers for at least 4 more people. It's great as leftovers too.  I will try this with breakfast sausage the next time just to see which way works better.  Susage needs to be cooked and drained throughly to render the fat out of it and prevent the casserole from becoming too greasy.  This is a great recipe as is, I did not change a thing other than assembling it the night before.  Will definitely make again!

This is so delicious!  I have made it several times, but this time, I wanted to take them camping and have an easy, reheat option for breakfast.  I mixed everything as directed, then put it in muffin cups and baked it.  When they cooled, I froze them.  We took them out during our camping trip as we wanted and reheated them in the microwave.  They were absolutely wonderful!

I just made this recipe this morning for my Husband's birthday. I wanted something special for breakfast that I don't usually make. I've never made a breakfast casserole before and this came out AWESOME! I made some small changes, which anyone can do, it's the beauty of dishes like this... you can tweak it in many ways to your liking.   All I changed was adding a couple more eggs (8 total-I wanted leftovers), I also added a bit of chopped spinach- glad I did, it looked beautiful... and instead of onion (Hubby hates reg. onions) I used onion powder and a little chopped green onion.  I do, however, agree with other posters that say this dish does NOT feed 12. There is only 2 of us, I used this as the main dish w/english muffins, and my Hubby ate a huge piece. So, I would seriously recommend that this 12 servings only serves 5-6 adults if it's the main dish. And let's hope they aren't all men with big appetites! I'd say it would serve 8 women and maybe 5-6 men.  Now if it's just part of a big breakfast meal or you're all light eaters, then sure you can cut it into 12 decent size servings. (and remember I used 8 eggs too!)   This will be a staple for me now, I'm so happy I found this recipe... home run on the first try!

Oh. My. God.  DELICIOUS!!!  I made this for dinner as a trial run for Christmas morning and it was amazing (and amazingly easy)!!!  I used 1 lb. turkey bacon instead of regular bacon; there was less bacony flavor, as expected, but it was still yummy!  I used 1 large onion; I'd halve that next time as the dish was very oniony, which might not appeal to some.  I baked it for 45 minutes as it was still "wet" at 30 and 35.  It was even better the 2nd day and made for a yummy breakfast.  I made it into 8 servings; 12 seemed too small, unless there were a few side dishes.  Best of all, LiveStrong's recipe builder puts this at 447 calories per serving (at 8 servings, with turkey bacon).  Yummy and healthy; yay!
****
12/25/10: UPDATE.  Made 2 of these for Christmas, one with bacon, one with chopped up Italian sweet sausage.  Christmas Eve local hash brown shortage forced a change to Southern style hash browns (cubed potatoes) and chopped up tater tots.  Used 2 cups tots and 2 cups hash browns in lieu of 4 cups shredded hash browns; liked the outcome better!!!  LOTS of compliments and requests for a repeat performance.  :)

I've been making this recipe for years now and I am not a domestic diva.  So, anyone can make it.  I like to make Christmas Eve night.  I under cook it slightly and put it in the oven Christmas morning to finish, so there is no mess or fuss on this special morning!  You can do many things to vary this recipe according to different tastes.  I always use a dozen eggs and omit the potatoes.  I also use 'Real' bacon bits for ease.  I also add a can of mild green chiles.  Enjoy!

This is the ultimate breakfast - extremely filling and sustaining.  Liked it even better reheated the second day when all the flavors seemed to blend perfectly so I think it would be a great do-ahead breakfast for Christmas!

I fixed this for a church brunch. Everyone loved it! To simplify things, I used Hormel Bacon Crumbles, instead of frying my own bacon. (I followed the package recommendation for the quantity of bacon needed.)I just sauteed the diced onion in canola oil and stirred the bacon crumbles in at the end to infuse the flavor with the onion. I will definitely be making this again!

All I can say is WOW!  I made this at my cafe one day for a quick breakfast special.  One lady took a bite, then another, and ran back to me and said, "This is the best thing I have even put in my mouth!"  After an awkward pause I just smiled and said, "thank you!"  I did do two things differently - first I had leftover ham I wanted to use so I subbed that for the bacon.  Second I used a three cheese mix instead of all cheddar.  I also topped it with a bit of cheddar half way through cooking.  It is a regular on my menu now! :)

I usually make this for dinner rather than breakfast, and my husband loves it.  We're vegetarian, so I replace the bacon with either Morningstar sausage crumbles or homemade seitans ground up and seasoned with herbs de Provence, depending on what I have on hand.  I omit the Swiss cheese since I'm not a fan of it and use non-fat cottage cheese.  I don't bother thawing the hash brown potatoes very well, but it's never given me a problem.  A good casserole to make if you have house guests too since you can make it the night before and serve it for breakfast, and any leftovers reheat well.

I made this for a brunch party. I did add some extra eggs, but will add more next time, because I like the egg dish, not the potatoe dish taste. About 10 minutes before the dish was finished cooking, I added a layer of very thinly sliced tomatoes and sprinkled a light layer of shredded cheese over that. This gave it a nice presentation and a little bit of a fresh taste. Thanks, going to make it for my Christmas morning with my kids breakfast.

Terrific!  Add more eggs, if you want, up to a dozen if you don't want to double the recipe. You can replace cottage cheese with sour cream, but the flavor should stay around the same. You also can replace Swiss cheese with any other similar cheese you have available.

I have to join the more than 200 people who love this!!  I served more than 30 people this morning and the concensus - this is the best casserole we have had!  I will be making this again and again.  Couple of changes - cooked the bacon in the oven.  Used diced hash browns and cooked those with the onions.  Also, baked this the night before and then reheated in the microwave the next morning.  Can't imagine how good it would be baked that morning, considering how good it was reheated.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I made it for Christmas morning and my brother asked for the recipe.  I modified it a bit - like other users, I prefer a lighter, fluffier egg bake so I used 12 eggs (I wouldn't make it any other way).  I also added 3 cloves of garlic when frying the bacon and 2 chopped green onions (raw) to the egg mixture.  I wouldn't add any salt (the bacon was more than enough), but did add pepper.  I also only used 3 cups of the hash browns.  In a future try, I would add maybe 1/2 to 3/4 lb. bacon instead of the full pound.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made this for Christmas morning.  It is absolutely delicious!  So easy to make the night before and pop in the oven while we're unwrapping presents.  I think this will become a Christmas tradition.  The only thing I changed was to add a couple of extra eggs like other reviewers recommended.  A winner!

We absolutely loved this recipe! After reading reviews, I kept seeing people say that it was a bit bland. Since I am from the South and I definitely need some flavor, I changed it up a bit. I wanted this casserole to be more of an omelette-type, so I used 11 eggs instead of the 6. I can't imagine using any less. I also chopped up a green pepper and put it in the food processor until it came to a very fine puree. I also added a pound of hot Italian sausage since we are meat lovers. Also, instead of the shredded house browns, I opted for 3 cups of the diced potato hashbrowns. If you like just a hint of potato, I highly recommend this. I then baked it on 350 for 40 minutes and then broiled on high for 10 minutes. It came out perfect and with all the flavor that I was looking for! I will definitely be making this again!

This was excellent with a few changes I took from several different reviewers.  First, I used 8 XL eggs, but would increase that to a full dozen next time!  I can't imagine using only 6 like the recipe reads!  There was hardly enough with 8.  I did season the hash browns with a good amount of salt and pepper.  I also added a sprinkling of garlic powder.  Since I had to be somewhere early, I assembled it the night before, refrigerated it overnight, set it out for 1/2 hour before baking. It took about 45 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.  I loved the taste of the hashbrowns in it!  Very yummy.

I have a breakfast casserole but decided to try a new one.  This was soooo delicious that it is now our family's new favorite.  I too used sausage instead of bacon, but next time I'll try the bacon.  I also took it to a ladies gathering and heard many great compliments.  It's truly a keeper!!

I made this the morning after Thanksgiving for family along with a banana nut loaf.  Everyone raved about it.  I did use Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage in place of the bacon, and it was not at all too spicy.  I also added salt, pepper and onion powder as another reviewer suggested.  It got rave reviews.

Great breakfast casserole! I made this for our Life group class this morning with a few alterations.  I browned Turkey Bacon and pork sausage then crumbled both into the dish. (that's what I had on hand) I also used a dozen eggs, 2 tbsp of creme freshe', I used cheddar cheese, parmasean cheese instead of Swiss. I also added chopped green peppers, green onions, and jalapeños.  Then the other addition I made was I added 1 cup of bisquick mixed with 1/2 cup of half and half, and 2 tbsp of butter.  I seasoned with some garlic powder, black pepper, and salt.  Great flavor!

This was super easy to make.  It can be made the night before and then thrown in the oven for 20 minutes in the morning to heat it through.  Delicious.  And can be frozen to make great leftovers.  Will not dissapoint.

Very nice.  I cut the recipe in about half.  Plenty for 4 people with second helpings--single, good-sized servings for 6.  

I didn't have cottage cheese so added an extra egg and about 1/2 cup half-and-half (milk would work fine).  Took the advice of another reviewer and added diced sweet red pepper, sauteed with the onion, for extra flavor and color.   I also substituted link sausage, cooked and chopped.

Thank you for the new breakfast casserole idea.

Eating this as I type! I changed it up.  I used 8 slices extra thick bacon, 8 maple sausage links, 1/4 cup small diced ham, 2 cheeks from a green pepper, one cheek from a red pepper and  a yellow pepper, 7 eggs and 2 tbls asiago cheese. Everything else I left the same. 
Diced the peppers and onions. Cooked the bacon in strips and also cooked the sausage in separate pans. Once they were cooked I shredded the bacon and chopped up the sausage and set aside. I then drained some of the bacon fat and cooked the peppers and onions in the same pan that I cooked the bacon. After the veggies were done I added them to the already combined cheeses and potatoes. Then I added the meats and combined all of it. After scrambling the eggs in a bowl I added Paula Deen's House Seasoning to them. Then I poured them into the potatoes and mixed it all up while adding lots of black pepper and a little salt. I also added some of the soft fatty bacon to the top so it would get crispier in the oven. I baked it for 42 minutes until it was still gooey (from the cheese-not the eggs). I think many that feel the dish needs more eggs probably cooked it a little too long and the eggs and cheese got dry.  Mine still continued to cook as it sat waiting for it to settle. It was absolutely perfect by the time I cut and served. Next time I plan to use less cheddar because I am not a big cheddar lover in dishes anyway. Next time: american, mozzerella, and Tone's Cajun Seasoning! We loved this!

Bland. That is the word I would use to describe this dish, bland.  I wasn't sure what to rate it because it was alright, not great and not bad. I would eat more of the dish I simply would never cook it again or recommend it. Maybe if it had some peppers or different spicing to give it some flavor but at a certain point it is no longer the same recipe anymore.

This was very good.  I halfed the recipe, but used 4 eggs instead of three. Next time I might even use 5 as mine didn't end up very "eggy" and since it's for breakfast I would have liked the eggs to be more significant.  I also did not thaw the hashbrowns first, so I added 10 minutes to the cooking time and it came out perfect.

This Recipe has a nice taste. but for me, it is not what i consider a breakfast casserole. to me it is more like glorified hashbrowns. i could see using this as a side dish.--------***



(i had to do an update on this casserole. as i was not happy with this recipe. and almost ready to throw it out.  and i had made a double batch, and placed in a 11x15 casserole dish.  i decided to take it to work anyways. and guess what? all the casserole was ate, except one piece. no lie, i could not believe it. this is a true story. so now i am not sure how to rate it. but it was alot of casserole as i doubled that batch. and it was almost completely gone. so even though it was not one of my favorites, the majority did like it.)

This recipe is great, and a nice change from the "bread stratta casserole"  Don't omit the cottage cheese because I think that may be the secret ingredient that makes this recipe excel.  We all will add/delete according to personal preference, but the recipe as is, is great!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

YUM!  We loved this and will make again and again.  I didn't measure my bacon but just crumbled up about 10 slices.  So, mine needed more bacon, but come on...what couldn't use more bacon???  Also used green onions for a bit of color.  Browned the top on broil for 5 minutes at the end as well.  As a non-cottage cheese eating family no one could tell this had cottage cheese in it.  It's a keeper!

If I personally were giving this stars, it would be about 4, but because my guests scarfed it down and went back for seconds and thirds, it gets a five.  I made as stated with sausage.  I also made an all vegetable, which would have been better had I cooked the mushrooms longer prior to baking- it turned out a little watery.  Overall really easy recipe.  I made the night before and baked in the morning.

This is a favorite in our home.  I often substitute a package of frozen tater tots equivalent to the 4 cups of hash browns. You can also subsitute different cheeses if you don't have cheddar and swiss on hand, montery jack works well.  If you have "picky eaters" that do not like seeing or eating cottage cheese, blend it until it is really fine.  This way they will be none the wiser and it blends in well with the egg and cheese.  My son still does not know.... just eggs and other cheese as far as he is concerned.  A great recipe and is always hit at our house!

It was great. I did everything the night before except baking it. The next day I took the baking dish out of the fridge, mixed it a little, preheated the oven & baked it. It turned out very nice.

As per the other reviewers, I added 2 more eggs & 3 dashes of salt & pepper to taste. I baked the bacon in the oven (less mess) & sauteed the onions in some of the bacon grease. By mistake I grabbed the Orelda cubed potatoes Obrien with peppers & onions and it still worked well. I baked it at 350 for 1 hour. Next time I will bake for 55 minutes.

Thanks for posting this recipe! It's a keeper.

Easter Brunch 2011 and it was a huge success. So easy and so good. Added chopped green chiles and subbed out the swiss for a Mexican blend of cheese. Also used sausage instead of the bacon since that was being served on the side.

I love making this. This is a very flexible recipe if you have meat-lovers and non-meat-lovers. I have not used the bacon and used red bell peppers once and cooked it with the onion. I have also used spinach too with some garlic and cooked it with the onion. The men in my life love it when I double up on the meat and do bacon and sausage. The fillings can change very easily. Hands down... a crowd pleaser.

I make breakfast once a month for 10-12 guys (deacons in our church). I made a bacon version and a sausage version of this casserole today. Both were well-received; several of the men asked me to give the recipe to their wives. My changes: drained off fat before cooking the onion; added garlic & mushrooms. Used 11 eggs per casserole. Assembled casseroles the night before and refrigerated. Took casseroles out of the fridge while oven pre-heated. Baked casseroles for 45 minutes. Served with fresh fruit and coffee cake. Absolutely delicious!

I made this for dinner last night for the first time. I followed the recipe exactly except I baked my bacon in the oven and then crumbled it and put it in the casserole. (It just seems easier to me because I can cook all the bacon at one time this way.) This was absolutely DELICIOUS. This is a recipe I will make over and over again. I baked mine in a glass 9x13 pan.

AWESOME!  I cut the recipe in half, since I only had 4 to feed. I started to make it, then realized I didn't have frozen hashbrowns!  I peeled and grated 3 large potatoes instead and it worked just fine!  great recipe, will definitely make again.

This was a big hit on for our Christmas Breakfast.  We have some vegetarians so I left out the bacon.  It was still a big hit and the first casserole that was completely gone.  Everyone enjoyed it vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.

This tasted amazing!  I did do sausage in place of bacon, but next time I will try bacon.  I made this for a brunch for my husband and his mom and his mom's husband.  Everyone would not stop complimenting it!  We only had to small servings left from the 9x13 pan.  Wow!  This is one of my favorite breakfast casseroles ever.  Everything was perfect together and there wasn't too much of anything.  Just perfect!

Made for Christmas breakfast but the prep time took much longer to do.  I cooked breakfast sausage and then diced in small pieces.  It was very good and will make again.

Made it for dinner and the husband loved it.  Used Trader Joe's hashbrowns and they also had shredded swiss & guyere cheese.  The husband has now requested it for X-mas brunch over the usual ham/cheese casserole!

We served this at a potluck and it was gone within 5 minutes. After reading reviews, I added an egg and used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss. I used Oreida shredded potatoes. Next time, I would try sausage instead of bacon and add diced green pepper.

This was good, but a little too cheesy for me and trust me that is hard because I'm a huge cheese lover!  The swiss was overpowering and to me, made it a little funky.  But - it's your own personal taste, for me 3 stars.

This recipe was just okay, not great. I made a half recipe and baked it in a 1 1/2 quart baking dish. I left out both the bacon and the swiss cheese. I added salt, pepper, and a 1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder. I found it really bland and boring, even if I used bacon and swiss cheese it still would  have been boring. This recipe needs ALOT more spices and ingrediants to make it good. I'm not going to make this again, sorry. Update: Just for everyone to know I read some reviews for this recipe and other people left out both the bacon and swiss cheese and they gave this dish 5 stars. So if I haven't of read those positive reviews I wouldn't have made this dish, and would of tried another recipe.

Thanks for this, much lighter and less salty than bakes with soup and sour cream. Family liked it!  I made half the recipe in an 8x8 casserole, used eggbeaters and real eggs for an equivalent of 4 eggs, sharp cheddar and a sprinkle of mozzarella since I didn't have swiss cheese. I also used the cubed hash browns since that's what I had, added a bit of diced orange pepper with the onion (I only had frozen chopped, not fresh sweet onion), some garlic powder, black pepper and a little salt, and sprinkled Hungarian paprika on top. Baked for 35 min. and let sit  10 min. as recipe said. it was not too runny or too dry. I will try with the Swiss cheese next time, sweet onion,and mushrooms as someone suggested. This lends itself to easy experimentation.

This is the best!! I will be making it once a week. We don’t eat bacon or sausage so I left that out and diced a large red bell pepper and about two cups fresh mushrooms. I love cheese so I added a litter more…I used yellow and white cheddars and swiss. I also cooked it about 15 minutes longer to dry it a bit more because I cut it into squares and we put it on whole wheat english muffins and had breakfast sandwiches all week!! YUM! It is quick, easy, delicious and healthy for the morning madness. Thanks for the great idea!

The BEST breakfast casserole I've ever had.  The flavor is absolutely awesome.  For the sake of simplicity I added green onions instead of a chopped white onion.  Next time I think I'll add a little white pepper for some heat.  For the last 5 mins. I sprinkled some cheddar on top and broiled for a few mins which made for a nice topping.

KEEPER....! ! !  That's what they should have named this recipe.  I made it for my bunco group one night, and they all said I should have DOUBLED the recipe !!  They were scraping the pan for 3rds...!!! I thankfully used 10 eggs instead of 6, otherwise we would have run out sooner !!! Loved having the hashbrowns mixed in, rather than sitting on the bottom which is what I've seen in other recipes. Try it, you'll love it....!!!

Made this for a free community meal at our church for Dinner!! It was so fast and wonderfully tasty! I used sausage instead of bacon because I was making such a large quantity but it still turned out tasting wonderful and it was very filling!

Sounds great as written, but I modified it based on what I had on hand.  Used defrosted hash brown cubes instead of shreds, ground breakfast sausage liberally seasoned with poultry seasoning as it was cooking, and a combination of cheddar and mexican cheese blend.  Added garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to the egg mixture.  Added a handful of cheese shreds to the top with 20 mins left to bake.  Made 1/2 recipe for my husband and I (we ate more than 1/2 of it in one breakfast!), baked in a deep round dish for about 38 mins.  Came out a little runny, so I microwaved our individual servings for about 45 seconds before serving.  Delicious - my husband really loved it - great for company - very forgiving, changeable recipe!

This is the best breakfast casserole I have ever eaten. The hash-browns absorb the egg so you don't have a runny casserole like so many breakfast casseroles are. I made to to take to a brunch/playdate. All the moms loved it and the toddlers ate it also. Everyone requested that I make it again for the next brunch.   However I did use turkey bacon, low fat cottage cheese, and I ran out of cheddar so I added some part skim colby jack also. It makes it a healthier and no one could tell. It refrigerates and reheats nicely.

Deeeelish!  I made this casserole for dinner and the BF loved it!  The only addition I made was I sauteed some green pepper with the onion, but other wise made according to the instructions.  So simple!  Reheats well in the microwave for a quick breakfast in the morning.  I don't see this recipie serving 12 however...I say more like 4-6.

This casserole is great!  It's easy to make and I can't imagine it ever coming out inedible.  I used 8 eggs, (rather than the 6 called for) which I felt was perfect.  They blended in nicely with the potatoes, and there wasn't a lot of just random fluffs of egg.  The only other suggestion I would make would to add in some salt, pepper and other spices you like.  I added just a little onion powder, seasoned salt and a dash of cayenne, but would probably add a bit more next time.  It was a little bland, but nothing that some salt and pepper couldn't fix.  Great starter recipe -- both me and hubby liked it, and we'll definitely be making it again!

This was easy and delicious.  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar because it is cheaper and monterey jack instead of swiss because my store was out.  I also added a diced pepper with the onion and some chopped zucchini and fresh herbs in with the rest of the ingredients.  And I used 8 eggs instead of 6 based on other reviews.  I definitely think it needed the veggies.  I feel like it would be all greasy cheese without them.  But with these modifications it was delicious and fairly easy to put together.  I don't have this kind of time in the morning with twin toddlers, so I made it the night before and reheated.  I froze the leftovers for another day.  Will definitely be making this again.

This is a wonderful brunch recipe.  I don't dice the bacon before cooking, but cook the strips and then crumble them into the mixture.  I've found that dicing the bacon causes it to cook too quickly; then the extra cooking time in the oven causes it to taste a bit burnt.  This is one of my daughter's favorite recipes.

Wonderful! I made several modifications out of personal taste. I made 2 half batches (cooked each in an 9x9 pan), one with chorizo sausage (a favorite of my husband's) and one with regular sausage and bacon. I used 6 eggs for each and just divided all the other ingredients between the two batches. I also used 4 oz of cream cheese per batch instead of cottage cheese. Each half took about 35-40 minutes to cook but I mostly eyeballed the time and just took them out when they looked set. It was a Father's Day hit! Will definitely make it again and again! Next time I plan to add some green pepper.

Delicious and sooo simple!! I used diced frozen potatoes because that is all I had on hand. I also put some chopped ham in along w/ the bacon. I used all Mozzarella cheese since that is what I had. Next time I might add some parmesan cheese as well. I will make this again....definately! UPDATE: The second time I did an Italian version. I used all mozzarella cheese, Bob Evans sausage and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and a small amount of fresh basil and oregano. It is to die for!!! The fresh herbs do wonders.

This is absolutely the best breakfast casserole that I have ever made.  I have made it twice, and both times it has been a huge hit.  I saw reviews that suggested more eggs, so I used 10 and it was perfect.  I wouldn't use any less.  Also, I didn't have swiss cheese on-hand, so I used mozzarella instead, and it was delicious.  Also, I would recommend using the maple sausage.  Both times I have made this, I have prepared it the night before, and just baked it in the morning... Very good recipe!

Yum!  I have made this twice and both times we have really enjoyed it.  My husband who is not a cheese fan even loved it.  I love that it requires no canned condensed soups.  You can adjust the cheeses as you wish.  The 2nd time I prepared it all the night before and pulled it out of the fridge while I was preheating the oven the next morning.  Made it even easier on a busy morning (I made for Christmas)and noticed no difference in the taste.  Will definately make again.  Great for company.

For several years, I have been searching for just the right breakfast casserole recipe for Christmas morning, and THIS IS IT.  It was the first thing gone on the breakfast table, and they liked it so well, we made it the following morning, too!!  I had to bake it a little longer than indicated - I think I had it in the oven for about 55 minutes - you can tell when it's ready (it won't jiggle in the middle).  Other than that, we followed the recipe to a T and it was wonderful!

This was phenomenal! I made this thinking I'd have breakfast covered for the weekend but we almost ate the whole thing the first morning. One of my roommates went back for fourths because it was so good! This one is definitely recommended!

Like other reviewers, I was a bit skeptical about using cottage cheese in a breakfast casserole.  Wow - loved it and so did hubby!  I made it on Christmas morning.  I think I ended up with 10 eggs in mine - I just kept adding until I felt like it looked right (not too wet and not too dry).  This, of course, made for a longer bake time - probably just over an hour for it to firm up in the middle.  Also - I cook my bacon in the oven on little racks on baking sheets; then I crumbled the strips into the mix.  All in all, it was a big hit and will definitely make again. My hubby even said that I started a new tradition with this one.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I did things a bit differently - as I had limited ingredients - but I think the recipe needs a bit of a kick - maybe some garlic and more salt and pepper.

This is our FAVORITE egg dish! However, there is no way that it takes 15 minutes to prepare! You have to grate cheese, cook bacon, chop onions, crack eggs...I 4X the recipe and don't use the swiss cheese. When you brown the onions with the bacon the onions get very dark and small. I was concerned about the look and how they'd taste in the caserole~it gives a wonderful flavor! I added 3 more eggs for every 6 the recipe called for and cut the amount of bacon in half. It is Yummy as usual!! The recipe is so flexible~you can add, take out, change things to your taste and it turns out wonderfully!! All 6 of my kids, my hubby and my live in in-laws LOVE this!! It does reheat well~if you have any left over. I think I will try making it the night before and then just popping it in the oven because of the loooong prep time! Enjoy!!

I thought that maybe I did something wrong, but after reviewing the recipe again, I know it wasn't me.  so I don't think I screwed up.  Sorry, I really don't enjoy giving awful reviews, but this was really bad.

Awesome.  I did take some suggestions by others and thoughts of my own when preparing.  Used 9 egss (didn't want to leave just 1 egg sitting in the frig door.  Used 1 pd sausage browned off real good with about a 1/4 cup of onion.  Added 1 tblsp chives and 1/4 cup half & half.  I browned the frozen O'Brien hash browns completely on both sides and put those in the bottom of the greased pan.     I let if sit over night.  Let it sit about 1/2 hour on the counter and baked for 30 minutes.  It was perfect - very yummo!

Was this ever good!  I don't do cottage cheese so the only change I made was to replace that with Ricotta.  It heated nicely as leftovers in the microwave.  A delicious recipe!

I made this the night before a camping trip, stored it in the cooler on ice overnight and popped it directly in the over the next morning. It took less time than I expected (30 mins if that?) even coming from a cool temp and turned out great. It cut very well. I used Pototoes O'brian as recommended by another user. Very simple and trustworthy recipe.

I served this for New Year's Day break-fast and it was a hit with my family.  When I re-sized the recipe for only 6 servings, it said to use just 3 eggs.  I increased this to 5 and it worked out quite well.  I also made it the day before, refrigerated it overnight and then let it sit out as the oven was heating.  I used a smaller pan, approx 7x11x2, and the casserole was less than 1 inch thick.  I might choose a smaller pan the next time I make 6 servings so that it's a little thicker.  The best part was that this was very tasty and everyone had seconds!

Made this for a bridal shower brunch... And it was a big hit! Everybody loved it :) I was kind of sketchy seeing cottage cheese as an ingredient, but to my surprise, it blended and tasted great. Even as leftovers, it was still getting rave reviews. Followed recipe to the tee with no substitutions.

Be sure to use thawed, drained hashbrowns. I used frozen this time and the consistency suffered.

This recipe is amazing!  I've made it several times and I've made several different combinations....although the original recipe is fantastic as is!  I usually end up adding 1 1/2 lbs. of meat (any combination of bacon and/or sausage) and I usually add extra cheese....but I love cheese!  I usually grate fresh potatoes instead of using frozen but I've made it both ways and it comes out great either way.  I also add a bit of salt and fresh ground pepper.  These freeze very well and I love having a pan of it sitting in the freezer in case I feel like having comfort food for breakfast or if I want to impress company without spending all morning cooking.  It always gets rave reviews!

Exellent casserole.  Just made it this morning for a Mother's Day brunch.  Followed the recipe ingredients exactly as written and didn't change a thing.  Everyone had seconds, even the grandkids!  I baked it 50 min.  Of course, once it was on our plates most of us added Franks hot sauce.  We add hot sauce to just about everything.

This was really, really good! I made it for my 92 year old mom. I'm trying to get more protein in her first thing in the morning. I used veggie sausage patties (crumbled) and cheddar/colby jack cheeses. I sampled *a few* pieces, then froze in small squares for my mom to use in the future for her breakfasts. She can just heat in the microwave. It's YUMMY!

Wonderful dish!  I used the recipe Bacon For A Crowd to prepare the dish twice now and it makes for an easier preparation.  I have served this to guests but love it to have in the fridge to heat up on those mornings you need a quick breakfast to start your day.  The recipe is great as it is written but you can toss in other veggies like chopped peppers, onion, and mushrooms.  I served with fruit and coffee cake.

Packed with flavor!! A hearty breakfast/brunch dish. I substituted the bacon for sweet sausage and broiled on low for the last 10 minutes to get the top golden brown. Delicious!!

Delicious!  This was my first breakfast casserole I've ever attempted to make.  I took others advice and cooked the bacon in strips and then crumbled and layered the hashbrowns in the bottom of the pan, increased the eggs to 10 and did not add the onion, since my family doesn't like onion.  I assembled the night before and cooked it on Christmas morning for about 50 mins.  I will make this again.

This was great! I have tried many breakfast casseroles and this is by far my families favorite. The only this I changed is I added 2 extra eggs, 1 tsp ground mustard, and pepper. I also cooked the bacon separate from the onions. I also made this with bacon and sausage. I prepared this on Christmas Eve and cooked it on Christmas morning. It did take a little longer to cook then what was stated.

Made this recipe this morning.  I have been making breakfast casseroles for the last 10 years trying to find one that my children would like - and this hit the spot.  I changed it a bit.  I used sausage instead of bacon and eliminated the Swiss cheese.  I was really good.  The onions really add a lot of flavor.  This will be our recipe for Christmas morning from now on...

Really good!  Followed several tips from reviews--cooked bacon in the microwave and crumbled when cool; cooked onion in olive oil (will use hashbrown with peppers & onions next time); used 9 eggs instead of 6; used recommended cheeses (even though I'm not a fan of swiss); mixed everything together except reserved 1 cup of the cheddar cheese to spread over the top); made the day before and cooked at 350 for about 45 minutes.  Excellent!

This is very good. I changed it by adding sausage in addition to bacon, not putting onion, and I put more cottage cheese just becasue it's the size container I had to buy. Also I added mustard powder because I saw that in another egg caserole recipe. I will make it again for my boyfriend which reminds him of his grandmother cooking. If I had to say something bad, I would say it seems like it's lacking seasonings, of course bacon and cheese tastes pretty good by itself but I added mustard powder and will probably look at other egg caseroles for ideas of other seasonings. Also, I may try the other recipe on this webiste for one that is 'healthy' but I wanted an unhealthy one today. My boyfriend at 6 servings.

We really enjoyed this, but I did not love it, so I will give it only 4 stars!  Still, it was really good and not too hard to make.  I substituted provolone for swiss, so perhaps we would have liked it better with the swiss?

Really good. I added 4 extra eggs as it seemed on the dry side. I've made it with bacon and with sausage and prefer the bacon. I layer the potatoes in the bottom of the pan and salt and pepper them before I add the egg/cheese/onion mixture. I sprinkle the bacon on the top so I can leave one end meatless for my vegetarian husband. Will not go back to the bread based egg casseroles. This is far superior. Some fruit and muffins on the side and you have an easy company breakfast/brunch.

The key to this recipe --wait for it to cool down completely when finished. The flavor was amazing in the 2nds later in the day. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious. My husband who does not like breakfast casseroles because they do all have a tendency to basically taste the same (potato, meat, cheese, eggs) even agreed :)

You cant go wrong with this dish!  I served about 5 adults, if you have more people I suggest doubling the recipe. I tried it with ham also, and it turned out fine, the bacon is the best.  I took the suggestion of frying the bacon first, for a crispier bacon, and sauteeing the onions in the bacon grease, this turned out really well.

Made this for family last weekend, the only ingredient that I added was pepper. It was excellent and filling...Plan to try in future with sausage.

This was a great tasting casserole.  I made it to take to a bible study and everyone loved it.  My only complaint and it isn't about the recipe, is that we weren't able to eat it when it was HOT out of the oven.  It had been out of the oven for about 30-40 minutes, it was still warm, but would've tasted much better hot!! I will make this again for my family and serve it right away!

Have made several different versions of a breakfast casserole.  Those with a bread base can be "iffy".  Often can be soggy.  This was great.  Family had multiple servings.  Good as leftovers, too.

Delicious! My husband won't stop asking for this dish. I will make a pan on the weekend and he will have it for breakfast (or a snack) throughout the rest of the week. I'm vegetarian, so I used Morningstar Farms sausage patties and it's fantastic! The first time we tried it, we didn't have hashbrowns, but had frozen "country potatoes". I like it with those even better, but either way is fine.

DELICIOUS!  I made one with bacon, one with sausage for a brunch last weekend thinking I would have lots left over. Both were licked clean!  Anyone know if you can mix it up the night before and put in the fridge then bake in the morning?

Great recipe! I made it for dinner with corn muffins and it was a great combo! I added an extra egg and turkey sausage just because we like more meat, as well as a bit of parmesan cheese for flavor. It was definitely cheesy. I think I will add 1 1/2c. cheddar and 1c. swiss cheese next time to make it a little lighter. It seemed pretty dense. Definitely would make for a hearty breakfast! Absolutely worth trying though, and so easy to change it to your liking!! Overall I'm very pleased!

I made this for 6 people.  We had 4 houseguests.  It was a big hit!  I used turkey bacon instead of pork and egg beaters instead of real eggs.  I didn't notice that the hash browns needed to be thawed.  I gave them a quick thaw in the microwave but ended up cooking 10 minutes longer to get the casserole done.  We had no leftovers on this one.

Wowwwweeee - I loved this dish.  This is the first time I have made a breakfast casserole and this recipe was very good.  I served 5 people and I would say it would be good up to 8 (not 12 as the recipe states).  I made the recipe as is but for two things:  1)  I cooked the bacon first, then cut it up in small pieces as someone suggested because of soggyness and 2) Baked in the oven for 55 minutes instead of 40 min.  My guests loved this dish and I will make it again - and by the way it is not greasy and the cheeses were a great combination even if it sounds weird -- cottage cheese??? Who would have thought?  :)

I made one of these with the bacon & one with sausage instead of bacon.  Both were delicious!  I did omit the shredded Swiss, mainly because it is difficult to find.  I used a shredded blend of cheeses (Mexican blend I believe) and it was delicious.  I just compensated for total amount of cheese in the recipe with the shredded blend.  My husband and I love to reheat this for leftovers too.

Very nice recipe!  I used sausage as recommended in the intro and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  I thought it turned out perfectly.  I prefer the taste of sharp cheddar, which is what I used, and I think it gave it that extra kick.  I also sprinkled a bit of extra cheddar cheese on top to give it a nice appearance.  It is very presentable to serve to guests or just do for yourself at home.  I highly recommend this dish!

Excellent! I followed the recipe except for the Swiss cheese...didn't have any. Put Mexican cheese mix instead. I thought the flavor was excellent, and I cannot tolerate bland...this was not in the least bland. Thank you for this great keeper.

Excellent.  This is definately "THE" breakfast casserole.  It went together very quickly too. It sets up nice and stayed nice and hot.
We loved it as is, but it would certainly lend itself to changing up the ingredients; such as different cheeses, sausage or ham, green onions, whatever.

This recipe is awesome!  Out of laziness we have omitted the onion on occasion and it's still just as good.  I also use low fat cheeses and non fat cottage cheese and it's still great too.

A very hearty and satisfying dish. I tweeked it a little by sub bacon for cooked bkft sausage w/onions. I also took prev sugg to add salt + black pepper (1/2 tsp each), good call on adding the seasonings as I think it helped bring the flavors together. I also added 1 tsp of dried dill weed, 1 TBSP fresh green onions (my personal choice), 1/2 tsp of salt + blk pepper at the end. It needed to cook for longer than what it called for, as it did not seemed cooked at 40 mins. I let it cook for 1 hr + 5 mins total time. Topped it w/some fresh green onions for that ahh freshness to blend w/the richness of the dish. End product was very satisfying and delicious. It's also economical if you make it to serve a lot of hungry folks, or your own sm family for several meals! I give it 4 stars for taste, next time I'll have to try it with bacon (:

This was a big hit on New Years day.  I added spinach b/c I had some to use and I thought it added nice color to the dish.  It was just as good the next day reheated.  This would serve 6 adults if served alone.

This was good, I just finished off the last of the casserole. I don't think it was spectacular as far as flavors, but it was easy to make. I forgot to buy swiss cheese so I just used an Italian cheese mix I generally have on hand. Will likely make again - in rotation with the other breakfast casseroles that I have tried.

I have to say.. my family liked this recipe but I found it to be rather boring and lacking flavor. It was however  very easy to make especially for a Christmas morning side dish. I much prefer the Cracker Barrel recipe. I won't be making this again.

I  made this for Christmas breakfast.  It was good, but since I am not a fan of swiss cheese and although I only used about 3/4 cup of swiss, it was still too overpowering.  If I make this again, I will substitute the swiss cheese with another cheese.  Other than that it was good.

Just made this for breakfast with a side of French toast, mixed berries and cinnamon rolls on this snowed in WI morning. BIG hit everyone loved it. I used cream cheese instead of the cottache cheese since I was out, worked out great. Next time I will try a sharp cheese and see how that turns out, but its definitely a keeper!

This wasn't a breakfast casserole...it was pure cheese and potatoes. Not enough egg, not enough meat, no veggies, NO spices and TOO MUCH cheese. My husband, who eats almost anything, asked me not to make this again. He said that plain 'ole scrambled eggs and bacon would have been better than this, and he wouldn't have had to wait a half hour for it.

This casserole is fantastic.  We made it without meat (there was a vegetarian in the group) and subbed  cubed potatoes instead of shredded hash.  Incredible.  Filling without being heavy.  Moist.  Perfect consistency.  It made 8 servings and was just as tasty the next morning after being re-heated.  It didn't need anything extra for flavor.  I will make this again and again!

I did not care for this as much as everyone else seemed to. I didn't use frozen hashbrowns - I used potatoes that I grated and that was the thing I did not like about this casserole. If anyone plans to use fresh potatoes instead of frozen, I would advise frying them a bit - the texture is just kind of gross in the casserole. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was great. Next time I will either try with frozen hashbrowns or cook the fresh potatoes a bit in a frying pan.

Yum!  Made this as written, but with sausage instead of bacon.  It was easy and delicious.  I think 12 servings is too high though. We had 7 and there was probably 1 serving left (and we had another casserole and fruit/muffins too).

This is a great recipe.  I add crumbled sausage as well.  I also saute my onions in butter before I add them.  Since I'm in the Southwest, I also throw in some chopped jalapenos and bell pepper with the onion to saute. (Remove the seeds from the jalapenos if you want to cut down on the heat) Spinach works well too.

I made this tonight for dinner and used Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage instead of bacon.  It was very yummy and cooked up quite nice!  The taste was excellent and it was easy.  I liked that I didn't have to break up bread as is traditional in most casseroles.  The cottage cheese added a nice touch.  I did add some garlic powder and onion powder.  I will add a touch of salt when preparing for a group.  I think you could easily serve 8 out of this dish and maybe more, if there were kids involved!  Will make this again!

Yummy in my tummy!!! I've tried so many breakfast casserole recipes....but my looking stops here.  Sooo good.  I followed the recipe, but I added green peppers and broiled it for a few min. to brown up the extra cheese on top.  With a little lousiana hot sauce on the side it can't be beat!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.....now I have to make it for my mom.  We are always competing to find the best recipes :)

This is, hands down, the best Breakfast Casserole I have ever made.  Hubs does not like the 'bready' variety (too much fluff and not enough stuff) and the french toast variety just leave him hungry.  I followed this as written and it was great - served to a brunch crowd that killed it.  I'm a salt hound so that's the only thing I would add.  Wasn't sure with all the bacon and cheese but the potatoes need a bit of salt.  A+ in my book.

My family loved this casserole!  This has become a staple in my house.  I use ham instead of bacon, added red and green peppers, salt, pepper and cumin to give it a little kick.  I've made this a few times, and it freezes really well.

I made this as my contribution for a camping weekend breakfast.  I did par-bake it to make it transportable and then finished it off in our friend's camper oven.  It was a HUGE HIT!  It did require a longer cooking time than the recipe instructed - even with the par-baking.

I guess there's a reason everyone gives this one 5! It is incredibly easy and really tasty!! I got it all ready before bed and popped it in the oven for breakfast! This is one hearty breakfast-my daughter loved it so much she wanted some after school! The only thing I did differently was reduced the bacon in half and added yellow and red pepper in same amount as the onion and cooked those together-it was marvelous! I must agree, I thought the cottage cheese was iffy, but I guess that's why we follow recipes-vielen Danke Amisher leute! Thanks for posting!

The best breakfast casserole ever! I made this the night before and popped it in the oven the next morning at 375 degrees to speed up the cooking time. I cooked the bacon and sausage, removed it and then added diced onions, garlic, and bell pepper, seasoning it with chili powder, salt and pepper. I then mixed all the ingredients (I also added pepper jack cheese, and used 7 extra large eggs). I served this at work with honey muffins and Cholula (mexican hot sauce) and everyone at work devoured it. I will definitely be making this again for an upcoming wedding brunch. Thanks.

I made two versions of this for Christmas morning.  One I made with breakfast saugsage and one with bacon.  Both were a big hit even from some picky eaters in my family.  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.

Pretty good recipe, but I felt it needed more seasonings. It seemed a little bland so as I cooked the onions and sausage I added a bit of fresh ground pepper, minced garlic, and dried oregano.   Left out the cottage cheese 'cuz I didn't have any on hand. Didn't really miss it, but it would add a creaminess that would be nice.  Reheated nicely in the microwave and the taste kept getting better and better.

This is a fantastic breakfast casserole. I'm not a big fan of the bread type casseroles, and this was just the ticket. I followed the recipe exactly besides using 7 eggs and adding a tad of salt and pepper (based on other reviews). Don't be afraid of the cottage cheese, you will never know it is there. I did broil the casserole for a few minutes when it was finished baking just to melt the cheeses evenly on top (dind't want any cottage cheese showing or my husband wouldn't eat it!). I'm making this again this weekend for a baby shower as it is so easy. Will be intersting to see if a group of gals enjoy it as much as my husband and his friend.

Made this for my Mom's Birthday breakfast and it was big hit. Was short a full pound of bacon, so added some cooked hot breakfast sausage also. As others suggested, increased eggs to 8.  Mixed everything together and refrigerated in a covered bowl the night before. Baked in the morning and it was easy and delicious.  Leftovers heated and tasted great.  My family has requested this again soon.

Super good - I made breakfast for my in-laws and they loved it. I used turkey breakfast sausage instead of bacon and got rave reviews. I was told this is a "must keep" recipe!

Very good! I have tried many breakfast casseroles with bread in it and have never really been impressed but this one impressed me! Was very worried that the amount of eggs did not seem near enough for the amounts of all the cheese and stuff, but not to worry--it turned out perfect! Used egg beaters cuz I had a lot that needed to be used up--went up to 7 eggs instead of 6, though. Used turkey bacon; was OK, but I think I might try Hot pork sausage or regular bacon next time. Used baked potatoes for it since that's what I had on hand. It cooked perfectly---those that think it's runny are probably seeing the melted cheeses. Just made it for the family this time but would be very proud to serve it at a potluck or to company! I took another reviewers advice and froze individual portions since school is about to start, it will make a quick easy breakfast for the kids (and me)!

Absolutly love, love, love this recipe! Making it as written is delicious, but adding 2c. cubed italian or french bread over the top of casserole and drizzing butter on the bread makes this dish outstanding. There's only one problem: No leftovers! My family and company always go back for seconds and thirds!!!

Served it for a baby shower brunch, it was great!  Used a combo of cheddar and colby jack cheese instead of using swiss, it was really good that way. Added mushrooms and green pepper, plus salt and pepper. Made one with bacon, one with sausage.

Absolutely delicious! But I agree with the other reviewers, needs a few more eggs. Then it would be a perfect 5-star recipe!

Simply amazing! I made this dish for my Mom on Mother's day and it was a big pleaser. It went very quickly and after my family was done with it, I was asked to make another for the party we were going to later. Even though it wasn't breakfast time the dish was eaten the fastest. The only change I made was adding about 3/4 cup of sour cream, it gave the dish a lot more flavor. Incredible dish, sure to be the new favorite!

I have been eyeing this one for awhile. I've never made a breakfast casserole as some just sound odd or really heavy. I compared this to a couple others over and over and finally decided to go for it! I experimented on a small group of family for breakfast. They loved it! I liked it because it doesn't have a ton of eggs - don't let that scare you, it was still VERY moist! I did add cayenne & dried mustard as others suggested and I think you could spice it up however you like. I did add a bit more than a pound of bacon and next time I think I'll add even more. I served this with Easy Morning Glory Muffins on this site and fresh fruit. Easy to make ahead and delicious! Thanks!!

This makes a great breakfast casserole "kit." I get all the ingredients together, pre measured, cook the bacon, before I visit friends and family for over night trips. In the morning, the ladies sip coffee while the guys throw together the "kit." I reduce the onion if there are kids joining us.

I hate to be the odd one out, but I wasn't crazy about this at all. The mixture seemed disproportionately dry, so I added more eggs. My hash browns weren't tender by the end of the baking time. I found it pretty bland, and that's AFTER I added cooked crumbled sausage; extra salt and pepper helped. I like the idea of using cottage cheese so I might play around with it, but I won't make it as-is again.

amazing dish! used turkey bacon to cut fat a little - cooked onion after cooked bacon (since turkey bacon produces less oil).  added a little milk to eggs (like 1/3 - 1/2 cup).  next time will use red bell pepper to add some color.  i had to cook it a little longer for it to set (maybe cuz of the milk? who knows?) but truly an absolutely delicious meal!

This recipe caught my eye because we live in Northern Indiana and I bet I know which Amish Inn the original poster is talking about (their food is phenomenal). Anyhow...made this for breakfast on Christmas morning and it turned out wonderfully! This is a keeper and although it is a little work it is well worth the results!

This was awesome.  Made it last night and was suprised to find I had additional kids coming to supper.  Adjusted the recipe by adding additional 2 cups hashbrowns, another 1/2 cup cottage cheese and added ham to the recipe. Left out the onion cuz I wasn't sure the teens would like it. Four out of five came back for seconds.  Heats up nice the next day as well.  Will probably increase the meat more cuz hubby likes meaty stuff.  Also I can see where the onion and adding green peppers would throw this one over the top. Out of the three breakfast casseroles I've tried from this site, this is by far my favorite.  Great!

Very good, I did make a few minor changes...I decreased the cheese a little, used sausage instead of bacon, added some green pepper with the onion and used fresh shredded potatoes instead of packaged.(shredded with food processor and rinsed until the water runs clear).  I had to cook it about an hour and a half..very good and even better the next day.

This is a delicious breakfast casserole.  Much better than the strata recipes that I've been trying over the years.  Glad I read previuous reviews about using shredded hash browns.  Followed recipe as is and we all loved it.  This is a keeper.

This casserole was very good. I did not follow the recipe exactly though. I made it with 10 eggs. Added about 3/4 cup of evaporated milk and also added a little sausage and some sauteed mushrooms. I like swiss cheese but was concerned that others wouldn't like it. The swiss wasn't even noticable. I think if I would have only put in the eggs that were suggested in the recipe it would have been very stiff. The extra eggs and evaporated milk made a nice consistency for the casserole. Will be making this recipe again.

We had this for Christmas breakfast and all really enjoyed it!  I used sausage instead of bacon and the whole bag of potatoes o'brian (country style hashbrowns with red/green peppers and onion) because the store was sold out of regular hashbrowns - reduced the onion by 1/2.  I also added an extra egg.  The peppers smelled and tasted wonderful and looked quite festive, too!  This is an awesome recipe to make ahead and refrigerate overnight.  Just bake a little while longer - maybe 10 - 15 minutes.  I served this with toasted cinnamon bread and fruit and it fed four hungry adults and two kids with a portion or two left over.

This casserole is a keeper!  This is the Christmas morning breakfast casserole I have been looking for.  Most egg and sausage casseroles are too strong for my stomach, but this was mild yet very flavorful.  My family ravaged the entire dish this morning.  Next time I will simply cook the bacon in the skillet and crumble it afterwards because the bacon was uneven - many pieces nearly burnt while others weren't crisp. Next time I might try adding a little dry mustard.

I made this with sausage because it was what I had on hand.  I also substituted the swiss cheese with shredded jack/colby blend cheese, for the same reason (it was a cold morning and I didn't want to head out to the store).  It turned out delicious and we had a hard time not eating all of it.  I hope to try the original recipe some day. :)

Tastes delicious, but beware & don't put under broiler or if you do watch very closely! Don't make the same mistake I did. It was cooking beautifully but I only had 35 min. and I was bringing this dish somewhere so I listened to some other reviewers advice and put it under the broiler, I was thinking it would quick brown the top and speed along the cooking proccess.  It was under the broiler 6 minutes after baking for 30min. at 350 and it burned the top...I was so disappointed in how it looked I didn't serve it at the potluck.  I didn't want to waste it though so I picked off the really dark parts and still ate it...it still tasted delicious.  I will defenitely make it again without rushing it! also, I did do it slightly different.  I cooked the bacon first, then sauteed the onions and lightly browned the hashbrowns with them before adding all the ingredients together and I put in two extra eggs.

This is a great recipe.  I made this for a baby shower I catered and everyone loved it.  I then made it for my family, who do not like egg in their casseroles, and they devoured it.  The only change that I made was the suggested one of using sausage instead of bacon.  The second time I made it, I used both.  This is a definite keeper.

I made this for a tailgate party before a football game and it was a huge hit. I used a pound of sausage in place of the bacon and I also added three more eggs on top of the six the recipe calls for. I'm not a huge cheese fan so I used 1 and 1/2 cup cheddar instead of two and I used 3/4 cup swiss instead of 1 and 1/4 cup. It was absolutely delish and I plan on making it again this Saturday.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and used turkey bacon instead of regular. I used an 8x8 pan and baked for 40 minutes. Frying the bacon with the onion was a nice twist, and I'll probably use that in other things now, too. My 21 month old and 4 year old loved it!

I made this breakfast casserole last night in order to test it for an upcoming ladies brunch.  I didn't make any changes, except that I used sausage and I cooked it for one hour to get it done.  My family likes it, but I think it is a little bland.  Next time, I am going to add salt and pepper, garlic, and some green pepper to liven it up a bit.  Then, I think it will be just about right!  I chose this recipe because my husband doesn't like the ones with the bread on the bottom.   And, I wanted to take something different than the usual casserole that everyone brings with the sausage, eggs, and bread.  I like the swiss cheese flavor.  It reminds me of quiche, which I love!

Thumbs up on this recipe!  We just enjoyed a delicious Christmas breakfast with this casserole.  While the kids opened their presents, the casserole baked in the over.  Not a bit of it left!  Delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!

I've used this recipe for about 6 years now and it's ALWAYS a hit.  My hubby likes me to serve it with white gravy.  It also reheats well.

This was awesome! My my children gobbled it up. As a side I sauteed a little onion, a green pepper and mushrooms to add to the top for those of use who like it (family of 7). And cut up an avocado to add to the top as well. Will be making this again and again.

This was good, but a bit bland. I added chopped red and green pepper, and next time I will add garlic and season a bit first. I will also increase the cheddar cheese to 3-4 cups and skip the swiss cheese altogether. I used 8 eggs and baked for 40 minutes.

This was really good!  I did follow some reviews and added 12 eggs.  It was so much better with more eggs.  I also used Southwest Style hashbrowns.  It has onions, green peppers and red peppers....made a big difference.

This was so easy and I loved the fact that it didn't have bread chunks or 'biscuits' in the recipe!  My picky eaters even wolfed it down!  I didn't have bacon or cottage cheese, so I used sausage and sour cream instead, and I also added some minced garlic to the meat mixture.  I will definitely be making this again, and next time I think I'm going to add some peppers & mushrooms.

Unbelievably good! Did not substitute anything. I have to admit, I'm not a big cottage cheese fan so I was a bit skeptical. No need to be, will definitely make this again!

Changes I made were: Turkey sausage instead of bacon. I substituted cheddar cheese for the swiss, and added an extra egg, and 1/2 chopped bell pepper with the onion. I also used shredded baked potatoes from the previous night. I precooked everything the night before so I could just throw it into the casserole the next morning for an easy and Delicious breakfast! My husband who adds ketchup to EVERYTHING, said he didn't even need it on this, and that is a Big compliment! :)

I love an awesome breakfast recipe.   It's easy and doesn't have to sit over night.  Made a few minor alterations.  Used cottage cheese with chives in it, and cut back on the sweet onion.  Added fresh cracked black pepper.  Super tasty, the whole family loved it (husband and 9 yr. old boy).

Very excellent. I did modify the bacon; cooking only half with the onions and the other half on a skillet that drained away the fat. I also modified the cheese; I used a colby/jack combo, then I put two cups into the casserole and about 1 c over the top. It came out just fine that way. Not greasy at all.

I made this for breakfast this morning and loved it.  I cut the recipe in half except I used 5 eggs as others had suggested.  Also, used mozzarella instead of swiss because I didn't have any and it was a last minute decision to make it.  I cut the cook time to 30 minutes because I halved it and it was perfect.  I definitely do again and I think it would be great with spicy sausage also. Yum!

I made this Christmas morning.  I thought it was pretty good, however felt that it needed more egg.  Used ingredients as listed and only added 1/2 cup green peppers with the onions.  Leftovers were good.  Will try again with maybe another egg.

Very tasty and very simple for a morning brunch or family breakfast. I used spicy sausage, hash brown cubes (couldn't find the shreeded ones) green peppers and all cheddar cheese - but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. No compaints. Enjoy!

Made this for New Years morning breakfast and it was a hit!  Also with the kids as leftovers.  It's so yummy & perfect with ham/bacon added into the mixture.  (I browned up the hashbrowns before adding them!)

Best breakfast casserole ever! I used 8 eggs, sausage, green peppers and monterey jack cheese instead of swiss.  I cut back a little on the total amount of cheese. It fed 8 people with plenty of leftovers. This is a great casserole to make ahead and have breakfast for the whole week. It reheats perfectly. I would love this anytime of the day. Great recipe!

This was excellent!  Everybody enjoyed it.  I made it with both bacon and sausage, added a little tomato and bell pepper.  Seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic powder.  My sister said it was  her most favorite breakfast.  The kids enjoyed it too.  Even the pickest one.  I served with slice bananas and a quarter orange.  Completed it all with buttermil biscuits.  Absolutely great!

This is a fabulous breakfast casserole.  I used 1 1/2 cups of swiss cheese and the whole container of cottage cheese, which equaled fewer dishes to clean up, and it was delicious. I also cooked the bacon and onion the night before so all I did when I woke up was mix everything and put in oven. My husband loved it and since it's just the two of us there was plenty left over for breakfast for several days.  I recommend it highly.

I make a breakfast casserole every Christmas.  You know what I'm talking about, your typical egg and sausage overnight casserole.  I wanted something a little different this Christmas.  This was different but not very good in my option.  I personally thought there were too many potatoes in this casserole causing it to be a little dry (I know what you're thinking, TOO MANY POTATOES??!!  WHAT??!!)  But yes, even I thought it was too much.  I don't think I will be cooking this one again.  Sorry folks.

Was very excited to try this, but was extremely dry!!!!~ I liked it very much but much of it went untouched. I guess if I tried again I would add some half and half. I cooked for well under the suggested time (but did not add any bacon or sausage -- only green onion due to vegetarian concerns). But will continue to search for some recipe that will be moist!! I happen to really like dry eggs but most people do not.

I have made this twice since Christmas eve. Both times I used sausage, and monterey jack cheese in place of swiss (because that's what I had). The 2nd time I made it I double the sausage, added 2 additional eggs, added garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper and used cubed hash browns (again, it's what I had) cooked it in a 15x10 dish.  This is a great recipe because you can adjust it to what you have on hand. I will always double the meat though. I'm giving it 5 stars because it's so versital. I'm looking forward to trying it with the swiss cheese.

Made this for our brunch on Christmas day.  I added 2 extra eggs and used Colby cheese only.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  Thanks for sharing.

This was so so for us. I made for Christmas morning as something different from our usual breakfast casserole, but there was something about the consistency that we didn't care for - personal taste. I won't make again.

This was tasty and all enjoyed.  But for me I felt like it was missing something.  A suggestion from a few people was maybe a can of diced green chiles.  Overall good breakfast dish though.

Made the recipe as written.  Very good, but think it needs a bit more seasoning.  Will try adding peppers next time.

Was skeptical of the cottage cheese added to this casserole but it was fantastic! Made it for a big Christmas brunch and everyone loved it. Followed the directions (doubled) except substituted sausage for the bacon and added S&P to the eggs. It cooked well and cut really nicely. Will be making this every year!

Made this for Christmas breakfast today!  I cooked the bacon last night, and stored all of the cold ingredients (minus the hash browns)  in a container all mixed together.  Woke up, threw it all into the 9x13 and viola!  So good!!!

Wow!  This was fabulous!  I used sausage and only used colby and jack cheese.  I also used 8 eggs and there was a little bit left over; we had six people.  Very much worth the effort to make.  I'll definitely make this again and again.  Yum!

This was a delicious hearty breakfast casserole.  It was very easy to make!  I used the basic recipe but just substituted ham for the (bacon) and added green bell peppers too!  Many raved about it!  Thanks I will be using this again and again.

Really enjoyed this recipe! Added chopped green pepper and used seasoned hash browns from the refrigerated section of the grocery store, rather than frozen. Cooking time was accurate (I'm cooking with convection, though). Put under the broiler for about 5 minutes to brown the top. Garnished with scallions. 
Yum :)

Love this casserole and always get rave reviews when I make it :)  It freezes well (or so I have heard from a family member I made it for....we have never had leftovers to freeze).  I have changed the recipe some.  I use turkey sausage crumbles instead of bacon, added three eggs to the recipe, use mozzarella in place of the swiss and don't use onion in it.  This is definitely a great meal for breakfast lunch or dinner :)

This was so delicious!  I have made many breakfast casseroles but never thought to put cottage cheese in them, and this turned out so wonderfully! Great flavor and creaminess.  Only change I made was to use Egg Beaters instead of whole eggs, and it was still fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but not wow. People ate it but nobody commented on it. I used italian sausage, added an extra egg and added green peppers. Even still, the flavor seemed to be lacking. Like I said, it was good but with all the other egg casserole recipes out there this one isn't getting saved in my recipe box.

I've changed this up a bit-- added some flavor by sauteing a bell pepper (green or red) and adding a small can of chopped green chillies. I usually use pan sausage instead of bacon, too. My family loves it.

Excellent recipe, but I don't know where I could find 12 jaded people to share it. It might serve 6 people if they weren't very hungry, and we usually plan to serve 4 with it.

I made a veggie version that turned out excellent! I used a 14 oz package of bulk soy breakfast sausage and extra vegatables. I cooked the sausage for a few minutes then added the chopped onion, cooked for a couple minutes then added a chopped green bell pepper cooked that for a couple minutes and then added about 6 chopped mushrooms and cooked it all together for a coupleminutes (this all give or take). I also added a chopped tomato to the cold ingredients. Lastly I substituted pepper Jack for Swiss, only cause I wouldn't of wanted to use the rest of it. It came out excellent and my vegaterian roomates loved it.

This is one of the best breakfast dishes I've come across. I was so tired of the old sausage/egg/bread casserole so I made this for a brunch and it was gone in no time, with many people asking for it again. This truly is "the best."

I'm not a big breakfast eater but I loved this!  And so did everyone else.  The only change I made to the recipe was I added two more eggs to make it go a little further.  It fed 5 people, a couple of which had big appetities, and there still was a little bit left over.  I would say it feeds about 6 adults.  Only one warning, if you are not a cheese lover you might want to put a little less cheese - it is quite cheesy.  However, everyone I fed it too loved the cheesiness.

This turned out just ok for me...  I knew as soon as I took the first bite I should have paid better attention to the suggestions.  The bacon was just soft and mushy...  Instead of cutting the bacon and then trying to cook it all at once I should have cooked it whole until crisp and then crumbled into the mixture.  I'll give this another whirl and see if that helps.  Otherwise it was a very yummy, hearty, cheesy, filling breakfast.  =)

I made this casserole this past week and it is now on my family's favorite breakfast list! I really wasn't to sure of it at first, because I am not a fan of cottage cheese, but after the first bite, I was hooked. The cottage cheese blends in so nicely with everything else. I am looking forward to making this one again and soon!

I used bulk sausage instead of bacon and added 2 more eggs and 1/2 cup more of potatoes. I added on a few minutes to ensure the middle of the casserole was set. Needs a fair amount of salt and pepper, even with the very flavorful sausage. We all agreed- yummy!

Awesome! This is a requested dish when I visit my kids. Left-over squares are reheated by toasting and made into a sandwich. Have made several variations, all are a hit. Used bacon and sausage together; provolone cheese; pepperjack cheese for a small kick and green peppers and mushrooms. A never-fail keeper.

We really enjoyed having a casserole without the bread and canned soup.  I used 1lb sausage instead of bacon, but will try bacon next time.  I also added about 1 tsp Cavender's seasoning.The mixture seemed a little dry before baking so be sure to NOT omit the cottage cheese.  It was not dry after baking.  This fed 4 adults and leftovers for 2 more. So I agree with previous reviews, it will not serve 12 unless it is a very small serving.

This was a winner for us. It passed the picky husband test with flying colors...he went back for seconds and then ate the leftovers for a snack later! I followed the recipe exactly. Only thing I did differently was add a few shakes of salt and pepper, and I added some green onion for color. I have honestly never eaten a breakfast casserole, so I didn't know what to expect or have anything to compare it to. I was afraid it was just going to be a glorified omelet. But the result was delicious and definitely its own dish. The potatoes and cottage cheese really make it special, in my opinion. I know some people are afraid of it being too Swiss cheese-y, but I used the listed amount and the Swiss cheese wasn't overpowering at all. It's also a very versatile dish. Next time (at my husband's request), I'm going to add diced mushroom, tomato, and sausage (our favorite omelet toppings). Simple, delicious, and satisfying!

I was very disappointed with this dish. It is way too thick and way TOO MUCH cheese. It probably could have used more eggs and less potatoes and cheese. If this is served at a bed & breakfast I can't imagine there would be many repeat customers.

This is a great recipe!  I us a couple of extra eggs, mushrooms and peppers, after it bakes allow it to cool, and cut it into strips just over an inch wide, freeze in individual freezer bags and you have the makings for a fabulous and FAST breakfast burrito.  I loved the casserole alone, but it is FABULOUS as a burrito filling.

I liked this casserole a lot and I made it exactly as written. I'm a little confused by all of the people using more eggs than the recipe calls for; I was so nervous only using 6 eggs but it turned out great and even 'eggier' than I anticipated. I would think using more eggs would turn this dish into a frittata and not a casserole. I was also hesitant about cottage cheese (who knew?) but it really turned out great.

This was AMAZING! I made it for Easter Brunch & I cannot believe the raves I received. My eggs were large but they didn't seem very large so the only change I made was to use 7 large eggs instead of 6.  I cooked it for 50 minutes as it wasn't quite set enough for me in 40 minutes. Maybe that was due to the extra egg. I must say I can't wait to make it again. FYI I have never made an breakfast casserole before. Now I'm going to expierment & come up with a lower fat version so I can have it more often. For guests I will make the original. I did make it 4 hrs. before I baked it & kept it covered with plastic wrap in the fridge. I also cooked the bacon & onuons the night before.

This dish was a hit for our Easter Brunch this year.  It was a departure from the usual tried and true one we all love.  Wanted something that was gluten free.  I used sausage instead of bacon and next time will add some dry mustard along with the salt and pepper.  Made two of these 4 days ahead.  They froze beautifully.

Made this for a special birthday breakfast for my hubby, and we loved it!  I did a few things different...I omitted the onions (yuck!), used pepper jack instead of swiss, and added a 7oz can of mild green chiles.  I also used 8 eggs as some other reviewers recommended.  Also, after I cooked the bacon I drained all but a little of the grease and sauteed the hash browns for a few minutes.  Absolutely delicious!

Only giving this three because as directed on here, it was not great. I added green peppers and sliced mushrooms, sauteed with the bacon and added 3 more eggs. Even with the extra ingredients, it was WAAAAAAAAAAAY too cheesy, and I am pretty much in love with cheese. Next time I'll decrease the amount of cheese and add even more vegetables than I did this time, definitely not a heart healthy recipe. :)

great recipe and so easy to make, even my husband could do it! a great starting point for a breakfast casserole as it can be modified to your liking with ingredients. for example, we omit the bacon and added red pepper. next time I think I might add some mushrooms as well

I couldn't find hashed brown potatoes at the grocery store I was at, so instead bought the cubed kind. Perhaps the hashed brown might be better, but the end result of this for me was just a mushy mess. I'd probably go back to using the bread type breakfast casserole.

This was good, but I think there's a little room for improvement.  The bacon did not remain crispy once baked in the casserole, which was expected but still sort of disappointing.  I can see how this would lend itself much more to chopped ham or sausage (unfortunately we are not really fans of either).  Even after the full cooking time, my hash browns were a little crunchy, and I did defrost them as per the recipe.  I think this could be great if you found the right meat, (or no meat at all), and added some fine chopped veggies to the onion saute stage, such as mushrooms, broccoli, green pepper, etc.  I subbed onion powder for the onion (as my hubs doesn't like onion), but I think a real onion would have really added something.  I will make again, but like I said, I will add lots of other chopped veggies.  All in all, good flavor, just a couple of consistency issues.  The only addition I made was some black pepper.

I suggest frying the potatoes first for texture, otherwise family enjoyed it very much.  Will definately make again.

I made a few changes to this recipe... I cooked the bacon and onions separately.  Cooking the bacon and onion together made a very greasy and almost burnt onion taste.  I cooked the bacon first the left is aside to cool while I cooked down the onions.  After the onions were cooked I chopped the bacon into little bits then added it to the rest of the recipe.  I also skipped the cottage cheese.  I don't really like cottage cheese and I really don't think this recipe needs cottage cheese.

This was not very good at all.  The only change we made to it was using sausage instead of bacon, but my daughter doesn't like bacon and I prefer it over bacon, so I don't think that change affected the overall flavor. Won't make again.

I make a breakfast vegetable casserole that we also like so i decided to incorporate the two into one. I add fresh broccoli and a diced roma tomato. I also use breakfast maple sausage.  I put the hasbrowns on the bottom, mix everything else together except the eggs and pour over the potatoes.  I add a little salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I beat the eggs in a bowl, and add 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of flour to the beaten eggs.  I then pour on top of mixture and bake 1 hour, I remove and add cheddar cheese on top and bake additional 10 mins uncovered.  We really enjoy this casserole.

This was a hit on Xmas morning ! Super easy and lends itself to substitutes beautifully. I made one according to recipe and another with cooked, crumbled sausage, cooked, sliced mushrooms and some chopped red and green peppers for a fetive twist. Both were great !

We love this recipe! I like to make this for my family for supper. Instead of bacon, I use turkey sausage and cut the cheese in half ( I chose to use colby jack). This week when I made the casserole, I added a package of frozen chopped spinach (cooked it first). It gave us a veggie with dinner and tasted delicious! This recipe is a must try!

This is a great dish! I use turkey bacon for a healthier alternative and 8 eggs instead of 6 for my family of 4 and there is always enough for leftovers the next day.

This was great!  I made this for Christmas morning for a house full of people with all different types of palates.  Everyone ate it and loved it.  It was easy to make the night before, and you should make it exactly as is the first time through - I can't think of any changes I would make (although it would be easily adaptable if you would like to make up a variation).    I agree with the reviewer who said this was surprisingly "light" - I usually don't eat big breakfasts because I crash and need to take a 3 hour nap afterward.  But I didn't experience that at all with this dish!  We loved it so much we made it again for the next day!

SOOOOO Good! Very customizable. I made it with sausage and added a can of chopped green chilies. I also used tobassco after it was done. The little ones don't like the extra heat. I do think an extra 15 minutes in the oven would help it be a little more firm in the middle. Definately do again!

This was a big hit, though I made changes (reason for 4 stars) based on my own tastes and suggestions of other reviewers:  added 1 t dry mustard, used shredded italian mix cheese instead of swiss, baked for 1 hr @ 350, added an extra egg, and I omitted onions b/c we don't like them.  This was very flavorful and will definitley make again...hubby and 3 yo son both loved it.

We made this for the first time at Christmas and it was a huge hit.  Have made it 4 times since with improving success.  We use sausage rather than bacon which might require using a little salt, but, otherwise my kids returning from college request it every time.

I thought it was great but I did add use 8 eggs instead of 6.  Texture was great, flavor was good although I added a little salt to my plate but that could have been because of the extra eggs.  I'm only giving this a 4 because only 2 of 5 kids would eat it.  I'm making it again for a back to school breakfast for our teachers this week so we'll see what they think!

I followed this exactly and found it to be bland.   I also think the hash browns made it mealy.   Just not worth making again in my opinion.  Seems like many of the positive reviewers are substituting ingredients or adding their own seasonings, which is terrific, but then that rating doesn't really reflect upon the recipe as written.

Delicious!  I baked the bacon till crisp the day before.  Did the onions in microwave with a teaspoon or so of butter for two minutes.  Used Simply Potatoes Seasoned Hash Browns from the dairy aisle and added some Fox Point Seasoning by Penzey.  Lots of compliments.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Absolutely great! You can add just about anything to it, I throw in whatever meat I happen to have on hand.  I served it for Christmas breakfast this year and my mother even went back for seconds (a huge accomplishment!).  I put in a pound of bacon and a pound of sausage, green peppers, and onions.  Did all the prep the night before so that morning I just mixed everything and it was great.

Good recipe but definitely liked it better 2nd time around with modifications to suit our taste.  Prepared this the night before using 1-lb of reduced-fat Jimmy Dean sausage.  I browned the sausage along with chopped 1/2 red onion, medium red bell pepper and 1/2 lb mushrooms.  Added 1 extra egg; used fresh shredded hashbrowns; and I omitted the Swiss cheese as I did not care for the taste.  Only used 1 16-oz package of shredded mild Cheddar /Monterey Jack Pepper cheese combo.  This was more than enough cheese IMO and definitely helped reduce the oiliness on top after baking.  Baked this New Year's day morning at 350 deg for 1-hr.

We had this for Christmas breakfast and it was moist and delicious.  It had an almost quiche-like taste and feel, but without the crust.  We're going to try it again with sausage, which I'm sure will be just as tasty!

Delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly; except that I  used chopped cooked sausage instead of bacon (Jimmy Dean's fully cooked turkey sausage from Costco).  (I was surprised the recipe didn't call for salt - but of course it got the salt from the cheese and sausage.  I also thought that the cottage cheese seemed like an odd ingredient but I dutifully added it - and it must have been a great ingredient!)   Our family really enjoyed it.  Next time I might try adding a little chopped bell pepper and mushrooms to the onion (sautee together before adding to the rest of the recipe) - would add some color and possibly even more flavor to an already great casserole!

Very good. Made two 9x13's for about 12 people. Travelled and reheated very well.  Could really experiment with different meats and veggies. Will make again for sure.

This was a great recipe! Simple and convenient. I made this Christmas Eve and popped it in the oven on Christmas day. The only thing I did different was I omitted the onion and replaced the plain hashbrown's with the frozen hashbrowns with onion and peppers already in it. Very good. Thanks for the recipe, will be making this again.

I made this yesterday for our Christmas breakfast. WOW! It was soooo good. I followed the recipe and the only thing I changed really was added more cheese and even cottage cheese...well really I didn't even measure any of the cheeses but it WAS more than asked for. Oh and the other thing I did do differently is that I made it all the night b4 (I didn't thaw the hashbrowns which I used small diced hashbrown only becuz Christmas eve they didn't have much of a selection) and threw it in the oven in the morning! It was the best breakfast casserole I have ever had! I will be making this often! Thank you for an awesome recipe!!! I used the little bit that was leftover this morning. I heated it up, buttered a crusty bun and heartedly spooned it on and made a sandwich. Another great breakfast!!!! Again thank you!!

My husband says this is one of the best breakfast he has ever had! I took the advice of cooking the bacon in strips first, then crumbling it after. I also grilled the onions in the bacon grease afterward. Makes it sooo delicious! This will be a staple in our kitchen, thanks so much!

This is a keeper- I didn't change a thing in the recipe and everyone loved it.  It isn't too eggy and not too heavy.  I fried up the bacon and shredded the cheese the night before so it only took me a few minutes in the morning to prepare.  I will make this again.  Thanks for posting!

Very good! Everyone LOVED it. I used a whole container of cottage cheese & 2 cups of swiss cheese and a whole package of shredded hashbrowns. (So i didn't have any left overs.) It turned out great.

I made this for a company breakfast and it was a hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The only modification I made was added an additional egg.  After stirring up the ingredients, I thought it was a little dry, but the extra egg made it right.  Definately will make this again.

My dad introduced me to this one Christmas and I have been hooked ever since! I did replace with a mixed frozen bad of hash browns with onions, green and red peppers and added salsa at the end. Delicious!

I made this recipe for a fund raising breakfast at my husband's office.  People clamored for it.  I made it with Apple wood bacon and added 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/2 red bell pepper (diced).  This is really such an improvement on the Egg/sausage casserole that we've grown so weary of.  This is our new Christmas morning casserole!

I made this casserole for a work party and it was excellent! Several people asked for the recipe. I substituted turkey sausage in place of the bacon and several people commented how they loved the flavor and that it was not greasy.

I made this for my son's 6th grade Holiday Breakfast.  The kids were skeptical when they saw it but after a few had tried it, the entire dish was gone in under 15 minutes.  Kids were coming back for seconds and pouting that it was gone! I thought the cottage cheese/swiss combo sounded odd but I have to say it was amazingly delicious!  Changes I made: I used breakfast sausage instead of bacon.  I sautee'd the onion in the sausage grease afterwards.  I used southern style frozen potatoes instead of hash browns.  I also threw in an extra egg.

My husband loves this casserole.  I make it twice a month for his breakfasts.  We prefer it with sausage, but have enjoyed it with bacon, too.  I always add two more eggs and a few spices.

Served this dish at a brunch that I hosted. There were only 6 of us and hardly any leftovers. Could not use bacon because of allergies to pork.  Spicey Turkey Italian sausage worked fine. This is a keeper.

Made this recipe with only minute change: I used pre-cooked bacon and cut it with kitchen scissors instead of trying to get the bacon crispy through frying. My boyfriend and his son loved it so much, I made it two weekends in a row!

I thought this was a great recipe, and would work well with sausage in place of the bacon as well.  My whole family enjoyed it.  When serving as a main dish I don't think it will serve 12 adults, maybe six, but if you have it with other things you can probably feed 12.

All of us loved this Breakfast Casserole!  I upped the recipe to 1 1/2 times and baked it in an 11x15 pan.  I also fried the hash browns for about 10 minutes with the bacon and onion (after they were done).  It turned out wonderful and is now a very favorite of the whole families and some friends.

Really great breakfast casserole, and very easy.  I have made it with both bacon and sausage.  Sausage is a little easier to make, but my bacon loving family likes the bacon better.  I have also substituted 6 cheese Italian blend for Swiss (all I had in the freezer) and it was good too.

This was delicious. Consistency was great, everyone loved it. I personally will add a little seasoning next time but it had a lot of flavor from the sausage and onion. It's going to become a fixture at my house when I have overnight guests.

We prefer this with sausage only because it is much cheaper per pound than bacon.  It's a regular in our dinner rotation at home.  My guys love brupper (breakfast for supper)!  It's a great recipe.  I am out of cottage cheese so I am subbing ricotta and we'll see how it turns out!

I made a mistake by shredding potatoes and adding them into the mix instead of the recipe's frozen hash browns. If you go this route, I suggest cooking the shredded potatoes on a large griddle with the diced onions and bacon grease. Otherwise, the potatoes don't cook evenly, and you get crunchy, undercooked potatoes.  Other than my mistake, the recipe was excellent. I prepped the casserole the night before and popped it into the oven in the morning. I took another's suggestion and broiled the casserole an additional five minutes to get a nice golden brown texture on top.

Super easy to make and sooooo tasty. I made the recipe for four servings and baked it in a round quiche pan for 25-30 min.

My familily loved it.  I too changed it a little bit, but nothing significant.  Used turkey sausage, and used 10 eggs instead of 6.

Excellent Excellent Excellent...I haven't ever had so many compliments on a brunch recipe!!  It isn't an "egg dish", so if that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere.  It IS a great tasting, filling and perfectly simple recipe for serving to your family, and doubles EASILY for a crowd.  I would make it again in a heartbeat.  I used the turkey breakfast sausage recipe from this site and didn't have a SINGLE complaint...not a spec was left.  Did I say this was excellent?

This is a favorite in my house.  I think that my husband would eat it everyday if he could!  I use turkey sausage instead of bacon and omit the onion.  Quick, easy, delicious, and filling!

Great recipe!  Left out the onion, threw in some  sauteed red pepper and green pepper, and used one 8 oz package of diced ham which was plenty. Family loved this as we needed a break from same ole cereal and yogurt every morning.

Rave reviews from all who have tried this one.  We make it with ham as it's easier to buy diced ham than make bacon....very yummy

Absolutely outstanding!  Because we don't like cottage cheese, we just used more of the cheddar and swiss and it was still excellent.  I recommend making extra because a single serving isn't enough; everyone wanted seconds.  I wrapped the leftovers in individual serving sizes and froze them.  It warmed up great.

I have made this twice now- once with meat (I used a half pound each of  turkey bacon and turkey sausage) and once without. Both times it was really delcious and savory. I love the swiss cheese flavor. Next time I'll try adding some green pepper and mushrooms.  Very rich and filling.

I made this for company, family brunches, and tennis friends.  It is always a hit.  There are never any leftovers.  I like to substitute the Southwestern Hash Browns for more zip.

This dish received 8 thumbs up from the 4 of us at the supper table tonight. I made it using breakfast sausage and added sweet green and red peppers along with the onions for additional color.  Will make again - for supper or breakfast!

I've made this several times and it's turned out great every time. I use a pound of sausage instead of bacon and I think it's great that way. I also use less Swiss and more cheddar (or Gruyere instead of Swiss--super yum) and it still comes out super tasty. I also usually use a couple more eggs than the recipe calls for, just because I like eggs, but with more eggs or the amount the recipe states, it still tastes great. I did find that I needed to leave it in the oven a while longer at higher elevations. Also I find that this doesn't quite set as well in a gas oven vs. an electric oven, even if cooked a little longer.

Fantastic.  Easily customizable for your tastes.  I used 8 eggs and added chopped green pepper and sliced mushrooms - husband RAVED.  Had it for dinner and then reheated the next morning for breakfast!  Delicious and so creamy.

We call this 'hangover casserole' at our house. Whenever we have overnight guests this is my go to dish. I omit the bacon and have subbed mushrooms and asparagus. Yum!

I found this recipe when looking for a Breakfast Casserole recipe to make for our church's monthly Sunday School Breakfast.  I read the reviews and I even doubled the recipe because I read where one person said that it was big enough to serve 4 people,  WOW that must have be 4 growing teenagers .  When the recipe was doubled it made 2 large casseroles.  Since I doubled, I added a lb of bacon and a lb of sausage, and subed the swiss for mozzerella,   It has delicous!!!!  And it did not last long at church either, it looked the most appealing among other breakfast casseroles, and most who tried it went back for senconds.  I now make the original recipe for my own family, still subbing with mozz chesse.  and I use 1/2 lb sausage & 1/2 lb bacon!  Love it! Thank you very much!

I  assembled this the night before and stored in the refrigerator overnight.   I used sausage instead of bacon and used a total of 9 eggs.  It was a big hit with my adult Sunday School class.

I doubled this recipe and it was barely enough for 11 people. The cottage cheese really adds to it. I cooked the bacon and crumbled it, then cooked the onion in the reserved bacon grease. Next time I might add more veggies - bell peppers and broccoli would be good I think. Definitely easy and people loved it!

I made this for our Mother's Day Brunch and I was announced TOP chef.  It was DELICIOUS!!  I ended up adding 12 eggs.  I precooked the bacon and after it cooled off I cut it up.  Next time I think I will brown the has browns before adding to mixture (I used frozen hash browns and let them thaw out for about 20 minutes).  Omitted the onion and swiss due to picky eaters.  Added extra sharp cheddar cheese, this was to die for.  My husband refused to let anyone take home some leftovers and has requested that this be put on his top 10 favorite list.

I loved this recipe!  Thankfully, I read the reviews and followed the suggestions.  I used 10 eggs instead of 6.  I baked it for 50 minutes.  I used crisped bacon but found it wasn't crispy once in casserole.  I will use sausage next time.  Otherwise everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!

This recipe is fabulous! I have been looking for a good breakfast casserole recipe that is gluten free and this is it. I made a mistake in the preparation that actually turned out well - I forgot to cook the onion with the bacon and just threw it in with the grated cheese before I realized what I had done. I just baked it with the raw onion and it gave it a really great flavor. I would do it that way again but would probably cut the onion amount just a bit. I made a double batch for eight people and there was only a small amount left. A single batch will definitely not serve twelve. I had to cook it about 15 mins. longer than your suggested time of 35 to 40 mins. as I had it in the oven with a ham. Also, I put it under the broiler for a minute or two before I took it out of the oven. Looked and tasted great!

I've made this twice, to rave reviews.  Tried it with all low fat/fat free cheeses, still wonderful.  It looks like a huge amount but my table of 6 people devoured the whole pan in one sitting.

Yum, yum. I loved this dish. It was much better after sitting in the fridge over night and I ate it the next morning with a few sprinkles of feta cheese on top and some ketchup. YUMMY will make again.

WAY lacked salt, pepper, & something else. I'm thinking a touch of cayenne (not to be spicy...just a little "something"). Plus, by the time you make the bacon crispy, the onions are scorched. Next time I will start the bacon on it's own and add onion when the bacon is close to done. I will make it (with more flavor) and review again.

Made this today, I was easy to make but I was not impressed with the taste..Loaded it up with some salt and pepper and that helped some...I think maybe it was the Swiss cheese that none of us liked...overall not bad, but I think next time I will just do all cheddar cheese.

WAY better than the casseroles with all the bread in them.  This was full of flavor.  I needed to feed a few extra people so I was generous with the cottage cheese and added 2 extra eggs.   I also used part turkey bacon, part ham and tossed in a small can of green chilis.  Delicious!

This casserole is excellent. I have made it twice now. Both times I prepared it the night before and kept it in the refrigerator. Then, the next morning I put the casserole in a cold oven and cooked for a total of 45 minutes.  I made it once with bacon and shredded potatoes, and then another time with cubed ham and diced potatoes. Our favorite combination is shredded potatoes with ham.  Even my 3-year old loved it!

This was wonderful. I added sliced mushrooms, halved grape tomatoes, and 3 extra eggs. Next time I will also add green pepper and brown the hash browns a little before mixing everything together. There was quite a bit of moisture right out of the oven but it was perfect when we reheated it the next day. The moisture could have been from my extra vegetables. This recipe is a keeper.

YUMM!!!  This is SO good!  I was hesitant, as I do NOT like cottage cheese and stay away from anything with it in it.  After this bakes up, you cannot even tell there's cottage chesse in it!  It is SOOOO good!  I've made it a few times now and am making it again tonight to put in the freezer for the babysitter while we're gone next week!

I just got a text message from my step daughter asking if I remember the breakfast casserole I made at christmas.  LOL  Of course it was this one.  She being a very picky eater, asked me to make this again this saturday.  I love this recipe and it is so easy.  The only thing different was that I put it all together the night before and stuck it in the fridge. then before opening presents put it in a "cold oven" during the pre heat and by the time we were done it was done.  Outstanding recipe.

This turned out really delicious. I put it all together the night before, and then baked it the next morning for an hour at 350. I used the sausage rather than the bacon, and cooked it in the onion. I got the frozen Ore Ida hashbrown potatoes, and let them thaw(for the most part) in the fridge. I used  Cheddar and Jack cheeses, no swiss. I did use the cottage cheese. Also, I used 10 eggs, instead of the 6 the recipe called for. So glad I added the extra egg-it needed it! Brought it to my grandparents house for breakfast the next morning, right from the oven! Yum!

This is a great way to start the morning!  No changes needed.  I made one batch with sausage and one with bacon - the bacon is better.  If you're a bacon lover, you could use 2 lbs of bacon & it'd be even better.

This was a delicious Christmas Day breakfast. I did make one change I fried the hashbrowns with dehydrated onions and seasoned salt and pepper before I combined them with the rest of the ingredients. Hashbrowns tend to be a little bland to me otherwise.

very good. great if you can't make the night before.  Didn't know if the potatoes should have been cooked first.  Hash browns were a little soggy.  Would make again.

[Edit- 3/1/10-  Tried this recipe today with ham, broccoli, and green peppers- the best yet!]




I'm not much into breakfast food, but when a family friend passed away unexpectedly, I wanted to send more than just a spaghetti dish or something. I thought a nice breakfast casserole would be a nice, protein-filled morning dish for the family instead of a dinner dish or a cereal-or doughnut breakfast. The family absolutely loved it, and I've made it for my parents/family every once in a while even though I don't eat it. It's a huge hit every time and easy to make. I usually do half sausage and half bacon, and add green peppers and broccoli, and offer sour cream to top it with. Thank you so much for this recipe, and my family thanks you too!

I followed this recipe almost exactly except I added diced green pepper.  It was good, but I just have to say it wasn't worth the calories.  Something this fatty really should taste a whole lot better.

Really good! Will definately make again. I cut down on the bacon and added cubed ham - also used 2% cheddar - I mixed everything the night before, refridgerated it, and cooked it the next morning. It did need a longer cooking time, probably closer to 55 minutes.

After reading the reviews I used a dozen eggs.  I used pepperjack, colby jack, and sharp cheddar cheeses.  I also opted for 1 lb of Jimmy Dean hot sausage and 1/2 lb of crumbled bacon.  I browned the hashbrowns with some green pepper and loads of spices.  I cooked in a 9x13 for about 50 minutes.  This was very good and very filling!

I really enjoyed this, I did take the advice of some others and broil the top of the casserole. I made this for my mother-in-law who is from California and she enjoyed it said she had never had anything like this. I might try sausage next, especially the apple sausage that come during the fall season. I will be making this again to take camping this fall. I plan on pre making it and heat and eat while there.

Fabulous! I substituted chopped broccoli and fresh mushrooms for the bacon, added spices (garlic and chili powder) and reduced the cheese slightly. Got an A+ from the whole house, omnivores, vegetarians, kids and adults. Will be my go-to recipe for breakfast casseroles. ~nyx

Really tasty and rich. Made for just our family of 4 but should save this for company because a little goes a long way!  Used 8 eggs.  Used southwest potatoes.  Perfect easy breakfast casserole I've been looking for.

This was WONDERFUL! I made one with sausage, one with bacon.  Both were equally popular with our company (though I preferred the sausage).  I used a bag of the Ore-Ida "Country Inn Creations Peppers & Onion" hashbrowns in place of the plain hashbrowns.  I also used an extra 1/4 cup of shredded Swiss cheese, since the package I bought was 1.5 cups and it was just easier to use it all.  I was suspicious that the recipe didn't call for any seasoning, and I thought it might at least need some pepper added at the table, but I was pleased to discover it didn't need anything! You could easily add some seasoning (or use seasoned hash browns) to change the flavor if you wanted, but it's certainly not necessary!

This is truly a versatile casserole: use any combination of cheeses you like (Swiss/Cheddar is awesome, but I also like Pepper Jack/Cheddar), add a finely diced bell pepper, sub sausage for bacon. I only had 2 cups of shredded potatoes and 3/4 cup cottage cheese the other night and it still turned out great! This dish is always hit, whether for breakfast, brunch, of breakfast-for-dinner.

Although this only fed 6 of us, it was delicious!  I served it with blackberry waffles, fruit salad, muffins and sausage patties for brunch.  Everyone wanted the recipe. I recomend this to anyone who wants a hearty meal...  Had there been any left, I would have eaten the leftovers for dinner.  I will absolutely make this again!!!

I made this recipe for my mom on Mother's Day.  It was great!  Even my dad liked it and he normally isn't the biggest fan of casseroles.  I will definitely make this again.

WOW! Great recipe. Would follow some prior tips and cook bacon first and then add onion. I also did a mixture of bacon and pork sausage and it was a hit as I made it for 16 people this morning.

this was a really good casserole.  i made it for dinner and everyone ate it.  and everyone came back for seconds and thirds.  it is really tasty.  kind of on the fatty side though, but really good, homey and warm.

I usually don't like casserole's but this one is WONDERFUL!  I served at a brunch and everyone loved it.  I changed it up a little.  I did not use onion, instead I used the hash browns with the peppers and onions mixed in already!  I cut down on the swiss and used more cheddar (half mild and half sharp).  YUMMMM

I found that there were too many hash browns in this recipe and not enough eggs.  It wasn't bad, but not one I'd make again.

I made this with sausage rather then bacon and it was fantastic. I made only one minor change...I sprinkled crushed red pepper flakes over the top before baking to give it a bit more "zing"! Even my son who refuses to eat leftovers had this for breakfast the day AFTER I made it! Very good recipe.

I made this dish for Christmas breakfast. My very picky son in law ate half the casserole. I loved it as well and made it for a pot luck at work and everyone said I should have doubled the recipe so they could have had more. I will make this agian. I followed the recipe exactly but thought next time I might try some green pepper in it.

Great recipe.  I cooked the bacon and onion together and put it in the fridge overnight so that I could quickly mix everything together and bake on Christmas morning.  Next time I try this I will add more eggs, as the recipe is pretty rich.  Also, don't wait for the bacon to get crispy with the onion - almost impossible cooking it that way.  Next time I may try to cook the bacon first and then cook the onion in the bacon "juice".

i made this for my husbands b-day breakfast and i think it made his day.  
the only thing i changed was that i added mushrooms (hubby is a mushroom fanatic) and some cut up breakfast sausage links.  I know it was super fatty, but it was his b-day treat.  and boy, was it good.  we will make this again.  mmmmmm.... bacon

I made this on Christmas Eve for the next morning.  It was wonderful!  Our family has brunch on Christmas after we open our gifts.  It was nice not having to cook, just pop it in the oven.  I added 3 more eggs after reading other remarks.  We love swiss cheese and I would not change anything else.  It was so good and easy to put together.  Thank you for a recipe I will make again!

I made this for Christmas brunch and we ate almost every bite. Even the kids loved it and all the adults had seconds. It is a great recipe for those who are not fond of sausage, which is in almost every breakfast casserole. I will make this again and again! It would make a great potluck recipe too or something to take for a family who has had a new baby. Lots of people bring dinners, but it is nice to have something to pull out and heat up for breakfast that is already prepared.

My mom made this for Christmas morning and it was a big hit. My husband is in love with it. I personally thought there was too much pepper (maybe from the sausage), but one speck of pepper is too much for me. Great recipe...

VEGETARIAN VERSION: I used Morning Star fake bacon instead of real bacon because we're vegetarian (20 slices total). Turns out great. Next time, I might cut back a wee bit on the bacon & add an extra egg or two because it was very baconish the way I made it (I think the fact that veggie bacon is flavored artificially means that its flavoring permeates everything more completely or something). Great leftover too...

I am guilty of changing the recipe and really don't like it when others do that!! I used ham which worked just fine. I thought the flavors were great but I made a few mistakes.  I used cubed frozen hash browns and I think that made this not as good.  It seemed a little "lumpy."  I also tried to make it more healthy ( what was I thinking???) by using fat free cottage cheese. It made it a bit watery. Next time I will try and find the shredded potatoes and use regular ingredients. Live and learn!!

My entire family said this was the best breakfast casserole I have ever made.  I liked that it wasn't so heavy with bread or peppers.  I am not a fan of the texture of cottage cheese, so I whipped it in the food processor before adding to the eggs.  I made this the night before so in the morning, I left it out for 1/2 hour (while the oven was heating) and baked it for 35 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It will be our Christmas morning casserole from now on!

This was very well received by my family on Christmas morning.  I have a family member with special dietary needs so I used ham, egg beaters (12 eggs), low fat cheese, and fat free cottage cheese (2 cups).  You would never know that I substituted low fat ingredients.  I did follow some other suggestions about spices and added ground mustard, herbes de provence, hot sauce, and diced green pepper (added with onions and ham).  I prepared the casserole the night before and baked it in the morning.  It was delicious and I will definitely make again.

Great recipe.  To save time and clean-up I used one bag of Hormel real bacon bits and dried minced onion.  It tasted great and was quicker to make and easier to clean up.  It is also good with frozen diced potatoes as opposed to shredded.

The only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is it's health value!! I have baked many breakfast / egg casseroles but this one may now be my favorite. I made it for a brunch I hosted for several women and they all raved about it. One of the women was a former Amish! I did add one more egg, about 1/4 C. more cottage cheese and also did the bacon in the microwave, separate from the onions. Great!!

This breakfast casserole is very easy to assemble and tastes delicious.  I have substituted sausage and ham and they both are good as the bacon.

I made this a long while ago and never rated it.  It was good the way it is, but I agree with those who said it was little bland.  Perhaps with some seasonings, this would have been a four or five star!  Or possibly just changing the bacon to seasoned sausage of whatever kind you like.  It was good, but definitely could use a few seasonings for taste.  :)

Not a hit in my house this morning. Maybe it's because I tweaked the recipe based on what other reviewers wrote and the ingredients I had on hand. I used refrigerated hash browns, put on the bottom of pan and baked for 7 minutes. Didn't have enough cottage cheese, so added more swiss cheese.  Didn't look like enough egg, so added 3 more eggs.  It was rather bland and the swiss was overpowering.  If I try this again, I'll make it exactly as written and see if that's better.

I had 22 relatives for breakfast last weekend and this was a hit! My family,who is not fond of eggbakes loved this. I made it with O'Brien style hash browns and coarsley ground ham. I chose the ham for prep simplicity. We wouldn't change a thing. Thankyou, I will definitely make this again.

I am not into breakfast casseroles because they always are filled with bread.  This one was delicious.  I diced up the bacon, fried it crisp, then removed it to drain. Then I added diced onions to bacon fat to cook and removed and drained.  Had everything prepped the night before and just mixed it all the next morning.  The swiss cheese really made it to me.  Almost like a quiche.  I can't believe I am rating a breakfast casserole. It is really good.  Hot sauce is good with this!

Nice breakfast. Didn't fry bacon(Gwaltney's low fat pork bacon)and baked strips it on rack over baking sheet lined with foil. Crispier bacon & less grease.

We used the processed swiss cheese slices and added both bacon and sausage. It was the best casserole ever at our Christmas brunch.

Easy and delicious!  Not a crumb left. Served it on Xmas eve morning and it is going to become our holiday tradition.  The only change I made was to 
season the hashbrowns with salt and pepper.

The egg mix was flavorful but nothing special.  Unfortunately, the potato base was boring and bland.  I don't think I could recommend this recipe.

I liked this much better than other breakfast casseroles that have egg-soaked bread. However, I did have to make some changes. I increased the number of eggs to 10 and decreased the amount of potatoes. I also used Mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss because that was what I had. Next time that I make it, I will add green pepper and a few spices. Otherwise, I thought it was delicious. My 14 year old daughter requested leftovers for lunch (and dinner!).

I have been using this recipe for about 7 years now. At that time my my kids and hubby loved it! It has now become a requested dish at family gatherings. It is so versatile, you can make it with whatever you have on hand. I have made it with sausage, bacon (my fave), ham, and no meat at all for my newly vegetarian daughter. It's always delicious. At times I've substituted mashed up thawed tater tots if I didn't have hash-browns. I've also made it without the cottage cheese, which is still tasty but better with it. The recipe is pretty good as is. I just always cook my meat first and onion then add it to the rest. I've even recently started making this in muffin pans so we can pull it out during the week for a quick hearty breakfast. My teenagers love it and my mother in law asks me to make it for her church gatherings! Two picky groups of people, lol. It's super easy, cheap ingredients and delicious!

Very good recipe! My entire family loved it. I only made two changes - used sausage instead of bacon and added 4 additional eggs. 6 eggs really isn't enough to balance the rest of the ingredients. Will definitely make again!

This is pretty good but I dont; see anything spectacular about it. I added 6 eggs to make it a dozen and that worked well. Used all cheeses as listed even tho I was scared of the cottage cheese but that also worked fine. Also, overbaked it by almost 1/2 hour but it was not a bad thing at all. I would add some veggies next time for some additional flavor altho that's prob not stricly Amish then. Basically, good and easy.

I love this casserole!  I make it all the time for my husband and I.  The most time consuming thing about it is cooking the bacon.  I love the fact that I can make it at night and bake it in the morning.  I brought it to a work brunch one time and everyone asked me for the recipe.  We substitute regular bacon for turkey bacon to try to make it a little healthier and its still so yummy! I love it!

I really liked this casserole, I was anxious to find one that didn't have bread and/or sausage gravy in it.  Like some other posters suggested, I used extra eggs and I used turkey sausage rather than pork to lessen the calories a bit.

I have made this recipe numerous time and I still feel this is the best breakfast cassserole. I think the cottage cheese is the key to this recipe.   I do make just a couple chages though. Instead of Bacon, I add sausage and chucks  of ham...and I don't add the swiss cheese. I just use the cheddar.  Everyone loves this recipe.   Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Very good casserole. Made excactly as written except for one small change. My bacon was frozen and I was tired, didnt feel like defrosting and cooking it so I used real bacon bits instead, so glad I did. And made it that much simpler to make. Don't add more eggs as other have sugested. I baked it for 1 hour and it set perfect and was golden brown on top. This is a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly except made it the night before and took it out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. I baked it for 50 minutes and everything was done except the potatoes were a little hard. I used frozen potatoes and they were completely thawed. They might have been better if I baked it a little longer. The dish was delicious though!

I made this for my family this weekend and got rave reviews. I refrigerated overnight and popped in the oven in the morning. The only thing I changed was I added 1 chopped red pepper. Next time I might try a ham and mushroom variation of this recipe. You can really throw in whatever you want. Already passed this recipe on to my family & will definitely make again!

Delicious! But, I was a bit nervous when first making it.  My bag of hash browns said NOT to thaw, and never have made them so I did not thaw them.  So, it was very dry when it went in the oven.  End result was fine, no problems and so good!  I did use sausage instead of the bacon.  This was by far my family's most favorite breakfast bake so far and don't think that we will look any further.  Thank you for sharing!

Big hit with kids and adults. I did an easter test run on my kids preschool class at the school brunch. 
I used sausage instead of bacon and added some milk. The cottage cheese freaked me out but no one would ever know it was there. 
Very Pleased.

Made this for a breakfast for dinner party!  I made two casseroles, and they were a huge hit!  Not a crumb left!!!  I used sausage instead of bacon, but cooked the onions in bacon fat.  I also used Potatoes O'Brien, because I couldn't find shredded potatoes.

This is a great recipe! To cut down on fat, I used Canadian Bacon. I also used southern style potatoes and added 2 extra eggs.

This is a really great breakfast casserole! I made it exactly, with the one exception I didn't have shredded hashbrowns, but the country style instead. It was really, really good. It was a little bit bland, but nothing a little salt and pepper didn't fix after serving.

I have also made this with breakfast sausage, and that also is delicious. The next time I make it, I'm going to use Potatoes O'Brien, I think that'll be just the touch to put this over the top.

I made this for a brunch potluck at work and it was a major hit with everyone.  It was the first breakfast casserole to be eatten.  I made it with a 1lb sausage but I am sure it would be just as great with bacon.

Didn't have bacon so I substituted 1# of sausage cooked with the onion.  I used a full doz eggs and a 32 oz pkg of shredded hash browns.  I increased the cottage cheese to two cups, but used the original measurements for the other cheeses.  Delish & filling!

Everyone enjoyed this casserole.  I followed some of the other's advice and cut the bacon first.  I found it took a long time to get crispy that way though, atleast for me.  Next time maybe I will cook the bacon ahead of time to give it time to cool before crumbling.  I also put the hashbrowns in the bottom first then put the mixture on top.  I think I may actually prefer it mixed in though, as the recipe states.  I only gave it 4 stars b/c I would like a bit more flavor.  Perhaps some peppers added would do that.  Otherwise a good easy and relatively quick recipe.

Love this!  I used fat free cottage cheese and low fat cheddar to try and feel a bit better while eating it.  I added green peppers and green onions for a big of color.  I also used 9 eggs (to try and use up a carton.)  I'm going to try freezing it in breakfast sized portions for those quick mornings.

I made this for a group of teenagers who stayed the night following a dance.  We all loved it.  This is my new breakfast casserole for all gatherings.  I made it with the following changes:  added sweet peppers (next time I think I will add jalapeños as we like spicy).  Also, I used the frozen country style hash browns and a package measured 5 cups instead of 4 so I added one more egg.  Wasn't sure how it would come out, but it was perfect.  Thank you for a perfect recipe, my family loves it.

This was awesome, even though I do not like cottage cheese. I made as suggested, though I did cook the onions and bacon separately - easier to crumble the bacon after cooking. Very filling, but if there are more than 4 or 5 people to feed strongly suggest making two batches.

Just follow the recipe, don't even be tempted to add salt and pepper, it's perfect the way it is. The only change you'll need to make is to double the recipe, it tends to disappear!

Good hearty homey breakfast!  I elected to use ham in lieu of bacon because I'm lazy and also added some diced green and red peppers to add some veg.  I mixed everything and tossed it in (TWO) 9X13 pans the night before for an even easier breakfast in the morning.  This will be a company breakfast staple at the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, Beth Notaro!

This is the best breakfast casserole I have ever had! I did change some things because I needed to make it with what I had on hand. I used fiesta cheese blend and added green pepper to the onions. My mom has company a lot and I'm about to send the recipe to her. YUM!!!

I made this for Christmas breakfast for my in-laws. I wasn't asked to bring anything, so I showed up with a surprise. Let me tell you how my husband was DROOLING while it was baking, it smelled so good! He requested half bacon, half breakfast sausage, so I made it that way. I omitted onions just because there are too many onion-haters in the family. Also, when I went to purchase frozen hash browns, they were GONE! So I crumbled up some hash brown patties instead. Worked great!
My Uncles-in-law both loved it, and commented again and again (to themselves) how great it was, which to me, is the biggest compliment there is. :n) (an overheard one!) Loved it, will make it again!

This is an amazing breakfast casserole recipe and will be my go-to Christmas morning breakfast from now on.  Great if you are feeding those with gluten intolerance (just make sure the hashbrowns don't have gluten and you are good to go).  I add Franks Red Hot and additional peppers to the mix.  This is a 5 star recipe that I will be keeping around years to come.

Wow! this is sooo good! I have tried breakfast casseroles in the past but could not find the flavor and texture I was seeking, this is just awesome! Thank you for sharing. We had it Christmas morning and I used left over ham in place of the bacon and made it New Years morning.

Needs more egg, and I used Sausage instead of bacon. Didn't have swiss so used mozzarella in place of the swiss. Was good but I'd put more egg in it if I make it again.

Wow this is such a good recipe!!!!! I make it on Christmas morning every year and my hubby can't wait to dig in. The first thing he usually ask is when are u making breakfast lol. It's great as let overs. Per my taste I use all cheddar cheese no Swiss and I always use breafast sausage instead of bacon and I leave out the onion due to food allergy and it still is soooooo yummy I would give this 10 stars if I could!

i tried lots of others before this one because I didn't think the guys would like one with cottage cheese. It's everyone's favorite.  Just as written, it comes out consistently wonderful.  Great with salsa.

Great for a crowd, and everyone loves it!  I make it vegetarian, by replacing the bacon with Gimme Lean meatless sausage.

I modified this a bit because I didn't have several things on hand. I used sandwich honey ham diced instead of bacon, potatoes o'brien instead of hash browns and onions, 5 eggs because I was out, 1 1/2 cups sour cream instead of cottage cheese (which I regret. I know the cottage cheese will be much healthier) , and 3/4 c cream cheese instead of swiss.  I added a can of rinsed and drained black beans too. It was good this way--I am certain because of the results that it when I cook it as written, it will be very very good (and healthier than my version), but I will still add black beans.

This is excellent. I did use a pound of pork sausage instead of bacon (simply because that's what was in the freezer). Baking time was increased to 50 minutes, because it wasn't set at 40 minutes. It has great flavor and my 3 year old really liked it. We had it for dinner tonight and I am looking forward to leftovers. A great recipe that I will definitely make again, and I will try bacon next time.

This was the best breakfast casserole I have ever made, most lack flavor, but not this one.  I took it to a family brunch and it was the first thing gone.  I did substitute sausage for the bacon (not much of a bacon fan) also added red pepper because  I happened to have some on had.  Turned out wonderful.

Haha! My kids NEVER even suspected there was cottage cheese in this recipe! I skipped the bacon and put in sausage then also skipped the swiss cheese and went all cheddar.  It was yummy! I might cook the hash browns first next time though.

Ive made this several times for my family and never have any leftovers. My one year old nephew couldnt stop eating it the last time i made it. The changes i made were i used 9 eggs and some garlic salt some fresh herbs and used yellow onion since that is what I usually have in the fridge. And I also use whatever cheese i have. I eat mine with jalapenos. YUM

Excellent! It isn't as fluffy as other casseroles, but it also doesn't have to sit overnight. I used bacon, which was very good. I'm excited to try sausage, or even ham. I also might add some green chilis next time as well. I will definitely make this again (and again).

I made this in my dutch oven at a demo showing all the things you can do in your ovens outside with only coals.  This was a hit!  I took the lid off and people grobbed it up within 5 min.  I was able to get just a bit.  
I followed the direction with only on change I used sausage in place of the bacon as that is what I had.  
Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this dish was amazing!! My family enjoyed it quite a bit. We did not change anything about the recipe except the onion part. We used the dried onion instead of fresh onion. I already have it on my menu to make again! Thank you. When we move to North Dakota this will be an awesome cold Saturday morning breakfast to warm us up!

Good, but salty. Don't add the salt. I liked making it ahead and freezing it so I could pull it out for Mother's Day. I want to try it with sausage next time.

This dish was amazing. I've made it three times, once with bacon, once with sausage and once with ham. The sausage was a bit much for me, I would suggest the ham or bacon. Super easy and good for holiday meals though!

Love this recipe! The cottage cheese makes it! I've done this with bacon or sausage and I particularly like to use tater tots instead of hash browns. It has more texture but even with hash browns, it's a great recipe and the only one I make now.

This casserole is very easy and very good.  I have made it twice and the second time I added a red bell pepper, which was a nice touch.  When I make this again I will definitely brown the hashbrowns before putting them in the casserole, as other reviewers have suggested.

This is the best breakfast casserole.  I have made it with bacon and sausage for a baby shower brunch and they are both very good.  I prefer bacon and the last time I made it I didn't want the mess of frying bacon so I bought already cooked bacon and will do that from now on.  Bacon taste without the mess.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  It is so good and very easy to throw together.  I actually made this for our families Super Bowl Party and it was a huge hit.  I think my husband went back for 2nds, 3rds and maybe even 4ths.  My kids loved it. too, even my very picky 15 yr old son!

This is great!  Thanks we change it up and add veggies and Italian sausage sometimes, but it is wonderful as written.  I love that there is no "wet bread" texture!

Made this as written on Christmas morning, and was very delighted with the results.  I am making it again, this time with turkey sausage, just to try to cut out some of the fat.  Exceptional recipe as written, and can be tweaked for your family's preferences.

Tried this recipe with some Turkey bacon and cheeses that I had on hand.   I put it under the broiler for 2 minutes and let the top really crunch up.  Loved it! The family couldn't get enough.  Next time, will try it with some veggies mixed in.  I think it will taste great like that, as well.

I followed the recipe except I used sausage instead of bacon.  The outer edges were cooked, but very runny in the middle.  I will try this recipe again, since it was very good.  If any one has any suggestions as to why the middle of the pan was not cooked, please let me know.

This was AWESOME!  I didn't use the cottage cheese, added 2 more egs, and about a cup of chopped ham.  I made this for my mom, brother, boyfriend and our kids.  They devoured it and loved it!  I served buttered French bread with it.  I will definitely make this again!

I substituted sausage and ham for the bacon, added fresh mushrooms and sprinkled bread crumbs on the top prior to baking. It was excellent and I will definitely make it again.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it turned out great! I followed the recipe as written, however, it is a nice basic recipe that seems easy to modify. I completely assembled it the day before so all I did that morning was put it in the oven.

Fantastic!  I wondered how the cottage cheese would work out... but it gives it a very good creamy texture.  I used what ingredients I had, so I did: a.  breakfast sausage b.  fresh shredded potatoes (dried with paper towels) c.  cheddar/jack cheese blend (2 cups total)  One thing I want to try in the future adding is green chilies, because I love them with egg dishes.  A great way to eat this lefover is with a sunnyside-up egg on top!

The best breakfast casserole I've made so far! The first time I made it, I didn't have enough bacon so I used Canadian bacon. It was just as delicious and much healthier. Do not be leery about the cottage cheese, even if you don't like cottage cheese. It just adds a nice texture and enhances the flavor of the other cheeses.

I made this for Christmas brunch & everyone loved it! I prepped the eggs & cheese & the bacon & onions the night before. I put them in seperate containers, also put the shredded potatoes (Ore Ida) in the fridge to defrost, mixed them all in the AM & threw it in the oven. Super easy because you can prep the night before. Will be making this again.

Fantastic!  Everyone REALLY enjoyed this one Christmas morning.  I would say this recipe would feed 8 people well, but not 12. I doubled the recipes and did 1 lb bacon, and 1lb of beakfast sausag, and it was very good.  My husband thought it could have used more meat, but i liked it this way.

Very good, like a hash brown casserole, not so much like an egg casserole.  We used sausage.  Refrigerated overnight and it needed 1 hour 20 minutes in the oven to cook.

I made this for my family for Christmas morning breakfast.  I mixed the ingredients the night before so all I had to do was stick it in the oven in the morning.  I replaced the bacon with ham.  All family members liked it, and one sister asked for the recipe.  I will make it again and try it with bacon to see which version I like better.

Delish! I made this for Christmas brunch thanks to the recommendation of some ladies on a message board that I frequent. The recipe was very easy to follow. I did substitute the bacon with two packages of Morningstar Veggie Bacon Strips (ovo-lacto vegetarians in my house). I also used shallots instead of an onion since my husband does not care for onions and shallots are a lot more mild than onions. Hubby and the kids devoured every bite and kept asking for more! This is going to be a Christmas brunch tradtion, but it's so good I'm going to have to make it more often. Next time I'm going to try adding fresh tomatoes and a dash of pepper.

So good! I made this for Christmas brunch and there wasn't a spoonful left! Several people asked me for the recipe. The only thing I did different was to use a combination of mild and sharp cheddar instead of swiss and a combo of sausage and bacon. For the people who say it is bland, I would say make sure the meat is good quality. I used meat from our local market and it was far from flavorless. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy. Fast. Delicious. I did not have Swiss cheese so left that out. Used sausage instead of bacon.   I make a breakfast casserole every Christmas morning and my 19 year old son told me this casserole is his favorite. Maybe I won't make a different one EVERY Christmas! This will become my usual, with a slight variation from time to time. (I get bored of eating the same thing.)   My only issue was that it quite a bit of grease formed on top, probably from the cheese, but I matted that up with some paper towels before serving it. It did not taste greasy.

This was really good.  I was looking for a breakfast casserole that had "everything" in it...hash browns, meat, cheese and egg, and this was it.  The best part is that it wasn't too much on the egg like a lot of breakfast casseroles.  Changes I made:  I used 1# of sausage instead of bacon, and added 2 additional eggs.  I also prepared the night before and baked in the morning.  It was perfect and the reheated leftovers were every bit as good as the freshly made.  Excellent.  Will definitely make it again.

VERY good and very easy!  I pretty much followed the recipe - but made a few modifications:  Added breakfast turkey sausage, used center cut bacon (less fat), and egg substitute.  Family loved it!

We loved it, it was a lot like quiche but without the crust and it was very moist with the cottage cheese in it.  Delicious.

This was easy and real tasty, many compliments from my co workers. I have modified it several times by adding feta instead if cottage cheese, roasted red peppers

This is great!! I was skeptical when it called for cottage cheese but it turned out wonderful! I suggest using the hash browns with the onion and bell peppers included - provides a great color. I did  add some spicy sausage. It was a great additional meat and flavor overall. I added some cheddar cheese as well. Will definitely make again! Thank you for the recipe!

I thought I'd died and went to heaven when I took the first bite.  The only thing I did wrong was add too much onion.  Other than that, this was a breakfast like no other.

Made this as directed except for the swiss and the potatoes. My store didn`t have just Swiss but it did have a shredded mixture of Swiss, Gruyère and Parmesan and I used real cold baked potatoes diced cause shredding was a pain in the butt. :-).  Still turned out ok. Will make again for sure. :-)

I made this into a main course by adding mushrooms and broccoli.  The mushrooms were sauteed with the bacon & onion (after the bacon was nearly done and the onion translucent) and then added some broccoli I had thawed.  Let that mixture cool a bit before adding to the egg/potato/cheddar cheese mixture then mixed it all up and spread it in a 10 x 9 baking dish, sprinkled a bit more cheddar on top and baked for 35 minutes.  My hubby loved it.  Don't think it would serve 12...but 6 for sure.  Should be good fried for breakfast.

Made this for the first time today, actually put it  together last night, refridgerated overnight and cooked this morning.  I used American cheese instead of cheddar....I prefer American cheese to cheddar any day....it's not stringy like cheddar and I prefer the taste of American cheese.  Like other suggestions, I added green onion and red bell pepper.  I used 12 eggs instead of 6, it just needed more "glue".  I also added on cup of whipping cream.  I agree that sausage is easier to prepare, but the bacon version is awesome.  I'm definately keeping this recipe on hand for future use.  Oh, and I really like the idea of using a muffin pan to make little "take along" servings.  I'm going to try that next time.

This was good but I thought it was a little dry. If I make it again I will add a little cream and a couple of more eggs for a more custard type dish or less potatoes! I made it for dinner and served homemade applesauce and a pumpkin coffeecake. My family likes breakfast for dinner, morning are to busy for big breakfasts! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good ! I  might try sodium reduced bacon next time as I found it a little salty and also also add green onions. I will be making this on X-mas morning instead of the "wife-saver" style casserole that we normally have.

My coworker brought this in to work and it is awesome!!  She used sausage instead and did not add onions but it was still fantastic.  I am going to make it for Black Friday, my family will appreciate something filling and warm after running around all morning.

This was such a wonderful break from the usual sausage/egg casserole.  I used Monterey Jack instead of swiss and since I used a larger dish (11x15), I added about 1 cup more cheddar cheese than it calls for.  I also added 1 C. whipping cream to 7 extra large eggs, and used the entire bad of frozen (thawed) hash browns.  I diced 1 red bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper and sauteed those with the diced onion.  Will probably try adding some minced garlic to the onion/bell pepper mixture next time.  Baked for 1 hour at 350F.  Huge success!

My mum & I made this for our Apple Buuter day for the whole family.  It went over very well.  We made a larger amount, added some pork sausage to it & a little heavy cream as it felt a little dry.  We didn't add much as it was wonderful & all my sisters want to recipe.  Since we mada a big pan, it did take twice as long to bake so be aware of that when planning times to eat.

I cut the recipe in half for a test run and baked for 25 minutes. It was DELICIOUS! I did make some changes though. I used Jimmy Dean's regular sausage instead of bacon. I also didn't use the cheeses listed in the recipe (didn't have cottage cheese on hand). Kroger has a "casserole" shredded cheese (mix of different cheeses) that is thinner, so it melts more quickly. I also added broccoli because I needed a veggie and color. My father is hard to please when cooking (used to own a restaurant), and he took 3/4 of it home!

I wanted something simple and delicious for my scrapbooking group and found this recipe. Since there were only going to be 5 of us I made 2 smaller casseroles instead of the 9x13. The women absolutely loved this dish. They all made me promise to send them a copy of the recipe. I made it with breakfast sausage and it tasted great.  Served it with fresh fruit and buttery croissants. Yummy!!

Delicious!  I figured by the rave reviews that it was pretty good, but it was even better than I thought it would be. My husband wanted the leftovers for lunch the same day! YUM!

GREAT! I made this the first time for a work function just as directed and I had several people ask me for the recipe...have made it many many more times since. My husband is a bacon and sausage kind of guy so at home I tweaked it a bit and added 1lb of bacon, and 1lb of pork sausage...and up'd the cheese a little and added about 1/2 c of montery jack in addition to the swiss and cheddar and its fabulous. Great Great recipe!

Made this again last night - I switch out the bacon for a spicy sausage...but it's great either way. It's also gluten free - so DH can eat all he wants!

I added a few extra eggs... next time I will add a few more eggs, and decrease the hashbrowns a little.... it was GREAT the first time and a big hit in our hungry home!  **do NOT add extra salt- the cheeses and meat make it quite salty as is

If I could give 10 stars - this would get 10 stars.  WE LOVE THIS!  I've made this for St. Patricks Day brunch and Christmas morning breakfast for the past 2 years.  And every once and a while for a special breakfast.  Sometimes I alternate Jones' breakfast sausage instead of the bacon.

I made this for my son's golf team (eight boys) for their breakfast.  I made two casseroles and they never got into the second one, although they had other food items to go along with the casserole (fruit, cereal, and coffee cake).  I did add two eggs for a total of eight in each one.  I mixed it up the night before and refrigerated overnight so in the morning I could just place in the oven.  Skipped the onion.  It was well received!

My kids gobbled this up!  I was punting, trying to use what I had on hand.  I subbed sliced brats for the bacon, omitted the onion, subbed a small container of sour cream for the cottage cheese, and only used the 2 cups of cheddar.  I also "snuck" in some healthy purees of butternut squash, cauliflower, and zucchini (about 1/2-1 cup each).  I love it when my kids devour something like this!

I made this for a work meeting and it went FAST.  I substituted turkey bacon for the regular bacon, lowfat cheddar, and used a combination of Swiss and Gruyere cheese instead of just Swiss.  Very tasty!

I just made this for breakfast and both my husband and I loved it.  Based on another suggestions, I cooked the bacon in the oven prior to cutting and used some of the grease to fry the onions.  I only used shredded cheddar cheese as that's all I had in the house.  Even with these changes it was REALLY good!  This is a simple, tasty casserole that could easily be modified to suit your taste!  I'll definitely make this again.  Another plus: there was virtually  no clean-up (bacon pan, onion pan, bowl, spatula, knife and casserole dish).

I made this for church fellowship last Sunday and it was a huge hit.  I made one just like the recipe.  Then I made one with sausage and mozzerlla and one with ham and cheddar and mozzerlla.  The ham was my favorite but everyone else had a different favorite so that tells me that this is a very good recipe. It's also very easy to make little changes to for a different taste.

Excellent. We had people in from out of town & all 4 adults and 4 out of 5 kids LOVED it.  That's amazing to me!  It was nice and fluffy--not the dense stuff that egg casseroles usually are.   (FYI--I used mozzarella instead of Swiss & added a couple extra eggs)

I tried this dish out and added ham and group sausage. It was amazing. Its a must to add the cottage cheese too. My family does not like it so we tried it once without and it needed an extra kick. The next time we left it in and it made the difference.

I didn't care for this recipe, but the others I served it to did. I found it too rich and cheesy, with not enough egg flavor.

Overall, the flavor was good, but after 45 min. of baking, after I cut into it and served, the potatoes were still a little on the crunchy side.

This was a really good, simple recipe to make. Very fast to make, not counting the baking time, but I got the dishwasher emptied so at least I felt productive! The only change that I made was I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. My husband won't touch the stuff. Enjoyed the recipe, thanks for posting, Beth.

Really simple recipe that always turns out great even with substitutions.  I substituted the cottage cheese for sour cream or even cream cheese and the swiss cheese for pepperjack and it has turned out great every time.

This was very good... I used a package of vegetarian breakfast sausage, and added an extra egg.  I also only used two cups of cheddar and half of on onion, and it still turned out great. Thanks to the Amish!

Very good and easy. I added green pepper as was suggested by another reviewer. I also used the packaged precooked bacon and instead of the frozen hash brown potatoes. I use Simply Potatoes Shredded hash browns. Found next to the eggs in the dairy dept. of your store. I made this casserole for my husband's Aunt and Uncle. They loved it.

I make this whenever my family has out of town guests. It is a hit everytime. Instead of messing with cooking up bacon I buy the real bacon bits from the salad dressing isle...they work great and they are so much easier.

This was so yummy. As one reviewer said it's not heavy at all. I used turkey bacon instead and o'brien potatoes. I also put in a few more eggs and egg whites and a dash of seasonings. I made it for Mother's Day brunch along with the Orange Pecan French Toast and some fruit salad. Perfect meal!

Excellent breakfast casserole.  I love using the low fat cottage cheese instead of heavy cream like others call for, you could even use egg beaters of course to be even healthier.   I don't care for the way bacon turns out in casseroles so I used tiny cubed ham and left out the swiss, upped the cheddar.  I also added two teaspoons of kosher salt and a good bit of pepper.  I will definitely make this again, very easy to throw together!

Good flavor, easy to make.  I found it a little dry, maybe I baked it too long.  I will add a little milk to the eggs next time.  Garlic powder and pepper a must.

GREAT breakfast casserole!!  I received many compliments and requests for this recipe.  I took this casserole to a meeting that included men, women, teens and children and all liked it.  I did not follow the recipe exactly as it lends itself to be personalized.  I added a combination of turkey, pork sausage and bacon bits (real) to approximate 1 lb.  Another great thing about this recipe is it can be totally gluten free.   A lot of other breakfast casseroles contain bread.  This one "tastes and has texture" like it may contain bread.  WIN/WIN recipe for me.

Delicious recipe, super easy to make.  I made this for an Easter Brunch and my guests loved it.  I thought it was delicious though I did make some changes to it.  I used 1 pound breakfast sausage browned with 1/2 of a spanish onion.  The six eggs the recipe called for did not look like enough egg to me for an egg casserole so I used 10 eggs.  I also replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese due to may own personal preference.  I baked it for 40-45 minutes and let it sit for about 5 minutes before cutting it.  This casserole was easy to make and came out perfect this way.  I will definately make this again and again.  It is likely to replace my old breakfast strata recipe that I've used for years.

COOK FOR AT LEAST 60-70 MINUTES! I've made this every X-mas morning, since 2009. I also make it on special occasions- it is DELICIOUS!  We do have to cook it for about an hour every time. If there is liquid at the bottom of the dish after you cut it- that is egg, not oil, or water. When this is done cooking- there will be no liquid!  TRUST me- my daughter got sick on this because we thought the liquid was water/oil- and this was after we cooked it for 50 minutes and let it rest for 10 minutes.

I took this to work for St. Patrick's day!  Instead of bacon I did half with cooked ham and the other half with sausage.  Instead 2 C Cheddar and 1.5 Swiss Cheese I used approx 1 C Cheddar Pepper Jack Mix and it was PLENTY!  Seriously, I can't imagine this with 3.5 C of cheese.  I also added chopped green pepper and mushrooms.  It was a hit!  My new favorite breakfast casserole!

This is my new FAVE breakfast casserole.  I made for a group of girlfriends having never tried it b/f and I admit I was a little nervous serving something I had never tried before.  It turned out amazing!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  The only thing I added was some salt and pepper to the eggs and some dried parsley b/f baking.  Mmmmmm!

Like a lot of reviewers, I subbed sausage for the bacon; but even with adding some black pepper the dish still needed something in the way of spices or herbs.  Next time I'll at least kick it a bit with 1/8 tsp of cayenne and maybe some dill.  Or might use some sage sausage.

This has become a family favorite! I no longer make with bacon but sub sausage instead. I have also skipped the meat and added a cup of diced red/green peppers. Another sub was a cup of uncooked diced zucchini instead of meat. YUM!!

I made my own hash browns, because I didn't have any frozen one's. I also used 8 eggs, instead of six. I had to cook it longer than the recipe calls 4. This is the best breakfast casserole ever. My guests went back for 3rds and 4ths.

I made this casserole for a brunch with friends a few weekends back. I made one with bacon and another with sausage. I enjoyed the sausage one.  This was a hit because of the hash browns, it is gluten free and I chose it with two GF folks in mind.   Some casseroles call for bread or crutons and I actually think this was more delicious than those.  I added a green pepper to the mix and more cheese.   Two thumbs up all across the room.

I left out the cottage cheese (b/c I didn't have any) and substituted mozzarella for the Swiss cheese (b/c I didn't have any), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was AMAZING! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it was delicious! :)

For some reason this didn't set-up well with the time frame given for me.  I am thinking it may have done better if it were cooked a little longer?

Delicious!  I made this on Christmas Eve to serve on Christmas morning.  I assembled everything, refrigerated overnight, and baked in the morning.  I added 15 minutes to tha bake time.  I thought it tasted even better the day after as leftovers!  Great recipe.

Awesome!!  I was a little worried that it wouldn't make enough so I used 8 eggs, 5 cups hash browns, 2 Cups swiss cheese and left everything else the same.  It served 6 adults with just a little left over.  Everyone loved it!

We had this on Christmas morning and decided it was so good that we would make it a Christmas tradition! I used 2 cups of Ementaller cheese instead of regular 1 1/4 cups Swiss. Cooking the onions ahead of time really adds to the flavor and sets this breakfast casserole apart from others.

Yes, this was great for a breakfast crowd!  I used sausage instead of bacon and upped the eggs to 9.  Per suggestions I also pre-heated the hash browns for 10 minutes.  Finally a breakfast recipe that can be prepped ahead and you don't spend all morning at the stove.

I think this was very good. I made changes based on others reviews, so I only gave it 4 stars.  Like others  I added extra eggs, if not I can't imagine how thick it would be. I used real potatos (about 5 small to med) and peeled and grated them, used bacon and used a dozen eggs, was a big hit.  It filled a 9 x 13 pan.  I also made it the day before and took it out about a hour before cooking in the AM (saved alot of time).  I am sure this is good with less eggs - how can you go wrong with all that cheese and bacon, but I wanted it to feed 6 of us.  We had two pieces left, using a dozen eggs.

Very tasty-not too heavy. Made it exactly as described for Christmas morning breakfast (fried the bacon the day before). I served it with biscuits and orange juice. One casserole was plenty for 6 people (including 4 teen aged sons!)

Wow. probably the best breakfast casserole I ever had.  I added fresh mushrooms fried in butter to all of it.  Then to spice it up I added sauted onions & green peppers to the one side. I also sprinkled with seasoned salt. I definetly added it to my recipe box.

Excellent!  Mine had a bit of liquid on the bottom of the casserole dish after I baked it, but I stirred everything together after removing it from the oven and it didn't seem to take away from the flavor or texture.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this for the first time Christmas morning, '08 and have made it many, many times since! It's my go-to recipe when we have overnight company (I always put it together at night, refrigerate and then throw it in the oven in the morning.) I've substituted the swiss for more cheddar - I won't do that again. The swiss is what gives it it's unique flavor. I've used bacon, diced ham and different kinds of sausage - I like maple sausage best (but my husband loves it w/bacon!) It's delicious; you cannot go wrong with this casserole! Love it!!

I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could.  I usually halve breakfast casseroles but didn't today and went ahead and made a 9x13.  The five of us tore through the whole thing.  It was crazy good.  I used Butterball turkey breakfast sausage instead of bacon.  This is my new holiday casserole.

Although I've been cooking for many years, I've never actually made a breakfast casserole before.  I was very excited to have this be my first.  I used turkey bacon and added dried parsley for a little color.  I prepped the casserole the day before, but kept the bacon/onion mixture separate from the potato/egg mixture until I was ready to place the dish in the oven the next morning, because I didn't want the crisp bacon to become soggy in the refrigerator overnight.  The bacon retained its crisp texture; I think this was a good idea.   I served this Christmas morning with biscuits and honey butter.  The casserole/biscuits were done to perfection just as we finished opening our gifts, which was very, very cool.  Thanks so much for the receipe :-)

Had to leave out the cottage cheese this time for picky eaters...but this turned out pretty good even without it. I used leftover baked potatoes and grated those and used monteray jack/colby instead of swiss.  Next time I'm going to at least make some with the cottage cheese.

This was absolutely delicious and a huge hit at a brunch. I used mozzerella cheese instead of swiss because that is what i had available and it still turned out great. I will make this again, may try it with sausage next time.

It was good but may be next time I'd like to see how the original recipe of 6 eggs taste & looks like.  I used 10 -12 eggs as what others commented. I've baked it twice already & will be baking it for a brunch in the coming week.  You can say it was a hit.  I'll update this review then.

I really liked the fact that you didn't have to refrigerate this overnight.  As  others have posted here I made some substitutions only because I didn't have the exact ingredients and it came out great!. I used Jimmy Dean turkey sausage instead of bacon; I used Egg Beaters and eggs; and I cut up frozen fries since I didn't have hash browns.  This will be my breakfast casserole of choice from now on.

OMG, this was absolutely fantastic!  I made it exactly as written (with low-sodium bacon) and baked it, but did not eat it until the next day.  Delish!  Even microwaved three days later, it was still phenomenal!  The only thing I'll do different next time is use a little bit smaller "medium" onion - I used a pretty big one the first time.  And, make sure the potatoes are completely thawed, I think the middle of mine were still a tad frozen.  I can't wait to make it again!

Very easy, with ingredients that we usually have on hand. I made it the night before and baked it in the morning. I like that it doesn't take as long as the others to bake. Very tasty and satisfying.

Big thumbs up from my family.  Nice alternative to the mushroom soup soaked white bread casserole that my in-laws favor. My variation: I used a frozen onion seasoning mix instead of an onion, mixed 1/4 lb chorizo with 3/4 lb breakfast sausage.  Also, added Penzey's Foxpoint seasoning, so it had a nice layer of other flavoring.  Enjoyed it.

This was very good.  I made one pan with bacon and another pan with sausage and they were both delicious.  Next time I'll add green pepper and garlic to spice it up a bit.  I thought it would be good with salsa too.

This recipe is most definitely the best thing I have ever tasted... my mother made it for christmas morning breakfast one year, and ever since, I've been hooked. It's my all time favorite food! I requested it for my birthday this year too, and everyone loved it just as much as I do. Thanks for this great recipe!

I took this casserole to potluck bruch and it disappeared fast!  The bit I got was pretty yummy.  I had to make a couple of substitutions because I didn't have bacon and was short on cottage cheese.  I subbed a 1 pound of ground sausage for the bacon and supplemented my 1 cup of cottage cheese with a 1/2 cup sour cream.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly.  I did end up have to cook it a bit longer, but I was very pleased with the results.  I will make it again.  Thanks!

I think that both the cottage cheese and the swiss cheese make this recipe something that stands out from the rest.  I made it for an extended family Sunday brunch, and it was a hit!  I will definitely be making this one again.

I made this casserole for a breakfast after my daughter's christening. I had made two different casseroles, but this one got all the rave reviews, and was gone by the end of the meal.

Fantastic! I halved the recipe for our family of four, used four eggs total, turkey bacon, fresh red and green bell pepper, 1 cup of cheddar only and placed the hash browns on the bottom of a pie pan.

I made this for a group of guys and they loved it! I used sausage instead of bacon and it was good.It was very easy to make too. As a woman I thought it was just okay. It was really cheesy and that's not my preference. If you like cheesy potatoes then go for it.

This casserole has gone over real well with the family.  My husband made it and took it to his men's breakfast; he was one of the few to have no leftovers.  It is recipe that can be changed some and still taste great.  I have used a 1/2 pound bacon, crumbled and 1/2 pound spicy sausage; for a change of pace.

Very tasty... I will make this again.  I added some chopped red bell pepper, and substituted havarti swiss cheese for the regular swiss this recipe calls for.  At the advice of other reviewers, I added more eggs - 10 total.  I also pre-cooked the shredded hash browns in a little bacon grease before... turned out great!  Deeee-lish!

I made this for breakfast when we had some family staying the weekend. Only 3 of us ate everything on our plate. I followed the recipe with the exception of the types of cheese used(I had some cheddar and a mexican blend)and I shredded my own potatoes (placing them between some paper towels to absorb the moisture). This had way too much potato and not enough eggs. It tasted rather bland and I added S&P and garlic powder. I figured I could make it again and 'doctor' it up, but my husband said "Don't you dare!" Sorry, this just wasn't for us.

Followed exactly and got rave reviews from the family. My dad even begged for the recipe to pass onto his scout troop! The only thing I would change next time is to add broccoli.

I doubled this recipe...using turkey bacon and turkey breakfast sausage. I used 14 eggs and used a a whole 2 cups of mozarella in place of swiss, 1 1/2 cups mixed into the mix and then during the last 20 minutes I spread the rest of the mozarella on top. Very good recipe.

Very good.  I gave 4 stars because I changed the recipe somewhat. I brown the onions and hashbrowns prior just for the flavor.  I served this at a Easter luncheon and all 3 families wanted the recipe.  Loved the cottage cheese addition!  This recipe is a keeper for us.

I really like this. You can put a pound of any kind of meat in, not just bacon. I did half bacon and half sausage. Yummm... my arteries are clogging just thinking about it, but yummm nonetheless.

Made this for Mother's day brunch.  Everyone loved it!  This will be the egg casserole I make from now on.  I placed the hash browns on the bottom of the pan, added a little salt and pepper, then covered the hashbrowns with slices of co-jack cheese then toped with the egg mixture.  I cooked for 50 minutes because it didn't look set yet at 40 min.  I didn't add anything to it, it was perfect with the bacon and onion, not too heavy.  I left out the swiss cheese and added Mozzarella.

Made this for mother's day eve breakfast. Used 12 eggs, Simply Potatoes diced potatoes with onion, 3 cups of cheese, low fat cottage cheese,(2) reduced fat breakfast sausage (12oz tubes ) of Jimmy Dean brand. Next time I would add diced green chilis for more zip. I served with salsa.  This sets up beautifully, I cooked for 1 hour. Hearty casserole worthy of company.

very good.  Made for Easter brunch.  Instead of bacon I used breakfast sausage.  Also, cut the onion in half.  Makes a lot!  Also, used 1/2 swiss and 1/2 chedder.

What a great dish! to cut down on the fat and calories, I used turkey bacon, fat free cottage cheese and about half the cheese the recipe called for (what was posted seemed like WAY too much). I also added pepper and paprika - DELICIOUS! My boyfriend and I both loved it.

I made this twice so far - once for a potluck breakfast and once for Christmas Day. I found it absolutely delicious but my boyfriend and his brothers said there wasn't enough egg.  Of course, they ate the whole pan, so who knows.  I loved the cottage cheese touch too! I will make again!

Great recipe.  The only change I made was added some seasoning to the potatoes. Delicious, and freezes well. So I cut into squares, saran wrapped single portions, and put them in a freezer bag.  When needed, microwave for 1 and a half to 2 minutes. I like it with a little Hot Salsa on top.

Thankful for all the cooks that made this before me - wonderful suggestions - such as more eggs, mozzarella cheese, green peppers. I made my own shredded potatoes - only problem was that I made it the night before and some of the potatoes turned gray - didn't notice the color when it was cooked. Served 4 and there was a lot left over - could have served at least 8. Everyone wanted the recipe!

Yum!  I could eat this for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  We used canadian bacon instead of regular bacon and added 2 more eggs.  Also, next time I'll save the money and not buy the pre-shredded hash browns and just shred my own potatoes to add.

This worked out pretty well. I used  a sweetish chicken sausage, some pepper jack  and added red and green peppers. I will make it again and play around with spicing it up part. Also, it is pretty hash browny and less eggy than you might expect.

I assembled this the night before and then baked it in the morning.  Based on the other reviews, I added 3 extra eggs.  Instead of bacon, I put in veggie bacon which was ok.  I think next time I will add sausage instead.  Also, IMO there were too many onions (then again I'm not hugely into onions).  Also, next time I'd cook them before adding them to the casserole.  I just threw them in the mix uncooked.  Also, I might throw garlic in as it could've used a little more oomph!

THIS WAS A VERY GOOD RECIPE.I AM A COUNTRY GIRL SO I TRIED THIS WITH GROUND RABBIT (WHICH WAS MADE BY MIXING WITH BACON).THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS ADDING ABOUT 1/2C. BELL PEPPERS.I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN WITH THE BACON BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL HAVE A REALLY YUMMY TASTE.

This was sooo good! Such a nice change from the same ole breakfast casserole I always make! I made this for Christmas Brunch & everyone loved it! It is more of a hash brown casserole than I originally thought, but I loved it anyway! Wouldn't change a thing.

This is the VERY best breakfast casserole I have ever had! Easy to make & super yummy, don't bother with any other. I used a mozzarella and provolone shredded blend instead of the swiss and sprinkled the remaining cheese on top.

Delicious! Made this morning and my family went back for seconds! I omitted the cottage cheese since I had none and added about 1 1/2 c. of cream and 1% milk. I also used up some whole wheat and white bread ends and cut them into cubes. I layered the cubes of bread on the bottom, then the potatoes and so on. I also used 1/2 lb. of bacon and 1 box of breakfast sausage cut into little pieces. So easy and very filling. Happy New Year!

This was a hit for Christmas breakfast.  I love most breakfast casseroles but have a family member who does not so we had done simple eggs for several years and I decided to try again.  This was perfect!  I used 11 eggs and added salt, pepper and a little garlic salt.  That was just enough flavor for all my picky eaters.  Very nice texture, the potatoes are a wonderful addition and you have no idea there is cottage cheese in there.  Also quite simple so this recipe is a keeper.

I was expecting about 18 for Christmas brunch so I needed more than my traditional Guyanese Pepperpot and Garlic Pork, and something less spicy for the 'timid' palates.
This recipe made a hit, and will now become a Tradition.  I used turkey bacon and McCain's country style hash browns.

Great! I loved this casserole. I left out the onions and fried the bacon in strips, then crumbled. I also added 1/2 a pound of turkey sausage, and substituted mozzerela cheese for the swiss. It was excellent, and very easy to make!

Great! The nice thing is that the recipe lends itself to easy modification.  We used sausage instead of bacon, added some chopped green pepper, and used pepper jack cheese instead of the swiss.  Also added a couple of additional eggs. It turned out wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

I made two of these.  One for S.S. and another for the next day.  They turned out "OK", but not great.  On both I doubled the eggs, used sausage and crumpled bacon on top as shown in other reviews.  I also used garlic salt.  It turned out mushy in the middle, and tasted OK.  The 2nd one I prepared the same but added ground mustard, nutmeg and paprika.  I cooked it 50 min. This one tasted better, but didn't get any Wows.  If I make it again, I will use pepper jack cheese instead of swiss to add spice it up a bit.

This was ok-not the best I have ever had. It was a little dry and unflavorful to me. I used maple sausage and doubled the eggs. Forgot to buy cottage cheese so I didn't add that-maybe that was my problem. I might try it again with the cottage cheese-but I have a recipe for a much better casserole, IMO. I will have to post it when I find it.

LOVE IT!!! Will make over and over again. Only things I changed was increasing the eggs to 9 simply to make it go a little further.I also added garlic to my bacon & onions and I added a dash of cayenne pepper. My neighbor who hates cheese loved this and can't wait for me to make it again. Took it to work and only had crumbs left over.  VERY VERY GOOD- and SUPER SIMPLE

This was very good, but I only rated it 4 stars since it wasn't enough volume for a 9x13 pan with only 6 eggs.  I increased to 9, and still think it could have used some more.  The other quantities were exactly like the recipe, except that I added a tsp of seasoned salt since other reviewers had said it was bland. I used Simply Potatos has browns instead of frozen hash browns, and browned them and put them in the bottom of the pan so it would be more of a layered casserole.  I think the browning may have been unnecessary though.  Everything else was mixed together as a top layer.  I refrigerated and cooked it in the morning and it turned out great.  My only other comment is that 4 adults ate 2/3 of it as a main course at breakfast (and I had increased the number of eggs), so there's no way the original recipe would feed 12.

I will definitely make this again but will try increasing the eggs to 12.

I was a little apprehensive about using cottage cheese in this recipe. It turned out delicious though. I served this to guests as a light supper with a salad, and it was very tasty. I did add salt, pepper, and lawry's seasoning salt to the potato mixture. Good recipe, not sure if I would use it for breakfast though.

I made this two times and both were delicious! I was so glad to find a breakfast recipe that does not use bread.  I used bacon the first time and I wish I would have fried the bacon in strips and then crumbled it. The second time I used sausage and not so much swiss and my company at Christmas loved it.  Warms up the next day wonderfully.  This is a new breakfast tradition at my house.

Easy to make just changed the recipe a little as I am not a cottage cheese fan so I exchanged it for ricotta and it was delicious

My family and I loved this recipe. I followed some of the suggestions in other reviews. I browned the hash browns (I accidentally bought cubed hash browns so that's what was used) with some butter. I used vegetarian sausage since I don't eat meat. I used sharp cheddar more is always better :) (we love cheese) and swiss. Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I added some dry mustard since I've used so many times in other breakfast casseroles. We loved it and will make it again.

The only thing I changed was to use 10 eggs instead of 6.  Otherwise a perfect Christmas breakfast!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I am not a cook by any means.  But we were having a breakfast pot luck at work and everyone was bringing something sugary.  I thought we needed something with substance.  This recipe looked easy enough for a novice like me.  I'm still scared of my kitchen at 36yo.  It came out FABULOUS!  Very tasty and rich.  The instructions were easy to follow.  It got rave reviews from all of my co-workers.  Now they think I can cook. :)

This recipe is not only easy to make, but delicious as well.  I prepared it the night before and it turned out great. I will definitely be making it again, especially when I have company and want something special.

This is ultimate comfort food to me!!  I was desperate to make this, but had no hashbrowns-so I crumbled up tater tots (yes, desperate, I know!) and it was still way yummy!

Really good.  I will definitely make this again.  It's even good reheated, just need to find a way to keep it from getting soggy.

I also used potatoes o'brien with the peppers and onions in it and used maple sausage.  I couldn't find shredded swiss, so I took deli slices and just tore them and mixed them in.

Has a great flavor and even the kiddos liked it!

Everyone enjoyed this!  I took the left- overs to my neighbor and she demanded to have the recipe.  I made it just as it is written.  My husband asked me to add sausage to it next time. So, I will cut back on the bacon and add some sausage to it too.

I thought this dish was very good, but it seemed like something was missing and that's why i gave it 4 stars.  if i could've given it 4.5 stars i would have.  i used pork and bacon pork sausage, which was very easy.  i think next time i will add 0.5 lb. more of the sausage or 0.5 lb. more of strictly bacon, some chopped green peppers, and maybe mustard powder.  but overall it was a great recipe...would be great to freeze for when company comes...and very easy to make.  thank you for the recipe!

Made it for mothers day and it was a hit.  I used Potatoes Obrien (with peppers in them already) rather than plain hashbrowns.  Also added extra swiss and cheddar since we love cheese.  Mom said I will be making that for all family brunches from now on.

I made this last night for dinner.  The only change I made was I added extra chopped onion because we LOVE onion.  It was even better when I had left-overs for breakfast this morning. I did have to cook it a little longer than called for.  Awsome recipe.

I made this recipe for some friends in early December and for my family on Christmas morning. Very easy to make and enjoyed by all. I followed the recipe and used bacon. Plan to try with sausage the next time just to experiment.

This was a huge hit for brunch!  It was delicious and filling. I browned the hash browns before adding them, added fresh chives and sprinkled the top with more swiss cheese.

Exactly what I want in a breakfast casserole!  Only change I made was to use monterey jack instead of swiss as we don't care for swiss.  The best part is you can experiment with different cheeses everytime you make it.  I have also made this with sausage and love both versions equally!

This is my favorite go-to breakfast. Everyone I make it for LOVES it. I've found that I like it a lot better with turkey sausage instead of bacon and use cubed hash browns (mainly because it's usually what I have on hand). I make it the night before and just pull it out of the fridge while the oven preheats and cook as normal directed.

Delicious when made with hot sausage and cooked in a cast iron pan in the oven for 25 minutes. Add Sriracha to taste to the eggs before cooking or allow the family to add their own.

I added green chili, a staple to our New Mexican diet.  Delicious.  I have made it several times and it is always a hit.  Always have to bake about 10 additional minutes.  Today we rolled the leftovers into a flour tortilla for breakfast burritos on the go.

I use less Swiss cheese and more cheddar. I'm a picky eater and I find Swiss too strong. I cut up the bacon and fry it first. The onions give off too much liquid for the bacon to get crisp. Then I cook the onions in some of the bacon grease. Very good recipe, though!! It has become a staple in our Christmas brunch.

It was fairly easy to make and tasted good.  Will likely do this one again.  Also, it's easy to swap out different cheeses or meats if you want a slightly different taste.

Love this recipe, but I've altered it a bit. I use 6 eggs and 6 egg whites, and I add peppers and mushrooms for some more veggies. It takes about a full hour to bake, but it's worth the wait for the extra protein! I also add a bit of seasoning to the sautéing veggies, including salt, pepper, garlic powder and crushed red pepper for a little kick.

Fantastic recipe! 
I cook my bacon in the oven but I didn't need to cook my onions (I prefer green onions baked). 
I like to switch out the cheeses based on what I have in the kitchen. Also like to make them into cupcakes for easy grab and go and for camping trips.

I made some modifications recommended by other reviewers. I skipped the Swiss cheese, but used a little extra of the cottage and cheddar cheeses and substituted sausage for bacon, for $ reasons, based on this week's grocery prices. The eggs played a minor role in this recipe. It was pretty tasty, and I would definitely make again (with bacon next time!), and keep fiddling around with the recipe. I agree that if this was the main course for people with healthy appetites, this might serve 6, and I might like a side of fresh fruit or sliced tomatoes. If served at a buffet or potluck, I'd cut it to make at least 12 servings, probably more.

This is the first dish our Sunday School group devoured entirely.  Some had seconds and thirds.  Following is how I personalized this:  Use 3/4 cup Swiss and 2 1/2 cups cheddar cheese. Add red bell pepper. a small can of mushrooms (drained), 4 big dashes of Tabasco, and 1/16 tsp of Liquid Smoke for extra flavor. Fry / bake the bacon in strips and then crumble.  Sauté the onion in a little bit of the grease afterword. Combine ingredients the night before and bake in the morning.  Broil the dish briefly after baking to get a nice look.  Best dish taken to SS.  No “one” ingredient overpowered the others, while making several distinct.

I didn't have bacon, so I used a 1 lb. roll of Jimmy Dean sausage that I fried and crumbled instead of the bacon. It turned out delicious. I think it would also be awesome with bacon, but unfortunately I didn't have it on hand at the time. Will make  it again, and again. The family loved  it.

After reading many reviews, I made this adding 4 eggs and 1 chopped red pepper. I prepared the night before, in the fridge overnight and took it out an hour before putting it to cook. It did need more than 40 minutes to cook, more like an hour. I will make this again but next time, I'll only put in 3 cups of hashbrown and maybe add a bit of Fines Herbes and garlic powder. It was good and everyone liked it.

This is a very very good recipe.  I wanted a recipe w/no sour cream, soup, or bread.  Cottage cheese makes it more healthy.  I used less cheese, like 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup swiss with about an additional 1/4 c. cheddar and/ or swiss over top the last 10 minutes of baking.

Delicious! Logged on today, found recipe and Hubby cooked it! Added the bacon (cooked and crumbled in) and 1lb of sausage (hot)  Store didn't have the swiss cheese, so we didn't add that.  Everyone loved the dish! including picky children! Will definitely make again!

This was a crowd-pleaser.  I increased the eggs to 10 just to make sure there was more of an egg taste than a hash brown taste, and it turned out great.

Made as directed. It made a huge dish but was eaten up by my co workers.  I will definitely play with the recipe and add in more meats, veggies and try with diced potatoes.  My only suggestion would be to cook up the potatoes you use first to give them more flavor before adding them in.  I made this the night before and baked it in the morning. At first it didn't look like it was forming up so I upped the temp to 450 for ten minutes and that gave the top a nice crust.  Still didn't look set up but after arriving at work and giving it a chance to cool for half hour it was fine..

This was very good!  We had family staying over so I made this the day before & put it in the oven in the morning.  The house smelled great and everybody loved it!  I made about 1 1/2 times what the recipe called for, and with 7 people eating we still had leftovers!

I chose bulk country sausage which was wonderful. I followed the advice of others and used O'Brien Hash Browns and browned them in olive oil before adding them to the mix. I also took frozen broccoli florets, precooked them in microwave, then chopped into small pieces before adding. This casserole was a huge hit. Hubby and 6 yr. Old granddaughter are excited that there is so much we can have it again and again! My granddaughter, who is visiting, asked, "Can you teach my mom how to make this?"

This is an excellent dish! The first time I seved it, I had a brunch get together and nearly everyone wanted the recipe! I made two of them, one with sausage and one with bacon. I'm more of a sausage fan, but, I must admit, I liked the taste of the bacon one a little bit more. I've made this many times and always receive compliments. Tomorrow I am making it with the "Mom's Turkey sausage" on this website. I've already made the sausage and it smells delicious. We're having people for brunch who don't eat red meat, so we'll see how that goes.

This was a good tasting breakfast casserole. However, with the cost of bacon and various cheeses, I may reserve this for when we have overnight guests. What I do like about this is that you aren't putting a gazillion eggs in it. I would cook it the full time and then let it "set" for 5-10 minutes before serving. I would pair this with fresh fruit (slices of watermelon or cantaloupe would probably be very good with this.)

In short: good but needs tweaking. In full: I had some breakfast sausage that was too salty so I thought I'd try it in this instead of the bacon. Great choice as it mellowed the sausage just right. When I mixed the ingredients it looked really light on the egg so I added 2 more. Good thing I did, it was just right. I had more than enough cheddar so I used 3 1/4 cups instead of using any swiss. Again, very good. I will try it will some Swiss next time, but not as much as it calls for. Lastly, I only used 1/2 an onion and it was very strong (and I like onion). I'll probably use no more than 1/4 c next time. My husband, who doesn't like casseroles, liked it and said to make it again but with less onion.

Made this almost 100% as listed except I used 8 eggs and 3 cups Mexican blend cheese and 1 cup swiss cheese. I did add some salt and pepper, but it could have definitely used more. While I thought this was just "ok", my 16 year old daughter ate quite a bit of it! I think it was missing something though, just not sure what.

This is good, but bland.  I added garlic, parsley, salt and pepper.  I also left out the cottage cheese.  I used sausage instead of bacon, but I did wish that I had crumbled bacon to sprinkle on the top.  I bet that would have be tasty!

Made this for the first time this weekend when we had houseguests.  Mixed it all up the night before and then baked the next morning with no problems.  Used half shredded potatoes obrien and half plain shredded hash browns with great results.  May use a little less hash browns next time, but that's simply my taste.  Very good recipe.

We love this recipe, great for a big group. We substitute the bacon with a pound each of regular ground pork and ground italian sausage. Everyone loves to reheat this dish as it just tastes better the next day.

I have made this twice and it is wonderful!  The only changes I made were to add salt and pepper (3/4 tsp. each) as several other readers recommended.  For those who say it needs more eggs, I don't think it is meant to be eggy; the eggs just hold it all together.

I made it this weekend for a potluck brunch and it went fast.  I got several compliments. I have not made it just for my husband and me because it is rather an indulgence for just the 2 of us, but several reviewers have said they freeze it in smaller portions and I am going to do that so we don't have to wait for a special occasion or a holiday next time.

Very easy to make! I changed the bacon to breakfast pork sausage and used low fat cottage cheese. Made it the night before for my boyfriend and he has eaten it the past three mornings. Delicious!

After reading all the reviews I made this casserole for the first time for my child's 4th grade end of year breakfast.  Knowing my kids don't like swiss cheese, I opted to use 1.5c shredded colby instead.  I also used 2c sharp cheddar.  Instead of bacon, I used 1 lb of Jimmy Dean original sausage with 1/4 of a large vidalia onion.  Instead of plain shredded has browns, I used 1 whole pkg (1lb 4 oz) ore ida country inn creations peppers & onions hash browns.  I added salt and pepper to my beaten eggs and then assembled the casserole using about 1.5c small curd cottage cheese.  I baked in a glass baking dish at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  I was surprised when my daughter told me that everyone in her class ate some and loved it.  In fact she complained that I should have made one for us at home.  So I made another one for dinner, along with bacon and biscuits for sides...what can I say, we all enjoyed it greatly.  This will become a regular for us.

I made this for my Mother's Day guests and everyone really enjoyed it.  I agree with one of the other viewers, though, that it doesn't serve 12 people.  I'd say more like 9.  I'll definitely make it again!

Made this for Mother's Day Brunch and it was a huge hit. I doubled the recipe because of some of the other reviews saying that it would not feed 12 but I should not have done that. I fed 10 people and even with at least half of them getting seconds one cooking of this would have been enough. I did serve other things so maybe the other reviewers didn't. I also used sausage and I can't imagine this being any better with bacon.

Awesome dish!  I added sauteed mushrooms and used Tempeh instead of bacon for the meat.  Was a hit for Easter morning and my picky sister wanted have some leftovers to take home with her.

Love this! I made it first for Christmas, and then several times since. It has become a favorite of my husband. I usually use a Mexican cheese blend for the Swiss, only because I'm not a Swiss cheese fan. I've also used tater tots when we don't have hash browns on hand. We're having it for Easter brunch today and I am mixing it up by adding bacon AND sausage. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Made this the day before Easter 4/11, followed the recipe, but also did what others suggessted. Add 8 eggs,browned the hash browns. Will wait until tomorrow (Easter and see how this turns out, can tell you now there is no way this will serve 12 people, maybe 6 @ the most, looks good @ this point before baking, used bacon that needed to be cooked, will use pre cooked bacon next time if this is a keeper. Will update this recipe in a couple of days. Rating will depend on how well this is received by Easter gusts.

Excellent casserole just as written!  I've made & eaten a variety of breakfast casseroles and I feel that this is the most flavorful that I've ever had.  I made this for guests and everyone gave it "two thumbs up".  I'll definately put this in my "regulars" recipe file.

This is a delicious twist to bacon and eggs.  I've made it a few times and my whole family enjoys it and has asked for it over and over again.  This would be get for a potluck.  I have just used any cheese I have in the house and it always turns out fine.

Amazing Dish! My mother usually makes this for the holidays with sausage and bacon. I just made my own version with mushrooms, green peppers and turkey bacon and used fat free cottage and cheddar cheeses. I think this recipe will be delicious any way!

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I used 8 eggs.  I usually make it the night before so I have to cook it longer out of the refrigerator.  Every time i have made this everyone loves the flavors and asks for the recipe.  It is very easy to make.  Last time I made it for 6 people and we had just a little bit for left overs.

Tried this recipe for a brunch at my work when I was cooking for 20 people. I got a lot of compliments (not to mention, loved it myself!) but my only complaint is that it had to bake for TWICE AS LONG! which made my brunch a BIT off schedule. And yes, i did divide it up so it wasn't all in one big dish. it was proportionate to the recipe. I would suggest trying this out and adjusting your baking time accordingly before you cook it for a crowd!

Delicious!  I tried using 1/2 venison bacon and 1/2 pork bacon and it was excellent.  Also added a bell pepper and extra onion for our personal taste.  Like other reviewers I cooked the bacon and onion separately.

I made the 8x8" version (feeds 3-4).  I halved most of the ingredients and only thought the onion was overpowering and didn't realize I should have sauted them.  I thought this was moist and not too fattening tasting, but missing seasoning of some sort - maybe garlic?  I used hash browns with diced peppers in it.  I think mushrooms would have been a nice touch for next time.  The swiss cheese really made this unique.  It was done at exactly 40 mins.  6 strips bacon, diced;
1/4 cup onion or 1/2 cup sauted.;
4 eggs, lightly beaten;
2 cups frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed;
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese;
3/4 cup small curd cottage cheese;
2/3 cup shredded Swiss cheese;

I pre-made this for our trip to the cabin and heated it up the next morning.  Everyone loved it.

I subbed sausage for bacon and increased the eggs to 12.

I used sausage instead of bacon, omitted the onions, and added one bell pepper and 1/2 cup of frozen spinach.  It was really good.  We'll be having this again.

My entire office loved this dish. The Swiss Cheese came in a 1 1/2 cup bag. I used the entire thing. I also added some salt and pepper to the eggs before mixing them in. This is very simple and tastes delicious!

Excellent!  I added up to 12 eggs, used a bag of hash browns (which was a little over 2 cups) with peppers & onions already in them, cut out the onion, and added a little extra cottage cheese.  It still turned out wonderful and fed a few more.

My family..3 boys and my husband enjoyed this! This is the first casserole of this type we have all liked. Made it for New Years Day! I forgot the cottage cheese even though I had it, I added an extra egg and it turned out fine!!! I did cut back on the swiss cheese....I would also say this serves 6.

I made a pan of this just for myself.  Stored it in the fridge and cut a square out for breakfast every morning and threw it in the microwave.  It was great to have a hot breakfast as I was running out the door. I used turkey bacon which was just fine with me.  I plan to make this again for New Years brunch too.  I'll make this batch with sausage per the hubby's request. Thank you for a new family staple!

DELICIOUS!!  We are a vegetarian household, so I left out the bacon and added red peppers.  Also added an extra egg and used about half the cheese.  Sprinkled the top generously with paprika.  Terrific results.  It easily fed 5 people with leftovers.

Made this for Christmas brunch.  I couldn't find shredded swiss cheese (plus I don't care for it) so I used all cheddar.  Very, very good.  Leftovers are also good reheated.  Highly recommend.

Yum!    I can seeing adding different things based on individual tastes.  I made it as is and loved it.  I think I will try peppers and ham next time or maybe a sauteed zucchini/squash/mushroom combo.  Great base!

Just made this for our family Christmas brunch and it was a hit. I did use mozzarella cheese instead of swiss. I also cooked the onion in the bacon grease after I'd already finished with the bacon. Just made things easier. Will definitely use this recipe again next year!!

After reading reviews I made it with breakfast sausage (Jimmy Dean in the 1lb tube/package) i/o bacon, 1 yellow onion (could not get sweet without buying a whole bag), Southwestern hash browns, and I used a 3-cheese Mexican blend and Mozzarella i/o Cheddar and Swiss. I think the cheese was where I messed up as perhaps the Mex blend was too mild tasting b/c I found the casserole a bit bland.   It actually tasted better cold, so I will make this again, with bacon and with the cheeses noted, and again with sausage and the cheeses noted.  Don't get me wrong--this was not a bad dish, but it didn't POP OUT, however I think it was my fault for veering too far from the original recipe. Still, it's very quiche-y and tasty cold so it's by no means a write-off and we will polish off the rest this weekend.  :)

This recipe is fabulous!  Made it previously as directed then made it this morning with a little modification for our family - even better.  I love that you can tweak this easily to fit individual/family taste.  I forgot the swiss at the store - no worries - I used a 4 cheese blend and...drumroll - pepperjack cheese!  Since we were serving the fellas - I used two rolls of Jimmy Dean (browned with the onion and added a red pepper) and then added a few more eggs (used just the whites since it already had 6 eggs...perfect!  New family favorite for sure!

Great recipe!  If you want to spice it up, add 1/2 teaspoon of dried whole thyme and  1/8 teaspoon of garlic salt.

This is such a great recipe. I did add a can of Rotel for extra zing. And a bit more spices (cumin and garlic with just a dash of cayenne) just because our family likes spicy.

If you're looking for a "healthy" breakfast casserole, you're out of luck.  This, however, is a really tasty breakfast casserole.  I was skeptical, at first, about the amount of Swiss cheese but the Swiss and cottage cheese are key to giving it a wonderful smooth, creamy texture.  I made this for a few friends at work and now I'm going to have to bring it in for everybody at our next potluck because it was so popular.  It's very simply but the taste and texture are just awesome.  It's also surprisingly not heavy so you won't wear down your whole day if you have it first thing in the morning.  Highly recommend it.

Loved it!  I used all cheddar because that's what I had on hand.  I'm anxious to try it with swiss.  I was worried that since it doesn't say to saute onions that they might not be soft enough for me.  To make it quick I just omitted them.

Delicious!  Absolutely delicious!!  I did add one extra egg, other than that I didn't change a thing.  We had 8 houseguests this weekend, and each one raved about this recipe.  I will definitely save it as a favorite.

This was delicious and super easy.  I served it at a family gathering for brunch and there wasn't a bit left!  I omitted the cottage cheese and swiss and added more cheddar.  I also added sliced fresh mushrooms.

I've made this for my family and they LOVE it! I made a turkey bacon version and a sausage version. They both turned out great. I used  3 eggs and then egg whites and 2% cottage cheese. I didn't have shredded Swiss cheese on hand, so I used Mozzarella instead. I highly recommend making this!

Used this recipe for a carry in breakfast. Doubled everything EXCEPT the shredded swiss (ended up about 3 quarters of a cup shredded swiss per pan) to make two 9x13 breakfast casseroles. It was very well received. The swiss gave it just enough tang to really be memorable and make you want more. Thanks for sharing!

This was good AND easy! Perfect for a lazy Sunday breakfast. I changed only a couple of things, just personal preference. I used southern style potatoes o'brien so I left out the onion the recipe called for. Made with bacon and added 9 eggs, 1 teaspoon of black pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons of Johnny's seasoning. Other than those small changes, I made as directed. Making this as part of Easter brunch tomorrow!

I made this for a brunch yesterday and followed almost exactly as written with the exception of adding an extra egg (lost count) and using more cheddar cheese instead of swiss (I had none). It was FABULOUS! I may have cooked it a bit longer, I took it out when the edges were starting to brown a bit, and it was perfectly cooked. Definitely a hit with out friends!

Really good recipe. Made it over Christmas for visiting family. They all went back for seconds. I used a pound of Bob Evans, original recipe, instead of bacon. Delicious and it also re-warms well.

Very easy to prepare and oh, so good. Pure comfort food! I accidentally picked up the southern-style hash browns instead of the shredded kind, but those worked just as well, presumably. We had it with bacon this time, but I'd like to try using sausage next time. Because there will *definitely* be a next time.

Loved it! Used sausage instead of bacon and didn't bother with the Swiss cheese. Great brunch casserole. Hearty and filling...

I leave out the swiss and ham is not bad in the casserole either.  I half the recipe and add an extra egg or so.

Just ok.  Not a whole lot of flavor, and I even added a red bell pepper.  Be sure to add some salt also.

Love this recipe - with just my husband and I, this makes 'breakfast squares' for the entire (4-day) week. I use Egg Beaters for the eggs - pre-shredded Taco cheese, add about 2 cups of frozen chopped spinach and a can of corned beef hash for 'meat and potatoes'.  Then seasoning (I use Emeril's, onion powder and fresh ground pepper) and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.  Nutritious and delicious (even my 'vege-phobic hubby likes it!).

This is a really yummy breakfast casserole!  I didn't have any hashbrowns so I tried to shred up some cold baked potatoes - that didn't work so well. I'm going to try frozen hashbrowns next time.  I also didn't have swiss - so I used mozzerella.  My husband really enjoyed this!

This was absolutely delicious!  I have made it repeatedly for holidays and when I have company.  I like veggies and cheese.  So I added tomatoes  & spinach when I sauted the onions. I also crumbled some Feta cheese in addition to sharp cheddar (I don't like Swiss).  Make this and your guests will want the recipe.  I didn't use the thick hash browns, as some others suggested.  I was pleased with the shredded hash browns-I did bake them in the casserole dish for 10 minutes prior to adding the egg mixture.

My family loved this. My meat and potatoes boyfriend requests this when I visit. I also added more eggs and bacon and cut the hash browns in half, as well as using ricotta cheese instead of the cottage. I also added a splash of whipping cream so that had more moister. This recipe is a keeper.

This was excellent! Next time we'll add sausage with our bacon or double the bacon. I guess we're REAL meat-lovers! ;0) I love that there's no bread in this and one of the other reviewers is right on when they said it wasn't too heavy. Absolute keeper!

This was easy to prepare and got lots of compliments.  This would be a good recipe to make up the evening before and store in the fridge until ready to bake it the next morning.

Delicious! I made it for Christmas morning and all of my guests raved! I did change the recipe a bit. Instead of swiss, I used cheddar. I also substituted half of the hash browns with frozen breakfast potatoes w/ onions and peppers. I have made this 4 more times in 2 weeks. I like to also dip it into a little ketchup. This is definitely a new Christmas tradition!

This went over very well on a cold, New Year's Eve morning.  I didn't have a poound of bacon on ham, so I Did 1/2 bacon and half sausage.  I both up very finly and drained the grease well after cookign with the onions.  I also did not have any swiss cheese, so I ended up using less chesse and substituted the swiss with feta.  It gave it a nice zing.  Cooking it a bit longer gave it a browned, crunchy topping everyone loved. Easily doubled for a crowd. Yummy!

I really like this recipe. I needed something that I could quickly reheat in the mornings for breakfast before work. This reheats beautifully and is very tasty. I left out the onion and used only cheddar cheese, since I couldn't find shredded Swiss. I also added about half a bag of fresh spinach, torn into pieces, to get some fiber and vitamins. I baked these in a muffin pan for 35 minutes; they were cooked but they didn't hold their shape well. Next time I will probably bake for 40. Definitely going to use this the next time I have overnight guests.

First, I can't cook bacon to save my life..I always burn it no matter how how I try. Therefore, I used sausage, and ham cubes. I LOVED IT. What a perfect christmas morning breakfast.

I made this casserole for Christmas morning guests and it was a hit!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I had the small cubed hashbrowns instead of shredded.  I love potatoes so you can't go wrong as far as I'm concerned, however, I'll try shredded next time just to see what the texture difference would be like.  I have to echo what a few other reviewers have mentioned: this is the breakfast casserole recipe I've been looking for.  Delish!

I made this casserole for my family on the occassion of our daughter's birthday in early December, and it was such a hit that we were asked to make it again for Christmas morning.  So easy to put together, and a complete breakfast in one dish!

Subbed sausage for bacon, had no onion.  Everything else was exactly as written.  This was delicious!  I had 3/4 of my children home for Christmas, they all enjoyed this.  Thank you.

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm!  One of the best breakfast casseroles I've ever tasted.  I used a pound of sausage instead of the bacon.  It got 4 thumbs up out of 5 at our house for dinner but I have very, very picky teenage girls.  The one that "didn't like" it still ate every bite.  I served it with pancakes and we had over half leftover.  Very filling!

WOW, this was a FANTASTIC casserole! I sub'd mozerella for swiss since I don't like swiss, but followed the recipe other than that. It would be great to make the night before and then just throw in the oven in the morning!

We made this recipe for Christmas breakfast. It was very good. Even my nephew who does not like eggs liked it. The kids coated it in ketchup for an extra bit of flavor. Turkey bacon was good in it; however, the bacon does not taste as good the next day. Otherwise even the leftovers were good.

One word: Amazing!  There were 6 of us at Christmas breakfast, and there was absolutely none left.  I took others' suggestions and used a pound of breakfast sausage instead of bacon, which I am so glad I did!  I also had to use regular vs. shredded frozen hash browns, but it didn't make a difference; it was delicious!  Hubby has already requested that I make it again in the very near future!

This was almost finished by 6 adults on Christmas morning.  Everyone loved it, so I'll keep it in mind next time I need a brunch recipe.  I used diced up ham instead of bacon and skipped the onion since I didn't need to fry anything.  Everything else I did exactly as stated.  Thanks, great recipe!

I made this for Christmas morning.  We all loved it.  My son was with me while I was shopping and he saw the bag of frozen potatoes that are little tidbits with onion and peppers, and he wanted that.  It tasted really good.  My son in-law wanted the recipe!

Made this for Christmas Brunch today! This is absolutely DELICIOUS! HUGE hit! I made two small changes: I shredded my own potatoes in my food processor...(preservative free that way...and much tastier!) And I used a little less Swiss cheese and a little more cheddar (personal preference). I will keep this recipe and make it over and over. I also took the suggestion of cooking the bacon alone and crumbling, then adding the onion to a little bacon grease and then cooked them alone. I think maybe next time I will saute some green pepper and mushrooms with the onion and add those in. Wonderful! Thanks for this recipe!

I made this for my family on Christmas morning, and they all loved it. In hindsight, I probably should have used the sausage instead of the bacon, since it would be easier to dice. But all in all, it came out perfectly. Thank you very much for the recipe, & Happy Holidays.

This was pretty good - actually better warmed up the next day. I prepped everything the day before. We browned the hashbrowns, onions and added green pepper. Someone else wrote this, but for such a fattening dish, you would expect it to be really good, but it was ok.

I tried this with sausage, and then with bacon.  The bacon was the winner.  I used frozen hashbrowns with peppers and my husband said that the sweetness of the peppers took away from the cheese blend.  This is a winner.

Very satisfying! I'm not a breakfast eater but my husband is. We both liked it and even enjoyed leftovers. I used sage sausage and garlic powder. I can see myself using this as a base recipe and doing lots of different variations. Such as, adding a can of Rotel.

This is an excellent breakfast casserole. Used Jimmy Deans Hot Sausage, instead of bacon, just because we love sausage. Will try with bacon the next time I make this, and there definately will be a next time. Leftovers taste great, and heat nicely in the microwave.

What a great dish!!! I used eggbeaters, and turkey breakfast sausage, low fat cream cheese, and low fat cottage cheese. Added a chopped green pepper, and a bit of garlic. Took it to a tailgate party for brunch, and got lots of great compliments!! Thank goodness there was a tiny bit leftover for my breakfast the next day!! Thank you Beth for this great recipe!!

I make this recipe all the time.  As is, it's great.  I usually add 3 more eggs though.  I've made it with bacon, ham, and sausage at different times and have used many different kinds of cheese. We have chickens so it's a great way to use up the extra eggs and everyone loves it.

I use vegetarian "sausage" crumbles instead of bacon.  And I also like to add some chopped green pepper.  I make this for a great, hearty holiday breakfast on Thanksgiving and Christmas and it holds us over until our big family dinners.

A++!  This was really, really good.  I halved the recipe and there were still leftovers!  I used southern sytle hashbrowns (instead of shredded) and it turned out great.  YUMMY!!!

Wonderful! I didn't have the shredded hashbrowns so I used another type, I wish I hadn't cause I could see how much better the shreds would have been.

I made this for our women's ministry meeting and got rave reviews.  I did substitute a couple of things, simply because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used breakfast sausage instead of bacon, and half sharp cheddar cheese and half mild.  I also used a couple more eggs than it called for after reading prior reviews.  It was really delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made two of these one morn for a crowd. One was made with the original recipe (10 eggs and fresh grated potatoes on both) and the other with chorizo sausage and mont. jack. The bacon one disappeared and had much more flavor when I was thinking it would be the other way around. On my way to cook up another bacon dish for this weekend...great recipe.

This was fantastic although I did make a few changes.  To save a little $$$ I made my own fried potatoes ahead of time with butter, onion, red pepper, salt and pepper.  Like others suggested I used 12 eggs instead of 6.  I also used an Italian blend instead of Swiss.  Swiss would have been better but they didn't have any already grated at my store and I was being lazy.

The taste is wonderful!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it takes a long time to make and there is a lot of prep.  I feel like I could have made each ingredient individually and it would have been just as good and easier.  Next time I'll make it the night before and just bake it in the morning.

This was really good (a little bland but overall tasty).  I used bacon and sausage, 12 eggs, and 4 cups of cheddar cheese. I decreased the amount of swiss cheese to about 1/4 cup. I cooked the hash browns ahead of time with onion to make sure they were crisp.  Overall a great recipe.

I added garlic powder, salt, pepper and cajun seasoning.  I laid the cooked bacon pieces on top, and layered sliced swiss on top cooked covered with foil, Was still a little runny at 45 mins, removed the foil and cooked a little longer.  Turned out great, and wonderful as leftover, I will make this again.

This recipe was excellent! I did make some changes. I used a dozen eggs and added 1 sauteed bell pepper. I also thawed the frozen shredded potato in the hot pan after I sauteed the veggies. I made two dishes with this recipe. One with turkey bacon and one without.I added some salt to the dish with out the turkey bacon. I also used Mozzerella cheese instead of swiss. They both turned out great. I used two 8inch square pyrex dishes. It worked out perfectly.

I halved the recipe and followed the directions to a T (with the exception of using fresh "Simply Potatos"). It had a wonderful flavor, was very easy to make, and is definetely a keeper.

ETA:  This IS my "GO TO RECIPE"!  Everyone I make it for asks for the recipe.  Serve with fruit and cinnamon rolls and you have a complete, impressive breakfast.  

Very good!  I made this when my in-laws came to stay.  Everyone liked it very much!  The only thing I did differently was add an extra egg, but only because I wanted to finish the carton!!  Very yummy the way it is!

We made this recipe for brunch on my daughter's 3rd birthday, and there was nothing left!  Everyone asked about the recipe, and we're making it for Easter at my in-laws.  Thank you!

This was great. I made it yesterday for a birthday brunch. I made mine with sausage, I had several requests for the recipe and they were very surprised to learn that there was cottage cheese in it. I'll be making it again I'm sure.

This was great.  A nice change from the typical breakfast casserole.  I stuck to the original recipe other than adding a tube of country sausage as well as the bacon.  It gave it a nice kick.  Great for dinner as well.

I followed the recipe exactly and did not like the final product. It was easy to put together but for my family it was too much swiss cheese and not enough egg. It could have used some more seasoning as well. I won't make it again.

Made this for breakfast for my coworkers this morning and liked it so much that I ran out and got the ingredients to make it again for my family.  I'm not a fan of cottage cheese but you'd never know it was there!  I used both bacon and sausage.  Serve it with a little salsa for an added "zip."

I made this on a recent trip with my large group of friends and they loved it. i did replace the bacon with sage pork sausage but i'm sure the bacon would be good too. i will definitely be making it again on my outings with a crowd of friends.

I love breakfast casseroles! We have a large family that visits often and making "breakfast" the night before is a great time saver. I am always looking for a new twist on the old favorites. This is our new favorite! The swiss cheese really changes up the flavor. I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe!

I have made this recipe 4 times since Christmas and my son said this will be his request for his birthday meal. I am a vegan, so I can only say that nothing was left each time I made it. That's a keeper.

This was really good.  I did change up the recipe some for our own tastes and what was on hand - omitted the onion, used sausage instead of bacon, and used mozzarella cheese instead of the swiss.

This is the best breakfast casserole that I've ever had. I made it for our New Years' Eve brunch for family. I crossed my fingers & hoped for the best.  I used sausage instead of bacon & the results were outstanding..everyone loved it.  Can't wait to try it again with bacon.

I made this for Christmas morning.  The only thing was I didn't have swiss cheese, but I had shredded mozarella cheese and substituted that.  It was still WONDERFUL!  Made a large casserole dish, and in two days my son had eaten three-quarters of it.  Thank you for this great recipe!  It will become a Christmas morning tradition in my home!

I served this casserole Christmas morning and it was a huge success with everyone.  It is so simple to prepare (I cooked my bacon the day before & warmed under the broiler before adding to recipe).  I also used seasoned hash browns, instead of plan, by OreIda.  I was tempted to leave the cottage cheese out - boy, I'm glad I didn't.  My father-in-law rated this as his favorite and he made the casserole for out of town guest New Year's Day.  I can say that this recipe will be our Christmas morning breakfast for years to come.

This was so good! I used frozen cubed potatoes instead of shredded. I didn't cook the onions with the bacon. I threw them in raw and they cooked fine. I really don't like cottage cheese but it didn't matter because you can't tell that it's in there. I threw in a couple of extra eggs and cooked it for 50 minutes. Perfect!

This was very good. I did not have swiss cheese so I use a combo of shredded cheddar and jack. Otherwise, I used all other ingredients as listed. Very easy, filling and tasty. I will definitely make this again.

I got lots of compliments on this casserole! I followed the recipe for the most part, but used mozzarella instead of swiss cheese because I couldn't find shredded swiss cheese. It turned out great! You can't really taste the eggs or cottage cheese, so don't be afraid to put everything in. It went really far...fed 4 on Christmas morning, then I took the leftovers to a Christmas brunch later that day too!

I made this for Christmas Breakfast today. I intended to follow the recipe with a few tweaks. I used mozzerella in place of the swiss and I used leftover ham from christmas Eve dinner. I also used nine eggs. I assembled it on xmas eve and took to my daughters xmas morning. It was very good. We also had biscuits and gravy. It fed 4 adults and there was half a pan left. Great recipe and I will be making it again.

Awesome!  I used hot pork sausage instead of bacon and used pepperjack cheese in place of swiss. Also cooked southern hash browns with the sausage and onions....mmmmm.  Turned out great!  A new family hit.

This is a great recipe, I just made this last night for hubby and I to have to take for breakfast to work for the week and it is fantastic. Very simple to prepare and for an extra yummy flavor add a little seasoning salt to the eggs and pop under the broiler for a couple mins after it is done baking to toast the cheese a bit. Fantastic!

I loved this, I used sausage and I put mushrooms in this. I read the others and I agree that this had way to much swiss cheese. I used the cheddar and peper jack, I was also worried about the cottage cheese, you could not even taste it. I made one for my husbands work and the guys loved it, they ate it all!

I have made this a couple of times for a staff meeting and everyone loves it, there usually are no leftovers!  I make it with sausage instead of bacon, and mexican blend shredded cheese instead of putting in swiss.

Very good, but heavy. I like more eggs in my breakfast casseroles, so next time I will probably double the eggs.

This was an excellent breakfast casserole.  I did add 1 lb of Owens regular sausage, and it was great!  This will definitely be added to my regular rotation.

It was okay.  It really needed something though, a little more spice.  I did add 2-3 more eggs though.  I am going to try using breakfast sausage next time.  I will make again, but I think I will experiment more with the seasonings.

Perfect combinations.  Some breakfast casseroles are too bland or too heavy, this is a good combination of texture and flavor. Easy to make also.

I followed this recipe precisely.  I found it to be too cheesy, and blah tasting.  I had to eat all the leftovers over the next week because my family wouldn't eat this- and I hate to waste food. Sorry.

Wonderful though I made a few minor changes.  I used the called for amount of Cheddar but I shredded my own and made it aged cheddar.  I do not care for Swiss, so I used equal parts Asiago and Monterray Jack instead.  I also substitued Maple and Brown Sugar breakfast sausage, with casings removed, in the place of bacon.  I also left out the cottage cheese because my husband does not like it.  I used 4 eggs and 4 egg whites to make it a little more healthy.

This is a great breakfast casserole!  

I made this dish for Easter 2008 and it was a hit.  I read through the previous comments and did a few modifications as well - put in sausage & bacon, dash of garlic salt, and added salt and pepper.  The cook time is also longer than 35 minutes

This is soooo good. I doubled the recipe and had one casserole at home and took one to work. The family ate it up. My co-workers all loved it! Everyone asked for the recipe. The only thing I did differently was use 1 lb of sausage and 1 lb of bacon. Did not have any swiss, so just doubled the cheddar. Delicious!!

Maybe I was expecting too much because of previous reviews.  Only change I made was to use Colby Jack instead of Cheddar and Swiss (what I had on hand).  This dish was just OK!  Tasted more like a  hashbrown casserole that you would serve as a side dish for supper rather than a  breakfast casserole you would eat first thing in the morning.  :(

I made this for Christmas morning, and my family absolutely loved it! It was so easy, because I had cooked the bacon/onion mixture, along with a little red pepper, the night before. I also added a little leftover Christmas eve ham. I've tried other egg bakes, and have never found one I like!  This one is the best!  This will be a staple for special weekend breakfasts!

Very good and easy to assemble.  My family loved it.  I did add some onion powder as one reviewer suggested, and fried the bacon in strips first, then crumbled them on top before baking.

We fixed this for Christmas breakfast & it was a real hit.  Will definitely make again, but with more bacon (only had about a half a pound).  The only problem was that it wasn't a recipe that could be made ahead & popped into the oven in the morning.  Only real change that I made was I cooked it at 450 for 20 minutes & still let it rest for 10 minutes.  Worked perfectly (at least in my oven).

I made this for our annual Christmas breakfast.  I choose to  make two different varieties:  one with bacon and onion and the other with sausage and chives.  I took other reviewers advice and added an extra egg and slightly increased the cooking time.  Both of these versions went over very well and will use them again.

Rather disappointing.  It really tasted quite bland.  Next time I think I will add something with flavor to it.  Maybe a couple cans of mild green chiles and some salsa.  Or possibly some garlic and Italian seasonings.  Maybe it just needs veggies like spinach or broccoli.  It really needs something to jazz it up.  Sorry.  My kids ate only a couple of bites and my guests told me not to bother to make it again.

Really tasty! I didn't have any curds so I just adjusted the recipe to 8 eggs and a bit more of each cheese. I think this would be fantastic with a spicy sausage and some peppers as well.

I thought this was very good but not all of the family liked it.  I used about half a lb. of maple flavored bacon and cooked it before baking the cassarole. I will make again but maybe try it with sausage.

This recipe is very customizable. I substituted sausage for the bacon and added habanero sauce and ground red pepper to spice it up. This recipe just begs for you to add whatever you love the most, because the potatoes/cheese mixture is a little bland by itself. Three of us ate, two had seconds, and I had plenty of leftovers to freeze in individual portions and pop out when I need a quick meal. Delicious!

I used deer sausage instead of bacon, hoping it would give it more spice.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  The blandness of the potatoes and eggs left much to be desired for.  Maybe add some jalapeno's or chile's next time.  If nothing else, some crushed red pepper would be welcome to your tastebuds.

Very tasty though needs salt and pepper added. It had a nice texture and served easily. I like it with a cajun twist with garlic and green peppers saute'd with the onions and sausage.
