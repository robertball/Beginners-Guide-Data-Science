I was surprised that my food processor could handle half a recipe of this, but it did!  I had to scrape it from the sides a little, but it made it easily!  My basil was almost at its end-of-the-season yellow, but it still worked!  This is delicious!  I will definitely make this again!  It was perfect with Pulled Pork Pesto Sandwich from this site.

I'm not sure what to think of this. Normally I love garlic and spicy but with just 8 basil leaves (I actually used 10 of the biggest I could find on my plants) this is really, really garlicky and the whole teaspoon of red pepper flakes makes it mighty spicy. To me this is more of a flavored oil than a spread. I made mine in the blender and it is thin. I toasted some sourdough bread, poured a bit of this on and topped with Parmesan. It's ok, but I won't be making it again.

I didn't have a food processor on hand and didn't need a lot of this so I just used a knife. It came out very good.

Doesn't really come out creamy like the recipe claims. Just oil with basil and garlic in it. Tastes okay.

I tried again using milk as a base to make the spread creamier, and it was, but it was still pretty much what you would get just crumbling up garlic onto bread. The strong flavor of the garlic very much overpowers the basil, and my tongue was burning (I probably spread it on too thick). 

I want to like this recipe but I think it needs something else to make it work.

This is a must to go with the Stromboli Grinder (Allrecipes) that references this ingredient/sauce. This is delicious with the yummy layers of meats, cheeses, marinaras and mascarpone. Definitely a must with this sandwich and I am going to try this on other sandwiches too. YUM!!!!

Great easy to make sandwich spread.  The volume of this recipe didn't work in my food processor, just wasn't enough of it, but my mortar and pestle made fast work of it.

You've got to LOVE garlic & basil for this, but if you do, you will love this spread.
I doubled the recipe, and used half EVOO & vegetable oil. It tastes just okay fresh, but after you leave it in the fridge overnight it is amazing.
Make a tomato sandwich, skip the mayo and use this instead. Yum!

As written, this was all garlic and heat and nothing else. I tasted it and added way more basil (used up the rest of the little clamshell) and some salt, and it became magical.
