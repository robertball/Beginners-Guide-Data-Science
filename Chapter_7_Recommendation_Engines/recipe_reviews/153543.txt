I made a few changed.  I used all fresh vegetables (including some green beans).  I sauted the veggies for a few minutes to release the flavor and make them tender.  I added rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper, fresh garlic, and parsley.  Instead of turkey broth, I used chicken broth (it's what I had on hand).  All in all, it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

Y'all have got to make this! It is the best pot pie I have ever had. I did use 6 oz. of chicken instead of turkey and I used diced potatoes that I boiled in a little salt instead of the canned kind. My daughter doesn't like rosemary or any of the other "grown-up" spices, but she ate this without looking up.  I am wondering how the mix will freeze and thaw with the pie crust added on demand at a later date.

In response to Miss 1977 this pot pie freezes well for extended times. I use the "Seal-A-Meal" method and all my dinners give me rave reviews.

My grandma always used to make pot pie with the leftover turkey from thanksgiving.  But, I never knew how she did it.  This recipe makes it so simple.
