I did not have fresh parsley so about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dried worked fine. The eggs were sort of out of place next time I will not include thme. It had a wonderful flavor and I will make this again!

This is an absolutely delicious dish! Easy to make filling and delicious. I used pre-packed red peppers and just cooked them alittle longer in the beggining.

Great recipe! I wanted to try something different with the tuna I had left over. This was just the right thing for a pleasant summer sandwich.

What a unique tuna sandwich! I used dried parsley but otherwise no changes. I'm not sure if I like the eggs placed on top and if I make this again I will probably incorporate them into the tuna; instead of heating it I will probably serve it cold.
