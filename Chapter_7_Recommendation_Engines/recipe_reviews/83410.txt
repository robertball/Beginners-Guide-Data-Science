I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because the first time I made it I thought it was good but needed improvement.  Here are the changes I made to suit it more to my tastes and to make it a little healthier:
reduced oil to 1/3 cup (don't reduce the oil too much, it adds to the richness!);
added some chopped white onion; 
added more minced garlic; 
instead of pureed tomatoes, I opened a can of petite diced tomatoes and blended half of it, then added the blended tomatoes as well as the rest that were in the can; 
squeezed the juice of one small lemon into the sauce near the end to brighten the flavor a little.
  I thought it was really good!

Delicious.  Had I had some chicken handy, I would have added it...but it was good without it.  Loved the fresh veggies and the only change I made was to toss in a few shakes of Italian seasoning and use fat free sour cream as opposed to cream since to me, it adds a lot of flavor.  And I decreased the oil by a lot - don't think there is a need for a full 1/2 cup!  Nice and simple, will use again.  Thanks.

I had to make some changes to due to the ingredients that I had on hand.  I only had 2 portobella mushroom caps, so I sliced and cut them into bite size pieces.  And I didn't have any canned tomatos so I chopped 2 small ones and put it in the food processor.  Had I had the correct ingredients, this would have been little time consuming to make.  I also used only 1/4 cup olive oil and half & half in an attempt to reduce calories.  Because I didn't use heavy cream it didn't get as thick as it was supposed to, but the fresh veggies really stood out.  It could still use a little tweaking to make it an awesome dish, but it definitely has the potential.

REALLY GOOD and very easy recipe that tastes like more time was spent in the kitchen.  The first time around I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  The second time around I liked it even more by cutting the oil to 1/4 cup and using 1/2 cup half & half and 1/2 cup low fat milk.  Thanks for the recipe -  I will be making it again!

Very tasty.  Cut oil to 1/3 c.; added 1/2 yellow onion, diced; subbed milk for cream and added some flour and corn starch; added splash of vodka, 1 t. oregano, and 1 t. tarragon to sauce.  Wish I would have made more to have some leftovers.

Just finished scraping the last of this sauce off the pan - yum!! I used less olive oil and fresh tomatoes plus a little tomato puree since I didn't have canned - taste was so good before the cream that I almost didn't add it! But it was awesome with the cream too. Served it over chicken cooked with salt, pepper and a little paprika. Thanks Anita! :)

Great recipe! We're not big on tomatoes and this scored high with all. Used 1-2 tb sp olive oil because you don't need much. Diced petite tomatoes, added lemon juice for some acidity. Then spinach and capers because I love them. Used 1/2 c of half-n-half and it was delicious. Hubby (who isn't crazy about asparagus) really loved it and told me not to change a thing. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!

This was very good.  I made a few minor alterations.  First, I browned some chicken breasts with salt and pepper in olive oil and set them aside.  I picked up with the recipe as written from the beginning at that point, and I just added the chicken back in with the tomato puree.  Then instead of cream, I used 1 cup of rice milk mixed with 1 tbsp. flour (I can't tolerate a lot of dairy!).  When I  served it, I topped it with a little shredded low fat mozzarella.  My six-year-old loved it.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious and incredibly easy! I used crushed tomatoes and canned mushrooms as it's what I had to hand. I added lots of oregano and basil, finished it off with romano cheese. I used half & half and cut back on the oil. My pasta choice was whole wheat spirals. Ate this with a salad of purple onions, crumbled feta, dried cranberries, green pepper,garbanzos, baby romaine, and summer corn. Divine! This will go into the regular line up!

This recipe is great!  As someone who doesn't really enjoy cooking, and who really enjoys eating, this was perfect.  I listened to the other reviewers who said to use 1/2 cup light sour cream instead of heavy cream.  I also topped it with some torn spinach.  The only qualm I had was the amount of oil; I will definitely cut it next time.  The sauce was a little only the oily side, but nothing awful.  Overall, a very tasty dish.

This was surprisingly tasty and good as a quick meal using up bits and pieces. I forgot to put the grated cheese on top but it was still a lovely dish.

I don't agree at all with the reviewers who thought this recipe was bland!  They must be missing some taste buds I have or something because this dish was incredibly savory and delicious.  That coupled with how easy it was to make ensures I will make it again and again, though I'll probably add chicken or shrimp just because I like a little more protein in my meals.  The only thing I changed in the slightest was that I didn't have pureed tomatoes so I blended a can of diced tomatoes instead; I would be surprised if this affected the taste much at all.  I was a little concerned that the asparagas would be mushy since it basically cooked for 35 minutes, and I considered decreasing the time but in the end I chose to follow the recipe exactly and I'm glad I did.  It's amazing that something with so few ingredients, that requires so little effort, can taste so good!  There are a lot of points where you're just standing around waiting for the meal to cook but I just set a timer and did other things around the house- and, my kitchen was clean when I finished cooking!  That NEVER happens!

This was quite good!  I made almost exactly as written.  I used diced tomatoes in their juice and added grilled chicken and some Italian seasoning.  I did not find it bland, but it still seemed to be missing something.  I think I may season the chicken a bit more next time and see if that helps.  Very nice dish!

This was so simple and NICE! I cooked this for my husband and he loved it! I added a little bit bacon bits before serving which add the crunchiness.

Pretty good. I think it needs additional seasonings. A little bland. I even added some extra seasonings and used garlic/olive oil seasoned tomatoes. Good base to work with.  First few bites kind of bland. Liked better, the more we ate.  9 yr old liked it.  I also added diced bell peppers.

As written, this dish has waaaay too much oil, and coupled with the cream, it's pretty terrible for you. BUT with a few changes, this can be really tasty and actually nutritious.  I only used about 1 Tbsp of olive oil, also added 1/2 cup of chopped sweet onion and subbed a can of fire roasted tomatoes for the tomato puree.  I also used a cup of 2% evaporated milk instead of cream, used whole grain pasta (about 10 oz) and sprinkled with a little reduced fat parmesan and some red pepper flakes.  It turned out awesome... and without all the excess fat and calories.

I tried to incorporate the other recommendations and it turned out great! Used less than 1/4 cup oil, substituted 1/2 cup low fat sour cream instead of the heavy cream, and added a dash of lemon juice.  I also used 2/3 lb whole wheat penne and had grated paramesan on the table.

I followed the recipe exactly and I found it pretty bland as a whole. I would try it with a splash of white wine or... something! The asparagus flavour with the sauce was really good though!

Very simple meatless meal that is a breeze to whip up. Good base for whatever you want to add to spice it up. Else, a good simple weeknight dinner.

I know everyone hates when you change the recipe, but hubby and I are having a compeition to see if we can lose 10 pounds in a month.  That being said we cut way down on the olive oil and cut out the heavy cream.  Use two cans of diced tomatoes (blended because we like pasta saucy).  I also had some fresh basil in the fridge that I tossed in along with red pepper flakes and viola - a nice healthy meal.  Oh, we topped with some fresh parm cheese (we're are not perfect!).  Thanks for sharing!

As others I didn't use as much olive oil, just enough to saute the garlic and one small chopped onion. Thought maybe the cooking time would be too long for the asparagus, but it wasn't and probably contributed to the nice flavor. I used half and half for the cream. Was a very good side dish with Sizzling Sherry Garlic Shrimp also on this site.

A great quick and hearty evening meal!  My modest changes include adding some porcini mushrooms and a splash of vodka along with the cream to kick up the sauce a bit, but the original recipe is wonderful by itself.

Not sure why the others said it was bland, I didn't think so.  I thought it had a very nice flavor and loved the taste of the asparagus.  I pretty much kept to the recipe but did make some small changes.  Used garlic salt for salt, used a can of diced tomatoes(I mashed them up) for the pureed tomatoes, used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2(we love garlic), and added a tsp of minced onions.  At the end I added some parm cheese on top.

I tried this recipe last night with a twist: I added scallops and dried basil, reduced the oil and replaced heavy cream with light cream...The kids called it the best pasta they ever tasted!

I altered the recipe and it was amazing and better than any restaurant 'pink sauce.'  I sauted shallots with garlic, and used reduced fat sour cream instead of cream (thanks to the other reviewer for that suggestion) and then added 1/2 tub of crumbled gorgonzola.  Amazing!  Next time I will make this sauce for gnocchi.

Awesome recipe! I tweaked it a little. There was a reco to replace the heavy cream, so I used soy milk and nutritional yeast flakes (made it vegan-friendly). I also used fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned ones and added fresh basil. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

I really enjoyed this. I did change it a little. I didn't have mushrooms. I used chopped garlic with a whole bunch of asparagus which I sauted with a bit of butter and olive oil and seasoned with some salt and pepper. Then I put one can of diced garlic basil tomatoes (which I didn't drain)and simmered until most of the liquid had evaporated. I then eyed the amount of cream (only like a couple of tablespoons) to give it that rosy hue. I mixed the cooked mini penne I had with the sauce and then sprinkled some grated romano on top before serving. It was amazing. Even my two year old liked it!

My husband and I made this based on the other reviews (it had 4 1/2 stars when we made it on 12/19/07) and this was definitely an emperor with no clothes!!!
As with all recipes off this website, we made it first time through with no modifications to the original recipe; the result was bland and gluey.

We use this as a copy cat pasta albufera from Caroll Street Cafe in Atlanta. Sooo good and very similar. We do add chili paste (but we add that to pretty much everything) we make this at least once a week. So simple.

Way too bland. Made it according to the recipe.   Have to find a way to spice up the leftovers.

Fixed this for dinner this week, the only thing I did different was to add red peppers along with the mushrooms because I had some in the house and needed to use them up and I used fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream.  This was really good and easy!  Probably would have been thicker with the cream, but still really good with the fat free half and half.  Would be good with different combinations of vegetables too, will make again!

This recipe was bland and needs more spice.  After adding lots of salt to my plate, I enjoyed it fine, but I wouldn't be excited to make it again.  My substitutions:  I used 2/3 cup olive oil, whole wheat pasta, 1 cup half and half.

I really liked this recipe. I try to have a meatless meal at least once a week and this was perfect. Only change I would make is to use half butter half olive oil. Don't get me wrong, I love my olive oil but, when eating the leftovers they were a little bland. I think adding the butter would help. I will make this recipe again.

I improvised on this and it was great! I added red bell pepper and used tomato paste and chicken broth since I didn't have canned tomatoes. To cut down on the fat, I used less oil, and added light sour cream, skim milk, and a little heavy cream. Very easy to lighten this up!

I loved this recipe, but did make it much healthier.  I sauteed the garlic in a pan sprayed with non stick spray, then added the mushrooms and asparagus with a couple tablespoons of oil, not the half cup called for.  In place of the whipping cream, I used a half cup low fat sour cream.  It was delicious, and healthy and even the kids liked it.

This recipe was great and I made some alterations.  I used whole wheat penne pasta and a bottle of alfredo sauce in place of the cream.  I also cut the olive oil to about 2 tablespoons.  It was just perfect!

What's not to love about this recipe?  I took other reviewers advice and reduced the amount of olive oil, and served it with grilled chicken breast-delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband is the type of man that thinks that if there is no meat in it, it ain't worth eating.  I made this dish and he loved it.  My whole family loved it.  A family keeper.

I loved this recipe as is.  I have prepared this dish three times and am looking forward to having it for dinner again tonight.
