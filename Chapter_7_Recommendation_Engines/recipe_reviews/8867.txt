Did most of the 'tweaking' as suggested by others.  This recipe is kind of like a template for you to build off of.  I added a couple cloves of crushed garlic, s&p,  Parm cheese, a dash of dried green onions, and used cream of mushroom soup(it's what I had).  Loved the end result.

For a quick, easy meal this is excellent.  I didn't think it would be as good as it was with the small list of ingredients!  I added garlic and season salt and parmesean cheese on top.  A winner with my family, thanks.

I had 1/2 container left-over store-bought spinach dip, was looking for a recipe to use it up, and found a winner with this one! I followed some of others' suggestions: Mixed 1/2 tsp. minced garlic with Healthy Reqst. cream of mushroom soup (instead of cream of chix) and put them in a blender with the white wine.  Then I lightly sprinkled seasoned salt, poultry seasoning, and pepper on chix breasts (only used seasoned salt on one side vs. both sides) and tenderized the chix breasts with a Jaccard tenderizer (has 10 little knives in it).  I poured a little of the soup mixture in the bottom of the casserole dish and sprinkled 1/4 cup diced onions on the soup.  Then I placed the chix breasts in the dish, poured the remaining soup mixture on top, and sprinkled 1/4 cup diced onions on top.  Baked it for 1/2 hr., took it out of the oven, spooned the spinach dip on top, and baked it for another 1/2 hr.  It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful -- it's definitely a "company" dish!  It IS a little soupy, but worked well with the linguine I served.  A definite keeper!

I hate to bash the ideas of others, but I made this last night, and I found it to be really gross.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it basically tasted like cream of chicken soup gone wrong.  I couldn't finish eating it.  I would not recommend this recipe.

We all enjoyed this very well!  I didn't have wine on hand, so I used New Castle beer and it was wonderful!  I also took some suggestions i read and added 1/2 bag frozen spinach(thawed and drained), 3 tblsp Parm. cheese, 1 clove garlic, 2 tsp oregano and a little pepper.  Couldn't have been better!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

easy to make. substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken. added pepper, garlic, basil and oregano. Cooked the recipe in the electric pressure cooker with 5 chicken breasts. I easily could have used 6 breasts. There was lots of sauce left over. I thickened it with a little with flour after removing the chicken. served it with rice, but would have went much better with pasta.

Perfect. So simple and with a few spices as suggested by other reviewers - Papirka, garlic powder & parmesan cheese. It was a hit.

so simple and tastes great. I used cream of chicken w/herbs. I think maybe the sauce could be thinned a little (more wine?..lol)I also thought adding artichokes may taste good. Haven't tried that yet. Definitely will make again

This was a great starter recipe but i added oregano, oregano, chives, black olives and corn. It turned out great1 I served it with penne pasta with grape tomatoes on the side. I also used low fat, low sodium cream of mushroom soup.

Really enjoyed this meal.  I changed the recipe a lot after reading other reviews.  I chopped 2 large chicken breasts into large bite size pieces.  I sauteed mushrooms and a small red onion in a little olive oil with 1 clove of crushed garlic then added the chicken and about 3 rashers of chopped smokey bacon.  Once lightly cooked i placed these ingredients to one side in an oven dish i then deglazed the pan with white wine, reduced the wine then mixed together a can of batchelor's low fat condensed mushroom soup and about 2 large spoons of sour cream to a smooth consistency then whisked it into the wine brought it to high heat then pored the sauce over the chicken, mushroom, onion and bacon added lots of fresh ground pepper and baked it in the oven for about 30 to 40 minutes then served it over pasta.  The sauce was lovely thick and creamy and the smokey bacon added a wonderful flavour.

This was a good spin on the traditional cream of chicken over chicken but wasn't spectacular. A good pantry dinner, but not my favorite. The sauce was good, a little watery. I would try to dress it up next time.

I had no white wine on hand or apple juice (which is my usual substitute for white wine) so I got creative and mixed in pineapple juice. I think it added a bit of a tangy flavor but not very noticeable. All in all it was a recipe which made good leftovers. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.

Such a quick easy recipe that even picky husband enjoyed. I only gave this four stars because I added minced garlic and a diced onion to the mix which I think made this recipe perfect. It came in handy because I had some white wine left over I didn't want to drink. I will be making this many times again.

Wow! This was great. I too altered the recipe. I had cream of chicken with herbs (and I added onion powder, garlic, oregano, pepper and a pinch of salt). I thought I had enough sour cream, but came up 1/2 cup short. I replaced with milk. It was delicious. However, I think that the entire amount of sour cream (as the recipe calls for)  would be better! I will make this recipe again, and again and again!

I also tweaked this but still found it a bit bland.  I added a small can mushrooms, 1/2 cup or so of chopped green onions and 3 cloves minced garlic but still found it lacking.  I'm putting itin the fridge for leftover lunch tomorrow and hoping that it will get better as it sits :(

I've made this a couple times now, and it's one of my husband's favorites.  I usually add some spices (garlic powder, onion powder, paprika).  This time I added a slice of provolone cheese and a slice of tavern ham to the chicken before I slathered on the sauce.  YUM!

My husband and I LOVED this! I added basil, oregano, paprika, parmesan cheese, and garlic powder to the mixture. I also seasoned the chicken with season salt and pepper before putting the mixture on top. This was delicious and easy! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for 6 and did alot of tweaking to the recipe. I wound up doubling the wine, using 2 full cans of the soup, cutting up a can of artichoke hearts, adding garlic, shredded parmesan cheese (1/3 C?), scallions and seasoned the chicken first. I served it over pasta and had plenty of "gravy". Not bad, everyone ate it and some had seconds, but I feel like it's still missing something to make it WOW...but what?

Like others said, this is a good base recipe. I added garlic, s/p and one cup of white wine. The flavor was very good in the gravy. I made noodles to serve on the side with the gravy.

This is so good, definitely one of my favorite quick weeknight recipes when I'm craving comfort food! I use 98% fat free soup and fat free sour cream to make it a little healthier.

A'right. The taste was pretty bland, but a good idea if you have some sour cream and chicken you want to use up!

needs doctoring, but then it is very good. seaseoned the chicken with pepper, garlic salt, garlic powder, mccormick perfect pinch chicken seasoning, onion powder and rosemary. browned in a pan (didn't cook through). added same seasoning above to the sauce as well as some paprika. added mushrooms over the chicken before pouring on the sauce. baked for an hour. served with sour cream mashed potato (had a lot of sour cream to use up) and mixed veg. lovely. will make it again!

This was SO delicious!  I browned the chicken on the stove in a little oil first, and used cream of chicken with herbs (I bought the wrong stuff) and of course added salt and pepper.  I cooked it in the oven for a really long time, because we had friends over and got distracted and it came out so tender and thick...had it with mashed potatoes and everyone loved it!!  Can't wait to make it again!!!

This dish is so easy to make and is very tasty.  It taste just fine following the recipe but if there are other spices that you like, you can add them to personalize the dish.  I recommend this dish to people who don't normally cook but are wanting to try something different.

I hate when someone rates a recipe and then makes incredible changes to it, but most every reviewer made changes so I will also.

Fantastic! ...Except I made some major changes...on a recipe with three ingredients. Here goes: No wine whatsoever; cream of mushroom; garlic powder, black pepper, and oregano. Holy , it was delicious! There was LOTS of extra sauce. That sauce was fantastic!

We've been making this one for years. we like to serve it over buttered egg noodles. Try it with cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Also try adding the sour cream mixture about halfway into the baking.  Yum!

I subsititued vinegar for white wine and added some drained marinated artichoke hearts.  It was pretty good.  Serves well with rice or noodles because there is plenty of sauce on the chicken.

This is a great recipe. For more flavor I added a can of cream of mushroom soup (w/roasted garlic. I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces and put it on top of angel hair pasta. My husband loves it every time and it is very easy to make.

Good with rice, added garlic salt and parm cheese to it.  Wasn't soupy like others stated.  It's a good go-to meal, because it's easy and tastes decent.  Definitely nothing I would be craving and HAD to have.

I only had 3 chicken breast, so this turned out soupy for me. The chicken had good flavor, though, so I think with a few tweaks it will be good. I'll try some of the other suggestions and make sure I have enough chicken next time!

I used the basic recipe using light sour cream and the healthy version of Campbell's condensed cream of chicken to cut some of the fat and calories. I then added a tsp of black pepper, red pepper flakes, and a healthy pinch of a dried cilantro/jalapeno dip, and grated parmesan. It really spices up the rich creaminess and made for a quick, tasty, and filling dinner. My sauce tended to be more of an alfredo sauce-like consistency, not runny at all as some reviewers indicated theirs was. Gave the recipe to 3 others at work and they all loved it too. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good dish, I did like some others and added seasoned salt &pepper, garlic powder, a spice called "slap your mama" (cayenne like), and put some salad shrimp on the chicken. Poured the soup mixture over chicken and baked. Served over angle hair pasta. The chicken got a little dry but was a great hit and requested again by my family.

I was a little nervous while making this but the results were AWESOME!  I let it set after taking it out of the oven for about 5 mins and the sauce set just enough that it was not as soupy.  We will most def. have this again.

Wow - My 12 year old son's exact words "AMAZING"  and he's tough to please.  I added the sour cream,garlic & parm. cheese. Wonderful - prep. time so fast - just whip it together and into the oven. I served with fresh steamed brocolli -  and even used the sauce from chicken/as like gravy over the brocolli- presents beautifully. Will Definately make this one again- it's a recipe keeper !

This is a good base recipe to then add the seasoning/extras that you want.  I added a heaping tsp of crushed garlic, 1 tblsp of locatelli cheese, and some pepper and it came out tasting great.  I think next time I might try using 3/4 cup sour cream instead of one full cup.  I used the low-fat cream of mushroom soup and it was great!

I built off of all the suggestions in the reviews and we really liked this recipe. My main problem was my husband was late and I let the chicken overcook! I added garlic, onion, basil and s&p. The main thing to remember with this dish is: If you don't like the wine you use, you're not going to like the dish. I use white zinfendel. It turned out great!

Excellent recipe, although next time I will use a dry white wine instead of a semi-sweet. I followed the advice of some of the other comments- I added garlic, a little oregano, and I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken, and it came out pretty tasty! Thanks!

The basic recipe seemed boring so I took the advice of others.  I used cream of mushroom soup, I added in 1 tbs minced garlic, 1/2 chopped onion, and 1 pkg (10oz) frozen spinach, thawed and drained.  Came out YUMMY!

We enjoyed this recipe.  It made a great sauce for our rice.  We did spice it up with some basil and thyme and it turned out wonderful.  We would definitely try this again and agree that it's like a template for other dishes.

Very yummy, and an excellent base for other recipes I will use. I added diced fresh garlic and parmesan as suggested. Didn't have white wine, substituted 1/4 c dry sherry and some chicken broth. Tasted fine with fat free sour cream and Healthy Request cream of chicken. Very simple and not much mess!

This was very easy to make. We don't drink, so I did not include the wine. I added some Parmesean cheese and noodles, but I felt the dish needed a kick. I am going to add Rotel next time I make it.

Took a couple of suggestions - garlic powder, paprika, parm cheese, artichoke hearts, and salt & pepper - Turned out to be a wonderful meal!

This is so incredibly easy and tasty. Great for a weeknight meal. I used light sour cream, cream of chicken and mushroom, and sherry (out of white wine). I also, seasoned both the sauce and the chicken. Added poultry seasoning, onion and garlic powder, black pepper and garlic salt. Served with rice and poured the sauce over it...husband loved it.

Wonderful!  I seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt, a little garlic, and Ms. Dash.  I left out the wine, and used 2 cans of mushroom soup.  I didn't have any cream of chicken.  It turned out wonderful still.  I served it with white rice, and the poured the gravy over the rice.  Everyone loved it...I'll be making this again...and I'll be getting some cream of chicken soup for next time.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was pretty good! I wouldnt say it was the best in the world but its a good, fast and easy meal. I noticed the cream sauce was really bland with just those few ingredients so i added in a few things. I sprinkled in some Adobo, minced up some fresh garlic, a little bit of onion powder and paprika. The family enjoyed it and Id make it again.

I thought this receipe was really good.  There was a lot of sauce and it was nice and creamy, there was no really strong flavour, but there was nothing wrong with that.  I think it needed a bit of crunch though so I added toasted almonds to the top.

I make this regularly but have made changes like everyone else. This seems really to be a basis to start from. I cut the sour cream in half as I felt it overpowered the cream of chicken. I also don't cook it with the wine but that is for health reasons. As for spices, I went heavy on the spices. I used Brewpub Chicken Seasoning, black pepper,  garlic and paprika but certainly this is something you should change to your own taste. Whatever smells good to you. Keep in mind that it's creamy so go a little heavier than normal on the spices.

Even with a good recipe, I am a horrible cook.  I decided to try this because it was easy. Noticed a lot of the suggestions. Took in mind that it needed tweeked.  I started with the base. I don't like herbs so that was out. I checked for leftover ingredients in fridge. Added 1/2 cup of wine to thin the sauce more to put over pasta. I had leftover blue cheese crumbles and put approx 1/2 cup in. I think that might have been too much so probably 1/4 would be better. Salt and pepper along with diced white onion.  Added 1 clove of minced garlic.  I was pressed for time so browned in skillet and then put in oven. Loved it. Thanks so much. Still a bad cook but feeling better about it now.

I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper. I didn't have any white wine, so I replaced it with 1/3 cup of apple juice and 1/2 tbsp of white wine vinegar   I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp paprika, and about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar to the sauce. I mixed these well and poured over the chicken before baking. THIS WAS AWESOME!! I think the flavor was about the best I've gotten from a baked chicken dish.  It was best served warm, as opposed to reheating the leftovers, as the sauce tended to separate.

I didn't have a canned soup so I used a cup of heavy whipping cream and a boullion cube instead.  I also added in powdered garlic, seasoning salt, and parmesean cheese.  Mine was done after about 45 minutes, then I took the chicken out and thicked the sauce with a little flour and whipping cream.  Delicious! The chicken was very juicy as well.

I love this recipe. I actually make it in the slow cooker, so the chicken gets really tender. I also add a generous amount of dill (2-3T) for flavor, otherwise it's too bland. I serve it over rice with some veggies on the side. If you don't have sour cream or you want to cut the fat, plain yogurt works equally well as a substitute.

We really enjoyed this!  I cooked as directly, only using cream of mushroom instead.  I also added a can of mushrooms.  We loved it.  Very tender and so flavorful.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  Gravy was delicious on top of the potatoes.  Thanks for sharing!

Really liked this. The wine flavor was a bit too present for me so might try half broth and half wine next time. Did add fresh garlic and a little salt and cracked pepper just for extra seasoning. The sauce was the perfect consistency; not too thick like gravy but not watery either. Excellent over rice ***** Sauce was even better two days later when we chopped up the left over chicken, added it along with some frozen peas to the sauce, reheated and served over rice. Yummy!

Yum!  A great way to use up leftover sour cream.  I used Low-fat Cream of Mushroom instead of Cream of Chicken.  I liked it as is but it would be great with some garlic, green onion, etc. as suggested by others.

I made this last night and it was great, The presentation left a little to be desired, but the chicken was AMAZING, it was so tender, my 13 year old said it smelled and tasted great, event my 2 year old finished his plate. My favorite part is it took like 6 minutes to get in the oven and 45 minutes to cook!

I also added some little extras. I felt like it was missing "something" but couldn't quite put my finger on it. I will definately make it again and keep tweeking it until I get it right.

Thanx to whoever left this recipe, it was a hit!!! My husband was very impressed and pleased. He totally thought this was restaurant quality.  I did tweak the recipe as well adding: 1 clove of fresh garlic (minced), a couple shakes of chicken boullion, 2 tbsp oregano, 3 tbsp parmesean cheese, and I used cream of celery instead which really highlighted the flavor of the wine perfectly.

This was fabulous!!  I made the changes suggested by some and my husband loved it!  I served it with potatoes instead of rice which was okay.

A recipe like this has been around in my family for a while. A few substitutions...instead of wine use sherry and also add a can of button mushrooms. Serve with rice and broccoli. The kids love this.

I sliced yellow cooking onions and placed a layer of them over the chicken before pouring the sauce over them. The suace I made was Cup of Sour Cream, Can of C of Chx soup, and 1/4 cup white cooking wine, and about 1 tbsp of Tastefully Simple's "Garlic, Garlic" It had a distinct sour cream flavor, and the garlic really was perfect. The sauce makes for a great gravy on some potatoes.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I jazzed it up with garlic salt, crushed garlic, thyme and parmasean cheese. Before I put the chicken in the oven I made sure to spinkle the breat with salt and pepper to make it even more flavorful. My family loved it!! Definetly a good basic recipe- you can do alot with it!

I made this for my little brother and hubby. Both love all things chicken. This was a big hit. I used chicken broth instead of wine because we don't drink. Turned out moist and tender. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I seasoned the tenders with salt and pepper before pouring the sour cream mixture on top. I grated some fresh parmesan on top as soon as they came out of the oven. They were very moist, juicy and absolutely fabulous! I will definitely make this again!

I did some 'tweaking' as suggested by others. This recipe is kind of like a template for you to build off of. I added lemon juice, onions and Parm cheese on the top. Family really liked it. Will make again.

Like all the other reviewers, I added a few of my own ingredients to this recipe.  I layered the bottom of the dish with fresh broccoli pieces. I also mixed about 4 tablespoons of fresh pico de gallo style salsa in with the mixture (I used cream of mushroom). Then I spooned 1 more tablespoon of salsa on top of each breast before baking. The end result added a little more flavor than the original recipe. *I also used low fat ingredients (soup, cheese, sour cream) and still found it to be fantastic! A little thin, but thickens while standing.

This is a good base to a recipe. I made a few alterations. I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and browned them in olive oil (2Tbs.) and butter (1 Tbs.). Then I removed the chicken from the (oven proof) pan. I deglazed the pan with the white wine and added 1/2 an onion diced. After the onions had a chance to cook thru I added a Tbs. garlic minced. Then I stired in 2 cups sliced mushrooms, the soup and the sour cream. I added some chicken stock to thin out the sauce. I added the chicken back in to the pan and topped it all with a cup grated parmesean cheese. I baked the chicken as directed but mine were done in 45 mins. (due to the size, and the browning). Served it all over egg noodles for me, and rice for my husband. Both were great. (I cooked the rice in wine and stock). A simple salad on the side and it was a very filling meal, with a lot of leftovers.

Tasted surprisingly good. I served it over the white minute rice. I also added about a Tbsp of crushed garlic, and salt n pepper. The cheese sounded good so I shredded some parm. and some asiago over the top and baked as it says. My 2 year old son loved it as well

If you make this just like the recipe states, to me it tastes like sour milk. I added a lot of the modifications people suggested in the comments - garlic, Italian seasonings, Parmesan cheese, cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. That helped some, but I still don't plan on making this recipe ever again.

Good flavor but not great.  It would have made a good sauce over rice but it was too thick and not enough.

Our family loved this one!  I seasoned the chicken with Adobe seasoning mix before adding the other ingredients.  I served it with rice the first time, and over egg noodles for leftovers.  We will have this again!

Okay, I don't know what happened, but this turned out so terribly. We followed the recipe to the letter, and it smelled amazing while it was baking, but it tasted awful. It smelled so good that we might give it another try, though.

Tasty! I lighten it up a bit by using low fat soup and sour cream. I added 2 pressed cloves of garlic and a pinch of smoked paprika. I cubed the chicken and served it over broccoli and spaghetti squash for a lower carb alternative to pasta or rice. Next time I'll try some brown and wild rice pilaf with it! Yum!

I made this last night, and it was really yummy! Very easy and quick. I didn't have chiekn breasts, so I used thighs. I had a little Havarty cheese, so I grated that I sprinkled it on the top (about 1 cup). Next time I might add a little onion, and maybe some garlic. All in all, quite good!

I forgot to mention, that I followed it exactly.  I think the cream of mushroom soup would have been too mushroomy for *us*, but for those who like mushrooms more, that would probably be delicious too.  We like them a little though, so I did add a 4 oz. can of mushrooms, and it added a nice texture.

This is one of my favorite fall-back recipes to do when I don't know what to do for dinner.  My hubby and I both love it; the tanginess of the wine and sour cream go great over white basmatti rice.  I do alter it slightly and use cream of mushroom chicken, tho', and add a little garlic and of course, salt and lots of ground pepper. Sorry to hear someone actually hated it!  Wow, maybe she should try it w/ the cream of mushroom soup version, then it wouldn't taste so chickeny.
