Very simple to make. The first night I thought it was a little bland so I would have only rated it with three stars. Luckily I had the left overs for lunch the next day. What a differnce that made! The sausage flavor had time to really blend with the gravy to make a wonderful meal. Next time I will simmer the gravy longer before serving to give it the extra flavor it really needs.

This is your basic sausage gravy.  After trying several recipes from this site, our favorite gravy recipe is the "Country Sausage Gravy".  It is loaded with flavor!!  I did add garlic and onion powder, as well as a bit of dried herb seasoning.

This is really good, but SO much better if it has the chance to sit overnight. When it's first done the flour is very easy to taste, but the next day all of the flavors have blended nicely.

Yep, this is it! I never had this growing up - this is something I learned about after meeting my (Texan) in-laws... and I was an instant fan. I giggled when I read the "you can add some sausage back in" instructions because I always make this with at LEAST half a pound of sausage in the gravy. Chunky is better! I know some recipes call for sage sausage, and even though I have a love affair with maple sausage, I wouldn't use anything but plain for gravy. Just too darn good to mess around with it! If you're looking for a biscuit recipe to go with, try Mom's Baking Powder Biscuits here. Not fancy, just delicious and easy. Enjoy!

I did the bacon version after cooking some bacon....it turned out great! The bits from the pan made it color up really nice.  I put cayenne pepper in with the roux, I think it helps with the flour taste.  I've also heard that cooking the roux for at least the five minutes is important to not get the flour taste.  Probably why grandma burnt hers a bit on purpose!

I am new to cooking and this was very simple to fix. It was fantastic. I mixed the crumbled sausage in with the gravy.

I had never made this before because I thought it would be too complicated, however, it was so easy to make.  My husband liked it a lot.  I added some cayenne pepper to make it a little spicy.

This is a very good simple recipe, but seasoning is wholly dependent on sausage used, which is fine, just make sure the stuff you use is good or it may be a bit blend. Always use local meat shop breakfast sausage and it comes out very good.

I tasted this while cooking and thought it needed at least a little extra seasoning...I added freshly ground black pepper and some dried crumbled sage.  Skipped a step to make this even easier and just drained the grease off the sausage, leaving about 1 tblsp in the skillet.  Then sprinkled a good heaping tblsp of flour over the meat and combined well, cooking for a minute or so.  Then added the milk (didn't measure, just kept adding until the thickness was right.) Served this over thick slices of buttered french bread that I toasted under the broiler.

Oh wow.......incredible! I used Jimmy Dean sage bulk sausage which was really flavorful.  I used quite a bit more flour than suggested and it came out just perfect. The simplicity of this recipe is down home, authentic and needs no bells or whistles. Sunny side up eggs went very nicely with with this biscuits and gravy dinner which my family absolutely adored Denyse. Thank you!

One of the best simple sausage gravies I had and very easy to make.  Instead of putting sausage to the side, I poured the prepared gravy over the sausage to place on my hot biscuits in the morning  :)

Easy to make, I used a pound of our "home-grown" sausage we put up last month (because it was not too fatty I had to add a tablespoon of vegetable shortening to the roux) - I heated my milk in the microwave so that it was hot when I poured it into the roux.  I added very little salt and about a 1/4 tsp of freshly ground pepper.  It was very good.  I imagine it would be even better if left to sit overnight for the flavors to blend.

We used Lamb Sausage (rather than pork) for this. Had to play around with the flour/milk ratio to get the right texture but overall it was excellent.

This is best when you use Jimmy Dean Hot sausage and add cayenne pepper to the gravy...but I like my food spicy!  I add the sausage back to the pan after the gravy starts to thicken. SO GOOD!

AWESOME with biscuits!  I didn't think I'd ever be able to get the real NC mountain taste of biscuits and gravy- but this sure hit the spot!  I added salt to taste and cayenne for a little kick.  It tasted like home :)

Really easy to make & so tasty.  I added a pinch of pepper & some salt to add flavor.  The sausage added a lot of flavoring too.  I had rave reviews on this gravy & have shared it with friends.

This is a very good, simple recipe, especially if you want to get food on the table in 15 minutes or less.  I am a vegetarian so I changed the recipe as follows:  I used a soy "meatless sausage" instead of real sausage, and when it did not produce enough grease to make the gravy, I simply added 2 TBS of olive oil to the pan and proceeded with the recipe as it is written.  When finished, I poured the "sausage" gravy over biscuits, and it was wonderful.

For more favor try cooking the gravy in the pan with the sauage. This is a great base to start with. I break up my sauage into small pieces, cook in a 2 qt. sauce pan stirring often. When it gets a little brown I add a tablespoon of butter and my flour. Cook this, stirring constantly. Once it starts to get brown I add my milk, stir until it is thickened the way I want it. If your gravy gets too thick, add a little more milk or water to thin it. Just remember a sauce or gray made with flour will continue to thicken after you quit cooking it.

Wonderfuly Gravy recipe! My husband is very set on what he wants for breakfast on the weekends. He was a little leary when i told him that i wanted to make biscuits & sausage gravy instead...He loved it so much, he has now requested to have it every weekend :) New family favorite! Thanks for the new recipe!

Good basic recipe, but needs assistance of at least salt and pepper to bring out the sausage flavor and slightly suppress the flour flavor.  Found that the recipe does not seem to scale well, or the original yield of 12 servings is far off.  Tried to scale to 1/2 size (6 servings), and barely had enough for two biscuits.

Great recipe - the only way to make sausage gravy.  If you like spicy, add a can of well-drained RoTel tomatoes after it's had time to simmer for a bit.  Yum!

This is a great base recipe that I will use often!  I made sausage links and didn't have quite enough grease so added a little butter.  Added salt and pepper at the end and it was delicious!  I'm getting ready to make it again using bacon this time.

To be honest, gravy has never been one of those things I could do... until this recipe.  Amazing!  I do agree that pepper is required, though.

I made this for my husband's birthday breakfast.  First time at ever making "biscuits and gravy" and I have to admit, I had to do some research because I couldn't understand the whole concept of a biscuit with just gravy on it.  But I made it because my husband loves this breakfast.  He thought it was very, very good.  Five stars!  I did crumble some sausage in with it and added some pepper.  He loved it.

This is the recipe I use and it is very good.  You need to season to taste with salt and pepper I also use accent and that really brings out the flavor.  Good hearty breakfast or for any meal.

My family loves this recipe. I use turkey sausage instead of pork so there's very little grease in the pan, so i used butter. it still came out delicious.

Good basic idea, though I did make a small addition. I sauted some yellow onion in the "fat" before making my roux. I also added black pepper as a reviewer before me suggested. All in all, very yummy! Great on mashed potatoes :)

Good recipe and tasty results. We make sure to use the same pan that we fried the sausage in and each batch is different on how much flour and how much milk. For us, it is a must to use black pepper also. You can also use bacon/bacon grease as well. This is good country cooking. Thanks.

We all loved it!! I added 2 more TB of flour, used all 3 cups of milk at once, and added a few shakes of seasoned salt.  I let it simmer a while until it was as thick as I liked it and flavorful.  Simple and delicious!! :)

You do not need to drain and remove the sausage.  Just leave the sausage and all the grease in the pan, add more flour, enough that it soaks up most of the grease, then add the milk.

This recipe seemed incomplete and bland. I couldn’t put my finger on what was wrong. There was no flavor really to speak of when following recipe as published. Added salt; nothing. Added more salt; still nothing. Added pepper and more pepper; still not the desired taste I am used to with sausage gravy. I then added sage to taste. That did the trick! Add sage. It will change the entire flavor of the recipe for the better!!!!!

This would be a perfect basic sausage gravy recipe if salt and pepper was listed in the ingredients.  Had to give 4 stars for that.  Would be great with other additions too, onions, garlic, or even some fresh grated nutmeg, which is perfect in gravies :)

This is a good basic gravy. I didn't have sausage available so I used bacon as a substitute and added black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder to bring out more flavor. If you're cooking with bacon or prepackaged sausage I would skip adding salt.

The gravy pretty bland but I didn't want to make it again so I started adding salt and pepper. That just added a little bit of flavor so (this may sound weird) I added a little bit of mozzarella cheese and butter to it. That made it taste pretty good so I kept adding salt and pepper and it tasted pretty good when it was done.

My mom taught me basically the same recipe. 3tbsp flour to 3 cups milk. Makes a skillet that has plenty of gravy for a family for 4-6, that are extra gravy on top people sausage usually renders the perfect amount of fat in the skillet for this recipe also. Bacon usually renders too much, so some will need to be scooped out (no problem). Both greases give good flavor to the gravy. When I measure out my flour I add about 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/8 tsp garlic powder & 1/8 tsp onion powder. All those spices are to your families preference. Leaving out or increasing to taste. A good "all season" mix such as Tex-joy is good (but I'm a control freak so I add my own). Remember, you can also salt & pepper on your plate. And I taste as in cooking and adjust seasoning.

I had never made this before and it was pretty good. I think I could make it great by using a more flavorful sausage. I'll definitely be making it again!

Don't need to try!  Been making it about the same for 40 years.  I now add part like maybe 1/4 water then 3/4 milk.  I cover the meat and just a little higher with the liquid.  I use 2 heaping tablespoons flour per lb of sausage.  I always add all the meat in to the gravy.  This is sooooo good!  Today I add some red pepper flakes to it.  My mother in law told me if you like it dark in color to just add a 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee.  That does work but I never cared if it was dark or not.  Its fabulous just on toast.  Been great for 40 years and many many people beg me to bring it to camp.  Its a hit.

Basic sausage gravy. Definitely make sure you cook the roux 5 minutes or more. I didn't use all the milk. It turned out fine. I used mild breakfast sausage. After tasting I added some black pepper, onion powder and hot pepper sauce. We served over toast, and it was good.

It's all about the roux people! Take your time and do it right (like gumbo, the roux should be the color of am old penny) amd you don't need amything else, not even a pinch of salt.

I love this recipe! Only i didn't read it well the first time I made it. I threw ALL of the sausage in the gravy. I served it to my husband and a few friends and was thrilled to hear they loved it! They said it was better then any restaurant they had ever eaten it at! "All that sausage!!!! " was the response.  they said the restaurants never put enough sausage in it!

Simple, yet lovely. I added a bit of hot sauce to bring some heat to it. I've done it both ways. If I use spicy sausage, then I don't. One time I made the mistake of using one of those really hot sauces, called Brand New A**hole... and ya, they call it that for a reason!! LOL I killed that poor gravy in a very quick death!!

I did the bacon version and it wasn't that great. I think the sausage would be much better. I think it was just my personal preference, but I felt like I was eating bacon grease (I was). It definitely needs salt and pepper.

Basically followed this recipe to a T, except instead of draining the fat I kept allof it to use as a roux. I added quite a bit of black pepper and about 1/4tsp of salt. It was great. I had enough to have leftovers the next day and it was even better.

loved it! i was making in smaller portions for the two of us so i  used a couple of chopped links for each of us(bought in bulk then portioned and put in freezer). i added a bit of butter to sausage fat to stretch it a bit and a touch of pepper to it as it thickened.  i thought it was the perfect breakfast with Nancy Horsburg's Fluffy Biscuit recipe and a fried egg.  :o) (I made the gravy once with maple sausage and boyfriend preferred it, though i thought it was odd.)

5 stars for ease, 3 for taste.
Given this was my first attempt at homemade Biscuits & Gravy, I thought it was super easyto make.  Flavor wise, it was kind of bland at first even though I did let it simmer while I made the biscuits so it would have time to marry all the flavors, but it was still a bit bland for my taste though my husband said it was great.  The left overs the next day though were awesome.  I might try cooking it the day before and then reheating and see what kind of results I get then.

This is a very good basic gravy! I added salt and pepper to taste and used crumbled roasted bell pepper and caramelized onion sausage in it! Delicious!

It was very good. I didnt have enough fat from my sausage so I added some shortening. It worked great. We had a lovely Christmas morning. Thanks.

This was really simple. I used bacon and served over toast.  I recommend adding the cooked meat to the gravy.  Thanks! :-)
