these were really good. But I was not sure if the meat should be cooked before adding, so I cooked the meat before adding the egg and bread crumbs to be on the safe side. My kids liked them esp since they could eat them with their hands. I was a little impatient waiting to flip them becasue I was in a hurry, so I put them in the oven until I was done cooking them all to make sure they cooked thru. I will be making these again. I think I will try usung sausage and them freezing them. They would be great to reheat for a quick breakfast on the go.

I've never had potato pancakes before and I have to say I loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, using some cayenne pepper in the potato mixture and Italian bread crumbs in the ground beef. These came out so delicious! As I was frying it, the thought hit me that I could have added some shredded cheese on top the ground beef. I ended up serving these with a generous grating of cheddar cheese on top, with ketchup and hot sauce as a dip. I initially started off eating these with a fork but soon realized I could eat them like a burger! These would make a different but good lunch for kids to carry to school. Maybe by adding the cheese in the middle and seasoning the meat mixture with BBQ sauce to eliminate the need for any dip. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Thanks for the reviews! Adding cheese sounds really good, dont know why I havent thought of it! Also I posted this as a very basic recipe, I dont like posting complex recipes because everyone has their own taste and others may not like what I do. This is just an idea, I encourage you to add your own herbs and spices, and whatever else sounds good to you. I'm sure you will enjoy it more if you make it your way. I also wanted to add that you really need to squeeze all the liquid out. Its a bit tricky because it seems as though more liquid keeps coming out. So I suggest as you are forming them, keep squeezing the extra liquid out. That might be the reason some people had trouble with them falling apart.

Browla1,
I wrote the recipe and there is no need to pre cook the meat filling, the frying time should be enough to cook the meat through.

Oh man this sounds good! I think I will try it tonight! You know what else might be a great idea is instead of ground beef make it breakfast and have pork sausage and eggs for the filling!!!

These were good, but a little bland. I agree with one reviewer that sausage would be wonderful! I drizzled mine with a little gravy and my hubby and I both liked them better that way. The hamburger does not need to be cooked first since it is only 2 teaspoons spread thinly on each pancake. 7 minutes is plenty of time to thoroughly cook it. BTW, for all of you who are leaving one star with comments that you haven't even tried the recipe yet, you should know that this is where you review a recipe, not make comments or ask questions. You're bringing down the average review rating when you do this.

I made a few changes and will rate the result of those changes. Firstly, this is a great mealtime idea; only my meal was breakfast! Secondly, I will, because of the response,  do this again. I had enough egg substitute to use in the potato mixture and only one egg left in the fridge which I used for the "filling". My filling was a good premium breakfast sausage! I omitted the garlic (no big fan, here) and used maybe a couple tablespoons finely diced onion. I pre-cooked the sausage and onion so the onion wouldn't be crunchy, just until the pink was gone in the meat, drained it really well and then continued with recipe as written. I put a drizzle of maple syrup on mine and the GK's wanted a dusting of powdered sugar on theirs.  Big tall glasses of OJ, steaming coffee and a delicious breakfast was enjoyed by all!!

This recipe was very good, in my opinion.  As the 'author' of the recipe said, it is a basic recipe, designed to tweak. I did customize to my own taste and added both shredded onion as well as garlic powder to the recipe.  I can think of all sorts of ways to change it up and enjoy it all.  Thanks Tallya for your contribution!

So good!!  I used ground round instead of beef and it turned out great. Both my kids LOVED it.  My husband found the filling to be alittle bland so I will definately play around with this recipe but adding different spices to the 'meat' and potatoes.  I did put cheese in with the 'meat' like others suggested.  It's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!!

Yummmo! Made these last night and I had the boys (big and small) begging before I was even done cooking them all!   As a time saver I used Simply Potatoes shredded hashbrown potatoes - 3 bags worth. Topped both with shredded cheese as others had suggested. Had 2 skillets going: one with ground beef middle and one w/bulk sausage middle. So breakfast AND dinner cooked at same time!  **FYI**Didn't cook either beef or sausage before putting in middle and frying and came out PERFECTLY DONE**Yes, BOTH meats!!  Thank you so much for a recipe that now MUST go into dinner rotation!

The ground beef should be precooked and I think this should be specified in the recipe.  I put a little cheese on top and served with salsa, ketsup and sour cream on the side.  Was a hit!

U made this just this morning for the ranch crew and it was a huge success!  I cooked only half of the amount the reciped makes in the beginning because I was unsure how they would go over...they were gone before I could start the second half =)  I had a bit of trouble getting the potato mix to cook fully though.  Next time I think I will brown them and put them on a sheet pan in the oven, just to be sure.  I also took the suggestion of cooking the meat prior to assembling the pancakes which was a good idea as everything came together very well.  Next time I will prepare and cook the sausage the night before as well as prep the potato mix because it took me considerably longer than 20 minutes to prepare (nearly an hour due to the potato grating)  All in all, this recipe was as delicious as it looks and I will be adding it to the breakfast menu for sure!

As made according to the recipe, these were quite tasty! I'd implore you to make one to taste before you cook them all up. I found that by adding a little Italian seasonings to the potatoes, 2 Tbs soy sauce and 1 Tbs ketchup to the filling they were AMAZING!

Made these exactly according to the recipe.  They tasted better than I expected when I was smelling them while they were cooking but were still pretty bland.  I cooked the meat before putting it in the filling.  I can't imagine that it would get cooked through if you didn't cook it first.  The stuffing definitely needs a little more flavor.  I would suggest adding some cheese, more onion and some diced bell peppers.  Adding some garlic to the potatoes would also add some needed flavor.  All the shredding was too much work for no better than they turned out.  Probably won't make these again.

This was a super delicious recipe and I will be making this again. It is important to note that I changed a few things up. I increased the potato and meat portions. After I grated my potato, I pressed the water out with a ricer. This helped keep my pancakes together when it was time to fry. I precooked my ground beef making sure to drain and rinse excess fat. There were some extra seasonings added to the beef afterwards including Worcestershire sauce, extra garlic powder, and ketchup. I also added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to my potato mixture. 
This was completely amazing and it could work well with different toppings. My husband enjoyed them with ketchup. I used sour cream, cilantro, and salsa. It was very good.

I cheated and used frozen hashbrowns and added more seasonings to the meat. My 2 and 4 year old girls LOVED this!  Easier to do than I thought, great, simple recipe!

I thought this recipe looked neat, so I wanted to try it. There was no way I was going to peel and grate 8 potatoes for a recipe I had never even eaten. So, I used 2-20oz bags of simply potatoes shredded plain hashed browns. I also just minced instead of grated the onion. I found making the patties to be fairly easy and used kitchen scoops to get the correct amounts. The patties did stay together well, but I feared they burger wouldn't cook in time, and cooked them much longer than suggested. Overall they didn't have a lot of flavor though, and the burger couldn't be tasted much. I ended up eating it with ketchup and it tasted more like french fries with a little burger then. I made 5 so far, but will probably just cook the rest in a pan separately.

This was something different and it worked! I added cheese and left out the bread crumbs. I loved the idea essentially and will do it again probably without a recipe. Great idea!

this sounds great.  I bet it would also be good to use breakfast sausage in place of the ground beef.

I made these with mild breakfast sausage instead of ground beef since that is what I had on hand. I got 8 patties out of it so maybe my patties were a bit smaller. I cooked them on low so they cooked well on the inside when the outsides were browned. I did not need to precook the meat to get them done through this way. Did not need much oil to fry them in either...just sprayed a little veggie oil on the pan and the grease that cooked out of the meat took It from there.

I enjoyed this very much. It could use some more salt though. I followed others suggestions about the meat - I made the meat mixture and then sauteed it, then followed the rest of the instructions. Came out delish.

These were pretty tasty! I used a package of frozen hashbrowns and had a lot of meat left over which I just made 2 hamburgers with for lunch the next day. Next time I will either use less potatoes per patty or more meat. It wasn't very balanced (my fault).

Okay - I had been wanting to make these for a long time, and I was pretty disappointed at how bland these were. I had even increased the quantity of garlic powder, added some crushed red pepper flakes and paprika to the meat while cooking it (I REALLY don't know how the ground beef would have cooked properly if I had just put it in the middle of the pancakes raw), but the whole thing was not very flavorful, especially for the effort required. Even adding cheddar didn't salvage it in my opinion. I didn't give it two stars because I think it has potential and I'll try it again, but this time with a ton more seasonings in the potato mixture as well.

I JUST made these, (halved the recipe as it's just me I have to feed) and it was great!  I used breakfast sausage instead of ground beef, and as it had enough spices in it already, I didn't bother adding any more, but I doubled the egg for the filling.  It was easy and delicious.  My only regret was that I didn't add more filling to them.  Next time I'm going to add three teaspoons of filling to each.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this several times in the last year. It is one of my unboring go to complete meals. Add either salsa or syrup and delicious.

I didn't like them.  I cooked the meat before hand.  Had a difficult time turning them.  They stuck to the pan.

Excellent!!  I wasn't sold by just reading the recipe but tried it because it was unique.  I would like to try it again with hot turkey sausage as the filling.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Used shredded fresh potatoes (in a green bag)found in Dairy dept at Kroger and that made it much easier! Added Garlic and I pre-cooked meat mixture to eliminate grease. These were awesome!

We eat potato pancakes often, this receipe really caught my eye. We tried it the same evening and it was just great. We did make a slight change, we fried the ground beef first then followed the instructions in the receipe. Wonderful experience, washed it down with a glass of white wine.

Very good!  I added cheese to some in the middle and some I added on top. Great with sour cream.  I did mess up and add the onions to the potato mixture instead of to the meat.  Will make again.  I wonder if you could use frozen shredded potatoes???

I made this recipe several times and my family loves it! I do take a short cut and use a box of dry potato pancake mix instead of making the pancakes from scratch. There is no need to precook the meat as it cooks along with the pancake mix. Use a non-stick pan and they will not stick. I serve this as a dinner meal topped with brown gravy and soup and vegs with it.

I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but I must have messed up somewhere as these did NOT stick together at all.  I even left them in the oil for a little longer hoping they'd stick better that way, but when I went to flip them, they fell apart all over the place.  I wound up with a big mess of slop in my skillet.  They were kinda bland too.  So much for surprising my husband with breakfast :(

i give this a high rating bec anything that my 4 yr old son eats must be good and he ate a whole one of these!  side note: i use only lean (93/7) ground turkey in everything that calls for meat.. they were a little time consuimg but that could be because i was using a new frying pan and it took longer than i would've liked to brown.  i had some leftover meat and made meatballs..nummy!  which gave me an idea.. a couple days later, i made a small batch of just the filling and made turkey burgers..they were fabulous, super moist, the best turkey burgers i've ever had.  i love multiple use recipes..another idea maybe you could use sweet potatoes and sausage.

I made these tonight for dinner & they were absolutely delish!! The only thing I added was some shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the meat mixture. I had some of it leftover so I made meatballs with it, which were delicious as well! :) I'll definitely make these again!

Made this for dinner tonight, and it was delicious and filling! I cooked the beef and drained the fat before filling the pancakes. For the beef, I  added spices (garlic and a little allspice). To the potatoe mixture, I used a whole onion and 3 cloves of garlic for taste, and also, added 1/2 cup of additional flour and 1/4 cup of milk (which makes the potatoe more of a batter, which is easier to spread when cooking.

This was our first experience with potato pancakes.  Bland and greasy - it will be a long time before we try another potato pancake recipe.  This wasn't bad, but not worth making.

If I cooked this again, I would add Green peppers and sausage.  The flavor end result are not far from traditional eggs and hash browns.  The suggested ingredients left much to be desired.  Kind of bland.  Decent texture.  The effort exceeded the end result.  On a positive note, it was a great substitute for sugary early morning recipes and it was overly greasy.

This recipe was very delicious! I basically had to pulse the potatoes in a blender after cutting them into tiny pieces so it could heat up on the stove. I added just a bit of creole seasoning to the potatoes and I added some fresh spinach to the beef. These came out delicious and my family absolutely loves them! Only thing is it took me two hours to peel, cut and blend the potatoes and get everything ready. The cheese is an amazing addition, especially when biting into the potato pancake. 8.5/10 would make again.

I found it was better to dry the shredded potatoes before combing in egg mixture. Also, make the cakes small and relatively thin so the potatoes can cook through. The kids ate them with ketchup and said them to be delicious.

I tried it as the recipe reads. Making beef filled potato pancakes. It was a total nightmare. The potato was getting stuck to the pan dispite using oil and the beef was never going to fully cook before the potatoes were done. So I threw out that batch made the rest of the meat into patties and served with remaining potatoes on the side. Ended up being delicious! My husband loved it as did I. I added cheese to beef mixture. Also added garli powder to potato mixture..yummy

What a tasty, easy, and quick meal!!! I added the cheese as suggested, and also used Italian bread crumbs for a little more flavor.  My husband who rarely complements my cooking raved about this dish.  Thanks so much for the "keeper" recipe.

the picture looked so good but i was disappointed with the turnout, the meat was bland i did add sea salt, pepper, extra onion. concept is good but potato pancakes are bland anyway so they really should be doctored before cooking. I don't think i will make these again, but i can see where using frozen hash browns and sausage for breakfast might have more flavor

These were pretty good!  My daughter, the picky eater, had three helpings.  I had to leave the onions out, added parmesan to the potato mixture, and added shredded cheddar and mozzarella to the meat mixture.  It seemed a little bland to me, even with the addition of some garlic powder, tho.  I had some leftover brown gravy from dinner the nite before.  Heated that up and poured it over the pancakes.  It made all the difference.  Will definitely make these again, with the addition of the gravy.

As written, I'd only give this a 3 out of 5.  However, with a bit of spicing up -- perhaps following some or all of the suggestions of other reviewers -- it could bump up to a 4 or even a 5.  I, too, wasn't sure if I should cook the beef, beforehand, or not.  It seemed to me that it wouldn't cook by itself between the layers, so I decided to follow comments of other reviewers and assume that the beef was to be cooked.

Didn't really like this version of potato pancakes. I was raised on kosher potato pancakes made and served only with dairy products and I still eat them thus.  Of course, there's no culinary restriction to filling potato pancakes with lean ground beef 'in-betweens' - they're divine tasting for most diners and my table mates gobbled them up greedily.  Two stars from the chef and three from the diners was the count on these latkes.

For the potato pancake part try putting the ingredients in the blender and grate to the consistence you want.  It works great and saves time

These weren't out of this world, but they were pretty tasty. My hubby seemed to like them well enough too.

Very difficult to make!!  I don't know how you are supposed to get the ground beef fully cooked by cooking it in a pan with the potatoes on the outside.  I ended up putting them in the microwave after they came out of the pan in order to cook the beef.  

They tasted ok...but very time consuming for a mediocre product.

Not sure what I did wrong with this recipe, but it kept falling apart rather than sticking together. I made it as written. It was a waste for us. Won't make it again.

These were delicious and my family loved them!  The leftovers are going in the kids lunches as "heatups".  I used sage flavored sausage ...yummy!  A dollop of light sour cream was added on my portion.  I thought you put it on baked potato so....My husband said this is a keeper.  His idea is a great breakfast meal....make beforehand and heat up when you want  to eat.

We have been making potato pancakes for years, but this is a new and great idea.  Our pancakes include lots of onion and we serve applesauce and sausage on the side.  Can't wait to try this one with my own spices, etc!  It's more like a main meal than breakfast.  Thanks
