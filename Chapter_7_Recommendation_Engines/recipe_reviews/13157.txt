While the flavor of this chili is close to Skyline (not quite there though) the texture is all wrong. You do NOT brown the beef in a Cincinnati chili recipe, there are no "chunks" or bits of meat. You have to boil the raw beef in the broth first then add the rest of the ingredients once the meat has cooked down into a pasty-type consistency. Also the onions are meant to stay raw and be put on top of the finished dish.

I have been using this site since 2003 and this is the first time I've felt compelled to post. 

I traveled to Cincinnati for business for several years and always enjoyed Skyline Chili.  Now I will intentionally get schedule layovers in Ohio to get my 4-way fix.  

This is the closest recipe I've ever been able to make - it was just delicious!  I did boil my hamburger in the broth as other posters suggested - but I did continue to add 2 cups of broth as it boiled down.  We boiled the meat for 2 hours and it had a pretty fine consistency at that point.

We upped the cinnamon by 50% like others suggested and also shorted the chili powder by 1/4 (we ran out).  Heavenly on spaghettini with finely shredded mild cheddar!!

Can't wait to bring this to work for lunch.  YUM!

Very, very good! This recipe is very true to what you will find in the Cincinnati Chili parlors. I reccomend you use 50% more cinnamon than in the recipe and a litle more chili powder. This is not the recipe to try if you are looking for a twist on a "traditional" chili, it is more of what most people would consider a "spaghetti sauce". It is best served over a plate of thin spaghetti, topped with finely chopped white onions ans mounded finely shredded mild cheddar cheese. The chili should be VERY hot when served this way so as to melt the cheese as you eat it. Traditionally it is served with oyster crackers used to soak up the left over juice after the spaghetti is gone. Enjoy!

This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite recipes from this site.  I have adapted it to our tastes - no chopped onion while cooking (use onion powder for the smooth texture), and I cook the ground beef in an additional cup or two of broth then drain to remove the extra fat - I also have added more broth and just simmered until it all reduces and gets beautiful and smooth and thick.  Also I add just a touch of molasses (maybe a tsp or two).  Freezes beautifully, if you ever have any left - we never seem to.  This has been a big hit at family gatherings, and we also like to serve it on hot dogs as a change from serving over spaghetti (sacrilege, I know, but it's GOOD! LOL).

This is very close to Skyline Chili (what I think of when I think of Cincinnati), except that Skyline chili doesn't have onions in it.  Diced raw onion, beans, shredded cheddar are the traditional accompaniments, when the basic chili is served over hot spaghetti.  

You can use cocoa (3T) instead of the unsweetened chocolate in this recipe, you don't need the oil if you are serving the onions raw on top.   My family prefers it with the chili powder halved, no cayenne, and all the other spices bumped up a bit -- including 1/4 t of ground cardamom.

Of all the Cincinnati Chili recipes I've tried (incl. the ones you get from the Airport in Cincinnati w/the "authentic" recipe, this is by far the most authentic.  If you're looking for the taste of Skyline outside of Cinci, this is the recipe to try.  It is not your traditional chili recipe if that's what you're looking for.  This one is Greek in origin & is really meant to be more of a sauce to be served    "3-way" (on spaghetti w/shredded cheddar cheese, 4-way (same as 3-way + chopped onions or red beans), or "5-way" (3-way + onions & red beans).  It's the chocolate that gives it its richness & unique taste.

My grandma lived just outside of Cincinnati and had a chili recipe with nearly 100 ingredients that was AWESOME! This is pretty close to that and obviously a lot easier. 

   I prefer to "boil the beef" in the beef broth with chopped onions or onion salt before adding the other ingredients. I also leave out the cayenne and bay leaf, use more chili powder, cumin, allspice, and add some sugar and worchestershire sauce.

This is an excellent recipe, indistinguishable from Skyline chili.  Lovely spices, great texture.  I added the beef broth while cooking the burger, and the texture was smooth, like the restaurant variety.  Fortunately I made a double recipe and froze half for later!

I loved this chili.  My father's family is from Cincinnati and we are total Cincinnati chili addicts.  While this wasn't an exact match for the famous Skyline chili, it was quite close and very yummy.  My father mixed the spices, my mother cooked the meat, I read directions and ingredients and we all took turns stirring and it went so smoothly, we were impressed.  Definitely a recipe I will be making again.

This must be an acquired taste.  We did not care for the blend of spices.  I am from the west coast and like spicy sauces.  My hubby is from N.Dakota and likes bland sauces.  Neither of us could eat this.  It was just weird.

I live in the Cincinnati Area and have for my whole life. This is a good recipe. -- Here's what I did. After boiling it in beef broth for about a 1/2 hour and draining it, I put the meat in the food processor for a few seconds. It was the perfect consistency and looked exactly as it should.   How to serve it up: For 3-Ways, 4-Ways and 5-Ways. On a small warm plate layer the following: (1)"Thin" Spaghetti  (2)Kidney Beans   (3)Chili    (4)"Diced" Sweet Onions (NOT chopped)  (5)Finely Shredded Cheddar Cheese piled high. It's best to shred your own so it's still nice and fluffy, if cheese can be called fluffy. Also, try dribbling some Hot Sauce and Oyster Crackers over the top.  How to eat it -- DON'T MIX IT UP or anything. Just take your fork and slice into it one bite at a time. --- Serve up a Cheese Coney like this: On a warm hotdog bun  (1)A thin line of mustard.  (2)Small, skinny Hotdog (if you can find them)  (3)Chili  (4)"Diced" Sweet Onions  (5) Cheese.  (Don't forget the hot sauce, if you prefer it.) Omitting any of the layers is totally up to your taste.   Just my opinion: Cincinnati Chili is meant to be eaten with spaghetti or as a coney and not as an actual "bowl" of chili. Most Cincinnatians would agree with me I think.  Another side note: It's not "Gold Star Chili" which is my favorite Cincinnati Chili, but I plan on tweeking this recipe to get it as close to that as possible. Though this is a very good Cincinnati style chili recipe.

OH. MY. GOODNESS! I halved this, and skipped the vegetable oil. Also, I used cocoa powder (1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon for the half recipe) instead of the unsweetened chocolate - and an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce. I simmered the beef in the broth for about 20 minutes, then added everything else to simmer for an hour. If you brown the beef first, you will have lumpy chili - you want the beef to be in very tiny bits. I was craving Skyline, and this was a delicious alternative for someone who lives hundreds of miles from the nearest franchise. Cheese and onions are a fantastic finish, and oyster crackers if you like. Thank you, MARBALET!

I have lived in Cincinnati for the last 12 years, and I think this recipe is actually better than the restaurant versions because it has a little bit more of a kick! I think the texture is most similar to the restaurants if you just throw everything in the slow cooker and cook on low for 8-10 hours. I have also used lean ground turkey in place of the beef and it was just as delicious! Thank you sooo much for posting, we make this every week =)

This recipe was great!! We eat at a Skyline or two every time my family passes through the Ohio/Kentucky area where they are prevalent, and I have eaten at the original, with lines out the door for lunch every day, many times. I have tried a number of other recipes for Skyline (Cincinnati) chili (from this site and others)and this is the closest recipe to "the real thing" at the original Skyline (downtown Cincinnati) of all of them--especially when you include the notes from the other reviewers and mine below:

1. if you want the very fine consistency, You must cook the hamburger in the broth first. Then drain, and add back new broth--I recommend using beef bouillon cubes for the broth--works fine, and it's cheap.  (You can do this in a crockpot for 12 hours on low, the night before.) However, this recipe comes out just fine if you skip this step.

2. Once beef is browned or cooked with onions:
-Do double the cinnamon and increase the chili powder as others recommend
-I used at least a tablespoon of onion powder and garlic powder
-I substitute 3 tbsp cocoa powder and a tbsp of butter for the chocolate square (cuz I didn't have any the first time)--then add a couple of Dove Milk Chocolate squares for the touch of sweet, where some used molasses--works great

3. Cook the mixture on high in your crockpot or (simmer on the stove) for the time recommended in the recipe, and serve over pasta with finely shredded cheese and finely diced onions as shown in the picture.

Being a huge Skyline fan and living in Colorado, my wife made this for me tonight following the recipe for the most part.  She had me taste it and the flavor was great but the texture was wrong (chunky) so I used an immersion blender.  It worked great and made the texture just right.

Good, easy cincinnati chili recipe. Still not Skyline, but the flavor is close... We strained the beef after browning which made it taste a bit less greasy... Wasn't able to refrigerate overnight but still game out great.. Will definitely make this again...

Made this for dinner tonight.  My 21 y/o son who loves a local restaurant version of cincinnati chili gives this 5 stars.    The only change I made was to put all listed ingredients in a pressure cooker (after browning beef) and cooked 12 minutes under pressure. EXCELLENT!!  I will be making this frequently.

Okay...I am not a native Cincinnatian, and I HATE Cincinnati style chili. HOWEVER, my husband is born and raised here. I made this recipe for him last night and he said it was the best Cincinnati style chili he has ever had! I did make one substitution - I didn't have bar chocolate, so I used two tablespoons of cocoa powder.   On behalf of my husband and his reaction, I'm gonna give this one 5 stars!

This was delicious. Of course, my all-time favorite food is anything with a Mexican mole sauce. This tasted like mole. If you don't like mole, you probably won't like this. But, I thought it had amazing depth. I love the way you eat it and wonder, what was that flavor!?! I will make this again.

We really enjoyed this Cinci Chili, left the onions out of the recipe and topped with raw sweet onions and sharp cheddar cheese over whole wheat pasta. It was delicious and I'll definitely make this again! Looking forward to making chili cheese dogs with the leftovers!

So yummy! Great left over. I cut out the oil and I cook the ground beef in the broth, making it almost like a paste. I do not use the bay leaf and I have substituted red wine vinegar when I was out of the cider. I also add 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire and three cloves of garlic. I just love the cheddar cheese and fresh chopped onions on top.

This recipe ROCKS!  We served it at our sons graduation party and I had to send out photocopies of the recipe with his thank you notes! How often does that happen??? By far the best version of the recipe - boiled meat ewww. We never have left overs & always wish we'd doubled the recipe.  THIS ONE'S A WINNER!

My favorite recipe on this site!  Easy, delicious, and keeps well for several days!  Forget browning the meat, as others have said.  Instead, start with the broth + tomato sauce in the pot and add the ground beef (keep the onions raw if you want to make a 4-way at the end).  This helps give it authentic Skyline texture.    As an Ohioan in Texas, it is so nice to have a taste of my home state any time I want it.  But be warned-- I have found that Cincinnati-style chili is a polarizing subject!

I am not a big fan of Cincinnati Chili, nor am I an expert,  But it seems that this recipe tasted just like the Skyline Chili my husband brought back with him once.  I didn't have unsweetened cholocate square, so used unsweetened cocoa (3 tbs) and extra oil (1 tbsn).  Instead of browning the meat, I just threw the whole thing in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 4 hrs.  I then put in the frig overnight as others recommended.  It worked perfectly.  My husband can not stand high spicy foods, so I tried to decrease the amount of chili powder by 1/2.  But when I reheated the next day, I could taste the chocolate to the point of distraction.  So I added more chili powder (to match the recipe) and reheat it.  All the flavors melded together well, with no one flavor overpowering the others.  My suggestion is to follow the recipe exactly and let rest overnight in the frig before reheating/serving.  You'll either love it or hate it.

I thought this was just ok.It was my first time trying cincinnati chili so I had nothing to compare it to.It reminded me of spaghetti sauce and I kept thinking it should be sweeter or something.My husband thought it was a little bland.I won't make it again but it was fun trying it.

I've tried a couple of other Cincinnati chili recipes, and so far this is our favorite. Served as chili spaghetti with diced onions and shredded cheddar cheese on top, my husband commented that it was so good it made him homesick.

It was OK. I followed the other suggestions for boiling the beef so that it is smooth texture. Too much chili powder or something. I read lots of people rating this on an altered recipe - reducing this, increasing that. If you follow the recipe it is not that good. I give it 3 stars because it gives you a start if you want to play and alter it to your tastes.

OK. I feel horrible giving it 3 stars, but I hated it (I would have given it 1), but the Mr. and my friend loved it. In fact, they ate most of it. I had a bit and it was manageable to eat, but I couldnt get over the smell/taste combo. It tasted ok. But while it was cooking, it smelled like the spicy oatmeal cookies I make. So it was weird thinking oatmeal cookies, but tasting chili...My weirdness aside, the entire batch was eaten in a few days. I've never had this chili, so I cant compare it to anything, but there's my two cents...

The only thing that prevents this from being authentic Cincinnati chili is that it tastes WAY BETTER than anything you get in the chili parlors!  This is absolutely delicious, and you MUST try it 'Cincinnati' style: served over spaghetti and topped with grated cheddar cheese.  We call it a three-way in Cincinnati.  You'll call it your new best friend.

Prepared it the first time, and rated it 4 stars saying "Unusual..Did not  like this at first but it grew on us. Will try it again."
This time, considered the comments of someone suggesting "3 to 5 ways"... 1- Thin Spaghetti, 2- Kidney Beans, 3- Chili, 4- onions, and 5- Cheddar Cheese, with perhaps a little hot sauce....and that's 5 stars (depending on your preference)

My family and I are huge chili fans, inface i think I have around 10 recipes that are variations of chili so when I saw this I had to try it... It must be a taste thing but none of us liked the mixture of spices... then cinnamon (which we love) and cloves did not mix well with the other flavors... very dissappointing. sorry but I would only suggest trying this if you already know you are a fan of the flavors and not if you are a chili fan...

This is so fantastic and very similar to the "real thing".  No one in my family likes the texture of "boiled" ground meat, so I saute it in a skillet.  I also saute the onions (and some added garlic) in ghee after the meat and add the spices, so the flavor can come out of them, and the "brown bits" of the meat are taken up.  I use homemade beef/pork broth.  I use 3 Tbsp. of cocoa powder instead of squares.  We top it with kidney beans, diced onion, and then the cheese.  It's the most authentic over spaghetti noodles, but any type of pasta works.  Delicious!  Such a switch from "Southwest" chili!

I grew up in Cincinnati but have lived in Atlanta for the past 4+ years of my life.  I've been trying to find a good recipe for Cincinnati chili to address my all-too-often cravings.  I've finally found one.  Thanks for submitting it.  I've even given it to friends back home and they use it as well.  That certainly speaks well for the recipe!

This was so-so.  Tasted a little like Manwich (if I had to compare it to a flavour)  - not a family favourite and won't make again.  The cloves and allspice were a turn-off for us.

I used 1.25 lb ground turkey (browned in a skillet) and 2 cans of pinto beans instead of the ground beef.  I know it's not authentic that way but I knew we'd prefer it that way and it's my kitchen.  Also used 1/4 C chocolate chips stirred in shortly before serving.  Mine cooked in a slow cooker for about 5 hours and it turned out really, really well!  Just perfect.  The cinnamon, allspice, cloves and chocolate were so good and subtle and everything just came together really well.  Heck, I tasted it right after I put everything in the crock pot and it was good then too!  I brought the chili to a potluck that had a noodle theme and it was different from all the other offerings (which were all Italian).  Everyone else liked it too.  Will definitely make it again.  Next time I'll try boiling the meat but I'm still going to use ground turkey and pinto beans :)

My family loved this. I did make some changes though. I boiled the beef in the broth, first of all, to make it more authentic. The onions, I chopped and sprinkled fresh over the top. And instead of using regular spaghetti, I used angel hair spaghetti. Sooo good.

After living in Cincinnati for 7 years my husband and I really miss Skyline after moving south.  We are able to buy canned Skyline at Kroger, but this is a much healthier option.  I did make some changes.  I did not use the onions.  I boiled ground turkey in the broth and then used a hand blender to blend it up  until there were no more chunks of meat, this is the consistency of true Cincinnati chili.  Then I put all of the ingredients into the crockpot and let it cook all day.  I did use powdered cocoa instead of chocolate and increased some of the seasonings.  My only complaint was that it was dry and needed more liquid.  I'll probably add some water or more broth next time.

I lived in Cincinnati for 24 years and ate Skyline 2-3 times a month for my whole life. Moved to florida so it's hard to come by. I made this recipe and it's great. As close to Skyline Chili it gets unless you're at the restaurant. I advise boiling the meat with the broth and putting the finished product in a food processor to get the Skyline texture... Bon Appetit!

This is a really great chili sauce just written as is. My rating is for that recipe. Next time I made it, I didn't have cloves or allspice, so I used Chinese five spice which has cloves and cinnamon in it. I did use the additional cinnamon, too. And, I upped the chocolate to 2 squares. Not sure I'd do that again, but my husband and I really liked it with the 2 squares. I served this for my hubby over gluten free brown rice noodles (Tinkyadi brand is the best), and I'm diabetic so I served mine over kelp noodles (1 carb and 6 calories per four oz.) Delicious! Second time I only had 1 pound of ground beef, so I added a can of tomatoes. (Fire roasted ones.) Do try this recipe. If you want it for a main dish, it's tasty that way, too, but might not be as thick as you'd like. I also don't cook with anything but homemade beef broth, and I didn't have any, so used chicken broth instead. We ate it without holding overnight. I really couldn't tell the difference from when it was held overnight and when it wasn't. So, go ahead and make and eat the same day, if you wish.

This was really good, I have never had Skyline before but was told about it by a friend from Cincy.  We had it "4-way" style (cheese & fresh chopped onions) and DH said he likes it better than regular spaghetti sauce!  The spices are a welcome change from traditional Texas style chili.  The flavors went really well with the cheddar cheese.  The only thng I did differently was that I sauteed the onions in the bottom of the stock pot, then added the broth, brought it to a boil, added the meat, and then when it was browned, added the rest of the ingredients.  Yum!

The flavor is dead on, amazing. The texture, as many have noted is not, but this is a very easy fix. Don't brown the beef. Cook the onions, then add the liquid and the rest of the ingredients, stirring it all together. Bring it to a boil, then add the raw beef, reduce to a simmer. Break the meat up very throughly with a spatula..it will clump if you don't. Cover and cook the suggested time, and this will be exactly as it should be.

LUV it.  Nothing bad to say.  This is an amazing recipe.  Tru cincinnati chili... no, but the flavor is amazing and pretty darned close.  Also, unless you are looking for a heart attack by cooking with the fat that comes with tru cincinnati - this is a great tasting recipe.

This was really good.  We love Skyline Chili, and this is the closest I've come to duplicating that distinctive flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

This chili turned out really well!  Based on other reviews, I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I used 1 1/2 tbs of cocoa powder and 1/2 tbs of vegetable oil (per instructions on cocoa box for substituting 1/2 square of baking chocolate).  I used 1 tbs of onion powder instead of cooking the onion and left out the vegetable oil that the recipe calls for.  I added a few dashes of paprika and a generous sprinkle of garlic powder.    To get a texture similar to that of Skyline, I boiled the 2 lbs of beef in the beef broth, and chopped up the meat with the spoon.    Next time, I think I will use a leaner ground beef (I just bought the standard stuff).  The fat separates from the rest of the chili.    Overall, very good recipe!  It's not quite like Skyline, but pretty close.  It's a very good Cincinnati-style chili recipe in its own right.

We started making this chili from this very recipe about a year ago and it is consistently a favorite meal. The chili is hearty, well-seasoned and very tasty. This chili has converted me to the "chili has no beans" side of the chili fight.

Super tastey, but I still have to use a stick blender to get the consistancy right...  Otherwise an easy to make, pretty-close-to-Skyline alternative that's definitely cheaper than having a can shipped 1000 miles away.  We always have it with raw diced onions, tons of finely shredded cheddar, and some hot sauce - yummm...    Oh, it also makes a great "Coney" (basically a chili dog)!

This is such a great recipe...very close to what you get in Cincinnati.  The only thing I do differently to make it more "authentic" is not add the onions to the sauce while cooking, but put finely chopped raw onions on top when serving.  Of course this is optional, but that's how it's done Cinci.  We also top with Kidney Beans and cheese.  This is really great over french fries too. I'm a southwest girl myself, but after visiting Ohio a few times and eaten this chili, I'm a big fan.  My whole family loves this and we make it regularly.  A nice change of pace from your run of the mill chili or spaghetti.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I make a very similar chili, with a few changes;1 lb ground beef, 1 lb sausage; 1 can chix broth, 1 can beef broth. Use 1 oz of the chocolate & cut down just a bit on the cinnamon & allspice otherwise it's a little overpowering. I throw in a can of chili beans due to personal taste. You will never make another kind of chili again! It's so rich & wonderful; the longer you simmer the better!

Can you say YUCK?
Man alive - do not make this for a new boyfriend.  I thought he was going to break up with me after he tried it.  He now jokes and says - please don't make that cinnamon chili again - He's even started calling me Allspice. I wanted to package this up and give it to homeless people and tell them it's breakfast lunch and dinner rolled into one!  I sure hope my chili pot doesn't still smell like cinnamon when I throw it out!

I don't know what all the fuss is about. I am NOT a finicky eater (I grew up on cafeteria food -- and I LIKED it), but I couldn't even finish eating my chili. I followed the recipe to the letter, even refrigerating it and eating it later. I don't know what I did wrong, but my wife and I won't try this one again.

The best way to achieve the correct texture for authentic Cincinnati chili is to add the liquid BEFORE you add the beef, then stir until the beef is broken up into very small pieces.  I had a friend who used his hands to break the meat up.  This will create the almost smooth texture you want for the real thing.

4 1/2:  really good, but heavy (cincy chili always is I guess).  Need to add the beans to make it 5-way.  Did the boil technique from the comments and added 2 cups beef broth twice.  Other than that, followed recipe as is for boxing day dinner w/ family.

tastes just like Skyline chili! The spices should probably be amped up a little. I'll double them next time.

This recipe is the ultimate Tailgate chili. Its traditionally toped on spaghetti but we like it on hebrew nation hotdogs toped with cheese onions and tobasco hot sauce. My Boys literally beg me to make this every football get together.

I didn't much care for this, but I'm not big on chili.  My husband, however, loves chili, and he thought this was great.  He went back for seconds and is looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the overnight refrigeration.  Instead, I just simmered it for a long time.  I guess we will try the overnight refrigeration step tonight and see how the leftovers turn out tomorrow.  :)

I thought this was great as did my boyfriend who probably eats Skyline about once a week!  He did agree it was a little different but liked it all the same.  Couple of changes - no onion, boiled the meat in the stock and tomato sauce rather than browned, added about 1 tsp of garlic powder, 2T of cocoa rather than the chocolate, less cinnamon probably 1/2 tsp as it is not my most favorite spice.  I also used ground turkey and chicken stock rather than the beef.  Next time I will use my immersion blender to get a thinner consistency.  Thanks!

I'm on a very, very strict diet, but I was determined to make Cincinnati Chili that I could eat. I used this recipe as a guide. I subbed ground turkey for the beef, diet chicken bouillon for the beef bouillon, diet tomato soup for the tomato sauce and chocolate extract for the unsweetened chocolate. I added everything else as it's called for here. With the spices and such in this recipe I couldn't tell the difference between my diet version and the Cincinnati Chili I love at Hard Times Cafe. I served mine with fresh tomatoes and a little shredded colby jack. It was TERRIFIC! The family even loved it and asked for seconds. I can't wait to make it again!

When making Cincinnati chili at home, to get the fine consistency, you can chill the sauce and then run it through the food processor.  Then heat it back up.  When combining this step with boiling the meat in the broth, it's perfection.

Cincinnati chili has never been my thing, but my partner LOVES it. I've tried a few recipes, and this is the only one I enjoy. I made it exactly as written and it was quite good. I definitely recommend following the direction to refrigerate overnight and reheat again the next day. We ate some right after cooking and it was OK, but the next day when we reheated the sauce, it was SO much better!

I too, wanted to duplicate Skyline chili and after reading the wonderful comments, am quite happy to have found this recipe.   Making this for a church youth fund raiser, I was making a huge batch. I am SO GRATEFUL for the servings calculator and shopping list functions on this site. I made a batch for 33 servings!  Starting with the boiling broth, I crumbled the beef in three batches, using a potato masher at the end of each batch when I no longer saw pink. After the meat had boiled a while I removed from heat and skimmed the fat, then adding additional broth. I also substituted onion powder for the chopped onion. (1/3 cup = 1 teaspoon onion powder)  This is a great recipe that should win the hearts of any Skyline Chili fan!

I had lost my original recipe for Cincinnati Chili, and through searching for what seems forever, online, I found this recipe. I knew it was the one, because it was the only one that included 2 cans of beef broth. the only change I made was to leave out the chocolate, and upped the cinnamon a dash.  It was then the recipe I was looking for.  Don't try any other recipe. This is the closest there is!

I am a Cincinnati native now living in Texas.  I ate Skyline for over 40 years and I can tell you this recipe is very, very close.  I did not put the onion in but used 1/2 tsp onion powder. The only thing I will change next time will be to cut back a little on the vinegar.  I browned the beef separatly, drained the grease and added to the heating broth mixture.  Brought it all to a boil, reduced heat, covered, and simmered for 1-1/2 hours. Then I used a stick blender as was previously suggested.  The consistency was dead on. I let simmer for another 1/2 hour and refrigerated overnight.  Next day I reheated slowly and let simmer for 30 minutes and servied piping hot over spaghetti and topped with grated cheddar.  The next night I made cheese coneys with the leftovers.  Both were delicious.  This will definelty help when I need a Skyline "fix".  Now, if someone could provide a La Rosa's spaghetti sauce recipe...

The method for getting the texture right is to add only powdered ingredients, i.e. no chopped garlic or onions, but garlic powder.  You don't brown the ground beef, you add the beef to cold water and mash it until it becomes a liquid paste (cold,) then you add the spices, bring to a boil, then simmer.  There will be no need to puree the result and the texture will exactly duplicate the restaurant style.

The best way to make this REALLY traditional is to use an immersion blender at the end to make the sauce smoother -- less meat texture.  It looks more like thick gravy, but is surprisingly just right for this recipe.

It will never taste 100% like the real deal, but this is very close.  Skyline is my all-time favorite restaurant.  I would suggest using the finely shredded cheese to make it a bit more authentic, and serve the cheese at room temp.  So freakin' yummy!!

The flavors were unusual, but good.  Next time, I'd make mine a little thicker by adding some beans or simmering a while without the top on - it kind of sunk when I poured it over the spaghetti.

This was awesome! The only changes I made were that I used 2T unsweetened cocoa powder instead of squares and I used 2 cans of broth and 1 12oz. bottle of beer(I made a double recipe). I'm so glad I can get my 5-way fix anytime, even though I'm 600 miles from Cincy!

This was the closest recipe I've found so far to authentic Cincinnati chili, but you really need to mix the dry spices in the meat and then add the broth while mashing up the raw meat with a potato masher in order to get the meat texture right. Also only used about 2T of the chili powder as the real thing isn't that hot. There is still a depth of flavor that is missing; maybe if I could have waited overnight for the flavors to meld.....

This was good, but not comparable to Skyline.  I added extra chili powder and lots of salt - next time will increase the amount of onions.  Also, as with other Cincinnati Chili recipes I've used, I didn't cook the onion or brown the hamburger first, I put it all in together and broke it apart as it cooked.  Using a whisk helps get the right texture.

As a native Cincinatian, I can tell you that the taste of this chili is nothing like traditional Skyline.  So if that's what you're looking for, this is not it.  However, after adding a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of salt to the recipe, I thought the chili was pretty good.  But I am still craving real Cincinnati chili.

Seems to be a PRETTY CLOSE rendition of the tasty product I miss from my Ohio days.  Not exact... but close.   Use good, greasy tasty ground beef.  Not the low fat type!!!   Was a bit DRIER than I'm used to having it.

Very tasty! But since Holly doesn't explain the classes of Cinti chili, i.e. 3-way, 4-way (bean), 5-way (onion), it's easy to forget to buy beans (which makes it a "4-way-bean.").

So, twice I went to the store, bought all the ingredients I didn't have, and forgot to get red kidney beans!

Excellent!  I've never had chili in Cincinnati (only heard about it from my husband), but this is a great recipe.  Very unusual and delicious, and wonderful on spaghetti with cheese and onions.

We made this recipe in my chili class today and we all gave it a high five for flavor. I think making it a day or so ahead would bump it up even more. This was delicious and I am not from Cincinnati. Next time, I would add more cinnamon and chili powder. A veg version without ground beef would not stop me from trying it with tempeh, TVP or some veg burgers crumbled into the sauce. It's all about the FLAVOR!  YUM!

This is an authentic Cincinnati-style chilli recipe! Tastes just like gold star chilli!!! With minor modification just as some of the other posts. I boiled the ground beef in the beef broth and added an extra teaspoon of ground cinnamon and an extra teaspoon of ground cumin and it came out perfect! With my serving adjustments to 20 servings, I was able to make a full five quart crock pot of  cincinnati style  chilli. Thanks

This is really good but you do not brown the meat first.  You mix it with the liquid and break it up with a spatula. The texture is wrong if you brown the meat first. The spice mixture in this recipe is very close to the original Skyline chilli. The original recipe I used was from a book that had a recipe from each state that had that state's signature dish and Cincinnati chilli was Ohio's.  Somewhere I misplaced that book and have been searching for this recipe ever since. This is the closest I've found. Definitely serve it over spaghetti, and top with your choice of red beans, chopped onion and shredded cheddar cheese or use all 3. I only put the cheese on mine

This was really good!  My husband was craving the Skyline Chili we had in Cincinnati and this was just as good! I did as other reviews suggested and cooked the raw meat (95% lean) in the beef stock to break it down more.  Also kept onions raw to add as a topping.  Definite keeper and sure to be crowd pleaser!

My boyfriend discovered an easy variation for leftover Cincy Chili. 

All you need is a box of Deluxe Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, the kind with the soft cheese packet. Prepare according to the box instructions and stir in one half cup of warmed chili. You can add more chili if you like :)

This is a great way to make 3 way chili fast!

I saw this on the recipe buzz a few times, so I wanted to try it. I never had "Cincinnati" or "Skyline" chili before. It was like a slightly thick coney style  sauce on top of spaghetti with cheese and diced onions. Two of us worked on this, one measuring the spices and the other cooking the onions and beef, and so the prep went pretty fast. I used beef base and made my own broth to taste and used 2 lbs of lean beef. I worked at a coney island that made something similar, but theirs came out of can, with some quite weird byproducts. So, making the original was my first time trying this. Not a regular recipes, but interesting.

i have never been outside of Texas but i have a friend from Cincinnati and she would bring me Skyline chili when she went home to visit...I love it so much that I couldn't wait for her to go back home so I needed a recipe and found yours. I have shared it with so many people... I have been using your recipe for 6 years now! I just brought some to work and it is still a hit. My nephew makes it now along with other family members. 

My tweaks are: 

omit the onion and use it for putting on top of the chili after its done.

use pureed tomatoes and tomato paste instead of sauce. 

use rounded/heaping spoons for extra flavor.

toast spices before adding meat and sauces.

I made this over the weekend here in the DC area for people that were Ohio Natives... I was told that this tasted exactly like Skyline Chili - which I never had.   My only change to the recipe was adding some pepper and salt - and I topped it with some finely chopped raw onions.

I made a few changes and this chili turned out really good. I used a chuck roast and cut it into small pieces and I omitted the chocolate,not because I didn't want to use it, but because I didn't have any on hand. Anyway, I simmered it until that beef got really tender-- and wow! Because my husband doesn't like chili with beans and I do, I cooked some black beans on the side to add to mine... delicious :)

I read this recipe the other day and went to the freezer to take out some ground beef! I love this kind of chili, and have been making it for a few years after having first tried not in Cincinnati but in Chicago. I'm not a bean person and I love the whole cinnamon and chocolate thing going on in this chili. Anyway, my recipe is nearly the same but I puree the onion in a food processer as this chili should be smooth in texture. It then goes right in with the meat. I also add sour cream as one of the toppings. Great recipe, thanks!

I'm a Florida girl with no frame of reference on how this should taste.  Also, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  Thus,  4-stars vs.  5 stars.   My changes:  Boiled the beef in the broth for 1 hour, mashing with potato masher every 15 minutes.  2nd hour: add dry spices--double the cinnamon, halve the chili powder, and add 1 scant Tbsp cumin, not 1 tsp.  Also, include 1/2 teaspoon onion powder and chocolate, still stirring every 15 minutes.  For 3rd hour, add remaining ingredients plus 1 teaspoon each, molasses and worcestershire.  Simmer another hour and a half for a total 3 and a half hours. Don't forget to skim the fat.  Cool to room temp and refrigerate.   Today, I brought it to room temp and reheated for a couple hours.  Because raw onions don't sit well with me, I sauteed them in a little oil for about a minute to take the edge off.  Set it all out with spaghetti, shredded cheddar, kidney beans (drained, rinsed and heated), and oyster crackers. Family went back for seconds and thirds and then strongly suggested I add this to my rotation.

We really liked this chili. We left out the cloves and substituted cocoa for the square of chocolate, but other than that, followed the recipe and had it "5-way", and then again as chili dogs, with uncured natural beef franks. Good stuff.

Very good recipe!  I used turkey instead of beef and used a hand blender to give it the right texture.  Great alternative to buying the packets at the store.

Like other reviewers I also boiled the beef in broth first, with all the spices and saved the onion for topping later (green onions or red onions when I have them!).  Added 1 T white sugar and 1 tsp. salt to suit our tastes, and only had unsweetened cocoa powder in, so I used 1 1/2 tsp.  Although I am not a Cincy native, without these changes it tasted like "something was missing."

My guests loved this! The Ohio native gave it a huge thumbs up! I used many of the changes others have mentioned: I boiled the ground beef in a mixture of broth/water until the beef was smooth;  after draining it, I added more beef broth and continued with the recipe; I added a tsp of molasses and used a square of dark chocolate instead of baking chocolate; and I saved the onions as a topping.

This recipe is great! All the spices blend together to make one very flavorful dish. The only change was I added a bit more cheese. It is better than Skyline Chili!! Jane

My husband and I both grew up in Cincinnati and loved this chili. It is very similar to Skyline. I boiled the ground beef in beef broth, but still couldn't get the consistency of traditional Skyline, but didn't effect the taste. We can buy frozen skyline here in Ga., but since this recipe fed a family of 4 for 3 meals, it is more cost effective to make it instead of buying the frozen stuff. Of course, nothing beats going to Skyline and having the real stuff. P.S.-Kroger brand oyster crackers taste just like the crackers at Skyline restaurants...adds a finishing touch on a great meal. Thanks for the recipe.

I have a recipe that's very similar to this that calls for boiling the ground beef.  It's as close to Cincy Chili as you can get without going directly to Skyline.  I wanted to suggest that, if you have a stick blender, you can actually blend the chili before adding other ingredients to make a smoother consistency.

I grew up on this stuff. Cincinnati has some of the best foods ever. I have yet to find any places in NJ or NYC that come close to my hometown faves. Good stuff. Not entirely skyline but.. close.

This recipe is soooo close to Skyline!  I grew up on that stuff, but now live in Nebraska -- where people look at you funny when you tell them Cincinnati has restaurants just for chili!  The amounts in the recipe are adjustable to taste, depending on how much beef you use, but it seems to come out perfectly every time. It must be the spice combination!

My fiance is from Cincinnati and loves Skyline so I decided to surprise him and make this.  I followed others reviews and boiled the meat in the broth.  I also didn't cook the onions- I put raw onions/cheese on top of the chili like they do at Skyline.  I'm not a fan of Cincinnati chili, but I thought this recipe was pretty good.  My fiance thought it was great and it reminded him of home.

Absoutely loved this recipe! This is the "real deal" without the MSG that gives me palpatations!  I made exactly as the recipe states, with low sodium beef broth and a really fine mince on the onion.  I added about two teaspoons of kosher salt, too.  Perfect consistency, great taste, thanks, Holly!

Excellent recipe, very similar to Skyline Chili. The only difference to me was that it was thicker than Skyline Chili, but that could easily be resolved with the addition of perhaps another cup of beef broth. I will try it that way next time, could even stir it in at the end if it's too thick. But the flavor was just like that of Skyline Chili, with the same essence of spices and flavors. Perfect for coney dogs or served five-way, our favorite, over spaghetti, with canned red kidney beans, cheese and onions on top. I did cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/4 tsp since Skyline Chili isn't supposed to be spicy whatsoever. If you want to add spice to Skyline Chili, you add the bottle of hot sauce at the table, similar to Tabasco. Not via cayenne pepper. Loved this recipe tho!

We love Cincinnati Chili, and this recipe is very close to the seasoning packets I used to be able to find in stores.  This was an easy recipe, and turned out perfect.  I made it for my husband's family who had never heard of Cincinnati Chili and it was  real hit!  My only advice would be to double the recipe and freeze half!

I cooked this chili for a couple friends and my husband and they all said it was good. It's definitely a unique flavor. Hubby and I decided this is very much a cold, winter day chili or a rainy afternoon chili, something like that. The spices make it taste almost like something you'd eat around the holidays. I really wanted chili that night, so I didn't let it sit, but there's more leftover and hubby and I are eagerly waiting to see how much better it is when the flavors have time to meld together. The few changes I made were, I didn't put onions in, I served them as topper choice. I used one lb gr.beef and one lb gr.pork, because that's what I had. I added the extra tbsp of cinnamon I saw a lot of people recommend, and I also used 3 tbsp cocoa powder instead of a block of baking cocoa because again, that's all I had. The last change was probably partially my fault. I picked the biggest stockpot in my kitchen to make this in because my normal chili has a lot of things in it that make it come up very high in the pot, so after it started simmering, a lot of the liquid was coming off and I got worried it was going to burn because it wasn't very deep at all in the pot. I added a 29 ounce can of crushed tomato about 20 minutes before it was done, to get some liquid in there. Even with all these changes, I think I still got a good idea of how this was supposed to taste. Definitely a hearty chili, and not spicy at all. I'm glad I went ahead and made the spaghetti to go with it (even

GREAT!!!!!  Can't wait to make this for my family when they visit.  Never have been a chili fan, but this has changed my mind.  Although it doesn't need the beans, my kids even like it when I add a can or two.

I've made this several times for my family after our local Chili resturant folded.  It was the only placed to get Cincinnati Chili and this recipe is very close to theirs.  My daughter and I like to make Frisco pie with this chili.  Put corn chips in a bowl, spoon hot chili over the top and add sharp cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  The best!  Try it.

We love this!  (As other reviews have stated..much better the day after.)  
Also...as other cooks have suggested, I boil my beef first!  That step is essential in getting the true texture of chili! (take it from this cincinnati girl)
This recipe is so tasty!

I made the mistake of not paying attention to the recipe details..I used two 15-ounce cans of broth instead of the 10.5-ounce cans as specified in the recipe. (Later I checked a few stores...no 10.5-ounce cans!)  So the chili came out too soupy and I had to try again. And even though I'm an Ohio girl, I actually prefer the texture of browning the meat first like the recipe suggests.

This recipe really surprised me!  It looked so unusual, with the chocolate and the spices, that I just had to try it, but I wasn't sure how much I'd like it.  The first night, I thought it was edible but not great.  My husband liked it but thought it was weird to put chili on spaghetti.  Then the next morning I woke up craving it!  (Must be the chocolate!)  I had another helping and liked it better, although I still wasn't sure.  Then we had it for dinner and I loved it!  My husband had it with cheese sandwiches and liked that better than the spaghetti, although I'm sticking with the spaghetti and cheese.  I do have a few minor complaints that dropped my star rating to 4.  The chili seemed too thin originally; I wound up adding some cornstarch and simmering uncovered to let some of the water boil off.  The chili powder is too strong for me.  Next time I'll try cutting it in half and maybe increasing some of the other spices.  I also think it's a bit of a pain to refrigerate overnight, but since I liked it so much better the next day, the refrigeration is probably worth it.  Then again, maybe I just had to try it a few times to get used to it!

Having lived in Columbus, OH, for 3 years now, it's been hard to avoid Cincy-style chili! Once I got past the fact that it is completely different to the more traditional chunky variety (with or without beans), I'm now really quite partial to it. I use cocoa powder instead of chocolate (that's what I have on hand), and I also omit the allspice (don't like it). Also, though I halve the recipe, I end up using the whole can of tomato sauce to keep it nice and moist. We have it Skyline-style, over spagetti, topped with diced onion and grated Cheddar cheese. It's also great in hotdogs. Thanks, Holly!(PS, those people who are looking for a more traditional style chili might want to check out 'Justin's Hoosier Daddy Chili' on this site. Awesome!)

I've been having a craving for this stuff.  I lived in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area for seven years and would dine out at one of the local "Chili Parlors" regularly. (Skyline being my favorite).  My son and I really enjoyed this recipe.  This goes great with Cincinnati style Coney Island hotdogs, too.  Thanks a lot.

With some tweaking (too vinegary until I added extra sugar, chili powder, and water) this was a huge hit.  No left overs.  :)  I served it with chili beans, cheese, and onions over spaghetti.

This was not the Cincinnati Chili recipe I had been searching for.  It's okay...edible...and will suffice as Cincinnati Chili...but somehow, disappointing.

My 8 yr old son saw a program on Food network that showed Cincinatti style chili. We thought it looked so good since we never had it that way. This is a great recipe! I don't think we will eat chili the way we are used to having it!

Pretty good. Suprprisingly kid-friendly, even though it has a little "bite"! Its another style of chili, served over pasta with cheddar cheese. My husband isnt a big chili eater so didnt enjoy this much but the kids and I indulged. Served with Corn fritters! I liked this.

This recipe might be too spicy for children, but you never know! It is a delicious recipe! I used a can of diced Italian style tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and I also added 1 cup of V8 juice. I also added finely chopped celery, green pepper and mushrooms. I reduced the beef broth by 1/2 cup and substituted with perked coffee.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and boiled my beef in the broth for approx. 1 hour and then gave it a few quick buzzes with the immersion blender to achieve the right consistency, then followed the rest of the recipe to the letter, served over spaghetti with chili beans, chopped onions, shredded cheddar, oyster crackers and hot sauce on the side. A PERFECT 5 way, and totally worth all of the prep time, including the chilling overnight. My fiance had never had Cincinnati Chili before and was a little skeptical, but one bite and he was hooked!

My husband loves spicy foods.  I prefer less heat and more flavors.  Either way, this combination of flavors was not for us.  Being it way our first time making this, I followed the recipe to a "t", with the exception of boiling the meat.  We are not from the East coast.  I believe it must be an acquired taste because there are so many great reviews.

I make a knockoff version that is really close to this, as we are Cincy natives currently living in Germany and we need our Skyline fix;) the changes I make are to use cocoa powder in the place of the chocolate bar, and to just throw the hamburger, onions, and beef stock in the pot to brown together (don't drain; I recommend a leaner hamburger;) then once browned, add the rest of the ingredients and simmer until the consistency desired. I also put the chili in a blender and blend for like 5-7 seconds to get the consistency of the restaurant: smooth and without chunks! PS: onions are needed in the recipe as well as put on top along with tons of shredded cheese and oyster crackers!!

My husband has craved Cincinnati chili ever since he went to school there. He claims this taste very similar to the real thing and asks for this meal often. Great spin on a comfort food!

used 3 T cocoa mix in lieu of chocolate
used extra cinnamon, and didn't use cayenne pepper,  I like spice, but it was spicy enough.   Added one can of pinto beans.   Next time I will add two cans either pinto or kidney.   Overall great flavors and I would make again.

My son worked at Skyline for a while.  One thing, though, that I didn't realize that Skyline does for those of you making the Chili Spaghetti is that they put oil and tomato paste in their spaghetti.  Odd, I know, but if you're ever at Skyline, look at the spaghetti.  It's got a red tint to it.  As if you didn't need more grease to go along with the cheese and the boiled, undrained beef.  You have to add some oil and some tomato paste to the spaghetti for the true effect.  Plus, very finely shredded cheese (which can be hard to find).  The finer, the better on the cheese.

I strongly agree with all the previous reviewers that said in order for this to be a "true," genuine Cincinnati chili, you mustn't brown the meat, instead, boil it raw in the broth and chop it into tiny pieces with a spatula. Usually, diced onion is added as a condiment to the finished dish. I happen to love onions, so I'll grate ½ a sweet vidalia onion into a bowl with a box grater. I add it to the simmering beef and it dissolves into the broth. Also, never drain the boiled beef in a sieve to discard the fat. You'll lose the flavor! Instead, refrigerate the finished chili as instructed and you can peel the hardened sheet of excess fat off the top with a spoon.
Genuine Cincy chili is finely textured, like a pasta sauce. It's not supposed to be a chunky stew like Texas chili. With a few, very minor adjustments, this recipe is perfect! Thanks Marbalet!

Items missing from recipe as published:
MUST include salt (~1tsp or to taste)
MUST drain fat from cooked meat

Make those two simply alterations and you'll have fantastic Cincinnati style spaghetti sauce.

Wonderful.  So different than TX chili, and I personally prefer the flavor.

The only changes I made were to halve the recipe and increase the cinnamon and chili powder.  But those changes are not necessary. 

Great recipe.  Thank you!

VERY close to Skyline Chili... the taste is perfect.  I have read some people say the texture is off.  The trick for that is to use an immersible blender when you are nearly done with the chili (pull out the bay leaf first).  Then the texture is good too!

Being from the east coast, I didn't even know what Cincinnati chili was until I had it at Hard Times (local DC area chain).  I was never really a fain of chili in general until I tried their Cincinnati style chili.  It was so good that I went to look up how to make it myself.   And on my second attempt I found this recipe.  I boil the beef in the broth first like another reviewer has stated.  Then I add everything else and simmer for a couple hours.  It's been absolutely awesome each time.  I love making this recipe, and I now actually have found a type of chili I like.

Delicious flavor, I think the vinegar and Worchestershire added a lot to this.  I would decrease the salt a little bit next time though, but overall, this is the best Cincy chili I have made! I know the onions in the chili aren't exactly "authentic", but I love them.

Made this again with ground turkey, and boiled instead of browning.  Makes a big difference with the texture (or so I am told, I have never had "real" Cincinnati Chili, only the frozen Skyline stuff.  Also, you need WAY more cheese for this.  Otherwise, it's excellent.

The flavor is spot on!!!! To get the right texture, do as other reviewers have done and simmer the beef in water to brown, and then drain. This makes the pasty consistency. Also, no unsweetened chocolate squares, subbed 1T of cocoa powder. Thanks! Great!!!!!

I thought this was very good.  It tasted very similar to the Cincinnati Chili I have had before.  My dh hated it, however.  He thought it was an offence to all things Italian to serve chili over pasta!  I ended up freezing the leftovers in smaller batches and I am using it up by throwing a bag in when I make regular chili.  If not for my silly dh, I would make again!;-)

I am originally from Cincy who has relocated. I missed Skyline in the grocery stores after I moved. I discovered this recipe and to my suprise, it comes VERY close to Skyline Chili. I love it! And it isn't that difficult!!

I thought this recipe was great.  I've never been a fan of traditional style chili.   This one is a keeper.   Will difinately make it again.

Obviously it's just a matter of taste, but I did not care for this at all. The cinnamon was just too overpowering, and out of place in chili. No one else cared for it, either. I'm sure it's a great recipe, but not anything I would make again.

I used ground turkey instead of beef because we do not eat a lot of red meat in my household and added a bit of habenero for more heat.  The recipe seemed like it was missing something, so I added a bit of sea salt and garlic powder- that seemed to do the trick.  Served over gemelli garnished with cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  It was delicious and I got tons of compliments from my guests.   I will definitely make again with the slight variation.

I boiled the beef like others had suggested, and I think it worked out really well.  I have made this twice since finding this recipe, and doubled it the second time because the first time I made it, it was gone too quick!  Be sure not to over do the onion though, I think I added too much last time, the amount in the recipe is perfect!

This was alright. I have never had cincinnati chili before, but the recipe really intrigued me. I made it as written (other than the cloves b/c I don't have any) and I didn't eat it on spaghetti, just by itself topped with onion and cheddar cheese. I think it would be good on cornbread. Anyway, if I make it again, I will follow some of the other reviewers suggestions about boiling the meat and will eat it over spaghetti.

This was a big hit with my family. I followed the recipe fairly closely except that I replacedbeef with pork and increased spices a smidge. It tasted pretty close to the Skyline Chili my husband and I used to get, way back when.

I substituted turkey for beef, and it was honestly the best Cincinnati style chili recipe I've ever had or fixed.  This takes the tastes of "Skyline" chili to the next level.  Truley great!

SOOOOO good! I reviewed this before but wanted to give an update now that I have made it many times. I now use 2 lbs ground turkey and it tastes just as good as with beef and way more healthy. I also use 2 Tablespoons powdered chocolate instead of what it calls for. I also top it with sour cream, chopped seeded jalepenos, shredded cheddar, and chopped yellow onions. One of my favorite recipes from this website.

Every time I'd end up in the Cincy area I simply HAD to get to skyline. Moving further out west hasn't allowed frequent visits, however this recipe fed the craving just fine. I followed the suggestion made by another reviewer to boil the meat, yummmm!

Delicious.  I have made several different recipes for Cincinnati Chili and this was the best.  I did find that I had to gently boil it down for a bit, as there was a high liquid to meat ratio.

Hi Sue Porter!  Funny how I've never been in Cincy but love this chili, we all did.  Followed the recipe exactly and when I make it again I may use the crock pot and line it with a bag like Judy7905 suggested.  I love to serve it just like depicted, the whole family loved it.  We miss NC, Sue.  Say Hi to your family for us.

This recipe was so close to skyline chilli, we couldn't tell the difference.  I halved the chili powder, left out the cayenne pepper.  I also browned the beef with about 1/2 cup of beef broth in the pan with the beef first.

Changes I made:  I did not brown the meat or onion per other reviewers.  I added 50% more cinnamon and I cooked it in the crockpot all day.  OMG!  We loved this.  The spice mixture is perfect.  It tastes just like Skyline.  I wished I hadn't used a red onion for our 4th way.  It was close to overpowering.   Because others had textural issues, I asked the butcher to regrind my beef.  That worked very well and I may ask them to do that with a lot of my future ground beef purchases.  Also, I used a Reynolds Oven Bag to line my crockpot.  It worked beautifully but time will tell if we ingested anything toxic.  Oh, well.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  The closest restaurant who serves this style is ten miles away, so I'm sure I'll make it again.

Wow, you can't get much closer than this. I used beef broth instead of water and mixed all ingredients together(ground sirloin went in raw) and boiled for three hours- I used a total of 64 ounces of beef broth, I just kept adding it as it cooked down-then to get the texture just right i put it in a food processor for a quick spin-perfect. Also, I did not have any bay leaves on hand so i left them out, I couldn't taste any difference. NOTE: If you have never had Skyline chili, don't think of this as a chili, just give it a try. I served it on Spaghetti with lots of cheese and onion- classic four way!

I used the advice given in reviews to cook the meat in the broth and then added and simmered the rest of the ingredients.  It was very good and tastes pretty close to Skyline Chili, in my opinion.

Delicious!  This is an easy recipe and it definitely tastes better if you refrigerate over night and reheat the next day.  The flavors are very unique and need time to blend together.  We served over spaghetti with sour cream, shredded cheese, and a few Fritos. :)  A definite keeper!  Next time will try with ground turkey.

i really wanted to like this chili.  Everyone else seemed to...but eew.  I have never had skyline chili, nor heard of it...had to do a google search on it after reading this.  I was so excited and made it Saturday night, and refridgeratged overnight (did the whole recipe exactly as called for).  total sadness yesterday when i ate it.  I have never had the "infamous" skyline chili...still hope to someday so i can be proven wrong by the weird taste i had yesterday.  I had fun making it though!

This wasn't "bad", but just not my cup of tea.  Granted I didn't let it sit overnight and maybe that has something to do with it.. but probably won't be making again.

I have never been to Ohio. I'm a Southern California girl. All the sweetness stopped me from ever trying Cincinnati chili, but I went for it today. Yummy! Not as sweet as I expected. The only thing I did different was to add about 1 1/2 tsp of salt. That was it, the rest was to the letter. I tried it after simmering for an hour and it really needed salt. I am not sure if I "un-Cincinnati'd" it by the salt, if so, I hang my head in shame. But, I really liked it.

While this chili was cooking i was getting a little nervous about the cinnamon....that is all i could smell.....and I only put in half the amount called for...but when I finally got to try it the next day it was obvious why the cinnamon is a part of the recipe.....it adds just the right touch (although i will still use less next time).....excellent chili.....might even be better than my local chili chili spot!.....will make again and again...

I have never tried Cincinnati Chili before, so this was my first time making it.  My husband and most of our guests loved it.  For me personally, I wasn't crazy about the cinnamin, which I could taste more than I liked.  This is my taste buds, and not a reflection of the recipe, which I was assured by everyone was fantastic.  There is only a few spoonfuls left, so I will definitely recommend this recipe!  Thanks!

UPDATE:  Follow the posters advice...chili was fantastic the next day!  While I didn't much care for it last night when I made it, today is a totally different story!  The flavor is totally different than when it was first made.  I'm glad I had a little left over so that I could taste it 15 hours later...now I'm a fan!  Refrigerating overnight is definitely the secret to this recipe.

Loved this recipe. I was not brave enough to use the chocolate but will try it next time. I did add beans to mine. My husband is not a fan of spicy food so this one was right on for him. I will make over and over again.

Hubby said it tasted just like Skyline chili!  Taster beware-the 1/4 cup chili powder makes this pretty spicy.  I would make it again with 2-3 Tblsp of chili powder instead of the 4 the recipe calls for.

This was awesome. Definitly refridge overnight and reheat like any other chili. I used one can chicken broth and one Beef by accident, both cans looked alike. Came out great anyway.

Wow! This was great!  I had never heard of Cincinnati Chili before, and thought I'd give it a whirl.  We were floored by how good it was!  My 6 & 11 year olds (picky eaters both) cleaned their plates and took the leftovers in their thermos  for lunch today.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, but I may try cooking the meat with the broth as some others have suggested just to see how it turns out.  This is a recipe I see myself making again and again.

This was fabulous!  I used to live in Ohio and now I'm in Florida.  I've been missing Skyline and was very excited to try out this recipe.  It was just like I remembered it.  My husband loved it and is now requesting it once a week.  I didn't put onions in with the beef instead I left the option to put it on top.  I also boiled the beef in broth like I read on other reviews.  I served this on spaghetti and put cheese on top. I forget to get two things - Oyster crackers and York peppermint patties!

We add the ground beef to the cold water and bring to a boil, then add the seasonings, do not brown first.  The longer you cook it the better.
Serve with oyster crackers and Tobasco sauce.

Tastes like the Skyline I remember, if not better. (I always bought the seasoning packets and made my own when in Cincinnati.)  But my husband frequented the restaurant and agrees, the flavors in this recipe are all there.  However, this recipe does not call for nearly enough cheese.  Use at least 1/4 cup (measured before shredding) per serving.  Note: Cincinnati Chili does not have beans in it (unless you order a 5-way but I never tried that and the beans are an add-on, not an ingredient!)

Excellent.  It has been over 30 years since I lived in Cincy.  The taste and aroma of this recipe brought me right back.  Only, it was not Skyline Chili that was popular then -- it was Empress Chili parlor. I did not change anything in the recipe on my first round, but I ran a little short on chili powder.  Next time I will use the whole quarter cup.  This chili was definitely NOT too hot! And I am not tolerant of too much heat.

This recipe is what we've been looking for!  Moving away from Cinci has been hard, but leaving Skyline was even harder!  This recipe is great, and I've pre-packaged the dry ingregients for ease of use.  Works great.

My relatives used to live in Cincinnati, so I spent many summers there as a kid eating Cincinnati Chili-- Skyline in particular. This recipe satisfied my nearly ten-year craving--It tasted VERY close to the real thing. I added a little bit of brown sugar, and omitted the allspice. I also ended up accidentally leaving the lid off while it was simmering, and the liquid absorbed too quickly. So I added a little more broth and tomato sauce and it still turned out great. I ate it right away (I couldn't wait until the next day), and I think it was equally delicious both right away and the next day. Serve it topped with a lot of finely shredded cheddar, raw onions and oyster crackers...mmmm...This is a keeper.

I tweaked this recipe a bit, but after I did, I really liked it (so did DH and my toddler son, who is an adventurous eater), and I will definitely make it again! This is way better than regular chili. Served it over linguine with raw onions and sharp cheddar cheese. I cooked it down quite a bit to intensify the spices. 
My changes:
1) I used ground venison instead of ground beef
2) added 3 cloves of fresh crushed garlic
3) added extra cinnamon to taste, and a Tbs or so of brown sugar
4) I used a 29 oz can of tomato sauce, and only 15 oz of broth
5) Added an extra bay leaf, and 1 Tbs of cocoa powder in lieu of the chocolate
6) and finally, as another poster suggested, I browned the onions, then added the liquid, and then the ground meat, and this made the meat very fine and smooth.

This is REALLY good Chili - I live in ATLANTA and had been looking for Cincinnati style chili everywhere - now I have it.  I added 2 Tbs of Molasses, doubled the cinnimon and simmered it for 2 hours.  My boyfriend and I gobbled up huge plates of it over spaghetti with grated cheddar last night.  Today it's even better - will definitly make this for Superbowl Sunday!  THANKS

I had my wife's family over for dinner and they are all from Cincinnati and loved this chili!  Just as good as Skyline they said.  I simmered the chili for 3 hours the first day and then refrigerated over night and then simmered again for two hours before serving.  Had to get that great smell in the house before they showed up!

Update on my last posting. With this recipe and some slight tweaking, I won 2nd place in a Chili cook off against a bunch of Texas Chili's . I wanted to show up with something different because everyone was doing a Texan style chili and it paid off. Try this recipe! It's good!

I ate Skyline all the time growing up in Cincy.  This is pretty darn close. I used half the chili powder and cayenne and doubled the chocolate and added about a teaspoon or more of brown sugar.  I would use less cloves next time.  I browned the meat and chopped it fine with with my metal spatula then removed the fat - ready in about an hour.   Excellent!

I saw this recipe, and I just had to try it. Very unique! I made the base before adding the hamburger just in case I didn't like the flavor.  After adding a second can of tomatoe sauce and garlic pepper I was surprised how flavorful it was. There are a number of variations of this chili online, among  the ingredients they they had in common was the chocolate and cinnamon. I added the hamburger and cooked on low in crockpot.  Served with crackers and hard rolls. Very good, nice change from the basic chili recipes. My husband and son enjoyed it as well.

This was delish!! I didn't have the chocolate, broth or vinegar and I used equal amounts of tomato sauce to crushed tomato. On recommendation from a friend, I also added garlic powder, celery salt and marjoram in addition to the spices that the recipe called for. This is definately a keeper!

We thought this was outstanding and I have a picky teen.  Would recommend.  Funny thing is I printed this recipe 2 days ago, went and bought the ingredients and checked today to see what reveiwers suggestions were to see if I needed to make any changes.  There I saw Brenda's comments of yesterday.  Funny, when she lived in Raleigh her daughter Claire and my daughter Nicole played soccer together.  Small world and funny how the love of cooking brings you together again.  :)

Looooooooooove this! I did what others suggested and increased the spices except for chili pepper which I reduced. I also used onion powder with the meat instead of onions becuase we put raw onions on the top. I added a dollop of mollases to give it a sweetness and will definitely be making this again!

Being from cincinnati i love this recipe.  Though another idea thats a huge hit for the kids at their school parties, or even a great snack; is the chili dip.  Only difference hold the onions, and chill in bakers pan for about 1 1/2hrs. Then before serving top with sour cream and mound with cheese. Serve with nacho chips and there you have the SKYLINE CHILI CHEESE DIP. YUM!!

Was taken aback by how strong the cinnamom and clove taste came through. I will  omit them next time. Also, see no need for the chocolate.

My husband grew up in Ohio and loves skyline chili. I have been looking for a recepie that comes close to theirs and I think I have found it! He absolutley loved it! I did blend the meat in the blender, just for a second, and refrigerating it overnight is a MUST!!! I will make this time and time again!!!

Our family didn't like this at all. The cheese and pasta help to mute the flavor of the chili but it tastes too similar to Indian food without being good. This got such high reviews that I tried to make myself like it but my husband had no qualms telling me how terrible it was. Obviously a lot of people like it which is why I tried it but I had to post a bad review so that someone perhaps wouldn't waste there time as we felt we did. I don't know what made us not like it but I think there was just too much going on. It's a very heavy meal.

My husband is from Cinci so I couldn't wait to make this recipe. It is really close to the chili parlor chili and so good the next day. We had it over spaghetti the first time and then made chili dogs the next day. Delicious.

We tried this chili in Cincinnati and couldn't figure out why people liked it. Then...we proceeded to eat it two more times in the next 24 hours. What makes it so addictive? This recipe is spot-on with the chili we had in Cinci. My wife made it last week and we ate it every night. In fact, on Wed. night she had to gently tell me that it was time to stop eating! Thanks for the great recipe. -- TLL's hubby  (Boiled the meat in the broth as others suggested. Turned out perfect.)

This was wonderful!!  I was skeptical at first, but it was as close to Skyline Chili as you could get at home.  I omitted the bay leaf and the allspice only because I didn't have any on hand.  Next time, I will try it that way.  I also used less chili powder due to the kids.  Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!  Now, we can have Skyline even when we don't go back home to Indy.

I've never had real Cincinnati Chili, but I loved this recipe.  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so I added a small can of tomato paste along with a can of diced tomatoes.  I didn't have beef broth either so I used water.  I used 50% more cinnamon and a bit of extra chili powder as well.  I also added some garlic.  It was a big hit at our house with our kids (3 and 5 years old) and my husband and I.  YUM.  The first night we had it with polenta, tonight we're having it with the recommended spaghetti and cheese.  Can't wait!

Great chili! The combination of spices is fabulous!
I cut the chili powder by half and boiled the beef and onions with 1 can of broth (beef or chicken) + 1 can of water. I then used a hand blender to chop the meat into tiny pieces. This gives the chili a smooth, rich consistency.

I really wanted to like this recipe but there was something missing that I cannot put my finger on. I would make it again if I could figure out what was missing. My husband did not care for it at all, he likes Texas style chili better.

My husband and I love Cincinatti Chili and love everything about this recipe except for the amount of chili powder it calls for. We reduced the amount to an eighth of a cup and it was still so hot I couldn't finish one plate of it. My husband and I love hot spicy foods but this was too much for us. Maybe we used a more potent chili powder!

I've never been to Cincinnati so I can't say how it compares to the "real thing" but I can say that my husband I really enjoyed this chili.  I used 1lb grnd turkey and added 1 extra can of tomato sauce and used only 1 can of low sodium beef stock.  I also add some brown sugar.  I cooked it in the slow cooker.  We at it with spaghetti, cheese,and sour cream.  My husband added some jalepeno chilies for some extra kick.  I will be making this again.

Thank you Holly for this great recipe!  I have made this multiple times, and we love it. I usually omit or only use a sprinke of the cayenne pepper, to spicy for us with the amount called for.  I also don't cook with the onions but save them for the top.

This was very good but I used a 1/2 Tbsp of cocoa instead of chocolate, 1 tbsp of vinegar and 1/2 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  I also mixed in one minced clove of garlic with the onion. My hubby liked it better than my mother in laws. Ha! He's a native Buckeye so he knows Cincy chilli.

This chili has a unique, delicious spicy (though not with fire) flavor.  Be sure to strain off the grease before adding the spices.

I wanted to give this recipe 5 stars but my husband eats Skyline all the time and only gave it 4 stars. I didn't add Bay leaf and I put the meat in the blender to make it very fine. I thought it was AMAZING! I ate mine with hot sauce and oyster crackers. We'll definitely be eating this again! Thanks Holly!

This unusual flavored chili is awesome!  The unique combination of spices and that it is served on spaghetti make it a whole new flavor sensation!  A must-try for any and all chili fans!

This was a very good recipe, quite flavorful.  I added in the last 30 minutes of simmering quartered mushrooms and sliced green and red bell pepper.  I topped it with diced tomatoes also.  Very very good!

Wonderful recipe.  I read it wrong and didn't have time to refridgerate overnight so it was a little thin.  However we ate the whole pot so I couldn't check the next day!  Added beans as a topping.  Wonderful flavor served with corn fritters!!  Ym

I wouldn't know anything about whether this is authentic or not (having lived all my life in Iowa), but it is EXCELLENT!  I can't say enough about how incredibly tasty it is.  Cheddar cheese and sour cream liven it up a lot, and I served it over brown rice.

I made this chili on the stove and transferred it to a crockpot on low for 5 hours and it was TERRIBLE!  I make all my chili in a crockpot (never Cincinnati style chili) and I have never had a chili that didn't taste better the longer it is allowed to simmer but this was unedible.  I LOVE Cincinnati style chili but this tasted nothing like any I have ever had including Skyline.  I will not make this again.

Okay, I didn’t make this to directions.  I do love this recipe, however, It’s only half of my ‘contest winning’ chili.  I mix these ingredients along with my 94yr old dad’s west Texas chili recipe.  It’s a fantastic combo!

A family favorite, often served over spaghetti squash.

I tend to double the spices, for a little more zing.

This recipe is ok,  but you don't brown the hamburger, you boil it.   You don't add onion either.  It is always served with raw chopped onion.  :)  The spices are right though.

While visiting with relatives in Cincinnati Ohio we experienced this chili.  We have tried different recipes and this one is by far the best!  I measure all the seasonings first and put them in one bowl.  it makes it easier.  After browning the meat and onions, I drain it. It turns out better this way.  If you use really lean ground beef you might not have to though.  This recipe is delicious and is always requested by family and friends.

I took some advice from other reviewers and added another 50% chili powder and cinnamon. I cooked the onions and beef in beef broth before putting it into my slow cooker. I added 3 cans of beans (2 dark kidney beans and 1 light kidney beans) as well. I can't wait to try it!!!

This turned out great.  Did not have semi-sweet chocolate so I used a Hershey bar .  Added a little more heat and twice the cinnamon.  I am used to Tex-Mex style chili so this was different for me but I really liked it.  Will make again.

I am from Cincinnati.  My momma used to make this a lot.  I do not have her recipe but this is close, but not exact.  I plan to use this as a start tonight though.  You boil the beef while chopping it up, not chunks.  No onions in chili either.  You use whole allspice.  We always put in red kidney beans as well.  I'll try the tomato sauce I don't think we ever used it.  Double the cinnamon for sure, and 1/4 the garlic.  I'll let you know when I make it.

My husband's family is from Cincinnati and I've grown to love "Skyline" as much as they do! A tip I would add is too boil the ground beef in beef broth vs browning it. It breaks up into a much finer consistency.

I do not brown the beef instead I boil it in the broth, then I use 3 tbsp cocoa if making a full batch, rather than chocolate. Up the cinnamon and chili powder, leave out the cooked onions (add raw on top).

This recipe was so easy to make and exceptionally delicious. 

I subbed out the chili powder and cayenne with two freshly roasted and ground Indian red chilies.  Also freshly roasted and ground ground the cumin, cloves and (added) coriander seeds.  I also subbed out canned Italian-style diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce and added a bunch of fresh chopped basil that I had laying around. 

The recipe was very forgiving of substitutions and outrageously tasty.

Okay so I've been making this recipe for a few years, and I've had the real Skyline chili several times.  The first thing you really need is a stick blender/immersion blender.  Once the ground beef and onions are cooked, drain the fat and then buzz them up till they are all a fine almost pasty consistency.  No chunks.   I use regular old ground beef instead of lean beef so it's cheaper but there's quite a bit of fat that has to be drained.  Also, not a big difference between using bakers chocolate and regular old hersheys or other semi sweet chocolate, so just use what  you have on hand.  Using a semi sweet chocolate instead of bakers chocolate does make it slightly sweeter but in the big scheme of things it's not much of a difference at all.  

Also, thickness is important.  It needs to be a little runny, so as it thickens up on you then add some water to thin it out so it pours onto your spaghetti.  

You could do it the old fashioned way and boil the meat for hours etc till it breaks down, but I prefer browning it and hitting it with the immersion blender real quick, same result

Never had Cincinnati chili at Skyline or the other vaunted chili parlors, but authentic or not, this is a delicious recipe. Had it 5 ways. Doubled the spice mixture to have a batch ready to go next time.

Just the way I remember it from Cincinnati. We don't have this at all on the West Coast, and it's nice to be able to make it.

There are so many reviews it could make your head spin, but we did a good sampling of them to find the best method.  We boiled the beef in broth, adding water as it evaporates over time.  Boiled for 2 hours seemed best (we made this twice in 3 days).  Chopped onion was only for garnish.  We used 1 1/2 TBSP of unsweetened chocolate powder.  We added garlic powder, onion powder and a little black pepper.  Served over #3 Melissa.  It's a Slovenian?  or Greek? or Bosnian? pasta that is like a huge, hollow spaghetti.  You can find at ethnic markets.

Did anyone have issues with thickness of this recipe? I found it to be very soup like (thin) not thick at all.  Any suggestions for thickening it after it's already made?

I've actually made this a number of times. It's incredible, but I boil the beef in beef stock instead of brown it. ALMOST as good as Skyline.

The flavor was pretty close. I used a teaspoon and half of both cumin and cinnamon.  If you want the texture to be right you do brown the beef.

As a native Ohioan, this is the best homemade Cincinnati chili I've ever made. Much better than what you can make even using spice packets from Gold Star or Skyline. 

As others have said: Don't brown the meat. Boil it in the beef broth -- it really makes a difference. If you're worried about the fat, use lean ground meat or even turkey.

Some alterations I made that others might like:
-- My family doesn't like raw onions, so I minced about half a cup of white onion and added it to the beef broth while boiling the meat. It adds a bit of the onion flavor, but disappears into the finished chili without affecting the smooth texture.
-- I added 50% more cinnamon, as others suggested. I didn't add significantly more chili powder, but did use rounded scoops.  I prefer to add the spices while the meat is boiling down. Really concentrates the flavor.
--I skipped the cayenne, as we don't like it spicy.
-- I stir in a 15 oz can of pinto or pink beans for the last 30 minutes of cook time. It's just convenient when you're eating the batch over a couple of days.
--Add the chocolate as the last step, so it melts but doesn't boil.

time-consuming to make, but unique and delicious! i also followed the other reviewers' suggestion to only boil the meat, not brown it (they seemed to know what they were talking about), and used the 3 T cocoa powder instead of chocolate. it turned out great! husband loved it.

Spices like whole cloves, whole allspice, and bay leaf can be place in an old fashioned tea seaper to keep from bitting into them. The chocolate was new for me(a little different).

The only ingredient I didn't have was the unsweetened chocolate, I used semi sweet chocolate instead.
We visit my wifes grandmother who lives in Cincinnati every year and this chili brings me back there whenever I make it.
Thanks for the great recipe

Yeah, do not brown the beef. I boiled in water, then strained it and added the beef broth and cooked it down from there and then added all the ingredients. I did add more cinnamon.  Not exactly skyline or goldstar, but close enough!

Unique flavor - very tasty and different.  I live in Texas (love Texas chili)  and this does not taste anything like the chili here.   I was surprised by the comments to boil the hamburger meet for two hours ahead of time.  I did that and increased the cinnamon as other reviewers stated.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.   My boyfriend took the leftovers home with him so he must have liked it.   I would recommend draining the beef after the boiling process.  I did not as I was afraid of losing some of the flavor.  It definitely would have been better to drain it as I ended up skimming the grease off the chili before serving.

Browning the meat is the correct way to go, I think.  Simply boiling meat from raw is not a good culinary practice.

My wife can not eat beef, so I substituted ground pork and chicken broth for the beef broth. Added some Mushrooms chopped fine and a can of tomatoe paste, doubled the amount of onion. Everyone in the family hates it when I make chili.... And I make really good chili! This recipe with changes has my family raving about Cincinnati Chili. It's not the hot chili I've made but they love it!

I listened to other reviews and boiled the meat first. We left out onions but topped with onions, cheese, sour cream and oyster crackers and served over spaghetti noodles. Hubbie and boys loved it; "5 stars PLUS!" The girls and I didn't think it was bad, we just weren't as excited.

Decent, but not a do-again.  We tried it with spaghetti the first time, and elbow macaroni with the leftovers.  Macaroni was an improvement.  The chili had a weird, greasy aftertaste -- to be fair, I did use cheap beef.

A very good recipe.  I loved the flavor of this chili.  To add more "kick" to it, try adding hot sauce.  We also served this with sour cream.

I grew up with this dish called three ways. My dad was from Cincinnati so i say this is a real dish of the City. We would just get a good brand of canned chili or left over chili and go from there. It is always yummy.

I can't speak to authenticity, but this chili is delicious. The first time I made it I mixed up my spice jars and added 1/4c of cayenne - oops!! I had to double everything else to make it edible. Since then I double the *actual* cayenne this calls for and it has a nice kick, but doesn't kick you in the face like that first batch.

This was awesome!  Great flavor and the aroma just filled the house.  I would recommend degreasing the sauce before serving.

I have never tried Skyline chili, but it is one of my husband's favorites. I did not tell him anything except that I made chili. In between shoving the chili in as fast as he could he told me that this chili tasted "just like Skyline chili". He was in heaven!!! He and my son could not get enough. The only thing that stopped them from the third helping was their full bellies!. Great recipe that made me the hero of the night!!!!! Thanks.

This was...different.  I've been eyeing this recipe for months and finally got up the courage to try it.  I boiled the meat per other reviewers but then followed the rest exactly. It was good!  Just very different (but I've never ventured very far from N. Florida).  My taste buds are just very confused...lol.

very accurate!! do boil the meat with the spices vs. browning it first separately... also, on a whim, i cooked up some chicken corn dogs and then poured the chili over them with cheddar cheese and it was a HIT!!!

MUST be served over noodles to be good. Like the spices and the chocolate, just not the texture. For stand alone chili, add beans and vegies.

My roommate went to college at Cincinnati Christian University and ate this a lot.  I  tried it and it was different.  Good, but different.  My roommate said this was like Skyline.  He loved it!  I will make it again for some Ohioans at church.

I loved this recipie.. I added a bag of presoaked red beans and threw the whole thing in crock pot on high overnight..I used 2 large cans of chopped tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and one large whole onion. I waited to add the beef stock last and just filled the pot to the top and plugged in.. I wasn't sure by the way it smelled but after refrigerating and reheating I got very excited....  can't wait to do it again..

This tasted exactly like the chili back home (in Cincinnati).  I live in England for now and it really gave me a sense of home.  I ate it for three days straight.

This recipe is fantastic.  I had never experienced Cincinnati Chili before, but judging by the recipe, it has become a alltime family favorite.  The hint of chocolate makes it over the top!

This was delicious and close to Skyline chili from what I remember.  I am from Ohio and I haven't had it for about 3 years.  Instead of 1/2 square of unsweetened chocolate, I used 1 Tbls of unsweetened cocoa powder.  I used vegetable broth + 3 tsp beef boullion instead of beef broth.  I used soy burger crumbles instead of the beef.  It all turned out delicious and just enough spice for us!

This chili was just not something my husband or I really cared for. I agree with the other reviewers who said you either love it or hate it. There really isn't any inbetween. It just isn't something our tastes are used to I guess.

We tried this and my family just didn't care for it too much. I am not saying it was horribly bad or that it needed this or that, I think we just aren't Cincinnati Chili lovers like many who have posted on here. We will continue to look further for something more to our liking.

i grew up in Alabama, not knowing Cinci chili..wow! i omitted one of the cans of beef broth, and also the all-spice. i also added a touch of garlic, worcheshire, and an amazing spice called Garam Masala.it is soooo worth it!!!

Everyone in my family loved this chili, especially the kids! I served it on top of whole wheat spaghetti. I changed it to a 12-serving recipe, though and the proportions added too much broth. 1 1/2 cans would have been enough.

Easy to make, and pretty tasty. I probably should have let it boil off some more moisture before serving, since I tend to perfer a thicker dish to go with pasta.

This recipe is very tasty and received rave reviews from my co-workers at the latest potluck!!  I added one can of drained and rinsed kidney beans 1/2 hour before done.  I also recommend topping with sour cream along with the shredded cheddar cheese - it even makes it more yummy!! Thanks for sumitting this recipe!!

I wouldn't make this chili all the time but it was a really nice change from what I usually make. I didn't want to eat it with spaghetti though so I added a can of kidney beans. It has such an interesting taste to it. I absolutely HATE the smell of it and when I was making it I was scared it would be disgusting because of the smell but I was pleasantly surprised! I will definitely keep this recipe!

This was O.K. but I don't think I will make it again. While the cocoa gives it a greater depth of flavors, I almost found it to be to intense (out of all the flavors and spices, it dominated), only softened by topping with cheddar and sour cream. My chili was cooking very thick so I added some beer to it as well.

I made this and 2 other chilis for lunch for the office and it received rave reviews!  I had requests for a meatless chili, a regular chili and a beanless chili and this one went the fastest!  I did add a pound more ground beef to it and probably a cup more beef broth (I doubled the recipe)  It came out perfect.  Thanks Holly!

My family loves this recipe over pasta with sour cream, cheddar cheese and raw onion.  Delicious and different!

I skipped the chocolate accidentally, but really enjoyed the results.  It needed a bit more seasoning for my taste.

SOOOO HAPPY with this recipe.  it is, as all the other reviewers have said, THE REAL THING.  even my california bred husband loves this recipe.  you just have to know that it isn't your normal chili.

Truly authentic Cincinnati-style chili!  The only changes I made were to uncover pot for last half hour and add 1  teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken.

It was fantastic! The cayenne gave it some zip and the cloves, cinnamon, and chocolate gave it some sweet. A keeper recipe!
