Great idea!  Tried as soon as I got this recipe. This is really tasty.  I made acouple as written and then added poultry seasoning and fresh sage to the next ones.  Both were very good.

This recipe caught my eye, but to be honest I wasn't really enthusiastic about it and it sat in my recipe box for quite a while before I actually made a point of trying it.  It sounded like a good base recipe, but I was expecting my review to say "it needed something extra".  Well, I finally made them tonight and all I can say is WOW! I was very pleasantly surprised that this simple burger ended up being very tasty and unique.  Only changes were to add a clove of garlic to the onions and celery and a little poultry seasoning (Bell's) and some dried thyme to the meat, and I used egg whites (from the carton) in place of whole eggs.   I scaled this recipe down to three burgers, using about a half pound of turkey. The burgers were so moist and delicious, and although I expected to want "something else" to pep up the cranberry sauce and cream cheese, the two toppings really worked well together, and complimented the flavors of the stuffing mix and turkey without overpowering them.  A wonderful recipe, and one that I will make again and again! Thanks, Hez!

I made this for dinner tonight- I only had 1 lb of ground turkey and no celery.  I used one egg and 3 oz of stuffing.  Excellent!  My family loved it and we will be eating it again soon!

This was really good. My favorite sandwich is turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. I think next time I make this I want to make it as a meatloaf and use a cranberry glaze on top. thanks for the recipe!

I tried this as a meatloaf. Added the poultry season and sage. Also made a cream of mushroom gravy. It was the bomb. I dont rate recipes because everyone has their own taste but, I have to say this is a great idea. Thanks for sharing it!!!

I didn't think these were especially Thanksgiving-flavored, but they were still delicious. I would never have thought to put whipped cream cheese on a burger, but it was really good, especially with the cranberry sauce. We will make these again.

Very good!   Used extra lean ground turkey ...sauteed red onion and celery in olive instead of butter.  Also added turkey stuffing mix. And to make it better added about 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning,  sage, and dried thyme.  Very Thanksgiving -y tasting. Thanks for a tasty turkey burger!

We thought these were really good - definitely had a strong"Thanksgiving" flavor!   I made exactly as the recipe stated and served on wheat buns.  We weren't crazy about the cream cheese though.  Next time I will try with a whole berry cranberry aoli.

I made these for dinner tonight.  Good, but not exciting.  I'd make them again if I had the ingredients on hand, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to make them.  Not crave-able.

I gave this a four star rating even though I probably will not make this often.  Basically the toppings- whipped cream cheese and cranberry really make this dish.  If you plan on skipping those items, the wow faxtor will be much less.  The burger with toppings is a nice way to get your Turkey Day cravings satisfied any time of the year!

I made the turkey burger but did not top with the cranberry & cream cheese because we don't like cranberries.  This may be the reason why I didn't care for this recipe.  My family likes stuffing so we were very dissapointed that we couldn't even taste it in the burger.

This was really good, my family enjoyed this made with sweet potatoes on the side. Nice alternative to our standard hambugers.  The only thing that I left out was the whip cream.  I forgot to buy the whipped cream cheese.

Great idea for a fun Thanksgiving livingroom picnic in April! I followed the recipe for the burger as written, only adding black pepper and poultry seasoning. I decided at the last minute to make a little turkey gravy for the topping, to go along with the cranberry and cream cheese. Yum. We had these on onion rolls - with sweet potato wedges, green beans, and pumpkin muffins. Thanks for the recipe! Happy Thanksgiving. :)

Really tasty. I used a cornbread stuffing mix and didn't use any butter to saute veggies. Added poultry seasoning and served this with some sauted broccoli slaw, along with the cream cheese and cranberry sauce. I'll make this again

Yum!  These tasted just the way I imagined they would and hoped they would.  Unfortunately I am on a temporary dairy-free diet so I sauteed the onions/celery in oil and replaced the cream cheese with mayo.  It was still great but I look forward to trying this again when I can enjoy the butter and cream cheese!  What a great idea for something different for dinner!

Excellent tasting turkey burger. Tastes like Thanksgiving, for sure. Followed the recipe exactly,except, I added a little poultry seasoning. We really enjoyed it. My boyfriend didn't like the cream cheese and cranberry sauce on it. I loved it with them.

These were so good! A favorite restaurant serves these and these turned out very close! I made some changes; I halved the recipe, did not saute onions and celery, used turkey-flavored stuffing mix, added a dash of sage, and mixed craisins in with the meat/stuffing. Also cooked these on the stove due to the season. They turned out great!

These were fabulous burgers!!  I used pepperidge farm herbed stuffing mix and added just a touch of sage to the meat mixture.  I topped only with mayo as I didn't have the other items on hand!  Can't wait to try with the cranberry!  Made Carolyn's sweet potato fries from this site as a side and had apple ale to drink. Awesome summertime thanksgiving feast!

By all means, make this recipe! The only changes I made were to use less butter to cook the onion and celery, and I use light cream cheese (NOT fat-free which is a salty, terrible trade-off). Whole berry cranberry sauce rocks- I stir it right into the cream cheese. PINK and also delicious on ordinary turkey sandwiches!

I didn't love this but the rest of my family went crazy over it. For a turkey burger, it was incredibly moist and easy to make. As someone else mentioned, it doesn't taste like Thanksgiving - the stuffing is there but barely discernible in taste. I would have to think about what seasonings to add. Also, I would probably create a cranberry mayo instead of using cream cheese, as I prefer mayo in my Thanksgiving sandwiches. Served this with baked sweet potato fries which was INCREDIBLE.

WE LOVE THIS! I have made this twice and it's a keeper. I actually make it into a meatloaf instead of burgers and use 1.5 pounds of ground turkey and 1 box stuffing mix. It's quick and easy.

I've never had a turkey burger but had some ground turkey I had to use so thought I'd give this recipe a try. They were really good! A little dry but that was my fault, I kept them on the grill a tad longer to make sure they were cooked through. Next time, I think 5 minutes each side like the recipe says will be perfect. I didn't have any cream cheese so since I usually use mayo on turkey sandwiches, I used that and some chunky cranberry sauce. The cranberry sauce is a must! Hubby liked them: said this recipe is a "keeper"!

Update: made these again last night cutting the recipe down for 5 burgers - it made 4 really nice big burgers. This time I used just a little over the 5oz of stuffing mix that the recipe converted the measurement to and let it sit for a few minutes so the croutons in the mix could soften and soak up the moisture - I feel this is the key to keeping them moist. The first time I didn't do this and added more stuffing mix because I thought the mixture was too wet. It will still be wetter than a hamburger but once it's grilled,  the mixture stiffens up. Also I grilled it for the amount of time stated in the recipe - 5 minutes each side and they came out PERFECT. I mixed some leftover jellied cranberry sauce with  a few TBSP of mayo to make a spread (same thing I do for leftover Thanksgiving sandwiches). I also used a little mustard  on the bun - may sound weird but it really brought out all the flavors! I think I like these better than hamburgers!

I’ve made this a few times and will be making it tonight for our casual thanksgiving dinner.  I don’t add onions because someone doesn’t like them and I use goat cheese instead of cream cheese.  I bought  a goat cheese log covered in cranberries.I don’t have celery so I won’t add that either but it does taste good with it!  Great recipe!

We tried this tonight and I must say it is DELICIOUS!  My husband even enjoyed it and he is not a fan of ground turkey.

I used 1 lb of turkey and scaled the rest of the ingredients down accordingly.  I whipped them a few hours before hand, wrapped individually in plastic wrap, and refrigerated to ensure they would hold their shape.  This made 5 nice burgers.  Be careful, as the stuffing can cause these burgers to burn more easily than 100% meat burgers!  I topped with gouda, jelled cranberry sauce slices, & fat free cream cheese.  I also used pumpernickel hamburger buns, which gave for a nice presentation.  Next time I would add 1/4 cup or so of water to the stuffing, as they got a little dry without.  Would make again... thanks for sharing!

Yum!  *Might* prefer this as a meatloaf (yes, it's that good - though only some people liked the gravy & cranberry *on* the burger), but hubs said if we are cutting on the budget, and couldn't have a good slice of turkey meatloaf, that this is great as a burger (he prefers beef, don't get me wrong, but he really, really likes this!).

I'm a huge Thanksgiving fan, and these taste just like it.  Yum!   I went heavy on the stuffing mix, but it didn't matter.  The cranberry really adds to the flavor.  I skipped the cream cheese, no problem with the taste.  Everyone in my family loved them.

Thanksgiving on a bun any time of year! Great recipe! I added carrots & garlic to the sautéed veggies. Added poultry seasoning, sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, & pepper plus what I usually put in my stuffing: cubed bits of apple, craisins, chopped walnuts, cooked crumpled bacon or sautéed prosciutto, and 2 splashes of Balsamic vinegar. Sorry. When I was making your recipe, I just felt compelled to add more to the bread stuffing as the veggies were sautéing and with its wonderful aroma! I continued to follow your great recipe. I used whole cranberry sauce & topped it off with the cream cheese. Divine!
This recipe is great to use leftovers from Thanksgiving dinner as well.

I've made a similar recipe, but instead of cranberry sauce and stuffing mix, I use couscous & dried cranberries. Add a little basil and you have a delicious, healthy turkey burger. To top it I've mixed a bit of cranberry sauce and light mayo together as a dressing. Must be served on very good (or homemade) whole wheat buns. The one above I gave a try, but I prefer my original recipe.

So yummy on a cold evening or a night when comfort food in necessary. Dinner was done in less than 30 minutes, even my picky eaters liked it, and the left overs reheated great.  The only changes I made were halving the recipe, using a little milk instead of an egg (purely for allergy reasons) and adding a little sage to the turkey mixture. I will definitely make this again.

Different and tasty! We werent brave enough to put the sauce right on the burgers, but had it on the side instead. Without the sauce, would've liked the burgers to be more moist.

Me and my husband loved this recipe.  Instead of using cream cheese we used gravy!  I also added some extra spices to the burgers such as Thyme and Paprika as well as salt and pepper. Deffinitely a keeper!

My entire family loved these (I did add the turkey gravy and we ate ours w/ only 1 bun and a fork and knife).  In-laws and DH are requesting repeat already.  DH is picky but loves turkey and dressing.

Really, really good! I halved the recipe and didn't have any celery so when I sauteed the onions using cooking spray I added a bit of celery salt and poultry seasoning. Amazingly good! I could take or leave the cranberry sauce, but the whipped cream cheese is delish!
