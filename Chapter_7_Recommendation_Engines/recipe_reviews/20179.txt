My kids love this bread.  Here are some hints for Robert from Georgia and any new bread bakers.  First of all, use fresh, tasty ingredients.  Often, locally grown flours will taste best to you.  Filter your water before using it.  So, first put the salt, olive oil, and honey into a large mixing bowl.  Then put the water in a saucepan and add the cornmeal.  While stirring it constantly, bring the cornmeal to a low boil and boil it for 5 minutes.  If you aren't attentive enough, you will get lumps that will need to be picked out during the kneading process.  Add the cooked cornmeal to the mixing bowl and stir until thoroughly blended.  If you have a candy thermometer, stir the mixture until it cools to between 110 and 115 degrees.  If you don't have a thermometer, continue to stir just until there is no more steam coming from the mixture.  This is the time to add the yeast.  Stir in the yeast and let it rest for 10 minutes.  While you are waiting, prepare your flours by sticking a whisk into the flour bag and whisking the flour to fluff it up.  Now add a large cup of rye flour to the bubbly cornmeal yeast mixture and stir it in.  Then add a large cup of whole wheat flour and mix it in.  Next, add all-purpose flour 1 cup at a time until the dough isn't too sticky (probably 3 or 4 cups).  Then sprinkle lots of flour onto your kneading board and scrape all of the dough out of the bowl.  Set your timer for 10 minutes and start kneading the dough, continually sprinkling generous amo

Like the other reviewers (that coincidentally all reviewed in January as well), I found this recipe asking for too much white flour. I used approx. 6 1/2 cups (without changing anything else) and found that perfect. I just couldn't imagine kneading any more into it. Other reviewers mentioned multiple risings which I didn't find necessary. After mixing and kneading, I put them in the pans, let rise 40 minutes and then baked - how quick and easy! Very nice taste and texture.

Awesome!! A very tender bread with nice flavour.

Like other reviewers, I didn't use the full amount of flour. I subbed one cup of white flour with multigrain in addition to the rye and whole wheat and didn't keep track of the white flour used. I'd guess maybe 5 cups at the most but am not sure. I didn't like the look of the mixture just after adding the yeast so I threw it out and did it again, this time doing the yeast like all the other recipes I've used have called for - sprinkling the yeast in warm water and letting it sit for a few minutes. I reserved some of the water for the cornmeal before cooking it and used that for my yeast. Don't know if it makes any difference or not.

Someone commented that the crust was rather hard. After taking the bread out of the oven, I've always brushed the tops with melted butter. I find it makes the tops look golden and gives them a nice sheen as well as softens the crust.

I've just eaten my first slice and it is a nice tender bread. Not bland, with a very subtle taste of honey. I expect that the flavours will be more pronounced after the bread sits overnight, as most loaves taste even better the next day.

Five stars because the only issue seems to be the amount of flour if the recipe is followed as written.

I was a little concerned because so many people seemed to have difficulties with this bread, but I decided to try it anyways, since most of the problems seemed to be related to the amount of flour in it - an easy fix. I'm so glad I made it! It had a wonderful, smooth texture unlike any other multigrain bread I've made before - due, of course, to the fact that you cook the cornmeal first. 

The key, I think, is to add only a little white flour at first (2 cups, maybe, when the other flours are added), mixing in more as you knead the bread. This is certainly one of best bread recipes I've ever made!

I think that there is too much white flour in this recepie. I ended up using 4 cups and I think that that was too much. I'm going to try 3 and add more if it needs it.

I didn't get much rising either. I'm going to try three risings...see if that works.

The bread, even with it's faults, was awesome. Very tastey.

This recipeis great! I took it out of the oven 10 minutes ago, and first loaf is almost gone.  I didn't have rye flour, I used spelt and oat bran instead. I added two tablespoons of vital wheat gluten and a half cup of cooked quinoa. I used less flour than the recipe, but I didn't keep track... I just worked it until it was the right texture.

Delicious and moist. This has a great soft texture. For the flour, I don't add in the entire amount of white flour, I just knead in what it takes to make a smooth dough.

This was my first attempt at making home made bread! Made a couple mistakes but still love the bread and my picky 2 yar old even ate the crust!  May be a silly question but can anyone tell me how to store this bread? Can it stay out on the counter? IF so for how long?

DELICIOUS! We followed others' advice and reduced the amount of white flour. I ended up using 4 1/2 cups. Otherwise, followed published recipe and it was great! We ate sandwhiches for lunch and dinner, just so we could use the bread!

This bread turned out perfectly. It was my first time making bread and I was very nervous. I followed Miss Juliet's advice and my bread was perfect! I did sustitute a cup of whole wheat flour for the cup of rye as I didn't have any rye flour. Also, I used traditional yeast so I proofed it before adding it to the cornmeal mixture just to be on the safe side.

Hard dough to work with---I had to add more water to be able to knead. Didn't rise well during first or second risings, and I use a thermometer and high-quality flours. It tastes great though.

I'm new to bread baking so the family isn't accostomed to home made bread. My teenagers ate this up!! They loved it so much I didn't get to try a bite! I'm making more loaves tonight. I substituted rolled oats for the rye, because I don't have rye.

I wasn't pleased with this at all.Like others mentioned,I could only work in roughly 6 cups of white flour.I still had to add an extra cup of water to get the dough to a workable stage.There was just a bit too much dough for 2 loaves so I made it into 3.The finished bread had a hard crust,something I didn't like at all.The taste was a little bland for me also.If I make this again (which I doubt) I'd add an extra teaspoon of salt and cut back on the flour.

One of the best breads I've ever made!  (and I've been baking bread for about thirty years...).  I,too, was not ale to incorporate all of the white flour called for, but that didn't seem to be much of a problem; dough worked.  Other than that, I followed the recipe closely.  Made three nice-sized loaves.  Thanks, Jim ... I may have a new go-to bread recipe!

A very nice multigrain bread.  I let it rise twice before the final rising in the pans.  It has a very good flavor and nice texture.  I also used some King Arthur white whole wheat flour in place of about half the white flour. Next time, I will try it with all white whole wheat in addition to the regular whole wheat and rye flours.    Cooking the corn meal is definitely a plus.  It reduces the graininess of the corn meal.

Good bread!  I like this bread as sandwich bread.  I made the full recipe, and made one loaf plus four bread bowls to serve with my chili.  I think I just like it as sandwich bread--bf and I weren't keen on this bread as bread bowls.  Normally we both eat the entire bread bowl, but we left bread pieces on our plates tonight.  As bread, though, it's hearty and a little sweet but not too heavy.  I'll stick with loaves on this one.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is easy and delicious. Didn't have rye flour so used 2 cups whole wheat. Then added white flour as needed. Recipe calls for way too much flour.  Turns out beautiful and crust was soft without buttering. I will be making this again.

A soft, light textured bread with great flavor.  Not too sweet, just a full-flavored bread.

This makes a very yummy bread with a crusty crust and fluffy inside. I didn't really measure but upped the wholewheat to about equal parts with the white flour.  It takes a lot longer to bake than traditional bread recipe I think because of the cornmeal. Will defiantly make again!

I followed some of the other commenters for proofing the yeast and reducing the amount of unbleached flour. Also, I added an egg wash to the tops then sprinkled some slightly ground chia seeds for a little extra aesthetic and nutritional appeal! Altogether a delicious recipe.

We substituted spelt and quinoa flour, using only 1/4c whole wheat flour. Added about 2/3 C  mixed seeds (sunflower ...) next time we will try adding raisins or cranberries. Substantial bread!

I just finished mixing up this dough.  I took the suggestions of one of the reviews when she said to fluff your flour with a whisk before measuring.  In this way I was able to use 7.5 cups, but I didn't have rye flour so I added some cooked oatmeal.  It has worked up great and I'm letting it rise for the first time.

This bread turned out very heavy despite multiple risings. I wouldn't want to use it for sandwiches, but it's not bad sliced really thin and toasted very crisp. Dry, though. Needs jam or something.  I used half of the loaf to make bread pudding, which turned out very well.
