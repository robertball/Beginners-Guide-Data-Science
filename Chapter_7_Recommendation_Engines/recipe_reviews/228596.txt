This recipe is a keeper. I did not have the exact ingredients, so I used an Italian blend of cheese instead of swiss. I also seasoned it with what i had on hand. This was so good that my 3 and 5 year ate it. One thing I did notice is that with the size of my muffin cups this recipe made 12 and I only cooked it for 20 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were a hit!  They would be a great addition to a brunch table, and I would also send these in my child's lunchbox for a healthy and tasty lunch item.  I used what I had in my fridge, so instead of ham, bacon, added green onion, and used a tex mex cheese instead of swiss.  Yum!

I had never cooked with Quinoa before, as I am not uptight, but I was so surprised at the great nutritional values, and wonderful taste! This recipe is a winner! It was so easy to make! I didn't have the suggested ingredients so I used finely chopped bacon, and a blend of shredded cheeses. WOW. What a treat. I had a few guests over, and after a sizeable joint, we all thoroughly enjoyed these Quinoa Frittatas! I'd recommend it to anyone.

I've made these three times since the end of January (it's mid-February as I write). The first time, I made them exactly as written, the second time, I swapped spinach for the zucchini and the last time, I used smoked gouda instead of swiss and chives instead of parsley. It's a great base to experiment with but the original was great too. Next time, I think I might add chopped &sauteed onion, and possibly broccoli. I get 12 frittatas out of this recipe.

Love this recipe for breakfast! I made about 2 dozen and froze most except 5 for the work week.  At work , I would microwave for 1 minute and sometimes use 1 tsp of salsa if I wanted a little spice. I also used different cheeses and veggies for variety, ie, cheddar and chopped red and yellow peppers.

Delicious! Super easy and versatile! I used Gruyere and doubled the recipe. Used 6 eggs and 2 whites. This recipe is very forgiving and you can do a lot with it. I also added fresh herbs and pepper, next time will try feta,spinach and diced onions.Excellent as its written. Have it for dinner with a nice glass of sauvignon blanc.

Great recipe.  Only thing I changed was to use jack cheese instead of Swiss.  Interesting how the quinoa takes on the favors of the other ingredients.  Has a wheaty-vege taste more than ham and cheese taste.  Will definitely experiment with it.  Mine made 11 cupcakes and worked out to be only 3 Weight Watcher points each.

After I added some changes, the recipe was delicious!  I'm a vegetarian and deleted the ham. We experimented with different toppings because the frittatas needed more flavor.  After adding basil pesto to some and tomato basil pesto to others, they were a hit.  I  cooked the frittatas in regular muffin  tins and mini muffin tins and the minis were the best.

I make a similar recipe, first, use stock not water to cook quinoa, I add chopped broccoli fresh and fresh spinach, sauteed mushrooms and onion, garlic as well, I don;t use any meat, but I use a can of drained cannellini beans or black beans or both, I make a huge batch of these and they disappear quickly around here! Very good for you.

This recipe is great! Made this with a tiny substitution. I used some bacon and pepperoni instead of ham. Just didn't have ham on hand. This was awesome! Great taste. Easty to make, and I reheated the leftovers the next night, and they were great! Try them and don't be afraid of substituting different meats and veggies.

Great breakfast recipe. I adapted the recipe as I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I doubled it, used 6 whole eggs, 1 large grated carrot, and skipped the ham (we have vegetarians in the family). I used crumbled feta cheese and parmesan. Also added finely chopped chives. Next time, I will add finely diced onion as I think it will add more flavour. This recipe can be easily adapted to whatever you have in your fridge and pantry. The frittatas freeze very well and so make a great on-the-go breakfast for my teenagers who are always rushing in the morning and never make time to eat. Definitely a keeper!

I have made several egg muffin recipes and this one is the top one. I followed the recipe as stated and they came out amazing. The others I have tried tended to come up a bit bland and dry, these are moist and flavorful. I make these and freeze them to eat during the week as a quick breakfast.

These were great!  I used Red Quinoa, which may have made them nuttier tasting.  Need to spray muffin pan good.  I just sprayed bottom like for regular muffins and they stuck some.  Still awesome tasting!  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! I made them for the first time as written. So good! Can't wait to experiment with different meats, cheeses, and veggies. Will be making these often. I do like them fresh out of the oven better than reheated, but they are good and convenient reheated as well.
UPDATE.  Still love this recipe!! Our favorite way to make it is with sausage instead is ham and cheddar instead of Swiss.   Also I mix it up the night before, refrigerate over night and just bake it in the morning. Turns out great and very easy for busy mornings.

I beefed up my frittata with red capsicum(pepper)onion ( red, also spring)and another time used left over roasted sweet potato with corn, onion and chopped up celery..feta cheese is also great with spinach, onion, ham and capsicum combo ....throw in some basil leaves or chives to add a zing. I hardly ever use zucchini!The egg binds everything so most vegetables are perfect..I will use left over roast chicken (chopped finely) and whatever I have for my next batch, with dry herbs

So easy, delicious and nutritious too! I used rainbow quinoa (be sure to rinse well beforehand) cooked in chicken broth. I cleaned out the fridge with this recipe, bonus!  I used diced ham, real bacon bits, spinach, onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and a mix of cheddar, parmesan and swiss. I also used 5 whole eggs (didn't want to bother separating the whites) but next time I'll use 6 eggs. Added a bit of water to fluff up the mixture and seasoned with salt, black pepper, parsley, dill, and onion powder. Sprinkled a little extra cheddar on the tops before I put them in the oven. Baked 20 min at 350° as my oven runs hot, and they were perfect! You could use whatever veggies/meats/cheeses you want as this recipe holds up well to changes. This will make my grab-and-go breakfast routine super easy!

I used bacon bits and cheddar cheese because it's what I had on hand. Absolutely love these. I'll make a double batch and have breakfast for 2 weeks (freezing the extras). So filling, yummy and easy to make!

Love this recipe. It's great exactly as is but also had a lot of flexibility. We cook it in a pie dish and it comes out great. Also switch up veggie and cheese, all kinds of combos.

Absolutely wonderful! It's the perfect serving size for me to eat, since having gastric bypass surgery and a good amount of protein, which my life revolves around. Plus, my "meat-n-potatoes" husband can't get enough of these! Definitely making a couple times a week!

I really liked these and so did my hubby.  I followed the recipe except for I added some green onion, green peppers and some fresh spinach.  I love how you can add whatever veggies you like... next time I think I will add one more egg and maybe some shredded carrots and use cheddar or parmesan cheese. I have never cooked Quinoa before now but I have read that it's very healthy.  I will for sure make this again as you can really change this up to suit your taste.

This recipe is so flexible. I use 5 eggs (I can't be fussed separating the whites) and keep the quinoa and zucchini proportions the same. For the quinoa, it is very important to use chicken or vegetable stock instead of water. It adds a flavor punch that takes this dish to the next level.

this was really good.. i think the recipe as is would be on the bland side so i made a few modifications.. scaled this down to 3 servings (it's just me and bf).. used 1/2 cup cooked quinoa and 2 eggs.. subbed mozz for the swiss and halved the amount.. also subbed smoked sausage for the ham.. i used garlic seasoned parm instead of regular.. left out the parsley.. doubled the pepper (but i think it was a bit much.. bf said he liked it).. added 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and dried basil, a tiny tomato and some leftover canned mushrooms.. very tasty! ty for the recipe it was a good base

This is the 2nd time I made this recipe.  The 1st time, I added and subtracted ingredients - made 12 "muffins".  Today, I followed the recipe EXACTLY!  And again, I made 12 "muffins".  I'm not complaining, but the recipe says 6, so I wonder what size are the tins they're using?  Does this mean I can eat 2 for breakfast?  Seriously, 1 of these with 2 tbsp. of homemade salsa and a yogurt are a filling and tasty breakfast.  It's a keeper and has made it into my cookbook!

I liked these and so did my husband and son.  The recipe yielded 12 muffins. I may have cooked them a little too long because the quinoa on the bottom and sides were a bit crunchy.

Good, not great. I made the recipe as is, and they felt a little dry and none-to-special. Next time, a little less quinoa and a few tablespoons of cream cheese should do the trick. I like that the recipe lends itself to tweaks. I also think this would be amazing with a nice hollandaise sauce or a ber blanc of some sort.

My kids and I really enjoyed these.  Adapted recipe with what was on hand: shredded carrot and yellow pepper, shredded cheese blend instead of Swiss, dried basil.  No ham.  Turned out great.  12 muffins done in 25mins in a stone muffin cup thingy.

This was just okay. I made no changes to the recipe. No idea why it didn't turn out as well as other reviewers.

This recipe is so good, I was moved to sign up on recipe.com just so I could write this review. 

If you're thinking about it, stop thinking about it and just try it. It's amazing, and so good on variations. Just get the general proportions and you're golden. Made them twice now and can't wait to do it again. Just use whatever you have in the house or garden. It's a great harvest time recipe.

A couple of notes. If you use red quinoa (more dense than white), use about half as much. Also made a salsa with fresh tomatoes, onions, and sweet corn....amazing.

I did not have ham so the frittatas were a little bland. I added red and green bell peppers and a mixed blend of cheese.  Next time I would add ham & onions and would prepare less quinoa.  Would reduce baking time to 20 minutes.  It made 9 frittatas.

These are incredible!  Made two different batches in one night and used up leftover grilled veggies in one with some red pepper flakes and bacon.  The other I used spinach, zucchini , ham and no spice.  Family likes spicy better.  A definite keeper.

I'm so glad I tried this.  So easy and delish.  Great recipe for lots of variations.  I like 1/2 cup of onion or red bell pepper as a substitute for the zucchini.

These weren't very good.  They were pretty, but I didn't eat more than one.  My husband did but he covered them with leftover ham gravy because he didn't think they were great either.  He eats anything and even he said I shouldn't make them again.

This was very good, although it's a lot of quinoa.  I took out a half cup once I had it cooked.  Otherwise made as written and we enjoyed it!

I doubled the recipe and used cheddar instead of swiss and 6 whole eggs. My four year old, who almost literally eats nothing but egg whites, peanut butter, honey, and cheese, inhaled this. That is just amazing to me. Next time I plan to add shredded carrots as well.

In terms of nutritional content (especially for kids), this is just great!  I was so surprised that my normally picky son eat a whole piece, after saying he did not want to try any!! My husband raved about it.  Need I say more? Give it a try! This recipe is also very versatile, I didn't have zucchini so used broccoli and it worked very well.

I followed the recipe exactly and I cooked it for about 25 minutes and it made 11 muffins. I would make it again but when I do I am going to add another egg with the yolk because they didn't stick together well and I would also use less parsley and maybe add peppers for flavor.

I made a few changes, like using Bulgur in place of Quinoa, and flax eggs in place of real eggs. I'm also not a fan of Swiss cheese so used a combo of Mozzarella and Cheddar Jack. I didn't have a zucchini so grated a carrot and used it. No parsley on hand, and not a user of pepper(any kind!). I will say that I'm glad I doubled the amount of Bulgur I used, as I may not have had enough for 6 muffins otherwise. I baked for 30 minutes per directions. The 3 small frittatas came out perfectly. I went to take the larger muffins out, and discovered that they were not thoroughly baked! I have to put them back in the oven for an additional 15-20 minutes, and hope that they're done. (It was probably my fault- I put both muffin pans on the same shelf, and it might be the front 2 that weren't baked completely)

This is a great high protein breakfast. The zucchini made it a little soggy, so I used broccoli instead the second time I made this. I  also cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor.

Made it, loved it & I will definately make it again.
I swapped the Swiss & parmesan cheese & opted for Mainland aged cheddar tasty cheese. I left out the diced ham & I used free range eggs ( lovingly layed ) by my chickens. I especially liked that the recipe had quinoa!!

I also used chopped fresh spinach rather than zucchini (this is just what I had on hand). Also used bacon rather than ham (again, this is what I had on hand.)
One recipe really makes 8 regular muffin-size frittatas. Serve with fresh salsa (from a grocery deli aisle) for a bit of spice, as these are rather bland. Think next time I'll try breakfast OR italian sausage for the meat.

This was good but a bit bland; I'm giving it four stars for the general idea. I liked the quinoa but next time I'll probably decrease the amount significantly — it overwhelmed the frittata taste. I added green onion and a splash of milk and reduced the parsley. Next time I will use more vegetables, maybe some spinach and tomatoes instead of or in addition to the zucchini; as is I found the vegetable taste too subtle.  UPDATE:  5 star with less quinoa and a mixture of mushrooms, garlic, spinach and cherry tomatoes, and feta instead of Swiss (smaller amount of feta).

I added shredded carrots for some extra colour. I also substituted diced and sautéed portobello mushrooms for the ham. Delicious!!!
I also cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth not water.
My family and friends love these yummy treats cold or warm. They never last long at my house and are always requested when family visits.

These are a great quick way to start your morning. I made them exactly as the recipe said. I kept 1/2 in the refrigerator and froze the rest. They heat up very easily. Love the Swiss cheese, ads an extra zip to them. Great for gluten free eaters!

Breakfast on the go! I make these Sunday evening so I have something to grab for breakfast every morning as I'm running out the door to work. I love them because they're super easy to make and taste just as delicious on Friday as they did when I took them out of the oven. And the best part, they're good for you! Definitely a better alternative to coffee and a danish! Only thing I changed is I used turkey franks instead of ham....YUM. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this as per recipe except I used American instead is Swiss cheese.  They were a little bland to me, but I might try it again with sausage instead of ham. As it is written, they are very moist.

I'm a pretty good cook and I could tell when mixing that it was not going to work.  Like the recipe but I will definitely make adjustments.  Also, 6 muffin tins?  More like 12....  Or recipe should say 6 large.....obviously baking time will differ!

I made it basically as shown. I did add some eggs (6 total) because I added extra veggies and cheese, and did not separate the eggs for the egg whites.
This was tasty. I did add a touch of ground red pepper for our family taste buds, but otherwise, left it alone.
We froze the leftovers for a future breakfast or dinner. Looking forward to them.

Made as written and they were excellent. You can use this as a base and add any veggie, meat, cheese, seasonings you want. I personally did not like the addition of the parsley, was too grassy for me.

These are delicious and freeze well.  Pop them in the microwave later for a bit and you are good to go.  We don't eat pork, so we left out the ham.  It is also good with broccoli.

I loved the texture, flavor and consistency and will definitely make these again. I made a lot of changes due to what I had on hand. Turkey sausage instead of ham; Parmesan/Asiago cheese mix instead of Swiss.  I also had a frozen quinoa Mediterranean mix  (Simple Truth) instead of plain. Between the sausage the flavored Quinoa, I probably over-did the flavors, but it was delicious! I will try it again closer to the recipe.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I had no ham, so I substituted crumbled bacon. I made a double batch and ended up with 24 delicious mini frittatas. 
They went really fast! I am making another batch this morning using zucchini just picked from my garden.

Not bad - I am vegetarian, so I replaced the ham with bell pepper and onion.  I used fresh basil in lieu of parsley and sharp cheddar instead of swiss.  The texture of the quinoa was ... unexpected.  I was also surprised that these didn't have much flavor - a spoonful of salsa really helped ramp it up!

I loved the idea of these with quinoa and zucchini, but in the end was not a fan. They lacked flavor and I really don't know how I would make them better. I did not finish the batch I made so only give this one star.

Very easy to make and great way to pack a bunch of nutrients into a fun meal or snack. I sautéed some mushrooms and the shredded zucchini and added bacon bits instead of ham. I also only used cheddar as that's all I had in the fridge. This is a very flexible recipe and you can basically add any veg to it and it'll be delish. My 10 month old loves them and so does my husband so it's a winner!

These were delicious and there's so many different things you can add or change. I added finely chopped red and green bell peppers and used cheddar cheese. They turned out great!

I used green bell peppers, sweet onion, and cheddar jack cheese because that's what was available. I baked them for 15 to 17 minutes since I used smaller cups. They were a bit bland, my fault, but I think I might spice it up a bit with green chiles or hot sauce next time. Great use for quinoa.

Excellent and fun.  The entire family loved them.  I made some veggie and the rest with chicken.  We will try other suggestions such as spinich and asparagus in the future.
The only basic change I made was to increase the cook time to 40 minutes.  This made them firmer.
