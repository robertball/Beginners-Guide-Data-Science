TEN STARS!  I have used this with Eagle Brand, Nestle, Walmart brand, Meadowbrook, fat free, etc, etc.  It turns out EACH and every time.  I would point out that if you have ever made homemade candy of any type, this recipe will be super easy!  I can understand how everyone who rated this one low, did so.  It is really easy to scrape the sides of the pan---but DON'T....this is what causes all that sugar on the sides to turn the sauce gritty.  Also, don't let it turn too brown in color, this will make it taste burnt.  You should take it off the heat about a minute after you notice the color changing.  Be careful, once the color begins turning, it will go quickly!  You will notice an awkward smell, but don't worry, it is not burnt....yet.  The key is keeping your eye on it while it is cooking.  One other thing, when pouring the milk in, it is helpful for me to add about 3 Tbsp and stir that in (since it foams up so much) and then when that is stirred in add a little more and stir and then add the rest.  This recipe is the greatest!

This is very good, and the recipe is easy to follow.  I have passed this recipe up before because I was sure that the sugar mixture would burn during the long boiling time without stirring.  Don't be scared!  It doesn't burn- the sides of the pan get sticky and the mixture will stick (on the sides) when you pour in the milk- this is the reason you do not want to scrape the sides.  Make sure you do not scrape the sides as you pour it out of the pan either.  I found I had to boil for 12 minutes.  If you follow the directions you will have a beautiful caramel sauce.  I plan to use it for apple dipping tonight.

This sauce is very thin.  The flavor is okay, but I expected it to be thick.  It also separates when you refrigerate it, so it has to be heated and stirred back together.  I would not make this again.

Why does your test kitchen want to come up with something so complicated that I had to throw it away before even finishing the recipe??? This sucked to put it as nicely as I can. When this failed miserably, I pulled out my mother's very simple caramel sauce recipe - which actually involved CARNATION, thus my harsh tone with you - 1 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 stick of better and one cup of Carnation Evaporated Milk - stir well over heat until the sugar dissolved nicely.  Go back to what you have done best for many years - simple recipes that are timeless, foolproof and above all simple. I will avoid your recipes in the future.

Based on the review by Deneka (Dec 05), I tried making the sauce she described.  Well, that was not a success.  I just have sweet, buttery milk in a pan.  Can't find another recipe elsewhere with the ingredients she gives that may give more instuctions.

Yummy sauce, once I stopped burning batches. Took 3x to get it right. But if course you have to pay close attention to it. I'd make it again.

I really loved the recipe. Made it for several friends coming over and we dipped homemade pretzels into the sauce, also used to drizzle in coffee drinks. Very versatile. Everyone asked for the recipe, and I was thankful I could give it to them from memory. Before I melt sugar though, for flan or what have you, I always butter a ring around the top of your pan, it will keep the crystals from sticking. (and though I've never tried otherwise, making caramel in a pan other than non-stick is SUICIDE! don't try it.) I've not made any other caramel sauce, so four stars is all I can reasonably give.

Turned out great, really good with vanilla ice cream, bread pudding (what I originally made it for), and just about anything else.  Can vary flavors by using different extracts (I used rum flavoring for the sauce I put over bread pudding). -- 11/26/03 - Came back to edit because I've always made this recipe with Eagle brand; tried it today with Nestle and ended up with a slightly powdery texture that detracts from an otherwise tasty caramel sauce.

Wonderful, really rich, thick, smooth sauce - when I followed the directions exactly!

Then I tried to start fooling with the recipe - tips from my experiences:
Don't try to double or expand the recipe and. Don't use store brand sweetened condensed milk.  

Every time I have tried these things it has failed miserably (crystalized sugar mixture or gritty sauce that separates).

The taste is okay, very buttery and the vanilla is not very subtle.  But the most disappointing thing for me is that it turned out very gritty.  My daughter observed that it tastes like cookie dough!  And it does!  I'm not sure if it's the recipe, or my technique. I did follow the recipe exactly, maybe I did not let the water/sugar mixture get dark enough...it smelled like it was about to burn, so I pulled it off the heat. The store bought sauce would have been cheaper and much neater...not to mention convenient!  So off to the store I go, won't try this again!

I am so glad I tried this recipe again. I admit I didn't pay attention to the instructions to not stir once it began to boil! I followed the directions precisely and loved the results. A beautiful caramel sauce that taste excellent!!

This was the best caramel sauce ever. And SO easy. I drizzled it over the top of a homemade chocolate cake and sprinkled with chopped pecans. Very tastey!!!

This caramel is awesome!   The success of this recipe is all in the timing...you must watch it very carefully during the last four minutes of cooking.   The first batch I made burned...I think that the type of cookware and range has a definite effect on the outcome.   I cooked the second batch 11-1/2 minutes just until the sugar was an amber color and it turned out perfect!

This sauce is really yummy but I had some problems with clumping when I added the milk.  Also if you add a little bit of light corn syrup (about 1Tbs) to the sugar/water mixture it won't get gritty.

We followed the recipe exactly and got a runny mixture that looked like runny vanilla pudding.  Even with extra time on the stove to caramalize the sugar it didn't turn.

Not nearly easy and foolproof recipe it claimed to be.

Excelent recipe, but make sure you follow it exactly. If it's turning out gritty, it probably wasn't cooked long enough, the recipe does say a deep caramel color.

I made this recipe to layer over cheesecake. I took others' advice and made sure not to stir the sugar mixture while it was boiling. It took about 12-13 minutes to turn an amber color and was darkening quite quickly at the end, so make sure to really keep an eye on it. Also, stir the milk in slowly - it really foamed up! I only ended up adding 1/4 cup butter, but the end result was perfect! It smelled delicious and tasted even better.  This recipe is definitely staying in my recipe box!

I served over baked brie and with fresh apples slices. Tastes good but not like caramel. Only reason I gave it three stars is because my 9 yr. old son said it still tasted good. Otherwise it would have been two stars.

The recipe was thinner than I had hoped.  Even though I did not scrape the sides, I had bits crystalized sugar in my sauce. I had to use a strainer to remove them.

This is yummy.  It saves and reheats well, too.  Hardens as it cools and is perfect for caramel apples.  Not so "saucy," though...I had to make sure it was nice and hot before it would "drizzle."

Excellent sauce!  I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and it turned out great!  Sure it gets hard once it's refrigerated, but hello, it's CARAMEL!  It's sooooo delicious you will be eating it plain once it cools.  It's super easy to reheat, just scoop out a blob into a small bowl and pop in the microwave for 10-15 seconds and you're set!  I have to recommend trying this sauce over "Bread Pudding II" from a recipe on this site...it is too delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe produced a thick, rich caramel sauce, which we used on fresh-cut apples, ice cream, and apple pie.  It hardens as it cools, but we simply microwaved it for about 30 seconds - 1 minute to soften it, and it kept well in the fridge for several days.  I used real butter, real vanilla extract, and Carnation Condensed Milk.  I decided to try this new recipe at the last minute rather than buying ready-made caramel sauce for a get-together.  This was easy and superior to store-bought caramel sauce.

I gave Carnation 2 stars for at least pointing me in the right direction, I wonder if they even tried this recipe before posting it at All Recipes! It needed A LOT of help!! -including 20 min in the Microwave to turn the caramel "soup" into a half-way decent sauce!
