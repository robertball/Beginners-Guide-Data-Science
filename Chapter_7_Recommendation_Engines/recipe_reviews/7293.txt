Worked out why this icing turned out grainy for me. It's essential that all the sugar is dissolved BEFORE it comes to the boil, so keep on a low heat then when sugar's all gone increase heat to medium.
 Hope this helps.

This was fantastic!  You HAVE to cook the ingredients on low until the sugar is completely dissolved and the shortening is melted BEFORE you bring it to a boil.  I cooked it on low for about 10 minutes then boiled for 2 minutes.  Then take it off heat and keep beating it while it cools.  I beat it by hand for a minute then let it cool for a couple more then beat it again and so on until it was really thick and creamy.  It's best not to use it until it's nearly completely cooled.  My husband LOVED it.  He said it reminded him of the chocolate icing on bakery donuts.

DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE! IT IS HORRIBLE FOR LAYER CAKES AND REALLY BAD FOR SHEET CAKES! IT MIGHT WORK WELL FOR A GLAZE, BUT AS IT COOLS THE GRAINS OF SUGAR BEGIN TO SHAPE AGAIN, MAKING IT GRITTY AND UN-SMOOTH. I DO NOT RECOMEND MAKING THIS BECAUSE IT WAS EXTREMLY DIFFICULT TO SPREAD!

I made this for lack of confectioners' sugar. Why boil, oldschool? Throw all ingredients into a bowl, substitute margarine for shortneing, microwave for 1 minute on high, then whip boiling mixture. It is like a glaze; pour over any bland cake, and drink the rest! :)

The key is letting it completely cool. THEN it will be creamy. 

You can use it before as a drizzle. I used butter instead of shortening. Seemed healthier (if there could be such a thing as a 'healthy' frosting).

I really like this recipe as it tasty & requires no butter or margarine. It's definitely not a fluffy buttercream though, so don't expect that. I used this on brownies and it spread very well. I used rice dream in lieu of milk. Had all ingredients in pan on the stove, combined and melted until brownies were removed from oven. Brought to a full rolling boil and started the 2 minute count. Will use again and add a little more salt.

this icing tastes pretty good! It would make a good icing to drizzle over a bunt cake while still warm- maybe not a good frosting for a layer cake. Dries smooth and glossy

helping to troubleshoot the icing issues, make sure that when you mix ingredients before heating, sugar doesn't touch sides of pan, that's how you get those nasty crystals that make it grainy. also, two tablespoons of corn syrup helps keep it smooth as well

I'm going with 5 stars here. I read through the reviews before making it so I knew ahead of time it was going to be like the chocolate glaze on donuts. And to let it cool A LOT before frosting the cake. Those tips made this the best chocolate glaze I've ever been able to make! Thanks for the recipe and thanks for the tips!

I used rice milk because of an allergy to milk in my family and it turned out really well, but you do have to remember to cook it on really low heat to get the sugar dissolved THEN turn the heat up to boil. :)

All in all a good recipe. I made this for lack of confectioners sugar in the house, and was pleased with the simplicity. Texture came out good and was very manageable... I will, however, use less cocoa next time around - there is a bitter aftertaste I can taste the cocoa strongly. Thanks :)

This recipe requires patience. After first making it, I thought I had landed a raw egg-free way to make brownie batter (still delicious even if it wasn't frosting). But after letting it sit in tupperware in the fridge overnight, it had firmed-up just fine and worked as icing. I really like this recipe!

This icing turned out so yummy! I needed an icing without confectioner's sugar because I am out and I am so glad I came across this recipe. I followed it to a T except I added about a cup of blitzed raspberries with the vanilla. I wanted a chocolate raspberry icing to top fresh brownies and this is a keeper. It turned out sooo good and I had a hard time not licking the bowl. Great recipe, i will definitely use this again.

Oh my word! This fudge frosting was absolutely mouthwatering! It was perfect for what I was making (Chinese cookies) and it tasted delicious. Like other reviewers advised, I cooked the mixture on Low until all the sugar was dissolved. As for my own changes, I added 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup. I think this may have given the frosting a slightly creamier taste. After taking the saucepan off heat, I whisked the frosting until it was cooled and my frosting came out thick and creamy, just like I wanted. I can see that, if you did not whisk as long, this recipe would also be great for a glaze. Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

I'd never made fudge icing before but wanted a fudgy type topping for my homemade brownies. This was very good on brownies.
 I stirred till thickened like the directions said then pour immediately over my pan of 13x9 brownies. I also read other reviews that said to cook on low til the sugar is desolved, that solved any grainy-ness problems. (similiar to cooking flour off when making roux). I will def make this again!

This does taste great but it is a glaze not an Icing. Even after trying to thicken it with corn starch and powder sugar and then refrigerating it too, it was still to thin to pipe. Also the color turns into a "spotted" brown and not a solid color.

This is the best icing that I have ever made. Granted, I am only 16, so there's a lot of room for improvement. However, i did find that it was essential to make sure that all the sugar was dissolved before it was brought to the boil. I used butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any, and rum essence instead of vanilla. I also didn't have chocolate powder so i used 70g of chocolate chips. It was amazing. i had a whole lot left and my sisters ate it all.

If you follow the recipe and bring it to a rolling boil, then continue to cook for 2 more minutes, it comes out nice and fudgey. It was thick enough to spread on the sides of my german chocolate cake with the german chocolate icing filling the layers and on top. Turned out very pretty

I choose this recipe because I had no confectionary sugar on hand.  I followed Kate8's suggestion and put it in the microwave.  I just finished pouring it over my cake and it is certainly a very runny glaze, I wouldn't call it icing.  1/2 the recipe would have been sufficient for glazing.  I won't be using this one again.

I didn't have much confectioners sugar so I was looking for a recipe that used white sugar so I could make frosting for cupcakes. It came out soupy and would not thicken, even after boiling for two minutes and mixing for many minutes after removing from heat.

I poured this, while still hot, over "Peanut Butter Squares" by Marilyn Hanson.  YUMMMM YUM!

I substitued coconut oil in place of the shortening, but otherwise followed the directions.  Be sure to let the sugar dissolve over low heat BEFORE boiling.  Thanks to all of those who suggested this!

Not a nice fudgey icing for brownies.  Not smooth & creamy.  Don't make again.

In her description, Janice says "easy, quick, and good".  I would re-phrase that to "easy, takes some time, and BEST FUDGE ICING IN THE WORLD."  It IS easy, but as written in the negative reviews you can have a spectulactular failure with this type of sauce without some experience or better directions than are stated in the recipe.  As other reviewers have noted, you must cook it slow and low [and you don't need to stir it at all at this stage or you might get some sugar on the upper part of the pot or on your spoon that doesn't get melted] until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Other than not having enough instruction for beginners, the recipe is perfect as written.  I used about 1/4 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla--just my preference [and, admittedly, my compulsion to NEVER follow a recipe exactly].  If you get tired of beating--it works just as well to beat til starting to thicken, then let cool most of the way, then finish beating to spreading consistency.  Or if you want the ABSOLUTE BEST HOT FUDGE SAUCE YOU HAVE EVER HAD stop at the half way point and pore it over ice cream.  I had people swooning out of their chairs when I had a sundae party and used this.  This makes a glossy beautiful icing--very different from a buttercream frosting--but if you want a FUDGY icing you won't find a better one than this.

Tastes good.  I followed others instructions and made sure sugar was dissolved before boiling.  I also boiled it longer (5 minutes).  Used butter instead of shortening.

Like many others, I had run out of confectioners sugar.  For perfect results, follow Tracy's review(10-10-2008).  The result was smooth, creamy, and delicious!

Very easy... make sure your sugar is dissolved prior to boiling for one to two min. keep beating as it cools occasionally. I used a little extra vanilla and let it cool completely. Patience is key.

If you don't have confectioner's sugar on hand, this is a good icing.  Best of all, it is almost identical to my Grandmother's recipe.  
     Mix sugar & cocoa first.  Most important is to DISSOLVE sugar in mixture, before heating.  Cook slowly to a rolling boil.  This icing is ideal to pour on a hot cake in a casserole dish.

I made this recipe. It was delicious but was more like fudge candy.
I think the trick to it not crystalizing is DO NOY STIR after it starts boiling.
I'm now going to use this recipe to make fudge candy only I'm going to double it. Hope it works.

This was an excellent frosting for the chocolate zucchini cake I made, with some to spare so I dipped my strawberries in it - wow! It wasn't too sweet & was perfect accompaniment for strawberries.

It did not come out as cake icing at all. Very hard and crunchy. I made sure all sugar was dissolved so it was not gritty as others have said, just so hard that it chipped off the cake as I cut it. Luckily the cake wasn't important, just a last minute surprise for the kiddos.

Excellent, almost caramel-like chocolate icing. I used water instead of the milk and vegan margarine in place of the shortening, due to dietary issues. It turned out fantastic! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe turned out very smooth and fudgy but I would not call this icing.  More like hot fudge sauce for ice cream.  It was not at all appetizing as a topping for cake.

I felt that the sugar dissolved, melting the sugar completely, while hot it seemed very creamy, however once the sugar cooled, it assumed it's grainy texture.

I made this twice in one night because the first time I completely failed. The advice to cook on low until all the sugar dissolves before bringing to a boil is the secret to success. I also froze my cake before assembly which allowed it to keep its shape during the icing process. I covered an 8" round layer cake and used it as filling by doubling this recipe. Use the icing quickly because it starts to set as soon as you remove it from the heat. I poured it in the middle of my layer cake  and all over the top so that it covered the sides and it set beautifully into a thin, fudgey, delicious layer.  Don't bother with a crumb coat, it'll just melt and slide down. And note that you can't spread it, this is a pour-only icing. It will cling to the cake so be sure you like the shape and texture of your cake. It's ok to fill the crevice between the layers with buttercream (probably not a bad idea to pop it back into the freezer after that for good measure before pouring on the hot icing). Definitely place the cake on a wire rack before pouring on the icing, and then let it set for a couple of hours (or even overnight) before transferring the cake to a plate.  Huge hit with my family, I will use this again!

I absolutely love this frosting!!!!  On a white cake it is delicious.  I use butter instead of shortening and if you cook it a few minutes longer than the recipe calls for it makes wonderful fudge.  Used it during the holidays for neighbors baskets.  Added chopped walnuts and WOW!!  Neighbors called for the recipe.  And it's so easy to do.  Can't keep my hands off of it.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry!!!!!

It is grainy no matter how long you cook on low to dissolve sugar and it does not taste like fudge icing to me. Will not use again.

Ok this recipe went from BAD to GOOD. I picked this recipe bec I didnt have butter. I did dissolve the sugar on med low (like someone recommended)and it DID dissolve the sugar (meaning: no granules showing) BUT it set/dried so fast that I couldn't finish putting it on the cake before having to thin it with water. It also was NOT enough to cover a bundt whole cake. I ended up not serving it bec the icing tasted gritty and didn't have a very great flavor.***** OK THE GOOD PART: if you know anything about chocolate cake,you'll know that if you wait 1 or 2 days (or longer) all the flavors and texture of the cake are PERFECT. Choc cake never tastes quite as rich and flovorful the same day that it's baked. Well, this icing is the same way. A few days later (after letting it sit out, under a cake dome) OH MY WORD!!!!!!!!!! The icing was AWESOME, RICH AND WONDERFUL!!!  If you have a day or more to let it set up, this recipe is great or if you are just needing to "cover" a cake this is a good recipe.

This is a really good icing...if you are limited on ingredients.  It turned out a little grainy but tasted like chocolate fudge.  I used it on peanut butter brownies.  Turned out good.  I would recommend it if you dont have confectioner's sugar on hand!

it was really yummy I did let it cool completly but it was on the runny side. I am sure it wasnt the recipe I must have added too much liquid or somthing. it was very creamy. I used it on cupcakes and dipped the tops in so it worked great as a glaze. will try again my family loved it.

Great recipe! I agree with other reviewer, key is to disolve sugar on low then turn it to medium heat. I've made it twice this week with the Gob cake!

Easy to make,  Wonderful taste.  I doubled the recipe and it still came out perfect.  Of course, this gave me leftover icing to pour over ice cream later.  This is a thin icing.

Tasted fine, I am not sure what I did wrong but mine turned out runny.  Will try again I am sure with practice this could be a family favorite.
