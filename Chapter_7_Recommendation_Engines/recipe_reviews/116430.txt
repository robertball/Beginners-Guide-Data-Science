I'm so excited about this recipe.  I don't like salt at all, so I was a little nervous about using prepackaged stuffing.  So I used a cup of converted rice (2 cups cooked), 1lb sausage, and a bit more spinach.  It turned out great.  I love the flavors together.  I'm going to use this one over and over!  So easy to put together.

Wow! The sausage give spinach a much needed "giddy-up" flavor. I substituted vegetarian sausage crumbles for the pork and mushroom soup for the cream and eggs. I added 1/2 cup of milk to the soup to make it creamy. It was delicious for everyone in the family!

Our whole family really enjoyed this.  I used Stove Top sage which really added to the flavors.  I didn't have any jack cheese so I used sharp cheddar.  I also added 2T dried onion flake instead of the onion and 2t garlic powder instead of crushed garlic.  Oh and I used about 3# of sausage.  I don't think 1/2# would be nearly enough.  This is a great base recipe that we'll definitely make and play around with again!  Thank you!

This is super easy and soooo soooo yummy.  I got this recipe from the Taste of Home magazine about 2 years ago.  Don't change a thing.

Yum!! delish as a base recipe.  Next time I will sub in spiced sausage, add chopped bell pepper and perhaps try different cheeses.  Hubby loved it.

This was very tasty.  I made it for dinner - quick and easy but would make a wonderful breakfast or brunch meal.  Only change I made was to use non fat half-n-half.  Next time I think I might even use ground turkey or turkey sausage to make it a bit more healthy.  Mushrooms would probably be a good addition to this if you are into mushrooms :))  Thanks kathleen!

Very good. Would be especially good for brunch. I used fresh malabar spinach because I have a large plant(vine)and am looking for recipes to make use of it. I will make this again.

Wonderful flavor! I have never bought boxed stuffing mix in my life (I didn't know where to look for it at the grocery store!), and now that I know what it is I probably never will again. It came out pretty salty (which is ok with me), but it seemed like a lot of money for a little bag of bread cubes with seasoning. Next time I'm making my own. Anyway, the recipe is simple, easy to substitute fresh spinach. I didn't change anything else. Good the next day for a late breakfast!

Delicious meal! Omitted the garlic and made the rest as described. Husband doesn't usually like spinach but he loved this. It's got just the right blend of flavors so that one doesn't overpower the other. Will definitely make again for something other than the usual chicken, pork or beef.

I really liked this.  Hubby thought it was a little salty, not me.  My teen boys didn't care for it - I put in too much onion for their tastes. Great throw-together.  Would definitely work with whatever you happen to have in the fridge.

This recipe is so easy to put together the night before and what a huge hit it was!  I made it for Thanksgiving brunch and everyone wanted the recipe!  Light and not too filling!  Must try!

This was very tasty! Would be great for brunch. I thought it tasted better the next day so it would be great recipe to prepare ahead and just reheat. I used a pound of ground maple sausage and it was delicious! Everyone loved it.

I had high hopes for this, but I was disappointed.  It was just ok, but I will not make this again.

This was such a good recipe.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put 2T onion flakes and 2tsp garlic powder since these are ingredients I always have on hand.  Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe and everyone loved it.  This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely be making this again.

Made this for labor day brunch.  Everyone loved it.  I'm giving it 5 stars with the adjustments I made to the recipe.  I used more sausage and less spinach (half of a 16 oz bag of frozen spinach = 8 oz).  I used 5 eggs instead of 3.

This was very good. I used 1 lb of sausage and 1 lb of spinach, only 3/4 C half and half. Next time I would probably use 4 or 5 eggs.  Easy and tasty. Thanks.

Exceptionally good. My only complaint is that it was a bit salty, since I used stuffing from a box, but the idea and flavor was there! I substituted spinach for olives because I didn't have spinach on hand. It worked well and I'll be sure to make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Worth it and a family pleaser!  I used twice as much sausage than the recipe calls for and it wasn't dry at all.
