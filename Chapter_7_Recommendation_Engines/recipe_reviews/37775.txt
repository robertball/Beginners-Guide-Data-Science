I've been making this recipe for many years, and just came across it on this site.  My whole family loves it--I don't change a thing, except one time I didn't have any apricot preserves for the sauce, and used strawberry jam with the dijon mustard; everyone liked this sauce better, so now that's all I use.  Seedless raspberry jam also works well.  A time saver to consider: instead of dipping and dredging each individual piece of chicken, I use two ziplock bags--one for the egg and the other for the coconut mixture.  Put the chicken in the egg bag and squish it around until all pieces are coated; then drop them into the coconut bag, seal it, and shake away.  You can sprinkle any leftover coating on top of the chicken in the pan before pouring on the butter. This recipe also travels well if you have to bring an appetizer somewhere; just cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before coating and baking.

Great! moist, coconut flavor.. the butter will make them brown.. so on second batch, I used more butter.. two other changes I made: a little more garlic, and did use the pineapple-apricot preserves.. but the apricot preserves are good too.. pople love the dip... thanks for the recipe Kraft! oh yes... I also let the chicken set in "cream of coconut" a few hours before preparation.. adds to flavor, tenderness and moistness.. Great recipe!

These were great! But I do have a suggestion.  Make sure that the chicken is completely covered with the melted butter before baking or they will have uncooked flour still on them.

I ended up marinading the chicken in one can light coconut milk and a tablespoon of key lime juice.  I also added a cap full of coconut rum to the egg mixture for a subtle hint of extra flavor and made the breading mixture a combination of 3/4 cup panko (Japanese) breadcrumbs since they add more crunch and texture than flour and 1/2 cup coconut.  Served with the sauce mentioned here as well as a pina colada sauce.  The result was flavorful, moist chicken that was neither too coconutty or too bland.  The Panko also helped give it a nice crunchy texture on the outside.  Loved this and would give it a 5 with my updates, but not sure I would have enjoyed it as the recipe here states.

SUPER EASY!!  My husband said these were the BEST chicken strips he's ever had.  I don't eat starch so I used almond flour instead of regular.  I ground the coconut bc I have young children and didn't want to get the dreaded "no way" response!!  I also added extra garlic powder as others suggested and used 2 ziploc bags to coat (1 w egg and 1 w the coating).  I sprayed the chicken w olive oil rather than butter and had them all on foil sprayed w non stick spray.  Next time I'd add a little more salt.  Oh and I used homemade raspberry jam w the dijon for the sauce.

These were pretty good. I followed the receipe exactly and mine never got golden brown like the photo. The taste was good but the texture was soft - not crispy like I would have preferred.

Delicious!  Based on other reviews I doubled the salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also added 1/8 teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. I used 1.5 cups of coconut and unseasoned bread crumbs instead of flour.  Also used 2 eggs.  Even with the additional wet and dry mixtures, I ran out with about 5 fingers to go.  I didn't flip them and although they were only a very light golden brown I thought they were beautiful.  I'm proud to say every last one was eaten at the party I took them to.  Yum!  If you really want a strong coconut flavor, I've seen dipping sauce recipes made from crushed pineapple, sour cream, and pina colada mix.

I enjoyed this very much. So did my 3 yr. old.  The dipping sause was great with this.  The only thing I did different is after it was done baking, I put it under the broiler for 2-3 mins to crisp it up.  It was great.

These were so easy and delicious! The coconut added a nice flavor without too much sweetness. I used a little more garlic powder than called for. I baked them a little longer (could be my oven) and they turned out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.We really enjoyed the sweet/tangy dip, too. Thanks to the folks at Kraft!

I'm known for not being able to cook well, and my husband's first words after taking a bite of this was "Wow". I doubled the batch so I could experiment with it. Both batches were marinaded in coconut milk over night. I was skeptical to do that at first, but I really think it made a huge difference. One batch I left the coconut milk on, then dipped in the egg, then the dry mix. The other batch I also left the coconut milk on, but dipped in the dry mix, dipped in the egg, and then dipped in the dry mix again. When I asked my guinea pig (my husband :) ) which one he liked better he said hands down the double dipped ones. Doing the double dip did get very messy, but it was worth it. The normal ones were good too, but I think double dipping it really added alot of extra coconut flavor, which the normal batch lacked a little. The sauce was good as well. I'm not a huge mustard fan, so I think next time I'll try the pina colada dip. Overall, this is a keeper.

I keep going back in forth whether this is a 3 or 4 star recipe.  I will definantly agree that visually, it is lacking a bit.  I think the picture must have been deep fried and that is fine but I think a lot of people were just expecting that outcome.  I used panko instead of the flour and I think that definantly made quite a bit of difference.  After they were done, I but them under the broiler on low and it cruched them right up!  I was really skeptical about the sauce.....boy was I wrong!  I did run it through the blender to get a smoother texture and added a bit more apricot vs mustard just to my taste.    The whole package tastes fantastic though so I guess it has earned its 4 stars!

I loved this recipe! Just made it for a baby shower on Sunday and they were gone in 10 minutes! I did follow the suggestions of using the Panko Japanese bread crumbs instead of flour and I used a butter spray instead of melted butter. I coated the bottom of my baking pan with melter butter and then sprayed the chicken as well. I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for, but mine came out crispy. I really liked this recipe a lot! I served it with the Dijon/apricot dip as well as spicy spring roll dipping sauce. Thanks a ton!

Ok, I am adding to my review. I have made this recipe now 7 times. Besides the first, all by request. This is an awesome recipe. Use Crisco Olive Oil spray instead of butter to make it more healthy and more crispy. This is a 5 star recipe, don't let others fool you. I am catering for a small wedding today and through word of mouth from this recipe, they requested that I cook for them. Awesome!

Wonderful recipe for appetizers or main dish.  I added curry powder per LIANNENC's suggestion and it made it!  I also used a couple of garlic cloves and a chopped onion slice (instead of powders in the flour mixture) on the bottom of the pan --the flavors came through and they protected the coconut from the direct heat.  Make sure the pan is not too hot so the coconut doesn't burn.

It was good, yet lacked the "blow me away" flavor that I reserve for five stars.  Other than lacking a lot of flavor, I would do it again.

This dish was moist and delicious, but I made a few changes.  I added several dashes of curry powder, which was really wonderful.   Also, I never turned it so that it would be crispy on the top (it worked!).  I also needed another egg and more coconut/flour mixture than it called for.  It was also labor intensive but really yummy!

We love these! They added a wonderful tropical flair to my luau! Everyone adored the dipping sauce- i did it with apricot-pineapple preserves, it's even better than just plain apricot! I grilled them this time,  but the coconut burnt on some! They were still very yummy though! ANd instead of drizzling the melted butter, i just hit each one with a few squirts of spray butter- very easy and less messy than melting butter!

We absolutely love this recipe. Both the chicken and the dipping sauce are terrific & tasty.  The only change I've made is to spray the chicken with butter flavored cooking spray this saves a bit on calories and fat.

With a few adjustments this is amazing! Upon reading other's suggestions, we added a cup and half of coconut flakes, about 1/4 cup of Splenda, extra pepper, garlic powder & onion powder, and we thoroughly covered the chicken with margarine. It was so tasty! It was gone 10 minutes after we made it.

I thought these were very tasty, but not as crispy as I would have liked. The recipe is a keeper, however, next time I'll put them under the broiler for the final couple of minutes.

This was really great!  I read the notes before I made it for dinner last night, and I added extra black pepper and garlic powder plus cayenne pepper and onion powder.  I also added some panko bread crumbs to the coating.  I stuck them under the low broiler for the last 2 minutes of cooking plus for about an additional 2 minutes.  My husband and I loved these and plan on making them quite often.

This was good.  We enjoyed both the chicken and the sauce.  The only reason why Im not giving it 5 starts is because the picture is not realistic, those sticks must have been fried.  I tried to spray them lightly with oil and I broiled them for a moment in the end, but they still weren't so attractive.  Otherwise, they were really good and I'm sure we will eat them again sometime.  Thanks!

This was very good, I used Panko Japanese bread crumbs instead of flour and for the sauce I used black raspberry instead of Apricot with the Dijon and it was excellent. I also baked it in the oven after covering the cookie sheet with foil and adding oil for about 35-45 min, turned out crispy. So good it was asked for again the next day.

Loved this!  I used jalapeno jelly and dijon mustard because that's what I had in the fridge and it was a terrific combination.  I also broiled them for a few minutes, and that gave them a nice colour and a nice crunch.  We just finished eating, and I'm wanting to do this again tomorrow..heh heh...

This recipe sounded wonderful, but I was a bit disappointed (maybe because we were thinking it was going to taste like coconut shrimp).  Next time I'm going to add more coconut because my husbands complaint was that he couldn't taste coconut at all times.  Also next time, I will use spray butter for convience & calories, like others recommended.

This tasted good, but not amazing.  I found it pretty messy to make, and the coconut is quick to burn.  I found that some of the chicken fingers had coconut that was burnt while others weren't fully cooked yet! The dip was very good and really helped for the burnt ones!  I'm not sure I'll make this again.

This is soooo good!!! I was a little apprehensive about making these on my own but they were very easy to make. My daughter was unsure about trying them but loved them instantly. I love coconut shrimp and this is the same idea. The dipping sauce was delish too. This will become a staple in my recipe box now!

Awesome!  I have made this twice and my husband asks for it almost every other day.  My first batch did not get as brown as the picture, but I found that to be ok.  My second batch I added more butter and got them real golden, but they were overcooked.  So the called for amount of butter was better even though there wasnt thorough browning on both sides.  That allowed the coconut to stay moist and yummy.  I also didn't cut the pieces as small as the recipe called for since I served this dish as an entree.  I served the fingers with honey mustard dipping sauce.  This is a keeper and oh so simple it is ready in a flash with items kept in my pantry at all times.

Pretty good, but get tired of the coconut quick. I think the baking made the coconut too chewy. I seasoned the egg mixture with salt & pepper, to ensure flavor on the chicken. As people commented on this being bland.
I will try this deep fried next time to crisp up the coconut.  It's a keeper!!  Just needs some tweeking.

This was the perfect pick-me-up for a rainy day. It made me feel like I was somewhere tropical. If was very easy to do and tasted delicious.  I especially liked that it did not need to be fried.  I took the leftovers for lunch the next day and my co-workers each wanted a bite!
They all want the recipe.

because of some of the earlier reviewers complained that it wasn't "Coconutty" I kicked it up by adding some Malibu Coconut Rum to the beaten egg mixture.  That helped a lot.  I also added a bit of cayanne pepper to the dry mixture.

I've made three times now and have come back to add comments to my review.  The first time, I followed the recipe including the apricot dipping sauce (which was better than I expected).  The meal was good, but not great.  I did have a problem with the chicken not browning evenly in the oven even though I had coated them with spray butter.  The second time, I used 1/2 cup of crushed saltines and a couple tablespoons of flour, added a cap full of coconut rum to the egg mixture, and doubled the seasonings - they turned out better.  I made a few more adjustments the third time.  I ground up the coconut a bit more because I found it to be a bit chewy previous times, I think in part due to the size of the flakes.  Still added 1 cap full of coconut rum to the egg.  I used panko bread crumbs this time with a heaping table spoon of flour, added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, and then pan fried them.  They cooked much more evenly this way, the breading came out much lighter and crispier... and they tasted FABULOUS!  I also tried a honey mustard dipping sauce recipe that I found here, which I don't typically like, but found that it went really well with these.  With my final adjustments, I would rate this 5 stars.  Thanks for the original recipe, I love these!

The taste was good, but mine didn't brown as much as I had expected them too.  We really liked the sauce, though.  I like this recipe, I think I will play with it a little to see if I can get more of what I was imagining.

This has become a staple in my house. I often make it for dinner because my 2 daughters love it.

Over time, I have found the following things improve the recipe:
* Use double the garlic powder
* Mix the dry ingredients (except the coconut) and place into a zip lock bag.
* Use two eggs, dip the chicken in the egg, throw in the zip lock bag and shake to coat with dry ingredients.
* Use 2 cups of coconut and place in a large bowl.
* Remove the chicken pieces from zip lock bag one by one and press on coconut to each piece by hand so you can get them nice and covered.
* Use 1/2 cup of butter to drizzle on chicken.

With these changes, the results are even better!

I modified this somewhat and it was absolutely yummy!  My husband loved it, though 
I couldn't get my 7 year old to try it.  I added a bit more garlic powder to the coating 
mix, as well as a couple of dashes each of onion powder, paprika and curry powder.  
The curry and coconut were wonderful together!  I also did not turn the nuggets over 
midway through cooking and they were somewhat crispy & nice and toasty on top.  
I didn't have the ingredients to make the dipping sauce but I will the next time I make 
this recipe, and I'm DEFINITELY making it again!

I have made these before seeing this recipe. Try deep frying them then finishing them off in the oven. I also serve them with a raspberry sauce made by reducing a bag of frozen berries with some triple-sec and corn starch. Save some time by using chicken tenderloins.

We loved these! Thanks to those nifty butter spray bottles, I lightly sprayed the butter overall and took reviewer "nicoleshira's" advice and once they were done, put them under the broiler for 2-3min. Wonderful! The dipping sauce is a highlight but they were wonderful without too. These disappeared pretty fast and next time, I'll have to double the batch. Thanks again Kraft!!

Although my children did not LOVE this recipe, I tink they will once I fine tune it a bit.  For my children, I think the coconut was a bit overwhelming.  I may try to blend it better next time.  My husband and I loved this recipe and look forward to serving it again.  Next time, maybe my kids will love it as much as we did!

these coconut chicken fingers rocked!! it was pretty easy to make, and didn't take that much time to prepare. my whole family liked them! i also added some cajun spice to jazz it up, and also sprinkled some extra coconut on top. someone had mentioned that they would make a whole chicken breast prepared this way, and i agree! they were a perfect balance of salty & savory & sweet! i didn't make the dipping sauce. my guys used ranch, and they loved it. i liked it plain. all hail coconut!!

Ok, these turned out pretty good.  I added curry (bout 1/2 tsp) and doubled all other ingredients.  I used panko bread crumbs and just a handful of flour.  Marinated the breasts for a couple of hours in Pina colada drink mix. Melted butter in the sheet pan, and sprayed the tops with spray butter.   Of course they didn't crisp up like I wanted, but the taste was really good.   I made the pina colada dipping sauce (1/2c pina colada mix, 1/2c sour cream, and 1/2c crushed pineapple), THIS was the best part!!!  Kids both ate it (2 picky boys) and hubby LOVED it!  Thanks!!

Wow!  I made this last night.  It was soooo easy and really tasted great.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Even the teenagers raved about it, as did my husband who is really a steak-kind-of-guy.  :)
I made the sauce but halved the ingredients and used orange marmalade because I didn't have the apricot preserves on hand, and it was a perfect addition.  I will definetly be making these again. I'd also think they'd be a real crowd pleaser for company.  Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe!!

I thought these were pretty good.  I really wish they were a bit crispier though.  I made this with the pina colada sauce that Red Lobster makes and it wasn't too bad.  My husband , on the other hand, wasn't too fond of them.  He knew they were made with coconut and doesn't really like coconut.  I would probably make this again but not too often.

These were great!  This recipe delivered exactly what I was looking for.  Next time I make these I'm going to try it without drizzling the melted butter on them.  That will cut the fat calories in half and I don't think I'll miss the butter as I'm used to eating "lighter" foods with low fat content.

My chicken turned out very dry.  I would use breadcrumbs in place of flour.  Instead of using strips you should try using whole chicken breast.  Slice chicken into strips after the chicken is cooked. The sauce is wonderful.  Make sure you refridgerate it for 30 minutes.  This will allow the ingredients to incorporate, for a better tasting sauce.

This dish is better than words can describe!!! **Though I will admit that I read the recipe wrong and I thought it was for a main dish, after seeing that it wasn't I then just tripled the recipe because we have a large family! It was great and it was a great change from the regular chicken strips. We ate them without the sauce, they were good just plain to us.Thank you for sharing this recipe. :)

Not at all what we expected. The coconut flavor was barely noticeable even though the spices came through just fine. I actually had a difficult time with the batter not sticking to the chicken (much of it fell off when I turned the pieces) and I'm not sure why that is. The coating really didn't get crispy or brown at all. Well, some of the breading actually ended up burned but most was very light brown or even gooey in spots. I tried baking an extra 10 minutes or so with no particular success. The chicken did end up nice and moist though. I might try this again using a broiler and some of the other suggested modifications.

This recipe was pretty easy to make and was good, but not what I was looking for.  I was trying to find a recipe similar to TGIFriday's, and this was not it, but close.  The batter for the coconut to stick to the chicken was just not right.  The chicken came out very tender though, and overall our family did enjoy it, and we have some picky eaters.

This recipe was easy and delicious. Most of my kids do not like coconut so if they didn't ask what was on it i didn't tell them and 6 of the 8 loved it!  I too was a little disappointed that they didn't brown, but they were tender and moist

It was ok. I didn't use Baker's coconut since I live in Sweden and they don't sell it here.  Overall, I felt like it was missing something. Probably more spices.  I liked the dipping sauce a lot though, it was interesting and sweet.

The kids really liked this chicken. I served it with heated apricot jam (added a little bit of water to thin jam). It disappeared quickly. I will make it again.

This is a delicious recipe!  I have had several friends ask me how to make this after trying it.  I you love coconut like I do, then you will love this treat!  Make sure you use the dipping sauce too!

I absolutely love this recipe! It's easy and foolproof. The ingredients are readily available and it's just impossible for this not to turn out great every time.

My family loves it, I always get requests to "make it again".

These were really pretty good ... I'm not sure I'll go to the trouble of making them again, though.  The flavor without the dipping sauce (I used strawberry jam and mustard as another reviewer suggested - yum, btw) was very bland - though they were crunchy.

My husband and I thought this was great!  The kids didn't like it as much, but that's not unusual, as they like only a certain menu of food at their age.  We are thinking of trying it out on shrimp and fish (maybe add a bit of cornmeal to the fish).  Thanks for the recipe--it's a definite keeper!!

I made this for supper with a side of fresh green beans, and it was very good.  Not so good leftover, though, so next time I will only make enough for one meal, or a party appetizer.  I used KELOUA's suggestion to marinate in coconut milk and a Tbsp of lime juice, and I definitely recommend that.  Also used bread crumbs instead of flour - I forgot to top with butter or olive oil spray, but since I used bread crumbs they were crispy and had no raw flour taste, and that saved me a few calories.  Used mango preserves instead of apricot, and loved it - even though I normally don't like sweet food (except for dessert).

I love coconut shrimp, but shrimp is expensive.  So I thought I'd try this chicken recipe.  It was fantastic!  I did use others' suggestions and used bread crumbs.  I think it added extra flavor and crispyness.  It needs to cook a bit longer, though, to get that real crispy texture.  The sauce with the chicken is such a great complement.  This is definitely a keeper.

These are yummy.  Nice to find a healthier alternative to deep frying.  I was afraid they wouldn't crisp up, but they did so beautifully even after cutting down on the butter!

These were a hit when I made them for a luau. I did cook them longer to get the coconut coating to crisp up more (about 10 minutes more on each side). Otherwise an easy, yummy recipe that I will make again for sure!

Very good but you can not get them brown in the oven just like everyone says.. But I had to try it that way first then I decided to fry them. Much better to do that first instead of wasting energy heating the oven up.

My father is an accomplished italian cook and I brought this for his birthday feast as an 'extra'.  My brother in law scarfed it down as did all the kids!!  I did have a little scare though, forgot to drizzle the butter on top before cooking, but not to worry!  I just put it on when it was done and used the broiler just long enough to hear a little sizzle.  Otherwise it would have been too dry.  It came out perfect.  I also decided to follow advice of other posters and decided not to turn it, it was perfect!!  Thank you so much!!

I thought these were good and the dipping sauce was wonderful.  I use a pound of chicken breasts and two drumsticks.  I increased the salt and garlic powder and used two eggs instead of one.  (I think one egg probably would have been enough.)

It was actually 3 years ago that I made this recipe (and still remember it well!!) so was looking for it again and am SO glad to find it!!  The dipping sauce is EXCELLENT and so unique.  I just had a bit of a problem with the coconut burning but wanted them to get crispy.  However, these are YUMMY!

This came out very yummy.  I greased the bottom of the pan with butter.  And I didn't have enough apricot preserves, so I used some honey.  I also only had regular yellow mustard, so I just used a few squeezes in the apricot preserve/honey mixture.  It was still very good. A new idea to boring chicken and easy too.

Absolutely delicious. The apricot dipping sauce is so good too - the sauce it what makes this recipe light and refreshing. Perfect for when you have friends or family over during the summer. I served this with fresh veggies (cucumbers and grape tomatoes) and hummus. An extremely refreshing and satisfying summer recipe. Also, it's a little gourmet too, but SO easy to make...so it's easy to impress people with this, with not much trouble to yourself!

My teenage daughters & I really enjoyed this recipe. I will definitely added to my collection.  Instead of drizzling with melted butter I sprayed both sides of chicken strips with fat free butter flavored cooking spray Pam.  You might need to re-spray during baking time and turn chicken a couple of times for a more golden look.  I also used ranch dressing for a dipping sauce.  See Ranch Dressing II by Dawnia.  Very delicious.

The taste was good, but they had a bit of a floury aftertaste and they never got brown except some of the coconut looked a little burnt on the edges. Presentation, 1 star.  I don't know how they got them to look ever so brown in the picture, but by cooking in the method in the recipe, these come out fairly white (and pasty). Again, I followed to the T except I had to cook them longer and flip them to get them to brown in any way.  I'm thinking frying these in oil would be the way to go.  Dipping sauce was great.

I was surprised with this recipe. I thought it would be better. It was okay and easy, but not great and slightly messy. I would make it again as something unusual to  bring to a party, but I would spice it up a little. Just a little too bland for my palate!
