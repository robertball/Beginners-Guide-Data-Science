This is absolutely the best...crispy, crunchy, mild sweet flavor...not like the tooth-breaking commercial biscotti. I baked this for the first time last week exactly as printed with exception of using almond flavoring instead of anise. Like some others I found the baking time needed was less than the recipe stated, so watch it closely. Here are few tips that I'd suggest to those with less than satisfactory results. Do NOT add more flour. Stir it up as the recipe states and then divide the dough directly onto your well greased baking sheets. Use your hands to form it into a long roll that goes the length of the sheets and then use your fingers or a rolling pin (I used my Pampered Chef little roller) to flatten it out to a rectangle about 4" wide and about 1/2" thick. Bake. Remove from oven and while still hot use a pizza cutter to cut into strips. Flip strips on their sides and return to oven, continuing as the recipe directs. This worked absolutely perfectly for me and was so much easier than transferring a pre-formed roll of sticky dough to the baking pan and then contending with trying to slice a cool (and very crumbly) finished product. Hope this will help some of you and encourage you to try again. It's soooo easy and so tasty with ingredients just as they are! Wish I could give it more stars! I can't keep my hands out of the cookie jar!

Delicious!  Great with coffee or as a snack.  I did not have anise so used 1/2 Tbsp. almond and 1/2 Tbsp. vanilla intstead.  Great flavor!  TIP:  Once dough is made; get a couple of long sheets of wax paper and split dough into 2 equal parts; place dough half on wax sheet and fold excess wax over dough allowing room for expanision; apply pressure/shape dough without having it stick to your hands or your kitchen counter.  Do same with second half. Good luck!

I am a seasoned baker, and have tried many "biscotti" & "mandelbread" recipes over the years.  This is the BEST recipe by far.  It is simple, does not require the use of a mixer, and is just delicious.  Every time I make it and serve it with coffee to guests, the raves are unbelievable, and I always send my company home with some.  Thank you Jandee.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I have personalized it for my family and have made it many times now. Instead of 1 cup sugar, we add half cup each of white and brown. Throw in 1 cup chopped almonds, (some finely chopped and others coarse)-  mix in with flour,add 1 tbsp. almond extract and 1/2 tbsp vanilla to the wet ingredients. This time I am also adding some chopped dry cherries, then you can drizzle with melted chocolate or almond bark for a special flair. Sad thing is, now my husband doesn't want to go to the coffee shop anymore - he insists these biscotti are so great - why buy them! (I do agree, so now does anyone have a good cappuccino recipe they'll share? :) THank you Jandee! PS - these make incredibly elegant (not to mention EASY) gifts for anyone you care about!

I am a pastry chef and make this recipe to go with the espresso that is served at my restaurant.  I omit the anise oil and add 1/4 teaspoon EACH cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and coriander.  Yum!

I loved this recipe. Of course, I did my own flavor invention. I omitted the anise, and added orange extract instead, and added 1T orange peel and 1/2 T cinnamon. Then spread white chocolate over top. They are a hit. As far as the stick dough goes, a trick I learned working with meatloaf... keep your hands ever so slightly moist at all times (NOT wet), and any sticky mixture ends up shaped perfectly. Add no flour at all whatsoever, no matter what the temptation. Managing with wax paper and moist hands is the key.

I've tried 3 biscotti recipes in this site and this is the one I like the best. I used crushed fennel seeds and a tsp lemon extract and it turned out great. I like softer biscottis, so I baked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, then cut and rebake them for 4 minutes on each side. I found that oil is better than butter or margarine. The biscottis are not as crumbly. Thanks Jandee. This is a great find for me. MistIver

Even though I almost always bake with ONLY real butter, I followed the recipie and used vegetable oil. I did not find it necessary to add any extra flour as did many others who reviewed this recipie. I used  brown sugar rather than white, and 1/2 tbsp. vanilla and 1/2 tbsp. almond extract b/c I did not have anise.  Rather than mixing chopped nuts into the batter itself.  I pressed finely chopped walnuts into the top of the logs once shaped and on the cookie sheet. The recipie is excellent and the final product has a WONDERFUL texture and flavor.  This recipie is truly representative of fine biscottis you find at the coffee shop.

This is a great recipe!  I substituted 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp almond extract for the anise extract, with wonderful results. I turned the dough out onto floured waxed paper and it handled very well.  The recipe is easy to make and could successfully be varied by adding nuts, dried cranberries, etc and changing the flavorings.  This will be a nice addition to your holiday cookie trays. Whether you are a seasoned baker or not, give this recipe a try.  You will be glad you did.

This recipe is wonderful! So easy! Before I baked them, I sprinkled them with some crystal sprinkles. The next batch I made, I used vanilla instead of anise and threw in some chocolate chips and some almond slices. I also melted some chocolate chips in a shallow pan and dipped the bottoms. Better than store bought!

These were fantastic....that coming from an Italian New Yorker (me) should say something :-)  
A couple things I noticed...don't be alarmed by the stickiness of the dough...do not be tempted to add more flour!  I just oiled up my hands and was able to easily handle the dough....  Also...I think 25 minutes is way too long to bake these....  I baked them for about 18 minutes or so, then took them out, sliced them with a pizza cutter while still hot, then turned them on their sides to finish "toasting"... they came out great!  I look forward to trying different variations of the recipe, too!

As the submitter states, this definitely is a "no frills" biscotti.  The dough was a little sticky so I put them on a well floured surface to form them. I'm making this for a friend of mine whose baby is teething and wants a hard little cookie for her to sort of chew on.  I made half with anise extract for Mom to go with her tea and half with just vanilla for the baby.  I put them into little clear bags tied with wire ribbon for a nice presentation.

This recipe was fabulous!  I got an itch to make biscotti, never made it before and they were WONDERFUL.  I made 4 different kinds - Almond, chocolate raspberry with cocoa, raspberry extract and dark chocolate pieces, dark chocolate with bittersweet baking chocolate and cocoa, and the favorite was eggnog made with real eggnog (one less egg and a bit more flour to make it the right consistency) and nutmeg, cinnamon and clove.  These were a big hit.  *****Here's a tip - the dough is sticky, and so to make it easier to manage I used parchment lined baking sheets and formed the biscotti right on the sheet between 2 sheets of parchment paper - no mess.  You can use extra flour but the more flour you use, the tougher they get.

I would like to thank Jandee for letting me share in the pleasure of making this recipe for my family...my son now feels (age 17) that I do not have anything left in the house to eat if I do not have Biscotti on hand.. I made this recipe for Xmas and it turned out great..only a few changes..I have a really hard time leaving recipes alone..Sorry.... I added vanilla, and almond flavoring instead of the anaise. A pinch of salt added alittle also..and finely chopped pecans...a wee bit of flour while rolling out on the board and ended up sprinkling a bit of icing sugar on the outside...really tasty..when done I also melted ch.chips with a bit of butter and drizzled it over the top, and sprinkled finely chopped pecans over that....REALLY GREAT..at least my son says so...I plan to have them on hand and I found the recipe very easy to work with...especially the fact that you can change it to so many different flavors..and make them as crispy or soft as you like them.... Thanks again.....

Easy and foolproof. I get requests for these biscotti all of the time. Endless variations. My favorite: replace 1/2 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of Cocoa, increase sugar to 1 + 1/3 cup total (or to taste). Stir in toasted, slivered almonds. Add a splash of amaretto instead of anise extract. Yummy!~

I got interrupted  while making these yseterday ...I had reached the point where I was to add flour to the eggs so I put the egg mix in the fridge & then forgot about it. This morning I remembered & got back after it. I didn't have any problems in forming them into a roll...maybe it helped having the egg & sugar mixture very cool? I did not add the extract, instead I took the suggestion of ZZZORBA & added 1/2 tsp each cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg & coriander. They smelled fantastic! I divide the dough in hlaf & added chopped, dried cherries to half a batch & then dunked the ends in white chocolate after baking. I also cut them as soon as I could touch them for fear of them crumbling (none did). Thansk Jandee...they're wonderful!

I received rave reviews from this biscotti recipe.  My husband thought it was better than storebought.  I added 1/2 cup dried chopped cranberres and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Excellent!
Feb 2004 - I decided to try them again and make them lower in carbohydrates.  Here's what I did and they STILL turned out great.  You cannot do anything wrong with this recipe...it always turns out!!
Substitutes:
- Sugar Substitute (Splenda) for real sugar
- 2 cups flour - 1.25 cups of whole wheat flour.  Next time I may even try whole wheat flour with soy flour to add more protein and lesser carbs.
Dec 2011 - Still an outstanding recipe!  Added 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1/2 cup dried cranberries.  10/10!!

This  is an excellent biscotti recipe. I gave it a try today and it turned out beautiful. I doubled the recipe as I always like to give some to my friends and I added 1 cup of roasted crushed almonds. As I did not have any anise extract, I added almond extract.  I will definitely make them again and again. I followed the recipe and the rest was very easy. Thank you.

Turned out great!  This was my first time making biscotti, I separated the dough and added 1/2 TBSP anise to half the mixture and for the other half, I added 1/2 TBSP of vanilla extract, 1 tsp of almond extract, and 1/4 cup of slivered almonds.  I cooked them for 20 minutes, cooled them for 2 minutes and sliced with a pizza cutter like other reviewers recommended.  Then I put them back in (biscuits on their sides) for 5 minutes, then flipped them to the other side and did another 5 minutes.  They came out perfect!

I was searching for a biscotti recipe for a gift basket I was making and decided to give this one a try.  Believe me, I made the right choice!!  Not only was it easy, it was also fairly quick for biscotti, it tasted wonderful ( I made a few adjustments), and my family and the gift basket recipient thought that it tasted GREAT!!  It is now a permanent fixture in my personal recipe file and I recommend it to all my friends!  That is if they aren't having me making it for them!  If you're wondering what changes I made, they were 1) replacing the anise with almond extract, 2) adding about 3/4 cup of medium-fine chopped walnuts and 3) brushing the finished biscotti with a layer of melted white chocolate OR vanilla flavored candy-making pieces.  Whether you leave it exactly the way the recipe reads or make a few changes, this recipe is the TOPS!!!  Thanx, Jandee, for sharing it!!   Marguerite

This recipe saved the day when I had to make a lot of cookies for a church party and had no butter or shortening in the house! It is simple to make, not too sweet, and has a nice crunch. It's a great basic recipe and adapts well to add-ins like spices, extracts, mini chocolate chips, whatever! But be careful that whatever you add is chopped up in very small peices or else it the biscotti may crumble when you slice it. Some flavorful additions I recommend are yuzu rind(or lemon if you can't find yuzu fruit) and nutmeg, dried cranberries and toasted almonds, and toasted coconut and chocolate.

This recipe is far greater than store bought biscottis.  They're easy to make - I prefer almond and vanilla extract and I add chopped almonds or walnusts to the recipe.  I add more flour since what the recipe calls for isn't quite enough.  I'm excited about this recipe.  I keep biscottis on hand now -- all the time!!!!

I used almond extract instead of anise...and added more flour because the amount called for left it too sticky/glue like and hard to work with... when they were done and cooled I dipped one end in white chocolate..placed them on wax paper and let them harden in fridge.  DELICIOUS!

I never cared for biscotti till I started making this recipe. Store boughten is too hard and not all that flavorful.. With this recipe I have made many different flavors, Lemon  with lemon extract   with lemon zest and iced with white chocolate with a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract mixed in the white chocolate..Orange  with orange extract  and orange zest, white chocolate icing. Spiced with 1/4 tsp each cinnamon,cloves,nutmeg and coriander with white chocolate icing. Almond and vanilla, sometimes add nuts or mimi choc chips.Every flavor has turned out wonderful.....I am making coconut biscotti tomorrow with coconut extract and shredded coconut.Also after the first baking,I sliced and baked 6 minutes per side,nice crunch we can bite into. Thank You for this recipe it has become a family favorite.....

These are "no frills."  Not much flavor, and I had to add extra flour to get the dough "heavy" so I could shape it.

My son recently moved across the country and I wanted to mail him some cookies for the holiday, biscotti was recommended. I tried this recipe and was extremely pleased with the results, they were so good that I nearly didn't have enough to mail! For packing I wrapped the biscotti into a long rectangular block with foil and slipped it into a bottle gift box. Awesome. This recipe is very tweakable for flavor and add-ins, I used a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a cup of chopped pecans. My son wrote to me that they went so well with his coffee. Proud and happy Mom here. If you must mail cookies then biscotti make the trip well, and this recipe is the one to use. Can't say enough good things about it!

Since i couldn't find my original biscotti recipe, I stumbled upoon this one and it's a keeper!  Simple ingredients to keep on hand! I don't care for anise, so I subbed Almond Extract instead. Great flavor and took  no time at all to make and bake. I did undercook by 10 minutes and did not wait for the loaves to fully cool...it makes slicing them easier and less crumbly. Lightly wet hands when forming the loaf to cure the sticky problem. I topped them with chocolate drizzle and gave them as gifts to my office colleagues.  They were raving all day. Thanks for my new biscotti recipe!

needed to make cookies for work, and boy do these fit the bill. i made the original recipe only adding a pinch of salt, and chopped cocco powder roasted almonds that i had left over from making witches fingers,, next batch i changed to vanilla extract w/ cocca powder and peanut butter chips, next batch again i used vanilla extract, 3/4 c mini choc chips w/1 cup chopped pecans... they are all yummy and very easy to make. thank you for the recipe. oh yes, i did add a pinch of salt to all the batches as it brings out the flavors. use wet hands to form the logs, bake for 25 minutes then 7 minutes a side, perfect!

They are absolutely fabulous! I didn't have anise,so I added a tbl of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Followed the directions otherwise and cut them w/the pizza cutter while still warm flipped them on their side and put them back in the oven like the recipe states. They are delish! Oh, I also added 1/4 cup crushed almonds.

I had never made biscotti before, and decided to start with this recipe.  So glad I did!  I had no anise, and added half vanilla and half almond extract instead.  I mixed it in my Kitchen Aid, and added some chopped dried cranberries at the end.  I had no trouble with the dough since I kept my hands wet while I was handling it.  I formed them into logs right on the parchment-lined cookie sheet, then patted them down to 1/2" thickness.  They were done in 20 minutes, so I was glad I was keeping an eye on them.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion, and cut them immediately with a pizza cutter....so quick and easy, and no crumbling!  I turned down the oven to 325, then baked them again on each side for 6 minutes.  The texture is just what I wanted, and they are delicious!  I can't wait to try again using some other flavor combinations.

I substituted:
1/2 C melted butter for the oil
1 tsp almond extract + 1 tsp vanilla extract for the anise

And also added extra flour for manageability.

omg...this was hands down the best biscotti recipe i've tried.  years past when i made them...they would come out rock hard, not so good...but this one...wow.  using olive oil over other recipes that used butter made such a difference!  firm, but not so hard...tastes good by itself or dunked in coffee.  for me, i can't have biscotti plain, so i added slivered almonds (toasted), and chunks of white chocolate.  soooo good! and easy too! i took the advice of others, and cut the dough as soon as i took it out of the oven; cooling it makes it more difficult to cut.  and when i was initially shaping the logs (i got two), i placed alot of olive oil on my hands so it wouldn't stick to me.  i don't have anise extract (never even knew that existed!), so i substituted 1/2 T almond extract and 1/2T vanilla.  Yummy in my tummy! sharing is optional with this one! :D  thanks for this awesome recipe!

Awesome! It's a pretty classic recipe so I doubled it the first time round. The cookies are in the oven toasting as I type and some of them didn't make it to the second stage! Oops! I'm gonna try orange oil next with a white chocolate cream cheese glaze.

This is the 4th biscotti recipe I've made from this site and it is THE BEST.  I liked all the others, but this one is absolutely outstanding!  I'll only use this recipe from now on, and make different variations - - THANKS for the post.

Fantastic!! So simple and so tasty.  Batch after batch is identical and perfectly shaped. I used a stick of butter instead of the vegetable oil. In addition to the Anise extract, I added 1 tsp. of Anise seed. I used 7 minutes baking for each cut surface for the "second bake." For some really delicious flavor, coat one surface of the cookie with melted semi-sweet Belgian cooking chocolate. They taste and look like expensive store-bought Biscotti from a famous bakery in California. This is a "winner." Thank you Jandee for this recipe.

I never knew biscotti could be so easy to prepare!  This recipe was very tasty, and I was pleased with how it turned out on my first attempt!!!  The second time I tried it I used orange extract, and then added some chopped vanilla chips.  I also drizzled them with some melted white chips at the end.  A lovely presentation!

I never realized how simple it is to make biscotti!  My dad's birthday is today and I wanted to make him some biscotti as a surprise, because he loves them but rarely gets to have them because they're so expensive.  I used this recipe as a base and made a couple of minor changes so I could replicate his favorite biscotti from Costco - Nonni's brand.  Instead of anise extract, I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of almond extract and I folded about 1-1/2 cups of almond pieces into the dough.  I did have to add about 1/4 cup extra flour to the dough and, even then, it was still pretty sticky.  I just scooped it onto my Silpat lined baking sheets and then formed the loaves with moistened hands instead of trying to make a log and then flatten it.  During the first part of baking, my loaves started to burn on the bottom at 20 minutes, so I took them out.  After slicing, I baked the cookies for 5 minutes, then flipped them over and baked for another 5 minutes so both sides would get toasted nicely.  I dipped the bottom of each cookie in melted bittersweet chocolate and then drizzled more bittersweet chocolate over one cut side of each cookie.  They taste fantastic and look beautiful!  I can't wait to give them to my dad this evening!!

My first attempt at biscotti.  I had to add a little water to the mixture.  It was too crumbly and wouldn't hold together.  I used orange extract and orange rind.  Very tasty.  Will make this again.

Perfect! This recipe is perfect for customizing. To add extracts/nuts/anise seeds etc: Cream butter and sugar, add eggs. Next, add zest, extracts or liquors and mix until well blended. (If you add too much extract, your mixture may curdle. Don't worry! Just add the flour mixture quickly.) Add dry ingredients and mix until just blended. Add anything chunky (choc. chips, nuts, dried fruit etc). I made plain ones (delicious!) and a second batch with 2 tsp lemon zest, 3/4c dried cranberries, 3/4c almonds 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2tsp anise seed. Drizzle with a little white chocolate. Not sure why, but the customized recipe spread a little more than the plain version, so leave extra room on your baking sheets! 

The lemon/cranberry version was some of the best biscotti I've ever had. Thank you for sharing.

My first time making biscotti was triumphant! I added chopped almonds though next time I will chop them smaller to make for easier slicing. I replaced the anise with lemon essence.

Excellent!!!  Followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly.  My advice would be let the biscotti cool COMPLETELY before slicing.  I know this is difficult because you are anxious to get to that next step so they can be done and you can clean up, but, if you try to slice them while they are even slightly warm you will have a lot of crumbling and breakage.  I baked the logs last night, let them sit overnight (covered) and then this morning sliced them with a serrated knife - virtually no breakage.  Then I did the toasting step.  Finally for fun, I melted some Hershey bars in a ziplock bag in the mnicrowave, snipped off a corner and piped the chocolate along the tops of the biscotti, and it drizzled down the sides......pretty professional looking!  To get holiday festive try it with white chocolate melted and some red or green food coloring mixed in.  This is a perfect classic biscotti recipe!

delicious and easy to make.  I also like the fact that it is made with oil instead of butter...a little healthier.  Its versatile as well, accepting add-ins well.  Try it with cranberries, white choc chunks & pistachios, omitting the anise (use vanilla) and adding grated orange peel. Yum!

These are great with a few changes.  I add about 1/4 cup of finely chopped pecans OR walnuts plus 1/4 cup (or less) of finely chopped sliced almonds.  In order to prevent the cookies from crumbling when sliced, I cut them straight out of the oven.  I don't let them cool at all.  Be careful not to burn yourself.  I wear mits.  Also I drizzle the biscotti's with melted white and milk chocolate.  Really look gourmet and taste great too!!!  Thanks for the simple but yet very tasty recipe!!!

This was my first attempt at biscotti and it turned out really good.  I didn't have the anise, so I used almond extract.  As another reviewer stated, this recipe is easily adjustable.  These tasted ok the first day, but after leaving them in the fridge overnight, they became dryer and the taste was better.  My 2 little ones enjoyed these, but hubby said the almond extract gave him a headache.....oh well!  These are great dipped in hot coffee.  Thanks for sharing Jandee.

Simple, fast & tasty! With only 4 basic ingredients and about an hour from start to finish. These taste great - I got rave reviews from friends. I used about 1/2 cup more flour to make dough easier to handle. Instead of anise extract, I used  2 Tbs of butter-nut extract and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. For second baking, it took about 5 minutes on each side to get the biscotti browned to suit me. Lastly, I topped them off with drizzled chocolate & nuts. I plan to try them next with lemon extract and topped with melted lemon chips.

This was my first time making biscotti and it turned out great. It was better than some I had tried from the store. I used vanilla extract instead of the anise. It only lasted 3 days & it was all gone. I dipped half of it in a melted down chocolate candy bar. I can't beleive how easy this was. I also used bread flour because that's all I had on hand. I'll make this again real soon. This was very inexpensive too compared to commercial products. Thanks Jandee for sharing this with everyone. I'm going to experiment with this and try some different flavors. I'll keep you posted...Phil

I have been searching for a top-notch Biscotti recipe to serve in a country club to a large group of biscotti connoisseurs. None I have tried have measured up to their standard--until this recipe! As written, it's wonderful. I have tried both anise and almond extract. For that traditional flavor, the anise is best. The instructions have this recipe dividing the dough into two rectangles. I serve a smaller biscotti, so I divide it one more time and make four rectangles, then adjust baking time accordingly. The tip for baking until crisp, then removing to slice is great advice. Before returning them to the oven, they will brown more evenly if you separate the pieces (half inch, give or take) and turn them upright.  I received a lot of requests to make them crisper and darker, so I place the dough on parchment paper, spray with nonstick spray, and place directly on the rack in the oven. Thank you for sharing!!

I've made this 4-5 times now. I like it because its easy, but it do sometimes have problems with the loaf crumbling a bit when I cut it. I have tried letting it cool more and letting it cool less before cutting. But all in all, I really like it. Made it today and subbed 1/4 cup flour for 1/4 cup cocoa powder and made chocolate biscotti. Turned out great.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't use anise - but only because I was making them to give to my dad and I wasn't sure he would like it.  I used half vanilla and half almond like another reviewer did.   I will make these again myself for myself and use the anise!  I love how perfectly these baked and cut!

This recipe is great. The only thing I changed was (like many)the anise extract. I used one tsp. of vanilla extract and one tsp. of almond instead.  When I first made the dough it was so sticky and I took the dough out of the mixing bowl and placed it on a pieces of foil. It wouldn't come off the foil so I put it in the fridge for a few mins. and it peeled right off. I greased my hands and the foil then it work marvelously . The biscotti was amazing :) I drizzled it with chocolate.

I've just discovered how easy biscotti is to make and this is the best recipe so far! I've made several variations on this recipe, adding things to the basic batch. Adding 1/2 cup of nuts and chocolate chips, 1/8 cup cocoa and chocolate chips to make chocolate-chocolate chip biscotti; butter flavor and pecans for butter-pecan biscotti.  To make sure mine is crisp, I turn the oven off after the second ten minutes of baking and let them cool in the oven.
This recipe makes a perfect start, then add whatever you like.

This recipe is simple and works beautifully! I found that putting the dough into the fridge for a bit before shaping it on the cookie sheet helped it to be more manageable (and less sticky).

Turned out amazing! I was especially pleased because I had no idea what I was doing. Very simple recipe. I used vanilla extract instead of anise and I used a different baking method. I baked the rolled dough for 10 minutes, removed from oven, sliced, and then cooked the sliced for 5 minutes on each side.

This is a fabulous biscotti recipe. Like others have noted it takes well to additions (so far I have tried different chopped nuts, different extracts and different types of flour (1 part whole wheat to 2 parts all purpose was great!).  I have made this recipe several times in the past month - I can't keep them in the cookie jar.  Try sprinking the tops of the logs with cinnamon sugar before the first baking - yummy!  Love these, I now make them all the time!

This is the first time I've tried to make Biscotti.  It was fast, easy and very tasty.  I made one batch with the anise extract and one with almond extract and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds.  Both are delicious!

Delicious and so, so easy to make. I've made this so many times over the years that I've memorized the recipe. Like other people, I use 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tbsp almond extract instead of anise. If I'm making it for my mother, I decrease the sugar to about 3/4 cup for less sweet cookie. I always slice the large roll right out of the oven so it doesn't get all crumbly after it cools. I also find that melting some quality dark chocolate, pouring it into a shallow dish, dipping the smooth round side of the biscotti in it, then sprinkling sliced almonds on top makes for an amazing presentation. I've also drizzled white and dark chocolate over the top with a fork, but I don't like it as much. If I could give this more stars, I would! Thanks for an incredible recipe!

Just returned from Italy last week and felt the need to make biscotti.  These are great!!  Easy to assemble, not crumbly, dry out in the oven.  I made them with anise and added almonds.  I made a second batch without anise and added 3 T. fresh squeezed lemon juice, zest of a lemon and a tsp. lemon extract.  They are delicious!

Just made this for the first time ever, biscotti, that is. It turned out GREAT! I scaled the recipe down with the calculator, and used almond extract instead of anise (for I hate the taste of anise, fennel, and licorice with a firey passion). It's a very versatile recipe (i.e. chopped nuts and dried fruits can be added if one chooses). Also, doing an egg or milk wash over the dough makes it prettier, but that step isn't totally necessary. All in all, I will probably use this as a base for all my future biscotti endeavors.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could because it's an excellent, easy, base recipe that produces the perfect texture with minimal ingredients and effort.  I've made chocolate chip biscotti, cranberry walnut, maple pecan and chocolate walnut all using this recipe as a base.  The dough is sticky so I spray my hands with non-stick spray when forming it into a roll & patting it down.  I bake it closer to 20 minutes for the first bake and cut them with a straight, sharp, large knife by just pushing straight down immediately out of the oven.  For the second bake I lower the temp to 300 and bake them until they're dry, about 20-25 minutes.  I've tried many biscotti recipes and this is by far my favorite!  Thank you!

Like many others, I used 1 tbsp each of almond and vanilla extract in place of anise, and I tossed 1/4 tsp cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in. It was very mild-flavored and not as sweet as I expected. Next time I make it I will consider adding maybe 1/4 C more sugar. 

To condense suggestions from other reviews, do not add flour to make the dough less sticky and easier to handle; keep your hands wet and keep rinsing them off when the dough starts to stick while you're shaping it. As soon as you pull the two rolls from the oven transfer both rolls to a cutting board and cut them while they're still soft (place them on the cutting board to avoid scratching the baking pan and also because only one roll, once each piece is laid on its side, will fit in the pan at a time). 

Try toasting the pieces once they've been laid on their side for 5 minutes; check to see whether they need another minute, and then flip them over to toast the other side for 5 minutes.

These biscotti are delicious!  I have made the mocha recipe from here a couple of times, and they are good, but these are classic.  I did use almond extract instead of the anise since they are at least in part for gifts and I didn't know if the recipients like the taste of licorice.  Next time I will add some sliced or chopped almonds for texture.  My only complaint is that the dough is extrememly sticky.    It stuck to the bowl, my beaters, wooden spoon, everything.  Including the wax paper I used as recommended to keep it from sticking to my hands.  A little water on my hands did help some, however I might have had a few more cookies if it didn't stick so much.   I highly recommend these for taste, though!

I have been using this recipe ever since I found it a few years ago. It is definetly one of my favorites and one of the most requested each year.
I just want everyone to know how easy and good this is. You can use other flavoring but the Anise is one of the traditional Italian flavors.
Thank you for posting it and I'm sorry I took so long to rate it.

I love Biscotti, I am Italian and have baked a lot of Biscotti, THIS IS A WINNER! I cut the recipe in half, I used EVOO because that is the only oil I use, I used vanilla rather than anise as my hubby is not really a fan of it, and I dusted the dough lightly with flour as it was incredibly wet and sticky before I put it on the cookie sheet. 
Light, crunchy without being to hard, DELICIOUS! 
I will definitely make again and again!

I've made this many times-- even on weeknights, which is saying something! And I can leave off at any point for my daughter to finish them--that's how easy the recipe is. We've done many variations on flavors, and the biggest crowd pleaser was coconut extract, chopped macadamia nuts, and melted white chocolate (with more extract) drizzled on top. Other hit combos: black walnut extract and dark chocolate topping, lemon poppyseed and vanilla white chocolate topping...we have people who call us and place "orders," that's how good this recipe is! The only thing I've tweaked is to add a quarter teaspoon of salt. I think it heightens the flavor a bit.

I love biscotti and this is a simple, basic, no-frills version of Italian biscotti.  Although this is not a “stiletto” but more a “flip-flop” version of biscotti, there is a lot to be said for “flip-flops.”   I’ll relax in my jeans and flip-flops with a cup of coffee and this biscotti any day– life is good.  LOVED it!

Look up the reviewer ANITALOUISE.  I followed her suggestions exactly and had great results.  I tried another recipe that used butter and found it to be crumbly and difficult.  The oil makes the difference!

These were really good!  They were quick and simple to make.  The only change I made was that I used half Tbsp. vanilla extract and half Tbsp. almond extract  instead of the anise.  The dough was very easy to work with.  I dipped the bottoms of half the batch in melted chocolate.  My hubby preferred them without the chocolate, but these are good with or without.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow!! These are FANTASTIC.This is the first time I have ever made Biscotti and They turned out wonderful.I used almond extract in place of the anise extractand I added about 1 cup of cherry flavored craisins and some white chocolate morsels.After they cooled I frosted bottom side with melted white morsels and dipped them in broken almond slices. YUMMY ! YUMMY ! I will be making these again.

This is a wonderful and super easy recipe.  I modified 1/4 c oil and 1/4 c butter as suggested by so many other reviewers and followed what AnitaLouise recommended for shaping (directly on the cookie sheet) and cutting (pizza cutter)...both suggestions were perfect for making this recipe easier to execute. I made two different kinds--leaving out the Anise extract (1) 1 T orange extract/toasted slivered almonds/1 T orange zest/2/3 cup dried canberries and (2) chocolate chip and toasted pecans...both were a hit and every asked for my recipe.  Fabulous, I'm already planning my next flavor combinations (Lemon and Blueberry I think....).

This was my first time making Biscotti and I have to say this was great. I don't think I will ever buy store Biscotti again!
My first time out I was daring and added zest of one medium size orange and crushed  up some almonds I had on hand. I didn't use anise (I only had vanilla. Th dough is sticky so I divided it with a large spoon and smoothed it out on a cookie sheet like frosting. I also took advise from someone else on here and bought a Hershey's bar and melted it in the microwave, put it in a sandwich bag, snipped the end and drizzled it over the finished Biscotti. I will make these as a gift next time.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I did follow the review below and added 1/2 tbs almond extract & 1/2 tbs vanilla extract ..very good...this was my first time making biscotti- i found this recipe very easy didnt require a lot of ingredients...i did find that the dough was very very sticky (could not handle it to shape it) so i spooned half the dough into a lightly greased bread load pan, patted the dough down to flatten it in the loaf pan then turned it over on the greased cookie sheet...then i just patted the top of the dough on the cookie sheet to spread it out...absolutly perfect no stick mess to deal with and the perfect shap for biscotti...A+++++ ( i also swirled dark chocolate and white chocolate on on cut side of the biscotti once it was completely cooled)

the only change i made was substituting almond extract for the anise as i couldnt find anise anywhere! it turned out fantastic, i have made biscotti once before and it was terrible, but i followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. next time i might substitute cinamon extract or vanilla for the anise, or drizzle with chocolate to give an extra bit of flavor.

This is a really simple but good biscotti recipe. I would reccomend this to anyone but especially people who are making biscotti for the first time. I don't like anise so I used vanilla and almond extract, I also added chopped almonds. I made them for my dad and by the end of the day the whole batch was gone!

This is the best basic biscotti recipe ever!  I made them as a quick last minute Holiday gift for my friends the night before Winter Faire (the last day of school before winterbreak starts) and everybody was impressed!  I melted a few chocolate chips and drizzled the cooled biscotti with the chocolate before wrapping them in cellophane.  They looked so professional that some people thought I bought them!  I didn't have anise extract, so I used vanilla istead.  Awesome recipe!

These biscotti are great, easy, and delicious. I made a lot of biscotti recipes before, but this is the best. I was always looking for biscotti recipes that use oil instead of butter to minimize the fat and cholesterol, and this is exactly what I wanted. I used 1 teaspoon of anise seed for each cup of flower instead of anise extract, and it came out great, full of the anise taste that I love. My husband also liked them a lot. Thanks for this recipe; I will definitely make it again.

This is the easiest recipe I have ever come across for biscotti!!  I substituted vanilla because I had no anise, the dough was sticky yet managable, no need for extra flour.  I also dipped one side in chocolate (1 bag of nestle semi-sweet morsels melted in the microwave).  Crispy, almost flaky and just the right sweetness!!  The only thing I will change the next time is make one roll so the cookies end up longer.  Definitely a keeper!!

I tried this recipe THREE times following the ingredients and directions to the letter, and found it too try to form a dough.  Other reviewers mentionned they had to add more flour -- I found 2 cups of flour to be about right.  Maybe I've missed some crucial step, but after making it three times I've completely given up on this recipe.

This is great...they taste just like Nonni's Biscotti.  I didn't have a problem with sticky dough:  I lightly floured my counter and my hands and rolled the dough into one large rectangle half inch thick and baked on parchment paper.  I used 1 1/2 tsp. almond extract plus 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and chopped cranberries and chopped almonds in the dough.  I also melted some chocolated chips and coated the biscotti.  I had great results with this recipe!  My kids say I have to make more.  Thanks Jandee!

Very good, very simple.  I only had vanilla extract on hand - I also added some chopped pecans.  When they were finished I dipped one side in semi sweet chocolate and coated with more chopped pecans.  Delightlful!  I can definitely see there are many ways to vary this receipe.  Thanks!

As written, the recipe is plain, but by no means does that make it bad! I imagine that even without my additions, this recipe make a very refined and tasty treat to be eaten with a hot beverage of your choice. When I made it, I subbed the anise extract for 1.5 tb of vanilla extract and I added about 1/3 cup of slivered almonds. I scorched the bottoms of the biscotti on the lower rack in my oven, so be watchful of your racks. I baked them for the minimum time suggested, and only toasted them for 4 minutes on each side. Try adding fruits/nuts/chocolates of your choice and subbing the anise for your favourite flavours- this recipe leaves a lot of wiggle room for trying new things!

Watch out! 1 cup here means 238 ml!

I've tried making it once using 250 ml as 1 cup. Like many one-starred ratings say, the dough was too dry to even make it into a dough.
I immediately made a second batch using a 238 ml cup as 1 cup to measure. Voila! The dough looks much more like a normal heavy cookie dough.

That's the difference between 769 ml of flour vs. 812.5 ml of flour. Major difference.

After it's baked, I cut it almost right away, without letting it cool.
It didn't crumble on me, which is a success.

It taste good considering it requires little time and effort.

Flavor and crunch factor are great!  I've had this problem with many biscotti recipes--this review isn't  directed  specifically for this particular recipe.  I've ALWAYS had a problem cutting the biscotti logs after they have been baked for the first time, getting frustrated with each broken slice. I can't begin to tell you how many times I've ended up with crumbled biscotti. I got the idea to "score" the unbaked logs, while on the parchment lined cookie sheet.  I don't cut diagonal slices.  I "score" across each unbaked log with a sharp knife-being careful not to cut all the way through.  I try to cut them about 1/2' each.  Follow the directions to continue baking.  Hopefully this will help to solve the issues with crumbling biscotti.

I am Italian and THESE cookies I will actually bake and give away. I added 1 tablespoon flavouring according to what add-ins I chose and baked at 350F for 25 minutes, sliced with a bread knife and rebaked for 5 minutes each side. VERY VERSATILE recipe. Proud to be Italian!

After talking to someone else...I believe that recipe should say 1 tsp, not 1 tbsp, of anise. That is why my cookies are so bitter. Ugh!

Made this for a bunko group.  It was a hit.  I wasnt sure if everyone would like anise, so used vanilla and added cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and coriander as another reviewer suggested, also used a very good olive oil and whole wheat pastry flour.  Was very good and easy to make.  I am excited to try it with the anise flavor!!

I made this recipe today and can't stop eating it. I added lemon juice and lemon zest for the flavoring, along with chopped almonds. Delicious recipe. First time I have ever had a Biscotti. Will be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

Simple and a snap to make- and delicious to eat! I love the traditional anise flavor! I used my pizza stone (put in the oven while preheating to make it good and hot for baking) and found it to be a snap. No need to grease and great for the second baking with the biscotti on their bottoms with the sides exposed and some space between slices.

simple, low fat and delish! I just added cinnamon and nutmeg and substituted anise for almond extract.  Thanks for sharing, I am sure I'll find many ways to use this....I may add crunched up candy canes for xmas.

This recipe was absolutely perfect! This would be a great base for add-ins. I prepared the dough, formed it into two logs, and baked the first one. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut it into slices with a pizza cutter while still hot. What a breeze!
Also, I noticed that the second log (which sat for a while) rose more in the oven. Maybe next time, I'll let the logs sit before I bake them. 
And by the way, this is Rocco DiSpirito's recipe, so I guess you could call it authentic!

This recipe is quick and easy! I substituted almond extract for the anise and added sliced almonds only for personal preference. I'm italian so I have a lot of baking competition in the family, but everyone loved these and asked for my secret recipe!

This is the BEST biscotti recipe this Sicilian girl has ever made!  The beauty is in it's simplicity. I've also made them with orange extract and almond extract.  I like a lot of flavor, so I've increased all extract amounts to 2 tablespoons (1 oz).  It's difficult to roll the dough, so I do the following: place half the dough on your parchment on the baking sheet.  Roll the dough back and forth.  You might need to anchor your baking sheet, hold the parchment with one hand and roll the dough with the other hand.  It will easily roll out and, and can be repositioned as needed.  I like soft biscotti, so I skip the toasting step.  I cut the biscotti when they are barely warm to touch.  They remain soft for the few days they last in my house, stored in a tight biscotti jar. I continually make these when the previous batch is gone. So simple!!  Thank you JANDEE for sharing this recipe!

I didn't know biscotti was so easy! My only change was omitting half of the sugar, which I thought was more than enough, especially after putting in chopped fruits and nuts. I will definitely make this again!

I made the basic recipe tonight and the flavor was great! This would also be good with macadamia nuts.. I will add those in my next batch! You could almost change anything or add anything into the recipe and they would turn out great.. of course keeping to the almond extract. ( I also didn't have anise).

I made these for gifts at a Christmas tea and everyone loved them! I omitted the anise and used pure vanilla extract. I used a confectioners glaze with added almond extract from this site to coat one side and then lightly dusted with red sugar, wrapped several in clear gift bags and tied a greeting with festive ribbon...too cute and these were very delicious!

Great basic recipe but next time I MUST add goodies (nuts, dried fruit, chips, etc.) or drizzle w/ chocolate.  Otherwise too plain.  Used vanilla and almond extracts instead of anise (used more than recipe called for)

Very easy to do recipe! Thanks - I changed though flavouring with 1 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and added 1/2 cup slivered almonds for texture and a bit of crunchiness. I also made a batch with butter instead of vegetable oil which makes the biscotti taste more creamier...

I've been making this biscotti recipe for so long, I figure it's time for a review! It's a great recipe, and a good base to start with if you like adding in different things. For example, I always use 1 tsp of cinnamon and also use vanilla instead of anise. Recently I've added in chocolate chips, which were good (of course, how can you go wrong with chocolate?). They keep really well too. I love the crunch of this cookie, and I like that it doesn't use butter.

The first time I made these biscottis, I accidentially used 3 cups of flour. They came out GREAT! My next batch, I included the forgotten 1/4 cup of flour and they became OK (not so good as the first batch). So, I recommend try using less flour.

I've made these for Christmas presents for my 21mo daycare friends. Some parents told me that they ate them all before their kids could get a bite. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing!

this recipe is great! i love the anise flavor, but occasionally i will omit the anise and add the grated peel of an orange or lemon along with (1 cup) chopped almonds, pecans, walnuts, or semi-sweet chocolate pieces (any combination of the above works well). 

i've also found that using an electric bread knife to slice the straight-from-the-oven biscotti loaves works really well. also, i don't flatten the loaves before i put them in the oven, just spray pam on the cookie sheet, divide the dough into two long "logs." works perfectly for me every time.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars for texture, ease and appearance. I had absolutely no problems shaping or cutting these-- and they turned out beautifully. Just like store bought. However, I didn't have anise extract, so I used 1 tsp of almond and 2 tsp of vanilla, and while the flavour is still really good, it's not 5 stars (more like 4). Next time I'll use anise, or add cinnamon or something. The cookies are the perfect texture though, and I will definitely be using this recipe as a base for future biscotti.

Absolutely LOVED these!! Remember they increase in size when cooked-my first batch was to thick and took longer to cook. I also made a double batch, refridgerated the dough in plastic wrap and baked the next day with no problem.

AMAZING!!! All my friends rave about this biscotti.  really easy, CONSISTENT results.  A few pointers:
1.  sometimes I add a bit more flour to get good results
2.  adding almond extract as well and slivered almonds is wonderful!
3.  add some cocoa to make chocolate biscotti - adjust flour / oil if necessary to make them the right consistnecy!  
4.  This recipe is so versitle, Get a little creative with it!!

I made this with olive oil instead of vegetable oil (as in the cranberry-pistachio biscotti recipe that's so popular on this site). I think olive oil makes all the difference, but I also think this recipe would be good with just vegetable oil. It's a good, basic biscotti recipe, and you end up with a cookie that's not tooth-chippingly hard.

This was so easy and simply delicious!  Only changes I made were to add toasted walnuts and anise seeds to the batter, then when it was completed cooked through, I dipped some into chocolate and it was devine!  Hint: Watch them closely as they bake, they brown FAST!

A great basic recipe.  Versatile and easy to modify (I made several variations).  Not too sweet, so they are good with everything and perfect for chocolate-dipping.  Yum!

Great taste and texture. This Biscotti doesn't turn out too hard to bite into like some Biscotti. I did have to add a little flour to keep from sticking to my hands as I formed the dough, but no big deal. If you have never made Biscotti before, try this recipe.

I made these today. I used coconut oil and 1 of the 3 1/4 cups of flour I used coconut flour.  They came out so delicious. I also added some dried dates. I like taking biscotti to work to have with my midmorning coffee. 
Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe.

This is the best biscotti recipe out there!! I've been using this recipe for the last few years and have had so many compliments! My mom requests a batch just for her every Xmas. I've also had a co-worker, whose mother-in-law was Italian, tell me these are the closest thing to real Italian biscotti like her MIL used to make. I've also played around with the recipe sometimes adding dried fruits, nuts, other extracts, and dipped in chocolate. Everytime they are still perfect!!

I agree, no frills easy to make and slightly lacking in flavor. I did make these a second time and increased the amount of Anise, I used Anise seed -1 heaping Tablespoon ground in smaller pieces in a coffee grinder. I also took the advise of other posters and carefully sliced the loaf before it cooled- this avoided breaking them before the second baking. I like that these are not too sweet and that they are made with oil instead of butter as they are easier to make - oil is less expensive and I always have it in the cupboard.

Made these for Christmas gifts to go inside fun coffee mugs then had some out for Christmas morning.  My favorite is made with almond extract and one side covered in chocolate!

Finally leapt in and made this recipe. Glad I watched the video. They are wonderful. First time working with dough of this consistency and it went perfect. Adding almonds next time and there will be many next times!!!! Oh, I used light Olive oil...the best.

Great recipe!took the other reviewers advice and cut the loaves while they were still hot and they turned out beautifully. Did not add extra flour. Baked on parchment paper. Best biscotti recipe I have tried!

I have made this recipe 5 times so far and each time they have come out perfect. I have made the anise 3 times and have made 2 variations one being almond and today I made an orange chocolate chunk version. This recipe is perfect, nothing needs to be adjusted at all. Thank you so much for this recipe, I feel so blessed to have this recipe like I'm in on a total secret lol! I can't keep up with the thoughts of all the variations of this base recipe I want to try it's just enough to get all the ingredients for them... Thank you so much again!

Turned out great! Like others, I decreased the temp to 350 and the time to 20 minutes, then cut them and finished "toasting". If you're like me and forgot to pick up baking powder, use 1 TBS of vinegar in the wet mix and 3/4 tsp baking soda in the dry mix and turns out just as well. I also added toffee chips!! Mmmmmm! Can't wait to have a few of these with my morning coffee.

I made the original recipe and then made one using cocoa and Splenda. Splenda doesn't work--it makes the dough crumbly.
I used a pizza cutter immediately for the original recipe and it worked on the ends but not in the middle.  Next time will let top of dough get golden brown, not just up the sides.  The flavor is wonderful. Wetting my hands worked great...I put the dough on ungreased parchment paper on the cooky sheets.
I will try more this week and will report back.

Very good.  I used, as recommended by another reviewer, 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract because I couldn't find the anise.  You can't go wrong with using a full tablespoon of almond extract to add flavor. This is a very good plain biscotti base.  Get creative!  It could use some slivered almonds.  I dipped mine in chocolate. Thanks!

Great recipe!! My husband was eating them as I was trying to cut them up. Only thing I did difference was add a cup of chopped almonds. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and had not problems with the dough.

This was fantastic and easy (and I usually can't bake anything).  It worried me that it looked more like "crumbles" than dough but when I divided it into two pieces and rolled it, it was right.  I ate some that I cut off the ends after baking and it was delicious so I thought I'd get fancy and brush on a chocolate covering.  Well, I learned that you need to "temper" chocolate or it will melt in your hands as well as your mouth.  If you decide to do this same thing and are an inexperienced baker like me.  Look up "tempering chocolate" before you dip or brush chocolate on your biscotti.  The biscotti was great on it's own though and tasted better than the expensive store bought biscotti

Loved this recipe! I don't care for strong anise flavor, and this cookie is very mild. I made it "as is" for my 1st batch. This is going to be such a money saver, as we like to have a biscotti on the weekends with our coffee! I did have very good success using a thin plastic bowl scraper (3X5" with a rounded side)to shape the dough before baking. The dough did not stick to the scraper. I used my KitchenAid mixer to mix ingredients and a pizza cutter to cut the baked dough into strips.

I have tried many biscotti recipes in the past but this is the best recipe ever! It is very simple but yet has a wonderful texture and taste. For the holiday season I add candied red and green cherries for a more festive biscotti. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who is seeking the perfect biscotti! evapap Greece

5 stars for consistency and 3 for taste. Finally, a biscotti that has the right crunch, melts perfectly in your coffee or tea, and not chewy at all. Yea! But it seems more like a dry bread than a cookie. It wasn't sweet at all, even though I spread melted chocolate on one side. I made as stated except used almond extract since my husband doesn't really like anise but loves biscotti. I couldn't even taste the almond flavor even though I used a whole T. and some slivered almonds too. Next time, I will add more sugar and more extract too. Yes, I have to try it again since the consistency is perfect!

This was my first attempt at biscotti, and they turned out great!  I wanted to make something that would travel well, to mail to my son who is studying abroad.  I did substitute 1 t vanilla for the anise, since I don't care much for anise.  These were so easy to make, and I think my son will love them.  Thanks so much!  Update: son did indeed love them, they traveled great, and they kept in a sealed container for a few weeks!

This recipe was so easy, and the reviews so incredible that I too thought how could I possibly screw it up... But I did... I'm obviously the worst biscotti maker on the universe... The taste was good, but mine ended up being really crumbly yet still soft... Not sure what I did... This recipe is easy but still screw-upable

I used vanilla instead of anise and pulsed equal amounts of white chocolate chips and walnuts in my food processor before adding the dough.  They were absolutely amazing!!  I made half the batch without the walnuts and chips and they were boring by comparison, but the kids liked them dipped in hot cocoa.  :o)  They were perfect for Christmas morning!!!

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I tried making biscotti a couple of years ago, and it was a disaster.  This recipe seemed so easy, I figured I couldn't mess it up.  The only change I did was almond instead of anise (I don't have anise).  I can't wait to try other flavor options.

I made this just as described; cooking for slightly less time because I have an electric oven and it runs a little hot.  These were just lovely as is, with the anise!! They DO taste quite licorice-ey, though, so if you have an aversion to the stuff, perhaps cut down on the anise extract or substitute with another flavor. (My whole family loved the anise flavor!) I did follow the advice of another reviewer and oiled my hands to work with the sticky dough.  Even my husband, who hardly ever eats baked anything (he's a meat guy) gobbled them up!  I am adding 3/4 cup cranberries, some orange zest, and 1 Cup almonds with 1 T almond extract for Christmas!

YUM-O!  I used almond extract and a vanilla bean to flavor mine.  Scraped the inside and added it to the mixture.  The perfect cross between just sweet enough but not too sweet.  Oh...and you won't break your teeth biting into this one!  LOVED IT!  Tastes like a pro made it!

I was very hesitant to use this recipe because there was no butter involved in making them. I am so thankful I tried it anyway:) It is by far the BEST biscotti I've ever had. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

Oh, my!  I made this with almond flavor instead of anise since my sons are not fond of anise and they went nuts!  This will be my go to recipe and I cannot than you enough Jandee for sharing!  Simple and delightful!  I went from a 4-star to a 5- star because my husband who does not like biscotti liked this!  I am playing with the recipe right now adding dried cherries. Forget a diet!

Excellent steadfast recipe!  Easy to change once you get the consistency right.  Yesterday we made them into "healthy kids biscotti" by adding 1 cup of wheat germ and 2 - 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour.  We also changed the 3 eggs to 8 egg whites.  Our favorite flavours...orange, cranberry and white chocolate.  Very fun family activity and makes a charming gift for teachers!

This is the best and the easiest biscotti recipe ever!
I made the original recipe first.  Then I made a second batch with almonds, toffee crunch and used almond extract.  Excellent.  The third batch (in two days) consisted of vanilla extract with fresh chopped herbs (basil, rosemary, thyme and sage).  Lovely.  Used a lemon icing on these.  Can't get enough of these wonderful cookies.

This is a delicious, simple recipe that serves as a wonderful base for flavor experimentation. I made exactly as instructed, except added macadamia nuts to the dough and drizzled white chocolate on the biscotti once out of the oven and cooled. Everyone loved them!

This was my first time trying to make Biscotti.  Although I love cooking and baking, about half the things I make 'flop.'  To my surprise, this recipe worked out perfectly!  I used Almond Extract instead of Anise and, at another review suggestion, I pulled mine out of the oven earlier than listed.  They turned out very well.  And I love how I can now, if I want, personalize these with chocolate etc.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely be making again!

Excellent. My only quibble, which I think other reviewers shared, is that the baking times seemed to be too long, so check on them early during both bakings. For the chocolate, we just melted bittersweet chocolate chips and then dipped them.

Not as rich as my usual recipe but this is fast and easy and quite good. I used this recipe when I couldn't find my regular one.

This recipe is great! I've made biscotti many times before, but this recipe will be my staple! I didn't have pure anise on hand, so I used chinese five spice (mine was anise, cinnamon, cloves, fennel, and szechuan pepper) and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a touch of allspice. It was delicious! Woke up hungry with nothing in the house and this made a great breakfast with some earl grey tea and boiled eggs:) Thanks!

This isn't my all time favorite biscotti recipe, but it is pretty darn good. This is a really simplistic recipe, and a nice one to keep around. I'll keep making these in the morning for my fiance and I to enjoy over coffee.

My in-laws announced they were going to stop by and I flew into the kitchen to whip these up!  Took no time and was super easy!  I did them very plain because of the time constraints and substituted vanilla ext for the anise.  They were such a hit with my MIL that she asked me to back some for my sister in laws bridal shower that weekend!  For those I did the vanilla ext again but added 1 tbsp cinnamon and a bunch of mini choco chips.  I divided the dough into 4 logs to make smaller cookies and everyone at the luncheon RAVED about them!  Definitely a go-to recipe that can be altered so easily to change flavorings!

The first batch I made a few days ago was made with almond extract because my grocery did not have anise.  My husband loved them and has been snacking on them all week.  After locating some anise, I made them exactly as the recipe specifies and again, this is a huge hit.  
As others did, I just rolled it out into one piece and then sliced it lengthwise and then again into smaller pieces to toast.  Two alterations: I did not wait for it to completely cool, and I used a pizza cutter for slicing which made it very easy to make evenly measured slices.

This was very good. I think I would have liked it better if I had added some more fun stuff to it, but as it was I just used it as a basic recipe and used all almond extract and about a cup of roasted almonds. Very good, but not quite the level of flavor I was looking for. I made them without anise because it was a Christmas gift for mom who doesn't like anise, but I am excited to try it with anise and I will probably throw in some anise seed as well. Good texture, basic ingredients and easy directions make this one I will use again. Thanks. Edit: I did try this recipe with the anise extract and about 1 Tbsp of anise seeds. I really enjoyed that one. I also made it with almond extract and toasted rough chopped almonds again. I dipped the bottoms of it in Ghirardeli dark chocolate and let them set. Very good with coffee. I will keep experimenting with flavors but I am glad I found this recipe.

This is a really good biscotti recipe.  Like others, I used 2 tsp. of almond and one tsp. vanilla flavoring since I didn't have anise on hand.  I added chopped craisins and almonds to it and drizzled white chocolate over the finished product.  Yummy and looks great on my Christmas cookie platter!

After all the reviews I was fairly sure these would turn out good - so I was really disappointed as they taste nothing like italian biscotti at all: To crumbly and oily - real italian cantucci (biscotti) are harder, and without the buttery taste. After a bit more research I found out that there is NOT oil or butter in real italian biscotti-recipes, only eggs, and also considerably more sugar.   Apart from this there is nothing _wrong_ with the recipe if you are not after the italian biscotti taste.

I made these to go with Pumpkin Spiced Latte on this site.  Left out anise, and added 1/4t of nutmeg, cloves, cardamom plus 1 t cinnamon. Also added 1/2 cup slivered almond crunched up in the bag and added to the batter.  These are wonderful, and the spice went beautifully with the Pumpkin Latte.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely easy to follow.  The whole family has enjoyed these.  I have also varied the recipe a bit.  Adding different mixes such as chocolate chips, walnuts, cranberries, almonds etc.  usually about 1 cup.  You can also dip in chocolate white, milk or dark depending on taste, as well as change the extract ie: almond or vanilla.  YUM!

I was surprised I enjoy the anise flavor it's perfect with a cup of coffee.  My only tip to those who would like to add other ingredients such as nuts, chocolate chips or dried fruits - I would recommend chopping them up as larger pieces get in the way when you are trying to slice the loaves after the first baking.  Enjoy!!

This is a WONDERFUL basic biscotti recipe. Use it as a base recipe and add what you want. I did do what other reviewers suggested and used vanilla and almond extracts instead anise (which I didn't have in my pantry), and I like the sweet nuttiness it had.

This is it!! This is the traditional biscotti recipe I've been searching for. My Italian family enjoyed my grandfather's biscotti for many years, and sadly I never got the chance to ask him about the recipe before he passed. This has the crisp bite and perfect anise flavoring. Look no further for the perfect biscotti recipe. No need to alter this one :)

This is a great basic biscotti recipe that can easily be modified to meet your taste bud requirements!  I substituted 1 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp of pure hazelnut extract for the anise, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, an egg wash and dipped the bottoms in chocolate.  Awesome!  My husband is hooked!  Thank you for this keeper  :-)

Mmm, delicious (and first time!) biscotti. I added almonds and a bit of vanilla and cut the recipe in half, using 2 eggs and 2 cups of flour. It cracked quite a lot in the oven and I don't know if that's natural, but it turned out with a splendid taste nonetheless. I piped some chocolate on one side just for a finishing touch- I'll definitely be making this again.

I really liked this basic recipe.  I opted for 1 TBSP of vanilla instead of anise, and I threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips, too (about 1/2 c).  With 1 T of your choice extract and 1/2 c of your choice of any mix-in, this recipe could offer endless possibilities!

Love to eat Biscotti, but 1st time making them. I have to say they are the BEST Biscotti I have ever eaten. Fast and easy to prepare, and so much fun to make. I love my Biscotti to have a good anise flavor and it was PERFECT! I followed the recipe just as written and it will be the only Biscotti recipe I will make. They are TERRIFIC as is but it is great to know if I want I can change the flavor of them if desired. A keeper, thanks :o)

These are simple to make and soooo good!  Cut them thinner and they are crisper, cut them thick and they are more cookie texture.  Lend themselves well to any flavor, too.   Thank you for sharing!

I wanted to see what kind of biscotti recipes there are out there and found this many but this one is the same recipe that I have.  I made biscotti for the first time about a month ago, using this recipe and have had to make 4 batches because everyone I have given them to just love them.  It is my mother-in-law's recipe who was Polish but my father-in-law was Italian and she learned to cook and bake his favorites.  This recipe is the all time best because it is not too sweet, is crunchy but not tooth breaking hard.   I'm not too big on strong anise flavor so I used 1/4 tsp. anise extract and 1/2 tsp. vanilla and there is just a nice hint of anise.  I also use 1 cup of walnuts in the dough.  I've given them to friends and family and everyone loves them, especially my grandchildren.

I never thought *I* could make something like biscotti (not being born a baker, or with any baking skill whatsoever), but this was truly an easy recipe and it tasted great.  My family could not believe I made something like this (stunned was the look on their faces).  I can't wait to wrap this up and give it our for Christmas. Great recipe!

I used 1/2 T. vanilla and 1/2 T. almond extract. Also dipped in bittersweet chocolate.

The dough was very uncooperative - next time I will just spoon onto the parchment paper.

My first time making biscotti. Fantastic basic recipe. Firm but moist. I just drizzled chocolate over the top, but next time I'll try some nuts and lemon in the batter. Everyone loved these.

This was my first attempt at making Biscotti and these were perfect! Like another review stated, five stars are just not enough! Not being a huge fan of Anise, I also substitued the Anise with 3/4 tablespoon Almond Extract, 1/4 teaspoon Vanilla and shaped the dough between 2 sheets of wax paper (made it so easy to handle). Oh, and the cutting while hot with a pizza cutter suggestion is right on!

I made this with almond extract, and then whipped up a half batch with the contents three bags of Earl Grey tea rather than anise flavoring.  It tasted like animal crackers, and thanks for a great recipe!

I have tried a ton of biscotti recipes over the years, and this one is a winner for it's simplicity and ease!
I needed a quick recipe to bring as a last-minute gift and this was perfect!  I made a smaller batch and scaled the recipe down accordingly.  I used melted unsalted butter instead of the oil, and omitted a couple of TBSP of flour based on others' remarks.  I also added salt to the recipe (1/2 tsp. for a half-batch), cinnamon, and whole toasted almonds.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and varying the spices and "additions" (fruits, nuts, chocolate, etc).  Thanks to the original poster, and to all the others who have added their suggestions + remarks!

Really good!  I made a batch with toasted almonds, almond extract and 1/4 cup baking cocoa.  Delicious and they looked good paired with the regular anise ones.

Great basic Biscotti recipe. You can do so much to customize it, add nuts, use almond extract, etc. Do not let it cool too much before trying to slice the cookies. They will crumble if they are too cool.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did not have the anise so I substituted with 2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of almond extract.  I also used half real sugar and half splenda, and no one even noticed. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a lovely basic anise biscotti recipe.  The flavor is not too strong, and the texture is spot on.

They really are good and easy to make.  You have to watch carefully, though, they almost burned after only 18 minutes.

This is the easiest biscotti recipe ever. Being a biscotti junkie, I tried so many recipe . And I like to dip one side of the cookie with melted semi sweet chocolate  .

I too had never made biscotti until I stumbled upon this EASY recipe.  I made it to take to family at Christmas time and even my 18 yo brother loved it!  He even asked me to make him a special batch before he headed back to college!  My favorite combo to date is using vanilla extract & Craisins with the finished biscotti drizzled with a powdered sugar glaze.  Try the orange flavored Craisins - tastes very light & refreshing!  LOVE these!

I just made this last night - i modified it by using vanilla instead of the anise, and i added about a handfull of almonds and hazelnuts.  I also used whole wheat flour and dipped the one side of the biscotti in dark chocolate and it was FANTASTIC.  I cannot rave enough about this recipe.  Follow the proportions to a tee and add your own love to it and your biscotti will be DIVINE.  and SO simple (just as great cooking should be...)

I add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract instead of the anise.  I also add sliced blanched almonds.. delicious!  I always get asked for this recipe whenever I make it for other people. Next time I think I will dip some in chocolate.

i made these gingerbread by adding ginger, molasses, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  It needed a little extra flour, but i was expecting that. My first attempt at biscotti, and everyone raved!

Wonderful base recipe! I used almond flavoring, ground pecans, some wheat flour, and the zest of one lemon. Took them to a friend's for moring coffee and she said it was the best biscotti she has ever had. Her words were "way better than the coffee shops". I like using the oil. They didn't even need to be dipped in chocolate. Great all by themselves. Everyone loved the texture. I'm actually getting ready to make more today. Thanks!

After much trial and error with other recipes, this one is my favorite.  It is crunchy but not rock-hard.  The recipe yields a good basic biscotti.  I have tried many different fruit and flavoring combinations.  My favorite combination is vanilla extract, ginger, ground cloves and cinnamon.

My husband said, "wow! tastes just like biscotti!" I used almond extract instead of anise because that is what I had on hand. Next time I will try anise and maybe add some almonds or dip it in chocolate. I had to use more flour than the recipe called for - it was very sticky dough. Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe! 
It's my first time of making biscotti, and it turned out great. Yap! I did use 1/2-cup of melted butter instead of veg oil as one reviewer suggested, and i used almond extract and brown sugar instead of what recipe calls for. I think I will try some different extracts, grinded nuts, or some orange zest.
The dough was a little too moist to handle, and i had a little problem of transfering the rolls from my working board onto the baking sheet. But, it won’t stop me from making it again and again!
Thank you for sharing!   :-)

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I am a pastry chef in training so to speak! and out of all the recipes that I have tried for biscottis this is one of the best ones for adding other ingredients! One of my favorite versions is so simple that you just add a bit of lemon zest and some Almond extract and then some crushed thin sliced almonds! The best. Thank you very much

After reading the great reviews, I had high hopes for this biscotti recipe, but turns out that I was very disappointed.  The biscotti were dry and very bland.  It seems that with using cooking oil instead of butter, an addition of a little salt might be needed.  Even the toasted almonds that I added weren't enough to give these any zip.  Additionally, the cookies were heavy and doughy even when lightly toasted.  I had intended to use these for a gift, but unfortunately will now have to make a different batch.  Back to my old recipe...

This is an excellent recipe.  It was so easy to make too.  I added walnuts and it was delicious!

I used a dark cookie sheet and the bottom burned a little, so I would use a lower temperture the next time.

What a great recipe!  This was the first time I've ever made biscotti and they came out perfect!  I didn't have any anise/anise extract on hand so I used 1 tsp vanilla extract instead and I added 1/2 cup toasted flaked almonds to the dough as well - sublime! They are already almost gone!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. Very easy to make. I substituted vanilla extract and added some cinnamon to it, to give it some flavor. This is a good recipe to experiment with different flavors. I will make this again!

Very very good! My first biscotti attempt and it is better than any I have ever tasted. I can't keep my hands off them. I used vanilla extract and greased my hands before shaping the dough. Worked very well. Try the recipe! you won't regret it.

This is a great recipe. I made a batch for my daughters school bake sale so I replaced the Almond extract with pure vanilla. The flavor was delightful. I will continue to use this recipe as a base for many other variations. You can definitely play around with extracts and add in nuts, chocolate chips, or dried fruits. I lined my sheets with parchment and wet my hands to spread out the dough.. Simple. Garnished mine with a chocolate drizzle. Looking forward to trying differ flavor combinations.

Absolutely delicious. I read a lot of reviews before making the biscotti. I  made two different batches. One with the anise extract with nuts and white chocolate morsels and second batch with vanilla extract,  almond extract, chopped almonds and white chocolate morsels. Both delicious but my favorite was the biscotti using the anise extract. Next time I will increase the extract amount for even more flavor. I agree with some of the reviewers  to bring the  cooking time down to 18 minutes and then 6 minutes on each side.  But this also depends on your oven and if you prefer the biscottI hard or a bit soft.  I found the flavor of the cookies seem to intensity more so after a day. These are really really good. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

It was my first time making biscotti and I LOVED IT. This recipe is simple, easy to follow and is a perfect "base" for any other nuts or dried fruit you might want to add to the dough.

As I don't have anise extract or oil, I substituted that with 1/2 tbsp vanilla bean paste, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 coriander (after reading some of the suggestions in the reviews).  The result was a light, crunchy, yet not hard biscotti that was more-ish, you just keep wanting to take one more piece! As good as store bought biscotti, will definitely make again!

I was looking for something fast and easy for the kids to take to school and found this recipe so I made it. It was hard to mix the dough at first but I got the hang of it after a few minutes. The taste- it was just ok. It is definitely missing something. My son said it's too flour-ry and I kinda agree. He didn't take any to school sadly. My 5 year old on the other hand ate it. I dipped half of it with semi sweet chocolate and left the rest plain so I can dunk them in my coffee. Overall, it was just OK. I will stick to Thea's  Biscotti Toscani recipe. It's more work but tastier.

I baked Biscotti today.  They are wonderful!  I had no problem with the consistency of dough. Secret is in the measuring. I used vanilla and almond extract, sliced almonds and orange zest. Very delicious!  Nice and crunchy. Rather addictive as well. This may become my Go To for gifts. Such a lovely morsel with tea or coffee or any time. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe for all types of bakers! I'm not a good baker so this recipe was very easy for me. Don't be surprised with the stickiness like I was, that's normal! Also, don't add any more flour than the recipe says, the cookie will come out great as is!

This recipe is very nice. I substituted almond extract for anise extract and added a half of a cup of chocolate chips with a chocolate drizzle over the finished product and there was a round of yums from the dinner table after I served them. 
I did not cook them quite as long (about 20 minutes) and I did add a splash of milk to the dough to make it a little more moist but the base recipe is a keeper for sure. :D

Use almond instead as an alternative. Reduction baking time some. Add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves

This turned out amazing, even with the following substitutions:

1/2 cup of the sugar was brown, not white
Vanilla extract instead of anise
Used baking soda and cream of tartar instead of baking powder
Olive oil
Stirred in the remainder of a bag of heath bits from previous baking

Hubby and I both loved these.  Next time I may add some cinnamon!

I used vanilla instead of anise extract and they were delicious vanilla biscottis.... When you roll the dough out it helps if your hands are just slightly wet....then the dough won't stick to your hands and make such a mess. It was a perfect recipe! Loved it.

Summer just recently started, so I became completely bored! I stumbled across this recipe, and decided to try it. The results were AMAZING! I used vanilla extract, which worked fine. Since my brother has food allergies, we substituted the eggs with 'egg substitute'. When adding the cups of flour, it became quite tedious, but I managed to finish mixing. We had a bit of a mess to clean up at the end, but it still was worth it. The biscotti wasn't exactly crunchy, but it still worked! Do not undercook the first time, because that will ruin the final product like we did; we only cooked it for 18 mn

Yum! I followed the recipe completely except I used wheat flour instead of white, and used 10 drops of lemon oil and 1/2 c of unsweetened coconut - two of my Mom's favorite flavors - in place of the anise. She also likes crunchy things, so I sprinkled the top with coarse sugar before the first baking! :) It made three dozen. It was a fantastic recipe that I look forward to make again!

So easy and makes a perfect biscotti. Made a few adjustments; used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, used almond extract instead of anise, added slivered almonds and white chocolate chips. Cut while they're hot. Turned out PERFECTLY.

So quick and simple to make with few ingredients, yet the result is delicious! My first attempt ever at making biscotti, so I chose this recipe for the short ingredient list. The results were so good I don't need to try any other recipes. Perfect, flavourful, crispy and golden biscotti. Even better than those served in the posh coffee shops. Thank you for posting this, Jandee.

The BEST!! I use this recipe faithfully since I found it in 2008. Over the years I use anise oil and because we love the flavor, increased it to 1/2 tsp. This may not appeal to all.

This recipe is wonderfully easy to make. I made it as is, then made it with chopped hazelnuts.  Also tried it with dark bittersweet chocolate melted and drizzled over it ti give a wonderful finished look.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made these the other day and exchanged the anise extract for half vanilla half almond extract and they worked out great. However, I would reccomend keeping a close eye on them or dropping the heat from 375 to 350, as mine did burn a bit on the bottom. I'm going to try this with orange zest and dried cranberries on a vanilla extract base, and another batch with banana extract, chocolate chips then dipped half in chocolate. Hope they work! The original batch was great!

I am at about 9000 feet above sea level.  I added 1 egg and 1/2 c. flour.  I had to add sprinkles of water before I could get the dough to come together.  It is important to NOT overwork the dough when making these.  The flavor was very good.  Keep in mind that the picture shows biscotti with almonds and to get that you have to add almonds.  When adding almonds toast in a pan over medium heat moving constantly for about 3 minutes then unpan.  This will really bring out the almond oils and flavor.
I WILL DO THIS RECIPE AGAIN.

This is the first time I'm making biscotti and I love it! My mum loves this as she dips it in coffee! I used a 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla extract and a 1/2 tablespoon of almond extract in replace of the anise oil. The flavor turned out great! The dough is really really sticky, I add a little flour to work with it, and it was pretty easy! Try and handle the dough with moist hands, it helps too. This is such an easy and quick recipe! I always have these ingredients on hand. Great recipe! Would love to make them again and again!

Excellent "foolproof" recipe. Lends itself to be tweaked with whatever nuts, fruit, or flavoring of your preference. Can sub. half oil/butter with apple sauce to cut calories. Thanks !!

I make a batch every other week for my parents as they love it.  I use almonds, walnuts or pecans to vary the taste.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  People always think I slaved over my biscotti, but with this recipe I can't believe how easy they are to make.  BTW, I usually use 1 1/2 tsps. vanilla extract and 1 1/2 tsps. of almond extract instead of all almond extract, which I find far too strong a flavor.

I love this recipe. These were the first biscotti's I've ever made and I can't wait to make MORE! The anise extract is very strong. It smells like licorice/mint almost and the smell of it will fill up your whole kitchen! In the future I would use vanilla extract and anise extract, I figured that I'd customize the extract portion of this recipe because the anise extract was very strong. Overall, they were also very simple to make in my opinion.

My first try with biscotti and I will make it again! Great basic recipe that is easy to tweak. I never knew biscotti was so easy, and the tweaking possibilities are endless! (I dipped one side of mine in dark chocolate then sliced almonds). Can be packed for an excellent gift. Mama mia!

Mixes well, had to use more flour at a higher altitude.  Used disarrono instead of anise for flavouring.  Need to add some almond extract as well as the flavor was a bit weak.

Yum.  Substituted white whole wheat flour.  I didn't have anise extract or oil, so I used vanilla instead.  Next time I'll add a little almond extract too.  I chopped up semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts and stirred them right into the heavy dough (took a little elbow grease).  (BTW: No extra flour required!)

Used wax paper and a rolling pin to form two equal logs, which I then dumped onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Practically no clean up!  Baked about 24 minutes, waited a couple minutes, sliced with a pizza cutter, and toasted another 6-8 minutes.  Next time I'll slice with a pizza cutter just after they come out of the oven (or maybe a minute later).  

These are delicious, with a crumbly texture and the perfect bite -- not jaw breakingly crunchy.  I will definitely make these again.

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

This is our go-to biscotti recipe. We make a different flavor combination every Sunday. We've exchanged the anise extract for orange extract and added dried cranberries. We've also exchanged anise for almond and added nuts. Never disappoints

Yikes - no sticky dough complaints over here! Very tasty, but crumbly. I used a combo of all-purpose and wheat flour (although - just 3/4 cup of whole wheat) and also added 1 cup of almonds. I'm guessing these two changes may have accounted for the dry and crumbly dough - a challenge to work with for sure. Next time, I will make exactly as written and see if they come out differently.

I tried this recipe the day I first saw it..It was easy and very tasty. As I sliced this I chose not to rebake it the second time. Was just like a cookie texture tender. Everyone that had them LOVED them. Gave the recipe away numerous times!!AAAAA Great and easy recipe...Thanks..Irene Marie....

For never having made biscotti, I'm blown away. I've made 3 batches this weekend - my last with orange zest, maple flavoring, dried cranberries and slivered almonds on top. Wow. The possibilities are endless and it is fabulous!!

Mine turned out great! I don't like the taste of anise, so I used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract. What I enjoyed most about this recipe is that the dough is stiff enough where you don't need to refrigerate it before baking it. I'm impatient, so this works out well for me. I also like that this recipe is a good base, so you can customize your biscotti by adding in whatever you want. I'm keeping this recipe. My husband, who I make the biscotti for likes it and that is all that matters!

Absolutely great biscotti, I make them often. Simple and easy, but not plain. If you like a more crunchy texture, substitute the 1/4 cup of flour with coarse cornmeal. I have already written a review, and can not praise this recipe enough.

I had a urge to make biscotti, came across this recipe and just finished baking them. What a quick, easy and delicious recipe! I'm into whole grain baking, so I couldn't resist subbing white whole wheat flour for the AP and, as one reviewer suggested, 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar. I didn't have anise extract, so ground anise seeds for the dough and to sprinkle on top of the logs along with sugar sprinkles. The pizza cutter idea worked great also! This will be my go-to base for many biscotti variations.

This recipe is great.  I did sub orange extrac for the anis and added dried cranberries, white chocolate and milk chocolate chips too.  I used my mix master and there was no problem with the dough being too sticky to work.  This is a keeper, thank you.

My mother loves them.  I did't have anise extract and I subbed it for half vanilla and half almond extract.  I tossed in some chopped almonds too.  Keep an eye on them in the oven, mine started to burn on the bottom, so I flipped them half way.

Great flavor!!  My biscotti didn't rise in the oven (?) so they ended up being flatish.  I think I over did the water on my fingers, which added extra liquid!!  Anyway, they were still very good cut into squares and eaten like a cookie.  Improvise!!

These were pretty good. I haven't had much biscotti before this & thought it was good but not great, maybe it was just me! I made it exactly as written except used vanilla extract because its what I had. Once they were done I dipped them in a little melted chocolate. My 19 month old loved them! Good snack to take to the store while shopping & keeps my son in the cart while munching away!!

Good cookies, but I think next time I will try them with vanilla instead of anise.  I was not familiar with anise, if I had to describe it, I'd say it's kind of got a licorice aftertaste to it, which I'm not sure if I like.  This recipe was simple, with a good pay off, nice consistency in the cookies, and a great toast that holds up well in coffee.

This was my first time making biscotti and it came out perfectly. My family has a nut allergy so I used craisns. Then I made a second batch and replaced 1/4 cup flour with coconut flour and put in some cocoa for colour. Great and easy receipe!

Good basic biscotti recipe. I didn't have any problems with it. I added slivered almonds to half of my batch and cherries to the other half. They came out great.

One of the most easy Biscotti recipes I have used. I did substitute 1/4 cup softened butter for the vegetable oil, and it worked find. GOOD Biscotti.

This is a great and easy recipe. Yo can change the flavor simply by using any extract in place of the anise, and it always turns out yummy.

Very good recipe, not as hard and crunchy as most biscotti I've had, which is a plus for me.  Subbed vanilla for the anise like some other reviewers, tastes great!  Only downfall- this recipe will NOT make 42 cookies as it states, I think they meant to write 24, unless you like micro- cookies.

I don't care for the taste of anise, so I substituted 1 tsp almond extract. I'm also going to try using vanilla on the next batch I make.

Great, easy recipe with impressive results!  I always vary the ingredients/flavorings when I make these cookies and they always turn out perfectly.  Additionally, I drizzle them with white and milk chocolate.

This is a perfect base recipe for biscotti.  You can change out the anise for vanilla extract, almond extract or a combination of the two.  I also like to add chopped almonds or mini chocolate chips.  The measurements, for me, were right on.

This was the first time I've tried to make Biscotti.  After mixing all of the ingredients, following the recipe exactly, I knew there was no way this sticky mass could be formed into a roll.  I resolved this by turning half of the recipe at a time onto a lightly floured cutting board. Then by making sure I had my hands lightly floured too I was able to carefully handle it. Was very disappointed that this wasn't mentioned in the recipe. Would have saved me some panic. The flavor of these turned out great, but I think I'll find another recipe before settling on one.

I've made these a couple of times now, and we love them. It's a very versatile recipe. I have used almond extract and/or vanilla extract instead of the anise. I have also added nuts and chocolate. Have fun and be creative!

This is a great basic recipe. I just made it last night for the first time and had no problems. That new non-stick Reynolds works great for biscotti baking. For coffee dunking, I spread white chocolate and sliced almonds on top of half the batch. Used almonds and cinnamon on the other half for tea. Thanks for posting the recipe, Jandee!

what a great and easy biscotti. the dough was a bit too sticky for me right after mixing, so I put it in the fridge for about 1hr before going back to it. that 1hr in the fridge ready made the difference. the dough was firmer and not sticky anymore. 

This recipe holds up really well as a base fur other flavors. instead I added .5 C ground almond, 2tsp of vanilla,1 tsp of almond extract, zest of a lemon, juice of half the lemon and 1.5tsp dried culinary grade lavender.  I was debating making a lavender earl grey drizzle for them, but they're already half gone!

Very bland and tasteless.  The recipe as printed with 3 1/4 cups flour,  3 eggs, and 1/2cup oil is VERY dry.   Too much flour, not enough sugar.  Not sure where all the great reviews are coming  from.

Other than substituting almond extract for the anise extract, I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the outcome. Using a pizza wheel to cut the individual cookies worked beautifully with almost no crumbling. Since I didn't add any nuts or cranberries, I drizzled the cookies with a bit of melted dark chocolate as shown in the video. I will definitely make this again.

I am not an anise fan, so used a combo of vanilla and almond, and added some mini chocolate chips to the dough, which was harder than expected to incorporate. Came out tasty, but was on the crumbly side when slicing. For the last few I used a knife that was longer than the loaf, made it much easier & the ends stayed on. Wish I had thought of that instead of using a pizza cutter like another reviewer suggested. Overall, very good & can't wait to make again!

I cannot figure out how so many reviews can vary so much for this recipe.  Some reviews say too moist, some too dry. The only thing I changed was using almond extract instead of anise. These were extremely dry, fell apart and were bland. I am a seasoned cook/baker and this was very discouraging to have this recipe be such a flop. I won't make this recipe again for sure.

I've used this recipe lots of times, and love it.  The base recipe is delicious, and it's super easy to play with.
Something I've really enjoyed doing is using equal amounts vanilla and anise extracts, and then rolling the dough in cinnamon sugar before the first bake (snickerdoodle biscotti!)

I have been using this recipe for more years than I can remember and it is wonderful.  I just realized that I've never left a review - shame on me!  This  biscotti is very simple to make, delicious, and versatile.  I often drizzle it with melted white or dark chocolate; sometimes, I dunk one side in melted chocolate and cover in sprinkles or crushed candy.  I often give it as a gift at Christmas and on birthdays.  It also freezes well!  It's perfection!

I made these and enjoyed them very much.  I do, however, have some words of advice concerning the recipe.  First, for those who find the anise flavor too mild, I think the better option is to use anise oil instead of extract.  I believe for those of us who remember the delicious anise flavored goodies that our grandmothers made, the secret lies in the fact that they probably used anise oil.  Second, whatever you do, DO NOT add extra flour to make the dough less sticky.  That will totally destroy the lovely sandy texture of this cookie.  Letting the dough rest a bit (10 to 15 min.) helps lessen the  stickiness.  You can also wet your hands slightly or moisten them with a few drops of vegetable oil before forming your rolls.  Third, as this is such a wet dough I don't recommend using parchment paper to line your baking sheets.  I always use parchment and almost had disastrous results when I did so with this recipe.

5 stars for this recipe.  I followed directions exactly and am very happy with the result.  The dough was easy to work with and the baked cookie has just the right amount of crispy and chewy texture.  I did not have anise flavoring so I took another reader's suggestion and subbed 1/4 tsp each of ground cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg and cloves.  Love the subtle flavor.  Will definitely keep this as my go-to recipe for biscotti and am looking forward to trying anise and other flavorings and additions.

Heeded prior warnings and set each half of dough on cookie sheet-sized parchment paper. Molded and double paper over to roll into perfect shape. Then put paper on cookie sheet and baked as directed. Only change I made was adding a cup of chopped almonds. Otherwise, followed the instructions completely.  30 minutes to bake and 10 minutes per side. Superb recipe!

I used almond extract instead of anise, and substituted coconut oil to vegetable oil, for the health factor.
My whole family loves this recipe!

Delish!! super easy and fun to press dough out. Wonderful flavor and texture. I used less than the full tablespoon of anise for a milder taste.

This recipe is a keeper! The only thing I did different was instead of 1 tbsp anise I used 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tbsp almond extract. This biscotti came out perfect, my family couldn't get enough of them!

I love this recipe. It is quick and easy, crunchy yet not hard! I sometimes bake it as is or sometimes mix in chocolate chips into the dough to sooth my family's sweet-tooth cravings.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  I made alot of other ones on this site that were better.  It seems like to much flour for 1/2 cup of oil....they were crumbly and dry.   Sorry but thank you anyway for submitting the recipe. I tried this again with only 3  cups flour and they came out much better. Use less flour ....

I made these last night and they were *absolutely* delicious! I did make a couple of changes, I used Butter instead of Vegetable oil because I prefer the flavor, and I used Almond Extract instead of Anise and then added a cup of almonds to the dough. This was so easy to make that I didn't even have to use a mixer and they came out absolutely perfect! I will definitely be making these for Christmas cookies this year. Next time I might add some Orange zest to it as well.  Delicious, moist, crunchy and crumbly all at the same time. Exactly what a good Biscotti should be!

I just made these today, and they are the easiest biscotti I've ever made.  Dough is great to work with (just need to roll in a little flour).  I added ground almonds and a pinch of vanilla - you can eat the dough raw, that's how good it is.  Janet G.

I substituted 1 Tbsp of orange extract and added 1 Tbsp of orange rind and these were so good. Will definitely make again. My teething baby liked to chew on them too.

I used more anise and put in the grated peel of one lemon and one orange. I also turned the temp down to 350 for the first bake and then to 325 for the second bake. When they were done and cooled  I dipped them on one side with a mixture of melted chocolate and 1 tsp of crisco shortening. They take a little long to dry but they are worth the wait.

Nice and simple biscotti. I added finely chopped pecans and because I didn't have anise oil or extract, I added vanilla. I made myself some chocolate dipping with cocoa powder, and it turned out very nice. It didn't crumble as much while slicing, so I am very happy with the result! I will try different flavours using this recipe from now on!

Very nice and easy recipe. I like that it uses vegetable oil. I find it easier to make the dough with only 3 cups of flour. I add slivered almonds to this recipe and then have made other variations. Orange cranberry is a good. I line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper and form one long rectangle so I only have two ends. Overall a real keeper and very flexible. Thanks!

Love it!  I'm not much of a baker but this was so easy I had to try it.  Instead of anise extract I used almond extract and some sliced almonds.  It was so good the next time I made orange with orange zest and a glaze on top.   So much better than Starrbucks!

Ok.  So I've now made this recipe several times - so much I've memorized it.  I've compared it to other recipes & this is now my go to basic biscotti recipe.  Variations: toasted almonds with almond extract.  Vanilla extract with mini chocolate chips.

Five stars!  I have been making biscotti for a long time.  This is the best ever.  I like the softer texture.  No teeth breaker as another reviewer stated.  I used almond extract and added dried cherries (from King Arthur).  Didn't have anise on hand.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times over the course of many years.  It is truly outstanding.  I also put in 1/2 cup of nuts (almonds, walnuts, etc) and 1/2 cup of dried fruit (cranberries, marachine cherries, raiins, etc).  10/10!!!  I do not use the anise, but substitute for pure vanilla (1.5 tsp).  Thank you!

Thank you Jandee---Excellent biscotti recipe!  
I didn't have the anise, so had to sub with a bit of vanilla, and a tbsp. of almond extract.  I will most definitely go shopping for the anise and make these again.

This is my first at biscotti baking. Recipe was easy and quick. I will be making more. My question is: how do I keep the end from crumbling when I slice them? Any input is greatly appreciated.

This is a great recipe.  It is easy and pretty quick.  I use almond extract instead of anise.  Same proportions.  I got a biscotti gift box from my boss this year and I was inspired to try and make them myself.  They came from Gina's Homemade (www.ginashomemade.com/gifts).  Mine were actually pretty good but I would need to play with the recipe for a while to make the chocolate biscotti that I got in the gift box.  I want to try this next week for my family.  Any idea what is a great chocolate to use?

This is definitely the best and most simple biscotti recipe. I added sliced almonds and little bit of almond extract to mine. They turned out beautifully! Other biscotti recipes often call for many more egss, and I have attempted to make them and they taste mostly like egg--very disgusting.

Very easy recipe. Made it for the first time and it came out great. Only change is to turn the temperature down a bit when cooking the sliced biscotti. A few were burned. I made yet another batch and added toasted chopped almonds and it came out wonderful.

The dough was so sticky and such a pain, but totally worth it!  These were even better the next day.  Tasted just as good as the store bought ones.  I'm eating one right now : )

I have tried a few biscotti recipes from this site, this was by far my favorite! The only thing different I did was I substituted the oil with a half a cup of melted butter because I was out of vegetable oil. These are fantastic! Crunchy, perfect flavor! Will definitley be making these again.

Fantastic!  I didn't have anise so I added 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamon.  I also added one packet vanilla sugar.  Turned out great!

A great recipe! Made a batch of it this morning and half of it is already gone. For a little more flavour, I added a tbsp of fennel seeds and a tbsp of cardamom powder, its gives it a great aroma and the house smells great as well. A 5 Star recipe! Thanks

this recipe is very good. I made biscotti for the first time ever using this recipe. I omitted the anise oil because I didn't have any. I added vanilla grated orange into it and put slivered almonds on top before baking... turned out fantastic... gave it as a gift to a woman that is opening up a tearoom... thankyou

Perfect base recipe! Although the recipe is great the way it is, you can really add any additional ingredients to it.  I substituted the almond for vanilla extract.  Another good combo is dried cherry and pistachios! Yummmm

Excellent and easy recipe.  I was surpised how easy it was to make coffee shop quality biscotti.  I followed the others' advice, substituted vanilla and almond extract for the anise, and cut it with a pizza cutter while still hot on the sheet.  I will be making this LOTS more, especially to ship as birthday gifts to friends out of state.

This was pretty good with chocolate drizzle.  I also didn't use anise as I don't care for it, instead used vanilla and almond like other reviewers.

Mine did not turn out the way I wanted it to, I think the oven was on too high because they were slightly burnt at the bottom although they taste great. I added a few drops of orange blossom water and then dipped in melted chocolate to hide the defaults i caused.

SO EASY! I've never baked anything from scratch in my life! I decided to try this recipe in honor of my mom, who whipped up biscotti for family/friends all the time! She made it look so simple, but I didn't inherit her love and talent for baking. This recipe was no harder than making brownies from a box! I used sambuca instead of anise, and a tiny drop of vanilla extract. I sprinkled confectioners sugar on top and they are YUMMY! Next time, I may add some nuts or chocolate chips. The recipe is very plain which lends to the versatility of being able to add in other ingredients.   THANKS FOR SHARING JANDEE!

Overall this recipe is pretty good but to me it isn't true biscotti. I wanted to give it a try as the reviews are awesome but found I had to modify it quite a bit. I think the oil makes it easier to cut but using butter gives it better flavor, I also found that I had to add quite a bit of flour to be able to get a good working consitency as it was originally too runny... maybe just use egg yolk next time as in other biscotti recipes? I originally tried to refrigerate the dough but that did not help. I also didn't use anise but instead used rum extract and added cranberries and lemon zest despite this though it still turned out  a bit bland and I think I will have to put a zesty lemon icing over top to give it some more flavor. I might try this again but to me it needs some work. Very simple recipe however, a good start if you are just learning to make biscotti.

nice flavor, easy to make. Especially nice as we are allergic to milk. BUT... I found it difficult to slice - very fragile - and the top "split". Still delicious anyway!

I never realized biscotti was so easy to make! I made the first batch true to recipe, then for the second batch I used ground cardamom and lemon extract 1 tsp each in place of the anise. Wow! Thanks for this recipe!

I made this yesterday. My 2nd attempt at making Biscotti. The first recipe I tried I didn't like. It didn't get hard enough like a biscotti should. BUT this recipe turned out great. Crisp and crunchy. I divided the dough and made one with almond extract and craisins and another with vanilla extract and cocoa and walnuts. I will be trying other flavors soon. It won't be long and I will have eaten them all up! Easy and tasty.

I've been using this recipe for more than a year now and it's by far the best biscotti recipe I've ever tried - so simple and so delicious. I use almond extract instead of anise and sometimes add chopped almonds. It's so versatile - I've made lemon versions by adding lemon zest and using lemon and vanilla extracts, and chocolate chip versions with mini semisweet chips, chopped walnuts and vanilla extract. I always turn the oven temperature down to 300 degrees to toast them and only bake for 5-6 minutes on each side (I like my biscotti a little on the softer side).  Thanks for the great recipe!

These turned out great! I did use almond extract in place of the anise and added in some crushed almonds. For an almond lover these changes made the taste amazing! I also made sure to have wet hands while forming the dough as suggested by reviews. I definitely will be making these again very soon!

I love biscotti, but am too frugal to buy it so I went searching for a recipe. This is the first I tried and I love it! So simple. Definitely keep your hands oiled when handling the dough. I also substituted vanilla for the anise. Next time I'll try a different flavor, vanilla was all I had on had at the time. Thanks Jandee!

Although the dough is sticky, it can be easily managed if you wet your hands.  I have also tried this method:  Plop the dough along the length of the cookie sheet and sprinkle sugar over the surface.  It is easy to form a somewhat uniform log this way.  I wouldn't add more flour as I think this would make a dry cookie.

Good recipe. Cookies were a wee bit soft, which in most cases would be great, but I like my biscotti rock hard. Not sure if it was something I did wrong but, either way they were good. Not amazing though.

For years I've always made a different biscotti recipe on this site that used butter instead of oil.  Well, time for change.  THIS is now my favorite.  Yes, the dough is sticky when trying to form, but wet your hands and it will work like a charm.  Easy to change up the additions - cranberry walnut one batch, almond chocolate chip the second batch today. And of course, drizzled with melted chocolate.  Used grapeseed oil instead of veg oil, but none the wiser.

Excellent. I used artificial vanilla essence because that's all I have, but SO DELICIOUS OH MY GOODNESS! And so easy too! Now I see the overpriced at fancy coffee stores and laugh so hard on the inside.

The biscotti is good for a basic biscotti and can be improved by adding sliced almonds....I would recommend being very generous with the the flour when you are rolling the biscotti into the rolls. Also if you want longer biscotti make your rolls wider.

Excellent! Everyone loved it! I liked how these were hard, but not rock solid like some store-bought biscotti are. Great with hot chocolate or maple tea.  I used 1/2tbsp of almond extract and 1/2 tbsp of vanilla extract because I couldn't find anise extract at the store. I also added chopped pecans, and melted chocolate chips to drizzle over it once I finished baking.

Precisely what it claims to be -- quick, easy, basic biscotti. It will be easy to modify with chocolate, almonds, cranberry and lemon, etc. Followed someone's suggestion of wetting hands to work with dough -- perfect. A definite keeper.

I made this and gave it out for Christmas and it was a big hit! People couldnt believe how easy it was to make and how great they tasted.  I totally recommend this recipe to anyone who does'nt want anything too complicated or with too many ingredients. I did add shaved almonds to the batter and it didnt change the consistancy or the perfect crisp of the cookies. So glad i found this awesome recipe.

Do not bake as long as stated on the first time, it burns very quickly. Otherwise very good. I made it with almond extract and 1/2 cup sliced almonds.

Loved this basic recipe!  Here's how I modified it to make different flavors (I took the anise out of all of them):  Peppermint Biscotti - add 1 tsp. peppermint extract and 1 cup crushed candy canes - drizzle dark chocolate on top of cooled cookies and then sprinkle on some crushed candy canes  Toffee Biscotti - add 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 cup crushed Heath bars - drizzle milk chocolate on top of cooled cookies and then sprinkle on some Heath toffee bits.  Cranberry Orange Biscotti - add 1 Tbsp. orange zest, 3 Tbsp. orange juice (and you will need a little more flour), and 1 cup chopped Craisins - drizzle white chocolate on cooled cookies.

DUDE, THESE ARE AMAZING!! My first biscotti I've ever made where chocolate cranberries ones that were ultimate failures, but after trying this recipe, I've overcome my fear of making biscotti! It's such a simple yet delicious biscotti that in no way lacks flavoring. The only change I really made was using vanilla rather than anise for personal preference. The timing is around what the recipe states, but I usually take the biscotti out when it's slightly soft enough to cut, and then I leave it in the oven for the second baking time until it is lightly browned around the edges and hard. That's how I usually determine the baking time for this recipe, and it always comes out perfect and good enough to eat all day. :D

I used 2 tsp of almond extract and 1 tsp of vanilla. I added in 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries into the batter. When cooled I drizzled with melted white chocolate. They were delcious and would make a great gift. Great base recipe to try all different flavor combos!

Made this recipe 2x.  The first time not wonderful as I had over cooked them on the 2nd cooking.   For the initial baking I only needed 20 mins; when I put them in again, it should have been for 6 mins a side.   I made the recipe again the next night and watched them more closely.  they turned out great!  I separated the dough and put dark chocolate chunks in half.  Cranberries and almonds in the other half --- very yum and easy! I gave these as gifts to the extra teachers.  3 biscotti in a holiday bag... they looked really nice.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use butter because of a dairy allergy.  This was perfect.  I didn't have the anise extract or oil but I happened to have 3 bottles of aniseed.  I used a coffee grinder to grind them a bit and substituted the extract with 2 tablespoon of the ground seeds.  The biscotti turned out perfectly.  Great flavor, perfect crispness.  I baked them on stoneware and will absolutely be making these again.  Thank you for the recipe!

I was never a big fan of biscotti but decided to try making some.  I did replace the anise with an equal amount of imitation almond flavor.  Wow, these are great!  I read someone else's review who rated it poorly because the recipe fell apart when using whole wheat flour.  I tried whole wheat flour also with bad results.  I would not rate the recipe lower for that though; the author of the recipe says to use flour not wheat flour.  And wheat flour DOES act diifferently that white flour; it does not hold together because it doesn't have as much gluten as white flour.  I am going to use some of the suggested add-ins and make these for Christmas presents.  This recipe makes a wonderful biscotti that gives this non-morning person something to look forward to in the morning!

This is now a staple in my cookbook!  I substitute almond extract for the anise and I add chopped roasted almonds.  I also dip the bottom of the cookie (that way you get chocolate all the way thru ) and then chopped almonds.  This recipe also works well when doubled...heck I am even gonna triple it with the holidays coming up.

I LOVE this biscotti recipe!!! It has the perfect amount of crispness and the variation possibilities are endless! People rave about this when I make it. I make it exactly as the recipe states except I use vanilla extract instead of the anise. One reviewer suggested wetting your fingers to avoid the stickiness while forming the loaves and I've found that that works great. I have two favorite variatations: slivered almonds (chocolate dipped or not, either way is great), and candied cherry and walnut. I package these and give them as gifts during the holidays. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This is the best recipe, my search for the "perfect biscotti recipe" is over. This works great with any glaze, extract, syrup, or flavoring you can find.

I screwed mine up. I over-baked the first time, so couldn't do the second step. I really liked the texture (like a big "Pecan Sandie"). If you don't have jumbo eggs, I'd suggest 1/4 cup less flour. I had to spray w/oil to dampen all the flour. Will try again when I get an oven timer, ha ha. I will try almond extract next time. I like licorice and anisette liquor, but not too crazy about the anise flavor in this. I put sliced almonds in this (had them in the pantry) and was a great crunch. I'm going almond all the way next time.

WOW! ... I was looking for some cookies to make that don't require butter (since I'm out), and came upon this recipe. I was really skeptical but I love biscotti and decided to give it a try. It was so easy and they taste amazing! I can't believe I successfully made biscotti! These would make great gifts around the holidays dressed up with sliced almonds and drizzled with chocolate.  I didn't have anise oil so used vanilla extract instead --- also, a tip for anyone who worries that their rolls are not smooth - don't worry. Mine were very "spiky" looking when I put them in the oven - It doesn't matter in the end!  Thanks for a great recipe. It's totally a keeper!

I made these for coffee hour at church and got rave reviews.  This was my first time making biscotti and found them easy to make. The dough was easy to work with, I didn't have anise so I used almond extract. I will will be making these again.

Amazing biscotti gets 6 stars for flavor and one deducted for being a tad crumbly when slicing. Also, I used 1/2 tsp ground anise seed and it was fine. Since the batch is divided, I knead cranberries into one half of the batch, and then drizzle the finaly product with white chocolate and sprinkle with almond slivers. The other half I knead in choc chips and toffee bits. YUM!

I'm not quite sure how to rate this one, this was my first time making and trying biscotti.  It was good, probably would be better with a cup of coffee or tea but I don't drink either of those.  I sent them to my husband (in Afghanistan) and didn't get much feedback from his guys (he didn't care for them.)  Tip: I shaped the dough right on the pan with oiled hands.

This is great basic recipe and very easy to kick it up for whatever you like.  Want to add chocolate chips, make it zesty, or perhaps nutty……go ahead its great and easy to do.  I also substitute the anise for almond, vanilla, or lemon extract depending on what I feel like making.  This biscotti is also just great as it is…yummy, yummy, and yummy!

These are fantastic, and easy. I baked them just a little, so they weren't so hard, then drizzled them with semi sweet chocolate chips melted.

I just found this recipe on this site this morning, have already made it, and found it was very good.  Subsituted the anise to 1 tsp lemon extract and 1 tsp vanilla and it was really good.  This one is definitly a keeper.

What a simple, lovely recipe.  The texture was perfect -- I made five different biscotti recipes this year at Christmas, and this one turned out best.  Because none of my family care for anise, I used real almond extract instead.  The flavor was delicate and the texture was crisp.  Awesome!

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at making biscotti. I made a few changes. First: I used vanilla extract because that is what I had on hand. Second I added 1/4 tsp each of cinamon and nutmeg. Finally, I added dried cherries and almonds to half the batter and drizzled the finished cookies with white chocolate.
 
For the other half, I dipped the finished cookies in a mixture of melted milk/semisweet chocolate and sliced almonds. 

This recipe was easy to make.  I followed the advice of handling the dough with damp hands, rather than adding flour. The damp hands trick (plus waxed paper) worked great. This dough is heavy and sticky.

The finished cookies were delicious and crisp. I gave them away as gifts, but I should have saved some for myself to have with a cup of espresso!

You don't need any other recipe than this one, it is PERFECT! I get so many compliments on these I have to make them every Christmas, if not I am in trouble.  I am not a fan of anise flavor so I use vanilla or almond or whatever.  I make plain and also add different items to these for flavor.  I usually drizzle on or dunk in chocolate too.  I am trying cranberry, pistachios, and white chocolate this year.

This is a great recipe. I cut it down to 14 servings, and cut them a bit thick and ended up with only 6. The idea of cutting it with a pizza cutter is great. I don't like anise, so I substituted with coconut extract. My husband couldn't wait for me to make coffee, he just started eating one! I had to stop him. Thank You JANDEE, and JANDEE's friend from work!

This was the first time I ever made biscotti and I was a little nervous, but it came out fine.  I need to work on the shape (I think my cookie sheets are too short) but the taste (I used almond and vanilla extracts, as previous reviewers had suggested) was great, as was the texture, even though I think I used a little too much flour. I will probably add sliced almonds next time - I was also thinking of dried cherries and dark chocolate chunks. A great, relatively simple, recipe!

Found this to be a very good and easy recipe.  Used 1/2 tsp. vanilla & 1/2 tsp. almond extract instead of anice(personal preference).  Also baked according to another's recommendation (350 for 20 min) and found them to be soft.  Cut immediately and baked add'l 4 min on each side.  This kept a soft texture to the cookie.   Added chopped pecans because it's what I had in my kitchen.  Found the cookies to be DELICIOUS!!   Definately a 5 Star recipe for me!!!  Thanks for sharing

I made these for a group of 140 of my nearest and dearest friends and they were a big hit.  To keep the slice-ability but improve the flavor, I used 1/4 c butter in place of half the oil, added 1/2 tsp salt, sliced almonds and a smidge of vanilla.  We also did a version substituting 2 tsp of vanilla and omitting the anice.  We sprinkled with a high quality cinnamon and they were fantastic, too.  This recipe is a real winner.

I've never made biscotti before this and I truly had no clue what I was doing. While I was making it, I thought I would give this recipe 4 stars because it's not really a firm dough...so I wouldn't say you can form it into a log shape. I didn't divide the dough either and just piled it up on my cookie sheet on parchment and shaped it into a reasonable shape and patted it down w/ damp hands (thanks to the reviewer who suggested wetting your hands!). I added slivered almonds and was making this as a gift to go in a basket fullof other homemade goodies. I was praying it would turn out! Well, it did! I had some really good size biscotti in the end and the taste is amazing! I also omitted the anise (didn't have any) and replaced it w/ 3/4 Tbsp almond extract and 1/4 Tbsp vanilla. I cut w/ a pizza cutter while still warm (almost hot) and while I was cutting, I put my hand at the opposite end of the slab of biscotti and pushed my fingers against it to prevent the end pieces from braking off when the pizza cutter passed through. It worked great! Thanks for the great recipe! I'll be making it again very soon!

Easy to follow with consistent results. I have made this recipe and varied the "add-ins" to get many different types of biscotti. They make a great teacher's treat... all of my children's teachers liked that they went well with coffee/tea, and that they don't go stale quickly.  I varied the add-ins and sprinkles depending on the seasons.

Awesome!   Followed everything exactly.  Didn't have anise extract, so I used half vanilla and half orange.  Very easy to make and delicious!  I used wax paper and wet my hands to shape the rolls and had no problems sticking.  They did stick to the cookie sheet though, but that's probably because I didn't grease it well enough.

The people I made it for said that the taste of the oil was too strong, and butter would have been better. Apart from that, an easy recipe (even though daunting at first) that turned out without problems!

I made these and followed the recipe to a T. except for adding almond extract instead of anise.  I also pulled them out of the oven and immediately cut them with a pizza cutter, it worked perfectly.  They didn't crumble at all.  They were a bit crunchy on the outside and dry-ish in the center - which is just how I like them.  They're perfect with a cup of coffee!  Got rave reviews from my father-in-law too.  I don't think I'll try another recipe, this one tastes good and it's so easy.

Best biscotti I've made! I love anise so I followed the recipe exactly. I drizzled some with white chocolate and left the others plain. They're perfect! My daughter and I tucked them into "end of the year" gift bags with tea and cocoa packets for her teachers. Thanks Jandee, for this easy, foolproof recipe!

Easy, fast and delicious! I used vanilla extract and threw in 1/4 c. of slivered toasted almonds for flavor and WOW, sooooo delicious. The baking and preparing were simple. I used a pizza cutter for easier cutting. I will definitely use this recipe many more times.

I love this recipe because it's good on its own or dipped in chocolate, but I can make so many variations from it. I usually substitute the anise oil/extract for 1 tbsp almond extract. FOR PEPPERMINT BISCOTTI substitute anise for 1 tbsp peppermint extract and add 1/2 cup semi sweet or white chocolate chips. I dip in chocolate or vanilla almond bark and then in crushed peppermint. FOR CHOCOLATE ORANGE BISCOTTI, use 1 tsp almond extract, add 1/2 cup orange zest and 1 1/2 cup sliced almonds. dip in chocolate or chocolate almond bark. FOR CHOCOLATE CHERRY BISCOTTI use almond extract, add 1/2 cup candied or dried cherries and 1/2 cup mini semi sweet chips. Drizzle with white chocolate or vanilla almond bark.

I was leery of using oil, because I heard biscotti should use butter, but they came out well in theory.  I think the butter might give it a much better flavor and I'll try that next time.  I used about 3 C and a tsbp flour.  Very easy recipe.  Texture was very nice. I, like many, did not have the anise.  So I used half almond, half vanilla.  I found the flavor lacking, and not quite sweet enough.  The anise or some kind of toasted nut would probably help a lot.  I know biscotti should have a mild flavor anyway, but I felt it did not compliment the flavor of coffee.  The coffee almost emphasized the lack of flavor.  But a very good biscotti "base" that I will experiment with.

Awesome recipe, I also swapped anise for 1/2 TB vanilla and almond extract, will use a bit more almond extract next time, tossed in chopped almonds and mini choc chips last time, this time am using walnuts and plan to dip in dark choc.  Followed the tips from Anitalouise and used the pizza cutter, easiest best biscotti recipe I have used, shamefully admit I finished it all off in a matter of days!!

Excellent recipe. Simple. Fast. One of the best I have ever used. I substituted butter rather than oil. Try both and decide which texture you prefer. I put 1/2 dram of anise oil in my recipe, and in another batch I used just vanilla. Great recipe to experiment with!

Yum yum yum!  Incredibly easy and tastes wonderful.  My hubby and I aren't big on anise, so I substituted vanilla extract and threw in a little cinnamon.  Tasted wonderful!

I think this recipe would be better with butter instead of oil. I used vanilla instead of anise; perhaps because of this, I found the biscotti a little bland (even with chocolate chips added).

Delicious! I halved this recipe (using 2 small eggs), and dipped the finished product in dark chocolate. This is the best basic biscotti recipe that I've seen to date, and I'm planning on playing around with various flavorings. I love the fact that it's more traditional than other biscotti recipes I've seen (no butter, only eggs and oil), and lends itself well to customizing. My next biscotti hit? Probably orange zest and slivered almonds, with almond extract in the place of anise. And then, some tiramisu with cognac and espresso... the possibilities are endless!

Wow, this is great.  I decided to experiment and make this without anise, because I didn't have any on hand, and it's still fantastic.  They cut so perfectly, they end up looking like what you would buy at a bookstore.

I make biscotti for gifts and to share. This is my favorite recipe and easily lends itself to modification. I use almonds, dried cranberries, lemon or orange zest and a variety of flavored extracts. It always performs beautifully. I highly recommend this recipe for your collection!

Fantastic! Yummy! Perfect with a cup of tea/coffee/hot chocolate. I add almonds to my batch, and drizzle them with chocolate. Note: I did have problems slicing them, but even the broken pieces disappear quickly. :)

This was my first try at biscotti, and I loved this recipe.  May not be "purist", but you can use orange juice and dried cranberries, or almonds and toffee bits, or my fam's favorite choc chips and walnuts.  Electric knife is perfect for slicing without breaking.

Thanks for this recipe! This is my starting point then add in anything we want. I use a special biscotti pan given to me, when we cook the dough. It doesn't make as many even when I cut the recipe in half, but the pan makes it much easier. My daughter loves to make these cookies!

Supremely infallible. You can't go wrong with this biscotti. We always add anise seeds instead of extract -- and cut down the baking time just a bit. Our favourite: adding grand marnier and orange zest with some dark chocolate.

Great recipe.  I ran out of anise extract so I mixed half and half with vanilla extract and the Biscottis turned out great.  I melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips and mixed them with milk to coat the end of the biscottis, but they turned out to be better w/o the chocolate.

really great and simple recipe.  The dough wasn't sticky at all, more like a pie dough... i might have done something wrong, but it turned out great.  I split the dough in two and kneaded in dried fruit and nuts in one, and mini chocolate chips in the other.  This is a great basic recipe where you can add your own touch.  Definitely the best I've tried.

This was definately what I was looking for; however, it needs way more than 1 t. almond extract as someone suggested (sub for anise).  Will add more extract + almonds next time.  Way too boring this go 'round.

These were pretty simple, but mine turned out really crumbly so I had to add some milk to form the "dough" ball. I then just rolled them out into "finger" like forms and baked them for 25 min. They turned out more like Peppernuts, or "dog bones" as I nicknamed them. They taste awesome regardless, little on the crunchy side, but hey for the first time, I think I did pretty well. Gonna try again, way too good to give up on.

This was my first time making Biscotti and they turned out great. I followed the advice from JOYINABASKET and only baked the rolls for 10 minutes and then baked the slices for 5 minutes per side. I had no problems with crumbling when trying to slice. I used anise extract, and while I don't tend to like the anise flavor, this case was an exception. I'm going to try them with almond flavoring next time but the anise flavor is going to be a mainstay I think. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is try #2. I made them last year and was not happy. They were much better this time. I used 2 tbs almond extract instead and added almonds to 1/2 a log. I also used eggwhites instead of whole eggs. They are not too dry, which I like. Will try to add ingredients to make it tastier.

Very easy and very tasty.  My family loved it.  I used vanilla instead of the anise.  I also divided the dough and added chocolate to 1/2 and it was very good.

So easy to make, and my family was so impressed!  I used this as a base recipe and changed the flavors of the biscotti quite easily.

The only thing I had to change was the baking time.  I baked the rolled out dough for about 15 minutes instead of the suggested bake time.  Also, it's important to cut these wayyyy before the dough has a chance to cool down, or else you will have a tough time cutting without crumbling!

I will definitely make this again!

This was sooo simple and delish!!!!  My husband asked what other kind was I making today.  I was always afraid to make biscotti thinking it was too complicated... This was so easy!! I did make the anise, and did put a tablespoon and a half in ..Perfect!!

Super Easy!!  I love that I don't have to let butter come to room temperature for this recipe.  I had it in the oven 20 minutes after I print the recipe.  It is a huge hit with all who have tried it.  I baked mine on my Silpat mat & it was so easy to take off the pan & cut & repan.  If you can use anise, do use it.  It can be hard to find.  I found mine in a discount grocery store, but my grandfather-in-law finds it at a compounding pharmacy (they are more common than you think - try the yellow pages).  It gives your biscotti an authentic taste that many people just can't place (it tastes kind of like licorice), but don't let the anise keep you from trying this recipe.  A+++ for a super easy Christmas gift recipe.  Give with chocolate spoons & cappuccino mix.

the taste is a little too floury for a biscotti. probably because i added extra flour as the dough is really sticky and messy. however, it bakes really nicely and still decent on the whole. i substituted anise for alomond and vanilla extract.

I loved this recipe.  Perfect starting off point-I added coconut and almond extract instead of anise.  I thought the recipe was super easy and the biscotti turned out fantastic.

Kind of bland as-is. I used a cup of slivered almonds and vanilla extract instead of anise. Would recommend adding cinnamon or something else to give flavor.

These are very good, I omitted the anis and added vanilla and almond extract and added almonds. Then I dipped the bottom half in chocolate.

Like some other people wrote, my dough was very sticky. I added more flour and it didn't rise well! I used double the anise extract but still the flavor was weak.

A GREAT BISCOTTI RECIPE!  I love the texture, not chewy at all.  I used 1 tbsp vanilla instead of anise and added chocolate chips and followed the rest of the recipe exactly cooking it on parchement paper (also turned down oven 25 degrees since baking on a dark pan).  Cut with a very sharp non serated knife to avoid crumbling and be sure and toast them until they are almost rock hard.

I was amazed how easy this is.  I love biscotti, and was anxious to try making it at home.  I found my dough to be very sticky, so I had to add another 1/2 cup flour to the mix.  I didn't have anise, so I used vanilla instead.  It was still great.  Also, I used a dark pan for baking, so the edges looked burnt, but they still tasted great!  Thanks!!

The first time I ever made biscotti hehe. It turned out quite well, I wasn't all that fond of the cracks that appeared on the first baking but that's no fault of the recipe. The anise flavour was a little too weak for my liking though, and I'd reccomend add 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of anise extract rather than just 1 tablespoon.

All in all this was probably one of the simplest biscuit recipes I've ever made and will definetely do this one again.  And no, simple does not mean bad.

This is a great recipe. It is so versatile. I've used the suggestions given by a previous reviewer, "AMINAH", and the biscotti are just soooooo delicious. I also use olive oil rather than vegetable oil. This recipe is easier to make than running that extra errand to purchase the cookies.

We made these for our holiday gift baskets.  We did not use anise at all, but made 3 varieties that are getting rave reviews from the basket recipients.  -christmas spice (mentioned in another review) drizzled with chocolate -orange cranberry  -lemon poppy seed with one end dipped in white chocolate!!  All were fabulous!!

Great biscotti! I used this basic recipe and added 1 cup chopped pistachios and 1/2 cup dried cranberries, along with about 1 tsp orange zest. Also, I used vanilla (didn't have anise), and decreased the baking powder to 1 tsp (comparing it to other biscotti recipes using the same amt of flour/sugar). Next time I'll dip in chocolate. These are really good, and I'll be making them for Christmas gifts.

I altered this recipe a little by leaving out the anise and using mexican vanilla instead.  I also added a bit of ground ginger.  It turned out great and was a huge hit at the coffee shop I work at.  I have also been using brown sugar and molasses for 1/2 of the white sugar, and added cranberries and pistachios for a yummy Christmas treat.

Excellent Biscotti.  I have made this receipe several times and have changed the flavoring around a bit.  I used 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vanilla extract one time.  That was a bit hit.  The next time I tried lemon extract with a bit of lemon peel.  I have also tried orange extract with a bit of orange rind and some dried sweetened cranberries - YUM!!  My family gobbled them up!  A keeper

Easy and delicious biscotti!  I love the fact that they contain oil, not butter, as this adds to the ease of making them.  I do have anise extract, but I chose to use 1 tablespoon of almond extract instead.  I drizzled the tops with melted chocolate and they were perfect to dunk, or just enjoy with a glass of milk.  This recipe is so versatile, you could also add your extras (nuts, flavorings, liqueur) and they would be yummy.

My first time making biscotti and they turned out great.  These are very good for such a simple reicpe.  I had to make a second batch for my sister to take home.  My kids were not crazy about them, not sweet enough, but that just means more for me!

Basically really good. I melted baker's chocolate, poured it on a sheet of waxed paper and pushed the bottom of the warm biscotti loaf into the chocolate - then cut it after the chocolate hardened. Also also changed the 1 cup veg oil for 1 cup butter. Rich but good tasting

Use butter instead of oil, too much flour in this recipe. The hazelnuts, fine chocolate, and vanilla add ins saved the recipe somewhat,  but expensive for a just ok outcome.

I thought that a tablespoon of Baking Soda was too much so I cut it down to 2 tsp; I think maybe only one tsp is needed. I like my biscotti more dense so that it doesn’t crumble or fall apart when dunked in coffee.

What a wonderful simple recipe! This is my go-to biscotti recipe. I  bake the loaves for 20 minutes, then I bake the biscotti for about 8 minutes per side after slicing. I've tried adding different flavors, almonds, walnuts, etc. All yummy. For us, dipping in chocolate is a must. The longer you let them sit, the better the flavor. I make a batch about every two weeks

Great recipe and made it seem so easy.
Through other reviews I opted to a to split the sugar to half white half brown. Instead of anise I used a TB of vanilla and a teaspoon of almond extract.  I also add a 1/4 tsp each of ground clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and coriander.

Although tasty, I tried making this twice because I could never get the dough as “gooey” as shown in the video. When I finally got something I could work with, they came out dry and almost like saw dust.  I may have turned my Bubbie off his favorite cookie!

Perfectly crunchy just like from a professional. Received many compliments. The only change I made was adding a cup of chopped almonds. People asked for the recipe so I will be passing it on. Thank you!

Made these for Christmas gifts - used combos of dried cranberries, cherries or blueberries and almonds or pecans. Also used almond extract or lemon for the blueberry ones, in place of the anise. Used 1 teaspoon vanilla in addition to extracts cuz it makes everything taste better.. Used  half brown sugar and half white for the sugar.

The only changes I made were using vanilla extract and duck eggs instead of chicken. While the bake was technically good, the taste was awful and flavorless. Like a big chunk of dull, flat, baked flour. The chocolate and pistachio could not save what was intended to be gifts. I had a professional baker taste one and her immediate reaction was one, yea, AWFUL, and two, it needed salt. Look for other recipes that include salt which help all the other flavors work. Do not make the same sad mistake I did.

I didn't use the anise flavoring.  I substituted with one teaspoon of vanilla and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract. I also added 1 cup of lightly toasted chopped almonds to the batter.
This is a winner recipe for me. Simple and delicious. I might back off on the sugar a bit next time. I haven't decided.

I don’t know whether to give it a rating because my oven may be partly  at fault or maybe because I tried to chill the dough first to make it easier to work with? But I found these to be very bland and the biscotti didn’t rise as much as it usually does with my other recipes. I thought I would try this because it had 4+ stars but I will go back to my usual recipe. Two stars for simple ingredients.

The dough can be a little sticky. My solution is to  put it into two balls and set  each  on a piece of slightly floured plastic wrap the length of your pan. lightly cover with the plastic wrap and shape into log . you can use the plastic wrap as a guide. The slight bit of flour on the plastic wrap will make the logs easy to handle. Press then roll them out to the proper thickness , flip them over onto the parchment paper covered pan and you're good to go. very easy and I'm sure you would have thought of it by yourself.

Wonderful recipe! I made mine with Tbsp almond extract, chopped almonds and chopped craisins. Baked for 20 min, took advice of another reviewer and sliced with pizza cutter. Did rebake for 5 min on each side. My oven was running hot I think. We LOVED these! Next time I’ll make a batch with anise oil. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was  my first time making biscotti, and OMG!!!!!  This was awesome!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  Then I added in 1.5 tbls of orange zest and almost 2 cups of dried cranberries.  My mother who doesn't care for biscotti tasted them and couldn't believe how delicious they were.  I passed them around and they didn't even make it 24 hours before they were all gone.  

I am now adding them to my Christmas cookie tray and will include several varieties.  Thank you so much this awesome addition to my recipe book!

On a side note:  I have been very spoiled by my sister who lives in Brooklyn, and have a had the most delicious biscotti ever from NYC.  Because of this I am always hesitant to try it anywhere else, and I certainly didn't think I would be able to make it.  This was easy and delicious and I will no longer need her to bring me some from miles away.  :)

I followed the recipe for the most part. I used vanilla extract in place of the Anise. I also added approximately 1/4c mini chocolate chips and 1/4c crushed walnuts. They came out FANTASTIC! I'm making another 2 batches on Monday! One will be lemon and almond and the other will be chocolate and Peppermint.

As others mention, great biscotti recipe.  Excellent texture and flavor - no need to add flour but super starting point to add flavorings, nuts, dried fruit etc.  I, too, shaped the two ‘loaves’ directly on a silpat.  Thanks for the hint about cutting while hot - though the pizza wheel didn’t work as well as a serated knife for me.  Looking forward to trying flavor variations. Absolutely made my afternoon cappuccino on the patio feel special - might as well have been sitting along an Italian sidewalk - lol.

Made 2 batches this morning.  I added 2 Tbsps of orange zest and about 1 cup of Craisins to the flour mixture.  I added 1 tsp of orange extract oil to the egg mixture.  Yes the dough was sticky but I moistened my hands and everything worked fine.  They are delicious!!!  NOTE:  I didn’t use anise or other flavorings.

Very good, very easy, and they look beautiful! I don't have any anise flavouring - so I've used a tablespoon of orange liqueur, or half vanilla/half sambuca  instead and they are delicious. I've adjusted the quantities a bit - I use a little less baking powder (as I could taste it with 1 tablespoon) and a little less oil, without seeming to compromise the consistency or taste. I also add a pinch of salt just to brighten the flavour a bit.  I find that they don't crumble or break as much if I cut them as soon as I can once they are out of the oven - still hot to the touch.

I made this cake for a group that visited my Camp.  I was a bit nervous because it was my first and I had never tasted it.  Well, my guests, staff and I loved it.

Thank you!!

I loved it, and will definitely make it again. However,  we baked it for  25 minutes  at the correct temperature and the bottom still got burned. But the delicious flavor and smell was amazing and I immediately forgot about the burn!

Easy & will make again!  The tips are excellent- I baked 18 mins (gas oven) & they were crispy.  A little less flavor than I’d hoped, but will keep using this as a base recipe.  Thank you!

Easy!! It was my first time making it and it couldn't have been any easier. I did put 1/2 tbsp almond extract and 1/2 vanilla instead of anis. Then regretted and added an extra 1/2 of almond. Tastes very good but I do wish I had made them smaller. Could have easily yielded 4 logs which I plan on doing next time

GR8, plain biscotti. I used vanilla instead of anise. Perfect to accompany a mug of cocoa. I will make this again but I will triple the vanilla in them. And possibly add nuts or something.

I used this as written except I added slivered almonds, dried cranberries and almond flavoring and added white chocolate drizzles over the top (candy making drops, melted). It was pretty good!  It was very easy and my first time making biscotti.  I cut with a pizza cutter when it was still hot, turned the pieces on their sides and returned to the oven for a few minutes.  Everyone thought it was really good but I personally would have liked it a bit sweeter.  Next time I will try orange extract  with cranberry and almonds and a little more sugar.  Overall this is a great recipie and so easy.

Made these exactly as written only I used vanilla because that was what I had on hand, I put the dough directly onto the cookie sheet and pressed it out.  The dough was really dry but the cookie came out perfectly, I did not bother letting it cool before slicing, I used a good bread knife and it when through like butter, no crumbling at all...will definitely make these again but am going to try almond exact next time.

Everyone loves this biscotti cookie I made..... the only change I made was excluding the anise extract and added vanilla extract instead.

Good basic biscotti recipe.  As others did, I left out the anise and added vanilla this time. I’ll be trying it again and adding more adventurous flavorings!  I also added about 1/2 cup more flour to make it "shapeable ".

These were absolutely amazing! Perfect crunch...not too hard. I was hemming and hawing at biscotti recipes for so long( having had no luck with a good one) and then I found this one! I used almond and vanilla extracts and 1 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts. I baked for about 5 min on each side for the second bake. They were better than store bought and sooo much cheaper. Thanks for sharing!

I added a cup of sliced almonds, and instead of anise, half tbsp vanilla and half a tbsp almond extract. Also threw in some dashes of cumin, coriander, and nutmeg, and made a chocolate bottom/drizzle with Ghirardelli chocolate chips mixed with some Nutella and crisco. These are beautiful!

I've made this biscotti several times.  It's my "go-to"  recipe.  I've tried other biscotti recipes, but I keep returning to this one.  I actually prefer the vegetable oil over butter.  It gives it a better texture.  You can dress this up, or down.  It's simple to add different extracts, nuts, even chips (chocolate, butterscotch).  I  tend to prefer it just the way it is, except I substitute the anise for vanilla extract.

Perfect recipe - I made it as directed for the first batch, it was so good - I made it again with anise flavoring - again perfect -and then I made some with pumpkin spices - so good too - I ended up with 4 batches for my nephew's wedding and they received rave reviews!!!!  Thankyou - the recipe was easy and directions straightforward.

Great basic recipe. Substituted 1 cup almond flour for 1 cup wheat flour. Next time will try substituting 2 cups almond flour and adding some toasted, slivered almonds.

The first time I made these I hated it because it was so messy.  For future attempts I realized that all I needed was plenty of flour for working with and shaping the dough on the cookie sheet.  Flour the cookie sheet, flour your hands, have plenty of it.  I skip the TBSP of anise extract and do about 2/3 TBSP of vanilla and 1/3 TBSP of almond extract instead.  I do the minimum for all of the cooking times, 25, 6, and 6 minutes.  These are great and always well received!

I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies did not rise much. They were very dense and heavy, instead of light and crisp. The flavor was okay but not great. I don't know how to change the recipe so the cookies will rise more.

I made these because I needed something I could make for a crowd a day ahead. I also appreciate the frugality and ease of oil instead of butter. I made a "S'mores" variation by omitting anise and adding marshmallow flavor, wheat germ and chocolate chips. I also partially dipped the finished cookies in melted chocolate. They were a huge hit with my extended family, especially the kids. I will absolutely make these again.

Needs 1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt but good recipe for the first time ever making biscotti.  I like the traditional type with the anise and then added 1/2 stick of the Odense grated almond paste.  Great flavor, reduced temp to 350 and will try great suggestions from reviewers on cocoa or cranberries or xtra toasted sliced almonds.  THANX!

I only changed the flavor extracts to half vanilla and half almond extract.  Next time will use all almond extract.  The recipe needs to mention size of sheet pan, as some are smaller than others. Size of pan changes size of biscotti and cooking time. Otherwise very good and easy to make. I must say though that my dough was not sticky. I followed the directions to a “T”.

I made one change to this - I substituted vanilla extract for the anise. I wanted something a little more familiar for my young sons to smell and taste.

The recipe is very easy to follow, and even though the batter is kind of gooey, it doesn't need any added flour. I cut the batter in half and scooped each portion onto reusable parchment paper. I ran cold water over my hands and left them slightly damp while I formed the loaf shape to help prevent the batter from sticking to my fingers. 

They baked beautifully and smell wonderful. They are light, sweet, and crispy crunchy! I am definitely using this recipe again, and I'll be playing with different flavors!

My recipe was a mix of a couple I’ve seen on this thread—including cinnamon & nutmeg for a holiday feel (and smell). The only thing I did differently was I added the wet ingredients into the dry (the recipe calls for the other way around), and this only because my wet ingredient bowl was too small. I don’t know if that’s the cause, but my dough was not nearly as sticky as it should’ve been. It was more crumbly, like a pie crust. Regardless, the flavor and smell was fantastic & I would certainly make this again.

So quick and easy and you can add any flavorings to your taste!  I’ve made many other biscotti recipes, this is by far the only one I’ll use from now on.

Made this recipe twice in 5 days.  First try was sensational.  2nd try was a complete bust.  I'm sure it's my error but I don't know of anything I did different.  
2nd time it didn't rise at all and overbaked in the same time as I baked the first.  Same rack positon.  Maybe third time is the charm.

This recipe is perfect. I changed it up just slightly, using three tablespoons of anise seeds (that I grounded up) and I sprinkled a light mixture of sugar and cinnamon on top before the first baking. This recipe will be my new “go to”.

Mine were a little dry, but I used grapeseed oil and it may not be "heavy" enough. I'll try olive oil next time. I added slivered almonds since the recipe didn't mention them, but the photo showed almonds. I was happy I did. The friend I gave them too liked them and was happy to have them.

My first attempt at this was catastrophic, mostly because the measurements are in volume, not weight.  I think this is why so many people had to add or decrease flour to get it right.  With 3-1/4 cups of flour, my dough consistency was like caramel.  I simply didn't have the body strength to stir it.  So into the waste basket it went.  On my second try, I used 390g flour.  This gave me the correct consistency.  Like virtually everyone else, I substituted almond extract and added some vanilla because vanilla is wonderful on everything except tacos.  I found the individual biscottis to be a bit on the small side, so I'll probably increase the ingredients by 50% on the next go round.  I like the possibilities that this recipe presents and I'm looking forward to trying some other reviewers' ideas, like orange, cranberry and white chocolate.  Coffee was twice as much fun this morning!

This is the first time I've made Biscotti so I really searched for an easy recipe to make. I am from Canada, so our flour is apparently different. I did follow the recipe to the T and it was super super dry, some of the flour wouldn't even mix in. What I did was added about 1 cup of milk to the recipe until it was the consistency that it should have been. If you're from Canada just be aware of this. The rest of the recipe I followed as far as cooking times and it was perfect. The resulting cookie was just as I'd hoped. Great flavour and texture. I'd definitely make this again!

Great classic biscotti and I've made it often - sometimes as written, and often using it as a base for creating different variations of the cookie.  This Xmas I've made it once verbatim, and I've got a chocolate-amaretto batch in the oven right now (used olive oil, subbed 1/2 cup cocoa for same amt of flour, added a bit more sugar, & a cpl of TBSPs  Frangelico + few drops Amaretto oil in place of anise).
Yum.

This is by far the best biscotti recipe I have ever used, and the only one that I continue to use. I will make this super simple with 2 tablespoons of vanilla as my flavoring, and I have also filled it with dried cranberries and pistachios with half of it dipped in white chocolate! If you can imagine, this recipe can be adapted. Do not add more flour! This is a very sticky though. I just plop it evenly on two separate cookie sheets covered in parchment, generously dust it in my hands with Flower and pat it into shape just like some of the other reviewer’s have done. I only bake it for 20 minutes before I immediately slice it with the pizza cutter While it’s still hot to prevent crumbling and toast each side for five minutes thereafter. It is perfect.

I am so happy I found this recipe!  I was nervous to make these as I had a terrible experience with another biscotti recipe.  I read the reviews and followed the advise given about not adding any  additional flour.  I formed the dough right on the baking sheet.  I used Anise oil.  They smell and taste so good!  Next up, I will be making almond biscotti with sliced almonds.

These are very tasty, but the dough was very stiff,  so I had to add an egg for moisture. I might increase the oil, too, next time, or decrease the flour a little. 

I added cranberries and pistachios...my favorite kind of biscotti.

I used this to make biscotti spoons.  I have a silicon mold that I am making candy spoons in and got a hairbrain idea about biscotti spoons.  I tried this recipe and it worked perfect!  I rolled the dough in ropes, laying and twisting it into the silicon mold then patting down with my fingers.  15 minutes to bake.  I thought with just the first bake, they were perfect.  Next step is dipping and decorating with chocolate!

This is a great biscotti recipe and you can make many variations of it. Be careful when baking because I've found that it often starts burning around 27 minutes in my oven.

Today I tried making a maple walnut biscotti, and it was a mess. The dough was wayy too sticky to shape, and the biscotti was pointy :P However, it still tasted great, and I'm obviously not going to count this failure into my rating because I changed the recipe a lot. Just wanted to add this experience here to let you guys know your twists on this recipe might not always work.

I used vanilla flavor and drizzled chocolate on top. Analouise suggested cutting dough to strips while in the pan beforehand. This worked perfectly. Very easy to make. My daughter has been to Italy and said they tasted authentic. Personally, I would addore sugar next time.

So good! I omitted the anise in exchange for vanilla. Then I added a whole bag of Heath bits and pieces plus 1/4 c flax meal.(ground flax). To finish off I drizzle chocolate on top and sprinkle  with sea salt.

I make this all the time, as printed. My very favorite biscotti. If you don't bake it as long, it's not crunchy, but still firm. Thank goodness they keep great in a tin box, or I'd eat them all at once!

The dough was so dry I had to add another egg, then when I tasted it after it had backed there was so much baking powder in it you are left feeling like you brushed your tongue which is no where near nice. I am very disappointed in this, I was really excited to make some biscotti.

Very easy recipe that goes amazingly well with some milky black tea. The only changes I made were subbing anise extract with almond extract and topping with a little bit of honey drizzle. I also baked mine for less time than what the recipe suggests.

Super easy to make and comes out great every time.  Allows for a variety of flavor profiles.  I've added Nutella with chopped hazelnuts as well as a gingerbread version (ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove).  I think you could add almost anything you like to create unique/favorite flavored biscotti.

Lovely recipe. I buy my eggs from a local store, so they  vary in size, thus, I tend to reduce the amount of flour for this recipe if I get eggs that are a bit smaller than usual. Also, I chop up the almonds roughly in a blender (one I use for smoothies) and mix it into the dry ingredients for them to better incorporate.

it was really simple and turned out well, i used vanilla instead of anise and added whole almonds (1/4 cup aprox) and dried cranberries (1/4 cup aprox)  for some more flavour.

I made it, and it turned out great. Then I tried different approach. But I want to experiment with it a bit, replace oil with butter, replace anise extract with vanilla extract, and add cranberries/raisins, and pumpkin seeds. I'm working with what's already in the pantry.

I never made biscotti before, and didn't know how easy it would be. I halved the recipe and used anise seeds because that's all I had on hand. I used a biscotti pan that I just bought on a whim. I think it will be getting a lot of use!

Made exactly as written; though I did split the dough into two separate portions and add pine nuts in one of the portions.  I have an induction oven so my cook time was a little less.  Just follow the rule when biscotti starts to crack it's done.  I also dipped mine in chocolate; you know for the wife.

This was a wonderful treat! Tastes like the classic and its easy to make.  I chopped up almonds and chocolate chips for mine and it added a little sparkle to it.  The only addition I made was a pinch of salt.  This recipe is going in the archives for sure!

Wife made it recently. Solid recipe, easy to make. The only thing I'd consider trading out is almond extract for anise...the smell of anise reminds me too much of italian sausage.

Not a cook and this is easy and delicious. I tried varieties of different flavorings - orange extract, almond extract.. and varieties of different chocolate drizzle - all great. Comparatively, I tried a recipe with butter, and i liked this veggie oil version better. More flavor. Enjoy!

I've just made a Christmas version of these, adding a little mixed candied peel, some dried cranberries and a few chopped pistachios (I also missed out the anise and added vanilla instead). They have turned out beautifully.

With regards to several people saying the dough was too sticky - this might be because using cup measurements for something like this is just not ever going to be accurate. I used the standard 120g conversion for each cup of flour and the dough was perfect. A set of digital scales costs less than ten dollars and will save you a lot of money in wasted ingredients!

Great recipe!  I used 1-1 Gluten free flour, butter and ground anise seed as I didn't have anise oil or extract ( I used 1 tablespoon ground anise seed, using  electric coffee grinder).  Delicate flavor,  just what I wanted.

These are great!  I used almond extract, as well as 1/2 cup almond slices and 1/2 cup chopped dried cranberries.  Chilled the dough to make it easier to work with.  I also found 20 minutes was plenty for the first round of baking.

Very good base recipe for biscotti. I made it several times in a variety of flavors: almond, chocolate orange, pumpkin spice, lemon poppy seed etc. and it always works out great. One change I made early on: I use 100g (4 oz) of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil instead of the oil alone. The dough is more flexible and less sticky, allowing you to work it better without adding additional flour. The result: softer yet crunchier cookie without the "sandy texture" that my wife described after making the original recipe.

I've tried to make biscotti before and it turned out horrible. I am not the best baker. HOWEVER, these were not only super easy but, super delish and versatile. I used vanilla instead of anise. Also, half the biscottis I added almonds. So easy!!

Love the texture for this biscotti. Even though I'm not a big fan of anise, it was mild and not overpowering. I think this will be my go to recipe for the biscotti base and will add my own mixtures/flavors. I would wait 10 mins next time before cutting since the sides had a tendency to crumble when I waited 5 mins. Absolutely great texture. My daughter described it as the inside of a Whopper. * UPDATE* Made a batch with vanilla extract and almond extract with 1 cup of slivered almonds. Both combinations tasted great! I want to try a pistachio and then a hazelnut mixture next time.

My best friend and I made this biscotti with almond extract instead of anise, and only cooked it once, but we still thought it was tasty.

Did my first run through, and it turned out wonderfully! 
REALLY large yield though, so any future batches, I think I'll half!

Got great reviews, and now I can start tweaking the recipe to bring in some more flavors!

I love that it is not too sweet. I can make white chocolate and cranberry biscotti and it is just perfect.

Best biscotti recipe ever. I've tried many but this recipe always yields the perfect crunchy and dry biscotti,  without turning the biscotti into a hard  rock! I follow the recipe as it is. Recipe also works well with all kinds of add ons. In my oven I have to reduce the baking time or biscotti will get too dark like a toast. Since the dough is very sticky, I just mix the flour in with a wooden spatula, very quickly, mixing  just enough to form  a dough.  I  also keep my hands very wet while I shape the dough on the baking sheets. Best of all, this recipe is always a great success with family and friends!

Loved this easy to make, tasty biscotti! When  the finished product came out of the oven looking so pretty and the house smelled so fragrant I was very pleased. The fact that they are delicious is the icing on the cake! I did add walnuts to my recipe, yummy!!

I make these quite often with several variations.  I don't like anise flavouring so I usually substitute it.  My favorite are vanilla extract and chocolate chips or almond extract .  Perfect companion to coffee.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I changed the oil to 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup butter.  I also used 1/2 tbs vanilla and 1/2 tbs almond extract.  I added about 1 cup sliced almonds.  Biscotti is sooo expensive to buy but now I have a winner recipe that is simple to make and delicious!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I use this recipe every Christmas for my assortment of cookies. I always use oilve oil instead of vegetable - for authentic Itailian biscotti and a variation of dried fruit and nuts . You can use different extracts and add in's NP!! Quick easy simple no fail recipe! Can be doubled NP! You can do one log instead of 2 for bigger biscotti - cook same amount of time. Love it! Thanks for sharing

This is an easy recipe. I used 1 and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour  and 2 cups unbleached white flour, added an additional egg, and 2 drops of clove oil.  Wheat flour makes the dough heavier but healthier so the extra egg helped it rise accordingly.  
I frosted them with confectioners sugar, anise extract and light cream. 
I don't re-bake them as I don't like them crispy. 
Just cut  diagonally after  frosting and serve. 
My neighbor is from Italy and had been making biscotti her whole life and really loved them. 
When she found out how easy the recipe was, she made them for Easter. 
This recipe is a keeper.

Love this recipe! I made it twice now with 2 different flavors. First one was with lemon zest inside and a lemon icing drizzle. Second time was with orange extract, cinnamon and chocolate chips inside and a chocolate drizzle. Dipped into coffee... eyes rolling back delicious!

Super easy, great texture, not many modifications needed to make this one a winner! I love that this isn't a tooth breaker, its a bit more delicate, but the dough is easy to work with.  I did choose almond extract and a bit of vanilla instead of anise, and it was delicious.

Super easy to make. Watch the amount of flour too much can cause dough to be dry. I like hard biscotti that stand a dunk in tea or coffee so I toast til golden brown. Often i add almonds and love the taste of anise so i add a little more than called for.

This is surely an easy recipe that everyone should give it a try! Though many people say that it is better to use less flour such that the biscotti will not be too hard, I find the mixture too runny to be made into a dough! So you have to judge it by your experience. Actually, I think it may be because that I use a small cup to measure the flour, so it turns out that there is too much egg. Maybe next time, I will use two eggs instead of three. Also, I think it is better to cut the dough into slices when it is still warm such that it will not be too crispy and crack into pieces.

I've never made biscotti and am a total a rookie in the kitchen.  I got this recipe on your AR video and I honestly have no need to try any other recipes because these came out splendidly.  I feel like I'm eating the fancy pants biscotti I pick up at a local coffee shops for several dollars a piece.  Totally took the mystery out of them.  For my first batch I used a teaspoon of almond extract and omitted the anise which I am not a big fan of.  I now think of all the flavor possibilities ahead that will be based off of this recipe.  Family and friends are going to get dosed with these beauties.

I used white whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour, and replaced the sugar with 1/2 cup Truvia baking blend.  I also added 1/2 cup slivered almonds.  This was very easy to make, and even with my healthier substitutions, very good biscotti.

This is the third time I baked this recipe. This time I used Brown sugar. I added the egg mixture to the sifted flour. The dough did not come out sticky... But the biscottis were great. Does anyone know why?

Thank You

Perfect basic Biscotti recipe. 
I do add a little salt and yet to try it with anise. 
Quick and simple recipe you can personalize. Orange zest, sliced  almonds, and my favorite, bits of caramelized pecans.

I enjoy the recipe for the texture of the biscotti. Generally, I like to add my own spices and mix-ins.  My favorite so far is cinnamon and dried cranberries.

I made this and I am very pleased and give it a 5 star rating!  I read many of the reviews and did the following:  I baked for 18 minutes and 8 minutes on one side and 5 minutes on the other side.  I used almond pure extract and vanilla pure extract and used walnuts because I didn't have any almonds. Fantastic and I will be using this recipe as a basic for my biscotti going forward.

If you feel like there's too much anise at the start,  it becomes less overpowering as it bakes. Loved it- added brown sugar and cherries.

I made this exactly as instructed, using a mix-master. Turned out great!  I pressed raw almonds into the raw dough, but that made slicing a little tricky.

I have been making these for the last three years to give out at Christmas and my friends and family love them!  They are easy to make and delicious.  I use almond extract instead of anise extract but otherwise I keep everything the same.

Just pulled this out of the oven from the second bake.  I don't use sugar so I substituted Splenda and it turned out pretty well.  The dough was a little crumbly but that might be because of the Splenda.  When I was forming the dough I used wax paper to help shape it up because it was a little crumbly.  Also, I didn't have anise extract so I used vanilla.  I tasted a little bit off the end and it has such a nice subtle sweetness.  I think I will give them a nice dip in some milk chocolate when they're cooled off.  Can't wait to have these after dinner!  I will absolutely use this recipe as a starting base dough for any flavor combos I'd like to try.

A very good biscotti base! Made two batches.  For the first one, I followed the original recipe. For the second one, i've decided to switch the anise for vanilla extract, i've also added dried cranberries and dipped the biscottis in white chocolate. Yummers !

This is my go to recipe every year! You do not need to add extra flour!! Traditional biscotti dough is very wet, so what you do is you wet your hands before shaping, and make sure your pans and everything are ready :) If too much flour is added they become dense and teeth breaking, not light and crumbly/crispy. Thank you for this recipe!

Great base recipe. You can add any flavoring you want to this and it would be great.  I cut them too thick the first time but the taste was great. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is dairy free! I make it probably once a month or more. It is so perfect for dipping in tea because they get soft but not mushy and do not fall apart at all. Because this is an oil based dough, the dough is somewhat crumbly, but I find if I hold back on a little flour, it remains sticky but still easy enough to handle. I customize this by adding in dried fruit or almonds; I've gotten creative and turned this into gingerbread biscotti and I plan on making a cocoa-based one closer to Christmas.

I substituted half vanilla and half almond extract, because I don't care for anise.  I also toasted 1/2 cup sliced almonds, ground them in my coffee grinder, and substituted that amount for some of the flour. Oh...My...Gosh!  They're so great!  I probably spread them a little too thin for the first bake, but they still turned out delicious!

I made the following changes: 1 c. brown rice flour, 1 c. white rice flour and the rest a.p. flour.  1 T. almond and "my vanilla" extracts.  Split the dough in 2; with one I added tranquility mix from Aldi. With the other I used 7 minute icing and then dipped into unsweetened coconut to top off after flipping them for second toasting. Both turned out really nice. Thanks for posting ;-D

I like it because it's a simple recipe with consistent results.I usually add dry fruit and chopped nuts. I've even had success with soaking dried fruit in liqueurs like amaretto or Grande Marnier before tossing them in with a couple of TBS of the liqueur instead of extract.

This recipe is quick and easy but absolutely delicious.  I followed the advice another reader mentioned to use a little oil on your hands when handling the dough. That tip worked out well. (Thank you) I can't wait to try other variations.....like orange and cranberry or pistachio and cranberry. The choices are unlimited.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. Definitely a holiday and more recipe I will go to.

I have made this numerous times and always need to add more flour.  I probably end up using close to 5 cups in order to get it to hold any kind of a shape.  It' delicious but I will never understand how anyone can form anything using 3 1/2 cups of flour!!

These are very good and I followed the recipe! No changes were necessary and my husband who doesn't care for Biscotti very much, loved these. This recipe is on my short list for easy dessert to have with coffee or tea.

Love this recipe! A wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon with a 10 year old grandchild. She carried home a loaf worth of biscotti cookies with an assortment of hot chocolate packets. We added toasted and chopped almonds. She was so proud! And, I had a smaller batch for two to enjoy.

To me there is nothing better with a cup of french press or espresso than a delicious Biscotti. This recipe exceeded my expectations! The basic dough is simple, slightly sweet and leaves plenty of room for additional flavors. I added raw peanuts this time and can't wait to drizzle chocolate. The cleanup was super easy which gave me more time to sample this awesome treat.

I just used this recipe to make biscotti for the first time and it came out awesome.  My son can't wait to bring it in to school to share with his class.  The only thing I changed was omitting the anise and used 1 tbs of  vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with chocolate and nuts.  As far as the stickiness of the dough, like others have said,  just keep your hands wet with water and it's not a problem handling it.  For a finishing touch I sprinkled them with powdered sugar. YUM!

Had never made biscotti and thought it would be tricky.  This was not hard at all.  I halved the recipe, but used 2 eggs, added slivered almonds, cherries and white chocolate bits.  It came out exactly like - biscotti!  Only much tastier and not as hard as store bought. They were a great hit - I will make them again and again and can't wait to try other variations.  I am a huge tea fan and these are fantastic with a cup of tea.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

This is one of my favorite biscotti recipes because it is so simple. I pep it up a bit with sliced almonds, chopped walnuts ,or pecans. I also use Fiori de Sicilia in place of vanilla. There are almost endless ingredients that can be added to such a basic recipe. If it tastes good and smells good, it can't hurt. Also, a hint for the cutting, use a pastry wheel or pizza cutter. No breakage.

A simple recipe that works very well.  It's basic so you can add all sorts of flavorings and other ingredients: nuts, chocolate chips, ... and it works.  Other flavor possibilities  include lemon or almond instead of anise.  A little more extract than is called for in the recipe helps the flavor.

Making biscotti for the first time, a friend who is a seasoned baker passed this recipe on to me and I loved it. I read the reviews and agree that the dough is sticky and for a long time it left me wondering what this is going to land up becoming but it settles down on, just needs a bit kneading. Also, I had no trouble with the stickiness, I didn't have to line with parchment paper or dust with flour, i just used aluminium foil on my oven tray and it didn't stick at all. The idea came from my friend too and it works. Tasty biscotti. I didn't have anise and used crushed fennel. They were YUM! I'm going to try this one again for sure. Thanks!

I hate going to all this effort for three eggs so I used six. The dough was impossible to work with. It was so hard I couldn't even mix it by hand nor my mixmaster.     I went ahead and tried to form rolls as best I could.   Baked and found the biscotti to be dry and no taste at all.   Thumps down on this one.   I didn't know that doubling would ruin the whole thing!!!!

This is my most favorite recipe I've always come back to. I leave out the anise and add all kinds of different things. It's so easy and a really easy recipe to get creative with. They come out crunchy and perfect for coffee...or not. My family devours them! Best biscotti recipe I've tried and I've tried many. It's a keeper for sure.

Wonderfully easy recipe to make biscotti tasted good and then drizzled them with confectionary  sugar with aniseed. I will make again but maybe add some lemon or orange rind in the biscotti mix.

I Love biscotti, as far as sweet treats its never too guilt inducing.  BUT...to make it even more guilt-free I replaced the flour with gluten free flour (Bob's Red Mill) and used natural stevia instead of sugar.  I doubled the extract (I used vanilla and added some fresh scraped vanilla bean) and added chopped pecans.  The texture is still great (a little less cake like than traditional flour would have rendered) and with it being toasted on each side I didn't think that it would matter.  And it doesn't :-) Very easy to throw together and enjoy in less than an hour!

Best Biscotti ever.
I love this recipe.  It is easy and fun to make and the taste is delicious.  If the recipe did not come out right it is because they might not have added enough flour but mine was perfect.  Finally a biscotti I can chew without losing a tooth.  Delic with coffee

Love these!  I was always afraid to make biscotti, but these are so easy!  I used almond extract because I didn't have anise and added a little extra for a stronger flavor. Perfect for coffee dipping :)

I've never made biscotti before so I was initially concerned that it may be a little difficult but wow, this recipe couldn't have been easier.  I followed the instructions exactly as they are listed here (using the anise extract rather than the oil) and they came out great.  Initially the dough was very very sticky so I refrigerated it for a bit before putting it on the sheet tray and that worked just fine.  After they cooled a bit I cut them, toasted them off a bit more per the instructions and dipped half in chocolate and white chocolate, delicious!

Just finished making this biscotti and it came out great!  All I did was substitute the anise for almond extract.
This is the first time I've ever made biscotti and I 'll make another batch real soon.

My first time making biscotti and it was a great success!  It is even easier in a standing mixer.  Subbed anise with almond extract and it was so delicious!  Not too sweet and not rock hard like most store bought biscotti.  I drizzled mine with some chocolate ganache and dipped it in coffee.  This is a great basic biscotti recipe and I will definitely be playing around with it :)

Great basic recipe. I made this exactly as instructed and it was very tasty. The second time I made it I added chocolate chips and used vanilla instead of anise extract. I also dipped in chocolate. I plan to make this again with some other variations.

I have tried many biscotti recipes but now I will stick to this recipes. I have been making this recipes 4 times now and I even don't have to look at the recipes because I have memories it. The first and second times I followed the recipe except I changed the anise oil for cinnamon powder because I didn't have it. The third time I used cocoa powder and the forth time I used poppy seed and orange powder. 
My husband love the orange flavour but I love it all...
Thank you so much jandee for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Great recipe.  I didn't have anise extract so used almond extract instead and the cookies turned out well.  I've been making a chocolate walnut biscotti for years but wanted to try a non-chocolate version.  This recipe is so simple that I wasn't expecting the cookies to turn out as well as they did.  My chocolate biscotti are crisper than these (maybe because they are made with butter instead of oil), but I may like the texture of these better - more crumbly, a bit easier on the teeth.  I bought some anise extract to try next time.

HELP!! I just put this together, added an extra egg and it is nothing like any Biscotti recipe I've seen...it is dry....worse than the crumbly you want pie dough to be before you add the water....like sand.  How do I fix this???

These were plain but not bad. I melted leftover chocolate morsels (w/ some chocolate hazelnut spread and a little oil) and spread over the top. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I used 1/2 Tbsp. almond and 1/2 Tbsp. vanilla. Very tasty!

I made this Biscotti the other day and it turned out wonderful. I used 1/2 Tbsp vanilla and 1/2 Tbsp almond extract. After they cooled I drizzled milk chocolate over the tops. I can't wait to try different variations with this recipe, this one is a keeper!!

I followed the recipe, but I had to add 2/4 cup more flour to shape it.  I also added 6oz mini chocolate chips. I baked them on parchment paper.  I sprayed my hands with Pam cooking spray in order to keep the dough from sticking to my hands while I shaped it in a rectangle. I baked at 365. The dough rose more than expected while cooking.  But it was fine. I cut them with a very sharp knife immediately after taking out of the oven.  I baked them at 350 on their sides, 10 minutes each side.  These were delicious!!!  I might add toffee pieces next time.

This is a keeper.   I used a combo of vanilla and almond extract instead of anise.   Added just a bit more flour, a couple tablespoonfuls.    Thanks for the recipe.

I can't believe how easy this recipe is. These biscotti are nice and not too hard like store bought, as one other reviewer noted. The holidays are coming up and I made batch after batch last year. THANK YOU for such a GREAT recipe. I've added almonds, dried cherries, diced dried apricots, amaretto, ground coffee, cocoa...you can vary on this for days. Thumbs way up for this one.

Perfect, simple biscotti! I used the pizza cutter as others suggested and also used 1 TBSP rosewater and 1 tsp cardamon instead of anise oil/extract.

I just made this, but something went awry. I am guessing that using large eggs was a mistake (should have used quail eggs, but my chicks only produce large and x-large...lol!).  The ingredients, once mixed, were the consistency of a very heavy cake batter or a runny cookie batter, not a heavy dough.  In fact, there would have been no way to have two "rolls" on one pan as they would have run together.  I added flour, for a total of 4 cups, which brought the batter to a state about as stiff as a regular cookie dough. I spooned the batter onto a large pizza pan in two piles and shaped them with a fork.  Remarkably, it turned out ok and the two shapes did not merge.  The pizza cutter idea another reviewer mentioned worked fantastic!  I was able to cut them straight out of the oven, flip the pieces on their sides and pop them right back in the oven to toast.  Like other reviewers I used almond extract and crushed almond.  When they were done, I coated one side with chocolate (some with milk choc & others with dark choc w/rasberry extract), then topped with crushed almonds.  All in all, they turned out fantastic... I was so worried they would not.  The whole process, including coating, was only about 45 mins from start to finish.  Next time I make these I will only use 2 large eggs.

Very good!  I made these after a different biscotti recipe (from a cookbook) left me disappointed.  I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, and substituted lemon extract for anise extract.  I also adjusted the baking times a bit for my temperamental oven.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I kept my hands moistened when shaping the dough.  These are very easy, simple biscotti and I hope to make them again!

A wonderful, elegant, easy and adaptable recipe. I do fennel seed and lemon rind for dinner parties, choc chip for kiddies and almond extract plus chopped almonds for variation.
To handle the sticky dough I split the dough into 4 sausages shaping them with damp hands onto 2 baking sheets. I also wash my hands between shaping each sausage.

Easy, fast, and tastes great! I followed other reviewer's advice and used 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp almond extract. I also added sliced almonds to the batter. I recommend checking your biscotti after 20 minutes after the first cooking since they tend to burn easily. 5 minutes on each side for the second cooking came out wonderfully! I also added a chocolate drizzle (1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/4 tsp shortening, microwaved at 30 second intervals until smooth). They look and taste fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!

great foundation biscotti recipe. agree with previous commenters that this wasn't "break your teeth" hard and was much lighter. the recipe was to yield 42 pieces but i ended up with less than 30 because most broke when slicing into individual cookies. (my slices were about 1/2 inch thick)

using this recipe as a foundation, i added:
+1 pinch of salt
+1 tbsp vanilla extract
+about 3/4c of toasted pine nute
+zest of 1 orange (i used a blood orange that was sitting in my fridge but a navel orange could work)
+once individual pieces were cooled, i dipped them 1/3 to 1/2 way in dark chocolate (but the cookie itself was tasty even w/o the chocolate. try nutella too!)

Came out perfect! Will add nuts and maybe even chocolate chips or something next time around...  I made small changes: Used Almond, vanilla and cinnamon flavoring instead of Anise Didn't divide the dough....prepared and baked the entire dough for 20 mins (didn't cool it), sliced and baked for 10 mins on each side.   TIP: I wore polyethylene disposable gloves to handle the sticky dough...super easy!!!

This is so easy. Turned out great exactly as written, except that I did add a splash of vanilla along with my almond extract. (couldn't find anise) I actually placed the logs of dough onto the greased cookie sheet and then pressed down, so no mess on counter or bread board. Gonna make another batch and add chocolate chips!

these are very good, easy to mix, roll, the dough is sticky but not hard to work with at all...I added a small package of sliced almonds in the dough, because that's how my mom always makes hers, I used this recipe instead of my moms because her recipe has 12 eggs in it, granted it makes more, but too many eggs!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

What a great biscotti recipe! Thank-you for sharing it!! :D  I made easily made this on a weeknight last week and am so happy I tried it. It was much easier than other biscotti recipes I've tried and seems easily adaptive to adding other ingredients.   Modifications I made to use ingredients on hand...  -I (reluctantly) substituted olive oil for vegetable oil. No specific taste detectable -I used amaretto instead of anise -I added a 1/2 c of coarsely chopped almonds  Delish!

Very good biscotti. Sadly, I burned the first log. I think my oven runs too hot. I lowered temp 10 degrees and cut the baking time. Second time-perfect. I cut back the anise extract a little bit and the flavor was perfect.  I think I will add nuts next time.

Very nice.  It really does need the whole tablespoon of extract, if you use anise.  I will try turning the oven down to 350 next time, though, as the times for baking were way off.

This biscotti was great- the only changes I made were making 1/3 of the recipe, using almond/vanilla instead of anise extract, and spreading chocolate over the tops. The biscotti came out perfectly textured, not too hard or soft. It had a good flavor, though it was pretty mild, but the recipe says that. Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent biscotti recipe and I have tried a few.  I changed the flavors by using orange extract & dried cranberries - turned out great.  I plan on using this for my basic recipe and trying new flavors.  Today almond extract & almonds and my daughter wants me to try adding cocoa & mini chips.  I used the other ingredients as listed and had no problems at all.  Thanks for recipe!

A great recipe and I HATE store bought biscotti.  I don't know how much I loved the anise flavoring, but that is just a personal preference.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a think about it.  I think it will be awesome with almond or maple extract!  Yum!  Thanks!

EXCELLENT!!!!Delicious.  very happy with results.  I added extra anise extract, glad I did.  They came out soft, which I really like.   Firm, but not hard, just the way I enjoy the biscotti.  Thank you for such a great recipe. Will be making with different flavors and will be making for gift giving. Thank you again. I mixed the wet ingredients in my KitchenAide mixer, then added the flour ingred.  So easy and so FAST.  Cecilia from California

This is so good and the dough is very easy to work with.  I did not use the anise extract but rather about 1/2 t. almond extract and 1 t. vanilla.  I also mixed in about 1/2 c. mini chocolate chips near the end of mixing.  Yum!

Oh my gosh, I love this recipe. It's so easy. The only hard part was flipping all the cookies to get both sides toasted. but even that wasn't that bad. I officially LOVE almond extract. I used that instead of anise extract. I'm so glad I did. These are wonderful. I'm not a coffee fan, so I dipped these in milk. YUM. Next time, I'm definitely drizzling these with white chocolate. That would be the icing on the...biscotti! :D

I'm sorry, I love Biscotti and decided to try some recipes this afternoon; I made this one and the Biscotti Toscani (also AR). Both were super simple to throw together but I was really worried about the amount of Anise Extract in this recipe -and I was right. My biscotti came our reeking like liquorice and tasted just as strong. I generally like liquorice but too much is too much! (in case you were wondering, the Biscotti Toscani recipe was amazing!)

This was my first time making Biscotti and the recipe, was clear, concise, and easy to follow. I substituted lemon flavoring and used lemon icing. It was a big hit at my company bake sale! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Remember the "wetness!"  This one tip will turn this recipe from "zero to hero." Wet your hands after you make the dough. It will make kneading and shaping the dough 1000 times easier. After I wet my hands, I was able to work with the dough without it getting stuck to my hands.  Overall, I was kinda underwhelmed, I guess. I mean they taste OK, but there's this really SLIGHT off-putting aftertaste to them. I can't put my finger on it, but the "finish" isn't quite right. Everything crunches well, it's nicely sweet, but then it gets kinda off-putting at the end. I believe I followed the recipe except I did do a few tweaks...  I also substituted 1/2 Tbsp. Almond Extract and 1/2 Tbsp. Vanilla Extract for the 1 Tbsp. of Anise. Finally, I also added a 1/2 cup of sliced almonds to the dough.  Just OK in my book. However, you should definitely Rock ON!

I was not as impressed with this as everyone else was.  The dough was so gooey, I almost threw it out because it was so difficult to work with.  I did manage to make one "loaf" (not 2, as recipe calls for).  I also thought the flavor was really weak, almost too much like flour.  If I were to do this again, I would add more extract and a dash of salt.  I will be trying a different recipe.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy to customize and the possibilities are endless.  I've added pecans and topped them with a maple glaze and I've also added dried chopped cherries and topped with white chocolate.  No matter what, these come out amazing.

Yummy, simple , perfect !!! I follwed the recipe with one exception I did not have anise so I used vanilla extract and a little lemon juice and used my microplane to add in lemon rind... They are amazing and can easily be converted to suit your tastes. To the reveiwer who mentioned cutting with a pizza cutter, THANK YOU it made slicing a breeze!!

These were fabulous....great basic biscotti recipe, and nice to add lots of variations to. And ummm Veggiess, don't be critical and say 'this is Rocco DiSpirito's recipe... if you look back at the reviews, JANDEE submitted this recipe in 2000...not sure Rocco had patented his recipe ten years ago.  Great reicpe JANDEE, and thanks for the submission.

so easy! thank you for this delicious, but simple recipe. i used crushed fennel seed and cloves with a touch of vanilla instead of anise extract in one loaf, and made a second batch with the same plus crushed almonds, dried cherries and figs. also, i substituted the last 1/4 cup of flour for almond meal. a versatile dessert option!

These are wonderful! I used almond extract and vanilla like one of  the other reviewers suggested. We ate ahlf the batch before they got their second baking! You will swear that the dough is to soft to work with, but if you oil your cookie sheet and put just a drop or two on your hands everything will be perfect. Enjoy!!!

this is my go-to recipe for biscotti for the holidays.  i start with the basic recipe and add in choc chips, nuts, raisins, whatever!  i sometimes dip half in melted choc or drizzle with choc and add sprinkles.  usually i will experiment with diff flavors: vanilla, anise, almond, orange....seriously there is nothing that can taste bad in this recipe in my opinion!  even a nice orange glaze is terrific!  when i tell people that i make biscotti they always ask if it's difficult because they seem to have a reputation for being diffifult to make....but not these!  definitely use a pizza cutter to cut them, best tip ever!

I don't use the anise extract. Instead I use almond extract and add about 1-2 tablespoons of anise seed. It is wonderful to see the seeds in the cookies and the almond flavor is wonderful. I melt semisweet baker's chocolate and dip one edge in after the cookies have completely cooled. They make a great gift.

VERY good! A must have every morning in my house! Instead of anise I used vanilla extract and lemon juice and added a little cinnamon. Also sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar before toasting. Yum!

There was nothing special about this biscotti at all. I found these bland- I used almond & vanilla extract. Butter adds flavor and crisp that oil just can replace. NO PROBS with the dough though. I fold in my flour & I actually ended up with too much flour. These also broke when I cut them- too cakey. I made these for my 1 yr old, so they will do. But for myself I would not make these.

This was my first attempt at biscotti, and it was so easy!  I used vanilla extract in place of the anise, and it was simple, sweet, and perfect with coffee!

The biscotti recipe wasnt that bad.  The dough was kind of crumbly, and so was the cookie.  I think it needs some salt as well, maybe about 1tsp of salt should do.

I have made three different biscotti recipes in two days!  This was by far the easiest to work with, and the best tasting!  I used vanilla instead of anise, and added semi sweet chocolate chips!  Perfect consistency and taste!  Thank you, Jandee.

This is an awesome recipe! It has the most delicious flavor and was crunchy and tender at the same time, next time I won't bake them as long the second time around so the don't brown so much, otherwise a phenomenal recipe. Thanks For Sharing!

This recipe was easy to follow and my biscotti turned out great!  The only change I did was to substitute 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsps almond for anise (I didn't have any anise) and I drizzled melted sweetened baker's chocolate on half of them.  My boyfriend loves chocolate and half of the biscotti is being sent to him on his ship.  My picky 11 year old gave it 2 thumbs up!

This did not turn out at all.  The only sub I made was to use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, but I don't imagine that would have turned the recipe into a crumbly mess that it was.  I had to add milk to it just to make it stick together enough that I could shape it into a log to bake, and even after baking, it still was not right.  Not wasting the almonds and chocolate on this recipe to dunk them in.  Sorry to the original recipe poster, but I will not try this recipe again.

The best! I made like 8 batched for Christmas & gave them as gifts. I took the basic recipe & made several variations like other reviews did, and I omitted the anise. I added toasted almonds, almond extract & chopped dried cherries to one batch & dipped them in chocolate. I also made a grand marnier and orange zest, chocolat dipped, that turned out amazing. The texture and flavor made this a smashing success for everyone! This is one recipe I will be making for years to come!!

Made a second batch - this time used butter (rather than sunflower oil) and also added candied cherries.  The dough was entirely different and was more stickly.  I again piled the dough on the cookie sheet and worked it into shape on the parchment, rather than trying to transfer it. ******************************************* I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception that I did not have anise so substituted vanilla.   I wanted to see what the basic dough recipe was like before experimenting with adding fruits, etc. so kept it plain.  I mixed mine in our KitchenAide mixer.   Much to my surprise, the dough came out almost like sand.  I poured two rows lengthwise onto my parchment covered cookie pan.  Then with dry hands kept packing and pressing the dough until it took shape and held together. I used a spatula along the sides to square the "crumby" edges up a bit. I baked it for the required time the first time and then lowered the oven to 250 and left the cut sides baking for about 20 minutes.   Then I turned the cut pieces over again and left them for another 20 minutes.  No overbrowning and quite dry and crunchy. A good basic recipe despite the worrisome start with the crumby sand-like dough.

This thing I like about this is that it is super simple. You can add a ton of ingredients and give it a bunch more flavor but for the work, its GREAT!   I did substitute the anise for vanilla though, I just dont stock anise

Very bland, not flavorful. IMO Vegetable oil just doesn't make it as good as butter.  I added anise seed and almonds but that didn't help.  Perhaps dipping them in chocolate could make a difference.

Amazing!!! I used almond extract instead of anise, these are awesome! I also added some crushed almonds to the batter. And topped them off with almond bark with sprinkles, some with almond bark and crushed almonds, and the others with drizzles of almond bark.

I have been using this recipe for a while and have had nothing but raves.  I bake the Biscotti once a week for my Church coffee and there are people who come just for the Biscotti! I also made it for a fundraiser in San Fransico last year and sold out in less than 5 minutes.  Easy to make and tastes great....what could be better!

It's good, but you cook them for less time than the recipe suggests.  I did 23 minutes, cut them, then another 5.  Anymore, they'd have been hard as a rock!  Recipe is a little plain, but still tasty.

i've never made biscotti before, but decided to give this recipe a try. i used cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in place of the anise flavoring, and i doubt i will do so again. next time, i'll use vanilla or almond flavoring. otherwise, this turned out great. i drizzled some with chocolate, and have had a great response to them! thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good basic recipe. And very easy using common ingredients! My dad is italian and always compares biscotti to his old nonna's, and i think these stood up pretty well.  The only problem I had was after cutting and returning them to the oven.. they browned very quickly, and on the bottoms as well, so i didnt have to flip them.

So I didn't make them exactly as I was supposed to. I put in zest from satsuma mandarins and used whole anise seeds instead of the extract. Then I dipped some in 70% dark chocolate, which I highly reccomend doing. "Best biscotti I've ever eaten" was the response from about half the people who tried them. Enough said.
One suggestion. I would bake them the second time for longer at a lower temperature. It will give less brown biscotti and allow you to get a more even crunch throughout.

Nice biscotti recipe even if you decide to under-toast it or not toast it at all. I think butter would add more flavor, but vegetable oil works fine. Very easy and quick to make.

This recipe is the best! The texture is wonderful. The first loaf got too dark on my cookie sheet (almost burned the bottom)after just the first baking. So I baked them on a baking stone and they turned out perfect. I didn't use anise, but on one batch used just vanilla and the other put 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg and 1/2 t vanilla! Loved the cinnamon ones! Drizzled them with melted white and milk chocolate chips and they are to die for! Everyone raves about them!!! Great base recipe that you could add whatever additional flavors or nuts to. Can't say enough!

I made this recipe with what I happened to have on hand in my new house....my supplies are limited.  I used peanut oil instead of regular vegetable oil and vanilla instead of anise extract.  I also made this as part of a Christmas gift for a diabetic uncle so used 3/4 cup splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar to lighten the sugar load a bit.  The other change I made was to add nestle mini chocolate chips.  I was really surprised at how well these turned out!  I baked at 350* and they came out light, crisp, and surprisingly tasty!  I am not generally a fan...at all...of sugar substitutes, but this recipe works really well with that partial substitution and I would absolutely be willing to do it again!  If I make this again I will go closer to the original recipe and may revise my rating to a 5 :)

The only change I made was substituting the anise extract with vanilla extract. A great tip that other reviewers mentioned is to shape the dough with slightly wet hands. This allows you to form a flattened log while preventing the dough from sticking to your hands. I baked the biscotti for 23 minutes, sliced it while hot with a serrated knife, and baked the slices for six minutes on each side. After I dipped the cookies in chocolate, they turned out fabulous: crunchy and flavorful. My kitchen smells amazing! Thank you for a wonderfully easy recipe that produces great results!

This is my first attempt at Biscotti. This recipe was very easy and delicious. I happen to like the Anise flavor and added a tablespoon of crushed anise seed. I think I could have even added more for more flavor. Second batch I used tablespoon of Almond Extract and 3/4 cup chopped almonds to change it up a bit. The flavor is nice however with the almonds the dough broke up a bit more while cooking and was more difficult to cut.

Delicious! I followed the recipe precisely, though I was concerned that the anise might be overwhelming, and I am not a fan of the flavor. However, these cookies are a great balance of flavors, light, not-too-sweet, crispy, and just enough anise to flavor it.

I've made many biscotti recipes.  These taste great.  I did have to add about 1/2 C. more flour, it was entirely too runny and sticky to form into logs.  I added the hard chocolate glaze from this site (as another reviewer suggested) and they are just delightful!

This is very good, and so very easy.  I do not like anise, but made this as the recipe stated, and the flavor was not overwhelming.  So if you are worried that 1 Tablespoon of extract is too much, it really is not.  I made a second batch w/ almond extract and chopped almonds, and it was also very good. I spread one side with dark chocolate, too.  Yummy!

This was a good recipe.  It was my first attempt to making Biscotti.  I think next time I might make a "glaze" for it or drizzle it with something.  It was good, but I felt like it was missing something.  It is definitely a recipe that you can "work" with!  Thanks for posting!

Very nice biscotti. While I would prefer more of a buttery taste, using oil extends the shelf life.  I made a double batch and added various combinations of sliced almonds, dried cranberries, and  chocolate chips.  I drizzled a chocolate glaze over some of them (1/4 cup butter and 5 oz  of bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate). That gives you a huge variety of flavors with little additional work.  

For those that think the dough is hard to work with, you just need to sprinkle a very small amount of flour on each log - it makes them much easier to handle.

These were great!  I too substituted vanilla extract because it is what I had on hand.  I coated the cooled biscotti with melted almond bark (baking aisle at Walmart).  What a great little gift to give to the neighbors or teachers.  You could even sprinkle any holiday sprinkles or chopped nuts on the almond bark to give it a festive look.

I have several biscotti recipes. I did not care for the anise in this recipe.  I might try making it with one tsp. rather than 1 tbsp. of anise.  I had to coat them with chocolate to eat them.  I would not make the recipe as written again.

This recipe was wonderful! Very very easy.  I added a little more than a 1/4 cup each of dried cherries and chopped pecans to half of this recipe.  And I left out the anise and added vanilla extract. I also melted some white chocolate to drizzle on top after taking them out of the oven. Also, I only baked them for 20  minutes the first time and then about 4 minutes on each side the second time, and they are golden brown and sufficiently crunchy! Thanks for the great recipe!

TO be honest as soon as I baked these, I wasn't very pleased with it. It was too sweet and not so good. Now that it is 2 days old, it tastes just right! I did not make any changes in the recipe except that I used vanilla essence instead of anise. I did not find the dough sticky to handle like some said and nor did I get 42 biscottis. Just around 30 or so. All in all it was good and I would be making it again inshaAllah with different flavors.

Perfect. It was my first attempt at biscotti though I have baked extensively, and I was worried when I saw how flat the baguettes were, but sliced they were larger than the usual biscotti you bought at extortionate prices, and tasted infinitely superior.

Perfect baked item to make up on a cold day. I had everything already here at home. They aren't fancy but they do the job. I mixed the recipe using my new Kitchen Aid which is easier and faster than by hand which is how I used to do biscotti.

I used almond extract instead of anise, but followed the recipe the rest of the way.  I loved these biscotti!  A friend of mine, "Frank" who owns an italian restaurant said, "You made good biscotti!"

i used dried blueberries and it was great!  like others, i also cut the rolls while they were still warm.  this just meant that I had to bake longer on each side.  a wonderful recipe that eveyrone loved!

This was the first time I made Biscotti's and this recipe was great. I did have to add about 1/3 more cup of flour to roll it and I added 3 teaspoons anise oil, but the flavor still was not to strong of a anise flavor. I also cut them when they came out of the oven, before they cooled to much. I will be experimenting with this recipe to try different flavors. They were easy to make. This will be my basic recipe for experimentation. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe. I am not Italian, I come from a German ancestory, but I have always wanted to make these, since I have gotten them at coffee shops. And my Mom's neighbor use to make Biscotti's for her, and since the neighbor has passed away and Mom does not get them from her neighbor any longer I thought I would make them for her. She thinks they are great.

Just tried making biscotti for the first time ever and these came out great - even though they were not easy to cut (lots of crumbs) - could that be because I added about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and few chopped almonds to the recipe? Should I do something next time like use less flour/add more oil ...? I would appreciate a tip on that since they were so yummy I plan on making them again!

Good, quick and easy. You can mix it up a bit by adding raisins, dried cranberries, or any other dried fruit.

Cinchy and very good.  Best Biscotti I've ever tasted.  I didn't have anise on hand so I used almond extract instead and they came out wonderful.  Make sure to take other reviewers advice and yet hands ever so slightly before rolling out dough.

Granted, this is the only biscotti recipe that I have tried, but I liked it.  I liked the limited number of ingredients, as it kept it simple.

I did make changes and consider this just a good base recipe.  Since I don't like anise, I substituted almond extract.  As it is also a very plain cookie, I drizzled melted chocolate on the finished biscotti.  It added a little something extra and made them look fabulous.

Great flavor and easy to make. I used vanilla flavor instead of anise and they taste great. Mixing in fruit or nuts would be a great addition.

Very good basic recipe to elaborate on. I added two teaspoons of molasses and another 1/3 cup of flour, and they came out tasting very similar to fortune cookies that are served at chinese restauraunts. Great flavor and was a hit with my friends!

EXCELLANT!!!  Just tried this recipe for the first.  Not crazy about anise, so I used some vanilla and almond extract and added chocolate chips.  Dough was a little sticky.  Once I floured my hands it was much easier to work with.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I'm not a huge fan of biscotti....but I have Italian friends who are.  They thought I did a fine job for a scottish girl.  I dipped some in chocolate and enjoyed them with coffee...they were good.

This recipe is wonderful. They are so easy to make. Since I did not have anise extract I used almond extract. My son could not believe I made these. I will make these often.

Tasted exactly like the recipe my mom-in-law gave me.  Very tasty.  Needed more flour to the dough since the dough gets very sticky and hard to handle.  Simple ingredients, though req'd many steps to get the end product, but well worth the effort, time, and energy.  Used half tbsp. of both vanilla and almond extracts.  Yummy.  Next time I will try to dip them in melted chocolate!

This is fast and easy! taste very nice.
I did a little adapting! I stopped by lehi mills
and picked up some cake flour.  they have a website. I used half powdered sugar and half cake flour, and  peppermint and butterscotch oil flavorings. For two varieties, melted choc. chips and butterscotch chips and dipped the cool cookies in them, and let them dry, oh so good!!!! try the cake flour and powdered sugar, It's almost a vanilla wafer. those are next.
