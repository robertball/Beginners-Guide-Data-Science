Awesome fudge!  I used french vanilla creamer, and omitted the orange peel and almonds.  AND CAUTION!!!!  when you add the boiling water it makes the sugar curl up and it spits back at you!  I almost got burned!! It also takes time and patients but it was worth it, I'll be making somem more today!

This fudge tastes great! I substituted 1/2 cup milk powder + 1 cup water for the 1 cup of coffee creamer. The fudge seems a little grainy after setting, but even conventional fudge always turns out grainy for me so I'm pretty sure the problem is me, not the recipe. :) I wasn't sure whether to use untoasted almonds or to toast them....went with untoasted, and as I said above it turned out lovely. I'm sure using toasted nuts would be fine too. 



I found this recipe when I was looking for a candy recipe that I could make without chocolate or cocoa powder. This fudge is great because it doesn't require fancy ingredients; just stuff I ordinarily have on hand. (The only iffy ingredient would be almonds, but I'm sure other nuts than almonds would work, e.g. peanuts, pecans, walnuts, etc, or just omitting nuts altogether.)
