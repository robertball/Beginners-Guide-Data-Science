This was very flavorful, I really liked it! I copied the seasoning exactly but used a chuck roast I cut into similar rectangular chunks. After prepping, I cooked it in a crockpot. I definitely loved the seasoning blend. I didn’t care for the way the peppers absorbed the mushroom flavor, but it didn’t affect the dish, just the flavor of the peppers themselves was a little off for me.

Great recipe! I love the flavor without all the MSG. I used bone in and it still turned out great!

another great recipe from chef john.  i tweaked two things - i added more mushrooms & used beef stock instead of chicken broth, everything else was per the recipe and it was delicious.  i don’t know what the dish should taste like but it doesn’t matter - this was fantastic. for those asking about the type of beef to use, i used short ribs. the beef was super tender and the gravy was wonderful.  so give it a go - it’s worth it!

I don't eat red meat, so I made it with chicken breast and only cooked it for about 30 minutes in the oven and served it over rice. It was fantastic, I'll definitely make it again. The only changes I made were the choice of protein and I used chopped jalapeños instead of peppercinis.

For my money, this is the only way to do boneless beef ribs. Since boneless beef ribs are not really ribs at all but from the shoulder area, they need to be done really low and slow.  Wonderful recipe.

Made according to recipe. But used instant pot. Cooked to spoon tender in 50 min. This recipe is a keeper. No question about it. The butter, herb, pepper flavors marry w the rich rib flavor. Served over simple mashed potatoes. It was beautiful and delish. Highly recommend!

I never buy ribs but they were on sale, so I bought them and was looking for a recipe. Glad I found this one! My ribs were fatty, so I didn't need the butter initially. The ribs produced plenty of fat for cooking the onions and mushrooms, but the shrooms absorbed so much that I did add a tablespoon of butter when I added the flour. I cooked in my slow cooker on Low for 6 hours. (This is a newer slow cooker whose Low is warmer than my old one's so YMMV.) I'll make again, but perhaps with (boneless) chuck stew beef so I get more meat.

Left out the peppers because I didn’t have any. I fixed it in my pressure cooker.  It was very good.  This is a keeper!

I have made this twice. Both times it came out perfect. my friends and family absolutely love this recipe! It's a bit time consuming and has a lot of ingredients but so worth the time to make.

3 stars only because it's too salty. I've seen rave reviews about this Ms Pot Roast, but never made it because it's all salty packets of stuff. I tried this because I thought it would not be so salty. Maybe when seasoning the meat I went a little overboard?? My advice is to be very sparing with the salt.  My advice to Chef John about trying the real deal recipe, don't.
