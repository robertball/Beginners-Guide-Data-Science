I thought these were a great side dish. I used 1/2 tbsp. of dried dill, since I didn't have fresh. I used a fresh lemon, as the recipe calls for, and I did not find the lemon flavor overpowering as others have. I thought it was just right. Also, I steamed rather than boiled them for 8-10 minutes to retain flavor and nutrients.

I added 2 tsp honey and thought it was even better that way!  The dill with the sweet taste was a great flavor combo.

These carrots are soooo delicious! I've finally found a great way to serve carrots. The lemon juice and dill gives them a great tang. I used dried dill weed and frozen crinkle cut carrots and it came out great.

Really good - I usually don't make carrots, but decided to try these.  I steamed the carrots (took about 20 mins) and I just added the butter, dried dill weed, and  lemon juice until I thought it tasted good.  Very easy to make - will make this again.

Great recipe.  I used frozen crinkle cut carrots and heated them in the microwave.  I used dried dill weed and left out the lemon juice since I didn't have any.  The carrots were delicous, even my vegetable picky husband liked them.

Can't go wrong with this recipe.  I did think the lemon was a little too strong.  Will make again.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe was very tastey, but mine took a lot longer than 10 min.'s to get soft while boiling.  Also the amount of dill shown I think is way too much, but if u just sprinkle on what u need, should be in good shape.  Thanks for the yummy new recipe!  My husband loooooves carrots!

This was a nice, fresh-tasting dish.  It took almost 30 minutes for the carrots to become tender, though.  I used fresh dill from my herb garden.

These were just ok for me. I used regular carrots and cut smaller than the baby carrots. Cooked longer than 10 minutes just to get them tender. Thanks for the recipe.

I always try to offer one raw veggie and one fresh cooked veggie in every meal, but at certain times of the year it's hard to come up with affordable options.  I've never been crazy about cooked carrots, but when I stumbled across this recipe I realized I had found a reliable, inexpensive year-round dish.  In the winter I don't have fresh dill so then I substitute dried dill; otherwise I follow the recipe exactly, and either way, this is a simple, tasty way to serve carrots.

Wonderful recipe.  I added ground ginger to the water while I boiled the carrots.  I also didn't have baby carrots on hand so I just cut up larde carrots.  Very, Very good, and easy to adjust for portion size and and ingredients

I used dried dill but next time I will skip the lemon juice.  DD likes 'almost' everything but even she didn't care for the lemon flavor.  Otherwise good recipe!

The lemon juice really adds a wonderfully fresh flavor to the carrots. Only minor changes I made: steam carrots instead of boil, use butter instead of margarine and dried dill in place of fresh.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I adore veggies with dill. I never use salt (don't think it needs it and my guests usually load up on it anyway). I usually just use regular carrots that I slice on an angle for little interest.

I used butter and dry dill and just a splash of lemon juice.  I also added a couple of squeezes from the honey bottle like another user and it was excellent.

Delicious way to eat carrots. I used a teaspoon of dried dill instead of fresh as that is what i had on hand. Other than that,followed the recipe as written(although, i found the carrots took about 20 min. to boil) Will make again for sure.

Excellent way to prepare carrots.  Like others have said - watch the amount of lemon juice.  Start off with much less - but it definitely plays an important role in the overall flavor.  I used dried dill to taste.  Very very yummy - and I usually avoid cooked carrots!

The carrots were good, however if you are going to make them definitely ease up on the lemon juice i would say maybe a teaspoon not a tablespoon of lemon. It was too strong for the sidedish. But the dill sauce was very good, I will make them again with less lemon.

No one in my home liked this recipe. To be fair we do not care for sweet foods unless it's dessert. Too sweet for our liking.

I made this with fresh sliced carrots. Since I was serving this dish just to toddlers, I omitted the dill because they are just pickey. Still, it was good and they ate them!

We made these on the grill, wrapped in a foil poach and they were great. We love dill so I added some extra of that. We will be making this over and over again.

LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.  QUICK, EASY AND AWSOME TASTE WITH THE DILL, LEMON AND BUTTER.  I DO LIKE TO SLOWLY COOK MY CARROTS IN LOW SODIUM CHICKEN BROTH, BUT THAT'S JUST ME.  GREAT RECIPIE, USE IT ALL THE TIME.

The taste of lemon and carrot is not very attractive to me....You could leave out the lemon and just use butter and it would be better. Maybe add a little steamed spinach, too.

Due to trying to eat healthier I made this with olive oil instead on butter.  Turned out wonderful.  I steamed the carrots.  Mixed 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp dried dill, a splash of lemon juice , and salt.  Then tossed it with the carrots.  Yummy

I thought this recipes was really great and simple. I've also added other vegetables to the carrots (such as cauliflower and brocoli) and they too go well in this dish.

This was easy and great!  I microwaved the carrots, used artificial lemon juice and dry dill because it's all I had, and used low fat butter substitute.  Even with all of that reduction in quality and flavor, I enjoyed them, my three year old said he loved them, and my husband, who has never eaten a carrot in front of me, finished his serving!  Thanks for something quick, easy, and tasty!  Next time, I'll use the fresher ingredients for a real treat.

I wanted to like this recipe but there was too much lemon and it felt like it was missing something. I'd make them again if I needed a quick side dish and had all of this on hand but I'd rather find something different to eat.

This dish was very good as is.  I didn't change a thing.  I'm used to having candied carrots, but this dish was so much healthier and tastier.  The fresh dill brought out the natural flavor of the carrots.  I will definitely make this again.

Definitely that slight difference that I was looking for in a carrot side dish recipe. I like that it was simple, not sweet, but still quite enjoyable. Dill would not have come to mind without seeing this recipe, but I am glad I tried it. My guests liked them as well.

Yum! I didn't measure, just sprinkled on some dill, squeezed half a fresh lemon, and added some honey. I also used real butter instead of margarine. Very tasty for Easter dinner.

My 3 year old loved these! For that reason alone I give it 5 stars, it's so hard to get kids to eat their vegetables. He hates raw carrots, but loved these,  Now if only I could find a way to get him  to eat spinach....Ahhhh if only.

I used lime juice instead of lemon; I just personally prefer lime to lemon in my recipes. I also used half a tablespoon of dried dill since I didn't have fresh. I used a little less than a pound of carrots, so I had plenty of sauce left over. I tossed the carrots and sauce with some whole wheat rotini. Delicious!

I am not a huge fan of cooked carrots so it's not my favorite dish, but I always get asked for the recipe. I will be making this for thanksgiving yet again because of requests. It does tend toward too lemony when I use lemon juuice from a bottle. All fresh ingredients make this turn out best.

A nice complimentary side dish to the roast chicken I made. I boiled the carrots in chicken stock and used dried dill instead of fresh. This was a fresh take on a dish I usually just boil and toss with butter.

Very delicious, and very easy.  I used butter instead of margarine, and slightly less dill since I only had dried.

SCORE! I was looking for a recipe for "salty carrots" for Easter, preferably something with dill. I found both. I know to taste before I add the lemon juice & to add it a bit at a time. Thanks!

Very good. I liked the flavor of the dill with the sweet carrots, they went well together. The lemon juice gave this a fresh bright taste, but I didn't care for it much. I doubled the dill in error, but it didn't make it unpleasant at all. Thanks, this was a nice side dish although hubby wouldn't even try it, his remark was "what did you do to my carrots?!"

Really good! It's always a challenge to get my husband to eat cooked carrots, and this seemed to work. I used 2 large carrots (peeled and chopped into chunks), 1 TBS margarine, around 3/4 tsp dried dill, and a few good shakes of salt and pepper. We were out of lemon, so I omitted it this time around. I steamed my carrots for around 8 minutes. It was very good and the perfect size for 2½ people. Thanks for sharing, CaliSpiceGirl!

I rated this a 4 because the dill with the carrots was really good.  The lemon was not.  For my second try, I just steamed the carrots, then tossed in the chopped dill and a teeny bit of butter.  It was great and VERY healthy!

The main flavour in this was lemon. Maybe I added a bit too much?  It really overpowered the delicate dill. I would make again but without the lemon.

I like the dill but there was way too much butter for me.  I like to add the butter a little bit at a time and do the same with the dill.  Not sure about the exact amounts - I just melt and sprinkle until it "feels right".  :)

What a great way to make carrots even better! I steamed mine, in order to keep in more of their nutrients. These were a great addition to our "Thanksgiving in March" dinner. I didn't think the lemon was overpowering at all, although I used fresh lemon, as the recipe stated. I find that lemon juice out of the bottle is sometimes TOO much in recipes that call for fresh juice, for some reason. Thanks for the post!

These were good and easy to prepare.  For my taste the lemon was a little overpowering.  When I make this again I'll reduce the lemon juice.

I omitted the lemon juice and it came out really good anyway. I had to cook the carrots a little bit longer to get them more tender. I would make this again

I cooked the carrots a little longer, and it turned out great.  I might add more lemon juice next time.  A great change from candied carrots!  Thank you for the recipe!

I used some real fat baby carrots for this dish. It was great. My hubby really enjoyed them and asked me to make them at least once a week.

Excellent side dish! I made some changes to reduce the calories and use the ingredients I already had......1 can carrots, 1/4 tsp dill, 1/4 tsp lemon pepper, and a few spritzes of no cal butter spray.  I just mixed it together and microwaved.

SO easy to make and the flavors are not overwhelmingly. It's a perfect side dish. May need a little extra flavor if you want it to kick.

I thought this was easy and a great side dish. If you're not a fan of dill, I don't recommend it. I also added a couple extra tablespoons of lemon juice, but that's just my preference.

A great balance with the dill, lemon & butter.  My 2 year old asked for more carrots TWICE.  Now that's a 5 star rating!!! :)

This was a great side dish. Usually i make the baby carrots with butter and brown sugar, this was different, lighter and a big hit!!! i used more dill then the recipe called for.

I really love this! I didn't think it was too lemony. I used more carrots than the recipe called for because I  had a lot of carrots on hand. I didn't increase the amount of some of the other ingredients and it tasted fine. I used dried dill weed because I had it on hand. Very nice!

These were wonderful!  I didn't have a lemon so used an orange instead (juice and some zest).  So simple and fresh.  Will definitely make again.  Whole 16 oz package took about 20 minutes of rapid boil.

Nice change from traditional green veggies and was able to use my fresh dill plant.  Also staying away from the brown sugar of other carrot recipes.  I will probably be a bit more liberal with the dill the next time I prepare.

I made these as a side dish with Christmas dinner and boy were they a hit! I don't use margarine so I made with butter and I only used 2 teaspoons of lemon juice instead of the 1 tablespoon they list on the recipe. Next time I will have to make double as these went so fast! Just delicious!!

Nice flavor profile. I cooked the carrots in chicken broth instead of water, but the additional ingredients really dress up the dish.

This recipe was pretty good but  definitely missing something  my husband and I cannot put our finger on.   I'm going to play around with it and see what I can come up with for us.  Anything is possible when you have a good base recipe and this is definitely on of those recipes.  Thank you for the share.

Was glad to see a more savory instead of sweet buttered carrots dish! Steamed instead of boiled, used dried dill in half the amount. Delish.

This was delicious! I only modified it slightly to my tastes. When I boiled the carrots, I added a couple slices of lemon to the water. I only used 1 tablespoon of real butter and added a smidge of raw honey. AMAZING! I was cooking for just me, so of course, I scaled it down to one serving.

I usually braise carrots -- but this, with the dill and lemon, is delicious.  I've made it two times, and had no leftovers.  Isn't that amazing!

Was not feeling this at all!  Sorry but I can't understand some of the good reviews.  I didn't think these were anything special at all. I made them as a side dish for thanksgiving. I don't know why but they seemed dry and unflavorful.  Will not make again.

I decided to make for the little kids for Thanksgiving as I don't think they all like the usual Green Bean Casserole that the adults love.  I made some today to test and liked how they turned out so have decided to double the batch so that everyone can have some and not just the kids.

I wasnt into this at all though my brother was. I dont think this recipe is everyones cup of tea so its not really versitile but when someone they like it alot. Strong flavors are used so my advice-even though i didn't like it-is to add the ingredients a little at a time to suit your particular tasts.

Very good!  I didn't even use fresh dill or fresh lemon juice and it turned out great!  I replaced the margarine with 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter and 1 Tbsp. olive oil.  I used 1 tsp. dried dill and bottled lemon juice.  I also added a little drizzle of honey, as other reviewers suggested.  What an excellent side dish!

Simple, wonderful dish to add a healthy aspect to your meal.  Although I did not measure the lemon juice I used, after adding the salt and pepper (to taste), I noticed the lemon flavor was not as strong...many above mention too much lemon, so maybe try balancing it with the salt and pepper.

I used dried dill, not fresh, and frozen baby carrots. I also added a teaspoon or two of honey, since I was making it for Rosh Hashana. I thought it was fine, nothing really special - I prefer bolder tastes - but my guests liked it and my husband felt it was very festive.

The carrots turned into mush and the flavour wasn't strong enough for my liking.  I might do a few revisions if I make them again.

I love dill and I loved these carrots! Of course, I used extra dill! I thought the lemon was a nice complement and didn't think it overpowered the dish. I steamed the carrots rather than boiled - just personal preference.

Loved this recipe.  I used the larger bag of baby carrots (2 lbs) and steamed them instead of boiling and I squeezed juice from a whole lemon.  It came out so good.  Just enough "bite" but the carrots still had thier sweetness too.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It is defintely a hit with my family.

So, so. I used real butter not marg. but I thought it made it heavy and greasy. I also used dried dill. I prob wont make again but if I did I would use 1/2 the marg or some sort of spread product not real butter. I steamed my carrots.I thought the dill and lemon juice were fine.

Much to my surprise - we really loved this! I usually detest cooked carrots, but accidentally bought a warehouse club sized bag of baby carrots when we already had one at home, so fixed this to use some carrots up - my hubby said "This should be one of our side dishes at Thanksgiving, it's that good." I steamed the carrots, melted the other ingredients in the microwave and simply tossed to coat. Serve quickly, as they cool off fast! Butter, dill and carrots...I never would have thought...!

I liked this a lot.  I was looking for a recipe for carrots that didn't drench them in sugar or butter, and this fit the bill.  I steamed them, and it took about 20 minutes, so I think it really depends on the size of the baby carrots you have.  I will make them again, but only for myself since bf didn't like them as much as just carrots with butter and salt.

I thought this recipe was great and I'm not even a big fan of carrots.  I steamed the carrots instead of boiling, and used dried dill instad of fresh. I thought the tang of dill and lemon was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the carrot. I will definately make them again.

Tasted good - nice and quick and easy too!  I think next time I'll leave out the lemon juice - my husband didn't like the flavor that it added.   I didn't mind it, though.

Pretty good! I wasn't sure I liked the different tastes at first but it really grows on you. Used a package of frozen carrots and ALOT less dill and lemon juice-about 1 tsp each instead of 1 tbsp...it just seemed like SO MUCH. Keep the rest of the measurements the same..saltiness seemed a little overpowering sometimes though. Overall, it was ok. I will probably make this again so my husband can try it too.

I agree with the other posters...leave out the lemon or use just a splash.  Otherwise good!  I used freeze dried dill instead of fresh.

Mmm, tangy and different!  I didn't have any baby carrots on hand, so I just diced up some whole ones, which may have worked to my benefit because they didn't take as long to cook.  I really enjoyed the lemon and dill combination, which was slightly tart, but went well with the sweet carrots.  I'll definitely make this one again, yum.

Yum! I was looking for a way to use up some fresh dill i had from earlier in the week without using potatoes (just didn't have any) and also for a recipe to  pair with the roast chicken I was making for dinner, what an insanely Simple but yummy combination, I never would have thought they would taste so fresh and yummy together! Thank You!

I don't really like carrots but my husband loves them. So, I made this recipe for him. I thought it was just OK but my husband LOVED them. He liked the tangy flavor of the lemon. He requests that I make it again!

A new way to serve carrots as a side dish. I used dried dill instead of fresh which may have improved my rating of this recipe. Also, for 2 servings I added another 1/8 tsp of salt. If your looking for something new as a side dish go ahead and give this a try.

Wow!!  This was amazing!  I never would think of putting dill on carrots.  I was a little weary, but from the other reviews I decided to go for it.  My husband who is not an avid Dill fan, loved them - the flavor was great not overpowering like I thought it might be.  I did use the dried dill becuse I didn't have any fresh - and it was great!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe, I will add this to my favorites list!  PS I made this with the Marinated Turkey Breast by Danielle and the Garlic Red Potatos by Laura - what a wonderful meal!  thanks again!!!!

This is a delicious combination of flavors. I usually add the lemon juice little by little, as the tartness can vary so much. This is, of course, even better made with real butter. Thanks!

This came out great. Following the advice of others, I too decreased the amount of lemon juice.

Really tasty! I thought that dill and carrots might be a little strange together, but the flavours actually go really well! I didn't use the lemon because I forgot untill I was serving this out on to the plates. Oops. Oh well, still wonderful!

This was a HIT!  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe says to, and it was delicious!  All three of my children liked it, which is rare.
