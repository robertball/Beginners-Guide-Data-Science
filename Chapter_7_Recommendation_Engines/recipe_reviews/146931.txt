I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  No changes are needed, it is the perfect combonation of flavors.  I guess if you wanted to you could change some of the fruits, but I suggest leaving the recipe the way it is.

Great recipe. Because I didnt have orange juice, I simply replaced it with apple juice. The Syrup was a delicious ingredient in the mix. Overall this recipe diserves 5 stars

This is great in a bowl with one scoop of sorbet and one scoop of vanilla ice cream. I plan to try this with a raspberry sauce on top next.

I loved it, and like things a little on the tart side so I added 1 tablespoon lemon juice. It was great!

Made it today and it is wonderful.  Fresh seasonal peaches and supermarket pineapple made a delicious sorbet with perfect texture.  Don't know how many sorbets I've tried that froze like bricks.  Try it, you'll like it!!!

I really like this.  It isn't overly sweet, but tastes very fresh.  I put all the ingredients in a blender rather than a food processor.
