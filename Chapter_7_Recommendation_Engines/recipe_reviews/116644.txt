Perfect for breakfast topped with butter and jelly.  I used Hellman's lite mayo and upped the sugar to 1 tsp.  These went great with a cup of tea.

In my cultural we make a fried biscuit and call it drop biscuits. It takes the shape of a donut hole yet not as sweet. This recipe is PERFECT for "drop biscuits". I made the dough (using non fat yogurt instead of mayo) then used a cookie scoop (to make VERY small drop biscuits) and dropped them in oil. Fried until brown. They came out perfectly! I am so glad to have found such a simple easy recipe to make "drop biscuits"!

Easy, tasty, and versatile.   I use these as shortcake for strawberry shortcake, as a breakfast muffin base, and as a dinner roll with homestyle meals.  (I only add a pinch of sugar when making them for dinner rolls)  they are GREAT with jam or honey.  My whole family loves them.    FYI..I SUBSTITUTE 1 EGG FOR THE MAYO.

I fixed these for breakfast this morning as I hadn't been to the store yet, and was out of about everything, including eggs and all-purpose flour.  Don't let the small amount of batter fool you -- they rise beautifully, and the recipe really will make 6.  They're on the plain side, so serve with jam, etc.

I cannot believe how easy this was. As soon as I read the recipe, I made a batch. I love that you can eat them as a savoury or sweet treat. I have sinced modified the recipe and used wholemeal self-raising flour, so it's both nutritious and delicious!

pretty good, but more like a biscuit then a roll. I combined i melted butter and honey and poured it over the rolls and placed them back in the oven for 2 minutes.

What a find.  My only substitution was soy milk.  They are so fluffy inside, like a biscuit, but crisp outside, like a dinner roll.  They're bisrolls!  I'm sure they would be delicious with additions of cheese and herbs or maybe an egg wash on the outside.

Needed some quick bread for dinner and made half a batch to try them out.  My toddler and my picky husband loved these!  I have made them 3 times in a couple of weeks and they are even good reheated.  They are more like a muffin, but still taste great.  That little bit of sugar makes all the difference!

Huge, doughy lumps of flavorless yuck. I even tried adding cheese and salt to them...it did not help at all. We are huge bread fans over here, but this flopped terribly. You need to put the yeast in or at least baking powder...at the very least a little salt or butter to boost the flavor.

These are a good, basic, EASY drop biscuit. They definitely need butter or jam if served by themselves, as they are on the bland end. I think I'll try them with more salt next time. I did try one batch with ground red pepper in the batter and on top, and those were very good!

The fact that I don't have to cut in any butter or beat an egg is amazing.  I agree that they are more of a biscuit, but who cares...they're delicious!!  I cut the recipe in half so I could just sample and they turned out great.  Did anyone else notice that they taste EXACTLY like KFC's biscuits?  Thanks for a great (and super easy) recipe!!

These are great! I made them for breakfast this morning b/c we were completely out of bread, and needed something bread-ish with which to feed my littles.  next time, i may add Craisins and orange peel to the dough, then they will be like scones in a muffin tin!
UPDATE:
Made again this morning for breakfast, only this time I used Bisquick instead of the self-rising flour, and then used half butter and half mayo for the mayonnaise part.  Added about a tsp of cinnamon and about 1/4 cup of raisins.....so basically I made cinnamon raisin biscuits.  After I took them out of the oven I put some vanilla frosting on top......DELISH!!! They tasted awesome!  Try it!

I would describe these as biscuits in a muffin tin. Its the easiest drop biscuit recipe I've used. I doubled the recipe and had plenty for Sunday morning breakfast.

These are fantastic! SO quick and easy, they taste great and use ingredients we always have in our house.  Really nice with garlic or onion powder.  Have also sprinkled them with different seeds.  Great last minute company rolls

These were just what I was looking for!  Quick and easy.  Next time I'm going to add garlic powder and perhaps some cheese.  I may try whole wheat flour as well. UPDATE: I made them with half whole wheat flour (I don't have self-rising flour so I follow the note on the recipe) and added oregano and garlic powder.  Fantastic!  A bit salty for us, but that is easily fixed.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good quick bun to go with your dinner. I found they were more like a biscuity-bun rather than a classic soft roll, but definitely worth a try!

WOW..Thanks Glenda, they were delicious and easy.  Definitely need to double the recipe, so good!!  I'd give it a 10 if I could.  My 12 year-old daughter's eyes popped out as she scarfed her third roll.

This was so easy to make. Like the other reviews, I did add just a little more baking powder and a tad more mayo. I have been looking for an easy roll/biscuit to make. Although it yielded 9(must be how small my muffin pans are. Thanks a lot.

Quite tasty for being so quick and easy!  Didn't have self-rising flour, so added 1.5t baking powder and 0.5t salt to flour.  Served plain, with cinnamon butter, and some mixed in herbs and parmesan cheese & a little popcorn cheese.  Kids liked first two, husband said "fantastic" to the latter.  Baked in mini muffin cups (made 24 total) in toaster oven.  Biscuity taste to them.  Oh, also used miracle whip vs. mayo.
