Slightly messy to eat (the refried beans & salsa mixture tend to drip from the taco shell), but delicious.  My husband enjoyed these, but he ended up making a "taco salad" by heaping the ingredients on top of crushed taco shells to minimize the messiness in eating these.  Perhaps using soft taco shells would be easier to handle.  Add sour cream to your ingredients list - I forgot to purchase some when I went shopping for the ingredients, and I think sour cream would be a nice topping to add. Will definitely make these again!

i have made these twice for my mother and she says they are the best things she's tasted or smelled in years. i used soft tacos and warmed the beans and salsa on the stove instead of in the oven.
