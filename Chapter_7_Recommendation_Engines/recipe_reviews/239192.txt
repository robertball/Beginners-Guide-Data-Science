Well, this may have not been the prettiest looking dish, but it was absolutely DELICIOUS! So simple to make, perfectly tender and FULL of flavor. My little guy loved this so much, he even had seconds! I served this with 'Garlic Broccoli' also from this site and brown rice...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow! Easy and so good! Did not change a thing except for low sodium soy sauce for the regular in the recipe.  A great way to cook cod, very flavourfull!

Wow, this was a HUGE hit with the whole family - even my 3 and 4y/o's (who are INCREDIBLY fussy when it comes to fish) were asking for seconds! The only changes I made were to add a little more water, and I also baked it in the oven since I was already roasting some broccoli to have as a side. I garnished the cod with fresh sliced green onion and some toasted sesame seeds - really pretty! Served it with the roasted brocc, and lo mein noodles tossed with a bit of sesame oil. Really awesome recipe. Thanks, AnnnCollin!

Alright flavor; I used the Chinese 5-spice and that small 3/4 tsp of red pepper flakes was certainly noticed. Pretty sure there's other cod recipes I'm going to like better so I'm moving on.

Very good but very salty. I'm going to try low sodium soy sauce next time.

Used low sodium soy but still could taste nothing but salt.   Cooked 8 minutes on heat and was tender but wonâ€™t be making again.

I would have given it less stars if I could.  The flavor doesn't cook into the cod, the cooking time is way too long to make tender flaky fish, and the reason they say to remove with slotted spoon is that you can't use the poaching liquid for a sauce, it is way too salty.  Tough, tasteless , salty.

It's definitely quick and easy but don't think all the flavors in the poaching liquid are really imparted into the fish.

Really simple and easy to make. Might try adding some brown sugar next time to balance the spice.

It was ok. The poaching mix had too much flavour; it obscured the taste of the fish. My only changes were that I cut the pepper flakes back to 1/2 tsp and used dried onion (forgot to buy fresh yesterday).

This was a pretty good recipe even though I messed it up horribly at first. FYI: Fish sauce is NOT a substitution for soy sauce. Holy salty! I guess that's why you should never mess with a recipe! Still, the taste was really good and the texture of the fish was perfect. Even my toddlers loved it. I'll definitely try it again, but with soy sauce next time!

This is not pretty when it's done. It's edible, but no one was asking for seconds.  I won't be making it again.

Great dish! Served it with couscous and peanut crusted broccoli.  Only thing I would do different next time is mince the ginger.  I got one of the "thin strips" portion of it on my fork and it was intense!  Avoided them for the rest of the meal and it was great.
