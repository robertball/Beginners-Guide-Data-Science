It was very easy to make. My daughter is learning to cook and she loved this recipe. We will make it again.

Every bit as delicious as claimed! The Queso Fresco gives a superb chew, and these cookies have a rich, buttery flavor.

Needed something else, maybe cinnamon sugar on the outside or some nutmeg, not sure. Texture was nice and fluffy, soft centered, I did make the recipe exactly the first time. WIll try again for sure.

Followed the recipe, no changes made nor needed. Just the right amount of sweetness and very buttery tasting without being greasy. Who would have guessed that Queso Fresco would work in such a recipe? Delicious!
