Here are the US measurements for this recipe for those who would like to try it: 1 lb (454 g) refrigerated tortellini, 8 oz pkg (250 g) Philadelphia cream cheese, 6 oz (175 g) ham ... the rest stays the same. Hope this helps! Good luck!

Pretty good!  I did however, use the new Philly Cooking Creme (Italian Cheese and Herb), because I couldn't find the herb & garlic cc.   Also subbed crumbled bacon for ham and halved the peas.  I used a 20oz package of tortellini and it was the perfect amount of sauce.
There are a lot of possibilities with this recipe!

Half the garlic and herb cream cheese recipie from this sit works well with this, just cut back on the garlic as one clove is a little overwhelming

If you are expecting Carbonara it is 2 stars.  If you just eat this untitled, it is pretty good.  I didn't use Peas due to no one likes them.

This was really good!  Thanks for the recipe.  Next time I'm going to cook my peas before I add them to my sauce.  Also I used two bags of tortellini and didn't double the sauce and there was still plenty of sauce.  Very good.  I will definitely pass this recipe along.

Dear Hubby made this and while we were thoroughly pleased (ME especially since I got a day off from cooking) 
The only thing I'd change about this recipe is the amount of peas.. 2 cups is an overwhelming amount for the amount of pasta.. otherwise... great dish.. would recommend/make again

i made this using stuff i had hanging out in the fridge. i prefer to use fettucini (not to big on tortellini), it was delicious, but just a little to creamy for me .. but that was easily fixed by adding some pasta water. salt is definitely needed. it was quick & easy, i would make it  again.

Good, but quite heavy. Serve light, healthy sides to balance it out. I wouldn't do bread with it, like I did tonight. Too heavy. veggies, fruit, or light salad.

I followed recipe exactly.  The kids loved it but hubby and I thought it lacked flavor and was too dry.

Family loved this dish but as others have mentioned the recipe is a mixture of metric and imperial.  You will need 1 lb of tortellini, 4 oz of herb and garlic cream cheese (they say 1/2 (250 gr which is 8 oz) cream cheese this equal 4 oz.), and 6 oz of ham.   Recipe is easy to come together.  Will be making again.

I really liked it. I had to adjust things due to what I had on hand....no garlic/herb cream cheese but I used plain and seasoned it- and I didn't have ham and substituted shrimp instead. It was quick and easy and totally unhealthy since I used skim milk and fat free cream cheese. Def needed salt n pepper though- I'm sure had I used ham it would have made a difference there.

I made this for my twelve little taste tester in daycare.  I threw my peas in last minuet with the  noodles  and then put my 8 oz of plain cream cheese in while the noodles and peas where still hot after I drained them then. I added the milk and Parmesan cheese in with noodles and cream cheese and peas. I put in 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp garlic salt as didn't have the flavored cream cheese.  I used bacon crumbles instead of ham to get that smoky flavor.  The daycare kids gave it a huge thumbs up.  This one is a keeper.  Super easy to make.  This one will definitely make the rotation!

YUM!!! I too used the Philadelphia COOKING cream cheese in Italian Cheese & Herb instead of the one suggested in the original recipe. I used the whole tub of the cooking cream cheese & added 1 cup of peas instead of 2. So simple & yummy. I served w/a side of bread. Will definitely make this again.
