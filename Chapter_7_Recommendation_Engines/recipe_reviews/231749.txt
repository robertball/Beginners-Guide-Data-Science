I tripled this recipe to make three smoothies. This smoothie was very good, lightly sweet and the perfect consistancy. Both the kids and I really enjoyed it. Next time, I want to try this with juice instead of milk.

Very creamy and smooth.  The consistency was too thin for us, so I did add some crushed ice to the blender to thicken a little.  You definitely taste the tang of the yogurt in this, but the fresh fruit flavors come through beautifully.

This is really good. I only had frozen berries, so I had so add a little extra milk, but the consistency was perfect. We added a little extra honey for our taste, maybe another teaspoon.

A 5-star rating with just a couple changes: I used frozen instead of fresh strawberries (because that's all I had on hand), substituted the milk for cranberry-raspberry juice and omitted the honey (I'm allergic plus I don't think you need it anyway). I also add some ice cubes to thicken it up because I like it thick. Great recipe though - thanks for sharing!

I put a little more than 1/2 a cup of milk, I used  1/2 a cup of greek strawberry yogurt and added 1/2 a cup of blackberries as well as 1/4 a cup of vanilla slim fast powder to get protein and to help me stay full! I also added some ice, I loved the honey and extract...

Fallowed the recipie, not enough vanilla and the honey stuck to the sides of the blender because the frozen fruit hardened it. Doubled the vanilla and added a little stevia to replace the stuck honey.

Strawberry Raspberry Smoothie Haiku: "5 stars from daughter, but only 3 stars from me. Let's make it a 4." Too thin, too sweet. (Frozen raspberries usually are already sweet, so the 1 TB of honey and the sugar in the vanilla yogurt was too much, in my opinion.) Also had to add ice b/c the consistency was like those pre-bottled grocery store smoothies, very watery and thin, so the ice thickened it up a bit. Pretty good though and certainly customizable to any taste and any fruit, or flavor of yogurt, that one has on hand; a nice way to start the morning (and wake up the late-sleeping husband by brrrrzzzzting the blender.)

Awesome recipe..... great for people of all ages to enjoy.... even the kids! I think it's an accomplishment to find something healthy and have a child like it!......... I ALWAYS put whipped cream on it to give it a little thickness.

This was very good!  I added ice to thicken it up a little and a cup of fresh spinach to sneak in some greens for my one year old.  We both really enjoyed this smoothie

Delicious! Since I used frozen raspberries and strawberries, it  came out very thick, so I added more milk to thin it out a bit. I normally skip additional sweetener, but it tasted much better with the honey added. Thanks, and I'm sure to make this again!

This recipe was pretty good... but it needs some more work. I omitted the honey and used fresh raspberries. I also added a little ice after my first blend because it was too runny. It needs more ice for sure to give it that real smoothie feel. I think it would also be great to add a banana to it. Glad I found a basic recipe and now I will just add my own twist to it.

I would recommend chilling it in the fridge for a little while before eating it so it's cold because there is no ice in the recipe. But the ratio of strawberries to raspberries is good!

I made it and it's the best! I'm diabetic so I switched ingredients for a cheaper and light recipe. I used 1 1/2 cups great value berry medley and I switched with great value light vanilla yogurt. the rest is the same. but use 3/4. cup milk, not 1/2 cup.

Good taste, but too sweet for my taste, and I like sweets!  Next time, I would omit the honey, and decrease the amount of raspberries.

Very refreshing, very appropriate for this first day of Spring! Between the tartness of the strawberries, raspberries, and the vanilla yogurt, I knew that 1 tbl of honey wasn't going to be enough. So I used 2 tbl instead of just the one. I also used frozen strawberries and rasberries and I omitted the vanilla extract. I also made it with all rasberries. I added some sugar to the rasberries because I have a major sweet tooth! I had to strain it to avoid all those pesky little seeds. Very yummy!

This smoothie was really tasty, although it was very tart. I recommend using vanilla yogurt instead of plain so you can just use that instead of vanilla extract.

4 Stars as listed but 5 with my changes. Used fresh raspberries cause I didn't have frozen and skipped the vanilla cause it turns out I was out. Substituted my kid's orange/pineapple/apple juice for the milk and other than being on the thinner side, the taste was phenomenal. I don't even think I needed the vanilla - between the orange juice and honey, this was plenty sweet.

This is very good. We did not have ice cubes though. I would have preferred this cold. It was a little bland, but VERY filling and healthy. My teenage daughter LOVES smoothies. We made this with plain nonfat Greek yogurt. My daughter said that she will definitely make this again!! Great recipe.

I followed the recipie but I used maple syrup instead of honey. However, the result was too sour so I suggest you use honey, or add more maple syrup.
