Beautiful cookie to look at!  Tasty as well, but I think the amount of white chocolate overwhelms the apricot.  Maybe next time I make these I'll cut the white chips back to 1 Cup total and up the apricot jam to 1 or 1.25 Cups.  One tip others have posted in other bar cookie recipes: when you're spreading the jam, don't spread it all the way to the edge of the pan/cookie - - - leave 1/4 inch or so from the edge.  This leaves a little room for the jam to spread without burning to the edge of the pan.

These are incredible!  I had trouble with the centers not baking.  Wait until they are refrigerated or frozen before cutting.

Delicious! Everyone at the gathering loved them! I only had one package of white chocolate chips which makes 1 1/2 cups. So I divided in half (3/4 cups each). Came out perfect. I also mixed the almonds with about 1 Tbsp milk, which gives them shine when baking, but other than that, I followed exactly. Great recipe, thanks!

This was spectacular. I used Raspberry Jam instead of apricot. It was easy to prepare and have a delicious texture. The only bad part was our host kept the leftovers and I had to make more when I got home.

Thanks for sharing! The bars were so sweet and tasty. I doubled the ingredients and used a 9x13 dish so that there would be enough for a party of 20 people, and it was all gone in minutes. Before I cut the bars, I waited until the dish completely cooled then I put it in the refrigerator for a 1hr and half and then began cutting. This helped keep it sharp, clean, and together and it made a great presentation!

Well, I did a bad job following the recipe. I got confused with the directons, and added everything together(not layering). It still turned out tasty, very sweet! I'd like to layer it next time, and use vanilla chips, instead of milk chocholate chips. I did that for my brothers, but in the end they wouldn't even try it. But the bright side was the neigbors, and my brother's gf loved it. And a whole group of roofers ate the rest in a couple minutes! Thanks, this was a good recipe! I will try it again sometime!

I've tried this original apricot version, but my favorite is to use raspberry jam instead and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract instead of vanilla (this is pretty much the exact same recipe as Tollhouse's Razz-ma-tazz bars on their website). I just think it has better flavor. Both versions are great, but they are VERY sweet and rich. If you're not a white chocolate person, stay away or reduce the amount.

This recipe was delicious! It was also very simple, didn't take too long, and used very few dishes, which is definitely a plus in my small kitchen. The only things I will do differently next time would be to use a bit more jam to balance out the white chocolate flavor and to refrigerate them before cutting.

These were amazing! I used raspberry instead of apricot jam because I'm not a huge fan of apricot and they turned out wonderfully. My fianc√©e and I couldn't get enough of them!

I tried it with the raspberry preserves and wasn't a big fan of the flavor but I think I'll try it again with the apricot, I think that will be much better.

good flavor but very bad presentation.  I cut them to serve and none of the bars held together.  I was very careful and followed directions to a T.

A quick addition to my previous review: some reviewers report trouble cutting them. Here's what works for me: refrigerate for at least an hour, then use your pizza cutter (the wheeled one) to cut. They will come out with clean lines and a beautiful presentation.
