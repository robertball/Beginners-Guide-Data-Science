I was going to give this four stars, but my kids wouldn't let me.  They really loved this.  However, the proportion of milk to biscuit mix is too high; use less milk, maybe 1/2 cup.  Also, I added chopped onions, green peppers, zucchini and mushrooms to the ground beef as it cooked.  It was a great way to sneak some veggies into my kids and added more flavor to the pie.  This will be a keeper.  Thanks, Rhonda!

This was very easy & quick to make.  My kids really liked it but I thought it needed more seasoning.  Next time I will add some veggies like the other review suggested and extra seasoning like garlic & more salt. Or maybe some canned tomatoes.

It was tasty and quick and easy to make.  I did however miss the lack of pasta.  I will try to modify it next time and instead of using the biscuit mix, I will try mixing in egg noodles.  I got that idea from the “pizza casserole” recipe.

This was pretty good. Next time I will double or triple the amount of italian seasoning.

I replaced the cottage cheese with skim ricotta, used venison instead of beef and also added the following veggies to the meat: onion, red bell pepper, zucchini, and garlic.  It didn't fit in a pie pan, but was FABULOUS!!!  I will make this again for sure!
