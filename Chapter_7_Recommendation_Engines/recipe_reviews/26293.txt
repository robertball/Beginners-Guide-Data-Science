Great Marinara!  I didn't have any Romano Cheese on hand, so instead just used more Parmesan.  Great flavor, and I like the chunky texture.  I am sure I will use this one over and over!  Thanks!

This was an interesting recipe.  I am not sure if the cheese really added that much though.  I added a little sugar to cut the acid.  I also used half a real onion rather than onion powder.  I then cooked meatballs in the sauce and before serving threw in a little fresh basil and parsley.  It was good and good reviews from the family.

This turned out really well.  I used it as a sauce for eggplant parmesan and it was simple but tasty.  I didn't add as much cheese and added about a tablespoon of sugar.

WARNING: YOU MUST BE AN OREGANO LOVER. I personally didnt care too much for it. This tasted like a bad jar sauce. My husband liked it - but thats not saying much. I think Im just not much of an oregano person. Since it had great reviews, i assume I'm part of the few who don't like an over seasoned sauce.

Fantastic sauce!  I added extra garlic, and since I didn't have crushed tomatoes on hand, I just used a can of diced tomatoes and mashed them a bit in the pot.  I eyeballed the measurements, and it turned out great!

This came out great.  I made this with a chicken cutlet recipe listed on this site.  I had to be careful, since my wife is Italian, and I could not make a better sauce then she does.  Only variation to the recipe was adding 2 1/2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning mix in place of the parsley and oregano and adding 1 tbs of sugar.

This was simple and good which was
what I wanted.  I did not have tomato
puree and Romano so used tomato sauce and Parmesan.  It's great when the
recipes call for items in the pantry.

Followed it to nearly the letter. The thing with this type of sauce is the longer it simmers the better. I let mine simmer for 4ish hours and my dinner guests just drooled. This will be added to the list of sauces I'll use again and again.

This wasn't bad, but didn't appeal to me any more than most sauces out of a jar. The parmesan left the sauce with a grainy texture. Adding sliced turkey sausage as an attempted improvement was a bad idea, as the flavors did not blend well.

Only thing I added was one chopped onion. I used organic crushed tomatoes and tomato puree. This was easy for me to throw together with on hand ingredients and my family liked it. Next time, I'd like to cut back a little on the oregano and use a little basil and a glug of red wine.

This was just ok in our opinion.  It was fast and easy to make though.  We had it with St. Lois Toasted Ravioli.

This is probably good for someone looking for a very basic, kid-friendly sauce. It is very much like jarred sauces I've had and very heavy on the oregano. In fact, you could probably use it on a pizza.

I didn't like it at all... it had waaaay too much oregano- it just overpowered it.  It definitely needs something else.  There are other sauce recipes that are just as simple that taste better (I think).

Love this sauce.  Parmesan adds right amount of saltiness and adjusting the garlic to our liking did not disrupt the balance.

A bit too much seasoning for my family's taste- added large can tomato sauce.  Sauted garlic and 2-3 tbl onion in evoo.  Added 1tbl sugar after cooking a bit.
Added additional cheese to taste. Perfect!

I didn't have tomato puree, so I took a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and put them in the blender. I also didn't have onion powder so I used garlic powder. It came out great! Thanks. :]

I loved your choice of tomato selection; I liked the texture and appearance it gives to the finished marinara sauce.  I used the DiNapoli Brand but still wanted to cut the acid taste a bit so I added ½ teaspoon of Splenda brown sugar. (Simply a personal taste preference.)  I prefer the caramel flavor of brown sugar over the plain sweet flavor of white sugar and the amount I used is not enough to sweeten the sauce but it does help cut the acid tang.  I also added 1 teaspoon of J.B. Jamison’s Beef Flavored Soup Base.  I don’t think it is a taste you will be able to pick out as being added to the recipe as it does not overpower the tomato base of the sauce.  But it does add another layer of flavor to the sauce without being overpowering.

Tried this recipe on Sunday for company.  Too much oregano!  I used this to make baked ziti.  Should it be 2 1/2 TEASPOONS oregano instead of tablespons?

I liked this because it was super easy to prepare and not icky-sweet like jarred marinara. I too didn't have Romano cheese and just added more Parmesan.

This is excellent sauce. It turned out thick and rich and like my husband pointed out, it would make great pizza sauce. I simmered this a couple of hours. I didn't have quite enough puree so I added in a half can of tomato paste I had in the refrigerator and some water to thin it out a little. I only had grated parmesan so that is all I used. This sauce is great! Thanks, I am definitely hanging on to this recipe.

Added basil as well as marjoram and a dash of sugar. Needed a quick sauce for my chicken parmesan and this fit the bill nicely.

My husband said this was "zesty".  I think it's bitter.  Not great but good enough to make again.  I did try adding 1 tsp. sugar it did help a little.  Maybe more sugar next time.

I was in a hurry to get dinner going for my family. I was out of sauce, so I just made this. While I only let it simmer for 20 mins., my family LOVED it. I'll definitely make it again.

Ugh. We didn't use cheese, since the kids can't have dairy, but I don't think that could have saved it. I have made much better sauces! I was just hoping this one would work out since I had the ingredients on hand for a last minute dinner and I forgot to save the recipe I used last time on this site.

My favorite find so far!!  I don't like onions, and the only way for me to use them is in a powder.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

For a SIMPLE sauce, it turned out great (I know that more complex recipes are tastier, though).  Overall taste, I'd give a 4.  The ease of the recipe I give a 5.  I was very pleased with this recipe!  I canned tomatoes from my garden last year.  I used whole tomatoes for half the sauce, and then pureed the other half (instead of using tomato puree, which I'm not really sure what that is).  I also used half of a small onion instead of the powder--chopped it up and sauteed it in the oil, then added the garlic.  I also added salt and pepper since the tomatoes I can have no seasoning.  It was really yummy.  My only complaint is that it was slightly runny--not as thick as I like, with a little excess water.  I'm sure that's my fault for not using "tomato puree" though, and instead just blending a jar of my canned (not cooked) tomatoes.

Delicious! The recipe is simple, and very tasty, my family loved it. I used dried basil rather than oregano. It goes great with the fast and friendly meatball recipe.

I loved the cheese in the sauce. It smelled wonderful while cooking. I can't wait for my husband to try it. I made it while he is still at work so I could see if I liked it before I served it for dinner. Thank you

A little hard to make, before you decide to use it for dinner 1 night, start cooking about an hour early. It does take 40 minutes to cook, and make sure to cover it. Will splatter everywhere.

This is a real tasty sauce where you can add mushrooms or hide vegetables and it’s so quick and easy.
I get compliments from vegetarian son and our grandchildren love it.

When I first made the sauce It was Delicious and really easy only thing I needed to use less oregano so I did exactly that.The second time I made it I put ground beef in it to turn it into a Bolognese sauce or something similar it tasted great both ways!

Wife likes this a lot.
I pretty much followed the mix except-I used 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, I also added a jar of  Prego alfredo sauce equal to the amount of tomatoe mix and added 1/2 a cup of sugar just before I put it to simmer. I also cooked some ground beef about 1.5 lbs and added the cooked beef to the sauce 10 minutes after I put the sauce to simmer. After I added the beef I turned up the heat until it was ready.
I also didnt use parmesan or that other cheese but used a handful of colby jack cheddar cheese.

What a great recipe! I used the sauce for pizza at a large dinner party everyone loved it and commented asking which brand I used, and they were suprised at the short cook time. I added some crushed red pepper just to spice it up some. Delicious!!!

I used this marinara sauce on Christmas Eve to serve with hot dagos and chicken parmesan. It was FABULOUS! My dad said it was the only sauce he has ever had that he didn't taste for two days after eating it. I did add just a tiny bit of Italian Seasoning and a little tiny bit of molasses (for a quadrupled recipe I used less than one tsp.)

This sauce is terrific. We used it for lasagna and though it is a thinner sauce than commercial sauces it did the job beautifully and very tastefully. It was delicious- even the children devoured it. We accidentally decreased the dry herbs by a bout half (my daughter was making it for us and misread the amount) but it was still plenty flavorful, we used tomato sauce for the puree and I used an immersion blender to thicken it and make it smooth. Delicious!
