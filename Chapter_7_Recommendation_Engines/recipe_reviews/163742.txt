This is a fantastic recipe!  The combinations are endless.  For fruit we use fresh local and in season (we've tried peaches, blueberries, nectarines, kiwi, and apricots) and for nuts we use what catches our fancy(pecans, walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts), and for cheese we've used blue, havarti, cheddar, swiss, jack, colby - all were great - we've never been disappointed.    Rarely does my husband request a salad for dinner - but since I discovered  this recipe last year he requests it on a regular basis now.  Tonite were having it with apple, walnut, blue cheese, dried cranberries, and thinned blue cheese dressing.

This was very good.  I left the skin on the apple...used a corer to core and divide it into wedges and then just chopped them.  I made the Tangy Poppy Seed Dressing on this site and it was  perfect with this salad.  Hubster loved it too.

I made this up because I had most of the ingredients on hand and had only remebered the dinner a few hours before.  I had never heard of a Fuji apple either. There were raves at the dinner party. All the flavours and colours were terrific.

Nice recipe that is versatile enough to accommodate a multitude of  taste buds.  I followed the recipe but added crisp bacon that was just begging to be used in something and thought "why not"?  Loved the mix of sweet and salty.  Definitely a winner Holly 214!

I was on my own for dinner last night, so I decided to have leftover mac & cheese and this salad.  It was quite good.  I used shredded cheddar, an unpeeled gala apple and I toasted my almonds (spread on cookie sheet, bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes or until fragrant).  Toasting nuts of any kind really enhances their flavor.  I didn’t toss this, I just layered the ingredients on a salad plate and drizzled with dressing, which was Poppy Seed Salad Dressing by Gay Nell Nicholas, also on this site.  All in all a nice flavor combination.

Once again a HIT with the tantalizing combination of flavors: the apple complements the red onion complements the cranberries complements the almonds...Well, you get the picture.  And the poppy seed dressing and spinach base pull it all together.  I even omitted the cheddar and it was still killer.

This has become a favorite! Stick to seven ingredients, but you don't have to use the ones listed. Mandarin orange sections, pecans, raisins, pineapple, etc.

Made this and the Poppy Seed Dressing I by Tina. Everyone seemed to enjoy the salad but I was not overly impressed myself. It tasted too much like mayo and I felt that it could have used more spinach.

This was so easy to make and was absolutely fantastic!  I sometimes forget what a great payoff I get when I put a little time into a salad. This is one of those salads - definitely one of the best I've made.  I left out the onion, but otherwise made it according to the recipe.  I will be making this again often!

We loved this.  I don't know what kind of apple I used, but left the apple skin on for color, and I subbed raisins for the dried cranberries. I made the poppy seed dressing for this.  Wonderful combination of colors and testures!

This was delicious. The red onions gave it a strong flavor. I used a Bartlett pear instead of an apple. Also, grated parmesan instead of cheddar, and added walnuts to the almonds.

I really enjoyed this salad.  I think the red onion was a little overpowering (and I love red onion in my salads) so I would cut back on the amount next time.  I also made my own poppy seed dressing (altered it a tad from Poppy Seed Dressing III from this site):  1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup milk, 1/3 cup white wine vinegar, 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp. sugar, 1 tbsp. poppy seeds (you'll have some leftover to refrigerate!)  I would also add some avocado next time (Yes, there will be a next time!)

Easy, unique and delicious salad.  I doubled the recipe for a cookout for 8 adults and had about one serving leftover.  Not as good the next day, but still pretty tasty!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Holly214!

Love this salad! I made it last night for a dinner party I attended....and it was a complete hit. I did leave out the almonds...didn't want to risk food allergy reactions. I will certainly be making this salad again in the very near future! Thanks Holly214, for sharing this yummy salad!

Have made this salad twice now. It is a great recipe that can lend itself to many combinations of fruit and cheese. I made it without the red onion the first time simply because I didn't have any, and it was still great. The 2nd time I added a handful of sunflower seeds and they added a nice salty crunch. Great recipe...thanks for sharing!

This salad is great - much better than I thought it would be. The only change I made was to make homemade poppyseed dressing. Thanks for an easy addition to many meals.

This is a fantastic salad! Loved the crunch the apples gave it. Great all around flavor combo. Next time I am going to use smoked gouda in place of the cheddar because we love that cheese with apples.

Delicious and simple to make.  I cut everything back and just made 2 salads for our dinner.  I used white cheddar cheese rather than yellow cheddar.  Thanks Holly214, for sharing your recipe.  It shall be used often this summer as I always have those ingredients on hand.

Turned out great.  Mixed spinach, apples, some onions, part cranberries with Poppy Seed Dressing III in a bag, till everything was evenly covered.  Plated and topped with grated cheddar, onions and some cranberries.  At the end, the lady took the whole salad bowl and sat down at the table and made sure there were no leftovers.

I used pecans instead of almonds and used orange poppyseed dressing.  It was great! The hit of the potluck.

Made it following the recipe exactly.  Delicious.   I followed suggestions of other reviewers the next time I made it, and added mandarin oranges and bacon.  Even better.  Third time, I added a big blob of fat-free yoghurt to the bottled dressing, and  we all liked the extra snap that added.

I stumbled upon this salad trying to use up my produce before I went grocery shopping.  I had granny smith apples, baby spinach and some romaine lettuce that needed used up.  I had a raisin medley and some dried cranberries, sweet Vidalia onions.  I had some sesame seeds and a bit of sharp Italian cheese and some colby/Monterey jack cheese..  I had some poppy seed dressing and some sweet onion dressing..  Very good with some grilled chicken.

This is a terrific salad! I have been asked for the recipe many times. One thing I changed was using Sargento Off-the-block shredded cheddar instead of slicing & dicing a block of cheese.
Everyone raves about the salad. Used Neuman's Own Poppy Seed Dressing. Delicioso!

I made this last night and it was the BEST salad I've ever had! I used swiss cheese as it was what I had on hand, however, next time I will definitely use cheddar which I'm sure will make it outstanding!!! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Wonderful combination of flavours.  Added some Arugula and used Cashews instead of Almonds and shredded Cheddar Cheese.

2) Used feta cheese. Yum.

Just made a triple batch last night and again had requests for the recipe. This salad is so simple, pretty and tasty.  I try to always have the ingredients on hand to whip it up. The only thing I do different is use shredded cheddar cheese instead of chunks. The best poppyseed dressing is the refrigerated brand  in the produce section.

Delicious! I didn't have cheddar on hand so I used Gruyere. Oh yeah, so good! I think there are many cheeses that might work well. I'll try it with sharp cheddar next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I loved this Fall salad and so did my husband, especially the combination of sweeet apples, salty cheese and crunchy almonds. As always I used what I had on hands : gala apple, my own apple cider vinaigrette and chopped sliced  cheddar cheese. Also, toasted the almonds.

I made this for a Bible Study lunch, and while I thought it was good, I didn't get any comments on it, hence the 4 stars.  I used a Golden Delicious apple with the skin on, and shredded cheddar cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It's certainly easy, and I agree with other reviewers that it's  versatile.

Loved this salad.  I used cashews instead of almonds because cashews are my favorite and used dried cherries instead of cranberries because that is what I had on hand.  Will be making this many times.

I made this for a bbq a few weeks ago and it was a hit! We had a vegan friend in attendance and I wanted to make sure she had something delicious and filling to eat. I feel like the apples and the poppyseed dressing are the stars, but with so many delicious, good for your flavors, the whole thing is wonderful. Even my fiance, who considers salads to be food for "little guys," raved about it and asked for seconds. I consider that, in and of itself, a WIN.

This was a great salad and came together quickly.   I used shredded cheddar cheese since that's what I had on hand.  I skipped the dried cranberries to keep the sugar content low and made a poppyseed dressing where I used half the sugar listed - didn't miss any of the extra sugar!  I had sliced strawberries for lunch and tossed them in at the end of my bowl - good addition.

Delicious and super easy. I had a little extra, so I took it to work the next day not expecting much but it retained crispness and the apple hadn't browned (gotta love Fujis!). I did sub green onion for red for our taste preference, and I forgot to get almonds at the store so left them off too. Thanks for the great recipe!

There is something about the way these ingredients mingle that I love! I decided to whip up ranch dressing instead of the poppy seed and I'm glad I did! It perfectly complimented the sweetness of the apple and cranberry. I served this salad with spicey salmon and rolls. It was easy and had a pretty presentation but the best part was the taste. Out of this world!

This salad is so great for a healthy and quick meal with very little clean up. I am an avid 'recipe follower,' but the seven ingredient element of this dish makes it easy to substitute other fruits/nuts/cheeses to make the perfect salad, no matter what you have on hand. My favorite rendition so far includes a dried fruit blend including blueberries, raspraspberries

I love this salad.  It can be a meal, or a side, or a great bring to a potluck.  All the flavors work together.   I learned how to blanch my own almonds - it is not hard at all.  I don't always use the blanched almonds, I just throw in what ever almond I have handy when I make it for home.  I made the poppy seed dressing recipe II on this website, and it was delicious!! My kids loved that I actually cubed the cheese vs using shred. The small cubed cheddar gave it the over the top mmm.. factor. Not to mention it is pretty!  All of the colors make it bright and cheery.  The ingredients are simple.  It's a winner in my book.

This is a sensational salad. I served it with twice baked cheese souffles after discovering this recipe last week & we have had it now with our dinner 4 times & with no complaints. It compliments chicken, bbq steak & sausages...everything.  Love love love everything about this delicious salad. The textures & flavours are amasing & it is so quick to make. I toast the almonds & leave the skin on for a slight twist - yummy.  Thank you so much.

Great salad!  The only changes/additions I made were to add grilled chicken, sliced strawberries and baby mixed greens.  I also omitted the cheese for the sake of calories.  This was a hit with my husband, my son and myself and I will be making it frequently.  You can't make a salad much easier than this one.  Thanks for sharing!

Very popular at our big family dinner.  A little something for everyone.  This was the first time I tried poppyseed dressing and it was excellent.

This was a hit at a Christmas gathering.  I followed the recipe "as is" and found it to have a delicious taste, plus it's easy!  This one goes in the "keepers."

Perfect combination of ingredients.  Cheddar is perfect with apples. I used a real sharp cheddar and my homemade Poppy Seed Dressing. The cranberries and red onions are a must.

This would also be good with candied walnuts instead of almonds, or pears and bleu cheese or gorgonzola instead of the apples and cheddar. Thanks for sharing, Holly214

I served this to my husband last night,with our grilled salmon. He thought it was delicious. I read the ingredient list quickly, but didn't write it down and thought it had a pear in it....When I reviewed the recipe, I realized my mistake,but thought what the heck...I added it too. I thought it added something! 
great recipe. Thanks

I loved this recipe and it was very easy to make.  Even my husband, who usually dislikes salads with lots of ingredients, loved it.  I used Maple Grove Farms of Vermont Fat Free Poppyseed Dressing.  It only has 35 cal/2 Tbsp.  It was more than satisfying.

Absolutely delicious! I used Honey Crisp apples instead of Fuji and Publix imported cheddar cheese. Also I made a homemade poppyseed dressing found on Allrecipes. It’s presently my favorite salad.

I made homemade poppyseed dressing (lots) and have made this salad several times.  I do not peel the apples, sometimes I add cut grapes, sometimes leave out the onion, use pecans instead of almonds.  Always good!!!

The flavors are good, but I thought there was way too much spinach to go with the other stuff.  I used half the spinach but wish I had cut it even more.  I topped this with thinly sliced roast beef and it made a very good salad.

This is such a great mixture of flavors and textures. I love it as is, but you could change it up to fit your tastes, if desired. I often just keep the ingredients on hand and estimate enough toppings for a single serving to go with dinner.

I would say this was an average type salad.  I think the dressing would make or break it.
