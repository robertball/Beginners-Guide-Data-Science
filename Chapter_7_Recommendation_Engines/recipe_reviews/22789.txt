this is my recipe and I must say that this site has dramatically changed it.  I use 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups dry wine, and about 3 tablespoons of garlic.  I also add a small bit of flour paste to thicken the sauce before serving over pasta.  Thanks.

This was a nice dish, but I felt that the sauce wouldn't reduce, so I think I'd add less wine next time.  Seems as though it needed something to thicken it up a bit.  Overall, my guests enjoyed it, but I don't think there will be a next time.  I also tried the champagne shrimp and pasta, and it was absolutely to die for.  I highly recommend trying this instead!  Thanks, anyway

Loved this recipe! Simple and delicious!  Only thing missing was GARLIC!  Can't have scampi without garlic! I used all the same ingredients, but changed the technique.  I melted the butter and sauteed the garlic about 2 minutes.  Then I added the wine and basil, simmering 15 minutes until wine had reduced.  Add shrimp, cook til pink.  Add pasta and toss all together.  Yummmmmmm....  Huge hit at my house!  Thanks!

This was horrible!  I took the suggestions of others and used 1-1/4
cups of wine, added garlic, italian seasoning etc.  Maybe it was the brand of wine that I used but I was sure dissapointed and it did not even smell good.

2 cups of wine is to much. I added extra garlic as well, which turned out great. Next time I might try adding some flour to thicken the sauce a little.

Wonderful quick recipe. I doctored it up a bit. I added a lot of garlic, used less wine, a little red pepper flakes and salt.  I added flour to thicken it up.  I used fettuccine, cooked then drained and added it to make a one pot meal.

I read Noelle's changes of her recipe and followed that exactly and it was still not what we were looking for. I'm the only one that ate it out of my family of four. I even added pepper and alot of parmesan cheese and it still just OK. Sorry, Noelle.

I made a few changes, and my family liked it just fine. It was not scampi as I remember it at a restaurant, but it certainly tasted fine. 

I decreased the wine to about 1 cup, added 4 cloves chopped fresh garlic, decreased butter to 1/4 cup and added 3 tbsp evoo. I also used fresh basil. I simmered it long enough to evaporate the alcohol from the wine, closer to 8 minutes. I also mixed in 1/2 tsp cornstarch to thicken and added salt and pepper to taste. Since my shrimp was pre-cooked and frozen, I added it at the end just long enough to heat it through. I also used brown rice pasta because I am gluten intolerant. 

All in all, it turned out fine and I would make it again.

Was quick, nice light taste, sure would taste good on a hot summer night.  A little to light and bland for my taste.

See reviews before cooking:  HALF the WINE! Add some garlic, dash of lemon juice, dash of salt and this recipe is perfect!

This dish was super quick and easy. I added garlic and flour to make it more of a thick sauce and topped with parmesan cheese. This will definitely be a frequent seafood meal.

I have to say I was shocked this recipe contained no garlic! We added 3 T and 2 T flour to thicken it up a bit. I also added some red pepper flakes-but very few. I didn't have the necessary wine and added a blush which was very apparent in the recipe. I'll give this 3 stars because I had to doctor it so much.

I was pretty dissapointed with this. The sauce was pretty runny over the pasta, even after trying to thicken it up with the flour and decreasing the wine to a cup and a quarter. The sauce didn't have a very good flavor, either. The food was edible, but I won't be making it again.

I am rating this recipe as made using the submitter's suggestions in her review. This is a quick and delicious meal. I used fresh basil instead of dry since I have a garden full of it at the moment. My first thought when I read the recipe was "It's missing garlic. It's not scampi." Why do the Allrecipes editors make drastic changes to submitted recipe? My tip: follow Noelle's directions in her review. They're spot on! Thanks, Noelle, for a great recipe!

I have to admit, I should have read the reviews. There is not much that can make this recipe taste good. After adding cheese, salt, pepper, red and green bell peppers and garlic....it was edible. I will probably not make it again.

this is a tough one to review after reading the submitter's comments.  That's because my only problem was there was too much white wine.  I should have noticed that 2 cups was a bit much, but my kids LOVED it and I enjoyed it also.  Again, just too much Wine and I added a little more basil.

I thought this was great!!  I LOVE easy recipes and this was EASY. I think you can get way more than 4 servings out of this, especially served with a salad and/or bread (a smaller serving will help cut the calories too). If you think it needs something extra, add it!  But sometimes less is more.  DELICIOUS!

This was sooo good!! I changed the recipe some. I used 1/4 c butter with 3 cloves of garlic. Eyeballed about 3/4 c wine in a skillet. Added basil and shrimps(diced) and the sauce did stick to the pasta and it was delicious. My husband loved it.

I gave this recipe a 5 stars!  Of course, I added a few things that I would like to share with others!  I did everything the same as Noelle mentioned in her review and recipe, plus I added a can of rotel tomatoes and chilis for a little zing!  Also, I used about a tbsp and a 1/2 of cornstarch mixed with a little water.  Mixed it all together and served.  Will be making again!

I must say that this hadn't turn out the way it sounded like! First of all this seemed to be really bitter although I've even lessen the amount of wine. And like some other reviews, I also think that lots of seasonings were still missing.  I added a little garlic and added one cup of cream and diced bacon. I even added 2 cups of shredded cheese which turned out to taste like CARBONARA Pasta. It wasn't too bad after all...

The dish was very easy and quick but it was lacking something. It needed a little garlic or lemon.  Also, two cups of wine was a bit much for a scampi sauce. I will enhance the recipe next time I make this dish.

Very good! I used a tblsp of minced garlic and half the butter. I also cooked some broccoli with the noodles and tossed it all together at the end. Sprinkled with some parm cheese and it was great.

this recipe was easy! I did 1 1/2 c wine and added the flour also but something was missing. More flavor was needed. But my date ate two plates so i would cook it again.

It was a huge hit.  I only used about 1 1/4 cups wine, added garlic,and flour to thicken the sauce.  I will definitely make again.  THANKS!!

I apologize to the contributor of this recipe but after cooking for  60 of my 76 years I sensed that there were at least a couple of ingredients missing from this recipe.  I added a minced clove of garlic  and I did add the full amount of (dry) wine but simmered it down to 1 cup then added one cup of heavy cream and brought it to a simmer for a few minutes, brought it all together and grated over the pasta about 2 or 3 tbs of a good parma.
Sorry for the one star but a redo will bring this famous dish to a five star!

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious! The only thing I added was a 1/2 cup of heavy cream after I poured some of the wine and butter sauce over the pasta.

Terrible recipe.  I was embarrassed to serve it. I am not a chef by any means so I followed the recipe to the T. 2 cups of wine is way too much. It was watery and flavorless. I read after the fact that the recipe was changed drastically.  Shame on allrecipe's part. Smh

I don't know if maybe I didn't do it correctly??...but I wasn't pleased with the outcome. I thought it was bland and a suggestion needs to be added to help either sauce. Also. Don't substitute penne noodles for spaghetti. Big mistake on my part.

Great recipe. I preferred the  original recipe with 1 1/4 cups of wine and 3 cloves of garlic. I used angel hair instead of spaghetti. Thank you for sharing Noelle C =D
