I really didn't care for this.  It was probably my fault since I didn't use the peanut butter...I just used strawberry jelly.  I think I'll just stick with regular PB&J sandwiches, but might give this a try with my youngins.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe for breakfast!  To make the batter more of a french toast flavor, add 2 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon.  Top with syrup!  Good Stuff!!

Super fun for the whole family to make and VERY yummy! I also added a splash of vanilla to the egg mixture (I use Suttons Bay double strength clear vanilla).  This will probably become a Saturday-morning-must-have-breakfast.

Really good once you get past the taste of warm peanut butter.  As a peanut butter freak, this will easily become a favorite of mine.  I added a splash of vanilla.  Next time I think I'll add some cinnamon too!  Good stuff :)

I really don't like french toast, however, peanut butter can make anything taste fantastic!! I added a little vanilla to the egg mixture and used raspberry jam. Try this with cream cheese and jelly too! Loved it!!!!

I just made this for my post-longrun breakfast and it was delicious!  I used natural peanut buter and wholewheat read (like I always do) and Smucker's blackberry preserves-- I think preserves work really ell here, because they're s thick and rich.  I scaled the recipe to make one servng, but I ended uphaving to use twicethe eggsand milk thattherecipe called for-- otherwis there wasn't enough to saturate the bread,so you may want to increase the amount there.  Also,a little cooking spray eliminates the need for butter-- trust me you won't miss it, the peanut butter makes this plenty rich as it is!
I loved it and plan to play around wit it-- maybe peanut butter an marshmallows-- or chocolate!!!
