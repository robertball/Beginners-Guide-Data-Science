This was fantastic!  I baked the shells almost done then filled and left on the counter until about 10 minutes before we were ready to eat them.  Popped in the over to heat filling and finish browning the shells and served right away.  I had one left over and just put it in a ziploc and left it at room temp overnight.  Put it in the over for about 5 min to reheat.

I made one without berries for a picky eater and it was also great.  I love berries but I would also like to try this with other fruit.  Because of the cinnamon, chopped apples would be delicious in place of the berries.

This was really great and easy.  I had to use the pastry sheets because the store had no shells.  I was being very lazy, so I cut the sheets into nine pieces each and basically made "raviolis' by putting one piece on bottom-adding ingredients-one piece on top and then pinched the edges together.  They were much better cold.  I shared them with the neighbors who loved them too!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Five stars for the great taste! I used frozen berries and that was a mistake that caused the pastry filling to be very runny, so I definitely don't recommend frozen berries in this recipe.  I used pastry sheets rather than shells and I didn't have turbinado sugar so I just sprinkled brown sugar and I think that worked quite well.

Great recipe!  I made it for Christmas dessert and everyone loved it.  I replaced the blackberries for blueberries and it was a hit.  Thank you!

These are wonderful.  I used a sheet of puff pastry instead of the shells, and cut into 12 pieces for tiny little pastries.  There is way too much filling when you do it this way, but it's very tasty so I'll use it as a fruit dip. I overfilled them a bit, but it all turned out just fine.  Since my rectangles were so small, one blackberry per pastry was about all I could get in there.  I folded over into little triangles.   I don't have turbinado sugar, which is made from sugar cane extract and is crystallized.  Brown sugar is an accepted substitute, though, so I used that.  They turned out just lovely--my only problem is going to be how to stop eating these things!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, tastes great, very pretty. You can't ask for much more. Followed the recipe and these were enjoyed by everyone that tried them. As the author recommends not to refrigerate, I agree that they should be eaten within a couple of hours of preparing them. I put the leftover tart in the fridge for my son to have when he came in from work. Although the cream was better chilled, the pastry was slightly tough and a little hard to eat. Still delicious though and eaten without any complaint! Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I'm not huge on cinnamon, neither is my fiance, but our friends absolutely loved these. I didn't have any turbinado sugar, but I'm not sure it would have made a huge difference. Next time I make these I'll omit the cinnamon, and use mascarpone instead of cream cheese. I have a feeling those would be wonderful.

I made this for hubby's work and everyone enjoyed. The only thing was that since I used 1/2 regular and 1/2 neufatchel cheese it seemed slightly runny. And I had to use frozen fruit cause supermarket didn't have any fresh. The extra liquid could have come from that too.

Made these yesterday, turned out great! My hubby said - it is "just like from a bakery" :)  I followed the recipe exactly. These were great the next day, didn't warm them, just kept them in the plastic container over night.

I used frozen blackberries with no problems, except they all fell off when serving.  I am going to make these again with cherries and I will fold them into the cheese mixture so that it all holds together better.  The turbinado sugar is a nice crunch.  Loved these.

So easy and delicious.  I used cherries instead since that's what I had.  I sliced the puff sheets into 9 pieces and put them into muffin cups to make my own shells.  Next time grease the tins.  I only needed 2 for me and DH so I put the filling in 2 as they finished baking.  Will definately make again and again.

I was looking for something to use my pastry shells that I accidentally bought instead of puff pastry SHEETS.  I found this and stumbled into an AWESOME dessert!  These are very tasty and quote one of the big time chefs, the Blackberry is the BERRY!  Great!  I did miscopy and left out the milk and sugar so I did on last bake (using brush, added milk and sprinkled with sugar).  REally good.

With blackberries I thought this was a bit "meh"...but throw a pitted and sliced apricot in there and it was completely wow!  I think it needed just a hint of tart to go with the sweet.

I used frozen blueberries because it was what I had.  I have been looking for a recipe like this for awhile so thank you!  Everyone loved them!  I also used regular puff pastry and rolled it out to 12'' then cut it into 6 rectangles and halfed those, I placed the two halves on top of each other and baked and they worked out great, they were easy to seperate and put back together, though probably not as pretty as the rectangle ones.  I also didn't have turbinado sugar, I couldn't find it at my grocers.  I sprinkled the tops with regular sugar and they turned out tasty anyway!  This is a great recipe, and I'll most definately be using again with a variety of fruit.

Talk about Delicious!! They were gobbled up within minutes! Used cool whip instead & brown sugar. All that I had available & divine
