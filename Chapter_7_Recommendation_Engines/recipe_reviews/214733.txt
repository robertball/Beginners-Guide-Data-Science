This was a great recipe that I will use again, the only thing I would change is that I used fresh parsley and I think it needed some seasoning salt on the fish before battering.

One star is pushing it on this one. I had nearly the same ingredients in a recipe that was broiled. And it's fantastic. I thought this would be too. Without having to turn on the broiler. NONE of the coating sticks. The fish has no flavor what so ever. Because it's all still in the skillet with the Panko chips. Do it in the broiler with the mayo/mustard and the spices in the mayo mustard and truly enjoy the fish.

My family and I loved this recipe! I noticed others had problems with getting the mustard/mayo coating to stick. What worked well for me was to rinse the fish with water and dry it with a paper towel first. The coating sticks much better that way. Great flavor!!

I like that this recipe doesn't use egg....I did not have any spicy brown mustard in the house, so I used Dijon instead...gave it a nice creamy texture.  It tasted wonderful.

The taste is definitely 5 stars, but like some of the other reviewers, I also had trouble getting the coating to stick to the fish. It's a bit tricky, and since others seem to agree, I know it's probably not just me. However...once I noticed it starting to come off, I just took a deep breath and made sure that I was VERY careful about how I flipped the fish afterward. As a result, most of the coating stuck. But if I had let myself get too easily flustered, I think it would've lost it all. The taste alone makes this one worth the effort, though.

This was quite good.  Used regular bread crumbs and lightly coated the fish in flour to which the seasonings had been added, before dipping in mustard/mayo mixture.

Very tasty!  Following others' advice, I added salt and pepper to both sides of the fillets before generously coating with the mayo/mustard mix. To address other reviewers' comments about the breading coming off, I pressed both sides of each fish fillet into a plate of the seasoned breadcrumbs to thoroughly cover the fish.  The key to not losing the breading is to NOT MOVE THE FISH once you have placed it into the pan.  Cook over a medium heat for the suggested four minutes on each side, and carefully turn and place on other side, again NOT MOVING THE FISH!  With added seasoning to the fish before coating, this is a winner, and I look forward to making it again.

This  simple little recipe was very tasty...a nice change of pace to your normal fried fish. I noticed that many people are having a problem with the breading sticking. Whenever I bread and fry anything I follow a few simple steps. First, dry off whatever you are frying. Next, I always dredge first in flour and then put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes. Next I dip it in whatever wet ingredient im using (usually egg), bread it in the crumbs and throw it back in the fridge for another 15 minutes and then finally fry it up. I learned this "fridge" method many years ago (dont remember from whom) and have used it ever since. My method obviously adds some extra time to your prep but I never have a problem with breading falling off in the pan.

I was also having the same issue with the coating sticking to the frying pan instead of the fish. I ended up trying to bake it in the oven instead. The coating stuck much better and still tastes great. 375 degrees for about 15-20 min. Don't overcook or the fish gets dried out. Goes great with sweet potato fries!

I am not a fish eater, but I like this recipe. One tip, rinse your fish, then pat dry THOROUGHLY. This will help the coating stick.

Turned out great, I used corn bread mix instead of Panko because that is what I had on hand, it tasted good.

This tilapia turned out delicious!! I love panko crusted tilapia, and the mustard and mao mixture gave it a nice flavor!! I used an all purpose seasoning blend with some garlic powder and paprika. I would make this dish again.

I did try this but used chicken instead, turned out pretty good. The coating did not stick well, I think I used too much oil. When I tried less oil it stuck better.

I thought this was quite good, I even reduced the mayo (used light) and added one egg white to reduce the calories.  Everyone ate it, even my 3 yr old (though I had to call it fish sticks and serve with ketchup).  I'm happy, though I may try baking it next time.

Add an egg to the mustard mixture, and don't move the fish once it is in the pan. Great for FISH TACOS and works well on a cast iron

I dried and seasoned the tilapia, like some of the reviewers suggested, and this came out great. I was also gentle with the flipping and didn't try moving during the sear. Not a strong mustard taste. Would make great fish fingers.

All the breading falls off. I read the reviews and pat them dry, then floured them. Followed precise instructions. I wanted something quick and easy. It was quick. If I ever try this again, I will bake it.

I had to substitute Dijon mustard for the brown spicy mustard because that was all I had, but I still thought this recipe was an excellent way to quickly cook some fish for dinner. And it was very tasty, too.

Very easy to prepare.  Simply delicious to eat.  Left me wanting more - I will definitely be making this again!  I heeded the warnings of other reviewers and was very careful in turning them.  As long as I took my time with a good size spatula and something else to support them I was able to keep everything intact.

This was very tasty recipe. I broiled the fish instead of frying it and it was moist and flavourful. This will be a regular on our dinner menu. How do I add "Darcey" or anyone else to my favourite cooks when I cannot see his/her profile to clck on?

It was so nice to have fish w/ a different flavor, in this case, mustard, which was predominant.  I usually prepare fish using some king of citrus, so the mustard was a very welcome change.   I found the mix of mayo/mustard to be an excellent way to get a thick panko coating.   Very easy recipe.  Might try using fish other than tillapia or even chicken breast, sliced or pounded so it cooks quickly when pan fried.

Turned out great! I did not have spicy mustard on hand so I used a mustard dipping sauce, it was perfect. I serviced it with asparagus baked with Parmesan cheese and a small baked potato.

Flavors were great... it was a little difficult to keep everything together though...I did pat the fish dry first which helped but flipping it/removing from the pan, a lot of the outer crispy layer came off. I will definitely try again though.

It was delicious, and the crunch of the panko crumbs is a great contrast to the soft fish.

I made this with frozen thin cut tilapia filets.  After thawing the fillets, the recipe was was easy to put together.  There was enough breading and mustard mayo mixture to do this again.  Probably because I used thin cut tilapia fillets.  I will make this one again!

The bones of this recipe are on point; and the Mac and cheese and Caesar salad paired nicely with this. Couple suggestions though. It was a bit on the bland side, so I added a touch of lemon to the mayo mixture and some bayou blast seasoning, lawry's salt, and grated Parmesan cheese to the panko cracker mix. A touch of flour helped the crust stick as well. What really made this a hit though was some homemade tartar sauce on the side. My stepson is crazy picky and he came back for thirds, so I'll definitely be making this again.

This was so good. My picky eater asked for seconds. For those who had trouble with the Panko falling off in the pan, make sure your oil is hot before you put your fish in that way the oil isn't absorbed which will make it fall off the fish.

I did not like this at all. I might have done something different but i couldn't tell you what. I had to add some Chile sauce, (sriracha) just to eat what I did. I hate leaving a bad review,especially one with such high reviews and all the stuff I like. Maybe if someone had some advice or something, I might try this again. 8(

very flavorful for tilapia. may want to let fish rest after breading and don't crowd in the pan to allow for flipping without all the breading coming off.

This was so good - best tilapia recipe we tried.  Because I was making oven french fries I baked the fish also.  I used the suggestion to dry the fish before coating.  This recipe took the boring out of Tilapia.

This was great!  My son has an egg allergy, so I used 1 Tbsp flaxseed + 3 Tbsp warm water (a common egg substitute) in place of the mayo, and Dijon in place of the brown mustard.  Didn't have any problem with the coating coming off, but I did make sure to not move the fish once in the pan as other reviewers mentioned.  I'll definitely make it again!!

Really moist and tender with a good flavor, not too strong. Breadcrumbs stuck on just fine, just make sure your fish is dried on a paper towel first.

This is probably my favorite way to eat Tilapia - though, I have to say, I did change something. Ugh, I know, reviewing when you change something is a cardinal sin. Anyway, in an effort to be healthy, I used all the same ingredients (but I switched to fat free mayo, though there's probably nothing healthy about that either) and I broiled it rather than frying. Delicious. Looking at another reviewer who washed her fish and dried it with a paper towel to get the coating to stick, I may try doing that and then frying, as I was finding that the coating didn't stick very well on my attempt.

The flavor of this was very good, however, I had the same problem with the breading not staying on.  I did everything that other reviewers suggested (making sure fish was dry, pressing the bread crumbs onto the fish, flipping it carefully), and I still had problems.  I'm not sure what else to try to fix the problem.

Looking at other reviews, I coated with flour first, and oven baked.  Very tasty!
