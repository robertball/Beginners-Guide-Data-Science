I tried this last night at dinner for family and friends. It got great reviews! Just keep in mind it takes 30 mins. or more to thicken up. So allow some time for that.

Made as written and it worked like a champ. I did add some crushed red chili flakes for some heat  to go with what I was serving it with.  This is a great base recipe and one I will use often.
