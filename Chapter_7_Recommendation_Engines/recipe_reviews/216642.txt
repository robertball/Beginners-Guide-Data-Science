I recognized this recipe as having a great start, but I also knew I’d be improvising quite a bit, adding some things to make it even more appealing to me. I particularly liked the bacon, garlic and tomato, so there was no way I was about to change that.  But I wanted something more complex, with a greater depth of flavor.  Also, the microwave cooking method didn’t appeal to me, so I cooked it completely on the stove-top.  And I figure the time I saved by not pulsing anything in the food processor and not bothering to puree any of the soup made up for any time lost by not microwaving.  So…I sautéed some diced bacon, added the directed “holy trinity” of onion, celery and carrot, the garlic, but I also added a jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced, and a chopped poblano pepper, although bell pepper would have worked fine too. (These measurements all based on the recipe scaled to 3 servings)  I wanted it a little meatier, so I added some cubed ham – chopped, cooked chicken would be another fine choice. I let that simmer awhile before adding the beans, some frozen corn and a handful of chopped, fresh cilantro. I used beef stock, a little extra than called for, in order to accommodate the extra vegetables. I served this with a little plotch of sour cream and some crispy tortilla strips.  I tasted this before supper for purposes of writing this review (tho’ I never taste when I cook – never have) and before you know it I had chowed down two bowls.  This stuff is awesome good.

This is an excellent recipe and everyone who's tried it loves it.  I made a few minor changes just using what I had on hand, nothing that would have had a huge impact on the end product. I made this soup without the bacon, and used ground chipotle powder and bottled crushed chili peppers instead of the hot pepper sauce.  I also threw in a can of corn...it just seemed to need that.  I also did the whole recipe on the stove top and skipped the fooling around with the microwave.  When I make it again I will probably still skip the bacon but will try adding a few drops of liquid smoke.  The soup was a HUGE hit!

I know some people will be irritated with my review, since I REALLY tinkered with this recipe big time! But... here goes! -I think a lot of flavor would be lost if I nuked everything, so I did this on the stove. Taking some comments from Naples review, I picked up a poblano to add to this...and what the heck, I thought, a small sweet potato would be yummy too! I added the poblano and potato with the mirepoix/holy trinity. Once the veg cooked down, I added beef stock (canned) and tomatoes... fresh from the farmers market which I diced. With all the extra veggies and since I was halving the recipe, I only added one can of black beans (which I put in after the tomatoes simmered a bit). Here's where it may get weird: I had about 1/2 cup refried beans leftover from a different recipe and stirred them in. You'd never guess they were in there... I swear, but it made for a thicker broth. I didn't puree anything. Let me tell you how awesome this turned out! :) If you've read this far, hopefully you'll give the recipe a shot, even if you find yourself tweaking it too! It's delish! Trust me when I tell you: it's fantastically delicious!

I made this as written except that I omitted carrots and cooked the whole thing in the crock pot.

This is a delicious recipe!  I, too, cooked everything on the stovetop and used broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I also will add more hot pepper sauce next time to give it a little more kick, but otherwise it was super yummy.  Served it with a corn bread recipe on this website.

I am the original author of this recipe and this was created for a quick meal. When I am not in a hurry, I cook the bacon in the microwave and pour the fat into a large stockpot to saute the veggies before adding the tomatoes, drained beans and broth. If I have enough time I cook the beans from dried. After simmering for about 45 minutes, I'll partially puree the pot of soup then add a can of diced tomatoes with red pepper and a can of drained beans. After that reheats, into the bowls topped with sour cream, crumbled bacon and sometimes shredded cheese.

Because we like spice, I added coriander, chipolte chili pepper and chili powder...sorry, but I did not measure.  I also put the crumbled bacon directly into the soup (which I did on the stovetop and did not process).  All in all, even before my additions, it's a great soup!

I thought it was okay.  I think the seasonings could use some tweaking.  The cumin was a bit overwhelming.

I would not puree the vegatables and black beans. Sometimes, chunky soup is delicous. I also put as many veggies (green pepper, purple onion, corn, carrots, celery, cilantro) as possible that would mix well with the beans and put the whole soup over a  bed of spinach.  I would definitely add more seasonings: oregano, black pepper, cayenne, hot sauce, cumin.  Plus, after browning the bacon, I just added all the ingredients into the bacon grease. Sooo yummy.

I did change a few things but very few.  First, I had dry beans on hand so I used those and instead of bacon, I used real bacon bits.  I also used a can of whole kernel corn and a can of rotel tomatoes but omitted the carrots.  All in all, it had a very good flavor and came together very easily.

No bacon on hand so I used Ham and added 1 tablespoon bacon grease as suggested in the receipe.  I used only whole black beans, none were mashed and added another 2 cups of beef bullion to make it soupier.  My beans were not canned beans and I used half of a 16 oz bag.  Very good and it was a hit with the family.  The cheese really jazzes it up!  (If your using a power pressure cooker to prepare the dry beans, I went 10 min on the bean setting with a natural pressure release.)
