PLEASE do yourself a favor and convert the "1 Tablespoon salt" to about half that or less. Same with the pepper. The recipe is completely inedible with that much salt.

Yummy! One tip: if you use Greek yogurt you don't have to drain first. It is available in almost every supermarket near the regular yogurt.

This is so good!  To make it creamier, I put the yogurt in a strainer lined with a paper towel (or coffee filter) to get rid of some of the whey for about an hour or two. I substitute balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice and zest. Use the large side of the grater for the cucumber or you will get a wet mush. I will use the whole cucumber. We always serve this with pork tenderloin or on our lamb burgers. It lasts several days. Efharisto(thank you)

My husband's cousin from Greece taught me how to make a Tzatziki sauce a lot like this recipe but without the dill.I make this sauce whenever I fix a pork tenderloin. I use the Souvlaki recipe by Abby Benner to marinade the tenderloin.I use Fage Fat-free yogurt which I buy at Trader Joe's. It's thick and doesn't need to be strained.

Awesome recipe. I didn't have zest on hand and it's fine! I used the juice from the plastic lemon. Perfect on sandwiches too! Help tips! 1. To make the dip less runny, strain the yogurt! This will leave you with 16oz, half the size the yogurt that you started with! That means you will need to halve all the other ingredients too so that it won't over power the yogurt taste. 2. Lessen the SALT. Add to taste. 3. Considering 16oz of yogurt, I would use 1 whole English cucumber seeded and CUBED to the size of a centimeter (elegance and crunch!). Your preference! 3. Tip to make the dip less runny, sprinkle a little salt on your cubed/grated cucumber and wrap it in a paper towel to soak up the cucumbers juice. 4. Add the cucumber to the dip when you're about to serve it. If it isn't added to the yogurt yet, keep the cucumber in a container with a fold paper towel to soak up excess moisture, keeping the cucumber crunchy.

This is a wonderful dip. Don't change it. Greek cooking doesn't call for feta cheese in everything, and never in this recipe. It's supposed to be mild and refreshing. Cooling. A similar dip is served in our favorite Greek restaurant. Do as others have suggested make the yogurt cheese (draining the yogurt) so that it will be better supported by the vegetables you use for dipping. Also is good with good sturdy crackers, but a standout with raw veggies.

I do not strain the yogurt because I like a slightly thinner tzatziki. Leaving it over night thickens it just enough.

Tasty, but I made the mistake of straining the yogurt as most reviewers suggested, but failed to cut back on salt and lemon.  If you strain the yogurt, you should cut back on the lemon zest and the salt by half.  It's amazing how much liquid strained out of the yogurt.  Very important step-- think it would have been runny otherwise.

This is a great, easy sauce.  The only changes I made was to reduce the salt to a teaspoon and increase to a whole cucumber. I followed the advice of reviewers and strained the yogurt. I strained nearly one cup of water out of the yogurt container!  If you do not have cheese cloth, a thin dishtowel or good quality paper towel will work. I grated the cucumber and strained the water from it too. In the end it was a perfect texture and gobbled up quickly by the family. We used as a dip ans well as a sauce for falafel and pita sandwiches. This dip keeps getting better as the days go by.

This tzatziki was a huge hit for my husbands birthday dinner. I served it with crisp pita and greek olives. Went wonderfully with my roasted lamb. I did learn though a little goes a long way.

I just made this dip, and it was really easy. I used half a container (32oz) Greek yogurt in case it didn't turn out well, so I wouldn't have a lot of waste. Then I added 2 small Persian cucumbers (what I had on hand). I reduced the lemon juice, dill, garlic and salt since I was only making half. I also skipped the olive oil. I didn't see what the point of adding it was, because it was smooth and creamy already and I didn't want to add the extra fat. I only gave 4 stars because I made so many alterations. It was so easy to make, I'm sure I'll be making it often!

I would suggest squeezing out or salting and placing the cukes in a colander as they will slowly 'thin' the dip as they leach out water.

A great tip I learned from Yiayia (Greek for Grandmother) while this sauce is being refrigerated put a piece of sliced bread on top while it cools in the refrigerator then remove before serving. This will draw out excess liquid rewarding you a wonderful rich creamy Tzatziki sauce

I used this recipie as the base, I omitted the lemon rind, cucumber rind and olive oil. I replaced the yogurt with sour cream thined it out with some milk, and used lemon juice in place of the rind. I chopped up cucumbers and put them in the sauce and added Goat Feta Cheese. The goat feta made the flavor so authentic.

Delish!  I didn't use any lemon zest, used dried dill, put the cucumbers through the Ninja chopper, soaked up water with paper towel and used Greek yogurt.  It saved me a lot of time and still tasted great.  Everyone commented on how good it was!

I have made this a few times, and everyone LOVES it.  Great w/ pitas, crackers, fresh veg, whatever.  I have learned, however, that your $2 is well spent to buy some really nice Greek style yogurt to start with.  I made it initially with lower priced plain yogurt - - I will not ever do that again!!!  The nice Greek style yogurt really makes better flavor and texture.
This recipe does make A LOT of sauce so I will probably cut it in half unless it's for a very large gathering.
The only adjustment I will do henceforth is reduce the salt a bit. Not so much for taste as for blood pressure ;-)
Thanks for posting this !!!!

Yum! Had to use double the ingredients (not the yogurt but everything else) for good flavor. Important to let it sit for a few hours before adding anything though to see where it is at flavor wise, then proceed with modifying.

I strained the yogurt and cucumber (after I squeezed it) but only for about 30 minutes because I was short on time. Really needs to sit in the fridge for about an hour or so. Didn't add the lemon zest and it was still great.

I made this to go with some naan bread that I had and it was wonderful! I did omit the garlic and the olive oil. I alo scaled the recipe back some by using a 4oz container of plain greek yogurt. Its best to use Greek yogurt, this way you don't have to strain the yougurt. I also added a bit of Greek seasoning to my mixture.

Another helpful tip is to use plain greek yogurt because it's thicker, and set a piece of bread on top of the Tzatziki before you cover and store it overnite.  This will create a less watery sauce.

This is easily the best tzatziki I've made. And I've tried several recipes from this site and others. Excellent recipe. The only change I would make is to leave out either the lemon juice or the lemon zest, because both, I felt, were a little too strong. That being said, this recipe replicates my favorite Greek restaurant's tzatziki. And I was beginning to think I'd never find a recipe so delicious! Love this!! Will make it again and again!

Very refreshing and tasty.  I added dried dill flakes to it as well, which was very good.  I used Greek yogurt.

Next time I will strain the liquid from the cucumber first to try that- as I have read many recipes call for it done that way.

Thank you for this very delicious recipe.

This is exactly what you are looking for if you are craving tzatziki.  I cut back a touch on the garlic - I hate that I can't tolerate garlic anymore!  Give this a whirl - you won't be sorry.

Ok this is really good.  It taste like restaurant style.  I was not able to add dill, it tasted good anyway.  For the summer this has no price as is lite and refreshing.  I would recommend to adjust the lemon to your taste and the salt too, but if you don't do anything to the recipe you would not be dissapointed.  I agree with others about the runny texture.  I solved using regular yogurt strained or greek yogurt and to allow the cucumber to drain the water .  To drain the cucumber you could add a little of salt and drain for half to an hour - don't forget to adjust salt in the recipe if you do this).

I did enjoy this recipe, but next time I will cut WAY back on the pepper.
The pepper flavor was too strong for me, and I had to go back and add more of everything else to balance it out.
I served this with pita bread and the "Summer Feta Burger with Cream Cheese Spread" burger patties from this site(in place of the cream cheese spread).
Our friends were fighting over the leftovers!

I made this as is except for the salt - I took JOHNN11102's advice and only added about half a teaspoon. I got RAVE reviews on this one - I had this with "Beef. It's What's for Dinner's" Mediterranean Beef Meatball Kabob and "araxjan's" Authentic Tabbouleh on lavash bread and pizza at a barbecue. It's a compliment when people ask for the recipe so I point them to this site!

LeeleeCooks wasn't lying when she said it  "only gets better with time".  It was great the moment I made it but now that it's been 2 days later I must say the taste really improved.  I'm impressed.  I've tried making another version of this sauce in the past but didn't have ANY luck due to my lack of knowledge w/ draining yogurt.  I was timid with making this again so rather than buying plain yogurt I went ahead and bought a Greek Yogurt Spread (I forget the brand).  No draining needed and it was thick!  We used this tonight for dipping fried steak fingers and we plan to incorporate the rest into a couple more meals over the week.   Love it love it, thanks Leelee.

This is a great recipe especially if you are looking for things to use your garden cucumbers in. I used regular cucumbers and it still turned out great. I do believe it was a little runny but I heard no complaints, so five stars from me.

Go with less cucumber and add in if necessary after tasting.  The first time I made this I bought a small cucumber thinking I could use the whole thing - bad idea.  We ended up throwing most of it away.

I have used this as a dip with pita chips and as a sauce on top of a grilled veggie sandwich.  Perfect either way.  Using Greek yogurt and chopping,salting and draining the cucumber really worked well.

Don't buy greek yogurt, strain plain yogurt through coffee filters..its cheaper.  Also strain the grated cucumber or squeeze out the liquid, doesn't need olive oil, I use a lot more garlice pressed or grated.  Make in the morning for dinner that night.

Got rave reviews and had one friend literally just eating it with a spoon. LOL  I found the Greek yogurt in our health food store without a problem.  My vegetarian friend said it is a MUST for this dish.  Thanks for sharing.

I used Greek yogurt so no draining required. I just increased the garlic to 2 cloves, used a whole cucumber (drained it couple hours) and eliminated the zest. Only 1/4 tsp salt and pepper. Perfect!

Although i do not eat tzatziki, i made it for my spouse. Instead of low fat i used 3% Greek yogurt. I also seeded the cucumber, diced it very fine, and put it in a colander with the salt. After 1 hour i rinsed it under cold water and dried it on paper towels. She had it with Greek ground meat kabobs and pitas. She said it was the best she has ever tasted, bar none. Mike

Great recipe, but is the salt quantity a typo? I used less than 1 tsp. I took some reviewers' advice and squeezed moisture from the shredded cuke; really glad I did. Will use again.

Yummy! Used 16 oz. of Greek yogurt and halved the recipe as follows: 
1 tsp. minced garlic, 3/4 Tbs. dried dill, 1 tsp. lemon Juice, 1 tsp. lemon zest, 1/2 tsp. salt/pepper, 1/2 Tbs. Olive oil, 
then 1/2 English cucumber shredded on the large grater and 1/2 cucumber diced fine. Salt cucumber in the strainer and let it sit for several minutes to bring out the water then dab with paper towels.

This is the best!  I use part of the salt(sea salt) to sprinkle over the grated cucumber to release the water so the  sauce will be more creamy. I put the cucumber in a strainer, lined with paper towel, then put a weight on it to press the water out. Certainly is a hit with all our guests. Serve it over baked potatoes and listen to the " mmmmm." Bed and Breakfast owner in Hanover, Ontario,Canada

Good! Exactly what I was looking for. I'm not positive that the olive oil is necessary. I used Greek yogurt and cut the recipe by at least a half, adding the ingredients to taste but more or less in the proportions recommended. Thanks!

still not as good as the tzatziki I bought at a local deli...but it's getting there. it had a little bite to it - too sour rather than creamy i thought. Maybe sour cream rather than tangy yogurt? less lemon? i'll keep experimenting.

This came out really great. I used greek yogurt so there was no need to strain. Also, i grated the cucumber onto a paper towel and dried it off a bit before mixing it in to get rid of some of the moisture. I also used much more dill than 3 tablespoons, and it was delicious.

I've been wanting to make Tzatziki for awhile now and I think this was a good recipe to start with. I added an extra cucumber because I like the thicker consistency and texture. I also added more garlic and lemon juice because they are flavors I love. Yummy and easy to make. Thank you.

This recipe had exactly the taste I was expecting.  I also used the non-fat greek style yogurt so I didn't have to do any straining.  I found the 3 tbl spns of Dill to be a little too much (changed the texture of the Tzatziki Sauce), next time I will try 1 tbl spn and add more if desired.

This is a almost perfect recipe, you must strain the yogurt, and cut down on the salt a bit, creamier is always better for dipping, so keep that in mind! Otherwise, this is a fantastic recipe, very similar to my families! ;)

This IS the real deal!! I only made a 1/3 of this recipe and doubled the called for garlic.  This was the best Tzatziki!  Thank you!! I used lowfat yogurt and let it drain with a coffee filter for about an hour. SO good!

We found this a bit too lemony for a dip.  I think it would be nice served with fish, however, given the lemon flavor.  I agree with another reviewer who noted that the salt and pepper are a bit too heavy.

Great. A really authentic flavour and virtually calorie free when made with fat free yoghurt. Made a massive quantity Even though I only made a third.

It was a little bland so I increased the garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil, and fresh dill. It was way too salty so I’d def reduce the salt considerably next time. It was ok but there was something missing.

Great recipe! I used Greek yogurt so I wouldn't have to strain it and it worked out great. I would just cut down the salt next time. A full tablespoon is overpowering.

LeeleeCooks I do applaud you!This tastes very authentic! There is a wonderful community of Greeks near where I live. They own quite a few businesses and sell a similar Ztatziki to yours.

I love this.  I didn’t have fresh dill but had some I dehydrated last year...it work just fine.  The salt needs cut back, a lot. I use 1/2 - 1 teaspoon (same for the pepper) and it is so much better. Overall a great recipe.

Hmm, kinda hard to get past the sweetness...didn’t realize I bought a Vanilla flavoured Greek yogurt until I tasted the creation. Oops! Wipl never make that mistake again. Perhaps my kids will really like it now.

As some suggested, I used low fat plain greek yogurt. I also salted the grated cucumber and then soaked up the excess liquid with paper towels. Used MUCH less salt. It was great!

Very good! I did think it was too peppery, but otherwise, it's a great recipe. I didn't use the highest-quality pepper, so that may have been the issue. I used about 1.5 tablespoons of lemon zest rather than the full 2 tbsp, but otherwise, followed the recipe as is.

I paired this with a Greek lemon chicken and potato bake from the site.

Very good but in my opinion way too much lemon and not enough garlic. I say do half the lemon twice the garlic and you’re good to go! I used plain Greek yogurt nice consistency to it. Will definitely make again once I dilute mine with ingredients to get the insane lemon taste out

Great recipe! I reduced the amount of S&P, added a dash of hot sauce to round out the flavor (that is probably not Greek). Letting the flavors marry right now, can’t wait to serve it on burgers tonight!

With a few adjustments this was well liked. Salt cucumber in a strainer & let sit for awhile to remove water. We used lime juice. 1/2 recipe is enough for 4 servings. Also peel cucumber & remove seeds, then grate it.

Made as written, but using 1/2 tbsb salt & pepper, as suggested. 

Close as I’ll ever come to the Greek restaurant in my hometown.

Deducting a star because I made changes to it. Original recipe has WAY too much salt, I would reduce it to maybe 1 teaspoon. I also reduced the dill a bit for personal preference. Overall pretty good.

I made this with falafel and pita and it turned out perfectly! This will be the only tzatziki recipe I make from now on (and always with Greek yogurt)!

Whoa.  WAYYYYYY too salty.  I should've trusted my gut and used half the salt and slowly added more... Definitely cut back the salt, people.

Awesome recipe.  For years we have paid a small fortune to purchase some from our favorite restaurant.  Now I will just make it at home.  I used plain 2% Greek yogurt, which skips the step of straining and removing excess liquid from plain yogurt.   After grating the cucumber on the larger edge of the grater, I squeezed paper towels on top of the cucumber to remove excess liquid and the end result was nice thick tzatziki.  I also used less salt.  Less is more and you can always add more, but you can’t take some out once you’ve used too much.  I did not have too much time to let it sit for 8 hours, but ate it within a couple of hours of making it.  It was ALMOST as good as it was the next day, so if you don’t have time to let it sit, don’t worry too much.  Thank you for an awesome recipe and thanks to other reviewers for suggestions on making this

Everyone loved this recipe, I served it with warm naan bread the first day and nachos the second.  I did not have a lemon so used a lime instead which worked out well.

This was a nice dip for some Greek chicken and vegetables we served to guests.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and I made a few alterations.  I used 1 tsp. of pink salt and 1 tsp. of course black pepper , left out the fresh dill and added just a pinch of dry dill, left out the olive oil and I strained my yogurt to thicken it.  I think in the future I will reduce the lemon juice just a little bit.  It seemed to overwhelm the other flavors.  The dip does get better with age.  I think this is something that is easily adjustable to individual preference.  I would have this again but I wouldn't make as much.  We had a ton leftover!

Good tzatziki sauce! I used Greek yogurt and a regular cucumber because that is what I had. I also reduced the salt as recommended.  Let it come together for a while before serving. Very good!

I didn't have to let mine marinate and it was still very tasty. I can only imagine letting it sit in the fridge would have made it better.

I believe that this the best Tzatziki sauce I have ever had, bar none. I used full fat Greek yogurt so there was no need for straining. I only used 16 ounces of yogurt but left everything else the same, except the salt and pepper. I think that 1 Tablespoon of salt and pepper has to be a mistake. I used 1 teaspoon of each and it was perfect. Do not skip the lemon zest; I believe that is what made this so good.

This sounded so good, and I'm trying to find new things for lunches that are low calorie.  I grilled some chicken breasts and made this sauce exactly as is.  I cut up the chicken into strips, take 2-3 of those and about 1-2 oz of the sauce to work and it is perfect!  It tastes better every day!  Thank you for this recipe!  I will make it over and over!

All the right ingredients but WAY to much salt and pepper.  I wonder if the author meant teaspoon.  As is, this recipe is not edible.  Waste of ingredients.  

I made this recipe with only 1 teaspoon of each salt and pepper and it was delicious.

No changes necessary. The second time I made it, I didn't have enough greek yogurt. I added 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 yogurt instead.  It was still good, requiring a little less lemon.

Loved this tzatziki recipe! I didn't have a real lemon on hand, so used lemon juice and omitted the zest. Next time I'll use a real lemon but it was still great without it. Also drained the yogurt, which really made it thick and creamy. This is a keeper!

This was awesome!  I paired it with my Greek chicken kabobs and some warm pita.  GONE!  I used plain Greek  yogurt and grated the peeled cucumber. I pressed between paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. The only alteration I made was I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used Realemon instead.  Came out beautifully thick - not soupy.  Will definitely make this again, and again.

Very tasty. Just another tip to avoid a watery Tzatziki. Squeeze out the grated cucumber between your fingers to get rid of the water. The same advice for watery yoghurt. I also added more lemon juice to get it tasting very zingy and a bit more garlic.

My go-to tzatziki recipe. Delicious and the kids love it just as a dip. Made 1/2 recipe with 1 smallish cucumber. Grated it, took out seeds and drained in a strainer. Then added the rest of the ingredients. Used homegrown fresh dill. Needs less salt, maybe 1 tsp. Nice and thick.

I made the following changes that positively impacted our tzatziki:
*1 large container (35.3 oz) of plain Greek Fage 2% yogurt, no draining or bleeding off whey required.  
*1 whole cucumber - seeded, peeled, grated & squeezed of juice.
*1 1/2 tsp Kosher salt.
*1/2 tsp black pepper, fresh cracked.
*Added 2+ Tbsp fresh mint, chopped.

This is a good recipe all around and easy to follow. I did make a few modifications:  instead of juice from a lemon, I used 4 drops of lemon essential oil; instead of 1 tablespoon of salt, I used four twists of Himalayan salt from a grinder; instead of 1 tablespoon of pepper, I put less than 1/4 tsp.  I also tossed in 1 tablespoon of mint.  After I mixed all of the ingredients, I took a taste test, and the recipe came out fabulous!  It tastes like the restaurant made Tzatziki  sauce that I absolutely love!  Can't wait to taste it after 8 hrs!

Very good. Highly recommended putting your salt over your grated cucumber and pressing the liquid out.

This was too salty for my liking.  
I wish I would have read the previous reviews about the salt. 
The second time I made it, I cut down on the salt and and it was much better.

I have been trying to make a tzatziki I like for such a long time and I finally did it thanks to this recipe! The only things I changed were to eliminate dill (blecch) and roast the garlic before mincing to smooth out the flavor. This sauce is so good I want to lick the plate!

The only thing that would improve this dip is by straining the fresh grated cucumber and the yogurt. It will make it a but thicker. If you like a thinner dip then this is perfect.

Very good.  I think the salt and the lemon need to be cut back but still quite nice.  Do use Greek yogurt.

Loved it. Even more once I added some extra garlic. Other comments about using less salt is true this and the pepper should only be about 1 teaspoon NOT tablespoon

This Tzatiki recipe is great!  Next time I will cut the salt and pepper amount  in half.  It was a little too salty for my taste.  I added sour cream to make it less salty and a little creamier, it tastes amazing!  I highly recommend this recipe!

I made Tzatziki sauce for first time and decided to use this recipe because it called for dill. I did use greek yogurt and strained it for just a few hours in cheesecloth. I don't really feel this was necessary as I collected very little liquid. I have to agree with cutting back on the lemon and salt. I cut back on the  salt by half while making the sauce (as I don't like a lot of salt) but failed to read about cutting back on the lemon. You really need only half of what is called for. I also used only 1 tablespoon of olive oil. I used a regular cucumber, seeded and partially peeled before I grated it. The end result was great. It does however come out thick which is what I intended. For those of you who want a thinner sauce try using half regular yogurt with greek yogurt. To make this recipe I used 4 small (7 oz) containers of Fage 2% greek yogurt.

The people having issues with the saltiness, it is probably your choice of salt, not all salts are created equal.  Based upon the amounts listed they should have been specific about the type of salt.  Use Kosher salt in this recipe not table salt and you will find it is just right.

Very good!  I cut back on the salt, but other than that I followed the recipe.  Actually, since there were only three of us, I made a half recipe.  Looking forward to having more tomorrow.

I will definitely make this again. The one thing I added was about 1/4th cup of cilantro and instead of lemon zest I used lemon pepper and omitted the pepper in the recipe. Oh and less salt as recommended by other users. My husband absolutely loved this with pita chips.

I have made this several times just as it's written and everyone always loves it.  Just make sure to drain the yogurt of some of the liquid, I do this by putting it in a coffee filter in a large mug in the fridge for several hours.  I generally make this sauce a day before I'm going to serve it to allow the flavors to really blend together; it is outstanding and has such a fresh taste to it.

Don't add a tablespoon of salt! Mix all the ingredients, then salt to taste. I made the rookie mistake and just dumped a tablespoon in - wayyy too salty. Were it not for this, I think it's a really good recipe.

I suspect there is a typo in this recipe: The amount of salt and pepper should be one teaspoon and not one tablespoon! I recommend straining the grated cucumber to make it less runny.

Fantastic flavor !     I did make a few adjustments. First I reduced the size so I only made 1 cup. I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup grated cucumber, 1/4 clove garlic, 1/2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1/2 tsp lemon zest, 1 tsp oil, 2 Tbsp dried dill, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. 

Delicious !!  My family gobbled it up. I barely got any, so I have to make more.

Doubled the garlic and halved the salt and pepper. So fresh and delicious! Used Greek low fat strained yogurt and ate it right after making it. Can't wait to try it tomorrow.

Great recipe! I had limes instead of lemons, so I used them.  Mm very good!  I added a touch of agave nectar to cut the tartness of the oikos Greek yogurt I used. We topped our lamb meatballs in a pita  with it.

I do not like dill, so I used mint leaves instead. Also, I use minced garlic for my recipes, as dealing with whole cloves is annoying. Pretty good, but next time I will cut back on the salt.

I was inspired to make this after my boyfriend complained that he was charged a ridiculous fee for extra tzatziki at a local Greek restaurant.  The recipe is excellent.  Just be sure to use Greek (as opposed to regular) yogurt, it will turn out too thin otherwise.

This recipe is easy to follow but I wish that I had read the other member ratings BEFORE I prepared the recipe. WAY too much salt and pepper! They should be cut, AT LEAST, in half. Since I like the crunch, I peeled, seeded and cubed 1 whole regular cucumber. I used Greek yogurt so there was no need to strain. Everything else was fine. Some people commented on the amount of lemon, but I don't mind the sour.

Turned out exactly like the wonderful Greek tzatziki I was craving.  You may want to strain your grated cucumber if it's very juicy.  I seasoned to taste rather than following the recipe exactly.  Also, 32 oz is a huge amount...I would only make a full recipe if I were serving it with gyros.  I only made about a cup to use as a veggie dip for 8 people.

WOW!  Be careful with the salt!  Only added half and that was plenty.  Otherwise very, very good.  Will be using this often.

I thought this was good, but a few more instructions would have helped immensely.  The flavors intensify as they meld in the refrigerator.  I didn't think there was enough dill, added more, and regretted it.  The dill was pretty intense.  I also added 1/4 c. of chopped onion and thought it was better.

Would have been good except for the salt. 1 tbsp. is way too much. I also made the mistake of using no- fat instead of low-fat yogurt which didn't turn out great either.

Hm, couldn't find fresh dill at trader joe's, so I opted for dry dill.

I'd probably like to use Fage greek yogurt for a more thick/creamy sauce next time, instead of the Voskos greek yogurt.

Also, since I don't like eating whole garlic by accident, I'll definitely remove the garlic before serving. 

Otherwise, this recipe was great! Served it with broiled chicken :)

This was delicious! My husband was mad when he found out I was making a healthy dinner, until he tried it. He loved it and wants it again! Thank you for the recipe. It is a little runny, but I couldn't find Greek yogurt at the grocery store and didn't have time to drain the yogurt, but I think it would have turned out perfectly if it was drained.

Perfect, except the recipe calls for WAY too much salt! I didn't even use the the full amount, and it was so salty! Next time, I will just use a pinch or two and I think it will be great!

This was good but did have a little more salt and lemon than I cared for.  I think my lemon may have been TOO juicy, so I am giving it a five star instead of four---blaming my lemon instead of the submitter or the recipe!

I didn't enjoy this as much as my guests did, but I think it was my personal taste buds that got in the way and my impatience to let it set in the fridge for 8 hrs. I used plain Greek yogurt, but forgot to strain the cucumber, so it was a bit runny. But just like Oodles review said I had a friend eating it by the spoonful. Thanks Leelee, I will try this again and try to be patient to let the flavors marry.

This was a very good tasting recipe, but had a little too much dill for my tastes.  I will cut the amount of dill in half the next time.  However, it was still very good, and seemed to get better the more I ate.  I did use Greek yogurt, so I didnt' have to strain it.  I feel like it could have been a little thicker, though...so next time, I will try to drain the cucumber a little more.

Used a whole cucumber - didn't have lemon juice so left it out - I bet if I strained the yogurt and the grated cucumber it would have turned out better - as is now = taste is good but too thin = salad dressing consistency - will try to add a 2nd cucumber strained this time to save it - also added 2 teaspoons of sugar.

Delicious! Next time I will reduce the salt & pepper by half, otherwise very tasty!
