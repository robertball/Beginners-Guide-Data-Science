Giving this a four star rating just because it's not the best BUT it's very good.  The feta adds a nice flavor to the guacamole.

This was tasty! I liked the addition of the feta, which set it apart from the others. Made exactly as written. A nice dip, but not 'THE BEST', IMHO...good though! Thanks for sharing. :)
